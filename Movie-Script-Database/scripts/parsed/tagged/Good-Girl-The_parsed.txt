M: THE GOOD GIRL
M: Written by
M: Mike White
M: JUSTINE
M: (v.o.) As a girl, you see the world
M: like a giant candy store, filled with
M: sweet candy and such. But one day you
M: look around and see a prison and you're
M: on death row. You wanna run, or scream
M: or cry. But something's locking you
M: up. Are the other folks cows, chewing
M: cud till the hour come and their heads
M: roll? Or are they just keeping quiet,
M: like you... Planning their escape?
M: (Camera zooms on Holden/Tom)
M: GWEN
M: On your left, honey.
M: JUSTINE
M: What's that cashier's name?
M: GWEN
M: Can't say.
M: JUSTINE
M: When did he start working here?
M: GWEN
M: Don't know. Yesterday?
M: JUSTINE
M: Who is he?
M: GWEN
M: Don't know. Can't say.
M: JUSTINE
M: What are you doing?
M: GWEN
M: It's called work, princess. Kind of
M: fun. You might want to give it a go
M: someday.
M: CHERYL
M: Attention, shoppers. There's a Retail
M: Rodeo special on aisle three. Liquid
M: drain cleaner. Two 12-ounce cans for
M: $5. Liquid drain cleaner has churning
M: power and will churn right through your
M: pipes. Ladies, shove something clean
M: and new up your filthy pipes. Liquid
M: drain cleaner on aisle three. Have a
M: good day and thank you for shopping
M: at Retail Rodeo.
M: CORNY
M: Hey, Justine. Can I talk to you for
M: a second?
M: JUSTINE
M: Yeah.
M: CORNY
M: I was just curious. Have you ever been
M: to a Bible study?
M: JUSTINE
M: Yeah.
M: CORNY
M: We got a good one going on every Wednesday
M: at the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney
M: comes, Benita comes. You got any interest
M: in reading the Bible?
M: JUSTINE
M: I have my own, you know, beliefs.
M: CORNY
M: We don't preach fire and brimstone.
M: Just the Ten Commandments. Were not
M: interested in scaring people. Were
M: about loving Jesus.
M: JUSTINE
M: I kinda like my nights to myself.
M: CORNY
M: Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal
M: hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you.
M: Drive safe.
M: JUSTINE
M: Bye-bye.
M: BUBBA
M: Hey, Justine.
M: PHIL
M: Hey, Teeny. How was your day?
M: JUSTINE
M: The same. How was yours?
M: BUBBA
M: The wind was flipping paint in our eyes.
M: PHIL
M: Paint stings. Feel like I've been attacked
M: by hornets in my eyeballs.
M: JUSTINE
M: Bubba, stand up.
M: BUBBA
M: Why?
M: JUSTINE
M: For Christ's sakes. Look at that couch,
M: Phil. Y'all got paint all over it. This
M: ain't gonna come off. Damn it, Phil.
M: TV REPORTER
M: ...including this gorgeous eggplant...
M: PHIL
M: I think we got most of it out.
M: JUSTINE
M: You two were stoned. You, keep frying
M: your brain liike that, you'll slip off
M: a ladder and crack open your head bone.
M: You do really stupid things when you're
M: high, Phil.
M: PHIL
M: Like what?
M: JUSTINE
M: Like sitting on my couch with your big
M: blue ass. Everything just turns to shit.
M: You finally get nice things, then everything
M: just gets messed up. Why is this TV
M: buzzing?
M: PHIL
M: It's the wind doing that. They the wind's
M: coming in different lately.
M: JUSTINE
M: Different from what?
M: JUSTINE
M: What you reading?
M: HOLDEN
M: Catcher in the Rye I'm named after
M: it.
M: JUSTINE
M: What's your name? Catcher?
M: HOLDEN
M: Holden. After Holden Caulfield. He's
M: the main character.
M: JUSTINE
M: What's he do?
M: HOLDEN
M: He's put upon by society. Hypocrisy
M: of the world.
M: JUSTINE
M: I notice that you're, uh, not very social.
M: HOLDEN
M: I'm a writer.
M: JUSTINE
M: What do you write?
M: HOLDEN
M: Novels, plays, screenplays, stories,
M: poetry.
M: GWEN
M: (to costumer) That's good. Justine will
M: be right with you. Where is she?
M: JUSTINE
M: I better go. What happens at the end
M: of your book?
M: HOLDEN
M: Oh, he has a nervous breakdown. Goes
M: to a mental hospital.
M: GWEN
M: You don't get paid to pick your crack.
M: You get paid to work.
M: JUSTINE
M: I'm not sure I can do makeovers.
M: GWEN
M: Oh, come on! A little pancake, eyeliner,
M: mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder
M: it up. Then you take a moist tissue,
M: roll it in a ball and toss it in their
M: face! Jeez, Louise... I'm talking to a
M: tree stump! Girl, where are you?!
M: JUSTINE
M: Sorry, Im just a little tired.
M: GWEN
M: It's the food you eat, Justine. Look
M: at me. I am 10 years older than you
M: and have 10 times your energy. Cause
M: I don't eat meat and I don't eat dairy.
M: It's probably why you can't get pregnant,
M: honey. And why you have that hung-jaw
M: look on your face. It's the cheese in
M: your pizza and the chicken in your salad.
M: JUSTINE
M: I went to the doctor. He says I'm fertile.
M: He says I could repopulate the entire
M: planet.
M: GWEN
M: Then what's the deal here? Did he say
M: you get enough vitamins?
M: JUSTINE
M: He didn't say.
M: PHIL
M: You could make paint where, at different
M: angles, the house is different colours.
M: You stand at the front door and the
M: house is red. You stand at the street
M: and the house is green. Or you could
M: make, like, an invisible paint. Make
M: the whole house disappear.
M: BUBBA
M: What would be really neat is a paint
M: that could change the molecular structure
M: of a house, like a chemical acid deal.
M: PHIL
M: What do you think, Teeny?
M: JUSTINE
M: I think you two are a pair of potheads.
M: CHERYL
M: You getting a whole one of these or
M: a half?
M: CUSTOMER
M: That oneright there.
M: CHERYL
M: You didn't bring this into the store?
M: CUSTOMER
M: No.
M: CHERYL
M: Well then, I'll charge you for it. This
M: is a hand lotion. So don't put it anywhere
M: else, even if you need lubrication.
M: We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to
M: a minimum, unless, ofcourse, the customer
M: is at fault. Here's your change and
M: Fuck you very much.
M: CUSTOMER
M: Excuse me?
M: CHERYL
M: Thank you very much.
M: GWEN
M: Good as new, I'll tell ya, good as new.
M: JUSTINE
M: Now, you might be interested in purchasing
M: some of the products I used today...
M: CUSTOMER
M: Oh, I'm not buying anything today.
M: GWEN
M: Well, that'd be a mistake. These are
M: bargain prices.
M: CUSTOMER
M: I didn't bring my purse.
M: JUSTINE
M: I hate my job.
M: HOLDEN
M: That makes two of us.
M: JUSTINE
M: I hate everyone here. I hate Gwen. I
M: don't know what the hell she's so happy
M: about. I'm sorry I don't understand
M: why maniacs get shotguns and shoot everybody
M: to pieces.
M: HOLDEN
M: Maybe you're a maniac.
M: JUSTINE
M: Maybe so. You know you're lips are real
M: pouty, like a woman. And how your eyes
M: droop off to the side. How old are you?
M: HOLDEN
M: Twenty two.
M: JUSTINE
M: I'm an old lady next to you.
M: HOLDEN
M: How old are you?
M: JUSTINE
M: How old do you think?
M: HOLDEN
M: I don't know.
M: JUSTINE
M: I am thirty years old.
M: HOLDEN
M: How long you been workin' here for?
M: JUSTINE
M: Forever and a day!
M: JUSTINE
M: You don't have a car?
M: HOLDEN
M: Oh, I live right down the street.
M: JUSTINE
M: Well, you can ride in here, there's
M: room.
M: HOLDEN
M: You wanna come in?
M: JUSTINE
M: I don't know. I'm in a funk.
M: HOLDEN
M: Well, I'm not gonna beg ya.
M: HOLDEN
M: I'll be in my room.
M: MOTHER
M: Okay, Tom.
M: JUSTINE
M: They call you Tom?
M: HOLDEN
M: It's my slave name. Holden's what I
M: call myself. This is my room.
M: JUSTINE
M: Not aolt to look at. What are your folks
M: like?
M: HOLDEN
M: They're okay. They don't get me. I mean,
M: they're alright.
M: JUSTINE
M: My husband doesn't get me.
M: HOLDEN
M: Since when do you have a husband?
M: JUSTINE
M: Since seven years. He's a painter.
M: HOLDEN
M: What's he paint?
M: JUSTINE
M: Houses. He's a pig. He talks but he
M: doesn't think. You go to college?
M: HOLDEN
M: Um, I had to drop out. I had a problem
M: with drinkin' and stuff. I'll go back.
M: I just gotta prove to my parents that
M: I can fly staright. You go to college?
M: JUSTINE
M: No, I was afraid I'd lose Phil if I
M: went. Now that'd be reason enough to
M: go. I saw you in the store and I liked
M: how you kept to yourself. I can see
M: in your eyes that you hate the world.
M: I hate it too. You know what I'm talkin'
M: about?
M: JUSTINE
M: After livin in the dark for so long
M: a glimspe of the light can make you
M: giddy. Strange thought come into your
M: head and you'd better think 'em. Has
M: a special fate been callin' you and
M: you not listenin? Is there a secret
M: message right in front you, and you're
M: not reading it? Is this your last, best
M: chance? Are you gonna take it? Or are
M: you goin' to the grave with unlived
M: lives in your vains?
M: (TV conversation)
M: PHIL
M: Teeny, you're pretty. Bubba, isn't Teeny
M: pretty?
M: BUBBA
M: I've seen better, I've seen worse. Nah.
M: That's why I ain't never married. You
M: got yourself the best fish in the sea.
M: PHIL
M: I wonder what it'd be like to be a woman.
M: All that smooth skin and long hair.
M: BUBBA
M: If I was a woman, I'd be a slut. A lesbian
M: slut.
M: JUSTINE
M: Gwen says smokin' marijuana lowers your
M: sperm.
M: PHIL
M: Lowers it to where?
M: JUSTINE
M: Maybe you're the infertile one 'round
M: here. Maybe every time you smoke a little
M: dooby, you're killin' our unborn children.
M: GWEN
M: Alright, close.
M: JUSTINE
M: Why you limping.
M: HOLDEN
M: I twisted up my ankle on the stairs.
M: I was wonderin', maybe you could give
M: me a ride home?
M: JUSTINE
M: Yeah, sure okay.
M: HOLDEN
M: Alright I'll talk to you about it later.
M: GWEN
M: All I know is, everyone should have
M: one beau, before anyone has two beaus.
M: JUSTINE
M: He's not my beau, he's my friend.
M: CHERYL
M: Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers!
M: There's a Retail Rodeo special on all
M: bulk candy on aisle four. Ghouls and
M: goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering
M: these aisles, day after day. I'll put
M: a Halloween curse on you.
M: GWEN
M: Night Corny. Happy Halloween.
M: CORNY
M: Well I'm not a pagen but thanks all
M: the same.
M: GWEN
M: Which ankle did you twist, Holden?
M: HOLDEN
M: My, uh, left.
M: GWEN
M: Maybe you should put some cold water
M: on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame.
M: HOLDEN
M: Okay.
M: JUSTINE
M: You're a writer so you have yourself
M: a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine
M: other cities, other jobs I could have.
M: Other husbands. Now I don't even know
M: what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have
M: a husband.
M: HOLDEN
M: You said he was a pig.
M: JUSTINE
M: Well, Holden. I don't want to hurt anybody.
M: (TV sounds)
M: PHIL
M: I was thinking about what you were sayin'
M: about my sperm bein' low. I mean, I
M: know I got good sperm. It's baby-makin
M: sperm. I suppose it couldn't hurt to
M: have it confirmed by an expert.
M: JUSTINE
M: Oh who gives a shit, who needs a F&$%'
M: baby around here anyways? If you wanna
M: make yourself useful, why don't you
M: get that goddamn TV fixed?!
M: PHIL
M: What the hell?
M: JUSTINE
M: It sounds like a helicopter is landin'
M: in here.
M: GWEN
M: You want a blackberry, honey? A man
M: was sellin' 'em on the road.
M: JUSTINE
M: No thank you.
M: CORNY
M: This is for you Justine. It's from Holden.
M: JUSTINE
M: Well where is he?
M: CORNY
M: He's got the day off. He came by this
M: morning with it.
M: JUSTINE
M: Thanks.
M: CORNY
M: Don't mention it. Hey, Gwen.
M: GWEN
M: Hey sugar.
M: HOLDEN
M: Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be
M: quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last
M: two days have been the most god-awful
M: days of my life. I've not been able
M: to get rid of you in my head. I never
M: wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted
M: many things. I'd given up long ago on
M: being gotten by someone else, and then
M: you came along. The idea of being gotten,
M: because of circumstance, will never
M: get got is the worst feeling I've ever
M: felt, and I have felt many bad feelings.
M: I'm sorry I can never see you again,
M: Justine, forgive me for being so weak,
M: but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden
M: Wurther. If for some reason, you could
M: change your mind and want to be with
M: me, body and soul, meet me after work.
M: I will be waiting for you at five PM
M: outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not
M: there at five, you will never see me
M: in your lifetime.
M: JUSTINE
M: Gwen? What's wrong?
M: Gwen I'm okay. I feel a little sick.
M: JUSTINE
M: Gwen? Gwen you sick?
M: JACK
M: Justine? Justine what's goin' on in
M: here? Gwen, you sick? We gotta get her
M: to a hospital. Justine you drive her.
M: JUSTINE
M: Well what time is it?
M: JACK
M: It's aquarter to five. Why, you gotta
M: be somewhere?
M: JUSTINE
M: Gwen?
M: GWEN
M: Oh, I had a dream. I had dream that
M: I sprouted a beard made of bean sprouts.
M: JUSTINE
M: I'm gonna let you off here, okay?
M: GWEN
M: Okay,You'll meet me inside?
M: JUSTINE
M: Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm
M: gonna park the car, then I'm gonna meet
M: you inside.
M: GWEN
M: Okay. Your a doll.
M: HOLDEN
M: Hey. Oh god, I'm really glad you came.
M: JUSTINE
M: I just ditched Gwen at the hospital.
M: HOLDEN
M: Oh god, thank god.
M: JUSTINE
M: Where are we goin'?
M: HOLDEN
M: Let's go to my house.
M: JUSTINE
M: No, with your folks there?
M: HOLDEN
M: Let's just park somewhere.
M: JUSTINE
M: This isn't well planned.
M: HOLDEN
M: Look. I don't know. I don't care I just
M: wanna hold you.
M: HOTEL GUY
M: That's fourty five dollars even. And
M: I need you to fill this out for me.
M: (Justine and Holden are in the hotel room and make love.)
M: (after the made love)
M: JUSTINE
M: I can't do it.
M: HOLDEN
M: We'll be back here before you know it.
M: JUSTINE
M: I don't wanna... I don't wanna go.
M: HOLDEN
M: Justine. I'm yours. I'm all yours.
M: (they kiss)
M: PHIL
M: Hey.
M: JUTSINE
M: Hey.
M: PHIL
M: Were you been?
M: JUSTINE
M: Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin'
M: up all over the store. I had to take
M: her to the hositpal, and sat with her.
M: PHIL
M: Did she sick up on you?
M: JUSTINE
M: No.
M: PHIL
M: Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles)
M: JUSTINE
M: It's not funny, Phil, this is serious.
M: I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too.
M: And the next day.
M: JACK
M: Justine? What happened to you?
M: JUSTINE
M: What?
M: JACK
M: I went down to St. Catherine's to check
M: up on Gwen. I looked all over for you,
M: she was askin' for you.
M: JUSTINE
M: Well, how is she?
M: JACK
M: She was heavin' up until there was nothin'
M: left to heave. Doctor said she must've
M: eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite
M: in it or somethin'.
M: JUSTINE
M: I bet it was those blackberries.
M: JACK
M: They're gonna keep her in there until
M: she gets better so you're gonna have
M: to supervise cosmetics.
M: (there they go again)
M: JUSTINE
M: Stop it, somebody's gonna see!
M: HOLDEN
M: Who cares, I don't care. I crave you.
M: I wanna know everything about you. Who
M: are you?
M: JUSTINE
M: I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas
M: when I was eleven. My daddy was in the
M: Air Force.
M: HOLDEN
M: I wanna knock open your head and see
M: what's inside. I've had so much pain
M: in my life. I know you have too, I can
M: see it.
M: (at the hotel, in bed,
M: probably after they made love)
M: JUSTINE
M: Holden gave me two of his stories to
M: read. It's like what a story would be.
M: I was about a boy who was put upon,
M: his mother was cold and selfish, and
M: his father wanted him to play football.
M: Other people didn't get him, especially
M: girls. Then the boy comes to believe
M: no one can ever really know him. So
M: he starts actin' out, drinkin', and
M: doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end
M: the boy kills himself but jumpin' over
M: abridge. The second story was pretty
M: much the same as the first. Except at
M: the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin'
M: a bottle of bug poison.
M: JUSTINE
M: Your stories are intense.
M: HOLDEN
M: I just wanna leave some kind of legacy.
M: Somethin' great. After that I don't
M: care what happens to me.
M: JUSTINE
M: Don't say that. I wish there was a story
M: about me. I don't know who would read
M: it though.
M: HOLDEN
M: I would.
M: JUSTINE
M: I like this. I like havin' a secret.
M: You gave me a secret Holden.
M: HOLDEN
M: Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious.
M: And dark and twisted.
M: JUSTINE
M: I'm going to hell, aren't I?
M: HOLDEN
M: Yes, you are.
M: (she rolls on top of him and they kiss)
M: (they exit the hotel and Justine sees a car)
M: JUSTINE
M: That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car.
M: Phil takes that truck to work everyday.
M: Bubba picks him up, and drops him off.
M: Why, why would that truck be parked
M: there?
M: HOLDEN
M: I don't know.
M: JUSTINE
M: If he finds out about us....
M: HOLDEN
M: I won't let him hurt you.
M: JUSTINE
M: He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll
M: beat me, but he'll kill you.
M: HOLDEN
M: You can't worry about somethin' that
M: hasn't even happened yet.
M: JUSTINE
M: I gotta go to the hospital.
M: HOLDEN
M: Okay. (leans in to kiss her; she pulls
M: away)
M: JUSTINE
M: Don't! I mean he could be followin'
M: us.
M: CORNY
M: Justine! Poor lady. She just passed.
M: JUSTINE
M: Who?
M: CORNY
M: Gwen! She just passed away.
M: JUSTINE
M: What do you mean? I thought she had
M: a stomach ache?
M: CORNY
M: It got worse. She was on life support
M: all day.
M: JUSTINE
M: I don't understand.
M: CORNY
M: It's God's will, Justine. No one can
M: understand it. It was just Gwen's time
M: to fly away home.
M: (Justine looks guilty and shocked)
M: JUSTINE
M: Gwen died today.
M: PHIL
M: What? Are you kiddin? What for?
M: JUSTINE
M: Parasite. Somethin' she ate.
M: PHIL
M: You okay?
M: JUSTINE
M: Where were you this afternoon?
M: PHIL
M: Paintin' on Bovery. Why?
M: JUSTINE
M: What time did Bubba bring you home?
M: PHIL
M: We knocked off early 'bout four. Bubba
M: had a date with a stewardess, why?
M: JUSTINE
M: Oh. I can't believe she's dead. I wasn't
M: a very good friend to her.
M: PHIL
M: Don't say that, Teeny. 'Course you were.
M: 'Course you were.
M: JACK
M: Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack
M: Fields, your store manager. Before we
M: open today, I just want to share some
M: terrible and shocking news. One of our
M: best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday.
M: Gwen was a real class act. She had a
M: good attitude, she had ideas. We're
M: all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all
M: need to collect you thoughts and remember
M: Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll
M: be excused from work and we'll just
M: have to do without you. Gwen, this one's
M: for you.
M: (music comes over PA)
M: JUSTINE
M: Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's
M: Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love.
M: He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin'
M: around around in the sticks and the
M: dirt and bein' one with nature. He was
M: so fixed on the idea thateven when the
M: clouds started rollin' in, and the sky
M: was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'.
M: All my thoughts turned to death. I thought
M: of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought
M: of how nice a person she was, so full
M: of life and good will. If there was
M: a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin'
M: makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice.
M: I thought if I died today, what would
M: happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish
M: girl. An adultress. A liar.
M: (Justine and Holden are running towards the car and get in)
M: (Next scene they're in the car; back seats, kissing)
M: JUSTINE
M: What are we doin'?
M: HOLDEN
M: Makin' one out of two.
M: JUSTINE
M: (sighs) I haven't thought this through.
M: HOLDEN
M: Justine, will you leave him?
M: JUSTINE
M: And go where?
M: HOLDEN
M: Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll
M: think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin'
M: I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend,
M: a pretty one, who knows me and likes
M: me. And they'll be so happy, they'll
M: give me money to write my novel.
M: JUSTINE
M: But where will we GO?
M: HOLDEN
M: We'll be like... Catcher in the Rye.
M: Only by me. I'll be immortal and then
M: like JD Salinger I'll just vanish.
M: PHIL
M: Hey, Teeny. We've been up to no good.
M: We got the day off on account of the
M: rain.
M: JUSTINE
M: I thought you might.
M: (TV sounds)
M: BUBBA
M: So I heard about your friend bein' dead,
M: and all. I'm sorry.
M: JUSTINE
M: Yeah. She was real healthy too.
M: BUBBA
M: Well, at least you were with her when
M: she went. (intense voice and look) Ain't
M: that right? You were... with her, when
M: she went?
M: JUSTINE
M: Yeah.
M: PHIL
M: Oh, I wish it would rain every day from
M: here on out. Never have to paint again.
M: JACK
M: Hey Justine. How you holding up?
M: JUSTINE
M: Fine.
M: JACK
M: Real shocker. I decided to move Cheryl
M: over to cosmetics. She got a little
M: too creative on the P.A. Maybe she'll
M: watch her P's and Q's over here. If
M: not she's out on her but. Now you listen
M: to Justine, sister.
M: HOLDEN
M: You want me to help you get stuff out
M: of storage?
M: JUSTINE
M: Not right now, maybe later.
M: HOLDEN
M: Well, are you gonna give me a ride home?
M: My ankle's actin' up.
M: JUSTINE
M: I gotta get home. Maybe Cheryl can.
M: CHERYL
M: What, you need a ride?
M: HOLDEN
M: Forget it.
M: JUSTINE
M: I think we gotta take a breather. I'm
M: nervous.
M: HOLDEN
M: Well, can't we go to the motel?
M: JUSTINE
M: Not today.
M: HOLDEN
M: Well, let's go in the store room.
M: JUSTINE
M: Just be patient, Holden!
N: (Holden looks freaky; sort of like he's losing his mind not being able to be close to her)
C: JUSTINE
D: I was wonderin', when was that, uh, bible study?
C: CORNY
D: Tomorrow night at eight. We'd love to have ya.
C: JUSTINE
D: Can I bring my husband?
C: CORNY
D: 'Course! A couple that prays together stays together.
C: PHIL
D: What's this?
C: JUSTINE
D: The Holy Bible. There's one for you, and one for me.
C: PHIL
D: Not very light is it?
C: JUSTINE
D: We're goin' to Bible study. A couple that prays together, stays together.
C: PHIL
D: I heard it was the couple that lays together stays together.
C: JUSTINE
D: Well you heard wrong.
C: JUSTINE
D: Cheryl? You think you can take this one?
C: CHERYL
D: Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're gonna make you pretty. Now how do you like your hair?
C: CUSTOMER
D: Wait, you gonna do my hair?
C: CHERYL
D: No, I just need to know if that's your usual way of wearing it all big and high. If it is then I'll just put more makeup on your chin to off-set. Now, you're gonna want to take a whole bottle of this home wtih you. It's got quite alot of ingredients in it so you're getting a good deal. It's got Ginco extract in it, do you know what that is?
C: CUSTOMER
D: No.
C: CHERYL
D: It's extract of the Ginco and it makes your skin real slick so that any liquid will roll right off, be it water or lemon juice or urine. I'll put that in a bag for you.
C: JUSTINE
D: Phil, what the hell are you doin'? We're gonna be late for Bible study. You're stoned, you got paint in your hair, would you just get in the shower?
C: PHIL
D: I completely didn't remember...
C: JUSTINE
D: Get in the shower.
C: BUBBA
D: Workin' on your spiritual life?
C: JUSTINE
D: Yeah, I guess.
C: BUBBA
D: Ain't that a hoot and a holler.
C: JUSTINE
D: What do you mean?
C: BUBBA
D: I saw you, Justine.
C: JUSTINE
D: Saw me what?
C: BUBBA
D: I saw you. We got some things to talk about, you and me. You come by my place after work. If you knwo what's good for ya.
C: PHIL
D: Hey. Where's Bubba?
C: JUSTINE
D: He left.
C: PHIL
D: Well, I'm ready. Let's go.
C: PHIL
D: I don't know what to say about Jesus. I'm stoned.
C: JUSTINE
D: Just let the other people do the talking.
C: PHIL
D: Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine.
C: JUSTINE
D: Well, that's alright, they'll forgive us.
C: CORNY
D: Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad you could make it!
C: JUSTINE
D: Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil.
C: CORNY
D: Y'all are in for a treat. We got a good discussion going tonight. If man is made in God's image, what does that say about God?
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, that sounds like a good one.
N: (Justine recognizes one of the people. It's the guy who works at the motel where she and Holden have been going to.)
C: JUSTINE
D: Phil, come with me to the car.
C: PHIL
D: What?
C: JUSTINE
D: Come with me to the car, I gotta get somethin'.
C: PHIL
D: What's goin' on?
C: JUSTINE
D: Just get in the car. Get in the car, Phil.
C: PHIL
D: What the hell?
C: JUSTINE
D: I don't want to go to Bible study.
C: PHIL
D: Why not?
C: JUSTINE
D: Because I don't want to. Now, can we please just get out of here?
C: PHIL
D: Justine, this is embarassing. We're runnin' away from Bible study like a couple of Devil worshippers.
C: JUSTINE
D: I don't care. I'm not in the mood.
C: PHIL
D: You are freakin' me out, man. Why?
C: JUSTINE
D: Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is why.
C: PHIL
D: You just said a few minutes ago they'll forgive us.
C: JUSTINE
D: Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So can we please just get the shit outta here?
C: PHIL
D: I'm never goin' back to Bible study again.
C: JUSTINE
D: I don't care, fine by me.
C: CUSTOMER
D: I think I look too white, don't you think?
C: CHERYL
D: I'm just tryin' to match your face with your hair, I was thinkin' you're not white enough.
C: CUSTOMER
D: I think I look kinda wierd.
C: CHERYL
D: Well, the first rule of fashion is that you have to look wierd. What I'm doing here has come straight from France.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Oh.
C: CHERYL
D: It's called circ du face, meaning circus of the face and it's all the rage with the Frenchies.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Well, you're the professoinal.
C: CHERYL
D: That's right.
C: CORNY
D: Justine, what happened to you? I looked up and I saw you two drivin' off like vampires in the night.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles.
C: CORNY
D: You coulda looked off your neighbor. It's a church, you know. You can't make water without bumpin' your nut on a bible.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh. Well, we felt bad.
C: CORNY
D: What in blazes?!
E: looks at the customer
C: CUSTOMER
D: Do you like it?
C: JUSTINE
D: I can't go.
C: HOLDEN
D: What?
C: JUSTINE
D: I can't go today. There's something important I need to tend to.
C: HOLDEN
D: I thought you said we'd go today.
C: JUSTINE
D: Well, something came up.
C: HOLDEN
D: What came up?
C: JUSTINE
D: Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody's found out about us.
C: HOLDEN
D: I'm starting to wonder if you even want to go. I'm startin' to think you don't get me.
C: JUSTINE
D: Well, maybe I don't get you.
C: HOLDEN
D: You do, you do get me you just don't want to me 'cause I'm too intensified for you! Justine, who cares, who cares if someone finds out. We don't have to live like this, Justine. I know what it's like to go home every night and feel like you're hidin' out. We can leave all this behind...
C: JUSTINE
D: That's easy for you to say, Holden, you are not married.
C: HOLDEN
D: You just, you just gonna give up?! You gonna go crawlin' back?!
C: JUSTINE
D: Holden, you are gonna get us caught!
C: HOLDEN
D: You're so fucking afraid it makes me sick. Don't give up on us.
C: JUSTINE
D: I won't.
N: (Justine goes out of the backdoor of Retail Rodeo, takes a few deep breaths, trying not to freak out)
C: JUSTINE
D: I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?
C: HOLDEN
D: Okay. Good luck on your important thing.
C: JUSTINE
D: Thanks.
N: (Justine arrives at Bubba's. He opens the door and his dog, Bitz, is barking.)
C: BUBBA
D: Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner! Back in your corner! Back in your corner, Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'. Sit. I'm in shock.
E: Yells at dog again
C: JUSTINE
D: Why?
C: BUBBA
D: You know why.
C: JUSTINE
D: Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak. Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life. He talked about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me. And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary girl like me, that he never found. Then he wen on about givin' up your dreams and how it's all a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and forever. Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open. Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work. The sounds of me makin' love to a man that wasn't Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear from the creator himself. What it meant, or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long. I was no longer Bubba's image of perfection. To him I was just a liar, and a whore, and that sickened him. But on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do. Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle.
C: JUSTINE
D: Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.
C: BUBBA
D: But don't you see? This is my chance, for liberation.
C: JUSTINE
D: But, one person's liberation is another person's, well, badness. There's just no way.
C: BUBBA
D: I'm gonna have to tell Phil then.
C: JUSTINE
D: Why?
C: BUBBA
D: He's my best friend. I can't keep him in the dark about somethin' this big. He's a cuckhold.
C: JUSTINE
D: You wanna cuckhold him yourself!
C: BUBBA
D: Well that's different. That isn't about him. That's about my salvation. Look, you've got your choice to make. Either destroy your marriage, and break your husband's heart. Or have sex with me right now.
N: (Bubba is yelling at the dog again, and saying Justine's name)
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh god! There was someone in the window! Did you not see?
C: BUBBA
D: You're paranoid.
C: JUSTINE
D: I gotta go.
C: BUBBA
D: Phil is never gonna find out about any of this. Don't fret.
E: the dog is still barking
C: JUSTINE
D: Get this damn dog away from me!
C: BUBBA
D: You're lookin' at a free man, Justine. A free man.
C: JUSTINE
D: Great. Good for you.
C: BUBBA
D: Thank you.
E: Yelling at dog again.
N: (TV sounds as Phil comes out of the bathroom, still brushing his teeth)
C: PHIL
D: I'm nervous.
C: JUSTINE
D: You're nervous? Why?
C: PHIL
D: 'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow and jism into a cup, that's why. What if I can't do it?
C: JUSTINE
D: You can do it.
C: PHIL
D: You know, If you said you'd help me I'd feel alot less nervous. It's gonna be on your lunch hour anyway.
C: JUSTINE
D: Okay.
C: PHIL
D: You didn't even say nothing about the TV bein' fixed.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh. Is it? Thanks.
C: PHIL
D: You're welcome.
C: JACK
D: Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you talked to Holden lately? He didn't show up for work today, I wanna know what gives. I know you two are friends.
C: JUSTINE
D: We're not friends.
C: JACK
D: You eat lunch together every day.
C: JUSTINE
D: No, we don't.
C: JACK
D: Well, if you see him, tell him Jack Fields is lookin' for him.
N: (Justine gets in the car and is shocked when she sees Holden in the car, more depressed than ever.)
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh my god. What are you doin'?
C: HOLDEN
D: You're a hooker, you hooker.
C: JUSTINE
D: I saw you. You followed me.
C: HOLDEN
D: So, how many guys you gettin' with? You gettin' with every guy in the state?
C: JUSTINE
D: No, Holden, this is all because of you. He had me over a barrel. If I didn't sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil about us!
C: HOLDEN
D: I'm so alone!
C: JUSTINE
D: You've gotta get a hold of yourself! Are you drunk?
C: HOLDEN
D: Yes, I'm drunk! And I'll be drunk every day until the day I die! What do you care?! You jump on any pecker that's put in front of you!
C: JUSTINE
D: It's not what you think.
C: HOLDEN
D: I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.
C: JUSTINE
D: Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me after work.
C: HOLDEN
D: Where you goin'?
C: JUSTINE
D: I gotta help Phil with his sperm.
C: HOLDEN
D: What?
C: JUSTINE
D: Just go. Go!
C: HOLDEN
D: I can't share you, Justine! Maybe with one man but not with a whole bunch of 'em!
C: JUSTINE
D: Great.
C: NURSE
D: Mr. Last? Would you come with me?
C: PHIL
D: Wish me luck.
C: JUSTINE
D: Good luck, honey.
C: BUBBA
D: Knock 'em dead, partner. You look nice.
E: Justine and Bubba watch Phil walk into one of the rooms
C: JUSTINE
D: No, I don't.
C: BUBBA
D: I know you're angry and I can figure why. But, from where I stand, what happened yesterday was a wonderful thing.
C: JUSTINE
D: Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it.
C: BUBBA
D: Well, I'm awful grateful to ya, Justine.
C: JUSTINE
D: Bubba, I mean it.
C: BUBBA
D: Let me just ask you one thing. How do I stack up against Phil? You know, how do I stack up where it counts?
C: NURSE
D: Ma'am? Your husband asked me to request for your presence.
N: (Justine knocks on the door.)
C: PHIL
D: Who's there?
C: JUSTINE
D: It's Justine.
E: gets into the room
C: PHIL
D: C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I need help.
C: JUSTINE
D: You've never done it on your own?
C: PHIL
D: Not in a place like this! Not where I have to hand over the results! Just, let me hold your boob.
N: (holds her boob; Justine's face is full of pain)
C: JUSTINE
D: Ah, they're sore.
E: Justine looks fed up with everything
C: CHERYL
D: What's wrong with you? You look like death.
C: JUSTINE
D: My stomach's crampin'. I feel sore.
C: CHERYL
D: Is it your period?
C: JUSTINE
D: Nah, it's stress.
C: CHERYL
D: This job is stressful. I'm breaking out.
C: JUSTINE
D: You're breakin' out 'cause you put so much makeup on your face.
C: CHERYL
D: Maybe you're pregnant.
C: JUSTINE
D: What?... No...
E: thinks about it
C: HOLDEN
D: You know, sometimes, I think to myself, at least it can't get any worse. But it can. I can worse. As long as you can say you've hit rock bottom you can.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh my god, Blackberries.
C: HOLDEN
D: A blind man can go deaf. A widow can lose her children. Babies starve and they never get food. They never get any food. They just come into the world and they die.
C: JUSTINE
D: Calm down, Holden!
C: HOLDEN
D: I can't calm down! I'd be easy if I was a hooker like you. I could calm down all over town.
C: JUSTINE
D: Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.
C: HOLDEN
D: I know you're not. I'm in agony.
C: JUSTINE
D: Why?
C: HOLDEN
D: What do you mean 'why'? I thought you hated your life.
C: JUSTINE
D: I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You are really depressed.
C: HOLDEN
D: I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal the money whatever it takes. You just, just whatever you want as long as it's you and me. Please don't forsake me Justine.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh... I, I promise.
E: car is parked somewhere; Justine and Holden are sitting on the car, Holden's smoking
C: JUSTINE
D: I realized then that Holden was at best a child, and at worst a demon. If I was ever gonna go straight I'd have to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops.
N: (Justine goes up to the "Blackberry Man")
C: JUSTINE
D: How much are the blackberries?
C: BLACKBERRY MAN
D: A tin for two dollars, miss. There you go.
E: gives her the blackberries
C: JUSTINE
D: Thank you.
N: (Holden and Justine are in the car again, Justine's driving)
C: JUSTINE
D: Have a blackberry.
C: HOLDEN
D: We need a plan. We can't keep livin' day to day. We gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick....
C: JUSTINE
D: Have a blackberry, Holden!
C: HOLDEN
D: But, they're dirty. They're sweet. If I could only get my hands on some money, someone could just tell me the answer. I gotta do. But If I ever do, I end up thinking about it instead. I gotta do. But do what? What...? What was that for?
E: hesitating, he eats a blackberry and then smiles Justine pushes the blackberry he's about to eat away from his mouth
C: JUSTINE
D: They looked dirty. I, I think I saw a bug in them or something.
N: (Jack talking to Holden about something) (Justine's talking to Holden's parents.)
C: JUSTINE
D: I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, and now, well, I think he's mentally ill. He has this idea in his head that we've had some sort of affair. Which is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's been sayin' all sorts of strange things, and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And, and I just think he would be better off in a place where people, professionals, could take care of him. Otherwise, he's just gonna get himself in trouble.
C: PHIL
D: What are you doin' in here? What's that?
C: JUSTINE
D: It's a home pregnancy test.
C: PHIL
D: Why you takin' it?
C: JUSTINE
D: 'Cause I still haven't gotten my period.
C: PHIL
D: What's it say?
C: JUSTINE
D: Well, I haven't taken it yet. Could you give me a minute please?
C: PHIL
D: I wanna be here when you find out.
C: JUSTINE
D: Okay.
C: PHIL
D: The little plastic doohickey's turnin' blue. What's that mean?
C: JUSTINE
D: Blue?
C: PHIL
D: Bright blue.
C: JUSTINE
D: It means I'm pregnant.
C: PHIL
D: ALRIGHT!
C: PHIL
D: I knew it. Waste of time going to that sperm doctor. We did it. We're gonna have ourselves a baby.
C: JUSTINE
D: Maybe.
C: PHIL
D: And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna bring Bubba. You can bring some of your friends from work. Or Bible study guy. Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead.
C: JUSTINE
D: The test could be wrong, Phil. It's a little early to be havin' a party.
C: PHIL
D: Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't seem too excited.
C: JUSTINE
D: No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of worries come with havin' a baby...
C: PHIL
D: Don't think negative. Think positive. We could have ourselves a tiny Phil. Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have a tiny weeny Teeny.
C: JUSTINE
D: Do you think anything's gonna change havin' a baby?
C: PHIL
D: What do you mean? Everything's gonna change.
C: JUSTINE
D: Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's really gonna change?
C: PHIL
D: What do ya mean?
N: (Holden and his parents sit on the couch and watch TV when the phone rings. Holden gets it.)
C: HOLDEN
D: Hello?
E: picks up the phone
C: WOMAN
D: Hi, this is Dr. Williams returning the call of Jean Worther. I'm calling from the Holland County psychiatric hospital.
E: Holden hangs up
C: MOTHER
D: Who was it, Tom?
C: HOLDEN
D: It was a wrong number.
N: (Holden goes into his room with a crazy smile on his face. He starts to laugh. When he hears the phone ring again, he stops smiling and starts to look like he's thinking of something.)
C: JACK
D: Either of you seen Holden? Boy is out on his ass!
C: CHERYL
D: Justine, somethin's goin' on. Something is definately happening.
C: JUSTINE
D: Go find out.
C: CHERYL
D: It's big. It's very big.
C: JUSTINE
D: C'mon Cheryl, I'm gonna kill you.
C: CHERYL
D: Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe. They blew the thing open with a gun.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh my god.
C: CHERYL
D: Not only that but the cops know who did it.
C: JUSTINE
D: Who?
C: CHERYL
D: Somebody who works here.
C: JUSTINE
D: Cheryl!
C: CHERYL
D: Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his cashier key in the door.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh my god.
C: CHERYL
D: They can't find him though. They say he robbed his folks too. You in on it?
C: JUSTINE
D: What?! No!
C: CHERYL
D: I know you two played hookie in the store room. I never rat on ya, I've done some things myself. But, still. You in on it?
C: JUSTINE
D: I don't know what you're talkin' about.
C: CHERYL
D: Suit yourself.
C: CORNY
D: Justine. Can we talk to you for a second?
C: JACK
D: Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat.
C: CORNY
D: Justine, you like workin' at the Retail Rodeo don't you? Like the company, like the people? You wouldn't want to jeopardize that by makin' some silly error in judgement would ya?
C: JACK
D: Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe last night. Did you have anything to do with it?
C: JUSTINE
D: No. I don't know anything.
C: CORNY
D: 'Cause we know you're pretty tight with Holden.
C: JUSTINE
D: I hardly know him.
C: CORNY
D: I've seen you in the store room with him Justine. On many the occasion. I think you know him pretty well.
C: JUSTINE
D: I don't know anything.
C: HOLDEN
D: Justine! Justine!
C: HOLDEN
D: I did it! I finally did somethin'!
C: JUSTINE
D: Holden, the police are lookin' for you!
C: HOLDEN
D: Oh, who cares? I'm proud of myself. Fuck them, Fuck all of them!
C: JUSTINE
D: Hey! They think that I'm in on it, too! Corny's got a camera in that storage room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's been watchin' us the whole time.
C: HOLDEN
D: Well, we're outta here! Justine, I got over twenty thousand dollars! I got a gun, what else?!
C: JUSTINE
D: I'm gettin' all goosey. I think I'm gonna crash. I'm pregnant, Holden.
E: takes a right turn and stops the car
C: HOLDEN
D: It's my baby.
C: JUSTINE
D: Not necessarily.
C: HOLDEN
D: Yes, it is. You know it is.
C: JUSTINE
D: Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby on the run.
C: HOLDEN
D: Yes, you can. I mean, you can't raise a baby here. You know that. Justine. You hate your husband. You hate your job. You love me, so let's go.
C: JUSTINE
D: I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my things and I'd have to get more money.
C: HOLDEN
D: Well, then tomorrow. I'll go to the motel and wait for you. Just be there by noon.
C: JUSTINE
D: This is all going too fast.
C: HOLDEN
D: Justine, what have you got to lose?
C: JUSTINE
D: Nothin'.
C: HOLDEN
D: So be there by noon.
C: JUSTINE
D: Okay.
C: HOLDEN
D: I love you, Justine. This is all gonna work out. I know it. I almost forgot. This is a story of your life. You inspired me.
E: they kiss and Holden gets out of the car
C: PHIL
D: Hey Teeny!
C: JUSTINE
D: Hey.
C: PHIL
D: We were gettin' worried about ya!
C: JUSTINE
D: Sorry.
C: BUBBA
D: Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this is Justine.
C: JUSTINE
D: Hi.
C: LIBERTA
D: Hi.
C: BUBBA
D: Congratulations, on your expectation.
C: JUSTINE
D: Thanks.
C: LIBERTA
D: Do you think it's a girl or a boy?
C: PHIL
D: Doesn't matter. As long as it plays quarterback for the Cowboys.
C: BUBBA
D: Well, I hear Senor Tuna callin'.
E: phone rings
C: PHIL
D: Hello. Yeah. Well, that's not right. What's that supposed to mean? Hey look. No. You don't know shit okay. Justine's pregnant. You got that? Well, look you better check your records again, pal, then call me! Some doctor says my sperm's no good. Does that mean Justine's not pregnant?
E: picks up the phone hangs up
C: BUBBA
D: No. That just means they got it wrong, is all. They don't know everything.
C: JUSTINE
D: They just got it wrong, so...
N: (Justine and Phil are in bed together.)
C: PHIL
D: Looks like that wind's pickin' up again.
N: (Justine is packing her things, she seems to be in a hurry. She drives down the street with her car and stops because of the red lights.)
C: JUSTINE
D: How it all came down to this, only the devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the corner on my left, the motel was down the road to my right. I closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future. On my left I saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and quiet whisperings. and burning secrets that won't ever die away. And on my right, what could I picture? The blue sky, the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, never ending nothing.
C: CHERYL
D: Hey Justine.
C: JUSTINE
D: I know where you can find him.
C: JACK
D: Holden?
C: JUSTINE
D: He's at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he'll be there till noon.
C: JACK
D: You done good. You're a good girl.
C: PHIL
D: Hey.
C: JUSTINE
D: Hey.
C: PHIL
D: What's going on in the bedroom? Looks like a twister hit it.
C: JUSTINE
D: Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry.
C: PHIL
D: I thought we were robbed. Why aren't you at work?
C: JUSTINE
D: They gave me the day off.
N: (TV reporter talking about Holden killing himself at the hotel)
C: PHIL
D: Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?
C: JUSTINE
D: No.
C: JACK
D: Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields, your store manager. As most of you all know by now, We lost another employee yesterday. Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man, and what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, like don't steal and don't be disturbed. The important is to move on. Like dozens of those who quit. This one's for you Holden.
C: CHERYL
D: I thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies....
C: JUSTINE
