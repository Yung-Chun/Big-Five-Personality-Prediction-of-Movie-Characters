M: OVER BLACK...
M: A distinctly SOUTHERN VOICE...
M: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
M: There's a moment of orderly silence
M: before a football play begins.
M: Players are in position, linemen
M: are frozen, and anything's
M: possible. Then, like a traffic
M: accident, stuff begins to randomly
M: collide. From the snap of the ball
M: to the snap of the first bone is
M: closer to four seconds than five.
S: EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT
N: We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the ball. As the play begins --
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the Redskins quarterback, takes the snap and hands off to his running back. JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann. The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: Two Mississippi. It's a trick play, a flea flicker, and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback. HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and to the side and Carson flies past.
E: CONT'D
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: Three Mississippi. Up to now the play's been defined by what the quarterback sees. It's about to be defined by what he doesn't. LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins lineman trying to block him.
E: CONT'D
N: The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses. Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann. The image FREEZES.
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player in the NFL and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie. The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes Theismann's body. PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating. TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.
E: CONT'D
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: He will also change the game of football as we know it. WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES.
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK GIFFORD
D: Again, we'll look at it with the reverse angle one more time. And I suggest if your stomach is weak you just don't watch.
E: V.0.
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: Joe Theissman never played another down of football.
N: TEAM PHOTO OF THE 2005 SEATTLE SEAHAWKS
C: LEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE
D: Now, y'all would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an NFL team is the quarterback. The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback.
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: And you'd be right. What you probably don't know is that more often than not the second highest paid player is, thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle. The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle.
E: CONT'D
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: Because, as every housewife knows, the first check you write is for the mortgage and the second is for the insurance. The left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side.
E: CONT'D
C: SERIES OF SHOTS
D: "Famous" left tackles - Jonathan Ogden, Orlando Pace, Andre Gurode. Then we SEE SHOTS of their hands, feet, waists, etc., corresponding with ---
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: The ideal left tackle is big, but a lot of people are big. He is wide in the butt and massive in the thighs. He has long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup.
S: EXT. WEST MEMPHIS -- DAY 5
N: A street anchored by project housing and littered with broken down cars and ne'er-do-wells. Lots of folks out, milling about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed. He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER.
C: LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
D: This is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that Monday night game and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that day he not only altered Joe Theismann's life, but mine as well. As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS --
C: INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE
D: Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?
E: V.O.
N: (NO RESPONSE) Mr. Oher?... MICHAEL (V.0.)
C: INVESTIGATOR'S.VOICE
D: Do you know, do you understand why I'm here?
E: V.O.
C: MICHAEL
D: To... investigate.
E: V.0.
C: INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE
D: Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate your odd... predicament.
E: V.0.
S: INT. NONDESCRIPT ROOM - DAY
N: Looks like a government office. Not much more than a desk on either side of which sit INVESTIGATOR GRANGER, an African- American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher. Michael slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees - a nervous trait of his.
C: GRANGER
D: Do you find it odd? Your predicament?
N: (NO RESPONSE) Michael?...
C: MICHAEL
D: Iono [I don't know]... Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more.
C: MICHAEL
D: Can I... can I leave now?
E: CONT'D
N: GRANGER (WITH FINALITY) No. You can't.
S: INT. ANCIENT FORD TAURUS _ DAY
C: SUPERSCRIPT: TWO YEARS BEFORE
D: Michael sits in the back seat, behind STEVEN HAMILTON, 14, and his father, BIG TONY, who drives.
N: Not a word is spoken as they drive through the streets of WEST MEMPHIS - poverty ridden.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: The Taurus exits into --
S: EXT. SOMEWHAT NICER AREA OF TOWN.- DAY
N: The Taurus passes an endless supply of churches and strip joints, all of which Michael's eyes take in.
S: EXT. EAST MEMPHIS - INT/EXT TAURUS - DAY (LATER)
N: We've gone from slums to nice neighborhoods - fathers and sons play baseball, kids tend lemonade stands, sprinklers keep the grass emerald green. Michael's face tells us he's never seen anything like this.
S: EXT. WINGATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL -- DAY
N: The Taurus enters the parking lot filled with nice cars.
S: A12 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY
N: Big Tony strides down the almost empty hallway, spots a door.
S: INT. WINGATE - COTTON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: BERT COTTON, football coach, cleans off his desk, ready to leave for the day. Big Tony knocks at the door.
C: BIG TONY
D: They say you the coach. Cotton eyes Tony, offers a hand.
N: COTTON Bert Cotton.
C: BIG TONY
D: Tony Hamilton, but everybody call me Big Tony.
C: COTTON
D: What can I do for you, Tony?
S: EXT. WINGATE - SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
N: Steven and Michael eye the freshly painted buildings, the flowers, the new playground jungle gyms and outdoor hoops.
C: STEVEN
D: Sure is pretty, huh, Big Mike? Mike doesn't answer, just takes it all in. Steven sees and opens a container filled to the brim with balls - footballs, basketballs, four square balls.
C: STEVEN
D: Not even locked!
E: CONT'D
C: MICHAEL
D: White people are crazy.
S: INT. WINGATE - COTTON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Big Tony and Cotton are mid-discussion ---
C: BIG TONY
D: You see I promised my mama Boo, on her deathbed, that I would get Steven outta public and into a church school.
C: COTTON
D: I appreciate that but I'm not involved with admissions.
C: BIG TONY
D: I figured I'd come to you; seeing as you might need some players.
C: COTTON
D: What sport does he play?
C: BIG TONY
D: Anything with a ball. Good, too. He has Cotton's attention for a moment, then it passes...
C: COTTON
D: Classes start in a week. It'd have to be for next semester.
C: BIG TONY
D: I know what you're thinking, Coach, but I got money. I'm a mechanic at Wilson's Auto t'other side of town.
N: (ANOTHER TRY) What if someone drops out or moves? Could they get in then?
C: COTTON
D: "They?" You only mentioned one son.
C: BIG TONY
D: Steven, yessir, but I brought another boy along.
C: COTTON
D: Another boy?
C: BIG TONY
D: Yeah, Big Mike. He stays on our couch sometimes. It's a bad deal. His mama's on the crack pipe and he ain't got nobody. He just wanted to come along with us today.
C: COTTON
D: Would... Big Mike be an applicant as well?
C: BIG TONY
D: Yeah, sure, why not. Cotton sighs, considers what to do.
C: COTTON
D: They'd have to fill out applications and make an appointment for interviews.
C: BIG TONY
D: I was hopin' you might just interview 'em now.
C: COTTON
D: They're here? Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven and Michael are playing one on one basketball.
C: BIG TONY
D: The little ones Steven and the big
N: ONE'S --
C: COTTON
D: Big Mike.
C: BIG TONY
D: Yeah. That's right.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: EXT. WINGATE - PLAYGROUND - DAY
N: For a boy his size Michael can really move. He dribbles, fakes left, then falls away, making a long three pointer. Cotton's eyes get a little wider as he watches -- Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop. Big men aren't supposed to move like this. Cotton's lips are almost quivering --
C: COTTON
D: Mother of God...
S: INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE BOARD ROOM - DAY
N: The Board of Admissions, eight or so men and women, are seated around a large conference table. By himself, at one end, sits Bert Cotton.
C: COTTON
D: Are there spots available or not? PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before...
C: SANDSTROM
D: Technically, yes, in both grades. But we have a greater responsibility than just filling classrooms. Steven Hamilton's paperwork looks acceptable and I believe he would be capable of succeeding here but the other kid -- Sandstrom looks through papers for the name.
C: COTTON
D: Big Mike.
C: SANDSTROM
D: Michael Oher gives us no reason to believe, based on his record, that he would be successful here.
C: COTTON
D: How bad could it be? Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file, which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out ---
C: MRS. SMITH
D: We're not sure exactly how old he is due to lack of records. He has a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th percentile. He's been enrolled in seven different institutions, including a gap of eighteen months around the age of ten when he apparently didn't attend school at all. He repeated first grade as well as second, there's no record of attendance in third, and in fourth grade --
C: COTTON
D: So they moved him ahead without going to third grade. That says something.
N: MRS. SMITH (IGNORING COTTON) His attendance records are abysmal and his grade point average begins with a zero. Zero-point-six- Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and science teacher, looks to the others.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Everyone passed him along - gave him D's so they could hand their problem off to the next school.
C: COTTON
D: Brave kid. For wanting to come here. For wanting a quality education. An education denied him by the poor quality of the schools he's attended. Most kids with his background wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place.
E: off their confusion
C: MRS. SMITH
D: Coach Cotton, we understand your interest in the young man's athletic abilities.
C: SANDSTROM
D: He wouldn't be able to play until he got his grades up anyway.
N: The Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 10
C: COTTON
D: Forget sports! Look at the wall. He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: "NEIGHBORLY,
N: ACADEMIC, CHRISTIAN".
C: COTTON
D: Christian. We either take that seriously or we paint over it. You don't admit Michael Oher for sports, you admit him because it's the right thing to do. Their faces announce that he's made a point.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. WINGATE - DAY
N: First day of class. Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue- eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with friends they haven't seen over the summer. Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the arch. Beneath the school name we read "WITH MEN THIS IS. POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE". Michael takes a deep breath and enters. He carries his "school bag" - a plastic grocery sack.
S: EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY
N: Just as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to the fact that he doesn't belong here. Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone.
S: INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY
N: It's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then...
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Class, this is Mike Oher and he's new here so I expect you all to make him feel welcome. Mike, take any empty seat.
E: with a warm smile
N: She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat. Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As students pass them back to others...
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: This is a quiz based on the information you learned last year in your science curriculum.
E: CONT'D
N: (OVER GROANS) Don't worry. It won't be graded. I just want to see how much of the information we need to hit again. Just answer whatever you know. The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and eyes the size of his feet. The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet like it's written in Greek. Mrs. Boswell watches him for a few seconds before turning back to her work.
S: INT. WINGATE - HALLWAY - DAY (LATER)
N: A bell RINGS and kids leave classrooms.
S: INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY
N: Michael sits alone while Mrs. Boswell collects the last of the papers. She walks over to Michael, looks down at his sheet. Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top. She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for --
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: It's okay.
C: MICHAEL
D: Can I leave now? She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances down at the sheet, turns it over and sees... A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a third grader drew it.
S: INT. BIG TONY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Michael lies on a tattered sofa. The lights are out but Michael's eyes are open, staring at the light emanating from beneath a closed bedroom door. We hear voices...
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Why he gotta always stay here?
E: O.S
C: BIG TONY'S VOICE
D: Ain't got nowhere else.
E: 0.S
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: And how's that your problem? You the Red Cross all of a sudden? Michael tries to shut his eyes.
E: O.S
S: 23 EXT. WINGATE - PARKING LOT - DAY
N: School is out. Steven walks up to Michael...
C: STEVEN
D: Hey, Big Mike, um... my Pops' girlfriend... she don't really want you to stay with us no more. Big Tony's Taurus pulls into the lot.
C: STEVEN
D: We can still give you rides if you want?
E: CONT'D
C: MICHAEL
D: Naw, it's aright. Steven gets in the Taurus. Michael watches it drive away.
S: 24 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM FOYER - NIGHT
N: A girl's volleyball game is in progress in the bg. As latecomers move en masse for entry into the gym, a small pretty lady on a cell phone moves.against the crowd; a salmon on a mission. This is LEIGH ANNE Tuohy. And she's pissed.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: I don't care if Patrick Ramsey did approve the chair. He's an NFL quarterback not Martha frickin' Stewart.
E: on cell phone
N: The Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 13 She arrives at the concession stand and waits impatiently.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: There's a difference between Bunny Williams and Lazee-boy.
E: CONT'D
N: (TO VENDOR) Three large popcorns and two large diets. (INTO CELL) When MTV Cribs comes to his house he'll be showing off his home theatre but all I'm gonna see is a brown Barca-lounger. I'm his designer, my name's on it. Deliver what I ordered!!! She hangs up angry, spots a friend nearby and her frown turns into a smile that could light up a cave.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Hi, sweetie! We're on the Kidspace committee together, aren't we?! It'll be a hoot!
E: CONT`D
S: INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT
N: Leigh Anne's husband SEAN TUOHY, handsome, confidant, and their 10-year-old son, SJ, sit, watching the game. During a time out, Sean eyes the crowd, sees something odd. In the upper corner of the gym sits Michael, by himself, rubbing his knees. Others around him, all white, have moved away. He's a very large island in the lily white gym.
C: SEAN
D: S.J., you know that kid?
C: SJ
D: What kid?
C: SEAN
D: Black kid. Up in the corner.
C: SI
D: Be goes to high school here. His name is Big something... Big Mike. Sean eyes Michael suspiciously.
C: SEAN
D: He look like a volleyball fan to you? Leigh Anne, loaded up with refreshments, makes her way up the stands to her family. She has a nod, a smile, a bon mot, for everyone she passes. As she sits...
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: What'd I miss?
C: SEAN
D: Collins got a dig.
C: SI
D: It's girl's volleyball, Mom. You didn't miss anything. Leigh Anne gives him a look then stands and shouts --
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Collins! Move your feet! ON THE COURT - COLLINS TUOHY, a beautiful 16-year-old, sighs and gives her mother a look - "Don't embarrass me!"
S: INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT (LATER)
N: The scoreboard tells us that the game is over. Fans file out. The Tuohy family waits in a group as the volleyball team exits the court.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Collins, we'll wait outside. And don't double condition in the shower - you still have homework!
C: COLLINS
D: I'm going over to Cannon's house to study.
C: SI
D: Can I go.to the Johnson's for dinner? They invited me.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: What's so awful about our house? Sean smiles, shakes his head as SJ and Collins leave.
N: Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael, alone, walking slowly, then bending down, picking something up, taking a few more steps and repeating the process. Picking up left-over bags of popcorn. Sean considers this for a second before leaving.
S: INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
N: Teachers drink stale coffee and chew on donuts.
C: FIRST TEACHER
D: Well, the big guy's been here a month and he ain't cutting it in my class.
E: BOB
C: SECOND TEACHER
D: Why would Admissions do this? It's not fair to us or the boy.
E: APRIL
C: THIRD TEACHER
D: Just setting him up to fail.
E: GLENDA
C: BOB
D: I don't think he has any idea what I'm teaching.
C: GLENDA
D: And how would you know if he did? He won't even talk. Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: He writes.
C: APRIL
D: His name. Barely. Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: He threw this in the trash can. "I look and I see white everywhere: white walls, white floors, and a lot of white people. The teachers do not know I have no idea of anything they are talking about. I do not want to listen to anyone, especially the teachers.
E: reads from the page
N: (MORE)
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: They are giving homework and expecting me to do the problems on my own. I have never done homework in my life. I go to the bathroom, look in the mirror and say, "This is not Michael Oher." He entitled it "White Walls." The room is dead quiet.
E: CONT'D a pause for effect
C: BOB
D: How's the spelling? Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves.
S: INT. WINGATE - CAFETERIA -- DAY
N: Sean and Coach Cotton sip coffee while all around them students eat their lunches. They are looking at Michael, who sits by himself without a tray in front of him.
C: COTTON
D: If he makes his grades he'll be eligible in the spring.
C: SEAN
D: If he makes his grades.
C: COTTON
D: But boy-hidey, just look at him. Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.
C: SEAN
D: What did you eat for lunch today?
C: MICHAEL
D: Here in the cafeteria.
C: SEAN
D: I didn't ask where you ate, I asked what you ate.
C: MICHAEL
D: A few things.
C: SEAN
D: Do you need some money? For lunch?
C: MICHAEL
D: I don't need any. Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton.
C: SEAN
D: Buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill. He's hungry.
E: off Cotton's look
C: COTTON
D: You could tell that by looking at him?
N: SEAN - I didn't grow up all that different from him. At public school they give you free lunch, Bert. And when food is finite, you'd be surprised how much time you can spend thinking about it..
S: INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY
N: Mrs. Boswell distributes a test to the class.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: You'll have one hour. If you finish early put it on my desk and sit quietly. She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a decision, rises and walks over.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Mike, come with me.
E: CONT`D
S: INT. WINGATE - SMALL ADJACENT ROOM - DAY
N: Filled with supplies and a small desk. Mrs. Boswell points and he sits.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: You can take the test back here away from everybody else. I'll sit
N: in there so if there's anything you don't understand you can ask. Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his hands on his knees and stares. Mrs. Boswell waits a beat then scoots her chair over next to him.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Mike, how about I ask the questions and you tell me the answers or as much as you know. She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads:
E: CONT'D
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Protozoans are classified based on: a) how they get their food, b) how they reproduce, c) how they move, or d) both a and c. Michael just stares. After a long moment
E: CONT'D
C: MICHAEL
D: Iono...
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Just try. Ask questions if you don't understand. But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face says she's about to give up when He lifts his eyes to her and points to -- -- the question on the test - specifically to the word "classified".
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: "Classified". It means how things are grouped together.
E: CONT'D
C: MICHAEL
D: Like our "class"?
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Exactly. This science course is classified based on what grade y'all are in. Eleventh. Michael nods understanding.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: Okay, Mike, you ready to answer the question?
E: CONT'D
N: He looks at her.
S: INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
N: Same group of teachers. Mrs. Boswell bursts through the door, holding the test.
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: He knows it!
C: BOB
D: Who knows it and what does he know?
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: The material. Michael Oher. I gave him this test verbally. She holds up the test -- marked with a large red "C".
C: APRIL
D: On how big a curve?
C: MRS. BOSWELL
D: He's been listening the whole time. It's amazing what he's absorbed. And, trust me, he's listening to you, too. Okay, so his reading level is low and he has no idea how to learn in a classroom, but... I'm not saying he's going to pass but Big Mike is not stupid.
E: makes her point
S: EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY
N: School is out and Michael walks among the kids of all shapes and sizes. Two little Kindergarten girls'try and swing themselves. Michael stops nearby, watching them.
C: MICHAEL
D: They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this "stranger". They jump off the swings and run away.
C: SI
D: Smile at 'em. Michael turns to see Si nearby, watching him.
E: OS
N: The Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 20
C: SJ
D: It lets them know you're their friend. Did you know that even little kids born blind smile? They've never seen anyone do it before but they smile anyway. So it's universal. That's why it works. Not that you should fake it or anything... You're Big Mike, right? Sean holds. out a fist for Mike to "knock" and the two walk toward the school entrance.
E: CONT'D
C: SJ
D: I'm Sean, but everyone calls me Si -- that's for Sean Junior because my father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy. He was a basketball star at Ole Miss, point guard, and now he owns like a million Taco Bells. Leigh Anne's car pulls up to the pick up/drop off and Si starts toward it.
E: CONT'D
C: SJ
D: Manana'. Michael smiles at the kid, who smiles back.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR - DAY
N: Leigh Anne notices Michael as she drives past him.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Who's that SJ?
C: SI
D: Big Mike.

D: Get your feet off my dash.
S: EXT. WINGATE - PICK UP/DROP OFF - DAY
N: Michael watches Leigh Anne's car disappear.
C: SANDSTROM
D: Big Mike?...
E: O.S.
N: Michael turns to see Paul Sandstrom, the principal.
S: EXT. WINGATE - DAY (A FEW MINUTES LATER)
N: Michael and Sandstrom sit on a bench.
C: SANDSTROM
D: Mike, I just got a call from someone at the police department. Do you remember the story in the papers awhile back about the man who fell off an overpass? No one knew who he was and they're not sure if he jumped, or if... at any rate he passed away. Sandstrom struggles with how to say the words.
E: off Michael's look Michael shakes his head
C: SANDSTROM
D: Mike, the man... was your father. Michael takes this in. without showing emotion.
E: CONT'D
C: SANDSTROM
D: They've been looking for someone to notify and came across your name on our registry. I'm really sorry, son.
E: CONT'D
N: (NO RESPONSE) Were you close? (Michael shakes his head) When did you last see him?
C: MICHAEL
D: Iono.
C: SANDSTROM
D: I'll try and find out where he's buried. Maybe we could go visit? Michael nods, then rises and walks away.
S: EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY (LATER)
N: Michael sits at a bus stop with his bag, rises as a bus stops in front of him. The Blind Side -- Yellow Draft - 04/15/09 22
S: INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT
N: Pretty seedy. Michael walks to a sink in the back, opens his plastic sack, pulls out an extra T-shirt and starts to wash it. A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he turns to look at her, she becomes quite nervous. She sets down the magazine and walks outside. It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she leaves he takes his wet T-shirt, wrings it-out, walks to her dryer and tosses the shirt inside to dry with her things.
S: EXT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT (LATER)
N: Michael sits in the corner, his head resting against the window, trying to sleep.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. WINGATE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
N: A banner over the arch reads: THANKSGIVING PAGEANT TONIGHT! Kids in costume - Pilgrims, Indians, turkeys - race out the door to greet their proud parents. Si, in an ornate headdress looks for and spots Sean and Leigh Anne waving. They walk away together toward the parking lot. 41-42 OMITTED 41-42
S: INT. SEAN'S BMW - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: As they exit the parking lot--
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Turn on the heat!
C: SEAN

D: Si, don't let this go to your head but I thought you were very convincing in the role of... uh...
C: SI

C: SEAN
D: Or maybe they just thought he'd make a better Chief.
C: SI
D: Dad, he's like Chinese.
C: LEIGH ANNE

C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Sean Junior! She opens the shades.

C: SEAN
D: SJ, Ole Miss is about to score!
C: SI
D: Which means they're about to fumble. They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food. Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch.
C: SEAN
D: Looks great, hon. Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned.
C: COLLINS
D: I see a lot of starch. SJ jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce - creating an easy to eat sandwich. He walks away.
N: Michael stares - he's never seen so much food. Leigh Anne hands him a plate. He gingerly puts a slice of.turkey on it.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: As much as you want.
N: (WALKS AWAY) Oh, the potato salad! With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his pants pocket and finishes filling his plate. Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room table, alone, not touching his plate. Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and playing games.

C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Heavenly Father. We thank you for all your many blessings on this family. We thank you for bringing us a new friend. And we ask that you look after. us in this holiday season and never let us forget just how very fortunate we are. Amen. A chorus of Amens and they all dig in.

D: Okay. Mike or Michael? Tell you what, from now on, to me, 'you're Michael. So,... Michael, where we headed?
E: off his shrug
S: EXT. HURT VILLAGE HOUSING PROJECT - DAY

D: Who's going to help you with your clothes?
N: MICHAEL (POINTED) Don't get out of the car. Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock before he closes the door. She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices several of the local ne'er-do-wells eyeing her. she locks the doors again, just for luck.
S: EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY

C: SALESMAN
D: Big and Tall. You need "Bigger and Taller". He walks away. She starts to pore through the small rack.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Anything you like?
N: (HE SHRUGS) The one thing I know about shopping is that if you don't absolutely love it in the store, you won't wear it. The store is where you like it best. (MORE)
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: And before you choose something think about yourself wearing it and ask yourself: Is this me?
E: CONT'D

C: ELAINE
D: It would certainly hurt your reputation to go there.
C: BETH
D: I'm actually from there but didn't mind hard work and look where I am now.
E: tongue in cheek
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Eating an eighteen dollar salad.
C: BETH

C: SHERRY
D: Such a shame.
C: BETH
D: Yes it is.

C: ELAINE
D: Did you know that black men were employed at a higher rate before those programs? It's a fact.
C: BETH
D: They're not "black", Elaine. The term du jour is African-American.
C: ELAINE
D: And what if they're from Jamaica, or like Bermuda.
C: SHERRY
D: Then they're BerMUDian-Americans. They all cringe and laugh.
C: ELAINE
D: So, why are you asking about the projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one of your charities?

D: Let's see...
E: CONT'D
C: MICHAEL
D: You don't have to help. I mean if you're busy or somethin'.
E: off Sean's. look
C: SEAN
D: I know. Think of a sentence like a football team. This is a noun here, see? That's like the team name or what they're known for - whether they're a running team or a passing team. And this is the verb. That's what makes 'em go - like a star player -- maybe a quarterback, maybe a running back. And this is an adjective - everybody oohs and ahs over adjectives but they're not as important as verbs.
E: points to page
C: SI
D: They're like wide receivers.
C: SEAN
D: Or kickers. Michael just stares at them.
C: SEAN

C: LEIGH ANNE
D: I mean, look at this, you've practically ruined a.ten thousand dollar couch. She moves closer to him. Her face softens.
E: CONT'D
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Do you want to stay here, Michael?
E: CONT'D

C: MRS. SMITH
D: "Protective instincts." Leigh Anne smiles and hands the file back.
C: MRS. SMITH
D: It's just so sad. Leigh Anne considers this, then...
E: CONT'D
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Yes, it is sad. So sad. But he either doesn't know it or doesn't think so and it's my job, and your job, to make sure he doesn't find out. Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for himself and I'll be damned if he starts to because of the way we treat him. "Darned."
E: off Mrs. Smith's look again off her look
S: INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

S: 96 EXT. WINGATE - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
N: Michael is lined up at defensive tackle. The offense breaks the huddle and Michael just stands there. He notices the other defensive linemen get in a stance and kind of squats a bit. When the ball is snapped he just holds his hands out, keeping the blocker from getting close to his body. The running back races right past him and into the secondary.

C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Don't pretend you didn't hear me.
C: SEAN
D: Shouldn't we at least talk about it?
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: What do you think we're doing? And don't act like I'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as his medical contact at school.
C: SEAN
D: There's a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone. Someone we barely know.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: And that's another thing. We have to find out more about his past.
C: SEAN
D: He won't talk about it. He's like an onion; you have to peel it a layer at a time.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Not if you use a knife. What if we sent him to a child psychologist?
C: SEAN
D: Do you really expect Big Mike --
N: LEIGH ANNE MICHAEL ---
C: SEAN
D: -- expect Michael to lie down and talk about his childhood like he's Woody Allen or something? Michael's gift is his ability to forget. He's mad at no one and doesn't really care what happened in the past. This puts her on her heels.
C: LEIGH'ANNE
D: You're right.
C: SEAN
D: (like he's never heard
C: THESE WORDS)

C: LEIGH ANNE
D: What is in there?
C: RONALD
D: A few case notes. This one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed Michael and six half-siblings from Denise Oher's care when Michael was seven. Quite a scene evidently. They had to split up the kids. And it's far from the worst.
E: holds one sheet up
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Where is she? His mother?
C: RONALD
D: Dunno, but if you find her we have a bunch more files we could add to.
N: (CONTINUED.)
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: How many children does she have?
C: RONALD
D: At least a dozen, probably more. With her drug arrest record my guess would be she can't even remember. Leigh Anne absorbs this.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: We'd need her permission though, .right?
C: RONALD
D: No. Michael is a ward of the state. Just apply and get a Judge to sign off on it.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: So you would give him away without even telling his mother? Ronald shrugs.

N: . 69 109 CONTINUED:
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: What do you mean?
C: DENISE OHER
D: He's a "runner". That's what the state called him after they took him from me. Every foster home they sent him to, he'd slip out the window at night and come looking for me. No matter where I was that boy would come find me, take care of me.
E: off her look

N: COTTON Board drill. Big Mike and Jay Collis. Best on best. An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs and lines up, one foot on either side of the board. Michael slowly moves into position opposite him. The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see. Leigh Anne is now right in the middle of them. Fulmer gives her a look that says,,"Who the hell are you?" Cotton blows his whistle, Michael fires out and it's over in an instant. Collis is pancaked under Michael, who gets up and offers a hand. The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle.
C: FULMER
D: Force equals mass times acceleration. Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and start poking digits and jabbering: "You won't believe it!" "You gotta see this!" "He's a freak of nature!" The Clemson coach strides away.
E: almost to himself
C: COTTON
D: Where are you going, Coach?
C: CLEMSON COACH
D: Back to South Carolina. I've seen more than enough. If he can qualify with his grades you tell Michael Oher that Clemson wants him.
C: FULMER
D: Good luck with that, Brad! Fulmer smiles wide then turns to look once more at Michael.
N: Leigh Anne watches him watch Michael.

E: off Sean's laugh
C: SEAN
D: So he goes to Junior College.
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: Most inner city kids that go to JC drop out in a year. His shot at the pros would go out the window.

D: I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.
C: MISS SUE
D: What's the situation with Michael?
C: LEIGH ANNE

C: MICHAEL
D: A brain.
C: MISS SUE
D: A brain. Full of knowledge - like a file cabinet with maps; shortcuts for figuring things out. You will learn this, Michael Oher because I'm here to help you use those maps and reach your destination. Like Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark.
C: MICHAEL
D: Sacagawea?
C: MISS SUE

E: off his nod he shakes his head
C: MISS SUE
D: When they find a body the police want to know how long they've been dead. The fine department at Tennessee helps them.

D: So they wouldn't be happy if you chose to play football there?
C: MICHAEL
D: No.
C: GRANGER
D: And your tutor...
C: MICHAEL
D: Miss Sue.
C: GRANGER
D: Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.
N: (MICHAEL NODS) Did Miss Sue try to persuade you to attend Ole Miss? (MICHAEL NODS) Did you know that the Tuohys make generous donations to Ole Miss? That even Miss Sue makes donations? That the:Tuohy's have a condo in Oxford so they can attend as many athletic events as possible? That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy are by our definition "boosters."
C: MICHAEL
D: What's that mean?
C: GRANGER
D: A booster is someone with an abnormal interest in a school's sports. Someone who-contributes financially to the University's athletic program. Michael doesn't answer, just keeps rubbing his knees. Then comes the part we've heard before...'
C: GRANGER
D: Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?

N: (MORE) GRANGER (CONT'D) (NO RESPONSE) Michael?...
C: MICHAEL
D: Iono... she sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more.
C: MICHAEL
D: Can I... can I leave now?
E: CONT'D
N: GRANGER (WITH FINALITY) No. You can't. Michael's building up anxiety by the second.
C: MICHAEL
D: What do you want, ma'am?
C: GRANGER
D: What I want, what my job is, is to discern whether something untoward occurred in your recruitment to Ole Miss.
C: MICHAEL
D: Unto...
C: GRANGER
D: I want the facts. I need the truth.
C: MICHAEL
D: I didn't lie...
C: GRANGER
D: And I want to know what you think about all this.
N: MICHAEL
C: THINK ABOUT WHAT?!
D: It's the first time we've ever heard Michael raise his voice. It echoes in the room. Granger lets it die before she leans forward and continues...
C: GRANGER
D: The NCAA fears that with your recruitment a door might be opened that boosters from lots of schools in the south will become legal guardians for young athletes without means and funnel them to their Alma Maters. Michael still doesn't get it, shakes his head.
C: GRANGER
D: I'm not saying I believe it and I'm not saying I don't, but there are many people involved with this case who would argue that the Tuohys took you in, fed you, clothed you, paid for your private education --
E: CONT'D
C: MICHAEL
D: No...no...no...
E: almost to himself
C: GRANGER
D: -- bought you a car and paid for a tutor all as part of a plan to insure that you played football for the University of Mississippi. Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long time then quickly stands and makes for the door.

D: Well, of course, but...
C: MICHAEL
D: Why did you do this for me?!
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: What?
C: MICHAEL
D: Everything! Was it for you or was it for me? Was it so I would go to school where you wanted?! Was it so I would do what you wanted?!
C: LEIGH ANNE
D: No, Michael...

D: You're the best person I know. Everything you do, you do for others.

D: Sean... what if he never comes back?

C: ALTON
D: Your Mama? Oh, I seen Dee Dee around. She usually stop by for a taste around this time. Tell you what, I'll get you a forty and we'll chop it up 'til she get here. Michael hesitates. Alton smiles, beckons.
S: INT. HURT VILLAGE - ALTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Shitty but with good electronics. There are maybe eight people in the apartment - partying, drinking, getting high. Michael steps inside. Alton points to a chair. A stoned out couple smokes on the adjacent couch. Next to them an INFANT cries in a broken down crib. In the other corner of the room sits David, the young man we met before. Michael nods and David nods back. Alton hands Michael a beer.
C: ALTON
D: It's good to see you, Big Mike. You lookin' fit. I heard you playin' some ball.
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah.
C: ALTON
D: But you know that rich kid football ain't like the public school league. People packing knives in their socks. Back in the day I was a quarterback. You knew that, right? At MLK.
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah, I heard.
N: (TO DAVID) You still playing ball over at the JC?
C: DAVID
D: Naw.
C: ALTON
D: He with me now! I'll open a spot for you, too.
C: DAVID
D: Got tired of going to class. Always somebody tellin' me what to do.
C: ALTON
D: Turn it up, bitch! David jumps up and cranks the volume on a RAP SONG until the beat is bouncing off the walls. Michael sips the beer; rubs his knees.

E: CONT'D

N: SWEETLITTLE -- Michael shoves him hard. Alton unprepared for the force, flies back against the wall. On the ground he reaches in his belt for his gun, but just as he gets it out -- Michael slaps it away. He picks up Alton and throws him across the room. The party comes unhinged as Michael grabs Alton, holds him against the wall with one hand while pounding him with the other. Blood flies from Alton's face - eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds. TWO OTHER GUYS grab Michael from behind and one -- STICKS A GUN IN MICHAEL'S TEMPLE Michael screams like a banshee, spins, grabs them and tackles them over the couch. An errant round FIRES into the ceiling. A table flies and the crib smashes. Michael looks to David, frozen in the corner, then over to the SCREAMING child on the floor. He grabs his head and heaves, trying to make it all stop - the music, the screams, the crying. The shots PULSE to the

D: When I was little and something awful was happening, my Mama would tell me to close my eyes.
N: (MORE) 125'
C: MICHAEL
D: She was tryin' to keep me from seeing her do drugs or other bad things. And she'd say, "keep 'em closed till I say so." And then when she was finished or the bad things were over she'd say, "now when I count to three, you open your eyes and the past is gone, the world is a good place, and it's all gonna be okay."
E: CONT'D
C: LEIGH ANNE

C: LEIGH ANNE

D: She's an onion, Michael. You have to peel her one layer at a time. Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window. She rolls it down, dabbing tears from her eyes.
