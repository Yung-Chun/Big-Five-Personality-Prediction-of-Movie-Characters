M: "LIVING IN OBLIVION"
M: Screenplay by
M: Tom DiCillo
M: SHOOTING DRAFT
N: A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, glass full moon. Fade to BLACK. Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.
S: EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT
N: A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness of night. In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie- talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts.
C: BERT
D: What time is it?
C: CYBIL
D: Four. Why?
C: BERT
D: This milk is bad.
C: CYBIL
D: When did you buy it?
E: sniffs
C: BERT
D: Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?
C: CYBIL
D: Monday. There's a deli on Broadway.
E: pause
C: BERT
D: Nothing closer?
C: CYBIL
D: Nothing that's open.
C: BERT
D: Is it that bad?
E: sniffs the milk
C: CYBIL
D: I don't know. You're the one who said it was bad.
N: At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.
S: EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT. B/W
N: Amid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black leather half-fingered gloves.
C: WOLF
D: This is the worst fucking coffee I've had in my life.
C: CYBIL
D: Then don't drink it.
C: GAFFER
D: What're we doing today?
C: WOLF
D: "Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks to Mom."
E: pulls out a wrinkled callsheet
C: AC
D: Any nudity?
C: CYBIL
D: Yeah, you have to take your fucking pants off.
C: AC
D: I'll do it. I like Ellen.
C: GAFFER
D: Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse in that Richard Gere movie.
C: BERT
D: I worked on that.
C: AC
D: The shower scene.
C: WOLF
D: Start with the 5K in the window. Run feeders for three blonds into the living room.
C: GAFFER
D: Two people. Sitting? Standing?
C: WOLF
D: Who fuckin' knows?
C: GAFFER
D: "Ellen talks to Mom."
E: walks off
S: INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W
N: NICOLE sits quietly in the back seat of a beat-up station wagon. She glances out at the empty city moving past her window and lets out a deep sigh. JEFF, the young intern assigned as her driver, glances into the rearview mirror.
C: JEFF
D: Tired?
C: NICOLE
D: No, I've been up since four. I've got a big scene today and I'm kind of nervous.
C: JEFF
D: "Ellen talks to Mom."
C: NICOLE
D: Have you read the script?
C: JEFF
D: No. It's on the callsheet.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I tell my mother I never felt she really loved me.
C: JEFF
D: You're going to yell at each other?
C: NICOLE
D: I don't know. I'm just going to go with how I feel. Which is the scary part. I'm very close to this character.
C: JEFF
D: Problems with your own mom?
C: NICOLE
D: Yes. But she died before I, well before we could reconcile...
C: JEFF
D: You were great in that Richard Gere movie.
C: NICOLE
D: Thanks.
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL. NIGHT. B/W
N: CU sidewalk. A pair of women's orthopedic shoes enter the frame and begin pacing. Camera pans up to reveal CORA, a small woman in her early 60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel. She appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself.
C: CORA
D: Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO memory of this whatsoever.
N: Jeff pulls the car up to the curb and Cora gets into the back seat.
S: INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W
C: NICOLE
D: Good morning, "Mom."
C: CORA
D: Morning.
E: gruff
C: NICOLE
D: Sleep well?
C: CORA
D: Not a wink.
N: Cora immediately lights a cigarette. Nicole instinctively wrinkles her nose and turns away. Cora notices this and makes an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from Nicole by blowing it hard out the side of her mouth. Jeff glances back at the two women in the rearview mirror. No one speaks.
S: INT. SET. DAWN. B/W
N: NICK -- the Director, WOLF -- the Cameraman and WANDA -- the AD, stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set. All are holding coffee cups. The Gaffer can be seen in the background fumbling with a light.
C: NICK
D: Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda. I'm just saying we left last night and I knew we didn't get that scene.
C: WANDA
D: I'm sorry, I thought it was a great scene, Nick.
C: NICK
D: It was OK; and it's going to be alright. But I'm not settling for OK today. This is a big scene and I'm not leaving till we get it.
C: WANDA
D: Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here for you.
C: NICK
D: Alright, here's what I'm thinking. Wolf, I want to do the whole scene in one shot.
C: WOLF
D: It's been done.
C: NICK
D: I know that but I'd like to try it anyway.
C: WOLF
D: Handheld.
C: NICK
D: No, dolly. We go from Close-up to Wide-shot and back to Close-up in the same shot.
C: WOLF
D: I'll use the 35, minimize distortion; I'll light it all from the ceiling. It could be kind of great.
C: WANDA
D: Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: I'll need to see a couple run- throughs.
C: NICK
D: Not too many. It's a tough scene for the actors. I want them to feel relaxed, fresh...
C: WANDA
D: We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an hour, 45?
C: WOLF
D: I don't know how you drink that shit black, Nick. I got to dump in the milk. It's the only way I can cut the taste.
N: Suddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with harsh, blinding light.
C: NICK
D: Jesus!
C: WOLF
D: What the fuck?!
C: WANDA
D: Flame on, asshole!!
N: The screen goes completely WHITE.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
N: Screen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting; it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely registers it. WS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. Two flats have been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner. A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the rather scrawny looking set. Most of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through the camera.
C: WANDA
D: OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the work. Lock it up. Going for picture.
N: Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.
C: NICK
D: OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing fine. Remember, really listen and really answer. I've got nothing to say to you. Just let it happen. It's all there.
E: smiles at Nicole
C: WANDA
D: Ready, Nick?
C: WOLF
D: Look at this a second, Nick.
N: Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually and emotionally breathtaking.
C: WOLF
D: I pushed in a foot. She's incredible. It's coming right through the lens.
N: Nick grips Wolf's shoulder in gratitude.
C: NICK
D: That's great, man. Beautiful.
C: WANDA
D: Ready, Nick?
C: NICK
D: Let's go. Right away.
C: WANDA
D: And, roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: And, roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take one.
E: hits the sticks
C: NICK
D: Action.
S: INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 1. COLOR
N: From the moment Nick calls "action" the film will cut directly to the shot the set camera is filming. The shot is fluid, graceful and in richly, beautiful COLOR. Nicole's performance is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness.
C: NICOLE
D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
C: CORA
D: Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
C: NICOLE
D: You were just standing there looking at me. Then you pulled me up and said, "You're not hurt." Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again.
C: CORA
D: I was worried about Danny.
C: NICOLE
D: You do remember.
C: CORA
D: He was smaller than you.
N: Nicole turns to Cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an abandoned child. Nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe.
C: NICOLE
D: You were so worried about Danny --
N: Suddenly the BOOM dips all the way into the shot.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
C: WOLF
D: Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut. Les, your boom was all the way in the shot.
C: BOOM
D: Well, where's the frame line?
N: All the crew move around, all talking at once.
C: WANDA
D: OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it down. We're going again right away. Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame line?
C: BOOM
D: I guess so.
C: WANDA
D: OK, here we go. Right away. Picture's up.
N: Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.
C: NICK
D: Beautiful; both of you. Stay focused. Stay with it. No big deal. Let's go, Wanda. Right away.
C: WANDA
D: Roll sound!

C: NICOLE
D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
C: CORA
D: Ellen, I --
N: The image suddenly goes out of focus.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
C: AC
D: I'm sorry, I have to cut. I was completely off on the focus. It's my fault, I'm sorry.
C: WANDA
D: Thanks for the apology but you'll never work in this town again.
E: laughter
C: AC
D: I've got it now.
C: WANDA

E: hits the sticks
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 3. COLOR
N: The scene begins once again. Remarkably, Nicole's enormous commitment is just as full and sharp. Nick is in ecstasy.
C: NICOLE
D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
C: CORA
D: Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
N: Suddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap song blasting out of its trunk-mounted speakers.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
C: SOUND
D: Street noise!
C: WANDA
D: That's a cut! What the fuck's going on down there!? You call that a lock-up!? Get that car out of there!
E: into her walkie
C: NICK
D: Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy just get a flatbed trailer with about 600 speakers on it and tow it behind his car.
N: Everyone nods in annoyed agreement; everyone except the Boom man who appears to be following the music with the mike, bopping to it through the headphones. Slowly, interminably, the music fades off into the distance.
C: SOUND
D: And... it's clear.
C: WANDA
D: Do I have a lock-up?
E: into her walkie
C: WALKIE
D: kkkkkssst... sttttss yes.
E: V.O.
C: WANDA
D: Is that a real lock-up?
C: WALKIE

D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
C: CORA
D: Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
C: NICOLE
D: You were just standing there looking at me. Then you pulled --
N: Suddenly the BOOM drops into frame again.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
C: WOLF
D: Boom's in.
C: NICK
D: Jesus Christ.
C: BOOM
D: Where?
C: WOLF
D: The whole left side of frame, Les.
C: WANDA
D: Alright, can we please get a motherfucking frame line please?!
C: BOOM
D: The frame keeps changing.
C: WOLF
D: That's the idea, Les.
C: SOUND
D: May I make a suggestion? Is it possible to maybe break the shot down? Maybe two shots instead? Might make it easier for Les.
C: NICK
D: No.
C: SOUND
D: Then I need ten minutes to switch to radio mikes.
C: WANDA
D: Your call, Nick.
C: NICK
D: There won't be any other sound problems?
C: SOUND
D: No more boom problems.
C: NICK
D: Switch to radios.
C: WANDA
D: That's a ten-minute break. Release the lock-up. Stand by.
C: WOLF
D: Get me a coffee. Half milk.
E: to the AC
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
N: Nick looks for Nicole but sees only Cora standing by the couch. Les has both arms up the back of her dress, running the wire to her radio mike. She's wearing stockings rolled down to just above her knees. Nick turns and spots Nicole by herself in a dark corner of the set and walks over to her.
S: INT. SET APT. A CORNER. DAY. B/W
C: NICK
D: I'm sorry about all this, Nicole.
C: NICOLE
D: It's not your fault, Nick. Is there a way to use some of the earlier takes?
C: NICK
D: Not unless I change the shot; do a cutaway of Cora or something and intercut the takes. I don't want to do that. It's a really nice shot and what you're doing is incredible.
C: NICOLE
D: Thanks, Nick.
C: NICK
D: The radio mikes are going to make everything easier. So, look. Take a moment. Let all this shit go. We don't roll till you're ready.
C: NICOLE
D: OK.
N: Nick moves back to the set, leaving Nicole in the shadows. Camera stays on her as she begins emotionally preparing herself once again.
C: SCRIPT
D: How was she in that Richard Gere movie?
E: V.O.
C: CYBIL
D: So-so.
E: V.O.
N: Camera slips halfway through an open bedroom door, holding Nicole on one side of the frame while revealing PAM the Script Supervisor and CYBIL sitting on the floor smoking. Though separated by the wall, Nicole hears everything the two women say.
C: SCRIPT
D: Her career really took off, didn't it?
C: CYBIL
D: I saw her in a Michael Bolton video.
C: SCRIPT
D: She is nice; but I could do a better job.
N: Camera slips into a CU of Nicole. She closes her eyes as the two women continue talking about her. Screen goes BLACK.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
N: A BLACK scrim, held by the Gaffer, passes in front of the camera, revealing the set with Nicole and Cora settling in for a take.
C: WANDA
D: Where's that flag going?
C: GAFFER
D: It's a scrim.
C: WANDA
D: Wolf!
C: WOLF
D: Two seconds, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: No. No more tweaking. Picture's up. Lock it up!
E: into her walkie
N: Wolf quickly motions Gaffer to hand-hold the scrim in front of the 5K.
C: WANDA
D: And, roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!

S: INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 5. COLOR
N: Once again the scene begins. Nicole shows the first signs of losing her concentration.
C: NICOLE
D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
C: CORA
D: Ellen, I have no memory --
N: Suddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION sending bits of glass flying through the frame. Cora jumps, clutching her chest.
C: CORA
D: Oh, God!
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
N: CU the light the Gaffer had been holding the scrim before. It is smoking and shattered.
C: NICK
D: Jesus fucking Christ!
C: WOLF
D: Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug. Right there by your foot.
E: to the Gaffer
C: WANDA
D: That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora, are you alright?
N: Cora nods wordlessly, gasping for breath.
C: WANDA
D: Props. Props! Let's get a broom up here right away. Clear the set!
S: INT. APT. HALLWAY. DAY. B/W
N: Nick, Cora, and Nicole stand in a corner of the landing. Nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood.
C: NICK
D: Well, let's see. What do you think is going to happen next, Cora?
C: CORA
D: I'm going to have a heart attack!
C: NICK
D: No, you're not. You're going in there in two minutes and we are really going to nail this scene. I know it. I have no doubt about it. Nicole...
N: Nick turns to Nicole and stops in midsentence. He looks at her for a long moment. Nicole returns his gaze then suddenly looks away.
C: WANDA
D: Nick! Nick!
E: V.O.
C: NICK
D: One second!
N: Nick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set.
C: CORA
D: I'll tell you this much right now; I am never, ever doing another fucking low-budget movie.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
N: Nick joins Wanda and Wolf on the set couch and chair.
C: NICK
D: What's up?
C: WANDA
D: Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's losing it a little bit. You got three quarters of the scene really, really incredible in the first take. Do a quick cut-away and all you need is a pickup of the last part of the scene.
C: NICK
D: Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: You know how I feel; I love this shot. Hell, I designed it.
C: NICK
D: Then let's just stick with the game plan, OK? It's a simple shot. We're going to get it this time, I feel it.
C: WANDA
D: We're here for you, Nick. Whatever it takes.
N: Nick moves off. Wanda stares at Wolf who studiously inspects his light meter.
C: WANDA
D: Thanks.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
N: Camera is close on the black-and-white clapboard. Nicole's face can be partially seen behind it.

S: INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 6. COLOR
N: As the scene begins again, it is obvious that both actresses are completely distracted. Nick's face betrays a rapidly increasing anxiety.
C: NICOLE
D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
C: CORA
D: I...
N: There is a long awkward pause as Cora realizes she can't remember her line.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
C: NICK
D: Cut. That's OK, Cora. What's the line? Just say it to me; no acting.
C: CORA I...
E: pause
C: AC
D: "Ellen, I have no memory of this line whatsoever."
N: Amid general tittering from the crew, Wanda yells out.
C: WANDA
D: OK, could we get the line please?! Script!

N: The scene begins again. Nicole is lifeless; she's merely saying the lines.
C: NICOLE
D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway --
C: CORA
D: I was worried about Danny!
N: Nicole stops cold, completely thrown by Cora jumping her line.
C: NICOLE
D: I'm sorry, I'm lost...
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
C: NICK
D: Cut. It's OK. No big deal.
N: Nick's voice has the rigid tremble of someone barely able to keep from screaming.
C: NICK
D: Everyone relax. We're just going to run the lines. That's all. No acting. Just run the lines. Then we're going to shoot this fucking scene.
S: INT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W
N: Nicole gets up quietly and sits next to Cora on the couch, wordlessly taking her hand in hers.
C: CORA
D: I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up for you.
E: whispers
C: NICOLE
D: Cora, don't even think that. You're doing great. I'm the one who's fucking it up. If I get through this I swear I'm never acting again.
E: whispers
N: She means it. Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's face. On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand of Nicole's hair from her eyes. A sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole. The living room grows strangely quiet.
C: NICK
D: And, action on the run-through.
E: faintly, from a distance
N: CU Nicole. She looks quickly toward Nick in confusion.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY. COLOR
N: DISSOLVE to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out the open door of the hospital room. CU Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. Still confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance, and farewell. It is identical to the one we have just seen Cora make to her.
C: NICK
D: And action on the run-through.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
N: WS, the Living Room Set. Nick, Wanda, the rest of the crew standing quietly. Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. The run-through begins. From the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there has been a remarkable change in her. Every word now has the stunning clarity of truth. Cora is completely engulfed in the moment.
C: NICOLE
D: Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
C: CORA
D: Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
C: NICOLE
D: You were just standing there looking at me.
N: As Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this exquisite moment happening before them. Nick's face is lit with rapture.
C: NICK
D: Roll camera... roll camera.
E: whispering
N: He glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind the camera. He whispers frantically to the AC.
C: NICK
D: Where's Wolf?
C: AC
D: In the bathroom... he doesn't feel good.
E: whispers
C: NICK
D: Get him! Get him!
E: whispers
N: Nick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in agony.
C: NICOLE
D: Then you pulled me up and said, "You're not hurt." Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again.
C: CORA
D: I was worried about Danny.
C: NICOLE
D: You do remember.
C: CORA
D: He was smaller than you.
C: NICOLE
D: You were so worried about Danny. What about me, Mom? Why weren't you worried about me?
N: There is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. Nicole and Cora are in each other's arms. Pam and Cybil share a piece of tissue. CUT TO: an extreme CU of Nick.
C: NICK
D: Where the fuck is Wolf?!!!
S: INT. BATHROOM. DAY. B/W
N: In the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom, Wolf pukes violently into the toilet. His face is pale and slick with perspiration. His eyes look upward toward the sound of Nick yelling.
C: WOLF
D: One second!
N: Wolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches him back toward the toilet bowl.
S: INT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W
N: The set is quiet, subdued. Nick sits on the couch with Nicole and Cora. Wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the sweat from his face. Wanda addresses the crew.
C: WANDA
D: OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the milk downstairs. OK? It appears to be bad.
N: Nick speaks uneasily to Nicole and Cora. He is a wreck and his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely demented.
C: NICK
D: I've had to, well I've changed the shot; we're just a little pressed for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen for the last part of the scene, starting with Cora's "I was worried about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to cut this into the fourth take. We almost had it. That was unbelievable, both of you. But let's not think about it. That moment is gone, and... we'll, we'll get another one. I have no doubt about it. OK? Here we go.
N: Nick walks over and stands beside the camera.
S: INT. SET APT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY. B/W
C: WOLF
D: I'm ready, Nick.
N: Nick is so angry he can't even look at Wolf.
C: NICK
D: Call it, Wanda.

D: And, roll sound.

S: INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: PICKUP 1. COLOR
N: The scene begins at the pickup point. Miraculously, both Cora and Nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they were in the run-through.
C: CORA
D: I was worried about Danny.
C: NICOLE
D: You do remember.
C: CORA
D: He was smaller than you.
C: NICOLE
D: You were so worried about Danny. What about me, Mom? Why weren't --
N: In the middle of this final, delicate moment an insistent electronic beeping is heard.
S: INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W
C: NICK
D: CUT!!!!
C: WANDA
D: What the fuck is that?! Sound?
C: SOUND
D: It's not me.
E: frantically checking his equipment
C: BOOM
D: It's the camera.
C: WOLF
D: The fuck it is. It's off; it's not even running.
N: The beep continues, growing louder.
C: WANDA
D: What's going on down there?! Do I have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't hear a beeping sound? The street's quiet.
E: into her walkie to Nick
C: NICK
D: Then what the fuck is it!!?
C: AC
D: It's somebody's watch!
N: Everybody holds their watches up to their ears.
C: WOLF
D: Not mine.
C: WANDA
D: Not mine.
C: SOUND
D: Not mine.
C: BOOM
D: Not mine.
N: And so on, until all watches have been checked with negative results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder. Suddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set, ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, heaving them against the wall with a startling violence.
C: NICK
D: Where is it!! You motherfucker! You cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! Where the fuck are you!? Where!! Where!!
N: Everyone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open- mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage.
C: NICK
D: Can someone help me please?! Do I have to do everything myself here?!
N: Nick loses it completely.
C: NICK
D: Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you finally going to pay attention here?! Hey, focus puller, you want to make a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got some great fuckin' Thai Stick here! Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker! I saw your reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors! Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky motherfucker! What is your name!? What do you fucking do around here?! Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't even find a teeny fucking beep?!
E: to the Gaffer to Cybil to the Soundman
N: CU of Nicole. She turns away, unable to watch anymore. The beeping continues.
C: NICK
D: See what I have to put up with, Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do some of that magic on camera!? But no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!"
N: WS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the silent set. Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished set and lets out a long, wrenching scream.
S: INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. COLOR
N: QUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open. The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The beeping finally stops. Nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat and still breathing heavily.
C: NICK
D: God...
E: this is not a sigh of relief
N: The camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS. Out of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in COLOR except where specifically indicated to be Black and White.
S: INT. WANDA'S APT. DAWN
N: She is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy boots. She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots. The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads 4:13 A.M.
C: WOLF
D: Well, when did he ask you?
C: WANDA
D: Yesterday, when I was helping him check into his hotel.
C: WOLF
D: What, the guy can't even check into a hotel by himself?
C: WANDA
D: Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all. If being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then I'm happy to do it.
C: WOLF
D: Well, how did it come up?
C: WANDA
D: He asked me if I liked jazz, I said yes, and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club.
C: WOLF
D: I like jazz.
C: WANDA
D: He did not invite you.
E: applies perfume
C: WOLF
D: Why are you wearing perfume to work?
C: WANDA
D: Because I feel like it.
C: WOLF
D: You didn't wear it yesterday.
C: WANDA
D: Oh, stop it. You're acting like a child.
N: Wanda playfully swipes at Wolf's face with a negligee she is returning to the closet. It misses him completely.
C: WOLF
D: My eye!
C: WANDA
D: Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright?
C: WOLF
D: Do I look alright?!
C: WANDA
D: Let me see. Christ, we're going to be late.
N: Wanda sits and perfunctorily examines Wolf's eye.
S: INT. CAR. DAWN
N: The car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel. JEFF, the Intern and NICK, the Director, sit quietly in the motionless car.
C: NICK
D: Should we call up to the room again?
C: JEFF
D: He said he'd be right down.
N: Nick lets out a huge yawn.
C: JEFF
D: Tired?
C: NICK
D: I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the set all night. I was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong.
C: JEFF
D: That's an anxiety dream. Are you anxious about something?
C: NICK
D: I don't know. Sometimes I wonder what the hell I'm doing in this business. It's all just one compromise and disappointment after another. I don't know if I have the personality for it.
C: JEFF
D: Sounds kind of like an identity crisis.
C: NICK
D: Maybe you're right. Who am I? What am I really capable of? Maybe I should just get a job teaching at a women's college somewhere.
C: JEFF
D: How'd you get into cinematography?
C: NICK
D: I'm not a cinematographer.
C: JEFF
D: You're not?
C: NICK
D: No. I'm directing this movie.
C: JEFF
D: How'd you get into directing?
E: pause
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN
N: In the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom.
C: PALOMINO
D: They're waiting downstairs.
C: WOMAN
D: Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.
C: PALOMINO
D: Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell you, I had a lot of fun last night, really, but for me, where I'm at right now in my life, a relationship is...
C: WOMAN
D: Chad; hold it. This was a one-time deal. You know it, I know it. There is no need for melodrama.
C: PALOMINO
D: I just thought you might...
C: WOMAN
D: Look, all I ask is that you don't mention this to anyone.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, that's not my style.
C: WOMAN
D: Good.
C: PALOMINO
D: So, I'll see you on the set.
N: Palomino slips out the door. The woman falls back onto the bed, turning her face toward the camera. We see it is NICOLE.
C: NICOLE
D: God damn it.
N: She lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower. The bedside clock reads 4:30 A.M.
S: INT. CAR. DAWN
N: The car pulls up outside a NYC apt building. Jeff, Nick, and Palomino sit inside.
C: PALOMINO
D: I got two films coming up right after yours, Nick. One I play a rapist that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with. The other I'm kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder.
C: NICK
D: That's great, man.
C: PALOMINO
D: Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess twinkie shit, Nick.
C: NICK
D: Hostess twinkie?
C: PALOMINO
D: That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff, man. These are the kind of movies I want to do, right here.
C: NICK
D: I'm glad you feel that way, Chad. And I just want to tell you, I'm really happy we can work together.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, me too! You're a great director, man. Your films are wacked! And I'm gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick. I'm gonna pick your brain.
C: NICK
D: Good. Then you can pick my nose.
C: PALOMINO
D: See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey, what are we sitting here for?
E: big laugh
C: NICK
D: We're waiting for Nicole.
C: PALOMINO
D: Nicole? She's takin' a tax --
E: he stops
C: NICK
D: What?
C: PALOMINO
D: Probably taking a shower or something. Hey, how was her shower scene in that Richard Gere movie?
C: NICK
D: Good.
C: JEFF
D: Really great.
N: The three men sit in silence. WS, showing the car parked outside Nicole's apt, the men inside waiting.
S: INT. THE SET. MORNING
N: A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks for a long moment.
C: GAFFER
D: I think we got nudity today.
C: AC
D: It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and Damian kiss."
E: reads from his callsheet
C: GAFFER
D: Could be a kiss with nudity.
C: AC
D: I like Ellen. She's my type.
C: GAFFER
D: Why is that?
C: AC
D: She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.
C: GAFFER
D: Maybe I'll give her a part. That's right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty soon.
C: AC
D: Oh yeah?
C: GAFFER
D: Yup. Feature. I brought my script.
N: The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered SCRIPT, folded lengthwise, out of his back pocket.
C: GAFFER
D: Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm going to give it to him right during lunch. Maybe right after.
C: AC
D: Alright.
C: GAFFER
D: Got to be aggressive. You want to shoot it?
C: AC
D: Sure.
C: GAFFER
D: You ever shot anything?
C: AC
D: No.
C: GAFFER
D: That's alright; got to start somewhere.
N: Suddenly the Gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the AC's hand.
S: INT. MAKEUP CORNER. DAY
N: Nicole sits before the makeup mirror. LORDE, the male Makeup artist picks up a tube of Preparation H and begins applying it under Nicole's eyes just as Nick walks up.
C: NICK
D: Jesus, what are you doing?
C: LORDE
D: Shrinking tissue. That's what this stuff is for. Let that sit for two minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back.
C: NICK
D: How'd you get here?
C: NICOLE
D: Took a taxi.
C: NICK
D: Oh. We've been waiting in front of your apartment for half an hour.
C: NICOLE
D: God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I feel like such an asshole.
C: NICK
D: You're just saying that because you have Preparation H on your face.
C: NICOLE
D: I never should have gone out last night. I hate jazz. God, I look terrible.
C: NICK
D: No you don't.
C: NICOLE
D: Don't bullshit me, Nick.
C: NICK
D: I'm not. You really look beautiful.
N: Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him. He looks away quickly. The moment is awkward, as if they both realize he has inadvertently revealed something. Just then Palomino approaches.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?
C: NICOLE
D: I took a cab.
C: PALOMINO
D: Oh, cause we were wondering how you got here.
N: Nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence.
C: NICK
D: Alright, good; everybody's here. We'll do a run-through as soon as you guys are ready.
C: PALOMINO
D: You got it, Chief.
N: Lorde reenters as Nick leaves. Palomino sits in the chair beside Nicole and Lorde immediately begins his makeup. No one speaks.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: The crew is assembled behind the camera. Wolf is now wearing a black eyepatch over one eye. Nick is on the set, talking with Nicole and Palomino. Palomino wears a tuxedo and Nicole is in an elaborate low-cut gown.
C: WANDA
D: Hold it down, hold it down, people. Actors working.
C: PALOMINO
D: Great shirt, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Why, thank you, Chad.
E: big smile
C: NICK
D: OK, let's work out the rest of this blocking. Wolf -- What happened to your eye?
E: notices Wolf's eyepatch
C: WOLF
D: A little accident.
C: NICK
D: You going to be alright?
C: WOLF
D: I think so.
C: PALOMINO
D: It looks good on you, man.
C: NICK
D: Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're there by the chair. Camera is close on Ellen: her first line.
C: NICOLE
D: I've always admired you from afar.
C: PALOMINO
D: Admired? That sounds rather professional.
C: NICK
D: Good! "Professional," that's the cue; Damian steps up to the bed. Camera pulls back. The scene continues.
C: NICOLE
D: Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
C: PALOMINO
D: It sounds like the champagne talking.
C: NICOLE
D: I've loved you from the moment we met.
C: PALOMINO
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: NICOLE
D: We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere.
C: PALOMINO
D: God. And all this time I thought...
C: NICK
D: Then the kiss. How's that feel?
C: PALOMINO
D: Great.
C: NICK
D: Nicole?
C: NICOLE
D: Good.
C: NICK
D: Wolf, any thoughts?
C: WOLF
D: Nope.
C: PALOMINO
D: I've got a thought. What about Damian having an eyepatch like Wolf's?
C: NICK
D: Let me think about that one, Chad.
C: PALOMINO
D: OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve, Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take One. Let's shoot it!
C: NICK
D: One second, Chad. You ready for one, Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: Hell, I been ready.
C: PALOMINO
D: Alright, Wolfman.
C: NICK
D: Good. Call it, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take one!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE SET. TAKE ONE
N: Instantly the film cuts from color to B/W. Chad and Nicole begin their Love Scene.
C: NICOLE
D: I've always admired you from afar.
C: PALOMINO
D: Admired? That sounds rather professional.
N: The camera starts to dolly, however Chad does not move. He goes out of frame forcing Wolf to pan abruptly to Nicole.
C: NICOLE
D: Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
C: PALOMINO
D: It sounds like the champagne talking.
C: NICOLE
D: I've loved you from the moment we met.
C: PALOMINO
D: Why didn't you tell me?
E: finally moves to his mark
C: NICOLE
D: We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere.
C: PALOMINO
D: God. And all this time I thought...
N: Palomino and Nicole embrace. Their kiss, like the entire scene, is flat, lifeless, and awful.
S: INT. THE SET
C: NICK
D: Cut. Very good.
C: WOLF
D: Not for camera. Chad was completely out of frame.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy? Forget your cue?
C: PALOMINO
D: Oh no, man. I held back. It really felt like something Damian would do; holding back to the last moment.
C: NICK
D: Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: I don't care when he moves. Just give me a fucking cue.
C: PALOMINO
D: The Lone Wolf!
C: NICK
D: What line did he move on?
C: SCRIPT
D: "Why didn't you tell me?"
C: NICK
D: Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole, how does that feel to you?
C: NICOLE
D: Fine, if that's what Chad wants to do.
C: PALOMINO
D: "Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's shoot; I'm stoked!
C: NICK
D: One second, Chad.
N: Nick approaches the bed and speaks quietly to Chad and Nicole.
C: NICK
D: Chad, how would you describe this scene, in one word?
C: PALOMINO
D: Great. It's a great scene, man.
C: NICK
D: No, I mean it's a love scene. Right?
C: PALOMINO
D: Definitely.
C: NICK
D: These two people really love each other. And we want to see that, especially in the kiss.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, say no more, Chief.
C: NICK
D: Nicole?
C: NICOLE
D: I understand, Chief.
C: NICK
D: Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take two!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE TWO. DAY
C: NICOLE
D: I've always admired you from afar.
N: Palomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking and causing the camera crew and Nicole considerable confusion.
C: PALOMINO
D: Admired? That sounds rather professional.
C: NICOLE
D: Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
C: PALOMINO
D: It sounds like the champagne talking.
C: NICOLE
D: I've loved you from the moment we met.
C: PALOMINO
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: NICOLE
D: We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere.
C: PALOMINO
D: God. And all this time I thought...
N: The scene once again is awful. Nick gives their listless kiss a few moments then calls CUT.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: NICK
D: And, cut. Very good. Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: Chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought you were going to hold back till "me"?
C: PALOMINO
D: The more I thought about it the more it didn't seem right. And I'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if I just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down?
C: NICK
D: I don't know, that seems a little...
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas here. Trying to get the juices flowing.
C: NICK
D: Nicole, how does that feel to you?
C: NICOLE
D: Well, I can turn to look at him. But won't you be shooting the back of my head?
C: WOLF
D: Plus Chad is completely out of the light down there.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my face, man. It's about the acting; that's all I care about.
C: WOLF
D: It's your call, Nick. His acting or his face.
C: NICK
D: For some reason I was hoping we could get both. I thought that's what we were trying to do here.
E: laughs
C: WOLF
D: I'll have to set another light.
C: WANDA
D: We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for Mr. Palomino.
C: NICK
D: Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian; let's talk for a second.
N: As Nick, Nicole, and Palomino step off the set Wanda speaks to the crew in general.
C: WANDA
D: We'll pause to set this light and go again right away. How long, Wolf?
N: Wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, watching the Gaffer set up a light.
C: WANDA
D: Wolf?
N: Wolf walks away from Wanda without a word. The entire crew watches this.
S: INT. A CORNER. DAY
N: Nick, Palomino, and Nicole confer, all three smoking.
C: NICK
D: OK, let's make sure we know what's going on here. These two people have loved each other for years, each of them not knowing the other was in love with them. And tonight, in this little room it all comes out. It's like a dam bursting. Does that make sense? Nicole?
C: NICOLE
D: It makes perfect sense. I just haven't found it yet. I'll get it though.
C: NICK
D: What about you, Chad?
C: PALOMINO
D: I'm there, man. I got the dam going, the river, everything. You watch, that little change in the blocking is going to open the whole scene up for me.
C: WANDA
D: We're ready, Nick!
E: V.O.
C: NICK
D: Good. Let's go.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: WANDA
D: Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take three!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE THREE. DAY
C: NICOLE
D: I've always admired you from afar.
N: Palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing Nicole to turn her head completely away from the camera.
C: PALOMINO
D: Admired? That sounds rather professional.
C: NICOLE
D: Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
C: PALOMINO
D: It sounds like the champagne talking.
C: NICOLE
D: I've loved you from the moment we met.
C: PALOMINO
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: NICOLE
D: We were working together -- I'm sorry, can we cut, Nick?
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: NICK
D: Cut!
C: WANDA
D: That's a cut!
C: PALOMINO
D: Dammit! That was a good one!
C: NICOLE
D: I know, I'm sorry. But this feels really awkward; turning all the way around like this.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, I think the lying on the bed is not quite working, Chad. Let's try one with the original blocking.
C: PALOMINO
D: Which one was that? There's been so many damn changes. Could somebody help me out please?
C: SCRIPT
D: The cue for the original blocking is "professional."
C: PALOMINO
D: Thank you. Thank you very much.
E: intimate
C: NICK
D: OK, right away. Call it, Wanda.
C: NICOLE
D: Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is that alright?
C: NICK
D: Of course, Nicole; are you kidding? Hold the roll, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Holding the roll!
N: Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence.
S: INT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY
N: Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh.
C: PALOMINO
D: Someone over here smells very, very nice.
E: whispers
N: Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, blushing furiously.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some real emotion in herself.
C: NICK
D: Call it, Wanda.
E: with quiet intensity
C: WANDA
D: And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take four!
C: PALOMINO
D: Nick, I just had a great idea!
E: suddenly
C: WANDA
D: Hold the roll!
C: NICK
D: What is it, Chad?
C: PALOMINO
D: Just stop me if I'm out of line here, but she says "admired from afar," right? Doesn't it make sense to see Damian up close and her "afar?" You start on a Close-up of Damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two-shot that you and the Wolfmeister have set up here.
C: NICK
D: What do you think, Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: I don't like it. This is Ellen's scene.
C: NICK
D: I don't know; it sort of makes sense.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, you did it, man. It's all there in the writing.
C: WOLF
D: I'd have to relight.
N: Nick pauses, thinking hard.
C: WANDA
D: We're still ahead of schedule, Nick; if that means anything to you.
C: NICK
D: Let's do it.
C: WOLF
D: Get me a tweenie right here, with diffusion.
E: to the Gaffer
C: WANDA
D: OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing briefly to set one little light, then we're going again, right away. Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino.
C: GAFFER
D: I'll do it.
C: WOLF
D: Get the fucking light!
S: INT. CRAFT SERVICE TABLE. DAY
N: Several members of the crew loiter around the table. The Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. Palomino notices her and moves quietly to her side. Without a word he picks up the milk and pours some in her coffee. Nicole stands nearby and watches the following exchange.
C: SCRIPT
D: Thanks.
C: PALOMINO
D: My pleasure. Sugar?
C: SCRIPT
D: Just a bit.
N: Palomino puts sugar in her coffee with extreme care.
C: PALOMINO
D: You like jazz?
C: SCRIPT
D: Very much.
C: PALOMINO
D: Maybe we could go hear some tonight.
N: Palomino smiles and moves away just as Wanda comes up for a coffee refill.
C: WANDA
D: It's going well I think. Don't you think?
C: SCRIPT
D: Very well. What time do you think we'll finish?
C: WANDA
D: Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz club tonight.
C: SCRIPT
D: Really? So am I. He's wonderful, isn't he?
C: WANDA
D: Chad?
C: SCRIPT
D: He's so natural, like... air.
N: Nicole approaches.
C: SCRIPT
D: I wonder what his sign is. Do you know, Nicole?
C: NICOLE
D: I don't know his sign, but I think his moon is in Uranus.
N: Wanda chokes hard on her coffee as Nicole walks off with a bitter smile.
C: SCRIPT
D: You don't have to be nasty.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Palomino saunters onto the set as Wolf and his crew finish relighting.
C: PALOMINO
D: Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark?
C: WOLF
D: Until you change it. Where's my fucking eyepatch?!
N: Wolf walks off. The Gaffer slips the AC a shrewd wink then walks over and stands next to Palomino, giving him a big, friendly grin.
C: GAFFER
D: Hey, Chad.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, whatya say.
C: GAFFER
D: I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show.
C: PALOMINO
D: Chad Palomino; Actor.
C: GAFFER
D: I know.
E: big smile
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, what's your name?
E: to the ac
C: AC
D: Maurice.
C: PALOMINO
D: Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking crew guys, really.
N: The Gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and begins leafing through it.
C: GAFFER
D: Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a script.
C: PALOMINO
D: Oh, yeah?
N: Palomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the room. He points to the light.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, Bill. See that light over there?
C: GAFFER
D: Uh, yeah.
C: PALOMINO
D: Lower it about three feet.
N: Palomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off. The Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment.
S: INT. BATHROOM. DAY
N: Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.
C: NICK
D: Would you care to have a drink tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you say you and I have a drink tonight?
N: Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, Nick! I'm sorry!
C: NICK
D: That's OK, no problem. I'm just slapping a little water on my face.
N: The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.
C: NICK
D: So, it's going pretty good, huh?
C: NICOLE
D: Is it? Something feels off.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, you seem a little tense.
C: NICOLE
D: Do I?
C: NICK
D: But don't worry about it. Just take your attention off yourself and put it on Chad. Work off him a little more.
C: NICOLE
D: OK, I'll try that.
C: NICK
D: And listen, I know he's no Olivier. But he's got something, don't you think? Kind of a natural presence.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh yes, he's very natural.
N: Nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the question.
C: NICK
D: So Nicole... anything else I can help you with?
C: NICOLE
D: Actually there is. Could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth?
C: NICK
D: Oh, sure.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the camera. Wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away.
C: WOLF
D: My eye is killing me.
C: WANDA
D: Put your eyepatch on.
C: WOLF
D: I lost it.
C: WANDA
D: Is that little light set yet?
C: WOLF
D: That little light was set ten minutes ago.
C: WANDA
D: Get me the A Team in here right away. Nick, Nicole, and Mr. Palomino. Why didn't you tell me?
E: into her walkie to Wolf
C: WOLF
D: Hey, you're not worried about the time, I'm not worried about the time.
C: WANDA
D: Oh, I am very worried about the time!
C: WOLF
D: I know you are.
C: WANDA
D: What is that supposed to mean?
C: WOLF
D: What do you think it means?!
C: WANDA
D: I don't know what it means!
C: WOLF
D: Oh yes you do, you know exactly what it means.
C: WANDA
D: I have no idea what you're talking about! Why are you --
C: WOLF
D: You don't understand me, Wanda! You have no idea --
C: WANDA
D: I don't understand you?!! All I do is take care of you!!!
N: Nick suddenly runs up just as Wolf and Wanda are on the verge of blows.
C: NICK
D: Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a very intimate scene and a lot of tension on the set doesn't help. OK? Now, Wolf, let's just go through the first part of the move. Damian, on your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian; Ellen in the background.
N: Nick suddenly sees Palomino is wearing a black eyepatch.
C: NICK
D: Chad, what are you doing?
C: WOLF
D: Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.
C: PALOMINO
D: Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm telling you, Nick; it really feels right. I feel like this guy now, man.
C: NICK
D: I don't know, Chad. I don't think it works.
C: PALOMINO
D: You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight you on this one.
C: WOLF
D: Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I don't want anyone wearing it. It's insanitary.
N: Palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to Wolf.
C: PALOMINO
D: Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send someone out for an eyepatch. I'll fucking pay for it myself.
N: Nick pulls Palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially.
C: NICK
D: Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say this in front of Wolf but it makes you look a little... gay.
C: PALOMINO
D: Really?
C: NICK
D: Yeah, a little bit.
C: PALOMINO
D: Jesus.
N: Palomino sneaks a glance back at Wolf then whispers to Nick.
C: PALOMINO
D: You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good call.
C: WANDA
D: Are you ready, Nick?
C: NICK
D: One second. You need a rehearsal, Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: Let's just fucking shoot it!!
C: PALOMINO
D: El Lobo!
N: Palomino winks at Nick and walks back to his new mark, making a barely audible howling sound behind his hand.
C: NICK
D: Call it, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take four!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FOUR
N: The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all it's worth.
C: NICOLE
D: I've always admired you from afar.
C: PALOMINO
D: Admired? That sounds rather professional.
C: NICOLE
D: Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
N: Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with extreme care and concentration.
C: PALOMINO
D: It sounds like the champagne talking.
C: NICOLE
D: I've loved you from the moment we met.
C: PALOMINO
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: NICOLE
D: We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere -- God!
N: Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and begins pacing at the rear of the set.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: NICK
D: Cut!
C: WANDA
D: That's a cut. Hold the work, going again, right away.
C: NICOLE
D: I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry.
N: Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a curtness that is a little startling.
C: PALOMINO
D: Nick, could I talk to you a second?
N: Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head indicating his wish for Nick to follow him.
C: WANDA
D: A momentary delay. Everyone stand by. We're going again, right away.
C: SOUND
D: Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low on that take.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually could I listen to the take before?
N: The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last take are heard through the headphones.
S: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
N: Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers fiercely.
C: PALOMINO
D: I'm out of here, man!
C: NICK
D: What's the matter?!
C: PALOMINO
D: I like you, but I made a big mistake taking this part. Have someone call me a cab.
C: NICK
D: Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to me. What's going on!?
C: PALOMINO
D: I can't act with this woman. I know she's a friend of yours but I got to tell you: she cannot act worth a shit! I'm giving her everything! The whole thing I just did with the hair; did you see that? I came up with that on my own because I thought it would help her. But no, she's giving me nothing! I'm out of here.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take.
C: PALOMINO
D: God, and all this time I thought...
E: the muted rustle of the kiss
N: The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the open set window.
C: PALOMINO
D: Why did you cast her? She sucked in that Richard Gere movie!
E: V.O.
C: NICK
D: You're right. She is not the best actress in the world. I see that now but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm asking you to please help me here. We've got to get through this somehow.
E: V.O.
N: The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the mike.
S: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
N: Camera is close on Nick and Palomino.
C: PALOMINO
D: I'll tell you what this is about, man. You know why she took a cab this morning?
C: NICK
D: Something came up.
C: PALOMINO
D: No. She was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm sorry it had to come out like this but I told her this morning "thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight -- it was just a one-time deal," and she didn't want to hear that. She wanted more, you see what I'm saying? It's rejection.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her from behind the set.
C: NICK
D: Nicole, listen...
C: NICOLE
D: Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. I apologize. Chad, I apologize to you too. I'm completely unfocused here and I think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow.
N: Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment.
C: NICK
D: What would you like to do?
C: NICOLE
D: I was wondering if we could try improvising the scene. More along the lines of what Chad has been doing. Maybe that would help me find something.
N: Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced.
C: NICK
D: That's a fantastic idea. What do you think, Chad?
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, that's the only way I can work. Let's take it apart, let's cut loose.
C: NICK
D: Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why not?!
C: PALOMINO
D: Roll that motherfucking camera, Wolfie!
C: WOLF
D: Kiss my ass!
N: Although Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear him because he suddenly yells:
C: PALOMINO
D: Yeah! Let's go!
C: NICK
D: Alright, now we're making a fucking movie! Call it, Wanda!
C: WANDA
D: Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take five!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FIVE. THE IMPROV
N: Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a great show of loosening up.
C: NICOLE
D: I've always admired you from afar.
C: PALOMINO
D: Have you? That's, wow; that's incredible. But that sounds kind of professional doesn't it? Admired?
C: NICOLE
D: You're right. How does despised sound?
C: PALOMINO
D: Great! What's it mean?
E: laughs
C: NICOLE
D: It's sort of like I think you're a piece of shit.
E: laughs
N: Palomino is somewhat startled by this. He looks to Nick in confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going.
C: PALOMINO
D: That sounds like the champagne talking.
E: another laugh
C: NICOLE
D: It's not. I really do think you are a piece of shit.
C: PALOMINO
D: No, you don't. You love me.
C: NICOLE
D: The fuck I do. I can't stand looking at you!
C: PALOMINO
D: Then I guess I have nothing else to say.
C: NICOLE
D: No, I think you have a lot more to say, Damian.
C: PALOMINO
D: Well, I am surprised you feel this way, Ellen. I always thought you admired --
C: NICOLE
D: That's not what I meant. You should tell everyone what you just told Nick behind the set.
C: PALOMINO
D: Hey, this isn't part of the scene.
C: NICOLE
D: Say it anyway: The reason this scene isn't working is because you and I slept together last night. Did everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad last night!
N: Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.
C: PALOMINO
D: See, Nick! I told you this was about rejection!
C: NICOLE
D: You fucking scumbag! You think I give a rat's ass about you?! I was there to get laid and even that was a joke!
C: PALOMINO
D: You know, you are really starting to piss me off!
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit!
N: Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other side of the bed.
C: NICOLE
D: Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come on!
N: Nick steps between Nicole and Palomino.
C: NICK
D: OK, guys, I think we can stop there.
C: PALOMINO
D: You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda, call me a cab!
C: NICK
D: Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to calm down.
C: PALOMINO
D: Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This movie is bullshit.
C: NICK
D: Now wait a second, Chad. There's no reason for hostility.
C: PALOMINO
D: Shut up, you fucking loser. The only reason I took this part was because someone said you knew Quentin Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.
C: NICK
D: Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of your shit, you hostess twinkie motherfucker!
C: PALOMINO
D: What'd you call me?
C: NICK
D: You heard me.
C: PALOMINO
D: Say it again.
C: NICK
D: You hostess twinkie motherfucker!
N: Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of his head. Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as Wanda rushes forward.
C: WANDA
D: Alright, everyone just stop. Stop! Stop this right now!
N: As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves her hard, knocking her down. Instantly Wolf leaps off the camera and runs up to Palomino.
C: WOLF
D: Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!
N: Palomino suddenly punches Wolf in the teeth, dropping him like a stone.
C: WANDA
D: Wolf!
E: shrieks
N: Suddenly Nick staggers to his feet and rushes at Palomino. His momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, Palomino's head cracking Nicole in the teeth.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, God!
N: Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed. Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding his head against the mattress.
C: NICK
D: You want to pick my brain?! This is the way I direct hostess twinkie scumbags like you!
N: As Nick continues to pound Palomino's head the Gaffer notices Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of Nick's forearm around his neck. He and the Boom man rush forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free.
C: NICK
D: Get him out of here! Someone take him back to his hotel!
N: As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious Palomino, the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.
C: SCRIPT
D: Chad...
E: sniffling
N: Suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for Nick's labored breathing and the Scriptgirl's sniffles. Nick leans over and touches Nicole's shoulder.
C: NICK
D: Are you alright?
C: NICOLE
D: Don't touch me.
S: EXT. DAY. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE SET
N: The Gaffer and AC help the still-groggy Palomino into the back of the production van. JEFF, the driver, watches them in sleepy curiosity. With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the AC goes back to the set. The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless hand.
C: GAFFER
D: It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese tidal wave hits New York. You've an ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working undercover. You save the city. You'd be perfect for the lead. That's my number; call me, or I'll call you. Either way it's been great working with you, man.
N: As Palomino stares at him blankly, the Gaffer slams the door. The car pulls out.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Nick and Nicole are sitting up on the bed, alone on the now empty set.
C: NICK
D: Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. You were great in that Richard Gere movie.
C: NICOLE
D: Shut up. You're no different than he is. You lie, you're deceitful...
C: NICK
D: I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone how great you are. I've got nothing but respect and admiration for you.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh God, now you're doing your own fucking script.
C: NICK
D: Well, why do you think I wrote it?!
C: NICOLE
D: I have no idea!
C: NICK
D: It's about you. It's about how I feel about you.
C: NICOLE
D: Christ, did you get a bump on your head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking like an idiot.
C: NICK
D: Nicole. I've loved you since the day we met.
N: Nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence.
C: NICOLE
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: NICK
D: I didn't want anything to get in the way of us working together.
C: NICOLE
D: God, and all this time I thought...
N: Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN
N: Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running in the bathroom.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, God.
N: Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS. The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent.
C: WANDA
D: Don't go out that door!
N: Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: AC
D: Why not?
C: WANDA
D: It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now go around.
C: AC
D: Next time. This is an emergency.
N: The AC rushes past and a moment later the camera DOLLIES slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the set camera.
C: WANDA
D: Has Ellen showed up yet?
E: into her walkie
C: WALKIE
D: ssss... kkkkkrrk.
C: WANDA
D: Get her into wardrobe right away.
C: WALKIE
D: ssskk... ssssrrrk?
C: WANDA
D: No! Scene six; Scene five has been postponed. I'm not going to say it again; Mr. Palomino is not working today. Now where is that smoke machine!
S: INT. SET BUILDING, HALLWAY. DAY
N: The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.
C: AC
D: Oh. Sorry.
N: Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed.
C: TITO
D: What do you want?!
C: AC
D: I need to use the bathroom. Kind of an emergency.
C: TITO
D: Well, fucking knock!!
N: Tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the AC staring after him in astonishment.
C: TITO
D: I swear to Christ, one of these days I'm going to punch somebody in the balls!
E: muttering
S: INT. WARDROBE ROOM. DAY
N: Camera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin white veil is placed on her head. Camera pulls back to reveal SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white wedding gown. Nick stands nearby, smoking.
C: NICK
D: Just as we pull up to your apartment Palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today.
C: NICOLE
D: God. Was it something he ate?
C: SACHIKO
D: Stand up, please.
C: NICK
D: I don't know.
C: NICOLE
D: Can he work tomorrow?
C: SACHIKO
D: Turn around, please.
C: NICK
D: Don't know that either. But I'm not worrying about it. I had this dream last night where I was on the set. You were in it, and another woman, someone older. Anyway, everything was going wrong. The harder I tried to hold things together the more they fell apart. And you know what that dream was telling me, Nicole? You just got to roll with it. And that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling with it. So, we'll just shoot the Dream Sequence today.
N: Just then Tito walks in.
C: NICK
D: Hey, Tito. You look great, man.
C: TITO
D: I feel like shit.
C: NICK
D: No, you look good. Thanks for coming in on such short notice. This is Nicole; she's playing Ellen.
C: NICOLE
D: Hello. Toto, is it?
C: TITO
D: Tito.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, I'm sorry.
C: NICK
D: Listen, if there's anything I can do to make you... if you need... uh, just let me know.
C: TITO
D: Put a stool in the bathroom.
N: Tito walks out, followed immediately by Sachiko, leaving Nicole alone with Nick.
C: NICK
D: Did I just offend him?
C: NICOLE
D: What did you say?
C: NICK
D: "Short notice?"
C: NICOLE
D: Come on; that was nothing. I'm the one who called him "Toto." Jesus, I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the set last night too.
C: NICK
D: Oh yeah?
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah. You were in the dream.
C: NICK
D: Was I freaking out?
C: NICOLE
D: Actually, you were.
C: NICK
D: That's great: I freak out in my dream; I freak out in your dream. No wonder I'm fucking exhausted.
C: NICOLE
D: Nick...
C: NICK
D: Yeah?
N: Nicole stares at Nick for a long moment then smiles briefly and turns away.
S: INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY
N: A dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle of the set. WOLF (with eyepatch), the GAFFER, AC, BOOM MAN, and the SOUND MAN stand around it, scrutinizing it intently. Wolf seems in an unusually good mood.
C: WOLF
D: Alright, guys; special effects today. Could be fun. Who knows how to work this baby?
C: GAFFER
D: It's the old T-160. I used it once in '85.
C: AC
D: Damn. '85.
C: WOLF
D: What's this?
C: GAFFER
D: That's where the gas goes.
C: BOOM
D: No, that's where the oil goes.
C: GAFFER
D: Is it?
C: BOOM
D: I think so.
C: GAFFER
D: You're right. It's coming back now.
C: WOLF
D: I'm going to let you handle this one, Bob. This is your baby. And Les, if he needs help you give him a hand. OK, guys? We're all working together today.
N: Wolf walks off. The Gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine closer.
C: GAFFER
D: Yup, all coming back now. Like riding a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160.
C: AC
D: Way to go, Bob.
S: INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA
N: Wanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops in battle. Nick approaches her.
C: NICK
D: How are we doing, Wanda?
C: WANDA
D: Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not good. We need to finish this scene and do Scene thirty-one today.
C: NICK
D: Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't know we were --
C: WANDA
D: Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to your apartment to pick them up. Now, relax.
C: NICK
D: Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment to pick them up; it's the red notebook, under the bed.
C: WANDA
D: It's taken care of, Nick.
C: NICK
D: Good. Great. Good.
N: Nick walks off quickly, muttering to himself. A moment later Wolf strolls up to Wanda.
C: WOLF
D: We're all lit, the smoke machine is under control; we're ready to go.
C: WANDA
D: What about the dolly?
E: hard
C: WOLF
D: Just need to see a run-through and we're all set. I'm going to make your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful. Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume. And don't worry about Palomino; I'll take you to a jazz club tonight.
E: he slips his arm around her
C: WANDA
D: Oh, I can't make it. I have to go see Chad; he's extremely ill.
C: WOLF
D: Oh, by the way my eye's much better.
C: WANDA
D: Listen, Wolf, this may not be the best time to say this but our relationship is going nowhere.
C: WOLF
D: What do you mean?
C: WANDA
D: Please, don't take it personally. Because I care for you, Wolf, I really do. But I've had this feeling for quite a while and I think it's time we ended it. OK?
C: WOLF
D: OK.
E: pause
C: WANDA
D: I think it's better.
C: WOLF
D: So do I.
C: WANDA
D: Well, good. Still friends?
C: WOLF
D: Sure.
C: WANDA
D: Great, cause we still have to work together and there's no reason it has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug.
N: Wanda and Wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace.
C: WANDA
D: You're a real special guy, Wolf.
C: WOLF
D: Thanks.
N: Wanda slips Wolf a tender smile then walks away.
C: WANDA
D: OK, let's get the A Team in please! Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito!
E: into her walkie
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Nick is working with the crew and the actors. The set consists of two flats (one with the fake door) joined to make a corner. The flats are painted fire-engine red.
C: NICK
D: OK, here's the shot. We start wide with Ellen standing absolutely still right in the middle of the frame. You got that, Wolf?
C: WOLF
D: Yeah.
C: NICK
D: What happened to your eye?
E: notices eyepatch
C: WOLF
D: Nothing. It's a little sensitive today.
C: NICK
D: Can you see?
C: WOLF
D: Of course I can see!
E: snaps
N: For a moment Nick looks like he might snap back at Wolf but he draws a deep breath and continues.
C: NICK
D: OK, Ellen is standing there. The smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's line.
C: NICOLE
D: I am so hungry.
C: NICK
D: Good, Tito, that's your cue.
N: The fake door opens and Tito enters wearing his top hat and carrying a golden apple in his gloved hands.
C: NICK
D: You walk around her once, hold the apple out, that's right; just beyond her reach. You're staring at her hard. Harder, good. Then stop right here. Can we get a mark, please?
N: The AC moves up to Nick and places a piece of yellow tape on the floor. CU the yellow tape.
C: NICK
D: Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up. Alright, Wolf?
C: WANDA
D: It should be hand-held.
C: NICK
D: No, I think it's better on the dolly.
C: WOLF
D: Whatever.
C: NICOLE
D: Nick, do I see him?
C: NICK
D: No, just the apple. And Tito, right after we dolly in give me a little laugh there.
C: TITO
D: A little laugh?
C: NICK
D: Big, little; anything you feel like doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one. Call it, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: OK, here we go. Camera back to One. Action on the smoke.
N: The Gaffer turns on the smoke machine which emits a pathetic wisp of smoke that immediately dissipates.
C: WANDA
D: And roll sound.
C: NICK
D: Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little more smoke? Is that possible?
C: GAFFER
D: Oh, sure.
N: The Gaffer adjusts a knob and another thin puff of smoke wheezes out.
C: NICK
D: Good. Call it, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take one!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE ONE. DAY
N: Nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. Her white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red walls. A sad shred of smoke drifts by her head.
C: NICOLE
D: I am so hungry.
N: Tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole. His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. He walks around her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her reach. He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a CU of him. He doesn't laugh. Nick watches this for a moment in intense concentration.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: NICK
D: And... cut.
C: WANDA
D: That's a cut. Nick; comments?
C: NICK
D: Yeah, just a couple. I thought that was uh... good. Tito, that was very good, man, really. You didn't feel like laughing?
C: TITO
D: I laughed.
C: NICK
D: Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You could make it bigger if you want. And Ellen, maybe just a little more tension when you see him.
C: NICOLE
D: I thought I didn't see him.
C: NICK
D: Right, maybe you see him a little bit.
C: NICOLE
D: Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him or not?
C: NICK
D: You see him.
C: NICOLE
D: OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto?
C: TITO
D: It's Tito.
E: hard
C: NICOLE
D: What did I say?
E: alarmed
C: TITO
D: Toto.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't know why I'm doing that. I'm really sorry.
C: NICK
D: Ellen, come on now; concentrate. Remember; you're marrying Damian tomorrow. You're a little anxious. You have this dream. Let's call it an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents the anxiety.
N: CU Tito looking none too happy about this representation.
C: NICK
D: OK? It seems pretty simple.
C: NICOLE
D: Let's just try it.
C: NICK
D: Good. And Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one.
C: GAFFER
D: OK, more smoke.
C: WOLF
D: I still think it should be hand-held.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, well, I don't want it hand- held. I want it on the dolly. Where's my notebook, Wanda?
C: WANDA
D: On it's way, Nick.
C: NICK
D: Good. Call it, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Lock it up. Going for picture. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take two!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE TWO
N: Nicole stands motionless as a few more emaciated puffs of smoke hang in the air.
C: NICOLE
D: I am so hungry.
N: Tito enters, walks around her holding the apple just beyond her reach then moves to his mark. The camera dollies into a CU. He does not laugh.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: NICK
D: Cut.
C: WANDA
D: That's a cut. Going again, Nick?
C: NICK
D: Yes.
C: WANDA
D: Going again, please stand by.
C: NICK
D: OK, Ellen, good. You're on to something there.
C: NICOLE
D: No, something's not right. It all feels fake to me.
N: Nick's tone with Nicole suddenly takes on an almost imperceptible edge, tinged with annoyance.
C: NICK
D: Well, it's not fake; it's real. Just remember, you really want the apple. Tito, I still think we could see more of a laugh at the end.
C: TITO
D: What kind of laugh?
C: NICK
D: Just a laugh.
C: TITO
D: Show me.
C: NICK
D: Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
N: Everyone watches Nick demonstrate the laugh. He seems unaware he resembles a drunken, slightly annoyed idiot.
C: NICK
D: Something like that. OK? And remember, Tito, this is a dream. Not everything has to make sense. A laugh right there heightens our sense of... of...
C: TITO
D: Anxiety.
C: NICK
D: Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?
C: WOLF
D: I still think it should be hand-held.
C: NICK
D: Well, God damn it! It's not going to be! It's on the dolly so just forget about it!
E: snaps
N: There is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone witnesses this rebuke.
C: NICK
D: And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke? Might as well get a couple hamsters in here blowing smoke rings for Christ's sake.
C: GAFFER
D: The septic valve wasn't open. I got it now. We're going to see some smoke now.
C: NICK
D: Alright, let's try another take.
C: WANDA
D: And, lock it up.
C: WOLF
D: Nick, could I talk to you for a minute?
C: NICK
D: What?!
C: WOLF
D: In private.
C: NICK
D: Alright.
E: sighs in exasperation
N: Nick follows Wolf off the set.
C: WANDA
D: Release the lock-up. Everyone stand by.
C: GAFFER
D: We'll see some smoke now.
C: AC
D: Way to go, Bob.
S: INT. A CORNER. DAY
N: As soon as Wolf and Nick reach the darkened corner, Wolf whirls to face Nick.
C: WOLF
D: I really don't like being spoken to like that, Nick!
C: NICK
D: Yeah, well I don't like your attitude!
C: WOLF
D: I don't have an attitude!
C: NICK
D: The hell you don't! Every time I ask you to do something all I get is No, No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired you to do a job; if you're not going to do it you better let me know right now!
N: Wolf is about to yell back at Nick when suddenly he stops and lets out a deep, painful sigh.
C: WOLF
D: I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through some heavy shit.
C: NICK
D: What do you mean?
C: WOLF
D: I can't really go into it. It's pretty heavy.
C: NICK
D: Personal?
N: Wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward Wanda who is standing some distance away watching them. Seeing the two men looking at her Wanda shoots them a hard glare which prompts Wolf and Nick to turn away quickly.
C: WOLF
D: Personal, professional, emotional. It's doing a number on me. And now you're telling me you're going to fire me.
C: NICK
D: I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on, I'm not going to fire you. You're doing a great job here.
C: WOLF
D: Am I?
C: NICK
D: Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without you, man. You've got a great eye. I just hope it's not the one under that eyepatch.
N: Nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but Wolf's only response is to stare back at him sadly.
C: NICK
D: Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one thing I've learned; sometimes you just have to roll with things. You know?
C: WOLF
D: You're right.
C: NICK
D: Roll with it, man. You'll be OK.
N: Wolf lets out another deep sigh.
C: WOLF
D: Thanks, bro.
S: INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY
N: The Gaffer, Boom man, and AC kneel around the smoke machine. A can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them.
C: BOOM
D: That's where the oil goes.
C: GAFFER
D: No, that's where the gas goes.
C: BOOM
D: I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where the oil goes.
C: SOUND
D: Lester, don't you think Bob knows where the oil goes?!
C: GAFFER
D: I don't remember using oil in '85.
C: AC
D: Maybe both the oil and gas go in there?
N: The Gaffer and Boom man turn and look at the AC for a long moment.
C: BOOM
D: I think he's right.
C: GAFFER
D: I think he is too. OK, three parts gas, one part oil.
N: The Gaffer and Boom man pour liberal amounts of gas and oil into the T-160.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Nick rushes up to his position by the camera.
C: NICK
D: Is my notebook here yet, Wanda?
C: WANDA
D: Any minute, Nick.
C: NICK
D: Good. Call it, Wanda.
C: WANDA
D: Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!

D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take three!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE THREE
N: Nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress, looking genuinely alarmed, possibly because of the huge clouds of smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine.
C: NICOLE
D: I am so hungry.
N: Tito enters, stares at her hard and walks around her in a circle holding the apple just beyond her reach. The smoke is so thick both of them are barely visible. Just as Tito gets to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding smoke.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: The smoke blanks out the entire frame. Frantic shouts are heard from unseen bodies.
C: NICK
D: Cut! Cut! Cut!
C: WANDA
D: Turn it off! Turn it off!
C: GAFFER
D: I can't find the switch!
C: WOLF
D: Pull the plug! Bob! Pull the plug!
C: WANDA
D: Open the door! Get some water!
C: GAFFER
D: I got it! I got it!
N: The smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the room with sudden silence. Slowly the smoke begins to clear as the crew moves around muttering and coughing.
C: WANDA
D: Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please step off the set!
C: TITO
D: I'm off the set!
E: V.O.
C: NICOLE
D: So am I.
E: V.O.
C: WANDA
D: Then who is that? Who is that? Please step off the set!
N: A pair of fuzzy-slippered feet enter the smoky frame. The camera BOOMS up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest on the pleasantly smiling face of CORA. This is the same woman who played Ellen's Mother in Part One; she is dressed exactly the same as she was in their scene. The camera pulls back to reveal JEFF the Intern standing nervously beside her with a red notebook in his hands.
C: CORA
D: Hi, Nicky.
N: Nick gapes in utter astonishment.
C: NICK
D: Mom!
S: INT. THE SET PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY
N: Wanda speaks urgently into the phone while Nicole stands beside her. Jeff (still wearing his hat) waits at a distance clutching Nick's red notebook.
C: WANDA
D: Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat, blue slippers. How do I know? Because she's sitting ten feet away from me. Well sweetheart, that's going to be a real fucking problem.
N: Nicole turns away and walks past Jeff to the Craft Service table.
C: JEFF
D: She was waiting outside Nick's apartment when I went to pick up his notebook. She said she was looking for him so I figured I should just bring her up here. You look really pretty in that dress.
N: Nicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother.
S: INT. MAKEUP CORNER
C: NICK
D: How did you get here?
C: CORA
D: I took a bus in; went right to your apartment.
C: NICK
D: How did you get out of your room?
C: CORA
D: Oh, I just went right through the door.
C: NICK
D: It was unlocked!?
C: CORA
D: No, it was locked. I just went through it. It's something I've learned to do, Nicky. I can walk through just about anything; like air.
C: NICK
D: Mom, you've got to stop doing this. I'm serious. I'm a little upset with you. You could have gotten lost, or hurt.
C: CORA
D: I wanted to see you. I've missed you.
C: NICK
D: I know, Mom; I've missed you too. But it's not really a good time.
N: Nicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown. There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick.
C: NICOLE
D: They're sending a car. It should be here in a couple of hours. They didn't even know she was gone.
C: NICK
D: Jesus, I don't believe this.
C: CORA
D: I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was going to be a wedding I would have worn my fucking hat.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: The camera holds on Tito pacing slowly, alone on the set. He is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand. Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow.
S: INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY
N: Nick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down. Nicole joins Tito on the set and talks quietly to him.
C: NICK
D: There. How's that, Mom? Can you see?
C: CORA
D: Is the little fellow going to do gymnastics?
N: Tito glances up at her quickly.
C: NICK
D: Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet. OK?
C: CORA
D: OK.
E: whispers
S: INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY
N: Wanda and Wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward silence for a long moment.
C: WANDA
D: How are you doing?
C: WOLF
D: Good; real good.
N: Wolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as Nick walks up.
C: NICK
D: How's the smoke machine?
C: WANDA
D: It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out to every Effects house in the city but I just can't seem to locate --
C: NICK
D: Forget it. We'll shoot without it.
C: WANDA
D: But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence.
C: NICK
D: That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're just going to have to roll with it. Nothing else we can do. We've got to roll with it, right, Wolf?
N: Wolf meets Nick's eyes and gives an extremely melancholy nod. Nick turns to address Nicole and Tito and the edge immediately slips back into his voice.
C: NICK
D: OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to keep reaching for that apple. I don't feel that you really want it. I mean, Christ, how many times do I have to tell you!
N: Nicole glares at Nick for a moment then abruptly turns and walks off the set. Nick stares after her in confusion then quickly follows her.
C: WANDA
D: Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going again, right away.
S: EXT. STREET. NYC. DAY
N: Nicole stands with her back to the camera as Nick strides up to her with impatience.
C: NICK
D: Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?
C: NICOLE
D: You tell me! You're the one with the bug up your ass!
C: NICK
D: Now wait just a second!
C: NICOLE
D: You've been picking on me all day! I can't do anything right!
C: NICK
D: I'm sorry if I was short with you, Nicole, but I think you can see I'm under a little pressure here. I'm shooting a Dream Sequence without a smoke machine, my mother's out there thinking she's at a circus wedding and you tell me the whole movie seems fake!
C: NICOLE
D: I never said that!
C: NICK
D: You did too. You said, "Everything feels fake."
C: NICOLE
D: I meant me! I feel fake! Everything I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I should just do shower scenes in Richard Gere movies for the rest of my life!
C: NICK
D: Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a fantastic actress. All you have to do is show me you want that apple more than anything else in the world; don't give up. Understand? You cannot give up.
C: NICOLE
D: OK.
N: Suddenly Wanda yells out.
C: WANDA
D: Ready, Nick?!
C: NICK
D: Ready!
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Nick rushes back onto the set.
C: NICK
D: OK, here we go. Everybody focus, concentrate. And Tito, we're still looking for that little laugh, pal. OK? Call it, Wanda!
C: WANDA
D: Picture's up. There will be no smoke in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in the Dream Sequence. And roll sound.
C: SOUND
D: Speed!
C: WANDA
D: Roll camera!
C: AC
D: Rolling!
C: CLAPPER
D: Scene six, take four!
C: NICK
D: And, action.
S: INT. THE DREAM. TAKE FOUR. DAY
N: Nicole stands motionless in her wedding gown.
C: NICOLE
D: I am so hungry.
N: Tito walks in, stares at her hard, then walks around her once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands. He stops and the camera dollies into his CLOSE-UP. Nick watches in hopeful expectation. He waits and waits but Tito does not laugh. Just then the door in the rear set wall opens and Cora steps in, looking oddly puzzled.
C: CORA
D: Oh, I thought this was the TV room.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: NICK
D: Cut!
C: WANDA
D: That's a cut. Going again, right away.
S: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
N: Nick escorts his mother back to her chair.
C: NICK
D: Mom, listen to me. I don't want you to move from this chair. Do you understand?
C: CORA
D: Oh Jesus, you sound just like your father...
C: NICK
D: Mom, I'm serious.
C: CORA
D: OK, OK. I won't move.
C: NICK
D: Thank you.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Nick walks back on the set and addresses Nicole and Tito.
C: NICK
D: OK, good. Very good. Tito, I think we're having a little communication problem here. All I want you to do is laugh. OK?
E: laughs
C: TITO
D: Why?
C: NICK
D: I told you why.
C: TITO
D: Tell me again.
S: INT. OFF THE SET. DAY
N: Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her. Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares even more intently into his eye. Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees this.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: Nick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito.
C: NICK
D: Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal. It's a dream, alright. Strange things happen in a dream. All you have to do is laugh. Why is that such a problem?
C: TITO
D: Why does it have to be a dwarf?
C: NICK
D: What?
C: TITO
D: Why does my character have to be a dwarf?
C: NICK
D: He doesn't have to be a dwarf.
C: TITO
D: Then why is he?! Is that the only way you can make this a dream; put a dwarf in it?
C: NICK
D: No, Tito; that's not --
C: TITO
D: Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? NO! I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them! The only place I've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! Make it weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a dream, there's a fucking dwarf in it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can take this Dream Sequence and shove it up your ass!
N: Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence. Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly.
C: WANDA
D: Nick? I can get right on the phone. We'll try to get another... small person here as soon as possible.
E: no response
C: NICK
D: No. He's absolutely right.
N: Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.
C: WOLF
D: You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick? She could be in the dream by herself.
C: NICK
D: No. We're not going to shoot anything. I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help, but it's over. I can't take it anymore. I tried to roll with it but it's time to face the music; I can't do this. I am not a director. The shoot is over. I give up.
N: Nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not bitter or self-pitying. He seems unaware of how disturbing this is to the crew. They all stand around him in shock, afraid to move or speak. Finally Wolf turns to the AC and puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young son.
C: WOLF
D: Take the camera off the dolly. Start putting it away.
N: Everyone watches the AC unfasten the camera in silence. Nicole stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding the golden apple. Her face is frozen in dismay. Suddenly CORA comes through the set door and marches up to Nicole.
C: CORA
D: Give me that apple!
N: At the sound of his mother's voice, Nick looks up. He sees her snatch the apple from Nicole's hand and march back out the door, closing it behind her.
C: CORA
D: I'm ready, Nick!
E: behind the door
S: INT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY
N: Nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to Wanda, Wolf, and the rest of the crew.
C: NICK
D: Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go. Right away.
N: Wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held) as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into position. On a terse signal from Nick the camera starts rolling.
S: INT. THE SET. THE DREAM. DAY
N: Nicole takes the silent "action" cue from Nick.
C: NICOLE
D: I am so hungry.
N: Right on cue Cora walks through the door, holding the golden apple out in front of her. She circles Nicole with determination, seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her with the hand-held camera. Wolf is now in his element; gliding like Nureyev with the camera. When he pans suddenly with Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera range. Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly. Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole. Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out, grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it. CU Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight. Cora takes one step forward. CU her fuzzy slippers stopping right on the yellow tape mark. Cora waits momentarily until Wolf has reframed both her and Nicole, then lets out a huge laugh.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
C: NICK
D: And cut!!
N: General mayhem erupts on the set.
C: NICK
D: Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get it?
C: WOLF
D: Got it, Nick! Everything!
C: NICK
D: The Close-up?
C: WOLF
D: Perfect. See? That's what I meant about going hand-held!
C: NICK
D: You're a genius, man! What about the focus?!
C: AC
D: Nailed it.
C: WOLF
D: Fuckin' A!
N: Wolf slaps the AC's palm, then the Gaffer's standing right beside him. He turns gleefully to the next person but seeing it is Wanda he rigidly turns away.
C: WANDA
D: Going again, Nick?
C: NICK
D: How was the sound?
C: SOUND
D: I could use another but definitely acceptable.
N: Nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her. Nicole stands beside him.
C: NICK
D: Mom, you kook! That was incredible! Did you know we were filming?
C: CORA
D: Of course I knew you were filming.
E: testily
C: NICK
D: You were great, you're a natural. And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't you dare tell me that felt fake.
N: Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up.
C: WANDA
D: Going again, Nick?
C: NICK
D: Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.
N: The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly, muttering to himself.
C: NICK
D: Can I use it for the Dream Sequence, that's the question. Does it work for the Dream Sequence?
N: Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew.
C: NICK
D: We're going with it, Wanda!
C: WANDA
D: Alright everyone, listen up. That is a wrap on Scene Six.
N: The set erupts in applause.
C: SOUND
D: Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
C: WANDA
D: What?!
C: SOUND
D: I need to record room tone. I'll need thirty seconds of silence.
C: WANDA
D: Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!! Thirty seconds of room tone. The sooner you're quiet the sooner we're done.
C: CORA
D: What's room tone?
E: whispers to Nick
C: NICK
D: It's for the sound, Mom. We just have to be quiet.
N: At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be quiet.
C: WANDA
D: And roll sound. Nobody move.
C: SOUND
D: Speed.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds of reflection. MS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position to record general ambiance while staring off into the distance. CU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision. CU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds have passed. MS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint of a smile. The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, passing over faces in different degrees of thought. CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing ten seconds have passed. MS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him.
S: INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY
N: CHAD PALOMINO stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant in an immaculate tuxedo. He holds an envelope in his hands.

D: We have a new category this year: Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being. And the winner is none other than my Best Bud, Nick Reve!
N: Amid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts an Oscar from Chad. He stands grinning like an idiot as the applause continues.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: MS Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness.
S: INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT
N: Wide shot at the counter. Nicole stands facing a large bald man with his back to the camera. She is wearing a cheap pink waitress uniform and has her hair under a hairnet.
C: MAN
D: Had any experience?
C: NICOLE
D: I was an actress for a while.
N: She pulls her headshot out of her shoulder bag and hands it to the man with a hopeful smile. He flips over the headshot and looks at her credits with confused annoyance.
C: MAN
D: Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?
C: NICOLE
D: Probably.
E: doubtfully
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: MS Nicole. She jerks her head slightly in response to this moment of thought. CU the stopwatch, showing fifteen seconds have passed. MS Wolf. The camera begins a slow DOLLY into his CU.
S: INT. WANDA'S APT. DAY
N: Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding gown, Wanda sobs hysterically.
C: WANDA
D: Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me one more chance. Let me prove it! I love you! I love you, Wolf!
N: Wolf remains unmoved for a long moment. Finally he reaches out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: MS Wolf. He glances furtively at Wanda with a trace of hope still in his eyes. MS Wanda, looking off. The camera DOLLIES into her CU.
S: INT. A CHEAP HOTEL ROOM
N: This is the same hotel room from Part Two, in which we saw Nicole and Chad Palomino. At the moment Wanda and Chad lie panting in the sweat-soaked sheets.
C: WANDA
D: What I love about you, Chad, is you're not afraid of my power.
C: CHAD
D: Oh God, Wanda! I love your power. It's like an afferdesiac to me!
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: MS Wanda. She shifts slightly and glances quickly around her. Her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure. MS the Gaffer, frowning, absorbed in thought. The camera DOLLIES into a CU of him.
S: INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT. DAY
N: Suddenly, a CU of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate. A hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate to the lunch counter. Camera PANS to reveal the GAFFER sitting on the stool. He picks up the hamburger and takes a huge bite out of it. This shot holds for quite some time as he continues to chew.
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: MS The Gaffer. A hopeful, delicious smile spreading over his face. CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing twenty seconds have passed. MS Cora. She gazes serenely out before her.
S: INT. NURSING HOME. DAY
N: In the pale afternoon light, Cora stands in the middle of her drab, barren room. She appears to be staring at the door. Suddenly she begins striding toward it. Effortlessly, easily, she walks right through it.
S: INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY
N: Nick still stands at the podium with his Oscar.
C: NICK
D: In closing I'd like to say to all the people who told me not to make this movie, who wouldn't meet with me or return a simple phone call. To my favorite professor at Film School whose parting advice to me was to take a job teaching at a women's college. To Delores DelSporto, the girl I loved in high school who left me for a Jr. Varsity football player: to all these people I'd like to say thank you but I can't because what I really feel like saying is go fu --
S: INT. THE SET. DAY
N: MS Nick, his head and body jerking in a sudden spasm. He finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and the Sound man frowns hard at him. CU the Sound man's stopwatch showing twenty-five seconds have passed. The camera stays on the watch until the final five seconds have elapsed.
C: SOUND
D: And, that's a cut on room tone.
N: The room erupts with activity. Everyone moves and talks at once. Nick whispers something to Nicole then runs off.
C: WANDA
D: OK, strike the set. Props! Art Department! Redress for Scene thirty- one. Let's go! Right away people! Nick! Nick! Anyone seen Nick?!
N: WS the set. Suddenly the fake door closes right into the lens, turning the frame completely BLACK. END CREDITS. THE END
