S: INT. BLACK SITE - INTERROGATION ROOM
C: DANIEL
D: I own you, Ammar. You belong to me. Look at me. This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock.
C: DANIEL
D: If you don't look at me when I talk to you, I hurt you. If you step off this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look at me. His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks. Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching and kicking.
E: CONT'D explaining the rules
C: DANIEL
D: Look at me, Ammar. Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take part in the beating.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. BLACK SITE - LATER
N: Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties. She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first overseas assignment.
C: DANIEL
D: Are we gonna board up these windows or what?
E: to the guard
N: (TO MAYA) Just off the plane from Washington, you're rocking your best suit for your first interrogation, and then you get this guy. It's not always this intense.
C: MAYA
D: I'm fine. She's not.
C: DANIEL
D: Just so you know, it's going to take awhile. He has to learn how helpless he is. Let's get a coffee.
C: MAYA
D: No, we should go back in. Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation room.
C: DANIEL
D: You know, there's no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor. She shakes her head.
C: DANIEL
D: Alright. At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: You might want to put this on.
E: CONT'D
C: MAYA
D: You're not wearing one. Is he ever getting out?
C: DANIEL
D: Never.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
N: SUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes. Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water on the floor.
C: DANIEL
D: Right now, this is about you coming to terms with your situation. It's you and me, bro. I want you to understand that I know you, that I've been studying you for a very long time. I could have had you killed Karachi. But I let you live so you and I could talk.
N: AMMAR (RESISTANT) You beat me when my hands are tied. I won't talk to you.
C: DANIEL
D: Life isn't always fair, my friend. Did you really think that when we got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy?
C: AMMAR
D: You're a mid-level guy. You're a garbage man in a corporation. Why should I respect you?
C: DANIEL
D: And you're a money man. A paperboy! Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.
C: DANIEL
D: A disgrace to humanity!
E: CONT'D
N: (MORE)
C: DANIEL
D: You and your uncle murdered three thousand innocent people. I have your name on a five-thousand dollar transfer via Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker. He leans into Ammar's ear. Uncomfortably close.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: And you got popped with 150 kilograms of high explosives in your house!
E: CONT'D
N: AND THEN YOU DARE QUESTION ME?! And then Daniel smiles, laughs. Mercurial.
C: DANIEL
D: I'm just fucking with you. Beat. He laughs again.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: I don't want to talk about 9/11. What I want to focus on is the Saudi group. Daniel shows him a photo.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri. And I know this dude is up to some serious shit, and what I want from you is his Saudi email.
E: CONT'D
N: (PAUSE) Feel free to jump in. (PAUSE) Ammar, bro, I know that you know this dude, just give me his email...and I will give you a blanket. I will give you a blanket and some solid food. No response from Ammar. Daniel starts putting on his gloves.
C: DANIEL
D: I know that you know him.
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: I told you before, I won't talk to you.
C: DANIEL
D: Have it your way.
N: (MORE)
C: DANIEL
D: Let's go. It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel smothers Ammar's face with a towel. Ammar thrashes. Daniel considers his next move.
E: CONT'D to the masks
N: DANIEL (CONT'D) (TO MAYA) Grab the bucket. Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room, where there's an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC PITCHER.
C: DANIEL
D: Put some water in it. She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: C'mon, let's go. The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings the bucket back to Daniel. Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is now covered by a towel. Ammar thrashes with rising panic.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef, you guys met in Tunisia back in the 70s.
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: I don't know, you asshole. Maya shakes her head "no."
E: gasping for breath
C: MAYA
D: That's not credible.
N: AMMAR (SCREAMING) Why are you doing this to me?
C: DANIEL
D: You're a terrorist, that's why I'm doing it to you.
C: AMMAR
D: Fuck you. Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose.
C: DANIEL
D: I want emails of the rest of the Saudi group. Give me emails of the rest of the Saudi group! Give me one email, and I will stop this! Ammar doesn't speak. He can't.
C: DANIEL
D: Who's in the Saudi group, and what's the target? Where was the last time you saw bin Laden? WHERE WAS THE
E: CONT'D
N: LAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN? Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth: and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned. He gasps for air.
C: DANIEL
D: This is what defeat looks like, bro. Your jihad is over. Daniel stands.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: Get him up. The guards bring Ammar to his feet. Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar's face and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: Try to understand the concept here. I have time, you don't. I have other things to do, you don't.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) It's cool that you're strong. I respect it, I do. But in the end, everybody breaks, bro. It's biology. Dan and Maya exit. They've learned nothing.

N: Descending the lobby staircase with Daniel is JOSEPH BRADLEY, Chief of Station, Pakistan, a smooth, vain, sophisticated former case officer who hasn't quite buffed all the blood out of his fingernails.
C: BRADLEY
D: How did it go the other night?
C: DANIEL
D: It was good. The local cops need tactical help. But he's Tier fucking One, baby. There's your money maker.
C: BRADLEY
D: This is the guy that's KSM's nephew? What's his issue?
C: DANIEL
D: He's being a dick.
C: BRADLEY
D: If he's trying to outsmart you, tell him about your PhD.
C: DANIEL
D: I am going to have to turn up the heat. He needs to give us the Saudi group now. They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the holding area. They walk towards her as Bradley considers what Daniel is asking for.
S: INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - STAIRCASE/LOBBY
C: BRADLEY
D: He's gotta have that - given the family ties. Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss.
C: DANIEL
D: Tight with his uncle, prints all over the 9/11 money. Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in.
C: DANIEL
D: Was I lying or what? The guard opens the door and Maya comes through - not many females come through that door.
E: CONT'D to Bradley, clocking her good looks
N: DANIEL (CONT'D) (TO MAYA) Maya, this is Joseph Bradley, our illustrious station chief. (as they shake hands) Joe and I did Iraq together.
C: BRADLEY
D: And we continue our Christian mission here. Nice to meet you.
C: MAYA
D: You too, Sir.
C: BRADLEY
D: How was your flight? They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing.
C: MAYA
D: Fine.
C: DANIEL
D: She's been having a great time ever since she got in, isn't that right?
C: BRADLEY
D: How do you like Pakistan so far?
C: MAYA
D: It's kinda fucked up.
C: BRADLEY
D: You volunteered for this didn't you?
C: MAYA
D: No. Bradley smiles. He knew she didn't volunteer. They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an electronic door.
N: BRADLEY (TO MAYA) Third floor, northeast corner. She goes through and Daniel and Bradley watch her walk away.
C: DANIEL
D: Don't you think she's a little young for the hard stuff?
C: BRADLEY
D: Washington says she's a killer.
C: DANIEL
D: The children's crusade.
C: BRADLEY
D: They want the next generation on the field. Listen, I have a meeting with ISI in twenty minutes.
C: DANIEL
D: They're slow rolling us in Lahore - you might want to bitch about that.

S: INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - CONFERENCE ROOM
N: A group of thirty-somethings filing in for a meeting, chatting, comradery, taking seats around a conference table. We will get to know: JACK, mid-40s, a scruffy teddy bear, the liaison from the National Security Agency (NSA). JESSICA, 30s, an experienced targeter, and the only woman in the station who wears a skirt.
C: JACK
D: Some dude tells the Malaysian station that his nephew works with a guy who knows a guy--
C: JESSICA
D: Here we go.
C: JACK
D: Hold on - He goes to a big feast in Bangkok about a year ago. The guest of honor? Usama bin Laden. Laughter in the room.
C: JACK
D: So I say, was Tupac there too?
E: CONT'D
C: JESSICA
D: Right, but you forgot - you forgot Mullah Omar. J.J. and JEREMY, two case officers, continue the banter:
N: JEREMY (SARCASTICALLY) This is worth 5 million bucks.
C: J.J.
D: You know we're going to have to chase it down.
C: JEREMY
D: That's me, man. No job too small.
C: JACK
D: That's why I have a gift for you, my friend. Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper. Daniel and Maya enter, a little late.

D: Everyone, this is Maya. Maya, everyone.
N: (MORE)
C: DANIEL
D: Please don't ask how it's going with Ammar because she's not going to fucking tell you.
E: CONT'D
C: JESSICA
D: Ammar is withholding? Daniel nods.
C: JESSICA
D: (reading from her
E: CONT'D
C: FILE)
D: Washington assesses that Abu Faraj is officially our new number three - JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and repositions Abu Faraj's mugshot to number three in the line, two down from Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, in the background, the riffs continue -
C: DANIEL
D: - Best man for it.
C: JACK
D: London station is already asking if we think he's in contact with anyone in the U.K.
E: O.S.
C: JEREMY
D: Like we're just keeping it from them. Jessica sits back down and gets down to business.
C: JESSICA
D: The Jordanians are being really helpful with Ammar's transit papers. Jessica passes Daniel a file.
C: DANIEL
D: Any imminent threats in here?
C: JESSICA
D: They want the Consulate, the Marriott, it's low security. And they've got Majid Kahn talking about gas stations in the US.
C: DANIEL
D: And that's a conversation? Jessica shrugs. At this point, she believes that it is merely a conversation - not a fully realized plot.
C: JESSICA
D: Honestly? There are six hundred questions in there. I'd concentrate on Heathrow. The Saudis. Does it matter what Faraj thinks about Heathrow? How much latitude does he get to pick targets?
C: DANIEL
D: I think he'll give up the Saudis. But Heathrow is gonna be tough. Anyway. Anything from last night?
C: J.J.
D: Quetta base thinks they have a bead on the Arabs that escaped, and they're going to meet with the ISI this afternoon, hopefully to set up a raid down there.
C: DANIEL
D: Great.
C: JEREMY
D: And Lahore reporting ISI down there was painfully slow last night. Again. I'm beginning to think it's not incompetence.
C: DANIEL
D: I agree, I spoke to the Chief about that. Anything on bin Laden?
C: JESSICA
D: A farmer on the Afghan border near Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped pattern in the hills, tall male in the center of the diamond, flanked by four guards. It's consistent with UBL's movements.
E: reading from a cable
C: JEREMY
D: That's supposed to be his royal guard?
C: MAYA
D: That's pre-9/11 behavior. Jessica doesn't appreciate the challenge.
N: JESSICA (CHILLY) We don't have reason to believe he's changed security tactics.
C: MAYA
D: We invaded Afghanistan. That's a reason. And so the rivalry begins.
C: J.J.
D: Hey, boss, I got a guy for five thousand bucks, he can set up a taxi stand and snoop around a bit.
C: DANIEL
D: No, don't need him, the diamond sighting is bullshit. See if the Paks will send someone to talk to the farmer. Anything else? We need to be putting runs on the board against Faraj. Speak to the case officers who didn't see fit to make it today. And thank them.

S: INT. BLACK SITE - AFTERNOON
N: Daniel and the guards enter Ammar's cell with Maya. Daniel switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar.
C: DANIEL
D: Let's take it easy today, huh? Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of falafel.
C: DANIEL
D: Hungry? The food in here sucks so I got you some of this. Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking about him. The guy gets a bomb in his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable. You know him, don't you? Slowly, Ammar nods.
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: Yes.
C: DANIEL
D: I'm glad you said that. I have an email from you to him. I've had all your coms for years, bro. Who else is in your Saudi group?
C: AMMAR
D: I just handed out some cash for them. I didn't know who the guys were.
C: DANIEL
D: When you lie to me, I hurt you.
C: AMMAR
D: Please.

D: I believe you. I do, I believe you. Beat.

D: Do you want the water again, or do you want something else?
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: Please.
C: DANIEL
D: Just give me a name.
N: AMMAR
C: I DON'T--
D: Daniel jumps up.
C: AMMAR
D: I don't know. Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked guards walk to the rope pulleys.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: You see how this works? You don't mind if my female colleague sees your junk, do you? Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare nakedness.
C: DANIEL
D: Dude, you shit your pants.
E: CONT'D
N: Daniel turns to Maya -
C: DANIEL
D: You stay here, I'll be back. Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the naked, chained man. Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his eyes.
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: Your friend is an animal. Please, help me. Please. A long beat.
C: MAYA
D: You can help yourself by being truthful. The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a DOG COLLAR in his hand.
C: DANIEL
D: This is a dog collar. Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation. Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless:
C: DANIEL
D: You determine how I treat you. Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: I'm going to walk you. Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner of the room, then leans down to address his victim:
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: What the fuck do you think is going on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told me that you know. At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a large wooden box resting on a platform.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: This box sucks. I'm going to put you in it. Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out.
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: When is the attack?
E: CONT'D
N: AMMAR (VERY SOFTLY) Sunday.
C: DANIEL
D: Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday or next Sunday? Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly.
C: AMMAR
D: Monday.
C: DANIEL
D: Is it Sunday or Monday? Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach.
C: DANIEL
D: Which day is it? Partial information is treated as a lie.
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: Saturday. Beat. The masked men open the box.
C: AMMAR
D: Sunday! The guards grab Ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb. He shouts with his last reserve of energy:
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: Monday!
E: CONT'D
C: DANIEL
D: Ammar, which day?
N: AMMAR (MUMBLING) Monday, Tuesday, Beat.
C: AMMAR

C: DANIEL
D: Yeah, now.
C: JESSICA
D: You warned them - they didn't take you seriously - this is what happens. It's not on you.

E: pointing to Maya
N: AQ.
C: JESSICA
D: No, no, no. You had - what - days - brief custody - and an unresponsive ally. The way you do this is you look ahead. London. Heathrow. Mass casualties. That plan is still active.
C: MAYA
D: Ammar doesn't have a clue about what happened.
C: JESSICA
D: He knows.
C: MAYA
D: How?
C: JESSICA
D: You have to be really careful with people in KSM's circle - they're devious.
C: MAYA
D: He's not going to talk about attacks on the homeland. He's going to withhold operational details on the KSM network and probably on bin Laden. But he's been in complete isolation, he doesn't know we failed. We can tell him anything.

D: Short term memory loss is a side effect of sleep deprivation. It should come back to you. The Guards bring a prisoner to the table and remove his hood: Ammar. He stares weakly at the table.
E: PRE-LAP CONT'D
N: AMMAR (CAREFULLY) I don't know. How can I remember?
C: MAYA
D: After we kept you awake for 96 hours, you gave us names of some of your brothers and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people.
C: DANIEL
D: Which is the smart thing to do, you're starting to think for yourself. Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting.
C: DANIEL
D: Eat up! You earned it. Ammar eats.
E: CONT'D

D: So you flew via Amman to Kabul to hang out with your uncle? Mukhtar.
E: CONT'D
C: AMMAR
D: How did you know that?
C: DANIEL
D: I told you man, I know you. Alright, you got me - flight manifests. It must've been pretty fucked up for you guys after 9/11. What did you do after the invasion and before you went back to Pesh?
C: AMMAR
D: After 9/11 I had to choose: fight, to protect our turf - or run.
N: DANIEL (SYMPATHETIC) You chose to fight. Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes.
C: AMMAR
D: I wanted to kill Americans. We tried to get into Tora Bora but the bombing was too high. We couldn't cross.
C: MAYA
D: Sorry, who is the "we" in that sentence?
C: AMMAR
D: Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time.
N: DANIEL (CASUALLY) I can eat with some other dude and hook you back up to the ceiling?

D: Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and Abu Ahmed. Maya makes notes on her pad.
C: MAYA
D: Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the other guys.
C: AMMAR
D: He was a computer guy with us at the time. After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh - as you know - and he went North, I think, to Kunar.

D: Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

D: She got you there, dude.
C: AMMAR
D: I swear to you both: I don't know his family name. I would have never asked him something like that. It's not how my uncle worked. My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden. I did see him, once, about a year ago, in Karachi. He read us all a letter from the Sheikh.
C: MAYA
D: A letter?
C: DANIEL
D: What did it say? Daniel offers Ammar a smoke.

D: You and I are gonna talk about some of the guys in the training camps, yeah? The prisoner sits in a chair. He's hooded, but relaxed.
C: PRISONER
D: Ok.

D: Some of these brothers have done some bad things, and what I want to do is I want to separate them from the people like you.
C: PRISONER
D: Definitely, yeah.
C: SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
D: There was a guy called Abu Ahmed from Kuwait.
C: PRISONER
D: Yes, I remember him. A nice guy.
C: SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
D: How close was he? What was his relationship to the leadership?
C: PRISONER
D: I don't know.
C: SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
D: Did he eat with you guys - did he eat with the good guys - or did he eat with the leadership?
C: PRISONER
D: I don't know, sir. I have no idea about things like that.
C: SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
D: Yes you do, you don't need an idea

D: Mukhtar,'potato', you say 'potahto'. I say 'fucking KSM', but yeah, 'Mukhtar.' After Mukhtar was captured, what did Abu Ahmed do?
C: PRISONER
D: Abu Ahmed, I believe he went to work for The Sheikh.
S: INT. RESEARCH ROOM - LATER
N: Maya is still in the research room. She's been going at this for hours and looks fatigued. CU SCREEN: a different INTERROGATOR from the previous video; PRISONER is an older man chained to a desk. The exchange is in Arabic with an English subtitle on the screen:
C: PRISONER
D: In Karachi, in 2003 or 2004.

D: He was carrying a letter from bin Laden?

This fatherly man is HAKIM, a former political prisoner in Afghanistan and one of the CIA's most important assets. In the galley, a PRISONER is chained to a table. Hakim slides him The Photograph. The prisoner speaks in Arabic. HAKIM (TRANSLATING) He says he looks like Abu Ahmed.

D: Yeah, we don't know if Abu is on the outside of the network - part of a series of cutouts and dead drops - or if he has a direct connection to bin Laden. Does bin Laden invite him into the living room and hand him a letter directly? Or is Abu just the last guy in a long line of couriers, so that's why everybody knows him?

D: That's not all you don't know. You don't have his true name, and you don't have a clue of where he is.
C: MAYA
D: We know that he's important. The fact that everybody's heard of Abu Ahmed but nobody will tell me where he is suggests that.

Sitting alone at her desk we find Maya just as she's finishing a report. She gets up, crosses the room and goes to the desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic enthusiasm of the way Maya was six years ago. This is DEBBIE.
C: DEBBIE
D: Hi. I painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found this.
N: She hands Maya a file.
C: DEBBIE
D: It's him. He was one of ten names on a watch list sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed. They told us to watch out for him, apparently they think his whole family and extended family is bad and has ties to KSM.
E: CONT'D

D: Doesn't matter, but I wish I had that five years ago. How come I never saw it before?
C: DEBBIE
D: Nobody saw it, most likely. There was a lot of white noise after 9/11, countries wanting to help out, we got millions of tips and...
N: (SHRUGS) Things got lost in the shuffle. Human error. Maya turns her attention back to the WHITE BOARD and as Debbie keeps talking we follow Maya's gaze across the row of MUG SHOTS of Al Qaeda personnel. While a few of the men are African or are distinctive looking for other reasons, most of them look fairly similar in that they're all wearing the same type of clothes and have the same trademark long gnarly beards. DEBBIE (CONT'D) (PRESSING ON) Anyway I thought you should know about it. (PLUS) I just want to say I've heard a lot about you. You inspired me to come to Pakistan. Maya's eyes narrow.

N: MAYA (OVER SPEAKER) He was in the files this whole time. The family name is Sayeed.
C: DANIEL
D: Ok, but he's dead. So doesn't that make him a little less interesting to you?
C: MAYA O.S.
D: He may not be. We now know that Abu Ahmed is one of eight brothers. All the brothers in the family look alike. Three of them went to Afghanistan. Isn't it possible that when the three eldest brothers grew beards in Afghanistan, they started to look alike? I think the one calling himself Abu Ahmed is still alive. The picture we've been using is wrong. It's of his older brother, Habeeb. He's the one that's is dead.

D: Okay, what are you basing this on?

C: MAYA
D: We have no intercepts about Abu Ahmed dying.
N: (MORE)
C: MAYA
D: We just have a detainee who buried somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed. But if somebody as important as Abu Ahmed had died, they'd be talking about it online in chat rooms all over the place. Plus, the detainee said that Habeeb died in 2001. We know that Abu Ahmed was alive then, trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar. That means it's probably one of the other brothers that's dead.

C: INTO PHONE)
D: When can we grab lunch? He sees that Maya, who hovers annoyingly over his desk, isn't gonna wait.

S: EXT. FARTHER DOWN GRAND TRUCK ROAD/HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Squatting in the dirt near a bus stop is another OLD MAN, watching passengers disembark from a bus.

N: The Langley Predator Bay is an impressive sight, a command center bristling with high-tech equipment. The room is filled with TECHNICIANS. George is in the center, where he belongs, directing traffic. People come up and give him new pieces of information. The big screen displays a single image: The overhead satellite image of the compound in Abbottabod. SUPERIMPOSE: PREDATOR BAY - CIA HEADQUARTERS From the back of the room, Maya enters, and watches the activity unfold without her... without her input. George notices her, gives a thumbs up and then turns back to his troops. STEVE, early 40s, a senior manager and one of George's top deputies, joins Maya.
C: STEVE
D: Basically we had a guy who rolled with Al Qaeda and did services for them. We lost him for seven years and now we found him again -- and boy does he have a really nice house. Is that it?
C: MAYA
D: Pretty much.
C: STEVE
D: Okay, let's go talk to the boss.

S: INT. LANGLEY BRIEFING ROOM
N: Maya and Steve are the first to arrive in the wood panelled conference room. A detailed TABLE TOP MODEL of the compound sits in the center of the conference table, right next to a poster-sized satellite image of the compound. She starts to sit in one of the chairs. STEVE (GENTLE) You should sit back there...sorry. Steve points her to the back of the room.
C: STEVE
D: They're gonna ask: if bin Laden is at the end of this rainbow - is the Pak military with him?
E: CONT'D
C: MAYA
D: The question isn't are the Paks protecting bin Laden?'
N: (MORE)
C: MAYA
D: The question is, 'would he allow himself to be protected by the Paks?' I mean, why would he trust them? He tried to kill Musharaf. Steve considers a reply, but the meeting principals are filing in, including Daniel, and when Steve sees the CIA DIRECTOR enter the room, he clears the head of the table.
E: CONT'D
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: Go ahead.
C: STEVE
D: If you take a right out of Islamabad and drive about forty-five minutes North, you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad. A middle class community - some ex-military - not particularly interesting to us. Except we did find this compound, which is unique. We got a sixteen foot wall around the entire perimeter, the windows are blacked out. It's a fortress.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: Can't you put a camera somewhere - in the trees - to get a look into the main house?
C: GEORGE
D: It will probably be discovered.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: We have to get a look into the house. The Director moves to the satellite image.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: Alright, what's this? This cluster of buildings down here.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: The PMA - The Pakistan Military Academy. It's their West Point.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: And how close is that to the house?
C: GEORGE
D: About a mile. A WOMAN'S voice from the back of the room.
C: MAYA O.S.
D: 4,221 feet. It's closer to eight- tenths of a mile.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: Who are you?
C: MAYA
D: I'm the motherfucker that found this place, Sir. The boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the model.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: I want to know more about who's inside this house by the end of the week. The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya.

D: "Motherfucker?" Really?

N: Maya sits at her desk, frustrated, then walks down the aisle of cubicles to the glass wall of George's office. She grabs a red marker.
C: MAYA
D: Morning, George. In red magic marker, Maya writes the number 21 on the glass. Then circles it. George looks up.
E: through the glass
C: MAYA
D: Twenty-one days. It's been twenty- one days since we found the house and nothing's happened!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - PREDATOR BAY - NIGHT
N: We see a drone-fed overhead IMAGE of the bin Laden house in real time with a resolution of 100 feet. Maya stares at the screen, trying to decipher the shapes moving beneath her, thousands of miles away. The BLIPS move in increments, shadows lengthen.
T: CUT TO:

N: ECU - Maya erases the "51" on George's wall and replaces it with "52." George looks away.

N: Maya sits at her desk. Her phone rings. MAYA (INTO PHONE) Yeah?
S: INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - PREDATOR BAY
N: STEVE stares at drone image of the COMPOUND, which is under the joystick control of an IMAGERY TECHNICIAN.
C: STEVE
D: Swing by, I want to show you something.

N: Maya jumps up from her desk.
S: INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - PREDATOR BAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Maya walks in. Steve shows her images on the large monitor.
C: STEVE
D: This is from a few minutes ago. We've got two males, two females, and seven kids. Maya points to one of the shapes in the courtyard.
C: MAYA
D: Who's that?
C: STEVE
D: I'm saying that's Bushra. The brother's wife.
C: MAYA
D: How do you know the gender?
C: STEVE
D: This is a clothes-line here, for laundry. Men don't mess with the wash. We watch that shape move away from the clothes-line and back to the house.
E: points on screen, to a thin line
C: STEVE
D: It takes her about four seconds to move from there to the front door. So she's on the older side.
E: CONT'D
C: MAYA
D: What's that up there? (pointing to the other
N: SHAPES)
C: STEVE
D: Those are kids. They're shuffling around, sword-fighting or something with sticks.
N: (POINTING AGAIN) You can see their height relative to this - these are cows - so they're probably between seven and nine. Boys. Another FIGURE comes out of the house and moves to the clothes- line and grabs some laundry.
C: MAYA
D: Your female is moving fast.
C: STEVE
D: That's what I wanted to show you. (to the Imagery
C: TECHNICIAN)
D: Can we pause this please?
N: (TO MAYA) That's not the same lady. That's female #3.
C: MAYA
D: So you found two males, three females?
C: STEVE
D: That's correct. Maya suddenly gets it.

C: CONTINUOUS
D: George is on one side of a conference table, on the other side is the DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THE SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, and the
N: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.
C: GEORGE
D: If there are three females, there ought to be three males. Observant Muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands. We think there's a third family living in the house.
N: SUPERIMPOSE: SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: So this third male that you've identified as possibly being bin Laden, do I just give up all hope of ever seeing a photograph of him?
C: GEORGE
D: Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer. You give up your hope right now. We scanned for heat signatures, but we can't validate if it's a man or a woman up there. We found a safe house, but we can't get a vantage point to fire a telescope over the balcony wall.
S: EXT. COMPOUND - ABBOTTABAD - MORNING
N: A DOCTOR comes to the compound offering immunizations. One of the women let's him in, and he offers polio vaccines to the children.
C: GEORGE
D: We talked about burrowing a pin hole camera but there's a high risk of discovery.
N: (MORE)
C: GEORGE
D: We have explored the possibility of digging tunnels, of sending hot air balloons, of re-routing supply C- 130's to take a peek, but that might be too alerting. We've looked for ways of collecting available DNA from his trash - you know, looking for his toothbrush, but they burn the trash. We started a vaccination program, we sent a doctor to the house, to see if he could pull blood. A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the doctor away.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: That didn't work out. We thought about sending a guy with a bucket to pull a sample from the sewer to analyze his fecal matter.
E: CONT'D
N: SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR What was wrong with that, exactly? He looks up.
C: GEORGE
D: What was wrong with that? The sample would be too diluted.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: And it's asking too much to get a voice confirmation with him on the phone?
C: GEORGE
D: They don't make telephone calls from the compound. We pulled the cell tower nearby.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: And I'm also going to give up hope that he might ever get in that white SUV and drive around a bit and we could see him? Don't they get groceries.
C: GEORGE
D: The unidentified third male does not get groceries. He does not leave the compound. He does not present himself for photographs.
N: (MORE)
C: GEORGE
D: When he needs fresh air, he paces around beneath a grape arbor, but the leaves are so thick they obscure our satellite views. This is a professional attempt to avoid detection - real tradecraft. The only people we've seen behave this way are other top level Al Qaeda operatives. The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant who slides a big folder across his desk to George.
E: CONT'D
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: We did a Red Team on your analysis. According to them, this behavior could belong to someone other than Al Qaeda.
C: DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: They did give a forty percent chance that the unidentified third man is a senior Al Qaeda operative. But they also said there's a thirty-five percent chance he's a Saudi drug
C: DEALER
D: (reading from the
C: BINDER)
D: A fifteen percent chance that he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent chance that he's one of the relatives of the brothers.
N: SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR Basically, we agree with you, the house screams security, it screams someone who wants privacy, it even screams 'bad guy', but it does not scream bin Laden.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: You get the point.
N: (BEAT) If you can't prove it's bin Laden, at least prove it's not somebody else, like a drug dealer. Beat. The meeting is adjourned. As they walk out --
C: GEORGE
D: You know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program.
N: (BEAT) Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered up? He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: You'll think of something.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL S.C.I.F. - DAY
N: The same group around the same conference table.
C: GEORGE
D: He'd be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs. He has no internet access to the house. He makes no phone calls either in or out. Who's he selling to, who's he buying from, how's he making his money? And if you're going to say he's retired, I'd say where's his swimming pool, where's the gold cage with the falcons? And why does he send his courier to the two cities in Pakistan we most associate with Al Qaeda, that have nothing particularly to do with heroin production? The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: The President is a thoughtful, analytical guy. He needs proof.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY
N: The National Security Advisor and his team file out. George approaches.
C: GEORGE
D: I have to admit, I just don't get the rhythms of politics.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: You think this is political? If this was political we'd be having this conversation in October when there's an election bump. This is pure risk. Based on deductive reasoning, inference, supposition and the only human reporting you have is six years old, from detainees who are questioned under duress. The political move here is to tell you to go fuck yourself, and remind you that I was in the room when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq...at least there you guys brought photographs.
C: GEORGE
D: You know, you're right, I agree with everything you just said. What I meant was, a man in your position, how do you evaluate the risk of not doing something, the risk of potentially letting bin Laden slip through your fingers? George shakes his head with an "aww shucks" kind of shake.
C: GEORGE
D: That is a fascinating question. George walks away. After a beat, the National Security advisor calls after him.
E: CONT'D
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: Hey. George turns around. The National Security Advisor approaches him.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: I'm not saying we're gonna do it. But the President wants to know: if we were going to act, how would we do it? Give us options.

The doors grind open to reveal: TWO STEALTH BLACKHAWKS
C: GENERAL
D: I actually tried to kill this program a couple of times. They've gone through an initial round of testing, and they have excellent radar defeat - we just haven't tested them with people in them yet. The General continues his briefing..
C: GENERAL
D: You'll notice these stealth panels similar to what we use on the B2 - - The rotors have been muffled with decibel killers - it's slower than a Blackhawk and lacks the offense. But it can hide.
E: CONT'D pointing to the rotors
C: JUSTIN
D: Excuse me. Can I ask a question? What do we need this for in Libya? Gaddafi's anti-air is virtually non- existent. Maya looks over, not sure what to say.
C: GEORGE
D: Gentlemen, can I have your attention? My name is George. I run the Af-Pak division at CTC, and I'm primary on this for the agency. This is a title fifty operation.
N: (MORE)
C: GEORGE
D: Some of us have worked together before. This is a good one. Maya, do you want to brief them? Maya looks at the SEALs. Folds her arms. This isn't going to be easy.
E: CONT'D
C: MAYA
D: There are two narratives about the location of Osama bin Laden. This registers on the SEALs.
C: MAYA
D: The one that you're most familiar with is that UBL is hiding in a cave in the Tribal Areas, that he's surrounded by a large contingent of loyal fighters. Beat.
E: CONT'D
C: MAYA
D: But that narrative is pre- 9/11 understanding of UBL. The second narrative is that he's living in a city - living in a city with multiple points of egress and entries and with access to communications so that he can keep in touch with the organization. You can't run a global network of inter- connected cells from a cave. Beat.
E: CONT'D
C: MAYA
D: We've located an individual we believe based on detainee reporting is bin Laden's courier. He's living in a house in Abbottabod, Pakistan. And we assess that one of the other occupants of the house is UBL.
E: CONT'D
C: JUSTIN
D: Excuse me. You got an intel source on the ground?
C: MAYA
D: No.
C: JUSTIN
D: No? Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden? We've been on this op before, you know.
C: MAYA
D: Bin Laden uses a courier to interact with the outside world. By locating the courier, we've located bin Laden.
C: PATRICK
D: That's really the intel? That's it?
C: MAYA
D: Quite frankly, I didn't even want to use you guys, with your dip and your velcro and all your gear bullshit. I wanted to drop a bomb but people didn't believe in this lead enough to drop a bomb, so they're using you guys as canaries on the theory that if bin Laden isn't there, you can sneak away and no one will be the wiser.
N: (BEAT) But bin Laden is there - and you're going to kill him for me. PATRICK (SOFTENING) Bullets are cheap.

C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: I'm about to go look the President in the eye and what I'd like to know, no fucking bullshit, is where everyone stands on this thing. Now, very simply. Is he there or is he not fucking there? He looks to the Deputy Director.
C: DEPUTY DIRECTOR
D: We all come at this through the filter of our own past experiences. I remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I fronted that and I can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: Yes or no.
C: DEPUTY DIRECTOR
D: We don't deal in certainty, we deal in probability. I'd say there's a sixty percent probability he's there. The CIA Director points to Wolf.
C: WOLF
D: I concur. Sixty percent.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC is what convinces me.
C: CIA DIRECTOR
D: You guys ever agree on anything?
C: DANIEL
D: Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing this mostly on detainee reporting and I spent a bunch of time in those rooms - who knows? Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor.
C: DANIEL
D: I'd say it's a soft sixty, sir. I'm virtually certain there's some high value target there, I'm just not sure it's bin Laden. The CIA Director leans back in his chair.

C: PILOT
D: Three mikes to target. Standby for doors open. Inside the dim interior, illuminated by only blinking instrumentation, the men are tense, quiet. We pass slowly from face to face, noting each SEAL's contemplation of the mission that lies ahead. Some of them are anonymous soldiers. Many we've come to know: Justin, joyfully bobbing his head, grooving to his iPod... Saber's eyes fixed on a thousand-yard stare... Hakim struggles to get comfortable and control his anxiety, wipes away sweat... Patrick checks his gear for the hundredth time.
C: CO-PILOT
D: Two minutes.
S: EXT. STEALTH BLACKHAWKS - PRINCE 51 AND PRINCE 52 -
N: Outside: Darkness....just a THUMP THUMP THUMP... And then we see them: flying in tight formation, the oddly rectangular helos, with their black stealth panels and sharp edges, like two alien spaceships advancing.
S: INT. EXT STEALTH BLACKHAWK - NIGHT
N: PILOT (OVER INTERCOM) Should be coming up just off our nose, 3 o'clock. Everyone grabs onto their gear, getting ready to fast rope.

S: EXT. ABBOTTABAD, PAKISTAN - NIGHT
N: Small cottages mixed in with larger suburban homes. Among them, swimming pools. The water shimmering. Surreal. Then: rows of green fields. A stand of trees. It appears: AC 1. It is massive - six or seven times larger than any other nearby structure - with sixteen foot high walls and a gated interior. A fortress.

T: Cross cutting all that follows:
N: - At thirty feet above the ground the helicopter begins to shudder and lose stability. Instead of descending in a straight path, the bird drifts sideways
C: PATRICK
D: Hey! Slide right. - Then lurches down, falling to within 15 feet of the swirling ground, rotors churning the dust, creating near BROWNOUT conditions, a dust hurricane
E: shouting to pilot

S: EXT. HELO CRASH
N: The dust settles to reveal...a twisted wreck. PRINCE 51 has crash landed into a precarious position, with the back half of the helicopter wedged into the top of the wall and the front of it in the ground, leaving the passengers inside suspended more then ten feet off the ground.
S: INT./EXT. PRINCE 51
N: Although he's wearing a heavy pack and carrying gear, Patrick jumps down, landing with a knee-shattering combat roll. Several SEALs follow him.
S: EXT. INNER COURTYARD

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COMPOUND - FIRST GATE
N: Patrick, Justin and SIX other SEALs cluster near the First Gate in the animal pen. One of the SEALs places a charge on the gate, while others check the Prayer Room. Boom! The charge partially blows open the metal swing doors of the gate, leaving a very narrow gap. Not ideal. The SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of the prayer room.
S: EXT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Patrick and Jared arrive at the guest house but can't see inside - the windows and doors are covered with sheets. Patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle when the door erupts with gunfire - Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house, putting a dozen rounds inside. A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle unlocks. ABU AHMED'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks out.
C: JARED
D: Ir-fah ee-dek!
N: ABU AHMED'S WIFE (IN ENGLISH) You killed him.

COMMANDING OFFICER (INTO RADIO) Negative. I'm internal, I'll let you in. The Commanding Officer opens the gate and the other SEALs walk inside. As a group, they move towards the main house, arriving at the South side front door. The door is open and they enter -
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights, the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway. Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes, greet them like the innards of a haunted house. One of the SEAL's catches movement: A figure with an AK-47 scrambling through clutter, then disappearing around a corner.
C: JUSTIN
D: Abrar! The figure, Abu Ahmed's brother, ABRAR, re-appears at the end of the hallway. He pokes his head out -
N: - And is shot by Justin. He falls out of view, whimpering in pain.

She falls...Abrar is underneath her - he is still breathing, gasping and - Justin shoots him again, silencing him - Then looks to his wife and assesses her condition - Badly wounded, faint breathing, life fading from her eyes... - Justin turns away
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Justin and a BREACHER proceed down the hall to the heavy gate that blocks access to the stairway while another SEAL stays behind. Somewhere, children are screaming.
C: JUSTIN
D: Shut those fucking kids up. O.S. the kids quiet down.
C: JUSTIN
D: Talk to me.
E: CONT'D
C: BREACHER
D: There's no fucking way we want to blow this thing. The gate is solid.
N: MIKE (O.S.) (OVER RADIO) This is Echo 11 - we're at our primary set point, prepping to breach. JUSTIN (INTO RADIO) Wait, Echo 11 - we're internal on the south side - this is a negative breach. MIKE (OVER RADIO) Roger. We're ready to make our entry out here. JUSTIN (INTO RADIO) Roger that, we're coming to meet you. (to the Breacher) Stay with these kids. Don't let them in the back room.

S: EXT. MAIN HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER
N: In the regrouping that occurs on the side of the main house, Justin and Patrick find themselves side by side - and the old friends take a moment to reconnect while the rest of the team places charges and prepares for the next phase of the assault. PATRICK (QUIETLY) You good?
C: JUSTIN
D: Yeah. I forgot...were we supposed to crash that helo? Patrick allows himself a smile.
C: PATRICK
D: Ibrahim tried to shoot me through the door. I popped him from the outside.

N: The SEALs reach the staircase, which is sealed off by a separate metal gate than the one inside the hallway.
C: SEAL
D: Breacher up. A charge is prepared. Justin, who is now inside one of the side rooms, sees Jared standing close to the door.
C: JUSTIN
D: Hey man, move! Jared moves just as -

N: SABER (CONT'D) KHALED!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
N: Khaled hears his name being called from below. A few feet away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded AK-47. He goes to the gun and picks it up. He hears his name again, "Khaled!" And the voice sounds friendly, urgent. Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and heads back to the sound of his name. Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the stairway and fires - killing him instantly. Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb the staircase leading to the third floor.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COMPOUND - STREET
N: The neighborhood, awakened by the crash and gunfire, stirs to life. Hakim and the SEALs notice LIGHTS flipping on. And down the block, a group of several young men appear on a roof.

N: Justin opens a file cabinet, stuffed with documents.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE SECOND TO THIRD FLOOR STAIRWAY

C: SABER
D: Osama!? A man appears at the end of the third floor hallway. -- Ssssht ! a bullet strikes him in the head - knocking him back into a bedroom - Saber fires again, missing - And proceeds down the hallway, going full speed now, Patrick right behind him, sprinting into the bedroom
E: CONT'D
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE OSAMA'S LIVING QUARTERS
N: Two women stand at the entrance of the room. Saber rushes them and with a football tackle, slams them into the wall. Patrick enters the room and fires several rounds into the man on the floor. PATRICK (INTO RADIO) Possible jackpot. The women Saber is restraining are wailing, struggling to get to their husband, as a ten year-old boy rushes up to the body. Patrick pushes him away and kneels down to get a better look at the body. PATRICK (CONT'D) (TO SABER) Dude, do you realize what you just did?

N: The EOD SEAL slides into the belly of Prince 51. While he places charges, another SEAL climbs up to affix charges to the roof and rotors ...and like a tight roper, he walks out on the tail of the helicopter, when suddenly his foot slips, piercing the tail's thin skin, and he nearly falls off. He manages to place a last charge - but the remainder of the tail piece will not be detonated.
S: EXT. COMPOUND - POTATO FIELD

Seven years telescoping to this moment. The end of a journey. She stares at the body for a moment then turns to look across the room where ADMIRAL MCRAVEN meets her eye. She nods. ADMIRAL MCRAVEN (INTO PHONE) Sir, the agency expert gave a visual confirmation. Yes, Sir, the girl. Hundred percent.
