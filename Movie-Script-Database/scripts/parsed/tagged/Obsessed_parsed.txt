The driver's door opens and DEREK CHARLES steps out, a handsome and likable African-American in his early 30's; a guy who's fought hard to make himself a success in business and life. Derek wears a business suit and the first thing he does is cross the lawn to the SOLD sign. With a new homeowner's look of satisfaction, Derek grips the SOLD sign and pulls it out of the ground.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Derek?
N: D erek looks over to where his pretty wife BETH is standing beside the SUV, holding their cute 2 year old son KYLE in her arms. Beth shakes her head with amusement.

D: This is coming down.
C: DEREK'S VOICE

E: PLAYFUL
C: BETH
D: And what do you suggest we use for a bed?
C: DEREK
D: What do we need a bed for when we've got a fine shag carpet?
C: BETH
D: Because I'm gonna have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my --
E: LAUGHS

E: nuzzling her neck
C: BETH
D: What about...
C: DEREK
D: Kyle? That boy wouldn't wake up if a nuclear bomb went off.
C: BETH
D: Maybe not, but the movers...
C: DEREK
D: Won't be here for another hour.
N: Beth smiles, giving in. They look up at themselves in the mirror like naughty teenagers.

S: INT. YUKON - DAY
N: Picture of Beth and Kyle smiling at him from the dash, Derek drives the freeway toward the skyscrapers of downtown. He listens to the stock and financial report. Then, switches over to CD and Gnarls Barkley's "Gone Daddy Gone" blares out. The two sides of Derek Charles. C UT TO:

The doors shut and the car ascends. t other floors, people get on and off until it's just Derek and one other passenger: LISA SHERIDAN, balancing an arm load of thick files. She's in her mid-20's, white, beautiful, glasses and hair pulled back projecting an efficient, smart and sophisticated look; simple blouse and skirt, high heels, great legs. Lisa glances over at Derek, intrigued.
C: ISA
D: Gage/Bendix?
N: Derek looks up from his paper with a distracted smile.

C: LISA
D: I thought you might.
C: DEREK

C: LISA
D: Just here for the day.
C: DEREK
D: Well, you could have fooled me.
N: Lisa shifts on her feet.
C: LISA
D: I'm beginning to think these heels were a big mistake.
N: Derek glances down at her shapely legs. LISA (cont'd) I should have worn my track shoes. They've got me running all over town picking up these disclosure -- That's when the pile in her arms slides south. The files fall to the floor and spread out in a mess. Lisa LAUGHS and drops to her knees. LISA (cont'd) God, I'm such a klutz. Derek bends down to help. Their hands touch briefly.
C: DEREK
D: No problem. Happen to anybody.
N: They straighten up, look at each other. he door slides open, revealing the sleek and vast offices of GAGE BENDIX, ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT.
C: ISA
D: Thanks. I owe you one.
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS Derek through a warren of cubicles where STAFF WORKERS attend phones and computers. He becomes aware that Lisa is right behind him.
C: DEREK
D: Are you following me?
E: with humor
C: LISA
D: No. I'm taking these files to Mister Charles' office. They said it was this way.
C: DEREK
D: Derek Charles?
C: LISA
D: I guess you probably know him.
C: DEREK
D: Oh, yeah, I know him. Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don't tell him I said that. L
E: lowers his voice
C: ISA
D: I could get you into trouble?
C: DEREK
D: Deep trouble.
N: Approaching a desk where Derek's assistant, a mild-looking man in his late 30's named PATRICK looks up and smiles. Across from Patrick is another desk and another assistant, a middle-aged woman named MARGE.
C: ATRICK
D: Morning, Derek. How's the new house?
C: DEREK
D: Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up.
C: PATRICK
D: Beth must have loved that.
C: DEREK
D: If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell her I'm in a meeting.
C: PATRICK
D: Remember who used to sit at this desk? She'll know I am lying.
C: DEREK
D: Good point.
E: with a smile
N: Patrick CHUCKLES as Derek enters his office and vanishes inside. Patrick notices Lisa standing there with her arm load of files.

E: to Lisa
N: Lisa stares at Derek's office.
C: LISA
D: That's Derek Charles?
C: PATRICK

E: dramatic sigh
T: CUT TO:

C: AGE
D: Did you talk to our German friend, Herr Ganz?
E: to Derek
C: DEREK
D: Matter of fact, I just got off the line to Berlin.
C: GAGE
D: And?
C: DEREK
D: Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock Market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest.
C: AGE
D: You think he's right?
C: DEREK
D: Hell, no. I think he's a hundred percent wrong. We haven't even gotten close to that point yet. Hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance. You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream. He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead... to the tune of 155 mil.
C: AGE
D: I knew there was a reason I promoted you. No offense, Ben.
E: PLEASED
C: BEN
D: None taken, Joe. I'm just honored to be allowed to exist in Derek's world.
N: Derek looks over at Ben who winks at him. They're friends and good-natured ribbing is part of their relationship.
C: GAGE
D: Good. I want you to throw Derek all your support on this one. hat's when Lisa walks by on the other side of the glass. Gage perks up.
N: GAGE (cont'd) Whose legs are those?
C: BEN
D: Never seen `em before.
C: DEREK
D: I think she's one of the temps.
C: BEN
D: You mean temptress...
C: GAGE
D: Remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her. Doesn't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office, does it, boys?
N: Ben agrees. Derek merely nods. He's not comfortable with this tone of sexism.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OFFICE - EVENING
N: End of the day. Workers are leaving. Derek passes an open office door. Ben sticks his head out.
C: BEN
D: I scored an extra Lakers ticket for tomorrow night. Think you can get free?
C: DEREK
D: I'm moving into a new house.
C: EN
D: So?
C: DEREK
D: Do I look like a man who wants a divorce?
C: EN
D: I could call and say it's a work emergency.
C: DEREK
D: Thanks, but I think I'll stay married instead.
C: BEN
D: Coward.
E: LAUGHS
N: Ben ducks back into his office. Derek walks past a cubicle on their way to the elevator.
C: LISA
D: Good night, Mister Charles.
N: Derek stops, turns and sees Lisa sitting at a computer station. She smiles. L ISA (cont'd) You punk'd me.
C: DEREK
D: Sorry but you set me up.
E: LAUGHS
C: LISA
D: Don't worry. I'll get my revenge. And by the way, you might like to know everybody who works here strongly disagrees with you.
E: with humor
C: DEREK
D: About what?
C: LISA
D: About Derek Charles being an asshole. They all say he's the nicest guy in the firm.
C: DEREK
D: Well, that just proves he's got `em all fooled.
C: LISA
D: And he's humble, too. I'm Lisa, by the way. Lisa Sheridan.
C: DEREK
D: Well, it was nice to meet you, Lisa Sheridan. Good luck with your next job --
N: erek continues on to the elevator. Lisa calls after him:
C: LISA
D: Actually, they're keeping me on a few more days, so I'll probably see you on Monday.
N: Can't tell if he heard. Lisa watches him go out of sight, then, curious, she turns to her computer and pulls up Derek's bio and picture on the company web site: "Derek Charles graduated from UCLA with a major in finance. Began his career with major Wall Street Brokerage firm before joining Gage/Bendix working with clients to help them accomplish their investment objectives. From asset allocation and investment planning, pension analysis, etc." UT TO:
S: INT. CHARLES HOUSE - KYLE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kyle is asleep in his crib. Derek and Beth look down on him, smiling, then move quietly toward the door. Before they can sneak out, Kyle lets out A CRY. They look at each other.
C: DEREK
D: Damn. Almost made it.
C: BETH
D: Your turn.
N: erek returns to the crib and picks up Kyle.
C: DEREK
D: Hey, little man. What's wrong? You should be... Uh oh. Poopy diaper. Beth...

D: Whew. What's that woman been feeding you?
N: UT TO:
S: EXT. CHARLES HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Derek and Beth sit at a table on the outside deck that overhangs a sheer drop to the canyon below. In the distance, the LA basin sparkles like a diamond in the night. Derek and Beth are happy but exhausted. In front of them is an empty pizza box. Derek picks up a bottle of champagne and pours some for Beth and himself. They're both a little drunk.
C: BETH
D: Well, we toasted the house --
C: DEREK
D: Toasted Kyle --
C: BETH
D: Your promotion --
C: DEREK
D: But I've saved the most important toast for last... To my beautiful wife who I love and adore more than anything in the world.
E: raising his glass
C: BETH
D: And to my handsome husband. I asked for the moon and he gave me the stars.
N: hey clink glasses and drink. BETH (cont'd) Derek...
C: DEREK
D: Uh huh?
E: YAWNS
C: BETH
D: How would you feel about trying out that mirror again? This time in our own bed.
C: DEREK
D: Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test drive?
E: perks up
C: BETH
D: You know how I like looking at your sexy butt.
C: DEREK
D: Beth, you are so bad.
E: LAUGHS
C: BETH
D: Isn't that WHY you married ME?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OFFICE - MORNING
N: Derek arrives to find Lisa sitting at his outer desk in Patrick's place. She looks up and smiles. She's not wearing her glasses and her hair is down giving her a softer, less severe look.
C: LISA
D: Hi. Remember me?
C: DEREK
D: Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp. Where's Patrick?
C: LISA
D: Out with the flu. I did some trading with the other temps and wrangled your desk. I hope that's okay.
C: EREK
D: Uh... sure.
N: Looking over at the assistant outside the other corner office. DEREK (cont'd) Hey Marge.
C: MARGE

S: INT. DEREK'S OFFICE

C: LISA
D: I put a memo on your desk about the Christmas party this Friday.
C: EREK
D: Is it that time already?
N: Derek picks up the memo and scans it.
C: LISA
D: Why don't they invite spouses?
C: DEREK
D: How's that?
C: LISA
D: To the Christmas party. It says "for employees only."
C: DEREK
D: It's like that in most companies. They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is about.
C: LISA
D: So, does this party get pretty wild?
C: DEREK
D: Just the opposite.
C: LISA
D: Well that's no fun.
N: Derek notices a container of Starbucks coffee. LISA (cont'd) called Patrick. He said you like it black with two sugars. Derek is impressed. He opens the container. LISA (cont'd) If it's cold, I can run down and nuke it in the Break Room.
C: DEREK
D: No, it's perfect.
E: takes a sip
N: Lisa is pleased. She raises her pad and pencil.
C: LISA
D: Fire away.
C: DEREK
D: Well, it's Monday and first thing on Monday...
C: LISA
D: I took care of that.
C: DEREK
D: Took care of what?
C: LISA
D: On Mondays you always send your wife a dozen long-stemmed red roses. I called to confirm they've been delivered.
E: off Derek's look of surprise
C: DEREK
D: Thanks.
C: LISA
D: I think that's incredibly sweet. How long have you two been married?
C: DEREK
D: Three years in March.
C: LISA
D: And you still send her flowers every Monday morning? Lucky girl.
C: DEREK
D: It's kind of a tradition.
C: LISA
D: Patrick said you started sending them back when Beth worked here as your assistant. Is that how you won her heart?
C: DEREK
D: Well, it took a little more than roses. We need to run some calls.
E: getting down to business
C: LISA
D: Ready when you are.
E: POISED
C: DEREK AMUSED)
D: Are you always this efficient?
C: LISA
D: Does that surprise you?
C: DEREK
D: Well, it's just that most of the temps we get here...
C: LISA
D: I think you'll find I'm not your typical temp.
C: DEREK
D: No. Definitely not. Okay not your typical temp... start with Phil Trendle at Emerson... set up a lunch for end of the week. Wherever he wants but push the Water Grill. Then Terry Mills at Imagio. Am I going too fast for you?
E: THEN
C: LISA
D: No. Go faster. I can handle it.

C: DEREK
D: I don't know. It's shaping up to be a work weekend.
N: Outside, at her desk, Lisa eavesdrops on her headset, listening with interest.
C: BETH
D: You can work at home and then we'll go to the barbecue. s Beth chats on, Derek gets a weird feeling. Still on the phone, he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to the door. He looks out, expecting to catch Lisa listening in. Instead, she's not at her desk. She's standing several feet away at a file cabinet. She turns and smiles at him.
C: LISA
D: Do you need me?
N: Derek shakes his head no and steps back into his office.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

C: EREK
D: Betty?
C: BETH
D: Your other wife? Yeah. Who's Betty?

C: BETH
D: That guy she was seeing, the one we met at Thanksgiving... Jack.
C: EREK
D: The one she said was perfect.
C: BETH
D: Apparently he's not so perfect. He told her he just wants to be FWB.
C: DEREK
D: FWB?
C: BETH
D: Friends With Benefits.
C: DEREK
D: What does that mean?
C: BETH
D: You know. Sex but no commitments.
C: DEREK
D: And Sheila's got a problem with that?

N: Lisa comes over. Kyle presses shyly against Derek. LISA (cont'd) Hi, Kyle. I'm Lisa. When Kyle doesn't respond...
C: DEREK
D: Kyle, say hello.
C: BETH
D: He can say hello. He's usually not this shy around strangers.
C: LISA
D: What a handsome boy. He looks just like you.
E: to Derek

D: Actually, most people think he takes after Beth.
C: LISA
D: Talk about the perfect family. The three of you should be on a magazine cover.

C: DEREK

C: BETH
D: She knew I was taking Kyle to Santa.
C: DEREK
D: So?
C: BETH
D: So she was obviously listening at the door.
C: DEREK
D: Well, she probably didn't know when to come in.
C: BETH
D: I thought you said she was plain. Derek, that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain.

C: DEREK
D: How could I forget? I had a hangover for a week after.
C: BETH
D: Any women coming this year?
C: DEREK
D: No, just the usual suspects. Joe says it's going to be a male bonding experience.
C: BETH
D: I can just picture you guys in the hotel jacuzzi, getting in touch with your innermost feelings.
C: DEREK
D: Hopefully, they'll all get drunk and crash early. Or if I'm really lucky... drown in the jacuzzi.
E: zips up his bag
C: BETH
D: Call me tonight.
C: DEREK
D: I will.
N: erek gives her a kiss. Their image is reflected in the overhead mirror.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT
N: A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers drinks to Derek, Joe Gage, Ben Talbot and THREE OTHER MEN smoking cigars and relaxing after dinner. The mood is rowdy. They're all a little toasted. A drink is put in front of Derek.
C: DEREK
D: I didn't order this.
N: The Cocktail Waitress leans down and WHISPERS in his ear:
C: WAITRESS
D: It's from the lady at the bar. erek turns and peers at the crowded bar area. He catches a flash of a young woman in a tight dress seated on a stool. But a crowd of people move into his line of vision and when they clear, the woman is gone.
N: Derek tenses.
C: JOE
D: Derek, you okay?
C: DEREK
D: I'm fine. Just thought I saw somebody.
C: JOE
D: Somebody you know? Or somebody you'd like to know?
N: The other guys chortle.
C: BEN
D: No way. You can't tempt this guy.
C: OE
D: Who could blame him with a wife like Beth.
C: DEREK
D: Speaking of Beth, I said I'd give her a call before she puts Kyle to bed. I'll be right back.
N: Derek picks up his drink and leaves.
C: JOE
D: Hurry back. This party's just getting started.
S: EXT. PATIO OUTSIDE THE BAR
N: Low-lit. Empty. Derek comes out, flips open his cell to call home. He puts his drink down on a table.
C: DEREK
D: Hey, honey. It's me.
N: INTERCUTTING WITH BETH in Kyle's bedroom, putting him to sleep.
C: BETH
D: How's the male bonding?
C: DEREK
D: They're all getting wasted. Any minute now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi.
C: BETH
D: Well, if your future depends on putting on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks... Derek? You there?
N: Derek freezes. Across the patio, he sees A FIGURE slowly approaching. It's a woman back-lit, a silhouette. But as she passes into the light from the bar, she's revealed as Lisa, transformed into an alluring femme fatale.
C: EREK
D: I have to go.
C: BETH
D: Wait. Kyle wants to say good night.
C: DEREK
D: They're yelling for me to come back.
E: TENSE
C: BETH
D: It'll just take a second...
N: Beth picks up Kyle. BETH (cont'd) Say good night to Daddy. As Lisa comes closer...
C: DEREK
D: Beth, I'll call you later.
E: DESPERATE
C: BETH
D: I'll be in bed -- Derek?
N: Derek clicks off and pockets his cell. On the other end, Beth looks perturbed. Now Lisa comes face to face with Derek, smiling. She boldly picks up his drink and takes a sip.
C: LISA
D: I can always tell from the pained look on your face when you're talking to Beth.
C: DEREK
D: How did you know I'd be here?
E: DEMANDING
C: LISA
D: I've got my sources. slight frown) What's wrong? You don't look happy to see me.
C: DEREK
D: Why did you come here?
C: LISA
D: You said you could never be with someone you work with. (when he doesn't seem to "get
C: IT")
D: That's why I quit. So we could be together.
N: Derek looks at her, astounded.
C: DEREK
D: Lisa, you need to leave.
E: holding down panic
C: LISA
D: Or what? You'll make a scene?
E: teasing smile MORE
N: LISA(cont'd) Call security? What would Joe and Ben and the others think? I'll tell you what they'd think. They'd think we arranged it. And in a way, we did. Lisa turns aside. Out of Derek's sight, she slips a capsule into his drink, then puts it back on the table. LISA (cont'd) This hook-up was on the books from the day we met.
C: EREK
D: What are you talking about?
C: LISA
D: One of us has to take control and I guess it's me. So you go back, say your good nights to the boys and I'll be waiting in my room. 610.
C: DEREK
D: I'm not coming to your room.
C: LISA
D: Would you rather I came to yours?
C: DEREK
D: You're crazy... sick. You need help.
C: LISA
D: I know. I need help. Help me, Derek.
E: moves closer; seductive
N: She presses against him.
C: DEREK
D: Stay away from me!
N: Lisa emits a musical little laugh and smooths her dress. She registers Derek's angry face and clenched fists. She smiles.
C: LISA
D: All right, Derek. You play your games... ... and I'll play mine.
E: turning away
N: Lisa disappears into the darkness, high heels echoing. Derek feel his cell phone vibrate. He pulls it out.
C: DEREK
D: Beth, I'm sorry --
C: BEN'S VOICE
D: Beth? It's Ben. Where the hell are you, bro?
C: EREK
D: I'm right here. Coming back in.
N: Agitated, Derek picks up his drink, downs it and re-enters the bar.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: After midnight. erek and Ben get off the elevator. Ben is slightly drunk but Derek is farther gone -- wobbly on his feet, bleary.
C: BEN
D: Come on, it's early. We'll go to my room and plunder the mini-bar, charge it all to Joe. D
C: EREK
D: Can't, man. That last drink totally kicked my ass. I need to lie down.
C: BEN
D: All right, be that way. But don't forget. Nine o'clock in the California Room. Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.
N: Ben goes one way, Derek the other. Derek, feeling more and more disoriented, makes his way to his room. He fishes around in his pockets and finds his key card. He slides it and pushes open the door.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM
N: Derek lets himself in, doesn't even click on the lights. There's enough moonlight coming through the window to lead him to the bed where he flops down on his back. He doesn't even bother to undress. Derek closes his eyes, then opens them. He feels sick. Sound and perception are playing games with his head. The room begins to spin and he can hear a sound, a rushing noise. Is it the shower in the bathroom? The bathroom door is shut but there's a crack of light around the edges. Is someone in there? Derek is too out of it to care. He just wants to sleep, make it go away. He closes his eyes, begins to drift off. The bathroom door opens, letting in a cloud of steam and a shaft of light. A woman's silhouette appears, naked. She moves to the bed. erek feels the bed move... feels a tug on his trousers... then, an amplified ZZZZIIIPPP. Derek's eyes open in shock. He can't believe what he sees -- Lisa, naked, straddling him. Her hand caressing his face. It's like a dream. A nightmare. Lisa smiles seductively and puts a finger to her lips.
C: LISA
D: Shhhhh.
C: DEREK
D: No..
E: groggy; can barely get the word out
C: LISA
D: Hush, baby.
N: Her voice seems distorted like it's coming from another world. LISA (cont'd) I'm going to take real good care of you. Derek tries to resist but finds he has no control over his body or mind. All he can see is a shifting, distorted image of Lisa's face... her smile... her teeth.. her lips... the blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes. And somewhere in those eyes he can see HIMSELF. And that's the last thing Derek sees before he passes out and the entire world goes black and silent. C UT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING
N: Dazzling sunlight. Derek wakes up, startled by a pounding on the door.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Housekeeping!
N: Derek blinks, blinded by the sun. His brain is fogged and he's disoriented. It takes him a moment to realize where he is. A hotel room. Naked under the covers. How did he... WOMAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Housekeeping! The door begins to open.
C: DEREK
D: Later! Come back later!
E: SHOUTING
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Okay. I come back.
N: The door closes. erek glances over at the clock. 10:15. Shit. He's overslept and now he's late for the seminar. Derek starts to get up, looks over and -- his heart stops. There's Lisa sprawled beside him on her stomach, naked under the covers. She opens her eyes and gives him a sexy, sleepy smile, stretching her body like a cat.
C: LISA
D: Morning.
N: Derek goes into panic mode, jumping out of the bed like it's on fire.
C: DEREK
D: You've got to get out of here!
C: LISA
D: What are you talking about?
C: DEREK
D: Leave! You've got to go!
N: Derek grabs Lisa by the arm, drags her out of the bed at the same time gathering her clothes from the floor and thrusting them into her arms.
C: LISA
D: Derek, come on...
C: EREK
D: I want you out of here!
C: LISA
D: Why? You worried somebody's gonna catch us?
C: DEREK
D: Just get the hell out.
C: LISA
D: We woke up a little grumpy this morning, didn't we?
E: HALF-AMUSED
N: Lisa barely manages to slip into her dress before Derek opens the door and pushes her out into the hall. ISA (cont'd) Derek, what is wrong with you? Derek slams the door. On the other side, we hear Lisa's musical laugh. LISA (cont'd) All right. Have it your way. Derek locks the door. Shaking, he goes to the bed, sits on the edge and buries his throbbing head in his hands.
C: DEREK
D: Fuck... fuck... fuck.
E: in hell
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL - SEMINAR ROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: Derek slips in and takes a seat next to Ben at the end of a big table. The other guys are there, also a little under the weather. They take notice of his late arrival.
C: JOE
D: Thank god. We were about to send out a search party.
E: interrupting his talk
C: DEREK
D: Sorry. Overslept.
N: Derek glances over at Ben who frowns at him. Derek looks over at the wall clock as Joe resumes talking. 10:35.
T: IME CUT
N: It's now 12:50. While Joe continues his talk, A HOTEL CLERK quietly slips into the room, goes over to Derek and whispers to him. Derek perks up with concern. He leans over to Ben, WHISPERS: DEREK (cont'd) It's Beth.
C: BEN
D: What about her?
C: DEREK
D: She's here.
C: MYSTIFIED)
D: I'll be right back.
N: Derek gets up and leaves. NT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE Derek follows the Clerk. As they turn a corner...
C: CLERK
D: Here's your wife, sir.
N: Derek stops dead. It's not Beth waiting for him. It's Lisa, dressed sexy/casual, bright smile. The Clerk goes away.
C: LISA
D: I thought you might need an excuse to get out of there. How about some lunch?
C: DEREK
D: Lunch?
C: LISA
D: It's gorgeous outside and I made a reservation at --
N: Derek grabs her by the elbow and hustles her out of sight, trying to keep his voice down.
C: DEREK
D: What do you think this is?
C: LISA
D: The morning after?
C: DEREK
D: We didn't do anything last night.
E: FLARING
N: Lisa gives him a sly smile.
C: LISA
D: But you can't remember, can you?
C: DEREK
D: It didn't happen!
C: LISA
D: Derek, not so loud. You'll cause a scene.
C: DEREK
D: That's exactly what we Right. A scene. need.
N: Derek hauls her roughly back down the hall.
C: LISA
D: What are you doing?
C: DEREK
D: What I should have done last night. Taking you inside to tell Joe and the others whatever you want. They'll know you're out of your mind. e yanks her toward the door.
C: LISA
D: Why are you trying to ruin this?
E: trying to pull away
C: EREK
D: THERE IS NO THIS!!!
C: LISA
D: Don't say that.
C: DEREK
D: Godammit!
N: Derek throws her roughly against the wall. She hits her head, a little stunned. Derek steps back, surprised by his own violence. DEREK (cont'd) I'm sorry...
C: LISA
D: What's wrong with you? You're acting like a stranger.
C: DEREK
D: Yeah! That's exactly what I am. A stranger, a person you don't know. Now either go inside and tell them your bullshit lies or get the hell out of here.
C: LISA
D: You think you can use me, then throw me away? I'm not some piece of garbage, Derek. I'm a human being...
E: flaring; ugly tone
N: Lisa reaches out to him. Derek, in frustration, raises his hand as if to strike her. Her eyes flash with excitement. Derek stops himself, revolted by his own behavior. LISA (cont'd) Do it. Hit me. You can do anything you want to me. Don't you know that? Anything. Derek stares at her like she's a thing, an object. He shakes his head. ISA (cont'd) Don't look at me that way.
C: DEREK
D: How else do you look at somebody who sickens and repulses you?
C: ISA
D: Derek, please...
C: DEREK
D: I don't care what you do or what you say. What goes on in that twisted mind of yours. It doesn't matter because the truth is, there's never going to be anything between us. So go ahead, Lisa... do your worst.
N: They stare at each other. Then, Derek turns and goes into the seminar room, closing the door behind him. With a heartbreaking expression of hurt, Lisa stares at the door for a long moment, wipes a tear from her face and walks away.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT
N: Derek, Ben, Joe and the others eat dinner. A lively atmosphere. Derek seems apart from the others, lost in thought.
C: BEN
D: Derek, you drinking?
C: DEREK
D: Not tonight, man. I'm sticking to ice tea.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ELEVATOR/HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER THAT DAY
N: Derek gets off on his floor and heads to his room.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM
N: Derek steps inside and freezes, confronted with his worst nightmare. High heels and a path of discarded clothing leads to the bed where Lisa lies in bed, naked under the covers, her eyes shut, seemingly asleep.
C: EREK
D: No. No fucking way...
E: anger rising
N: Derek moves toward the bed and the sleeping girl. EREK (cont'd) Goddamn it, Lisa. No response. Her head is cocked to one side and her skin is ghostly pale. Derek leans over and shakes Lisa's naked shoulder. DEREK (cont'd) Lisa, get up. It's like shaking a doll. DEREK (cont'd) Get up or I'll drag you out and throw you in the hall. That's when Derek sees it. On the night stand: an empty bottle of prescription pills. Derek picks up the bottle and looks at the label: Ambien. Derek grabs the bedside phone and punches Desk. DEREK (cont'd) (fighting panic) This is 622. There's a woman in my room, she's taken an overdose of prescription pills -- Ambien. You need to get the paramedics and security up here right away. Please hurry. Derek hangs up. Now he puts one knee on the bed and takes Lisa's face in his hands, turning her head. He might as well be handling a marionette. DEREK (cont'd) (SHOUTS) Lisa! No response. He puts his ear to her naked chest, trying to detect a heartbeat. If there is one, he can't hear it. Derek gently slaps her cheeks. Rolls back her eye lids. Nothing. DEREK (cont'd) Oh god... Now Derek begins to perform CPR. He tilts Lisa's jaw back, clears her mouth and begins to breathe into her, alternating chest compressions. EREK (cont'd) Lisa! Wake up, goddamn it... C UT TO:
S: INT. ER WAITING AREA - NIGHT
N: In a corner, Derek looks haggard, being interviewed by a veteran police detective, MONICA REYES. Reyes looks more like a middle-aged suburban mom than a cop but she's very good at her job.
C: REYES
D: All right, Mister Charles, let me get this straight. E) (MOR
E: MOR
N: REYES(cont'd) This girl you barely know, works in your office, fantasizes you're having an affair and when you reject her, she tries to commit suicide in your bed.
C: DEREK
D: I know how it sounds but, yeah, that's pretty much it.
C: REYES
D: This affair...
C: DEREK
D: There WAS NO affair.
C: REYES
D: So she just... made it up in her head? With no help from you?
C: DEREK
D: Maybe I was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, I don't know. All I know is I did not lead her on.
C: REYES
D: And you had no idea she'd be at the hotel?
C: DEREK
D: None. I don't even know how she got in my room.
C: REYES
D: Apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key.
C: DEREK
D: Doesn't that prove she did this on her own?
C: REYES
D: All it proves is she lost her key.
C: DEREK
D: She never had a key.
C: REYES
D: Look, Mister Charles, I don't care if you were or weren't banging this girl. I just need to get your version for my report.
E: MORE
N: REYES(cont'd) Besides, if it's a question of innocence, I'm not the one you have to convince.
C: EREK
D: What do you mean?
C: REYES
D: Let's just say I wouldn't like to explain a situation like this to my husband.
N: Before Derek can respond, Reyes sees AN ER DOCTOR signalling. REYES (cont'd) I'll be right back. Reyes goes to talk to the Doctor. Derek watches them talk. The Doctor hands Reyes a piece of paper. Derek can't stand the suspense. He walks over and interrupts.
C: DEREK
D: How is she?
N: Reyes nods to the Doctor and takes Derek aside.
C: REYES
D: They pumped her out in time. Doctor says she's groggy and disoriented. Probably tomorrow they'll move her out of ICU and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation. All suicides are put on 72 hour hold, it's standard.
C: EREK
D: Did she say anything?
C: REYES
D: As a matter of fact, she was lucid long enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency. He wrote it down. Here.
N: Reyes hands Derek a piece of paper. Written on it is DEREK CHARLES and his phone number. REYES (cont'd) Still want to stick to your story?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHARLES HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
N: Dawn is breaking as Derek guides the Yukon into the drive. He steps out, hesitates. The front door of the house opens to reveal a very tense looking Beth in a robe. They look at each other across the distance. Derek walks to her.
C: BETH
D: Tell me everything. From the beginning.
E: a little cold
N: Derek nods. This is not going to be easy.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: erek has told it all. Beth, looking stunned, stares at him, uncomprehending. A long beat, then...
C: BETH
D: How could you let this happen?
C: DEREK
D: You think I encouraged it?
C: BETH
D: Maybe you liked it.
C: DEREK
D: Beth...
C: BETH
D: What man wouldn't? The attentions of a pretty young girl? I can just see those adoring blue eyes batting at you every time you told her how pretty she looked or what a nice dress --
C: DEREK
D: Stop it, Beth. You know I never said those things.
C: BETH
D: You must have said something. Done something to give her the idea.
C: DEREK
D: If I did, it wasn't intentional.
C: ETH
D: She was in your bed, Derek! You spent the night together and you want me to believe nothing happened?
C: DEREK
D: I was passed out... drunk. Nothing happened.
C: BETH
D: Damn you, Derek. Damn you.
N: Beth turns away, her face burning.
C: DEREK
D: I love you, Beth. I love Kyle and the life we have together. I would never do anything to screw that up. This girl is disturbed. She's seriously disturbed and for some reason, she fixated on me.
C: ETH
D: Why?
C: DEREK
D: I don't know. She's crazy.
C: BETH
D: You should have told me. From the very beginning, you should have told me.
C: DEREK
D: I know.
C: BETH
D: Why didn't you?
C: DEREK
D: At first I thought it was no big deal. And then... I was just embarrassed. I didn't know how to explain it to you without looking...
C: BETH
D: Guilty?
C: DEREK
D: I said I was wrong.
N: A beat.
C: BETH
D: Did she know about us, Derek?
C: DEREK
D: What?
C: BETH
D: How we met?
C: DEREK
D: Don't do this, Beth. You'll make yourself sick.
C: BETH
D: I'm already sick.
C: DEREK
D: Honey, I know I screwed up...
N: Derek reaches out. DEREK (cont'd) But I've told you the truth. I have to know you believe me.
C: BETH
D: I don't know what to believe. All I know is, I need to be alone for awhile.
E: weary sigh
C: DEREK
D: Beth, don't --
C: BETH
D: I need to be alone --
N: Beth moves quickly upstairs. Leaving Derek there. He sits back on the couch, head in his hands. At a loss. After a beat-
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Derek makes a determined rush up after her. Only to find the bedroom door locked. Derek's upset. Resigned, he makes his way over to--
S: INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: He grabs a pillow. Punches it twice. Knows he's in the dog HOUSE-- UT TO:
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
N: Lisa is propped up in a hospital bed, a dark brooding expression on her face, tangled hair hanging down. Just staring, eyes wide, a little dopey looking. Monica Reyes appears in the doorway.
C: REYES
D: Miss Reynolds? I'm Monica Reyes.
N: isa looks up. Her face transforms into a bright smile.
C: LISA
D: Come in. I'm sorry I'm such a mess but they won't let me take a shower or wash my hair. Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.
E: dismissive laugh
C: REYES
D: I'm a police officer assigned to your case. How are you feeling?
C: LISA
D: Well, still a bit groggy from the medication. But it isn't stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble I've caused.
C: REYES
D: Do you feel like talking about the other night?
C: LISA
D: Have you spoken to Derek?
C: REYES
D: Yes.
C: LISA
D: And he's all right?
C: REYES
D: Relatively speaking.
C: ISA
D: When can I see him?
C: EYES
D: See him?
C: LISA
D: Derek.
C: REYES
D: I'm afraid that's not possible.
C: LISA
D: Why?
C: REYES
D: Miss Sheridan, I don't think Mister Charles wants to speak to you or continue any kind of contact.
N: Lisa looks at her oddly.
C: LISA
D: Then why did he send these? Really?
N: Lisa indicates a bouquet of flowers in a vase nearby.
C: REYES
D: He sent you flowers?
E: keeping the surprise out of her voice
C: ISA
D: Peonies. My favorite.
N: Reyes inspects the attached card. "Lisa Darling, the other night was just a misunderstanding. Don't ever leave me. Love always, Derek."
C: REYES
D: When did these show up?
C: LISA
D: A few hours ago. They're lovely, aren't they?
N: eyes decides not to push it, goes into her Q & A:
C: REYES
D: Can you tell me what happened at the hotel, why you were there.
C: LISA
D: Didn't Derek tell you?
C: REYES
D: I'd like to hear your version.
C: LISA
D: There's not a lot to tell. We got together at the hotel and you can guess what we did.
C: EYES
D: Slept together. Had sex.
C: LISA
D: Of course.
C: REYES
D: Derek denies it.
C: LISA
D: He's just being a gentleman, trying to protect me.
C: REYES
D: I see. Go on.
C: LISA
D: The next day when Derek told me his wife wouldn't give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again, I guess I over reacted.
C: BEAT)
D: I didn't realize he was just being noble.
C: REYES
D: Noble?
C: LISA
D: He was thinking about his little boy, Kyle... what the breakup might do to him. He's not even two, you know. My parents broke up when I was pretty young. It leaves a scar that never really heals.
C: REYES
D: So you believe Mister Charles is in love with you? L
C: ISA
D: Read the card. Derek and I belong together and nothing can change that. But I do feel bad about his wife.
C: EYES
D: You do?
C: LISA
D: I'm not a home-wrecker. I'm not stealing him away. Their marriage is dead and Beth is in denial. It can't be easy to find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman. I just hope she doesn't do something foolish. strange smile) You know the old saying.
C: REYES
D: What's that?
C: LISA
D: "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."
N: Lisa could almost be talking about herself. Reyes nods but she's chilled.
C: REYES
D: You take it easy now. We'll talk again.
N: She excuses herself. Lisa goes back to happily smiling at her flowers.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Derek and Joe Gage.
C: JOE
D: I don't have to tell you how an incident like this could impact the company. Even the slightest whiff of impropriety...
C: DEREK
D: There was no impropriety, Joe. This is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl.
C: JOE
D: Who might retaliate by hitting us with a sexual harassment lawsuit.
C: DEREK
D: There was no sexual harassment. If anything, I'm the one who was sexually harassed. I can't believe this is happening to me. It's like a nightmare.
E: SIGHS
C: JOE
D: By now, you're probably wishing you had fucked her.
N: erek gives him a shocked look. OE (cont'd) For all the trouble it's costing you. (THEN) Sorry. Bad joke.
C: DEREK
D: Goddamit, Joe, if there's an injured party here, it's me.
C: JOE
D: Derek, calm down. I believe you and you know I'll back you up all the way. But if I find out there was something going on, I won't have a choice.
C: DEREK
D: That's not going to happen because there's nothing to find out.
C: OE
D: Good. Then you have nothing to worry about. Meantime I'm going to put Ben on the Ganz account.
C: DEREK
D: But Ganz is my client --
C: JOE
D: Look, maybe you should take some time off. Just til this blows over.
N: Marge sticks her head in.

S: INT. DEREK'S OFFICE - LATER
N: Derek and Monica Reyes face each other across Derek's desk.
C: DEREK
D: She obviously ordered the flowers for herself.
C: REYES
D: With your credit card.
C: DEREK
D: My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer. Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk.
N: Reyes gives him a blank look. DEREK (cont'd) You think I sent the flowers? I'd have to be as crazy as she is.
C: REYES
D: There's more.
C: DEREK
D: More?
N: Reyes opens a bag.

D: Beth? Are you there?
E: with concern
C: LISA
D: Derek!
N: Lisa tries to make it to the kitchen to get the phone. Beth grabs her by the sleeve and pulls her back. The sleeve tears loose in Beth's hand.
C: DEREK'S VOICE
D: Beth?
N: Lisa stumbles back toward the stairs. She scrambles upward, thinking maybe she can get to the phone in the bedroom. Lisa reaches the top step just as Beth snags her ankle, stopping her. Lisa rolls around and viciously kicks Beth in the shoulder with her other leg. Beth falls back, tumbles halfway down the stairs. EREK'S VOICE (cont'd) Beth, pick up! Lisa makes it to the bedroom.

C: DEREK
D: Lisa?
N: Before she can answer, Beth is suddenly there. She rips the phone from Lisa's hand and strikes her with it. As Lisa stumbles back into the hall landing, Beth speaks calmly, even sweetly, into the receiver.
C: BETH
D: Derek, I'm right in the middle of something... let me call you back.
C: DEREK
D: Beth --
N: Beth hangs up the phone. Alarmed, Derek hurries out of the office, punching a number into his cell as he runs to the elevator. A nervous Patrick watches Derek exit... EREK (cont'd) I need to speak to Lt. Reyes. It's an emergency! Beth goes out into the hall and Lisa springs on her. he two women fight, going up against the bannister. They claw and punch at each other. With renewed strength, Lisa forces Beth up against the bannister. Beth looks over the side and down... Fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table. Lisa bangs Beth against the bannister. A few feet away is a heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a metal chain. he bannister rail begins to crack. Lisa tries to force Beth over, then Beth suddenly swings them around, reversing positions -- The bannister cracks, breaks apart and Lisa topples over the side. As she's about to fall, Lisa reaches out and grabs the chandelier with both hands. By a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to pull loose from it's ceiling mount. Plaster cracks and rips away. Lisa swings back and forth, dangling. Beth stands on the landing. She looks at terrified Lisa, then up at the ceiling mount. It won't take Lisa's weight much longer. And both women know it. Lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to Beth who could pull her to safety.
C: LISA
D: Please....
N: Beth considers. Then, as if coming out of dream, she slowly reaches out to Lisa. Their hands lock together. Beth slowly pulls Lisa toward her, toward safety.

D: Let go of the chandelier.
E: quiet voice
C: LISA
D: No...
E: AFRAID
C: BETH
D: Let go, Lisa.
N: he chandelier is about to break loose. ETH (cont'd) (motherly concern) Listen to me. You have to let go right now. And, trusting, Lisa lets go. But so does Beth!!! With a look of horror on her face, Lisa falls through space. The soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion. Down, down, down Lisa falls. Her arms and legs flop around like a marionette with its strings cut, clawing the air. The fall seems endless. Then... Lisa hits the glass dining table with her back. Her whole body buckles. The surface of the table ripples. In slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa, framing her entire body, forming a halo around her head. Sound returns -- the sound of breaking glass -- and it's deafening. The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor, her skull cracking. Her back is probably broken but she's still conscious. ying there, Lisa stares up at Beth on the landing as glass bounces and TINKLES around her. The two enemies lock eyes. Beth's face is impassive. Lisa opens her mouth, trying to speak. And that's when the chandelier breaks loose. Beth watches without emotion as the chandelier plunges downward and hits Lisa in the chest with a radiantly beautiful shower of crystals. It kills her on impact. e come out of slow motion. Real time resumes. On the landing, Beth stares down at Lisa's body, splayed under the chandelier like a broken doll. Lisa's eyes are open but they're dead. Beth, stoic, just stands there, looking down.
