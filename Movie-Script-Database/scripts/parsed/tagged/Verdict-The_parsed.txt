S: INT. FIRST FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
N: A working-class funeral in progress. THIRTY PEOPLE and an inexpensive bier SEEN from the back of the hall. ANGLE A MAN's back FILLS the SCREEN. He is dressed in a black suit; his hands are clasped behind him. ANOTHER MAN stands next to him. The Second Man reaches behind the First Man's back and puts a discreetly folded ten-dollar bill into his hands. ANGLE These Two Men from the front. Both somber, in their early fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral parlor. ANGLE The WIDOW. A woman in her late fifties sitting by the bier receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First Man (the recipient of the money) speaks:
C: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
D: Mrs. Dee, this is Frank Galvin -- a very good friend of ours, and a very fine attorney.
C: GALVIN
D: It's a shame about your husband, Mrs. Dee.
N: The Widow nods.

E: shakes head in sympathy
N: GALVIN removes a business card from his jacket pocket and hands it to her as if he were giving her money. (i.e., "Take it. Really. I want you to have it..." She takes the card. Beat.

D: Well...
E: thoughtfully realizes he is usurping her time
N: He shakes her hand and moves on.
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
N: Galvin sitting in the deserted coffee shop in his raincoat. Reading a section of the paper. He picks up his teacup, drinks. Lowers it to the table. ANGLE - INSERT Galvin twists tea bag around a spoon to extract last drops of tea. His hand moves to his felt pen lying on the table. He moves his hand to the paper, open at the obituary section. We SEE several names crossed out. He circles one funeral listing. ANGLE Galvin sitting, raises cup of tea to his lips. Looks around deserted coffee shop. Sighs.
S: INT. SECOND FUNERAL HOME AND STREET - AFTERNOON
N: Galvin outside a second funeral home. WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE entering, Galvin enters the home. ANGLE Galvin, coming down the aisle toward the front, shrugging himself out of his overcoat, he approaches the BEREAVED WIDOW sitting by the front of the home, he extracts his card from his pocket, starts to speak. He is stopped by the WIDOW'S SON, a hefty man in his mid-forties, who interjects himself between Galvin and the widow.
C: SON
D: What is that...?
E: of the card
C: GALVIN
D: I...

C: GALVIN
D: I'm talking to this man...
E: to Funeral Manager
C: FUNERAL MANAGER
D: Excuse me, Mrs. Cleary...
N: He is manhandling Galvin toward the back of the funeral parlor. The Son calls after him:

C: FUNERAL MANAGER
D: I don't want you coming back here. Ever. Do you understand?
C: GALVIN
D: I was just talking to...
C: FUNERAL MANAGER
D: Those are bereaved people in there.
N: The Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners. "Good evening..." ANGLE Galvin, the ground cut out from under him. Standing watching the mourners enter.
S: EXT. SECOND FUNERAL STREET - DUSK
N: Galvin walking down a residential street. He has been walking a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic. Lights a cigarette. The light changes. He looks both ways and irresolutely starts across the street. He stops. He checks his watch. He sighs, and starts back in the opposite direction.
S: INT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - NIGHT
N: Galvin holding forth at the bar of a seedy drinking-man's establishment, THREE DRINKERS, acquaintances, standing around him, appreciative.
C: GALVIN

N: The bartender, JIMMY, comes up to Galvin.
C: JIMMY
D: Another, Frank...?
C: GALVIN
D: ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...' Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
E: gestures to include group gestures to Jimmy
S: INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files, carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass. He has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing. Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so. He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference..." He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still- ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink. As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the floor: a MAN'S VOICE. "Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are you there...? Frank..." Galvin pays no attention. Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of degrees. ANGLE - P.O.V. The empty wall. Galvin's P.O.V. The telephone heard Voice Over insisting, "Frank..."
S: INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - NIGHT
N: MICKEY MORRISSEY, a man in his late sixties, dressed in suit and overcoat, looking worried, unlocks the door to the dark anteroom. Looks around. Sees something in the next room. ANGLE - P.O.V. Galvin asleep on his couch, clothed as before. Covered in his overcoat, the bottle and glass next to the couch on the floor, the sound of the phone off the hook. ANGLE Mickey walks into the office. Stands looking at Galvin.
C: MICKEY
D: Get up. Get up.
E: harshly beat, more harshly
N: Galvin wakes up. Looks around. Swings his legs over the couch. Drinks from the glass. Vacantly:
C: GALVIN
D: Hi, Mickey...
C: MICKEY
D: What the hell do you think you're doing...? What's going on here...?
E: surveys the wrecked office
C: GALVIN
D: Uh...
C: MICKEY
D: Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
C: GALVIN
D: ...now who is that...?
C: MICKEY
D: ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
C: GALVIN
D: Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
C: MICKEY
D: One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
C: GALVIN
D: ...hey, I don't need your charity...
C: MICKEY
D: ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
N: Galvin pours himself a drink.
C: GALVIN
D: Hey, what are you, my nanny?
N: Mickey walks to him, knocks the drink out of his hand and slaps him several times in the face.
C: MICKEY
D: Listen to me. Listen to me... listen to me, Frank, 'cause I'm done fuckin' with you. I can't do it any more. Look around you: You think that you're going to change? What's going to change it? You think it's going to be different next month? It's going to be the same. And I have to stop. This is it. I got you a good case, it's a moneymaker. You do it right and it will take care of you. But I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this is the end. Life is too short, and I'm too old.
E: beat beat
N: Mickey walks out of the office. Slams the door. Beat. Galvin looks around the office. Goes to his sofa. Sits, reaches to side table. ANGLE - INSERT The side table, a pack of Luckies. Galvin taking one, his hand shaking a little. Also on side table a pile of change containing a small rosary and a wedding ring.
S: INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - INSERT - DAY
N: The carriage of a typewriter. A sheet of paper. Its letterhead reads "Frank P. Galvin. Attorney at Law, 124 State Street, Boston, Mass. 02981. Cable FRAGAL." Someone is typing, "Sorry I had to go out. Back at 10. Judge Geary called. Are you available for lunch Wednesday University Club?" A hand takes a paper from carriage and puts it on desk. Takes a pen and signs, "Claire." ANGLE Galvin in the anteroom, dressed in his suit, unshaved, having just signed the paper. He takes a piece of Scotch tape from the dispenser on the desk, picks up a file folder from the coffee table. It is torn in several places and rudely Scotch- taped. ANGLE - P.O.V. - INSERT The file headed Deborah Ann Kaye v. St. Catherine Laboure Hospital et. al. ANGLE Galvin surveys the anteroom, opens door to corridor, Scotch tapes the note he has just typewritten to the outside of the door.
S: INT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - DAY
N: Dark paneling, clean, simple. A drinkers' bar. OLD BARTENDER and THREE CUSTOMERS spaced widely, Galvin in his overcoat downing a shot, the file open before him. He is reading. He checks his watch, scoops the file together under his arm, throws a dollar on the bar, and heads for the door.
S: INT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Galvin walking tentatively down the corridor of a very rundown nursing home. He receives suspicious looks from the Attendants. He is checking numbers on the doors against a notation in the file. He finds the correct door and enters.
S: INT. NURSING HOME WARD - DAY
N: The door to the ward from the inside. Galvin opening the door to the dark ward, backlit, tentative, a little unsteadied from his drinking. He puts his back against the door, puts down file and briefcase, extracts a small cheap Polaroid camera from the briefcase, readies it to shoot, picks up his paraphernalia, and starts off down the ward. As he walks down the ward he checks the file hung at the foot of each bed. Galvin stops at the foot of one bed and reads the chart. ANGLE - P.O.V. The chart held by Galvin. DEBORAH ANN KAYE, various medical notations. He lowers the chart and we SEE in the bed beyond it a shriveled, tiny form stuck with needles and tubes. ANGLE Galvin replaces the chart, puts his file, briefcase, etc. on the foot of the bed, takes a flash photo of the figure in the bed. Takes another one. Puts down camera, sits on the end of the bed gazing at the unseen form. He lights a cigarette, and sits looking at her.

C: SALLY
D: ...we, we love her, Dick and me...
C: GALVIN
D: ...I'm sure you do...
C: SALLY
D: But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
C: GALVIN
D: ...I know. I went...
C: SALLY
D: ...You saw her?
C: GALVIN
D: Yes. Yes, I have.
C: SALLY
D: You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
E: beat
C: GALVIN
D: ...fifty thousand dollars?
C: SALLY

C: GALVIN
D: ...I understand...
C: SALLY
D: My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
C: GALVIN
D: ...I understand...
C: SALLY
D: ...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
N: The door to the corridor opens and DICK DONEGHY, a workingman in his forties, comes into the room. Sally and Galvin stand.
C: SALLY
D: This is my husband.
N: Donegy and Galvin shake hands uncomfortably. He motions the two to sit.
C: GALVIN
D: Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
C: DONEGHY
D: ...that's all right.
C: GALVIN
D: I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
C: SALLY
D: He saw her at the Northern Care...
C: GALVIN
D: ...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
C: DONEGHY
D: ...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
C: GALVIN
D: I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
C: DONEGHY
D: ...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
C: GALVIN
D: I completely understand...
C: DONEGHY
D: We just...
C: SALLY
D: We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away.
E: beat
C: GALVIN
D: I'm going to see you get that chance.
C: DONEGHY
D: What is this going to cost?

E: V.O.
N: A hand turns a page and reveals a second clipping: "Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case," with a picture of a very confused Galvin at around forty-five being led to jail.
C: ALITO
D: 'Married Patricia Harrington, nineteen sixty...'
N: ANGLE The small, sumptuously appointed Italianate office. French windows, a fire in the grate, a view of Boston Common, JOSEPH ALITO, a slender, elegant man in his forties dressed in a very expensive suit, reading from his notes, news clippings, etc., which are held in a leather folder.
C: ALITO
D: 'Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce nineteen sixty as a full partner. Resigned the firm nineteen sixt-ynine over the Lillibridge case...' Do you...?
N: Alito, strolling as he reads, moves toward the windows with his file TO REVEAL BISHOP BROPHY, a self-contained man in his early sixties, sitting on a leather couch, listening.
C: BISHOP
D: He was accused of jury tampering.
C: ALITO
D: Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
C: BISHOP
D: Four cases in three years...
C: ALITO
D: The man's an ambulance chaser...
C: BISHOP
D: ...tell me about this case.
C: ALITO
D: This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
C: BISHOP
D: No -- we don't want this case in court.
C: ALITO
D: Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
C: BISHOP
D: I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
C: ALITO
D: No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
C: BISHOP
D: So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
C: ALITO
D: All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
N: The Bishop nods, meaning, "You are dismissed." As an afterthought:
C: BISHOP
D: If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
C: ALITO
D: Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
C: BISHOP
D: I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
C: ALITO
D: Yes.
E: in an "of course" tone
N: Alito, preparing to leave, reaches to the Bishop's desk, where he has laid his leather folder. ANGLE The clipping in the folder, confused Galvin being led into jail, "Boston Lawyer Held in Jury Tampering Case." Alito's hand snaps the folder shut.
S: INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY

E: reading from notes
N: She hands him typed memo slip.
C: GALVIN
D: ...he wants to testify...?
E: surprised
C: CLAIRE
D: It looks that way.
C: GALVIN
D: You know what that would mean?
C: GALVIN
D: To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
C: CLAIRE
D: ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
N: Phone rings. Claire moves to it.
C: GALVIN
D: This is going to drive the ante up.
E: delighted
C: CLAIRE
D: Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
E: into phone
N: She gestures to Galvin, "Do you want to talk to them?" Galvin gestures back, "No. I'm not in..."
C: CLAIRE
D: I'm sorry, he's not in... may I take a mess... tomorrow when, two o'clock... I'll check my book...
N: She looks to Galvin, who nods, "yes."
C: CLAIRE
D: Yes. Mr. Galvin's clear at that time... the Bishop's office, tomorrow, the fifth at two p.m. Thank you...

C: GALVIN
D: That's the call that I'm waiting for.
C: CLAIRE
D: What does it mean?

C: GALVIN
D: Dr. Gruber...?
N: The Doctor on the phone gestures behind him to a thirty-ish MAN in blue jeans smoking a cigar, changing at his locker. Galvin walks over to him.

E: turning
N: He checks his watch, continues changing into suede jacket, checks next appointment on a leather appointment book, locks the locker, pockets key.
C: GALVIN
D: I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
C: GRUBER

C: GRUBER
D: Why?
N: A beat.
C: GALVIN
D: Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...

C: GRUBER
D: Her doctors killed her.
E: glances at watch, impatient
C: GALVIN
D: I'm sorry...?
E: a beat
C: GRUBER
D: Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her.
E: a beat
C: GALVIN
D: Do you know who her doctors were?
C: GRUBER
D: I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
C: GALVIN
D: The most respected...
C: GRUBER
D: Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
E: smiling
N: A beat. Gruber discards end of a cigar. Takes a leather case from his suede jacket, extracts a new cigar. Offers one to Galvin.
C: GRUBER
D: You want a cigar?
N: Galvin takes one absently.
C: GALVIN
D: The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
C: GRUBER
D: What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...? Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
E: checks watch
N: Galvin, excited, is trying to light the cigar. His hand shakes badly. He has forgotten to bite off the end. He bites it, lights the cigar.
C: GALVIN
D: Well, well, when can we meet again.
N: I'd like to get a deposition..
C: GRUBER
D: Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday night... I gotta go. You going my way?

C: GRUBER
D: I understand.
C: GALVIN
D: ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
N: They stop before a 1950s very beautiful small Mercedes Sedan. Gruber opens the door, gets into the plush red leather interior, starts car, leaves door open, still talking to Galvin.

N: Galvin scribbles information in his appointment book.
C: GALVIN

N: Galvin is at the bar, smiling to himself. His drink is being refilled. To BARTENDER:
C: GALVIN
D: I want to buy you a drink.
C: JIMMY
D: Thanks, Franky.
E: THE BARTENDER
N: Galvin looks around. A very attractive self-possessed YOUNG WOMAN is sitting in the crook of the bar across from him; she is intently perusing the newspaper and circling items with a felt pen. Galvin speaks to her:
C: GALVIN

N: She looks up. Smiles.

D: I'd like an apartment.
C: GALVIN
D: Settle for a drink?

E: beat, smiles, downs drink, gets up off the stool, sincerely
C: GALVIN
D: You're very welcome.
N: He watches her as she leaves the bar. He turns back to his drink.
C: GALVIN
D: Well, well, well. Huh?

C: GALVIN
D: It's a long road that has no turning.
E: sighs

S: INT. GALVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A shoddy one-and-a-half room bachelor apartment. Galvin, beer and cigarettes on the table beside him. He is sitting on an armchair in the bedroom. A yellow legal pad in his lap. He is talking on the phone softly, soothingly.
C: GALVIN
D: I'm going to the Archdiocese tomorrow at two. I know you don't. I know you don't... no, you're just following your life. You have a life too... you have to move out West. It doesn't help you to stay here. Well... I'm sure she knows you care for her.
N: His attention wanders to the legal pad in his lap. ANGLE - P.O.V. The legal pad. Spread on it a couple of Polaroids of Deborah Ann in the nursing home. Below them, written on the pad, large, "Dr. David Gruber. Ass't. Chief Anesthesiology, Mass. Commonwealth. 'They killed her. And they killed her kid -- Her doctors murdered her.'"

E: voice over; on phone
N: ANGLE - GALVIN ON THE PHONE
C: GALVIN
D: As soon as I know... you give him my respects too. Not at all. Not at all... Good night. Well, bless you, too. Good night.
E: into phone beat
N: He hangs up phone, sighs. Lights a cigarette. Rotates his neck to loosen it up. Reaches to the table next to his bed for the bottle to pour a drink. ANGLE - INSERT His hand reaching for the bottle. On the table the photo of a very beautiful blonde woman in a silver frame. She is the same woman we saw earlier in the news clip. She is on the deck of a sailboat, laughing. A pile of change on the table, a money clip, a rosary, and the wedding ring in the pile of change. ANGLE Galvin looking at the photo in the silver frame next to his bed. He sighs deeply. Beat. Reaches up to the lamp above his head and turns it off. He sits stiffly in the dark a moment, then lets his head fall back to the chair.
S: INT. NORTHERN NURSING HOME WARD - DAY
N: Galvin, spruced up a bit, sitting on a bed, his briefcase on his lap. Gazing at the unseen Deborah Ann Kaye in the dark ward. Silent. Beat. He looks in his briefcase, takes out a file. ANGLE - P.O.V. - INSERT The file, labeled Deborah Ann Kaye. Galvin extracting the photo of the young mother romping with her two children; he takes the yellow legal pad from his briefcase and puts it on top of the picture (the figures crossed out; "Her doctors murdered her," etc.). We hear the door to the ward open and TWO IRISH WOMEN gossiping. IRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.) Jimmy, I said, don't you go in your pocket if there's nothing there... IRISH NURSE #2 (V.O.) ...and what did he say...? IRISH NURSE #1 (V.O.) (spies Galvin, her tone changes) ...Sir, you aren't allowed to be in here... ANGLE Galvin sitting on the bed looking at Deborah Ann. He looks up to the speaker. A slovenly Irish Nurse, who has come into the room and is standing by him. The other Nurse is framed in the doorway. Galvin is lost in thought.
C: NURSE
D: You can't be in here.
C: GALVIN
D: I'm her attorney.
E: as if remembering something, simply
S: INT. BISHOP BROPHY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The Bishop from the waist up, sitting behind his beautiful desk. Compassionately:
C: BISHOP
D: It's a question of continuing values. St. Catherine's -- to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community. So we have a question of balance. On the one hand, the reputation, and, so, the effectiveness of our hospital, and two of her important doctors -- and, on the other hand, the rights of your client.
N: ANGLE Galvin seated across from the Bishop. A YOUNG PRIEST seated, discreetly, attentively, across the room. Sherry glasses in front of Galvin and the Bishop. Galvin drinking from his.
C: BISHOP
D: A young woman. In her prime... deprived of... ...life... sight... her family... It's tragic. It's a tragic accident.
E: searches for a word
N: Galvin has been dreaming.
C: BISHOP
D: ...nothing, of course, can begin to make it right. But we must do what we can. We must do all that we can.
N: He gestures to the Young Priest, who crosses the room, extracts a sheet from a file folder, and places it before Galvin, who is sitting as if in a dream. The Bishop waits a beat, not wanting to interrupt Galvin's reverie, then catches his eye and gestures down at the paper. Galvin glances down. INSERT The sheet: "I, Frank P. Galvin, duly appointed conservator for Deborah Ann Kaye, in consideration of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000.00) paid in hand to me this day by St. Catherine Laboure Hospital do hereby release from any and all claims..." ANGLE Galvin and the Bishop as before. Galvin finishes reading, looks up.
C: BISHOP
D: Yes. We must try to make it right.
N: Beat. Galvin nods. Beat. Bishop nods discreetly to the Young Priest who extracts Mount Blanc fountain pen from his pocket, holds it out to Galvin.
C: BISHOP
D: It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
E: beat
C: GALVIN
D: How did you settle on the amount?
C: BISHOP
D: We thought it was just.
C: GALVIN
D: You thought it was just.
C: BISHOP
D: Yes.
C: GALVIN
D: Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
C: BISHOP
D: That was our insurance company's recommendation.
C: GALVIN
D: Yes. It would be.
N: A beat.
C: BISHOP
D: Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
C: GALVIN
D: And no one will know the truth.
C: BISHOP
D: What is the truth?
C: GALVIN
D: That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. I can't do it. I can't take it.
E: beat to Young Priest, waving away document beat; pleading for understanding
C: YOUNG PRIEST
D: If we may discuss money, Mr. Galvin. How is your law practice?
C: GALVIN
D: It's not too good. I've only got one client.
N: HOLD.

D: What?
C: GALVIN
D: You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
C: MICKEY
D: I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
N: You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
C: GALVIN
D: ...he's a good man...
C: MICKEY
D: ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
C: GALVIN
D: ...I have to stand up for her...
C: MICKEY
D: Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
C: GALVIN
D: I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will you help me...? Will you help me...?

The CAMERA FOLLOWS the Attorney tearing through the corridors of the office, up a spiral staircase, through yet more office space, into:
S: INT. CONCANNON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: ...a conference room. Mahogany, tinted glass, a panoramic view of Boston. Twenty-five attorneys, male and female, mostly young, gaze at the young Attorney as he enters the room. He stops running. He approaches the front of the room tentatively. Standing at the blackboard in front of the conference room is EDWARD CONCANNON. Senior partner of the firm, late fifties, imposing, he radiates success. As the young Attorney approaches Concannon he is stopped with a gesture. Concannon addresses the room.
C: CONCANNON
D: Anybody ever hear, 'For want of a shoe a horse was lost?' Who's going on vacation tomorrow?
E: smiling
N: A young MAN raises his hand.

D: Friedman. St. Barts. is that right?

N: Concannon motions to the young Attorney who has run in. The young Attorney goes to Concannon and hands him a box of chalk. Concannon takes a piece and writes on the blackboard "Jan. 12th." He underlines it heavily.
C: CONCANNON
D: Our court date is January twelfth. You're all acquainted with this case. It's been scheduled for eighteen months. We have the attorney for the Plaintiff, Frank Galvin -- and I trust you are all familiar with his record -- and we have been expecting him to call us to negotiate. As he did not, and five days before we're supposed to go to court we made him a rather generous offer, which he refused. Five days before the trial. What does this mean? I want to find out. Research") Homework") Acquaint yourselves again with the depositions. Don't rely on the fact that we did it last year. Do it again. We're going to review them here, and you do it at home. You each have a full file. Know the deps, and I want you all to be here when we work with the defendants... when is that, Billy...?
E: writes on the blackboard, "1 writes "2 writes "2
N: The young Attorney responds.
C: YOUNG LAWYER
D: Tuesday evening, Sir.
E: BILLY
N: Concannon writes on blackboard "3) Public Awareness."
C: CONCANNON
D: I want an article in the Globe As Soon As Possible, 'St. Cat's... Neighborhood Giant serving the community' etc. We've got it in the files. I want something in Monday's Herald: 'Our Gallant Doctors,' something... Be inventive, I want television... ...talk to our man at GBH. And to belabor the obvious for a moment... Our clients are: the Archdiocese of Boston; St. Catherine Laboure Hospital, and Drs. Marx and Towler, two of the most respected men in their profession. The thrust of this defense will be to answer in court, in the press and in the public mind -- to answer the accusation of negligence this completely: not only that we win the case, but that we win the case so that it's seen that the attack on these men and this institution was a rank obscenity. All right. Let's get the cobwebs off. Billy...?
E: nods toward one of the young lawyers beat beat
N: The young Lawyer stands as Concannon sits, listening.

S: INT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: Galvin and Mickey at a library table piled with books. A dingy, dusty law library. They are smoking, speak in undertones, referring to the yellow legal pads in front of them. Rehashing material.
C: MICKEY
D: Who have we got?
C: GALVIN
D: We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
C: MICKEY
D: You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
C: GALVIN
D: Admittance form is wrong.
C: MICKEY
D: Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
C: GALVIN
D: I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
C: MICKEY
D: ...Gruber's not bad.
E: conceding

D: Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...' They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?

E: beat
C: LAURA
D: And are they going to get it?
C: GALVIN
D: They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'

N: The bedroom, dark, sound of people moving, the bedside light is flicked on. We SEE Galvin in shirt-sleeves, holding a whiskey glass a little unsettled, turning on the light, Laura, with a glass, also a bit unsteady, standing beside him. Both awkward. He looks at her, turns back to the bed, turns down the bed, sees the silver-framed picture of his wife, he looks back at Laura, starts to take the picture to turn it down.

N: ANGLE - P.O.V. GALVIN Concannon, brisk, expensive-looking, tanned, huge gold watch, custom-made suit.
C: JUDGE
D: They tell me that no bargain ever was completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a deal.
E: V.O.
N: Concannon feels Galvin's eye on him, half-turns, smiles. ANGLE - THE JUDGE, CONCANNON, GALVIN
C: JUDGE
D: Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
C: GALVIN
D: This is a complicated case, your Honor...
C: JUDGE
D: I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
E: smiles at Galvin
C: GALVIN
D: My client can't walk, your Honor.
C: JUDGE
D: I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
C: CONCANNON
D: Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
C: JUDGE
D: Huh!
C: CONCANNON
D: My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way.
E: beat turns to Galvin beat
C: GALVIN
D: We are going to try the case.
N: A beat. Galvin fumbles for a cigarette. The three sit in silence.
C: JUDGE
D: That's it...? Come on, guys... life is too short... You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
E: incredulous beat beat beat; turns to Galvin
C: GALVIN
D: ...things change.
C: JUDGE
D: ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
C: GALVIN
D: I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
C: JUDGE
D: And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. I myself would take it and run like a thief.
E: beat
C: GALVIN
D: I'm sure you would.
N: The Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and insulted him. He controls himself.
C: JUDGE
D: Hm. We have the date set? Next Thursday. Good. See you boys in court.
E: beat; checking book smiles

C: DR. TOWLER
D: Well, many reasons, actually...

E: beat

S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: They enter the courtroom. CAMERA FOLLOWS them in. The room one-quarter filled. Concannon at the defense table with the Defendants, a Black Lawyer, entourage. Galvin stops.
C: GALVIN
D: I'm going to do the best I can for you and your sister. I know what it means to you. Believe me... It means that much to me.
E: to Sally beat
N: He turns away, walks toward the front of the courtroom, glances toward the jury box. ANGLE - P.O.V. The Jury, somber, controlled, dignified. ANGLE Galvin continuing to the defense table, Mickey Morrissey already seated, studying notes on a yellow legal pad. Galvin sits. Mickey looks up.
C: MICKEY

D: I'm swell.
C: MICKEY
D: And all we've got is a witch doctor!
C: GALVIN
D: Yeah.
N: The BAILIFF enters, some SPECTATORS, knowing the routine, start getting to their feet.
C: MICKEY
D: Look at it this way: it's refreshing every time a Doctor takes the stand he's not a Jew.
N: We hear the Bailiff's "All rise." ANGLE The COURTROOM getting to its feet as JUDGE WILLIAM B. HOYLE enters. The Bailiff, as the Judge sits:
C: BAILIFF

D: Let's begin.
N: Galvin gets to his feet. Walks over to the JURY. Looks at them, appraising. He pauses as before a great effort. Takes a breath. Exhales.
C: GALVIN
D: It's a terrible thing to sit in judgment. So much rides on it. I know that you've thought, 'How can I be pure. How can I be impartial without being cold. How can I be merciful and still be just?' And I know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this morning to be helped. To judge correctly. We have the reputation of two men. Two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us. And with those two respected men we have my client, Deborah Ann Kaye... ...who was deprived of sight, of locomotion, hearing, speech, of everything, in short, which constitutes her life. We are going to prove she was deprived through negligence. Through the negligence of those respected men. We will show: One...

S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: The jury box. One JUROR leans over and makes a whispered comment to another. The SECOND JUROR nods, inclines his head toward the witness box. ANGLE DR. Thompson on the stand. Composed, waiting. Concannon consulting his notes.
C: CONCANNON
D: Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
C: CONCANNON
D: Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: Just as you are, Sir...
C: CONCANNON
D: Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
C: CONCANNON
D: ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: No.
C: CONCANNON
D: Neurology?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: No.

C: CONCANNON
D: Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: I'm on the staff of...
C: CONCANNON
D: Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
C: CONCANNON
D: Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
N: Concannon sits.
C: JUDGE
D: Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
E: in undertone, to Bailiff glances at watch, Bailiff nods to him
C: GALVIN
D: Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
E: rising
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: I did.
C: CONCANNON
D: Objection.
C: JUDGE
D: Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
C: GALVIN
D: What?
C: JUDGE
D: I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
E: patronizing
N: A beat.
C: GALVIN
D: Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
C: GALVIN
D: In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
C: GALVIN
D: Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
N: The Judge leans over.
C: JUDGE
D: Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
E: to Dr. Thompson
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: Well...
C: GALVIN
D: Your Honor!
N: He has shouted unconsciously; the whole Courtroom turns to look at him.
C: JUDGE
D: Yes, Mr. Galvin?
C: GALVIN
D: If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
C: JUDGE
D: I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
C: JUDGE
D: Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
C: JUDGE
D: The Doctors were not negligent.
C: DR. THOMPSON
D: I... um...
E: beat
N: The Judge shrugs, meaning, "Well then what in the hell are we doing here?" ANGLE Galvin, furious. ANGLE The Judge and Witness.
C: JUDGE
D: Thank you.
N: The Witness starts to step down. Galvin strides over to him and speaks to the Judge.
C: GALVIN
D: I'm not through with the witness, your Honor. With all due respect if you are going to try my case for me I would appreciate it if you wouldn't lose it.
N: The Judge stands, furious.
C: JUDGE
D: Thank you. I think that's enough for this morning. I'll see the Plaintiff's Counsel in my chambers. Now, please.
N: The Courtroom rises. The Bailiff is heard, "All rise, court is adjourned until one o'clock."
S: INT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS - DAY
N: Galvin, furious, standing against the wall. The Judge comes in from his own entrance, shucking his robe. Equally angry.
C: JUDGE
D: I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
C: GALVIN
D: I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
C: JUDGE
D: Listen to me, fella...
C: GALVIN
D: No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
N: Galvin is pacing. Beat.
C: JUDGE
D: Galvin, look, many years ago...
E: conciliatory
C: GALVIN
D: And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
C: JUDGE
D: Are you done?
E: beat; barely controlling anger
C: GALVIN
D: Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
C: JUDGE
D: You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.

E: V.O.
C: GALVIN
D: ...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
E: overriding him
C: CONCANNON
D: Your Honor...! Your Honor...
C: TOWLER
D: Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
C: GALVIN
D: Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
C: TOWLER
D: Yes.
C: GALVIN
D: Huh. And why is that?
E: contemptuous
C: TOWLER
D: Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...

I said, 'I've done my best.' He said, 'They don't pay you to do your best. They pay you to win.' That's what pays for this office. And that's what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor.

Laura asleep on the couch, covered with Galvin's overcoat. Galvin wakes up, startled by the sound of the mail dropping. He picks up the phone mechanically. He realizes it is morning and he has been asleep. He replaces phone. He surveys the office. Dead, resigned. He closes the phone book. He reaches in a pack of cigarettes on the desk. It is empty. He roots in the ashtray for a long butt. This disgusts him. He rejects it. Rubs his eyes. Gets up. Goes to the window, stares out. Looks back at the scene in his office. It is over. He stands by Laura and looks down at her, he looks at Mickey. He has let them down. He goes to a cabinet under the lawbooks and takes out a bottle of whiskey and a water glass. He walks into the anteroom. Sighs, sits on the couch near the door. Glances at the several letters that have just fallen through the slot. He pours a half-tumbler full of whiskey, and drains it. He refills the tumbler. He absently picks up the mail and starts mechanically sorting through it. He stops at an official-looking piece. ANGLE - P.O.V. The letter, return address MASSACHUSETTS BAR ASSOCIATION. URGENT. He lethargically opens the letter. On Bar Association letterhead, it reads: "You are directed to appear on January 15th to show cause why you should not be disbarred. You are permitted to be represented by counsel of your choice, and..." ANGLE Galvin reading the letter. He crumbles it and throws it into the wastebasket.

The letterhead reads, "CONCANNON, BARKER, WHITE," stamped huge across it in black: "CONFIDENTIAL. EYES ONLY!!!" Mickey takes out the form, turns page. It reads, "Report on Joseph Galvin," lists haunts, habits, and is heavily notated in various types of pen and pencil.

CAMERA PANS WITH him to REVEAL a woman, KATHY, who is comforting a crying child. Galvin walks over to her. Stands a respectful distance away. She sees him watching her, looks up.

D: I've been meaning to come in a long time.

C: KATHY
D: Yes.
N: Galvin, getting involved in a serious conversation, takes off his overcoat, he is going to stay awhile.
C: GALVIN
D: How come you stopped?
N: She is traumatized by the question. The casual conversation has become immediate and painful. She opens her mouth to speak, then stops, staring at Galvin. He doesn't know what she is staring at... something on his jacket. He looks down. ANGLE - KATHY'S P.O.V. The shuttle ticket, BOSTON - NEW YORK, stuck in the lapel pocket of Galvin's suitcoat.

N: The restaurant fairly deserted after the lunch crowd. Empty tables -- crisp linen, Laura alone at a table, watching the door, an untouched cup of coffee in front of her.
S: EXT. NEW YORK HOTEL - DAY
N: The doorman opens the door of a cab. ANGLE Mickey Morrissey standing in an alcove under the marquee, looking out at the street. ANGLE - P.O.V. The street. Pedestrians.

C: GALVIN
D: What are you doing in New York...?
C: MICKEY
D: Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
N: They continue walking. We cannot hear them. Galvin is becoming agitated. He stops Mickey, stands there, Mickey very sad, Galvin incredulous, talking to him. Mickey nods. Galvin starts hurriedly back down the street toward the Hotel.
S: INT. NEW YORK HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
N: LONG SHOT of Laura seated at a table alone. ANGLE Galvin at the entrance to the restaurant looking at her. He walks over to her slowly. ANGLE - CLOSEUP Laura, looks up, sees him, smiles. Her smile fades, she sees that he knows. ANGLE Laura getting up from the table. We SEE her back, and Galvin approaching. We SEE her shoulders droop, beaten. He draws closer. Galvin comes up to her, his face a mask of pain and confusion. She sighs, starts to speak. Stops. Beat. They look at each other -- he starts to speak, cannot. He knocks her to the floor, she upsets the table. A large man at the next table starts to restrain Galvin.
C: LAURA
D: It's all right... it's all right... it's all right... it's all right...
E: as if in shock

N: The doorway to his study. A basketball game dimly SEEN in the half-light. Mickey, o.s.:
C: MICKEY
D: He's not here. Yeah. I don't know when. All right.
E: pause pause
N: Sound of him hanging up a telephone. He enters the frame carrying a bottle of booze, goes through door into study. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM INTO THE ROOM. THE TV:
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The Knicks are pressing hard...
E: V.O. etc.
N: He sits on a sofa opposite the television. Watches the game a beat. Opens the fresh bottle of whiskey and pours a large shot into the almost-empty glass in front of him. Looks to his left. Reaches behind him to some glasses on a shelf, takes one down, pours drink into the new glass, leans to his left, CAMERA MOVES WITH him, and we SEE Galvin sitting in a deep leather armchair, staring. Mickey offers him the drink. Galvin becomes aware of him, shakes his head "no." Beat. Mickey moves back into his seat, they both stare at the television.
S: INT. COURTROOM -- JUDGE'S P.O.V. - DAY
N: Half full of spectators. ANGLE Galvin gets up from Plaintiff's table, takes up a large book as Dr. Towler takes the stands. He reads:
C: GALVIN
D: Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
C: DR. TOWLER
D: Yes. I wrote it.
N: Galvin shows the book.
C: GALVIN
D: 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
C: DR. TOWLER
D: I. Yes. It is.
C: GALVIN
D: And you wrote that...
C: DR. TOWLER
D: Yes.
C: GALVIN
D: ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
E: reading
C: DR. TOWLER
D: She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
C: GALVIN
D: If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
C: DR. TOWLER
D: Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
C: GALVIN
D: Thank you.
N: Galvin signals he is done. The Judge signals Dr. Towler to leave the stand, which he does.
C: JUDGE
D: Mr. Concannon...?

C: BAILIFF
D: Katherine Price...
N: ANGLE Kathy at the back of the court, coming down the aisle. As she passes the Defendant's table, Towler grabs Marx and starts whispering frantically. Concannon looks on, ignorant of what is happening. We hear Dr. Towler's "Oh, my God..." ANGLE Galvin surveys the courtroom, Kathy crosses in front of him, takes the stand, we hear the Bailiff administering the formula as we WATCH Galvin turn and look at the Jurors.
C: BAILIFF

C: KATHY
D: I did.
C: GALVIN
D: A single hour.
C: KATHY
D: Yes.
N: Galvin walks away from the witness box. He looks at the jury. He turns to look at the spectators. His thoughts are a million miles away. Unconsciously he straightens his tie. ANGLE Galvin in front of the dead-still courtroom. He breaks his reverie.
C: GALVIN
D: Your witness.
E: to Concannon
N: Concannon is on his feet as Galvin walks back to his table. Concannon walks over to Kathy and begins forcefully:
C: CONCANNON
D: You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
C: KATHY
D: It's a crime.
C: CONCANNON
D: Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
E: beat
C: KATHY
D: I wouldn't do it.
C: CONCANNON
D: You would not...?
C: KATHY
D: No.
C: CONCANNON
D: In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
C: KATHY
D: Yes.
C: CONCANNON
D: Just now...
C: KATHY
D: Yes.
C: CONCANNON
D: ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
C: KATHY
D: Yes.
E: beat
C: CONCANNON
D: Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
C: KATHY
D: I...
C: CONCANNON
D: And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today. Isn't that right? Isn't that right...?
E: beat beat
C: KATHY
D: I... yes.
C: CONCANNON
D: Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
C: KATHY
D: I...
C: CONCANNON
D: You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
C: GALVIN
D: Objection!
C: CONCANNON
D: And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
C: KATHY
D: They lied.
C: CONCANNON
D: 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
C: KATHY
D: I do. Yes.
C: CONCANNON
D: You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
E: holding chart
C: KATHY
D: That's not my handwriting.
C: CONCANNON
D: You've just said you signed it.
C: KATHY
D: Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
C: CONCANNON
D: You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
C: KATHY
D: Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
E: taking a paper out of her purse
N: She looks toward Galvin. ANGLE Galvin nods, meaning, "You did it perfectly." ANGLE Concannon, the Judge, Kathy.
C: CONCANNON
D: Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
C: JUDGE
D: I'll rule on that presently. Proceed.
E: beat
N: Concannon is taken up short. Amazed at the Judge's reaction, he pauses an instant.
C: JUDGE
D: Please proceed.
N: Concannon motions to Billy, the young lawyer, who nods in response and starts whispering instructions to his colleagues at the Defense table, who start leafing through their lawbooks. Concannon takes up the fight again.
C: CONCANNON
D: ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
C: KATHY
D: I thought I would need it.
C: CONCANNON
D: And why, please tell us, would you think that?
C: KATHY
D: After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
E: beat beat beat; starts to cry
N: She is weeping copiously. A beat. She starts to get herself under control.
C: CONCANNON
D: No further questions.

C: JUDGE
D: Mr. Galvin...?
N: ANGLE Kathy getting down from the stand. The Judge addressing Galvin.
C: GALVIN
D: Nothing further, your Honor...
C: JUDGE
D: Mr. Concannon...?
N: Concannon is signalled by Billy, the young lawyer at the Defense table, who is gathering notes from his colleagues, who have been researching during Kathy's speech. Concannon walks over to the table and is quickly "talked through" the notes by Billy.
C: JUDGE
D: Mr. Concannon.
N: Concannon cuts Billy short, meaning, "Yes, I understand, I'm far ahead of you," he takes the notes and returns to the bench.
C: CONCANNON
D: Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
C: JUDGE
D: ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
N: The Judge nods, meaning, "I am considering..." ANGLE The Judge. He is making some notations on a page in front of him. He nods to himself, he has reached a decision. He looks up.
C: JUDGE
D: The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form. It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
E: explains to them
C: CONCANNON
D: Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
C: JUDGE
D: I'm going to uphold that.
N: ANGLE Galvin getting to his feet.
C: GALVIN
D: I object, your Honor...
C: JUDGE
D: Overruled...
C: GALVIN
D: Exception!
C: JUDGE
D: Noted. Thank you. Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
E: to Jury
N: ANGLE Galvin, silent, fuming, sitting at the table.
C: JUDGE
D: Her entire testimony must be stricken from the record. You shouldn't have heard it, but you did. Now, that was my mistake... and you must strike it from your minds, give it no weight.
E: V.O.
N: Galvin takes a sheet of legal paper and starts writing on it.
S: INT. BISHOP BROPHY'S SUITE - DAY
C: ALITO
D: Legally it's over. Concannon was brilliant.
C: BROPHY
D: Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.

C: BROPHY
D: I know. Did you believe her?
S: INT. COURTROOM - JUDGE HOYLE'S P.O.V. - FULL COURTROOM - DAY
N: All looking slightly to their right. ANGLE
C: JUDGE SWEENEY
D: Mr. Galvin...?
N: ANGLE - GALVIN In front of the full jury box. Beat.
C: GALVIN
D: You know, so much of the time we're lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us what is right. Tell us what's true. There is no justice. The rich win, the poor are powerless...' We become tired of hearing people lie. After a time we become dead. A little dead. We start thinking of ourselves as victims. And we become victims. And we become weak... and doubt ourselves, and doubt our institutions... and doubt our beliefs... we say for example, 'The law is a sham... there is no law... I was a fool for having believed there was.' But today you are the law. You are the law... And not some book and not the lawyers, or the marble statues and the trappings of the court... all that they are is symbols. Of our desire to be just... All that they are, in effect, is a prayer... ...a fervent, and a frightened prayer.
E: pause pause beat beat beat beat
C: GALVIN
D: In my religion we say, 'Act as if you had faith, and faith will be given to you.' If... If we would have faith in justice, we must only believe in ourselves. And act with justice. And I believe that there is justice in our hearts. Thank you.
E: beat beat beat beat
N: He stands still a moment, then surveys the still courtroom.

N: ANGLE Galvin, totally defeated. Nods his head sadly, as if commiserating philosophically, with himself. Mickey looks at him in grief, with sympathy.

N: Beat. Galvin puts his arm around Mickey's shoulder. They push through the Exit Door, turning up their collars to the cold. Galvin hesitates a moment as Mickey goes through the door. Beat. He looks back longingly. ANGLE - GALVIN'S P.O.V. The deserted corridor. ANGLE Galvin standing framed in the doorway. He turns toward the door, his back to the CAMERA, his shoulders slumped.
