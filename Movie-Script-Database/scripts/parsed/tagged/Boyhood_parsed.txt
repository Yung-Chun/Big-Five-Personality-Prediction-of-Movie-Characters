S: EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - DAY
N: MASON waits outside his elementary school, laying in the grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him.
C: MOM
D: Hey, love bug. You ready?
N: He is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the car.
C: MASON
D: Yeah. Hey, guess what, Mom?
C: MOM
D: What?
C: MASON
D: I figured out where wasps come from.
C: MOM
D: Oh, yeah? Where?
C: MASON
D: Well, I think it must be if you flick a rock into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp.
C: MOM
D: Dang...

C: MOM
D: That's cool.
S: INT. CAR - DAY

C: MOM
D: So how was your day at school?
C: MASON
D: Fine.
C: MOM
D: Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time. I kinda liked her.
C: MASON
D: What did she say?
C: MOM
D: Well... she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments. And I told her, "I know he does them, 'cause I check them every night." She said she found a big chunk of them crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack.
C: MASON
D: She didn't ask for 'em.
C: MOM
D: Well, baby, she doesn't have to. You're supposed to turn them in. And she said you're still staring out the window all day.
C: MASON
D: Not all day.
C: MOM
D: And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener.
C: MASON
D: Not on purpose.
C: MOM
D: Wait, she said that you crammed a bunch of rocks in it.
C: MASON
D: I thought if it could sharpen pencils, maybe we could sharpen rocks.
C: MOM
D: Well, what were you gonna do with a bunch of sharpened rocks?
E: stifling laugh
C: MASON
D: I was trying to make arrowheads for my rock collection.
C: MOM
D: Hm.
N: She glances back at him, with an understanding sigh.
S: EXT. HOUSE/DITCH - DAY
N: Mason rides his bike across the front yard and heads down the street. Soon he and his friend TOMMY are riding down the embankment of a large drainage ditch.
S: EXT. DITCH - DAY
N: Mason runs up, as Tommy is spray-painting a drawing on the concrete wall of the drainage ditch.
C: MASON
D: Dude, when's my turn?
C: TOMMY
D: I don't know.
N: Tommy hands Mason the can of spray paint. Mason begins to spray-paint a letter on the wall.

S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mason lays on the floor watching a cartoon. There's a knock at the door, and Mom comes out to answer it. It's TED.

D: Hey.
C: TED
D: Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you ready? Hey, Mason.
C: MASON
D: Hey, Ted.
C: TED

D: It's okay.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The kids lie on either side of Mom, as she reads a story aloud to them.
C: MOM
D: "Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle." "Who?" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. "She haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom on the first floor," said Hermione. "She haunts a toilet?"
E: Reading MORE
C: MOM
D: "Yes, it's been out of order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place." "I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it. It's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you."
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
N: Mason lies awake in bed listening to his mother argue with Ted.
C: TED
D: Why can't you just say that?
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: I'm sorry. I don't want to go with you.
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: You're sorry, that's bullshit!
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: That's right, I wanna stay here with my kids. That's what I'd rather do.
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: All right. Would you stop using your kids as an excuse?!
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: I'm not using my kids as an excuse! You don't even know--
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: I know you have to stay here with your kids! You're acting--

E: O.S.
C: TED
D: And why do I always-- Why--
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: You have no responsibility.
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: I have an immature life! I have an immature life?
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: And I have responsibilities, okay, you don't know what it's like to be a parent.
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: No, I don't! And why am I responsible for your mistakes in life?
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: If you had any idea. You don't think I wouldn't--
E: O.S.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mason peeks around the corner to watch as the argument continues.
C: MOM
D: Don't call my kids mistakes! Don't!
C: TED
D: I'm not responsible for your life choic-- I didn't call your kids--
C: MOM
D: You said, "Your respons-- your mistakes in your life," pointing at my kids.
C: TED
D: I know what I said, you know what, and immediately you use your kids again.
N: Mason peeks through the doorway.
C: MOM
D: This is the reality: I'm a parent!
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: That's, that's hysterical.
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: That means responsibility.
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: I know you're a parent.
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: I would love to have some time to myself! I would love to just go to a fuckin' movie! You don't think I'd like that?
E: O.S. MORE
C: MOM
D: Go have some dinner, go to a bar! I don't even know what that's like. I was someone's daughter, then I was somebody's fucking mother! Okay, I don't know what that's like.
E: O.S. CONT'D
S: INT. KID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
N: Mason is comfortably asleep. Samantha slowly pulls the pillow out from underneath his head and smacks him with it.
C: SAMANTHA
D: "Oops, I did it again... I played with your heart. Got lost in the game. Oh baby, baby..."
E: singing
N: Mason throws a stuffed animal at her that she deflects.
C: SAMANTHA
D: "Oops, you think I'm in love. I'm sent from above. I'm not that innocent."
E: CONT'D
N: Another stuffed animal. She continues to sing.
C: MASON
D: Stop! Quit it!
E: O.S.
C: SAMANTHA
D: "You see my problem is this. I'm dreaming away. Wishing that heroes truly exist. I cry watching the day. Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways..."
C: MASON
D: Quit! Mom!
C: SAMANTHA
D: "But to lose all my senses-- that is..."
N: He tries to drown out this last bit with a sustained scream. Soon the door flies open and Mom enters, angry.
C: MOM
D: What the hell is going on in here?!
N: Samantha has instantaneously shifted from singing to crying.
C: MOM
D: Do you guys know what time it is?
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: He's throwing things at me...
E: through tears/sobs
C: MOM
D: Mason! Do not throw things at your sister!
C: MASON
D: She's faking, she hit me first!!
C: MOM
D: Listen, both of you! I am going back to bed. I don't wanna hear another peep out of here for an hour. Go to sleep.
N: Mom slams the door behind her. Samantha is suddenly fine, almost cheerful.
C: MASON
D: Faker!
E: to Samantha
C: MOM
D: Hey!
E: O.S.
S: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
N: Mason swings on a large outdoor swing, while Tommy sits thumbing through a catalog. Immediately after, we see Mason and Tommy looking through the lingerie section of the catalog together.

S: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: Mom, Samantha, and Mason eat lunch.
C: MOM
D: So listen, guys, I wanna talk to you about something, and you might not like this idea at first but... we're moving to Houston.
C: MASON
D: When?
C: MOM
D: Well, soon. We should be out by the first, so we don't have to pay two rents next month.
C: SAMANTHA
D: No, Mother, we're not moving. Nope, nope, sorry Mom. Nope. Nope.
N: Smack, smack, smack...
C: MOM
D: Samantha, I have to go back to college so I can make us a better living.
N: Smack.
C: MOM
D: With this job I can't take care of us the way I'd like to. I can't keep going this way. And Grandma said she'd help us out... and it would be nice to be near her.
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: Fine, Mother. You can do whatever you want but We're not moving.
E: shrugs Smacks
N: Mason moves his fork around in his bowl.
C: MASON
D: What about our friends?
C: MOM
D: Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write. We can come back to visit. And guess what?
N: She reaches out to touch Samantha's arm.
C: MOM
D: This place that Grandma found us, you'll each have your own room. Right?
E: CONT'D
N: Samantha shrugs.
C: MOM
D: And there's a pool.
E: CONT'D
N: Samantha shrugs again, clearly not sold on the idea.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Mason and Mom are lying on his bed together.
C: MASON
D: Mom, do you still love Dad?
C: MOM
D: I still love your father... but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together.
C: MASON
D: What if after we move he's trying to find us and he can't?
C: MOM
D: Oh, that won't be a problem. He can call Grandma and she'll tell him or he can call Information. We won't be hard to find.
N: She pushes back his hair lovingly.
C: MASON
D: Is he still in Alaska?
C: MOM
D: Well, that's what your uncle says.
C: MASON
D: Probably taming polar bears or something.
C: MOM
D: Yeah... well, I hope they're taming him.
S: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
N: The moving van drives off as mom puts another item in the pile of stuff to be left at the curb.
S: INT. HOUSE - DAY
N: Mom and Mason are getting ready to paint in the empty bedroom. They're looking at the two lone murals, which look a little odd without the bunk bed in front of them.
C: MOM
D: Here, wanna help me out?
C: MASON
D: Sure.
C: MOM
D: Okay. Take this paint... very carefully... and paint any little smudge or mark or anything on the baseboard there, behind the door, and all around the doorways on the inside.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Meanwhile, Samantha is talking on the phone.
C: SAMANTHA
D: She says we're gonna come visit and I'm gonna write and call you. Oh, wait, hold on a second. I'm getting another call. Hello? Sorry, Tommy, Mason can't come over today. We're moving. And I'm on the other line. Bye. Althea? I'm gonna be sending Sailor Scout instructions. Email, and write back telling me how the other scouts are doing. Well, because you're the leader now.
E: on phone Pushes Flash Pushes Button
N: During the last bit of this conversation, Mason slowly paints over the "growth chart" lines on the bedroom door jamb.
S: EXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAY
N: Carrying their final belongings from inside the house, they slowly exit the front door and head over to the car.
C: MOM
D: Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get there before it gets dark.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Goodbye yard, goodbye crepe myrtle, goodbye mailbox. Goodbye box of stuff Mommy won't let us take with us but we don't wanna throw away. Goodbye house, I'll never like mommy as much for making us move.
C: MOM
D: Samantha! Why don't you say goodbye to that little horse shit attitude? Okay? 'Cause we're not taking that in the car.
N: Just before he gets in the car, Mason is looking out at the neighborhood.
C: MASON
D: Goodbye old lady who listens to rock music and rides a motorcycle.
N: Soon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches him out the window, but says nothing as Tommy recedes into the distance.
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Mason and Samantha are restless and energetic, letting their childish energy get the best of them as they wrestle, hit, and squeal at each other in the back seat of the car. It is all well-intentioned though, as the two share a laugh after Mom tells them to quiet down.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Eeeee! Don't!
C: MOM
D: Hey! Hey, what's happening back there? Stop, put the barrier up.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Ahh! Stop! No!
N: Mason punches the pillow barrier between himself and Samantha, while his Mom speaks.
C: MOM
D: Hey, put the pillow between you. Make a barrier, come on. Stop. We're gonna play a game called The Game of Silence. Whoever can stay quiet for the longest period of time wins. You guys think you can do that? Okay, go!
N: The family's car moves on toward the Houston skyline just as dusk arrives.
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: Mason appears grumpy, trying to shove what he needs for the day into his backpack quickly.
C: MOM
D: The bus'll be here in ten minutes.
E: O.S.
C: MOM
D: Put that homework in your backpack!
E: CONT'D steps into doorway
C: MOM
D: Go eat! Baby, go eat!
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: MASON
D: I am!
S: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: Samantha places pancakes on their plates while talking to Mason in a cryptic language, reminiscent of pig latin.
C: SAMANTHA
D: ...I affatay servay yoohay.
C: MASON
D: Speak English! Shut up. Mom! She's speaking that stupid language again!
C: MOM
D: Samantha!
C: SAMANTHA
D: I was speaking perfectly clear English, Mother. You know, he's a little slow in the head. He did officially flunk first grade.
C: MOM
D: Sit your butt down.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yes sir, Mother sir!
N: She salutes.
C: MOM
D: All right, listen up guys. Grandma's gonna pick you up after school. Your dad is in town for the day so you're gonna spend the afternoon with him.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hmm.
C: MASON
D: Is he moving back?
C: MOM
D: I don't know.
C: SAMANTHA
D: We haven't seen him in about eighty years.
C: MOM
D: Like... a year and a half.
C: MASON
D: Ha-ha.
E: points to Samantha
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh please...
C: MOM
D: Can we please eat, here? The bus is coming. Who wants syrup?
S: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Mason plays Oregon Trail on a classroom computer, while his TEACHER speaks in the background.
C: TEACHER
D: All right, nice cursive. Okay, Mason, when I check the mobiles, am I gonna find yours?
E: O.S.
C: MASON
D: No.
C: TEACHER
D: And why not?
C: MASON
D: 'Cause I didn't finish it.
C: TEACHER
D: Well, it's time to finish it.
C: MASON
D: Just a minute.
C: TEACHER
D: No, let's do Apple Quit.
N: Mason cuts a sheet of construction paper in the shape of the state of Texas, presumably to finish his mobile. He sits across from a female classmate, GIRL IN RED, who teases him.
C: GIRL IN RED
D: Time to finish your work, Mason. "Apple Quit."
S: INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Samantha sits with her GRANDMA, Catherine, showing off her good grades on various school reports. Mason sits in his own chair, playing with a Gameboy.

S: EXT. STREET/FRONT PORCH - DAY
N: A Pontiac GTO pulls up outside.
C: GRANDMA
D: That's him.
E: O.S.
N: DAD gets out of the car and hurries to the door. Samantha squeals, as she runs out to greet him.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Daddy! Hi!

E: O.S.
C: DAD
D: Aw, you know what, why don't I take them over to their mom's?
N: A moment of tension passes between them.
C: GRANDMA

S: INT. BOWLING ALLEY CAFE - EVENING
N: The family sits around a table enjoying their snacks, while Dad smokes a cigarette.
C: DAD
D: Alright, let me tell you what's happening in Iraq, alright? Exactly what every thinking person in the world knew was gonna happen before they got started. Bush and his little numb-nut fanatics he's got around him, they don't give a rat's ass.
E: O.S.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That's a quarter.
C: DAD
D: What's a quarter?
C: SAMANTHA
D: You said a-s-s.
C: DAD
D: Oh, sorry. My bad.
C: SAMANTHA
D: And my teacher says it's a good war, because it's better to be safe than sorry.
C: DAD
D: That's what they're teaching you in school? Alright, listen to me. Listen to your father, okay? That is the lie. That's the big lie. Iraq had nothing to do with what happened at the World Trade Center. You know that, right?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I guess.
C: DAD
D: Alright. Who are you gonna vote for next fall, MJ?
C: MASON
D: I don't know.

C: DAD
D: Anybody but Bush! Okay?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Are you gonna move back?
C: DAD
D: Uh... I'm plannin' on it. You know, I gotta find a job.
C: MASON
D: Are you and mom gonna get back together?
C: DAD
D: I don't know. That's not, uh... entirely up to me, you know?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I remember when I was six, you and mom were fighting like mad. You were yelling so loud and she was crying.
C: DAD
D: That's what you remember, huh?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yep.
C: DAD
D: You don't remember the trips to Galveston, camping in Big Bend, all the fun we had?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Nope.
C: DAD
D: You ever get mad at your mother?

E: V.O. MORE
C: BILL
D: Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus, that he used? Come on now, people! Tough weekend? What's the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat. Meat powder, actually. Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog. Okay. He put the meat powder in there and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog, which was? Salivation. Alright. Now, who can give me another example of an unconditioned stimulus-response pair that happens to you everyday. It's probably happening to some of you right now. How about sex? Sure, you know. You see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response. You don't have to think about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song about... Oh, when they call your name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog.

N: Mason laughs. He and Bill shake hands.
C: MOM
D: He wasn't feeling well today, so I thought I'd bring him with me.
N: Bill touches Mason's forehead.
C: BILL
D: Ah! No fever. It's a con job. I can tell because I have a nine year old son, he pulls this all the time. Same kind of deal. Hey, you play soccer?
C: MASON
D: Mm, no.
C: BILL
D: Neither does my boy. He hates soccer. He likes computers. My 11-year-old daughter, loves soccer. Who can figure? Hey, maybe we can get all you guys together sometime, huh?
C: MOM
D: Maybe, yeah. Well, you ready to go?
C: MASON

E: O.S.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't know... talk, dance, listen to music.
C: DAD
D: Uh-huh. And that's more fun to you than going camping with your brother and your father who love you?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yes. Sorry.
C: DAD
D: Wow. Is there gonna be alcohol there?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Probably not. Maybe some of the seniors.
C: DAD
D: Mm-hmm. I know what this party is. The parents are out of town, right? Somebody's uh, scored a keg, right... You guys are gonna have a good time, trash the whole house... Right? Am I right?

D: Yes.
C: DAD
D: What's the one thing that you know about Sarah Palin's seventeen year old daughter?
C: SAMANTHA
D: She's pregnant?
C: DAD
D: That's right. And what is the one thing that you are not going to be in a couple of years when you turn seventeen?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Pregnant?
C: DAD
D: That's right! Alright, now what are the, the two ways that you can achieve that goal? The first is... not have any sex. Okay? That's the first way. Okay? Just not engage in that. That did not work out very well for your mother and me. And what's the second way?
N: Mason stands to leave the table.
C: DAD
D: Where are you going?
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Bathroom.
C: DAD

C: SAMANTHA
D: Ohh! God! Dad!
C: DAD
D: What? What, come on Sam. We have to be able to talk about this. Alright? Come on, we do. We can do it. We can do it. Just stay with me here. Alright? It's as hard for me as it is for you. But, seriously though, alright, I read an article in the paper the other day... that said that although U.S. teenagers are not the most sexually active, we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy. Okay?
N: A woman, TAMMY, walks up to the table, interrupting their conversation.
C: TAMMY
D: Hey. What's goin' on?
C: DAD
D: Oh, hey. Hey, Tammy. How you doin'?

D: Okay. Great. It was really nice meeting you both. Take care.
C: DAD
D: I'll see you.
C: TAMMY
D: Talk to you soon. Bye.
N: Tammy walks away. Mason smirks at his dad.
C: DAD
D: Don't -- don't, don't look at me like that, alright? I just -- look, just to finish the point -- okay? I was twenty-three when your mom had you, alright? So was she, alright? And we didn't put ourselves in the best position to be great parents, and I wish that -- I wish I were a better parent to you guys. Alright? And I, I hope that you can learn from my mistakes. Okay? So, wear a condom. Or get Garrett to -- I don't know. Whatever.

C: DAD
D: Really? Where?
C: MASON
D: All over.
E: shrugs
C: DAD
D: All over Texas?
C: MASON
D: Yeah.
C: DAD
D: Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know? It's no big deal. We can handle that. I'll still come get you every other weekend. I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something, it'll just be a little more car time. No big deal.
C: MASON
D: I'm just kinda sick of moving.
C: DAD
D: Well, I bet you are. But you know, you never know. I mean, I might have to move, right? I'm working for this insurance company now. These places get bought and sold all the time. You know? We'll just roll with it.
N: They take off pants, walk up to the water in boxer shorts.
C: MASON
D: I thought you were a musician?
C: DAD
D: I am but... life is expensive, you know. Guy's got to be responsible. What do you think?

C: DAD

C: MASON
D: Well, when we're at school, we got plenty to talk about, but when we're alone or on the phone, it's like we have nothing in common.
C: DAD
D: Nothing?
C: MASON
D: Uh, she's not interested in music or video games or... the three best movies this summer...
C: DAD
D: All right. What?
C: MASON
D: Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and Pineapple Express.
C: DAD

C: MASON
D: Yeah.
C: DAD
D: Yeah? Alright. Well, here's what you do. Alright. First off, you gotta ask her a lot of questions. Then you have to listen to the answers, alright, actually be interested in her. Alright, if you can do those things, you're gonna be light years ahead of all the other guys.

C: MASON
D: Yeah.
N: Dad laughs.
C: DAD
D: You think they ever will make another "Star Wars"?
C: MASON
D: I don't know. I mean, I think if they were to make another one that the period where the game is set is where it would have to be, 'cause there's nothin' after, really. At the end --
C: DAD
D: Yeah, no, "Return of the Jedi" it's over. There's nothin' --

S: INT. REST ROOM - DAY
N: Mason fixes his hair in the mirror. Two BULLIES are vandalizing the walls. Bully #1 turns and wanders over to Mason, suddenly bumping into him. BULLY #1 Don't bump into me! Little bitch!
C: MASON
D: I didn't!
N: BULLY #1 You callin' me a liar?
C: MASON
D: No.
N: BULLY #1 Don't act like you're tough shit, motherfucker. Bully #2 walks over to join the altercation. BULLY #2 I don't think pretty boy's hair's good enough. Bully #2 tries to mess with Mason's hair. Mason blocks his hand. BULLY #2 (CONT'D) Hey! Don't touch me, faggot! Another student enters. The two bullies start to walk away.

D: You know Courtney? Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring? Wears Hot Topic every day?
C: MASON
D: I... think so.
C: JILL
D: We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kinda grown apart. She sorta got all emo. She thinks I'm a prep. But, I still consider her a friend! Anyway, she cut one of her wrists. I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit.
N: Jill glances down at the book in Mason's hand.
C: JILL
D: So what are you reading?
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Oh, it's uh, "Breakfast of Champions". Kurt Vonnegut.
C: JILL
D: I think my older brother likes him. I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" for the third time. My friends make fun of me. I think I'm the only girl in the whole school who doesn't like the "Twilight" books. Have you read them?
C: MASON
D: Sure haven't.
C: JILL
D: I tried... but it was so cheesy! So how do you like San Marcos?
C: MASON
D: I like it alright. It's a lot smaller than Houston, but it seems pretty cool. Have you always lived here?
C: JILL
D: Yeah. If you want the big city around here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin. Have you been there yet?
C: MASON
D: I went to San Antonio for a day, but... I haven't been to Austin yet.
C: JILL

C: MASON
D: Not currently.
C: JILL
D: Well then, you should come. I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there.
C: MASON
D: Okay.
C: JILL

C: MASON
D: I won't.
C: JILL
D: Well, I better get going. See you later.
C: MASON
D: Bye.
S: INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Mason walks into his mother's classroom. He takes a seat to observe from the back, while she lectures.
C: MOM
D: His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, Ethology theorists' work... And then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study. Now you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950's, this was radical! This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning. Now, Bowlby is going to argue that human survival depends on us falling in love. It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me. And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed. Now think about it. A tiger chases our tribe out of a cave. Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My baby! I love you! I'll protect you!" Or... "Well you, why am I going to pick you up? You're going to slow me down. You... are... tiger kibble!"
E: O.S.
N: The class laughs.
C: MOM
D: So next week we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment -- oh oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I -- some of you might have classes with Elena -- she and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by. I'm not the greatest cook...
E: CONT'D pause
N: The class laughs again.
S: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
N: Mason opens the door as he and his mother enter the house.

C: MOM
D: Samantha!
E: CONT'D
N: Samantha is sitting on her bed, listening to music with a friend, GABY.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay! Mom...
C: MOM
D: Why in the hell didn't you pick up your brother like you said you would?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Mom, I know what you're gonna say. She was running late and we couldn't turn around.
C: MOM
D: No, no! No excuses! The bottom line is you didn't do what you said you were gonna do. You stranded your brother!
C: SAMANTHA
D: It's embarrassing to ask my friend to turn around and go get some kid at the middle school.
C: MOM
D: What do you mean "some kid"? He's your brother! And you know what? We've helped Janie out before. I mean, she lives right around the corner. It's no big deal.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Sorry.
C: MOM
D: You know what, Samantha? You need to start thinking long and hard about who you want to be.
E: MORE
C: MOM
D: Do you want to be a cooperative person, who is compassionate and helps people out? Or do you want to be a self-centered narcissist?
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: You know what? You're right. I am this horrible person... But honestly, he's not a baby anymore. You don't have to treat him like one. He's in eighth grade and he can find his way home if he wants to.
C: MOM
D: You know what? When Gaby leaves, you and me are gonna have a chat.
N: Mom leaves the room.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Awkward...
E: to Gaby
N: Gaby and Samantha laugh together.
C: GABY
D: Dude, that sucks.

S: INT. MOM'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mom is sitting on her bed grading papers.
C: MASON
D: Hey, Mom. Can I go camping with Chase tonight?
C: MOM
D: Camping? Where?
C: MASON
D: Uh, at that house that his family's building. It's pretty much finished.
C: MOM

C: MASON
D: His brother's a senior.
E: shrugs

C: BOYS
D: Ohh shit, alright. Nice.
C: CHARLIE
D: Alright, alright.
C: CHASE
D: Alright, alright. Now check this out. You might want to move.
N: Chase picks up a circular saw blade and throws it into a large piece of sheet-rock with the outline of a body on it.
C: CHASE
D: Oww, that'd be painful. That's like the liver, stomach, something --
E: CONT'D
C: TONY
D: That's like the belly button --
C: MASON
D: Check this out, man.
N: Mason also heaves the blade into the human outline.
C: TONY
D: Whoa! Pancreas!
C: MASON
D: That shit's lethal.
C: CHASE
D: Yeah, that would be painful.
C: CHARLIE
D: Man, have a beer, man. That was awesome. Here.
E: To Mason
N: Mason takes the beer and opens it, winning the boys' approval.
C: SENIOR GUY

D: Nice.
N: Chase offers a beer to Tony.
C: TONY
D: Aw, no thanks.
C: CHASE
D: Come on, man.
C: CHARLIE
D: What, are you a pussy?
C: TONY
D: No, I just don't feel like drinking a beer right now.
C: CHARLIE
D: Man, if you're too chicken shit to even have a beer, I know for a fact that you have never gotten any pussy.
C: TONY
D: Like you guys have.
C: CHASE
D: Sure have.
C: TONY
D: When?
C: CHASE
D: Last summer.
C: MASON
D: With who?
C: CHARLIE
D: It was awesome. Chase went down easy street and fucked this whore Nancy. At least that's what he said.
C: CHASE
D: I did. Would I lie?
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Bullshit. Quick, where were you?
C: CHASE
D: At Tobler's house. And, she fucked a couple other guys, too.
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh man, his first piece of ass was sloppy seconds.
N: The boys all laugh.
C: CHARLIE
D: What about you, Mason? You ever got any?
E: CONT'D
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Yeah, you ever made her, uh, howl into the night?
C: MASON
D: A few times.
C: TONY
D: Really?
E: skeptical
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Yeah, right. What was her name, Lucky?
C: MASON
D: Nooo. Jennifer. She doesn't live here, though. She's back in Houston.
C: CHARLIE
D: You're fucking lying.
C: MASON
D: I don't care if you assholes believe me or not.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Let me guess -- you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here... lefty.
N: Senior Guy motions with his left hand.
C: MASON
D: Hey, fuck you. I would, but none of the girls here want to.
C: CHARLIE
D: Dude, it's not what they want, man. It's what you want.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: True dat.
N: Senior Guy toasts, as Mason rolls his eyes.
C: CHARLIE
D: You know what you should do? Join a band. That's all it takes, man.
C: MASON
D: Oh yeah?
C: CHARLIE
D: Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even have to play that well. I mean, you start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs. Except for you. It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.
E: Points to Tony
C: TONY
D: I'm not in the fucking marching band.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute.
C: TONY
D: Alright, I got a question for you guys. If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night?
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to even be here. This is our camp out. The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit!
N: Senior Guy throws a beer just past Tony.
C: CHARLIE
D: It's all good, man. These little fuzz nuts are going to get their chance soon enough. We got some whores coming by later.
C: CHASE
D: Yeah?
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Hell yeah!
C: CHARLIE
D: Now, I know Chase will fuck anything. I mean, I've seen this kid mount boulders before. But what about you guys? You in?
C: MASON
D: Whatever.
C: CHARLIE
D: Alright.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Alright, good man. What about you, Peter Puffer?
C: TONY
D: I don't know. Maybe.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there.
C: TONY
D: I'm not gay.
C: CHARLIE
D: Give it some time, man. You'll realize.
C: TONY
D: Fuck y'all.
C: CHARLIE
D: See, that's exactly my point, man. Nah, but we don't have whores coming over, we were just fucking with you to see what you'd say.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Yeah, and you just earned your Vag Badge.
C: CHARLIE
D: Put it next to your bitch card.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Yeah, 'cause you know, you're a bitch. Now hold this, like the bitch you are, bitch.
N: The boys return to breaking boards.
C: SENIOR GUY
D: Alright, this shit is called the Death Punch.
E: CONT'D

E: points to the mural
C: MASON
D: Thanks.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: You did that?
C: MASON
D: Yeah.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Wow. How long have you been doing that for?
C: MASON
D: Not very long. Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: They have a camp for graffiti?
C: MASON
D: Well, they call it "urban art".
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Oh.
C: MASON
D: So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but... it was really just a way to get free spray paint.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Cool. So is this your tag? Is that -- do they still call it...?
C: MASON
D: Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Oh. K...
C: MASON
D: E.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: E. Z. J. O. Kezjo. That's cool.
C: MASON
D: It doesn't really mean anything, though.
N: The College Girl notices a picture of Mason and his Dad leaning against the GTO.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Is that your dad?
C: MASON
D: Yeah.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Where's he live?
C: MASON
D: In Houston.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Get to see him much?
C: MASON
D: Yeah, yeah. Some weekends, and over the summer.
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Cool.
C: MASON
D: So you're a student of my mom's, right?
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Mm-hm. Yeah, she's uh, I got one class with her. Yeah, she's cool.
C: MASON
D: How's she doing? You know, is she -- is she a good teacher and everything?
C: COLLEGE GIRL
D: Yeah! She's great. She's super smart and she cares, you know, she makes it interesting. She's probably even my favorite teacher.
N: Mason nods.
S: INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
N: One of Mom's students, JIM, tells a story while the group sits around the table eating.
C: JIM
D: ...So anyway, we figured out a way to rig up our iPods to the external speakers on the ASV. So every time we come rolling into town, you knew the 456 was there, 'cause we were bumping House of Pain. It was like, "Jump around, Jump around." And the whole family's coming outside, and you got the kids and the mom and the dad, and they're all bouncing up and down. We're throwing out candies for the kids, and soccer balls, and Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um, like, smokes for the adults. And they loved, they absolutely loved, Gatorade. But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor. I don't know what it was. Yeah. Couldn't give it away.
N: The group laughs.
C: MOM
D: How long were you over there?
C: JIM
D: Uhh... I did two tours in Iraq and one in Bosnia.
C: MOM
D: Wow.
C: MASON
D: Did you enlist?
C: JIM
D: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army National Guard. And, uh, you know coming straight out of high school. Needed money for college. Seemed like a decent paying job. And, uh, did my tour. And whenever I got done, I told them if there's, you know, a world-changing event, I'll come back. And, uh, 3 months later 9/11 happened. And I was back 9/12. And I'm proud to say the 456, the whole time we were there, we never lost a guy. Not one casualty.
C: MOM
D: But is that odd? Is that unusual?
C: JIM
D: Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice. They, you know, did basically the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month.
C: MOM
D: Wow. What did you guys do differently?
C: JIM
D: Well, I'd like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know. I mean, all the time we spent over there building trust, I mean these guys basically destroyed it in three days.
C: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
D: So, what did the locals think about why we were there?
C: JIM
D: Oil. Plain and simple.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: The College Girl is now playing guitar and singing "Wish You Were Here" along with others in the living room. At some point, Mason notices Mom talking with Jim outside on the porch.

D: Hey, Mason. One last hit.
E: hands Mason a joint
N: Mason takes a hit of the joint.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey! Mickey Mouse Club. Get the fuck out of my car. Just crawl out the back window or something, man.
E: in the driver's seat
N: Mason climbs out the back window of the station wagon.
C: BLONDE GIRL
D: I'm gonna miss you.
C: MASON
D: I'll see you on Sunday night.
C: BLONDE GIRL
D: Alright. You better text me.
C: MASON
D: Mm. Do you have any gum?
C: BLONDE GIRL
D: Um... yeah, I do, actually. Here you go.
C: MASON
D: Thanks. See ya.
N: Mason kisses her good-night.
S: INT. JIM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Mom is hosting a small get-together, and is currently talking with Professor Douglas.
C: MOM
D: ...And they're buying this party line that they're supposed to feel bad and trade off their own pension, as if that's what's corrupting this nation.
C: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
D: Yeah, because those who hear Fox, in my opinion, are being lied to.
C: MOM
D: Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin. I mean, we have to follow that example.
C: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
D: You're right.
N: Mason enters the front door.
C: JIM
D: Hey, Mason. What time is it?
C: MASON
D: Uh, like 12:15.
C: JIM
D: Happy birthday.
N: Mason smiles.
C: MOM
D: Huh! Happy birthday!
N: Mom kisses Mason. Professor Douglas walks over to join them, taking an interest.
C: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
D: Mason, it's your birthday?
C: MASON
D: Uh, just now, I guess.
C: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
D: Yeah, how old are you?
C: MASON
D: Fifteen.
C: PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
D: Fifteen! Give me a hug.
N: Professor Douglas hugs Mason.

E: CONT'D
N: Professor Douglas rejoins the party.
C: MOM
D: Have you been drinking?
E: to Mason
C: MASON
D: Have you?
C: MOM
D: Yeah, a little. Have you?
C: MASON
D: A little bit.
C: MOM
D: Have you been...?
N: Mom mimes smoking reefer.
C: MASON
D: A little bit.
C: MOM
D: Oh... okay.
C: MASON
D: I'm gonna go to sleep.
C: MOM
D: Talk in the morning, huh?

E: to Annie
S: EXT. JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS
N: Mom talks with two workers about an exposed pipe in the yard.

C: MOM
D: Todo... Total?
E: attempting Spanish
C: WORKER
D: Everything, yes... Mira.

E: CONT'D
C: MOM
D: Gusto... it's stronger?

C: JIM
D: He's all into the photography thing right now.
C: DAD
D: Yeah, I know.
C: JIM
D: He's actually talking about turning his, uh, his closet into a dark room. The red light and developing, the whole nine...
C: DAD
D: Yeah? You alright with that?
C: JIM
D: I probably won't see him for a week...
C: DAD
D: Yeah... Right... Well...
C: JIM
D: But, you know. He's having a good time.
C: DAD
D: At least he's focusing on something.
C: JIM
D: Yeah, yeah.
C: DAD
D: You know? That's what I like.
C: JIM
D: Yeah, he's all about it.
S: EXT. JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS
C: MOM

E: pointing to the pipe
C: WORKER
D: It's good?
C: MOM
D: It's good.
C: WORKER
D: It's good. It's better. Yes.
N: He instructs the other worker on how to get started. Mom turns to join the others in front yard.
C: MOM
D: Hey, you know, you're smart. You should be in school.
C: WORKER
D: I like school, I need school, but it's hard. I work all day...
C: MOM
D: Go to night school. At community college. It's -- It's pretty affordable.
S: EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
C: DAD
D: You're doing a nice job with the house though, it's looking great... really great.
C: JIM
D: Thanks. Yeah, you know, some fix- its here and there, you know. We got a good deal on the foreclosure... So, now I'm finding out why. You know?
C: DAD
D: Yeah. Right?
E: laughs
N: Mason walks outside, carrying a duffel bag.

D: Bye, honey. I'm so glad you were born!
N: Dad, Annie, and the kids drive off for Houston. Mom and Jim are left standing in the front yard, as they watch the van drive away.
S: INT. MINI-VAN - DAY
C: MASON
D: So, this is like Annie's car and... and you drive the GTO? I guess you can't really put a baby seat in that thing.
C: DAD
D: Yeah, no... But I had to sell that anyway.
C: MASON
D: You what?
C: DAD
D: Yeah, I had to sell that.
C: MASON
D: So... so it's gone?
C: DAD
D: Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid twenty-two grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash. I only paid eighty-five hundred for that thing way back when. I mean, you know, cars are generally a terrible investment. You know? Soon as you drive them off the lot you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there.
E: MORE
C: DAD
D: But... if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, you know, the value starts going up again. I mean shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra.
E: CONT'D
N: After a long silence, Dad notices Mason is unusually quiet.
C: DAD
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: You don't remember?
C: DAD
D: Remember what?
C: MASON
D: Really? You said that was going to be my car when I turned sixteen.
C: DAD
D: What? No, I didn't. I never said that.
E: laughs
C: MASON
D: I remember. I was in third grade and you were taking me over to Anthony Nagar's house for his birthday... and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block. And he was talking about how much he loved your car and so you were all like "Oh. This is going to be Mason's when he turns 16."
C: DAD
D: What are you..? Alright, first off, I have no memory of that, alright? Second of all, I would never say that. Never.
C: MASON
D: Yeah. You did though.
C: DAD
D: What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?
E: MORE
C: DAD
D: Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean, you're not... Ughh. Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, alright, but bottom line is that was my car. Alright? I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it but when you get older you can save up and buy a car of your own. And be cool like I used to be. Or... you can get a mini-van.
E: CONT'D laughs
N: Annie and Samantha watch a Lady Gaga music video on Samantha's cell phone in the back seat.
C: ANNIE
D: Does your mom actually let you watch this?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah. She likes it too.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, my god... Okay, well.
E: laughing
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah.
C: ANNIE
D: Have you ever seen her in concert?
C: SAMANTHA
D: No. But she's coming to Houston in April.
C: ANNIE
D: She's coming to Houston?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Mm-hmm.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh you know, your dad and I could get you tickets, and you could stay with us.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That'd be great.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
C: DAD
D: Hey, hey, Annie? Will you get me the, the little birthday present for Mason?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, babe.
N: Annie hands a small wrapped present to Dad. Mason unwraps the gift to reveal a CD set.
C: DAD
D: Alright. This one, this one needs a little explanation, okay? Open it up. I call that "The Beatles' Black Album". Alright, what it is, is the best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo solo, post-break up.
C: MASON
D: Thanks.
C: DAD
D: Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you.
N: Annie Laughs.
C: DAD
D: You know, whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know? But you put 'em next to each other, alright, and they start to elevate each other... and then you can hear it. Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: I don't know. I think I always just liked Paul the best.
C: DAD
D: It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point. There is no favorite Beatle! That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world. Okay? You know, and there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered. Alright?
E: MORE
C: DAD
D: And now it has been carefully found, arranged, and ordered for you, by your loving father.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father.
C: DAD
D: Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks... You've got "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into "Photograph". I mean, come on. It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John who says no, it's about love and pain, and then Ringo who just says hey, can't we enjoy what we have while we have it? It's a good record. I shit you not.
C: MASON
D: Cool.
S: EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY
N: The mini-van drives along a dirt road lined with trees and parks outside of a small ranch home. GRANDPA CLIFF and NANA come outside to greet their guests.
C: DAD

C: DAD

N: Mason blows out the candles. The family cheers.
C: NANA
D: Real good! Presents! Wait, wait, wait. Here, sweetie.
N: Nana hands Mason a wrapped gift.
C: DAD
D: Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? Hey? Alright.
N: Sam walks into the kitchen to grab a knife.
C: NANA
D: I hope you like it. I heard you didn't have one, so.
N: He unwraps the gift.
C: NANA
D: It's a Bible. Is this your first Bible? Look, there's your name...
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Wow.
C: NANA
D: ...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait. Look at this. It's a Red Letter edition, and that means that everything Jesus said is in red.
C: MASON
D: Thank you.
C: NANA
D: Like it? Alright. I love you, sweetie. Happy Birthday.
C: ANNIE
D: And this one's from us.
N: Annie hands Mason a large gift box.
C: DAD
D: It's not going to make all your dreams come true, here, you know. Just keep your expectations low. No, no, no, no, you need it. It's...
N: Dad pulls a blue dress shirt, blazer, and tie out of the box.
C: DAD
D: It's -- hey! Come, on right? You gotta have it. You need this.
E: CONT'D
C: NANA
D: Wow!
C: DAD
D: You've got life ahead of you. You know --
C: ANNIE
D: And the shirt is blue, and I know you like blue.
C: DAD
D: You've got dances --
C: NANA
D: It's beautiful!
C: DAD
D: -- And job interviews. Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here.
N: Grandpa comes out of the kitchen with a covered gun.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Mason?
C: DAD
D: The Black Album was from me.
E: whispers
C: NANA
D: Uh-oh.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Come here, son. Pull that off.
N: Mason walks over and pulls the case off to reveal a shotgun.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: There's a 20 gauge shotgun.
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Wow.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him, and well, you're fifteen and I'd like for you to have it. Alright? Here, you hold it. Yeah.
C: MASON
D: Thank you.
E: taking the gun
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Congratulations, son. I'll teach you how to clean it, teach you how to fire it. I'll teach you a little bit of safety.
N: The family laughs, as Mason holds the gun pointing precariously across the room.
S: EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY
N: Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets.
C: DAD
D: Now cock it. Alright, there you go. Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight, here, you see this little V right here --
C: SAMANTHA
D: Mm-hm.
C: DAD
D: Now which one you aiming at?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Ah, the middle can.
C: DAD
D: The middle can? Alright, alright. Now fire at will, alright?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay.
N: Samantha shoots the can.

N: Dad claps as Samantha lowers the pistol.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah!
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Howdy!
C: DAD
D: Alright, watch out, watch out. Whoa. Be careful. Alright.
N: Mason holds the shotgun, taking aim. Grandpa Cliff throws a chunk of wood up into the air as a target.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Ready? Pull!
N: Mason misses the fist shot.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: You uh, you uh, hit a little low. Wait until it gets up high and then shoot. Alright? Cause then it's a better aim coming down. Remember, second trigger.
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Mm-hm.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Ready?
C: MASON
D: Mm-hm.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Pull!
N: Grandpa Cliff throws another piece of wood into the air. This time, Mason hits it.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Hah! Hah! Look what you did! Well, you nailed it, didn't you? How's that feel?
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Felt good.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Yeah, it felt good. Good.
S: EXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The family sits out on the porch in a circle. Dad plays guitar as the family sings along.
C: DAD
D: Well, I want for us to be together forever.
E: singing
C: ANNIE
D: But to wander wherever I may.
E: singing
C: DAD
D: I want you to be easy and casual.
E: singing
C: ANNIE
D: But still demand I stay.
E: singing
C: SAMANTHA
D: I want for you to know me completely, but still remain mysterious.
E: singing
C: MASON
D: Consider everything deeply, but still remain fearless.
E: singing
C: DAD AND ANNIE
D: Climb to the top, look over the ledge. Dance barefoot on a razor's edge. Reach for the stars, grab the tiger by the tail.
E: singing
C: MASON
D: If I don't try, I'll never fail.
E: singing
C: DAD
D: Good!
C: DAD AND ANNIE
D: If you go home, you're rolling the dice. Can't step in the same river twice. If you love too much it'll turn to hate. If you never leave home you'll never be late. If you eat too much, you're gonna get fat. If you buy a dog, you'll piss off your cat.
E: singing
N: Grandpa Cliff and Nana both laugh.
C: DAD AND ANNIE
D: Take a deep breath, and enjoy the ride. Cause arrivals and departures run side by side...
E: CONT'D
N: Annie's parents cheer as the song concludes.
C: DAD
D: Alright, you're our first audience, you know? Mason demanded we work on it the whole drive.
E: O.S.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: It was really wonderful. That's sweet. Sweet.
C: NANA
D: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
C: GRANDPA CLIFF
D: Impressive.
C: DAD
D: It's a work in progress.
S: EXT. CHURCH - DAY
N: A small country church.
C: PREACHER
D: A week later -- we don't know why Thomas wasn't there the first time -- but a week later, Thomas comes back and joins the other disciples. They say, "Hey, the Lord's alive, we saw him!"
E: O.S.
S: INT. CHURCH - DAY
N: The preacher stands at the front of the church holding an open bible. The family sits among the congregation. Mason is wearing his new suit.
C: PREACHER
D: "I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side and I'm gonna see those nail prints in his hands." Poof! About that time, here comes Jesus, standing right next to him. Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't you know Thomas felt some shame? And he turns to Thomas and says, "Thomas, here, stick your finger in my side. Look at these nail prints. It's me." And Thomas says, "My Lord, and my God, I believe."
N: Annie's parents nod in agreement.
C: PREACHER
D: And Jesus said, "Well, that's good.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: PREACHER
D: But blessed are those who can believe without seeing." It's a lot easier when you can see, and feel, and touch. But like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh. We haven't felt him in the flesh. But we have experienced him in the spirit. At least I have, and I hope y'all have too.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: The family walks through the woods. Annie holds Cooper to her chest in a cloth carrier. Mason has his camera in hand. Dad chews on a piece of straw.
C: ANNIE
D: The pond's right up here. Ooh, it's low.
C: DAD
D: Yeah.
C: ANNIE
D: You know, my dad could take you fishing next time you're here if you want.
C: MASON
D: Nice.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi, baby. What's goin' on?
E: to Cooper
N: Mason and Samantha walk down to the pond. Annie sits on a picnic bench with Cooper.
C: ANNIE
D: You know, I think we're just gonna hang out here for a minute.
E: CONT'D
C: DAD
D: Want me to stay with you?
C: ANNIE
D: No, it's okay.
C: DAD
D: You sure?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, thanks.
N: Samantha pushes a stick into the mud. Mason photographs pond.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Mason, why are you such a stick-in- the-mud?
C: MASON
D: What are you even talking about?
C: DAD
D: Hey, you guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism?
C: MASON
D: No, it's fine.
C: DAD
D: Sam?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay.
C: DAD
D: I appreciate it. It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know.
C: MASON
D: Were we baptized?
N: They share a look and laugh.
C: DAD
D: I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul. We can do it now, though, if you want.
C: MASON
D: No, nah, I think I'm alright.
C: DAD
D: You and Cooper together, you know. Dunk your heads.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad?
C: DAD
D: And what's that supposed to mean, hm?
C: ANNIE
D: I can hear you!
C: DAD
D: Well, I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh. I don't think your mom would love that.
N: Dad picks up a rock.
C: DAD
D: Hey, look out, Sam. Let me show you how it's done.
E: CONT'D
N: Dad skips the rock across the pond. Mason photographs it.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Nice, Dad.
N: She laughs.
C: DAD
D: Still got the goods, hmm?
S: INT. DARKROOM - DAY
N: Mason is developing a picture in the darkroom. His teacher, MR. TURLINGTON, wanders in.
C: TURLINGTON
D: How long you been in here, Mason?
C: MASON
D: I'm not sure.
C: TURLINGTON
D: I'm sure. All class. Did you complete your image diary?
C: MASON
D: Not yet.
C: TURLINGTON
D: Completed your, uh, digital contact sheet?
C: MASON
D: Not quite, but... I mean, it's not gonna take me long.
C: TURLINGTON
D: Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time is extra-curricular. I mean technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments. That's the deal.
C: MASON
D: Sorry.
C: TURLINGTON
D: I'm worried about you, Mason.
C: MASON
D: Why is that?
C: TURLINGTON
D: I'll tell you why. The images you're turning in, they're cool. You're looking at things in a really unique way. Got a lot of natural talent.
C: MASON
D: Thanks.
C: TURLINGTON
D: Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic?
N: Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure.
C: TURLINGTON
D: I can tell you. I can count it on two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna happen for you, Mason. The world is too competitive. There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard. And a butt-load of morons who are untalented, who are more than willing to surpass you. As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now. Hm? You know what they're doing? They're doing their assignments, which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not. You're in here. Why is that? Are you special, Mason?
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: No, but I mean the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard. I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times.
C: TURLINGTON
D: You like football, Mason?
C: MASON
D: Not really.
C: TURLINGTON
D: Yeah, I know you don't. That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight. Okay? It starts at 7:30. I want you to get there early. I want you to shoot a full card, three hundred images, and I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday. Okay? You want to know why I'm doing this?
C: MASON
D: I guess.
C: TURLINGTON
D: Who do you want to be, Mason? What do you want to do?
C: MASON
D: I want to take pictures. Make art.
C: TURLINGTON
D: Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can?
C: MASON
D: That's what I'm trying to find out.
C: TURLINGTON
D: Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say, "Thank you, sir, for that terrific dark room chat we had that day." Get back to class and do your work.
E: walking away
S: INT. CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mason walks back to his computer. NICK sits at the neighboring computer.
C: NICK
D: Hey man. You're walkin' a little funny.
C: MASON
D: Fuck you.
C: NICK
D: I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time. Just hope he bought you dinner first.
N: Mason playfully jabs Nick in the arm.
S: INT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Jim sits at the kitchen table, opening a beer. Mom and Samantha prepare dinner in the kitchen. Mom walks over to the stairs to call up to Mason.
C: MOM
D: Mason! Honey, come down for dinner.
N: On her way back to the kitchen, Mom notices the screen on an open laptop.
C: MOM
D: Samantha! You didn't post these pictures and their descriptions? Come on, this auction is going to end on Sunday, honey. You've got to get those posted.
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: Why are we even doing this? It's like an online junk shop. I thought you had a good job?
C: MOM
D: I do. We're what you call house poor. Everyone's got to do their part. Your brother took the pictures. You have to help.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Who even buys this shit?
C: JIM
D: Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, alright? Don't disrespect your mother. You like a roof over your head, don't you?
C: MOM
D: Yeah, and you like having electricity so that you can charge your cell phone?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm not even gonna be here next year. I'm a senior. I should be having fun.
N: Mason enters. He sits down at the table. He has blue nail polish on his fingernails.
C: JIM
D: Nice nails.
C: MASON
D: Yeah, some girl did that in sixth period.
C: JIM
D: You planning on keeping them?
C: MASON
D: Until it comes off, I guess.
C: JIM
D: Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails. You got a, uh, you got a purse to go with all that?
C: SAMANTHA
D: A lot of guys do that. He's just trying to be cool.
C: JIM
D: When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool.
C: MOM
D: Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water.
N: Mason gets up to help set the table.
S: EXT. FOOTBALL GAME - NIGHT
N: An announcer comments on the game over the loud speaker. The crowd cheers and the band plays. Mason is on the sidelines, photographing details he finds interesting. He scrolls through the images on his camera.
C: NICK
D: Hey man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game. So take your lens and point it that way.
C: MASON
D: Jesus Christ.
C: NICK
D: Also, we got a ride tonight.
C: CHASE
D: McCormick gonna take us to the party. We're gonna head out after the game. You're goin', okay?
C: MASON
D: Okay.
C: NICK
D: Shoot the game.
N: A player catches the ball and is tackled.
S: EXT. PARTY - NIGHT
N: "She's Long Gone" by the Black Keys plays over the party. Mason fills a cup at the keg. Samantha takes a shot with a boy. Kids play beer bong.
C: BEER PONG GUY
D: Kobe...
N: It goes in - guests react.
C: GABY
D: Oh! First one. What was that? What was that? What is up?
N: Nick plays drums with teen band. Mason approaches SHEENA. He nudges her shoulder.
C: SHEENA
D: Hey, what's up?
C: MASON
D: Hey. How's it goin'?
C: SHEENA
D: Pretty good. How long have you been here?
C: MASON
D: I don't know. Awhile, I guess.
C: SHEENA
D: Awhile? Yeah.
S: EXT. QUIET SPOT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mason and Sheena sit and talk.
C: MASON
D: I just feel like there are so many things that I could be doing and probably want to be doing that I'm just not.
C: SHEENA
D: Why aren't you?
C: MASON
D: I mean, I guess it's... just being afraid of what people would think. You know, judgment.
C: SHEENA
D: Yeah. I guess it's really easy to say, like, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but, everyone does, you know? Deep down.
C: MASON
D: Exactly. I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with just for controlling me or whatever, but you know, they're not even aware they're doing it.
C: SHEENA
D: Yeah. So... in this perfect world where no one's controlling you, what's different? What changes?
C: MASON
D: Everything. I mean, I just wanna be able to do anything I want, because it makes me feel alive. As opposed to giving me the appearance of normality.
C: SHEENA
D: Whatever that means.
C: MASON
D: I don't think it means much.
C: SHEENA
D: You're kinda weird, you know that?
C: MASON
D: Yeah?
E: MORE
C: MASON
D: Is that a compliment?
E: CONT'D Laughing
C: SHEENA
D: I don't know. Do you wanna be weird?
C: MASON
D: I mean, I don't want to like... scare kids at the park, or anything like that.
N: Sheena laughs.
C: MASON
D: I really like talking with you. I don't usually even try to like vocalize my thoughts or feelings or anything. Just, I don't know, it just never sounds right. Words are stupid.
E: CONT'D
C: SHEENA
D: So, why're you trying with me?
C: MASON
D: I don't know. I guess I feel comfortable.
C: SHEENA
D: I'm glad.
S: EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Mason comes home late. Jim sits outside on a chair surrounded by empty beer cans and one in hand.
C: MASON
D: Hey, Jim. I'm sorry I'm so late.
C: JIM
D: What time were you supposed to be home?
C: MASON
D: I don't know. Awhile ago.
C: JIM
D: Awhile ago like, thirty minutes ago, an hour ago? Cause, truthfully, nobody even knew where you were until your sister told us. She's been home for awhile.
C: MASON
D: I'm sorry.
C: JIM
D: Yeah, been hearin' a lot of that lately. See, but you don't actually care. You just kinda... kinda come and go as you please and you don't care if your mom's upset or what time you gotta be home... Is that what's up?
C: MASON
D: I don't know what to tell you.
C: JIM
D: Stop mumbling! You know, speak up! I can't understand a word comin' outta your mouth. It's just like, "uh uhh nuhh" and I ask you questions and you just--
C: MASON
D: Man, can I just have one day where everyone isn't all over my ass!?
N: Jim gets up abruptly and advances on Mason.
C: JIM
D: I'm up your ass? This is my house. Now, if you wanna live in my house then you get home when you say you're gonna be home.
C: MASON
D: You know, Jim, you're not my dad.
C: JIM
D: No, I'm not your dad! You know how I know that? Cause I'm actually here. I'm the guy with the job, paying the bills, taking care of you, your mom, your sister... Huh?! Huh?!
N: Mason goes inside.
C: JIM
D: I'm that guy...
E: CONT'D
N: Jim sits down.
S: INT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Mom sits at the kitchen table surrounded by bills and papers. Mason comes down the stairs.
C: MASON
D: Morning.
C: MOM
D: Morning. Hey, which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last night?
C: MASON
D: I don't know. I didn't.
C: MOM
D: That tall guy, what's his name?
C: MASON
D: Phillip?
C: MOM
D: Yeah, Phillip. He did it. Can Phillip read? I mean, there's a big sign on the door, it says, "Do not use this bathroom, it's broken." I mean, how difficult is that?
C: MASON
D: I don't know. I'm sorry.
N: Mason prepares cereal.
C: MOM
D: I think I'm gonna put the house on the market.
C: MASON
D: Why?
C: MOM
D: This house is too big for us. I mean, you're going to school eventually... It's too expensive. I'm done.
C: MASON
D: Well why did you even buy it in the first place, then?
C: MOM
D: Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the
E: MORE
C: MOM
D: brink of poverty. I mean, I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap and now I'm gonna spend the second half of my life getting rid of all this stuff.
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Really? Like what?
C: MOM
D: Like - Well, I got rid of a couple husbands, now I'm gonna get rid of a mortgage, some maintenance, the tchotchkes, the, the homeowner's insurance, the property tax, the plumbing... Ahhh. You know what? From now on I am gonna be Mommy Monk. Simple. Celibate.
C: MASON
D: Don't be gross, Mom.
C: MOM
D: Fine. I'll be a poor whore with a big house. Is that better?
E: Laughs
C: MASON
D: Okay.
N: Mason starts to walk away.
C: MOM
D: Mason -- Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash.
C: MASON
D: I do dishes all day.
C: MOM
D: Well, great honey, then you're a professional. Come on, you could do one or two more for you poor old mom.
N: Mason walks over to the sink.
C: MASON
D: Okay.
C: MOM
D: Thank you.
S: EXT. MOM'S HOUSE
N: Mason gets in truck, drives away.
S: INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN
N: Music plays in the background. Mason is in uniform, he carries in a bus tub of dirty dishes, one with uneaten battered shrimp on it. He sticks one in his mouth and flirts with APRIL, a waitress.
C: MASON
D: You want one?
C: APRIL
D: Ugh. God --
C: MASON
D: She didn't even touch them, seriously. I watched her the whole time.
E: Laughing
N: April takes one.
C: APRIL
D: Yeah, I bet you did watch her, you little pervert. It's like we're on a date. Cheers.
E: Laughing
N: They clink battered shrimp.
C: MASON
D: It's a night of romance.
C: APRIL
D: Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you.
N: She heads back out to the restaurant floor.
C: APRIL
D: I will blow you, though.
E: CONT'D
N: Mason brings the dishes over to the industrial washers. His boss, MR. WOOD, storms in.
C: MR. WOOD
D: Mason! We are in the weeds out here!
C: MASON
D: I'm goin' as fast as I can.
C: MR. WOOD
D: Oh!
E: MORE
C: MR. WOOD
D: Then I must be confused then, cause I just saw you chattin it up with April when I gotta salad bar that needs a refill, I gotta six top, two four tops I can't use, because they haven't been bused.
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Enrique is not here. I'm tryin'.
C: MR. WOOD
D: Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'! What am I supposed to tell my customers? "Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it, but Mason's tryin'. Least that's what he told me, after he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp." Now it is a challenge out there today, I know, but I wanna share somethin' with you, I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, now that's a lot more responsibility. It's also more money. How's that sound?
C: MASON
D: Good.
C: MR. WOOD
D: I know you can handle that money... but can you take the responsibility? I think you can, because I believe in you. But I need you on the floor. Now leave the dishes. Giddyup. Right, come on, don't let me down!
N: Mason exits.
S: INT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Mason sits on the stairs video chatting with Dad on his phone.
C: DAD
D: Well, so it's -- it's runnin' okay? That alternator's not messin' up anymore?
C: MASON
D: No , it's fine. It's up for the trip.
E: Holding Phone
C: DAD
D: Well, you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin?
E: Laughing
C: MASON
D: Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool, and I guess her roommate's out of town so it's no big deal.
C: DAD
D: Alright, well, did you apply there yet? Did you get that application in to UT?
C: MASON
D: Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much in, though.
C: DAD
D: Yeah, right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing. You know? I mean seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants.
C: MASON
D: Yeah.
C: DAD
D: A bit of decisiveness goes a long way in this life, alright?
C: MASON
D: Yeah.
C: DAD
D: Great. And uh, what about work? How's that goin'?
C: MASON
D: Uh, I don't know. It's, it's alright. Today kind of sucked, this guy didn't show up. But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world. People are slobs.
C: DAD
D: Well, when people ask me about you I say, "Oh, Mason, he's doing great. He's got a job, he's really cleanin' up."
E: Laughing
N: Mason laughs.
C: DAD
D: Alright, hey, hey, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you?
E: CONT'D From Phone
N: Dad pans the phone to Annie and baby.
C: ANNIE
D: Say hi to your big brother. Hey, big brother.
C: MASON
D: Hey, Annie. Hey, kiddo.
C: ANNIE
D: Can you say bye-bye?
C: BABY
D: Bye-buh!
C: ANNIE
D: We'll see you soon.
E: Laughs
C: DAD
D: Alright, alright, well, be careful when you're driving, alright? Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. Alright? Just, you're Obi Wan. You're centered, patient, right? You watch three cars ahead, two behind. It takes two bad drivers to have an accident okay?
E: From phone
C: MASON
D: Okay.
C: DAD
D: Right, and listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something.
E: From phone
N: Mom comes down the stairs and drops a bag at Mason's feet.
C: MASON
D: Okay.
C: DAD
D: Alright, buddy! You have a good one.
C: MASON
D: Bye, Dad.
C: MOM
D: Hey, honey, take this to your sister. Throw it in the truck, okay?
E: Motioning to the bag
C: MASON
D: Okay, I will.
C: MOM
D: So where is Sheena staying?
C: MASON
D: At her friend Emily's.
C: MOM
D: Is Emily a real person?
C: MASON
D: Yeah. Yeah, she's a sophomore. She has an apartment.
E: Laughing
C: MOM
D: Okay, this is in case of emergency. Don't spend it. I want it back.
E: Holding out money
C: MASON
D: Okay. Thanks.
C: MOM
D: Did you do your homework?
C: MASON
D: Most of it, but... I can finish tomorrow night.
C: MOM
D: Honey! Eleventh grade is really important for college. Don't blow it.
C: MASON
D: I know! I know. I mean, we're going to UT and everything.
C: MOM
D: I know, and don't you want me to come? Come on, Sheena, road trip with Mom! I'll pay for gas.
C: MASON
D: Umm...
C: MOM
D: I'm just kidding. I have work.
N: She kisses his forehead.
C: MOM
D: Call me when you get there.
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: I will.
C: MOM
D: Have fun!
N: Mason exits.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/ INT. TRUCK
N: "Suburban Wars" plays. Mason drives, Sheena is in the passenger seat.
C: SHEENA
D: ... That sounds to me like just another extreme Mason view of everything.
C: MASON
D: Not at all! I finally figured it out. It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots... I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right now.
C: SHEENA
D: Oh, right now?
C: MASON
D: Yeah! I mean, why not? There are billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything. We don't cost anything. I mean we're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly. And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg upgrades.
C: SHEENA
D: How?
C: MASON
D: Seriously. I read this thing other day about how, like, when you hear that ding on your inbox you get a, like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked.
C: SHEENA
D: So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone.
C: MASON
D: I still make fun of Trevor, though.
C: SHEENA
D: But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something.
C: MASON
D: That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school paper.
C: SHEENA
D: And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.
C: MASON
D: That's the thing though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just want to try and not live my life through a screen. I want, like, some kind of actual interaction. A real person, not just the profile they put up.
N: Sheena's looking at her phone.
C: SHEENA
D: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying something?
N: She laughs.
C: MASON
D: Yeah, okay, I know you're joking, but, I mean, it's kinda true you have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, and so what are you really doing? You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching so... it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an in-between state. Not really experiencing anything.
C: SHEENA

C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah.
C: SHEENA
D: Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much.

C: SHEENA
D: What?
C: MASON
D: I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography. I just, I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big transformative experience.
C: SHEENA
D: I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step.
C: MASON
D: But it's like a pre-ordained slot that's already got your name and number on it. I don't think it's the key to my future. Cause, like, I mean, look at my mom. She got her degree, and got a pretty good job, she can pay her bills...
C: SHEENA

C: TEACHER
D: Yeah, kind of that voluptuous panic.
C: MASON
D: Yeah. Exactly.
C: TEACHER
D: Well, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be crazy good. I liked college a lot better than high school. You kinda find your people in college, you know?

D: I haven't told anyone.
C: MASON
D: So Cynthia just magically knows you're going to the prom with this loser even though you're not dating him anymore?
C: SHEENA
D: She's my best friend.
C: MASON
D: Well, your best friend has a big fucking mouth.
C: SHEENA
D: Take it up with her, then.
C: MASON
D: Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaws she can keep on talking as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend.
C: SHEENA
D: You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just tryin' to be friends with you.
C: MASON
D: Now it's just humiliating. I can't... I can't do that.
C: SHEENA
D: Mister I-Don't-Care-What-Anyone-Else- Thinks-Of-Me.
C: MASON
D: Fuck anyone else. I care what I think of me. Which isn't much right now. King of the Pity Prom.
C: SHEENA
D: Fine. We're not going.
C: MASON
D: Great.

E: a beat
C: MASON
D: Of course you don't.
E: Bitter Laugh
C: SHEENA
D: You know, it's actually kind of a relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time. The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.
C: MASON
D: It's great that you can think that way. And you know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind.
E: O.S.
C: SHEENA
D: He's not a jock, okay? He just happens to be on the lacrosse team. We're all going to other schools next year anyway, it's not some super serious relationship.
C: MASON
D: Great. I feel so much better now.
C: SHEENA
D: We're just having fun.
C: MASON
D: I bet he's having fun.
C: SHEENA
D: Grow up, Mason.
C: MASON
D: It's not like I haven't been with anyone else.
C: SHEENA
D: Who?
C: MASON
D: What do you care?
C: SHEENA
D: Who?
C: MASON
D: Does it matter?

D: That's totally cool.
C: DAD
D: Alright.
C: JIMMY
D: Wow! Is that M.J.?
C: DAD
D: Uh-huh. Right?
C: JIMMY
D: Unbelievable.
C: DAD
D: Well, we just decided to come a little early, check you out.
C: JIMMY
D: That's cool man, let me finish up, I'll be up in a minute.
C: DAD
D: Alright, alright.
N: He and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue.
C: DAD
D: I guarantee you, you didn't do anything wrong. These high school love things, they never work out. Here, come here.
E: CONT'D back to Mason MORE
C: DAD
D: I mean, everyone's just changing so much. The odds of two young people staying on the same wavelength are...
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Yeah, but still --
C: DAD
D: Look, and I also guarantee you that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl is a complete waste of time.
C: MASON
D: She wasn't a silly girl, though. I mean, she's a serious person. I really thought we were --
C: DAD
D: What?
C: MASON
D: I don't know.
C: DAD
D: Here's the truth. Women are never satisfied. Ok? They're always looking to potentially trade up and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you my fine feathered friend.
C: MASON
D: What does that even mean?
C: DAD
D: It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila.
C: MASON
D: Sheena.
C: DAD
D: Alright. It means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me. You. And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena start lining up at your front door.
C: MASON
D: Great.
C: DAD
D: Yeah, you know, you just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way. Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter when them front-running hussies start sniffing around.
C: MASON
D: So what you're saying is, I should take up lacrosse.
C: DAD
D: Exactly. Or you could, you know, start a band. Worked for me a long time ago. I think it's still working for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking pictures.
C: MASON
D: She hated the pictures I took of her.
C: DAD
D: Alright. I'm sick to death of her, okay? I only met her a few times and yes she was cute, alright. But, truth be told I always thought she was a little bit, you know, a little bit too square for you. Y'know, not quite the same vibe.
C: MASON
D: You really thought that?
C: DAD
D: On some subtle, lower level. I mean, uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned out she was interested in some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay? I mean, bottom line is, it's all timing with these things. Y'know. I mean, uh, take your mom and me. Y'know I think I probably turned into the boring castrated guy she wanted me to be fifteen or twenty years ago, y'know? And man I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed. I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know, she could have been a little more patient... a little more forgiving.
C: MASON
D: Would've saved me that parade of drunken assholes.
N: Dad gestures zipping his lip, saying nothing.
C: MASON
D: So what's the point?
E: CONT'D
C: DAD
D: Of what?
C: MASON
D: I don't know, any of this. Everything.
C: DAD
D: Everything? What's the point? I mean I sure as shit don't know. I mean, but, neither does anybody else. Okay, we're all just winging it, you know? I mean the good news is you're feeling stuff. You know? And you got to hold onto that. You do. I mean you get older and you don't feel as much. You're skin gets tougher. The point is those pictures you took. Thousands of submissions from all over the state and you won.
C: MASON
D: Well, I got silver. And nine other people did, too.
C: DAD
D: I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to tell you that I believe in you, Mason. I think you're really special, and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, y'know?
N: Jimmy's at the mic.
C: JIMMY
D: Hey, this next one goes out to a young man in the house --
E: O.S.
C: DAD
D: Woo-oho!
C: JIMMY
D: Known him since he was just a small boy, now he's all graduated from high school, making me feel old. Happy high school graduation, Mason.
N: He plays his guitar, and the band kicks in... sounding pretty great.
S: INT. CAFE - DAY
N: Mom, Mason and Samantha sit down at a table. A waitress places menus.
C: MOM
D: Thank you. Okay guys, let's be clear. I'm going to break this into four categories. One. Anything you wanna keep from your childhood and your taking with you. Two. Throwing away. Three. Donating. Four. Whatever you wanna try to sell at the garage sell next weekend, whatever we don't sell, we're donating.
C: MASON
D: Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something?
C: MOM
D: No. You're missing the point. We're not going to drag a bunch of crap to mom's tiny apartment.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Can't believe we're moving again.
C: MOM
D: No, I'm moving! You moved two years ago. You have an apartment in Austin. Mason is moving the fall. I'm done. This will be great for me. I'll have all these options. I could take a sabbatical. I could get some writing done and try to get published.
C: MASON
D: What about Christmas, though? What are we gonna do?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm not sharing a room with him.
C: MOM
D: One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress.
C: SAMANTHA
D: How am I supposed to do my laundry?
C: MOM
D: Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest.
E: MORE
C: MOM
D: And on your way down you may magically find some quarters that you use to do laundry in your own apartment. Come on! You guys are adults. You need to take some responsibility! And what do you want?
E: CONT'D
N: Mom puts her glasses on.
C: MASON
D: I'm gonna get the veggie burger.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm not having anything, not hungry.
N: Mom takes her glasses off.
C: MOM
D: What's wrong with you?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm sick.
C: MOM
D: What is it, your head? Do you have a fever?
C: MASON
D: She's pregnant.
C: SAMANTHA
D: No. To be honest, I drank way too much last night.
E: weak laugh
C: MOM
D: You weren't driving, were you?
C: SAMANTHA
D: No. No. Carrie's back home, too, and we just hung out. You know, peach Smirnoffs, they just go down so easy.
C: MOM
D: No, no. Hey - that's not an excuse. You can still pack boxes. These people want to move in as soon as possible.
N: The assistant restaurant manager, who'll we'll come to know as ERNESTO, approaches the table.
C: ERNESTO
D: Hi guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you? Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago.
E: to Mom
C: MOM
D: Oh, yeah.
C: ERNESTO
D: Believe it or not, you changed my life. Yeah, you told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school. I took your advice! I signed up for English classes and then a year later I went to community college and I got my associates degree. And I'm working on my bachelors now at Texas State. And I'm also one of the managers here.
C: MOM
D: That's great.
C: ERNESTO
D: Uh, it's good to see you. Because I really wanted a chance to thank you for that. Gracias. It really meant a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can do.
C: MOM
D: Thanks.
C: ERNESTO
D: You guys should listen to her. She's a smart lady.
C: MOM
D: Thank you.
N: Ernesto walks back toward the kitchen, leaving the three seated at the table.
S: EXT. APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Mason, now with a scruffy beard, is wedging a duffel bag and bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's new apartment.
S: INT. APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Mason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is seated in another room.
C: MASON
D: ...Isn't that kind of crazy though, that a computer knows who you are from just twenty questions off a form? I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world.
N: Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug.
C: MASON
D: I mean there are subsets, like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are.
E: CONT'D
C: MOM
D: Have you even talked to this guy yet?
C: MASON
D: No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool. He's studying literature, and uh, anthropology, and he's way into Bright Eyes... so that's not so bad. But anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100%. Just cause of the computer.
C: MOM
D: Well. Sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then.
C: MASON
D: Yeah. But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire. Because they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is, based on everything you've ever said, written, or clicked.
N: Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box. He holds up a framed picture.
C: MASON
D: Did you -- Did you put this in here again?
E: CONT'D
N: Mom laughs.
C: MASON
D: I don't want it.
E: CONT'D
C: MOM
D: Come on, it's the first picture you ever took.
C: MASON
D: Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right?
N: Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom suddenly breaks into quiet sobs. He comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying.
C: MASON
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: MOM
D: Nothing.
E: crying
C: MASON
D: No, what is it?
C: MOM
D: Nothing!
C: MASON
D: Mom...
C: MOM
D: This is the worst day of my life.
C: MASON
D: What are you talking about?
C: MOM
D: I knew this day was coming. I just -- I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving.
C: MASON
D: I mean, it's not that I'm that happy. What do you, what do you expect?
C: MOM
D: You know what I'm realizing? My life is just gonna go, like that! This series of milestones. Getting married, having kids, getting divorced, the time that we thought you were dyslexic, when I taught you how to ride a bike, getting divorced AGAIN, getting my masters degree, finally getting the job I wanted, sending Samantha off to college, sending YOU off the college... You know what's next? Huh? It's my fuckin' funeral!
N: A beat.
C: MOM
D: Just go, and leave my picture!
E: CONT'D
N: Stunned, Mason doesn't know what to say.
C: MASON
D: Aren't you jumping ahead by like, forty years or something?
C: MOM
D: I just thought there would be more.
N: Mom sits at the table crying. Mason does not know how to comfort her.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Mason drives his pick-up truck through the open roads and mountains of West Texas.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
N: Mason stops at a gas station to fill up. While he waits, he takes pictures.
S: EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
N: Mason pulls into the parking lot of his University and parks.
S: INT. DORM - AFTERNOON
N: Mason walks through a hallway area and finds his dorm room. He enters to find it half decorated with music going. He throws his bag up on the available bed and starts to unpack and get situated. DALTON enters.
C: DALTON
D: Hey, you must be Mason.
C: MASON
D: Yeah. Dalton, right?
C: DALTON
D: Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.
C: MASON
D: Definitely.
C: DALTON
D: Are you cool with this side of the room?
C: MASON
D: Yeah.
C: DALTON
D: Got in this morning, just moved my shit in, man.
C: MASON
D: Well, yeah. I don't- I don't care. No worries.
E: laughs
N: He unzips his bag, but keeps the conversation going.
C: DALTON
D: Cool. Can I help with anything, man? Any bags? Any last stuff you need brought in?
C: MASON
D: I just got like one... box left, I packed pretty light. But I appreciate it.
C: DALTON
D: My pleasure, man. Of course.
C: MASON
D: Um, are you goin' to the orientation mixer thing?
C: DALTON
D: Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no, man! I'm not goin' to that and neither are you, by the way. We got way better stuff to be doin', dude.
N: BARB, Dalton's girlfriend, drifts into the room.
C: BARB
D: You ready?
C: DALTON
D: Yeah. Hey, Barb, this' my roommate Mason. Mason, Barb.
N: They shake.
C: MASON
D: Hi.
C: BARB
D: Hey. You comin' with us?
C: MASON
D: Where're you going?
C: BARB
D: Hiking.
C: DALTON
D: Yeah, man, you should come. If we leave now we can catch the late afternoon at Big Bend. You ever been before, man?
C: MASON
D: Yeah. But not since I was really little.
C: DALTON
D: Oh, well then all the more reason to come now, man. That's why we're here, dude.
N: Barb's roommate, NICOLE, is now hanging out by the door.
C: DALTON
D: Oh, Mason. This is Nicole, Barb's roommate.
E: CONT'D
C: NICOLE
D: Hey, what's up?
C: MASON
D: Hi.
N: Barb is reaching in her bag for something.
C: DALTON
D: Mason, Nicole.
C: BARB
D: So, you game?
E: to Mason
C: MASON
D: Sure.
N: She has produced a chunk of brownie that she hands to Mason.
C: BARB
D: Here. Have the rest of this. Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick in when we get to the mountains.
N: Mason takes it, a little amused, looks at the others (confirmation), then starts to consume.
C: MASON
D: Awesome.
C: DALTON
D: Let's go.
E: O.S.
N: They roll out of there.
S: EXT. BIG BEND - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Mason, Nicole, Dalton and Barb hike through a BIG canyon. Nicole talks to Mason about teaching dance.
C: MASON
D: Do they let you major in that here?
C: NICOLE
D: Well, it's not that serious here, so I kinda like train outside the university, but I'm taking all my basics like History of Dance and all that.
C: MASON
D: Nice.
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah.
C: MASON
D: What do you teach?
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop...
C: MASON
D: Wow. Which one's your favorite?
C: NICOLE
D: Tap.
C: MASON
D: Yeah?
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah. You can make up all your own sounds and there's no rules.
C: MASON
D: Right...
C: NICOLE
D: Just, like, creative freedom.
C: MASON
D: That's great.
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah.
C: MASON
D: Right.
C: NICOLE
D: ... So to be a part of bringing it back to the kids...
C: MASON
D: Right, keep it going.
C: NICOLE
D: ... Is really rewarding. Yeah.
C: MASON
D: How old are they?
C: NICOLE
D: Six to eight.
C: MASON
D: Wow.
E: laughs
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah. They have like no fear, and they're not self-conscious at all.
E: laughing
C: MASON
D: They haven't reached the awkward years yet.
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah, not yet. It's coming.
N: The group continues walking over a ridge as the sun is setting.
S: EXT. HIKE - LATER
N: As Barb and Dalton coyote call on the rocks, Mason joins Nicole sitting on a rock overlooking the river and sunset.
C: NICOLE
D: Hey.
N: Dalton and Barb continue like coyotes, much to Nicole and Mason's amusement.
C: NICOLE
D: Dalton can be crazy sometimes.
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: He seems cool, though.
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah. Yeah, they're both really cool. How are you feeling?
N: They both laugh.
C: MASON
D: Great. Really great, to be honest.
C: NICOLE
D: Good. I'm really happy that you're hangin' out with us.
C: MASON
D: Yeah. Me too.
N: Meanwhile, over on a big rock, the coyotes are now yelling words.
C: DALTON
D: This moment's having a multiple orgasm! It's like as if all of time has unfolded before us so we can stand here and look out and scream - Fuck yea!! Wooo!
E: O.S.
N: Back with Nicole and Mason laughing.
C: NICOLE
D: You know how everyone's always saying, "Seize the moment"?
N: Mason nods yes.
C: NICOLE
D: I don't know, I'm kinda thinkin' it's the other way around. You know, like, the moment seizes us.
E: CONT'D
C: MASON
D: Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant, the moments, it's just... it's like always right now, you know?
C: NICOLE
D: Yeah.
N: They trade smiles.
T: FADE OUT
