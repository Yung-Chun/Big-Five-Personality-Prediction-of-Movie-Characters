D: Women and the space program have come a long way, sweetheart. But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
C: ELAINE
D: But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.

S: EXT. REAR OF TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
N: SARG (imagine George Kennedy), dressed in a tuxedo, tie undone, with a huge cigar, which he eats during the conversation, talks to his wife on his car phone. A worker in hard hat waits next to him. Behind the worker are fuel drums and a large sign that reads: DANGER, FUEL -- ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING, ABSOLUTELY NO SPITTING.

N: Sarg lights his cigar.
C: SARG
D: Is there someone else, Marge? Is that it?
N: Sarg throws the lit match towards the "ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING" sign. The worker grimaces but nothing happens.
C: MARGE
D: Sarg, there's been someone else for fifteen years. You were just too involved in your work to see it.
N: They hang up. Sarg bites off the end of his cigar and spits it in the direction of the "NO SPITTING" sign, blowing the worker OUT OF FRAME with a MASSIVE EXPLOSION. Sarg hops into his car, takes a Lava lamp from the seat and puts it on the car roof -- like Kojak's flasher. The lamp flashes, the SIREN WAILS, as Sarg pulls away.
S: INT. SARG'S CAR - ON THE MOVE - NIGHT
N: He thinks about his wife. SPLIT SCREEN FLASHBACK OF THEIR BEDROOM. Marge, a cigar in her mouth, is in bed with five football players -- other half-clad athletes (hockey, baseball, wrestling, basketball) line up for their turn at her. Sarg has to climb over them to kiss her goodbye.
C: SARG

C: ALICE
D: It was just a joke, Jimmy.
N: Alice and John look at each other as if there is something wrong with their son. ANGLE ON MAN WITH CAGE A man lifts a large dog cage out of the trunk of a taxi. Inside is another man dressed in S&M leathers.
C: MAN WITH CAGE
D: If we can't fit you under the seat, you'll just have to be locked up with the luggage.
E: to Man in Cage
N: The man in the cage seems to relish the latter suggestion. Two Porters lift the cage onto a conveyor belt next to Jimmy's dog.
S: EXT. GANTRY - NIGHT
N: Sarg stands beside the burnt panel on the side of the shuttle. He is eating another cigar, holding a burnt wire, and talking into a walkie-talkie.

C: ELAINE
D: Simon, why has he become so... so...
E: crying on Simon's shoulder
C: SIMON
D: So mentally ill?
N: Elaine collapses on Simon's shoulder, sobbing. Simon smiles evilly. The technician with the jumper cables, b.g., signals the driver to start the car. The car revs and the rocket fires.

C: TED
D: Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.
C: STELLA
D: You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
C: TED
D: Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
C: STELLA
D: Yes. He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried on Mercury.

D: Elaine, what happened to us?
C: ELAINE
D: Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon. He's stable. He's a good provider. I want that at this stage of the game, Ted. He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.

D: His name's David Stockman. He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
C: ELAINE
D: Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick. Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time. And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
N: Ted gags on his spaghetti.
C: ELAINE
D: I just can't go on living with a man who refuses to deal with reality, Ted. I have to go now. Believe me, it's best for all concerned.
N: Elaine leans over to kiss Ted. He turns away.

D: That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.

C: FRANK
D: Carol's not going to give me a divorce that easily, Jane.
C: JANE
D: I'm worried about her, Frank. She could do something senseless, something violent.

C: DETECTIVE HALLICK
D: Senseless or not, Sergeant, there's a pattern here. This is the 12th victim this week with a chalk mark around the body. I want this whole area cordoned off! I want everyone in this terminal booked and beaten until they talk. I want an M.O. on everyone who has seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC and I want the entire population of Hawaii off that rock and into the water within one hour.
N: Hallick stands up and finds the area surrounded by 30 accordian players playing "Lady of Spain."
C: DETECTIVE HALLICK

E: holding a finger to his lips
C: JOE
D: I don't want to hear that word!

E: Scottish accent
S: INT. TERMINAL CORRIDOR
N: Joe Salucci snaps his attache case closed. Wipes the sweat from his brow. Takes out a "Des Moines" ticket and throws it away. Looks at another ticket -- "Mercury." Takes a last drag from his cigarette, throws it on the ground and hurries off. The cigarette rolls under the "STORAGE ROOM" door.
S: INT. STORAGE ROOM
N: Ted, tied in chair, watches the cigarette roll up to some oil rags. They burst into flame. The flames lap up against a yellow oil drum labeled "EXPLOSIVE." PAN to three more drums labeled, "DYNAMIC!", "BRILLIANT!", "A MUST SEE!".

CONTROLLER 1 Yes, sir. McCROSKY And a gallon of milk of magnesia, and a ham on rye, no cheese! CONTROLLER 1 Yes, sir! Welcome home, sir! McCrosky takes off his raincoat revealing scuba tank. He takes off his tank as well. CONTROLLER 2 (approaching McCrosky) Here are the navigational charts, sir. McCROSKY Thanks. Another Controller passes. McCrosky stops him. McCROSKY Get me a readout on their fuel capacity. CONTROLLER 3 Yes, sir. CONTROLLER 4 Here's all the available information on the sun. That thing's hot, sir. McCrosky takes the info and burns his hand. SFX: STEAM McCROSKY Ahhhhhh! Get me Bud Kruger immediately! (spotting Jacobs) Jacobs, I want to know absolutely everything that's happened up till now!
C: JACOBS
D: First the earth cooled. Then the dinosaurs came but were too big and died and everything got rotten and turned into oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs and then there was the best TV special on Judy Garland. Then we lost the war with Albania. Then...
N: McCrosky leaves Jacobs babbling. McCROSKY Things sure haven't changed. McCrosky stands in front of a huge painting of himself. Both he and painting are in the same pose -- one hand loosens the tie, he drinks coffee with the other, a cigarette dangles from his lip.

N: The group prod Elaine to try the bull. A cowboy hat flies across the room. She grabs it, pulls it on, and moves to the bull which is surrounded by others in cowboy hats. Elaine hops in the saddle. A sinister character puts a quarter in and madly flips knobs. SFX: VIDEO GAME The saddle doesn't move -- all the action is on the screen but Elaine throws one hand back and kicks her legs.
