N: A TITLE SEQUENCE Still photos of twenty-four principal actors. 1 CLOSE SHOT - SIGN Nashville Airport.
S: 2 EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY
N: TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.
S: 3 INT. AIRPORT - DAY
N: NORMAN is attracted to large CONNIE WHITE display.
S: 4 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
N: At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the jukebox we hear one of her songs. The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN. There are several people at the counter with him, including GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them. A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full or dishes. This is WADE.
C: WADE
D: You want a ride into town?
E: to SUELEEN
C: SUELEEN
D: You bet.
N: REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his newspaper.
C: SUELEEN
D: Got me an audition tonight.
C: WADE
D: Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
N: She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking looks at her.
C: SUELEEN
D: I've just been waiting for the right spot to sing in... I'm so nervous...
N: She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.
C: SUELEEN
D: I'm good, though. There ain't but one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to be conceited, but really it's true. I've been taking special coaching lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's just wonderful. Teaches you how to phrase; that's really important. And breathing. Well, you know all about that. Anyway, I wrote this song.
N: She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished his meal.
C: SUELEEN
D: Oh, listen, I really do go on. Here's your check. Sure has been nice talking to you.
N: As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the jukebox, "Keep on a goin'." The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.
T: CUT TO:
S: 5 INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY
N: We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN, who is recording. He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. HAVEN is not too happy with him. 6 ANOTHER ANGLE OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.
S: 7 INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.
C: BUD
D: Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and gets upset.
N: She looks at him.
C: BUD
D: He's my father.
C: OPAL
D: Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
S: 8 INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY
N: They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. OPAL asks BUD who this group is.
S: 9 INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY
N: BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and starts to leave, yelling at the producer.
C: HAVEN
D: Who the hell is playing piano? Get that hippie out of here... He's got a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to the airport. When you get my backups straight, then we'll talk about cutting this tune here.
N: He heads for the hallway.
S: 10 INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white knight. OPAL moves near.
C: OPAL
D: Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting together a film. I would like to ask some questions.
N: She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.
C: HAVEN
D: Foreigner?
C: OPAL
D: I'm from BBC television.
C: HAVEN
D: Where the hell is that?
N: HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and PEARL. He spots LINNEA.
C: HAVEN
D: Linnea.
C: LINNEA
D: How you doing, Haven?
C: HAVEN
D: oh, fine. Couldn't be better.
N: 11 ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep
T: CUT TO:
S: 12 EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
N: Barbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt.
S: 13 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

T: CUT TO:
S: 15 EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY
N: GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps close to NORMAN.
C: GLENN
D: Am I late?
C: NORMAN
D: Late! Oh, Jesus!
N: He runs off. 16 ANOTHER ANGLE As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all shake hands.
C: HAVEN
D: Delbert, how are you?
C: REESE
D: I'm fine. This here is John Triplette. Triplette, like you to meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven Hamilton.
C: HAVEN
D: Good to meet you. Bud, have them move the horses.
E: turns to BUD
C: TRIPLETTE
D: Pleasure
C: REESE
D: Where is she?
C: HAVEN
D: Still inside the plane posing for pictures and signing autographs. She's got a new album cut again. She'll be down in a minute. But she'll be late for the Opera if she doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on the walkie-talkie.
N: BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get anything.
C: BUD
D: They don't seem to be answering. The ambulance boys are here, though. Barnett always expects them to get there like a shot. That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going.
C: HAVEN
D: Thank you, Bud.
N: BUD nods like he has been complimented. 17 ANGLE TOWARD PLANE A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in awe of the situation. When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN descends the stairs.
C: HAVEN
D: Bud, tell them to move the horses. Promised this strip would be spic and span.
N: He smiles and winks.
C: REESE
D: Listen, we'll go get the car and come back. This'l1 be going on for a while.
C: HAVEN
D: You bet. She's probably talking to somebody about their sick child. You know how she is.
N: They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville. 18 ANOTHER ANGLE BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.
S: 19 EXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY
N: While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, trying to pretend he's on time.
C: NORMAN
D: Hi.
N: BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.
C: BILL
D: Hi, Norman.
N: NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.
C: NORMAN
D: Sure is nice to see you all again. I never thought I'd see you again after the last time.
C: BILL
D: Oh, Norman, you worry too much.
N: MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.
C: MARY
D: Norman, how are you?
N: She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to someone else.
C: NORMAN
D: Fine. Just fine.
N: As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking toward it, shaking hands with several people.
C: NORMAN
D: Sure have missed you all, though. Oh, where's Tom? Isn't he with you?
C: BILL
D: Don't worry about old Tom.
N: 20 ANOTHER ANGLE TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof. Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape- recorded VOICE:
C: VOICE
D: Have you thought about your future and what America needs to examine...
N: Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.
S: 21 EXT. PARKING LOT
N: NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also joins the procession. 22 ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and there seems to be a great deal at activity. REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way. 23 NEW ANGLE Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. They test her reflexes, etc..
C: ATTENDANT
D: How long was she out?
C: BARNETT
D: Not too long. But she keeps passing out.
N: She comes to and looks at them all.
C: BARBARA JEAN
D: Just give your manna that vitamin E. Makes a world of difference.
E: oblivious
C: HAVEN
D: Here she is again.
N: She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Okay, let's get her to the wagon.
N: A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance speeds off, siren wailing.

N: L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes.
C: L.A. JOAN

C: GREEN

E: hasn't heard
C: L.A. JOAN
D: All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
C: GREEN
D: Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
N: He chuckles at his prepared joke.
C: L.A. JOAN

C: GREEN
D: What did you say?
C: L.A. JOAN
D: I said, maybe I'll change my name again.

D: We had these two city boys come in last week. One or them said his Ford truck had cut off his foot. The other one said that wasn't true. Then the first said he looked just like Eddie Black when he said that...
C: HAVEN
D: Bud, would you be sure to get the oil changed?
C: BUD
D: Ya... where do you want me to take it?
C: PEARL
D: Do you remember Eddie Black? He had those blue eyes.
C: HAVEN
D: Where you always take it. There's nothing special about this time.
C: PEARL
D: And they started pounding on each other. But the one without the foot was strongest.
C: HAVEN
D: Bud, you're going to have to show up at the hospital tar me I gotta get back to that session.
C: BUD
D: Okay. Anything you want me to say?
C: HAVEN
D: Say I had to get back to the session. ~ God -- All school did for you, you can put in a thimble.

N: SUELEEN in doing some vocal exercising. WADE listens for awhile.
C: WADE
D: Is that what you're going to sing?
N: She laughs.
C: SUELEEN
D: No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
C: WADE
D: You think I got any kind of a voice?
N: He breaks into a scale.
C: SUELEEN
D: You sure do it loud.
C: WADE
D: Is that good?
C: SUELEEN
D: It's not bad.
C: WADE
D: You think I should take lessons?

They'll applaud like crazy 'cause I can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing. It really doesn't make much difference, really. But since you've never done this before, singing might help.
N: They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the oven.
C: TRIPLETTE
