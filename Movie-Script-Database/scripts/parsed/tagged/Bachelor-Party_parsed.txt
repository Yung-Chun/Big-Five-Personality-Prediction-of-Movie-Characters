T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY
N: CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both firmly by the shoulders.
C: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: Make one more move and you'll both be staying late for the rest of the week.
C: THE BOYS
D: Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
E: softly; in unison
C: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: I didn't hear you.
C: THE BOYS
D: Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
E: louder
N: Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate. Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking place around the corner.
C: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: Step away from the curb, children.
E: used to this
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on. While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life... This incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps up to him.
C: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: You're late again, Rick.
C: RICK
D: I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
C: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: There can be no excuse for tardiness.
C: RICK
D: You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
N: He starts sobbing softly into his hands.
C: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: All right, stop that... Children, on the bus.
N: The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is drying his tears with his handkerchief.
C: RICK
D: Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
C: SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
E: smiling despite herself
C: RICK
D: Right... Think it over.
N: He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus out of the parking lot.
S: INT. BUS - DAY
N: As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top of their lungs. ANGLE - RICK He removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order.
C: RICK
D: If you don't all calm down I'm gonna drive this thing over a cliff.
E: over mike
N: The kids pay no attention to him.
C: RICK
D: Ah... youth.
E: continuing; philosophically
S: EXT. THE BUS
N: Rick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his engine. Rick counters by gunning his.
S: INT. THE BUS
N: All the kids start screaming "Race... race." "Wipe 'em out." "Go for it." Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out money and start betting one another on the race's outcome. ANGLE - RICK as he readies for action.
S: EXT. THE BUSES
N: The light turns green and they're off. Or as off as two lunky school buses filled with kids can be. WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET The two buses come zooming down the street.
S: INT. RICK'S BUS
N: The kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him.
S: EXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLE
N: The buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with one another.
S: INT. THE BUS
N: The kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to control the inevitable.
S: EXT. THE BUSES
N: They race down a steep hill.
S: INT. THE BUS
N: The nauseous kid can't hold it any longer.
S: EXT. THE OTHER BUS
N: Something hits with a splat against the windshield that resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup.
S: INT. THE OTHER BUS
N: The other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it worse.
S: EXT. THE STREET
N: Rick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time.
S: INT. RICK'S BUS
N: Rick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage a victorious cheer. PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV We're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one- year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.
C: O'NEILL
D: Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... and watch the birdie.
E: O.S.
N: He takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash.
C: O'NEILL
D: There.
E: O.S.
N: O'NEILL We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering up her baby.
C: O'NEILL
D: These should be in the mail to you by next Friday.
N: She smiles and exits.
C: O'NEILL
D: Next.
E: continuing
N: A beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters. Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes settle onto her full breasts. These he likes.
C: O'NEILL
D: Whoa. Look at those babies.
E: continuing
N: She gets this innuendo and loves it.
C: O'NEILL
D: How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
E: continuing
C: WOMAN
D: Klupner. Mrs. Klupner.
E: teasing
C: O'NEILL
D: Mrs.?
C: WOMAN
D: I'm separated.
C: O'NEILL
D: Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
N: He takes the baby. He has a hard time taking his eyes off her breasts. He places the baby on the blanket.
C: O'NEILL
D: If I were you, I'd breast feed until I was 17 or 18. Tell ya what...
E: continuing gets behind camera; sizing up the shot
N: O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH CAMERA We SEE the baby sitting on the blanket.
C: O'NEILL
D: Why don't you lean into the picture with your child?
E: O.S.
N: She coyly leans INTO FRAME.
C: O'NEILL
D: A-huh. A little more... good!
E: O.S. continuing
N: She is totally blocking her baby out of the picture. O'NEILL He gets out from behind the camera.
C: O'NEILL
D: I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
C: WOMAN
D: Of course.
E: seductively
N: She starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his camera. O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENS We SEE the Woman finish her last button.
C: O'NEILL
D: Now lean in a little more... more... more...
E: O.S.
N: As she complies, her breasts all but spill out of her dress.
C: O'NEILL
D: Hold that pose.
E: O.S. continuing
N: O'NEILL He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman. THROUGH CAMERA LENS We SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes. Each pose finds him near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to breast. Etc. RICK enters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps into the shots. THROUGH CAMERA LENS Rick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman gets bored and EXITS the FRAME. THE WOMAN As Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few beats pass and the guys notice they're alone.
C: O'NEILL
D: Where'd she go?
C: RICK
D: She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
N: O'Neill crosses to his camera and takes out the film.
C: O'NEILL
D: Okay... be right with ya.
N: RICK He picks up some photographs of today's work. INSERT - PHOTOS Each one has a different mother in several seductive poses. Their babies are barely visible, if at all.
C: RICK
D: Pictures a family will cherish forever.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. CHULO'S AUTO SHOP - DAY
N: Rick's school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop. Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill hop out.
C: RICK
D: Hey, Chulo, where are you, man?
N: ANGLE - LATE-MODEL CAR We SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic of Mexican ancestry.
C: CHULO
D: Hey, you guys, what's going on?
C: RICK
D: We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
C: CHULO
D: Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
N: A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot.
C: CHULO
D: Roberto, you finished fixing that lighter yet?
E: continuing
N: Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right into traffic.
C: CHULO
D: I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
E: continuing; to Rick
C: O'NEILL
D: Rick's got an important announcement to make.
C: CHULO
D: Yeah. What is it?
C: RICK
D: I've decided not to run for President.
C: CHULO
D: Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
N: Behind them we can SEE Roberto fiddling with the lighter. Suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing Roberto ten feet into the air. ANGLE The guys all start to pile into the bus. Nearby another employee is washing down the garage with a hose. Chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the hood of a car.
C: CHULO
D: Manuel, be sure and finish up the electrical system on that Chevy.
N: Manuel waves at Chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. Rick starts it up and starts to drive away. Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME, we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree, screaming in pain. There is a beat, and then Robert falls INTO FRAME, still holding the cigarette lighter, and the car Raul is driving enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.
S: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
N: A sign on an office door says "CONCERT TICKET AGENCY." From inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone. Chulo, Rick and O'Neill open the door and go inside. On the walls in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters advertising rock bands like Men At Work, The Clash and Barry Manilow. Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses. This is GARY MELNITZ, wheeler-dealer, entrepreneur and coward. Gary yells a lot, which is a definite overcompensation for his size and inability to deal with the opposite sex.
C: GARY
D: Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting. Hi, guys.
E: yelling; into phone hangs up and sees the guys standing there
C: RICK
D: Gary, you're quite an animal.
C: GARY
D: Screw you...
N: The PHONE RINGS.
C: GARY
D: Hello, Concert tickets... What? Pat Benitar has a yeast infection? She's cancelling? Screw her. You know what this is gonna cost me?... Okay. Let's go.
E: continuing; into phone he hangs up
N: He gets up and they start for the door. Just then the PHONE RINGS. Gary picks it up.
C: GARY
D: Screw you... That's crap... Suck my... Oh, Mom, I didn't know it was you... eggs and milk... Okay, I won't forget.
E: annoyed softly
N: He hangs up the phone and they start for the door again.
C: GARY
D: Let's go.
C: RICK
D: Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
C: CHULO
D: Yeah, he's really got his thing together.
C: GARY
D: Oh, eat me!
N: The guys all laugh and exit.
S: INT. HARBORSIDE INN - DAY
N: It's a quiet restaurant near a Marina. A lot of business- people in suits are eating. TWO MALE CUSTOMERS CUSTOMER ONE calls for a waiter.
C: CUSTOMER ONE
D: Waiter.
N: The WAITER approaches them from OUT OF FRAME.
C: CUSTOMER ONE
D: We'd like to order now.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE We see their waiter, RYKO, a blond, tanned, muscular beach bum who has definitely stayed out in the sun too long.
C: RYKO
D: How you guys doin'... Could you believe how overcast it was this morning? Bad day for sailin', waves are too rough and...
C: CUSTOMER
D: You can skip the small craft warnings. We're in a hurry.
E: annoyed

C: RYKO
D: We got... uh, veal... ah... veal... What's this word?
E: to customer
C: CUSTOMER ONE
D: Parmisan.
C: RYKO
D: Yeah right. I always want to say Paramisian when I see that. We looked at them under the jigamabob in biology once. Little squirmy, creepy things that live in your intestine and...
C: CUSTOMER
D: Please... We have an appointment in a half hour...
C: RYKO
D: Wow, sounds stressful. What do you guys do for a living?
C: CUSTOMER ONE
D: We're lawyers.
C: RYKO
D: Whoa... You got to go to school for that or what?
C: CUSTOMER
D: Look, forget the specials. We'll take three hamburgers.
E: he's had enough
C: RYKO
D: Okay, great... Any of you guys got a pencil by any chance?
N: One of the customers shrugs and hands him a pen.
C: RYKO
D: All right, a Bic... How 'bout a piece of paper?
E: impressed
N: Ryko's customers look totally disgusted as Ryko's short attention span is interrupted by something he sees O.S. ANOTHER ANGLE Rick and the guys appear in the bar.
C: RICK
D: Ryko. Come on!
N: They all disappear into the bar area.
C: RYKO
D: Be right there. Nice rappin' with you guys. Unfortunately I'm outta here. Someone else will have to help you. Skip!
E: to customers calling off
N: The customers are pleased to get rid of Ryko. SKIP enters. He's a clone of Ryko.
C: SKIP
D: Like um... What's the deal, you guys gonna order?
N: The customers give each other a "Here we go again" look ANGLE - THE GUYS They're laughing uproariously and carrying on as Ryko comes over and sits down.
C: RYKO
D: Hi pals.
N: The guys acknowledge him.
C: GARY
D: Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
N: ANGLE - RICK
C: RICK
D: All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
C: CHULO
D: Man, you're losing your audience.
C: RICK
D: Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
C: O'NEILL
D: What?
C: CHULO
D: You're kidding.
C: GARY
D: I don't believe it.
C: RYKO
D: Fuck me!
C: RICK
D: Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
C: CHULO
D: Hey, man, congratulations!
N: Chulo gets up and gives Rick a big bear hug... The other guys shake his hand.
C: GARY
D: Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
C: RICK
D: Because I love her. What can I tell you?
C: RYKO
D: You sure? This means no more partying.
C: RICK
D: No more raping and pillaging, either. You'll have to carry on without me.
C: GARY
D: Next Saturday... That's just two more weeks to live.
C: O'NEILL
D: Hold it... As long as you're gonna go through with this, the least we can do is make sure you go out in style.
C: CHULO
D: Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
E: warming to this
C: O'NEILL
D: Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
C: RICK
D: Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
C: GARY
D: Let's have a toast.
N: The guys all raise their glasses.
C: O'NEILL
D: To Rick.
C: GARY
D: To us.
C: CHULO
D: To girls with big pairs.
C: ALL THE GUYS
D: Yeah, right on, etc.
N: As they down their drinks, we:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
N: We SEE a couple of very contemporary looking 15-year-olds going into a very "now" clothing store -- like Fred Segal's... When the door opens, loud ROCK 'N ROLL MUSIC blasts out.
S: INT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
N: Inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving narcissistically to the music like they're at a disco. The cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current trends and fads no matter how inane they may be. Today she's in a reggae mode, her hair wound into tight dreadlocks, as she sways lost in the ozone to the music. A CUSTOMER approaches her with a purchase.
C: CUSTOMER
D: I'd like to pay for these.
C: PHOEBE
D: Huh... What... Oh sure, wait till this song is over.
N: She floats off again... One of the young MALE CUSTOMERS approaches an attractive salesgirl. This is DEBBIE THOMERSON, Rick's intended. She seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's actually working, putting clothes on the racks. This impression of sanity fits her, as she is level-headed, and has a clear sense of herself. She can also take a joke, thus her engagement to Rick.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Excuse me, where can I try on these pants?
C: DEBBIE
D: Right over here.
N: She leads the Customer to the try-on booths. The Customer enters one. We SEE that the saloon-style doors of the booths have been hung too high, so as he takes off his pants, his underwear is exposed to the world. We PULL BACK, REVEALING other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in sight. No one in the store seems to care, however, as they are much too busy dancing. The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy- looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. She is O'Neill's girl and Debbie's best friend... She's also someone who would party every night if given half a chance.
C: BOBBIE
D: Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
E: excited
C: DEBBIE
D: Bobbie, what are you talking about?
C: BOBBIE
D: O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
N: Phoebe crosses to them.
C: PHOEBE
D: What's happening?
C: BOBBIE
D: Debbie's marrying Rick.
C: PHOEBE
D: ...Really?
C: DEBBIE
D: Yes, it's true.
C: PHOEBE
D: Ohmygod.
N: The girls screech and jump around, hugging each other in sheer joy. A MALE CUSTOMER, moved by this outpouring of affection, moves over and gets in the middle of the girls, enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once.
C: DEBBIE
D: Would you get out of here.
E: to Customer; realizing
N: Reluctantly the guy retreats back to the Calvin Klein jeans rack.
C: BOBBIE
D: Does Cole know about this?
C: PHOEBE
D: Really -- you went with him for two years.
C: DEBBIE
D: He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
C: BOBBIE
D: He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
C: DEBBIE
D: No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
C: PHOEBE
D: I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
E: oblivious
C: BOBBIE
D: Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
C: DEBBIE
D: Oh, that's really sweet. I'd love that.
C: PHOEBE
D: We'll invite all the girls.
C: BOBBIE
D: I don't believe it... Mrs. Rick Stahl.
N: The girls all start to scream and carry on all over again.
S: INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen / living room. He has about five dishes going at once as he dashes from stove to refrigerator. He grabs some hamburger meat, rolls it into a ball, then slaps it on the counter. He then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty. Debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs him tightly, kissing him sweetly.
C: DEBBIE
D: God, you're a slob.
E: between kisses
C: RICK
D: But a fabulous cook.
C: DEBBIE
D: What are we having?
C: RICK
D: It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
C: DEBBIE
D: I think your dinner's burning.
E: looking at the stove
N: Rick crosses to the stove. A small fire is coming out of one of the frying pans. He douses it with water.
C: RICK
D: Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
C: DEBBIE
D: Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
E: setting the table
C: RICK
D: Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
C: DEBBIE
D: You're going to have a bachelor party?
C: RICK
D: Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think?
E: he brings all the food to the table
C: DEBBIE
D: It looks awful.
C: RICK
D: Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however.
E: takes a bite
C: DEBBIE
D: Are you going to have women at your party?
C: RICK
D: No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
C: RICK
D: Oh, those. Why do you ask?
C: DEBBIE
D: Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
N: Rick grabs her; starts kissing her passionately on the neck.
C: RICK
D: Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo man. No painted lady ever gonna come between us.
C: DEB
D: I need you to promise.
C: RICK
D: Okay, you got it. I got a way we can seal the deal -- what'd you say?
N: He grabs her. They kiss and slide down onto the table, knocking the dishes to the floor.
S: EXT. BEL AIR-TYPE ESTATE - DAY
N: Through the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit. She pulls up behind a new Porsche 911 and a Jeep, all decked out with rifles, nets and other hunting equipment. As she walks down the path toward the house, she sees something off in the distance that startles her. DEBBIE'S POV A large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side door of the house. ANGLE - DEBBIE
C: DEBBIE
D: Cole?... Cole!
E: calling O.S.
N: DEBBIE'S POV The "Bear" turns around. We SEE that the bear is, in fact, dead. It is being carried by a tall, handsome HUNTER. He waves to Debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside.
S: INT. COLE'S SMOKEHOUSE - DAY
N: Debbie opens a rustic-looking door and peers in.
C: DEBBIE
D: Cole?
C: COLE
D: Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
E: O.S.
N: CAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room. She passes several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from the wall. She makes her way past some sections of an undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended from the ceiling. Finally we see COLE WHITTIER, a Steve Garvey look-alike... rugged all-American, and heir to the Whittier Plastic Wrap fortune. Despite his jockish good looks and outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is definitely unsavory. As Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of him. (NOTE: For the squeamish, all of this is done OUT OF FRAME. The only thing we should HEAR are the delightful SOUNDS of TAXIDERMY.)
C: COLE
D: Hi, Deb. Just got back from the mountains. Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna look great in the den.
E: as he cuts in with a surgeon's skill
N: Debbie tries her best not to look down at what he's doing.
C: DEBBIE
D: Cole, we've got to talk.
C: COLE
D: Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
C: DEBBIE
D: No, Cole, I...
C: COLE
D: It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
E: lifting an organ of some sort O.S.
C: DEBBIE
D: Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
C: COLE
D: You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
C: DEBBIE
D: Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
C: COLE
D: You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
E: confused
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
N: Cole stops what he is doing for a beat and just stares at Debbie intensely. Then he returns to his work with a renewed enthusiasm, chopping, slashing and slicing.
C: COLE
D: You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel? Angry, Deb. Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb. No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
E: softly a little louder a little nuts
C: DEBBIE
D: Cole, I'm sorry, I...
C: COLE
D: That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm going now, Cole.
E: uncomfortable
C: COLE
D: I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
N: Debbie exits and we PUSH IN ON Cole. Something on his face says, "Hi! I'm really out of my mind."
S: INT. DR. STAN STAHL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: DR. STAN is Rick's older brother and a proctologist. Although he's only in his early thirties, he thinks and acts like someone in their early 70's. A little on the pompous side, Stan is never without his pipe.
C: STAN
D: Okay, Rick, hold out your arm.
N: He crosses to a sterile container and takes out a syringe.
C: RICK
D: You wouldn't hurt your own brother, would you? I changed my mind. I don't need a blood test. The marriage is off. I --
E: looking at the needle cautiously
N: Just then, Stan sticks the needle in his arm.
C: RICK
D: You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
E: continuing
C: STAN
D: Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
C: RICK
D: True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
C: STAN
D: You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
E: without much conviction
C: RICK
D: Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
N: Stan removes the needle and hands Rick a cotton ball.
C: RICK
D: That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
E: continuing
C: STAN
D: Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
E: returning to this world
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they go out into the hall.
C: STAN
D: Don't say anything to my wife about it.
E: continuing
N: They pass an open examining room. Stan's wife, TINA, is also a doctor and is examining an old man. She's not as tiny as her name suggests. In face, she's more like over-sized.
C: RICK
D: Hi, Tina.
N: Rick moves to hug her and he notices that Tina has her finger up the old guy's ass.
C: TINA
D: Rick... Mr. Goldsmith, this is my brother-in- law. He's getting married.
E: looking up to PATIENT
C: PATIENT
D: Congratulations.
E: without turning around
N: Tina turns to a NURSE.
C: TINA
D: Nurse, will you take over?
N: The nurse shrugs and sticks her finger up the patient's rear end as Tina hugs Rick.
C: TINA
D: I'm so happy for you.
E: continuing
N: Rick hugs her, uneasily trying to make sure her right hand doesn't come anywhere near his face.
S: EXT. DEBBIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
N: Debbie and Rick and her MOM and DAD are having a frustrating game of tennis behind her parents' plush home. Mr. Thomerson is a stockily-built guy in his fifties who prides himself on being tough and competitive. His wife loves to shop. As far as she's concerned, appearances are everything. Neither of them likes Rick's appearance or anything else about their future son-in-law. Mr. Thomerson slams the ball to Rick; Rick slams the ball back and drives it over the fence, out of the court.
C: RICK
D: Oops!
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: All right, who serves?
E: frustrated
C: DEBBIE
D: You do, Daddy.
N: Mr. Thomerson serves the ball to Debbie, who hits it over the net to her mother, who hits it to Rick, who slams it over the fence, out of the court. Mr. Thomerson does not look pleased.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
C: RICK
D: Can't I just maim it a little?
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: No. Let's at least finish the set.
N: Rick starts humming the "ABC Wide World of Sports" theme loudly. Mr. T. gives him a disgusted look and serves the ball. Rick smashes the ball and sends it over the fence, out of the court.
S: EXT. THE THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' BACKYARD - DAY
N: A middle-aged COUPLE are sitting on some lawn furniture trying to read the newspaper. A tennis ball comes down from the sky and hits the guy squarely on the top of the head. PULL OUT to REVEAL that they're surrounded by dozens of tennis balls.
C: MAN
D: One of these days I'm gonna burn Thomerson's court to the ground.
S: EXT. THE THOMERSON'S - MEDIUM SHOT - DAY
N: Rick and Mr. Thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over some lemonade in front of the tennis court.
C: RICK
D: Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
C: RICK
D: I'd love that.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
E: sitting on his anger
C: RICK
D: Mr. Thomerson, I...
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
C: RICK
D: Feel free.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
N: As Mr. Thomerson drones on, Rick shifts uncomfortably in his chair, focusing his attention on Debbie, her mother and her older, cynical cousin, ILENE, who are sitting nearby on the rear patio. ANGLE - DEBBIE, MRS. THOMERSON AND ILENE
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
C: DEBBIE
D: Great, Mom.
C: ILENE
D: If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
C: DEBBIE
D: Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
C: ILENE
D: Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
C: DEBBIE
D: Ilene, Rick promised...
C: ILENE
D: Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
E: trying to change the subject calling to Mr. T
N: ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON AND RICK
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
E: to Rick
C: RICK
D: Well, sir, that's quite a list. But you're absolutely right. And if I work hard at it, I think I can be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch...
N: Mr. Thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his breath. He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. They get up at the same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over Mr. T., and the lemons bounding over the fence.
S: EXT. THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' HOUSE
N: The Neighbor we saw before is reading his paper when an avalanche of lemons comes flying at him, joining the tennis balls on the lawn.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: I hate those people... I really do.
S: INT. THOMERSON HOUSE - DAY
N: The Thomersons, Rick, Debbie and Ilene are just finishing lunch. The DOORBELL RINGS. Mr. Thomerson gets up to answer it. Standing there is Cole, wearing his tennis shorts.
C: COLE
D: Hi, everybody. Am I late?
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
N: Cole crosses to the table and kisses Mrs. T's hand gallantly.
C: COLE
D: Good to see you, Mrs. Thomerson. Hello, Debbie.
N: He turns to Rick.
C: COLE
D: And...
E: continuing
C: RICK
D: Bond... James Bond.
N: Cole gives him a quick look of contempt and exits with Mr. T.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
E: O.S.
C: COLE
D: Sure have...
E: O.S.
C: DEBBIE
D: Why is Cole here?
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: You know your father enjoys his company.
C: RICK
D: Much the way Hitler enjoyed hanging out with Mussolini.
S: EXT. THOMERSON TENNIS COURT - DAY
N: Mr. T. and Cole are having a fast-paced game.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Nice shot.
C: COLE
D: Thank you, sir.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
C: COLE
D: Yes, sir, I am.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
C: COLE
D: I've tried to change her mind.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
C: COLE
D: But how can I do that?
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action.
E: with malice
N: Mr. T. drills a wicked forehand shot straight at Cole, who swings at it and misses.
C: COLE
D: Thanks for the advise, sir.
E: conspiratorily
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Keep me informed.
N: PUSH IN ON Cole. This is a man with a plan...
S: EXT. PARK ON A BLUFF - DAY
N: The bluff overlooks the ocean. It's a beautiful spot. Just the right setting for an outdoor wedding. Some folding chairs have been set up and a canvas canopy. Gathered for the rehearsal are Gary, Ryko, Chulo, O'Neill who is with Bobbie, Debbie's mother and Mr. Thomerson, Phoebe, Ilene, Tina, Stan, a gray-haired priest. FATHER FALWELL and, of course, Rick and Debbie. Everyone is admiring this picturesque setting. Everyone but Mr. Thomerson. He's very underjoyed at the sight of Rick and his friends. Mr. and Mrs. Thomerson are standing with Father Falwell. They are watching Rick holding Debbie.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: You can tell a man by his friends.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: They're not such a bad bunch.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: No? That's his best man peeing on a tree.
E: he points off
N: ANOTHER ANGLE In the b.g. we SEE O'Neill's back TO US. He is definitely relieving himself on a weeping willow. The wind begins to pick up.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: If everyone would take their positions...
N: Everyone takes their places for the wedding procession. The wind now takes this time to blow with much greater force. As Father Falwell opens his Bible, the wind rips the pages out of the Holy Book. They blow to the four corners of the Earth.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: Oh, dear. Well, let's begin. And...
E: continuing
N: He hums the Wedding March. Chulo hums along. His humming is a driving Jimi Hendrix-like guitar lick that all but drowns out Father's humming. FATHER FALWELL He's orchestrating the proceedings.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: Flower Girls... Now Rick... Good... Debbie and Mr. Thomerson.
E: he gestures for him to start down the aisle
N: As he gestures for them to make their walk to him, a gust of wind lifts up Father's cassock, exposing his bare ass. He quickly grabs his cassock and covers himself. RICK He begins to walk toward the priest. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Cole appears at his side.
C: RICK
D: Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
C: COLE
D: I want Debbie.
C: RICK
D: Cole...
C: COLE
D: You dump her and I'll give you cash.
C: RICK
D: What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
C: COLE
D: Five thousand dollars.
C: RICK
D: No.
N: They are now standing near Father Falwell. Debbie is approaching them with Mr. Thomerson. Mr. T. shoots Cole a signal to up the ante.
C: COLE
D: Seventy-five hundred.
C: RICK
D: Not interested.
C: COLE
D: Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
C: RICK
D: I'm marrying Debbie.
C: COLE
D: Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
C: RICK
D: What is this person's story here?
E: to O'Neill
C: O'NEILL
D: The way I see it, the big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances lying around.
N: Debbie and Mr. T. have joined Rick.
C: DEBBIE
D: Cole, what are you doing here?
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: He's just trying to save you from making a mistake. A big mistake.
E: to Rick
C: RICK
D: Thanks, Dad. Cole, go away.
E: to Cole
C: COLE
D: He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
C: RICK
D: Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
N: Cole turns red with anger.
C: COLE
D: Rick, me and you aren't through yet.
E: pissed
N: He runs off.
C: RICK
D: Ladies and gentlemen, Cole Whittier. Let's hear it for him -- a funny, funny guy. We love ya, babe.
E: a la talk show host
N: The wind suddenly picks up. A storm is coming in off the sea. Father Falwell's cassock blows up again. It starts to rain and hail. Everyone runs for cover but Rick and O'Neill.
C: RICK
D: You think the gods are telling me something?
E: to O'Neill
S: INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Rick is snuggled cozily on his side of the bed, fast asleep. Debbie is staring anxiously at the ceiling. After a couple of beats, she tugs at Rick's shoulder.
C: RICK
D: Huh? Wha...
E: drowsy
C: DEBBIE
D: I can't sleep.
C: RICK
D: Oh... I got something for that.
N: He groggily reaches into the nightstand, pulls out a hammer. He raises it as if to hit Debbie over the head.
C: DEBBIE
D: Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
C: RICK
D: What's the matter?
C: DEBBIE
D: I don't know... I just feel scared.

C: DEBBIE
D: Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?

D: That feels so great.
C: RICK
D: Good...
C: DEBBIE
D: Um... that's very relaxing.
C: RICK
D: Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.

C: RICK
D: Close your eyes... that's it... There's nothing to worry about... I love you... I'm a great guy... In two days you're gonna be Mrs. Great Guy.
E: continuing yawning
N: He yawns again and turns off the light on the night table. There is a beat of silence in the dark. We PUSH IN ON their faces, which are faintly illuminated by a street light outside the open window. Both of them have their eyes wide open as they stare at the ceiling in fearful anticipation of the next day.

C: LARRY
D: I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
C: O'NEILL
D: Larry, you and your wife got problems?
C: LARRY

C: LARRY
D: My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
C: RICK
D: Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C: LARRY
D: She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?

S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
N: This is a pretty plush place. The kind of hotel that prides itself on its classy image. The guys are totally unaware of the sedate atmosphere in the lobby as they go screaming toward the elevators.
C: O'NEILL
D: We who are about to go ape shit salute you.
E: to some dignified guests
C: RYKO
D: All right, I'm stoked!
N: Just as they are about to get into the elevator, a hand comes INTO FRAME and holds the door so it will not close. WIDEN TO INCLUDE the MANAGER. All their carrying-on stops when the guys see him staring grimly at them. If he wasn't a hotel manager, he'd be a mortician. He has a constant expression on his face that suggests he's constantly sucking lemons.
C: MANAGER
D: Just where do you guys think you are?
C: O'NEILL
D: The Library of Congress?
C: CHULO

S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
N: The guys all but dive into the room. It is a two-room suite with living room/kitcheonette and separate bedroom. The room has been decorated with balloons. A sign reads: "Happy Bachelor Party!" It looks far from professionally decorated. Chulo frantically checks out the rooms.
C: RYKO
D: Bitchin' place.
N: He hangs a chin-up bar in a doorway and starts to chin himself.
C: O'NEILL
D: I did the balloons myself.
N: He takes a prophylactic out of a Trojan carton. He blows it up. On closer examination, we SEE all the balloons are inflated prophylactics. ANOTHER ANGLE Chulo returns from his search of the rooms.
C: CHULO
D: Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
E: crazed
C: O'NEILL
D: Chulo, one thing at a time.
C: CHULO
D: Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
C: STAN
D: What's first?
C: O'NEILL

E: continuing
C: RICK
D: Olivier's in that, right?
C: O'NEILL
D: Then it's on to the real thing.
C: GUYS
D: All right!
E: cheering
N: Ryko flips off the lights as O'Neill puts the projector into forward and the title flashes on a movie screen. All the guys yell in anticipation. HOME MOVIE SCREEN We SEE a man stepping out of a shower. He puts on his robe and exits the bathroom. To his surprise and to the delight of our guys, two young, beautiful Nordic looking women, dressed in micro-minis and see-through blouses stand waiting for him.
C: CHULO
D: They're Danish, I know it. I'm crazy for Danes.
E: O.S.
N: RYKO AND CHULO sit watching the screen.
C: RYKO
D: Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
E: to Chulo
C: CHULO
D: I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
N: RICK AND O'NEILL
C: RICK
D: And I thought we wouldn't have any meaningful conversation.
E: to O'Neill
N: ON SCREEN The man takes off his robe. The girls start to seductively undress.
C: GUYS
D: All right, yeah, yeah, yeah...
E: O.S. excitedly
N: Suddenly an abrupt jump cut. The girls are undressed and lying on top of the man. Our guys are seriously let down. GUYS
C: EVERYONE
D: Awwww...
E: disappointed
N: O'NEILL He can't figure it out. ON THE SCREEN As the women kiss the man from his head slowly down his chest, past his navel and heading south... GUYS Their eyes start to widen like a child in a Keene painting.
C: GUYS
D: Yes, go, go, yes, go...
N: ON THE SCREEN Another abrupt jump cut spliced together with what looks like a band-aid, and the girls are sitting on the side of the bed. The man is recovering from the best sex he's ever encountered. GUYS
C: GUYS
D: Awwwwww...
E: disappointed
N: Rick turns to a shocked O'Neill.
C: RICK
D: Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
C: O'NEILL
D: This isn't right.
N: GUYS' POV They watch the screen. The two women seem to be taking a liking to each other. They begin to fall onto the bed and entwine.
C: GUYS
D: Please, yes, do it, yes, yes, oh yes...
N: A jump cut and they are dressing. Stan can't take it anymore. He jumps to his feet.
C: STAN
D: Where are the dirty parts? I'm a doctor. I can see these things.
C: CHULO
D: What a waste of two women.
N: O'Neill rises abruptly.
C: O'NEILL
D: I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
C: CHULO
D: Women!
E: in ecstasy
N: Everyone cheers.
S: INT. THOMERSON HOUSE
N: The girls are having a great time. The front DOORBELL RINGS. Mrs. Thomerson answers it. Standing in the doorway is Tina Stahl, Stan's wife; she's late for the shower. Behind her are two obvious hookers: Margot and Darlene. Tina doesn't know either of the girls.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: Yes?
N: Before Tina can speak, Margot speaks up. She's reading from the piece of paper Cole gave her.
C: MARGOT

S: INT. THOMERSON'S LIVING ROOM
N: Debbie spots Tina. She is oblivious to the two hookers.
C: DEBBIE
D: Tina!
N: They give each other a big hug. The hookers watch closely. Debbie leads Tina to the other women.
C: DEBBIE
D: You know everyone here, don't you?
E: continuing
C: TINA
D: Yes.
N: The girls hug and give big hellos. Meanwhile, Margot and Darlene have come to the conclusion they've been hired for a kinky scene.
C: MARGOT
D: One of these, huh?
C: DARLENE
D: Looks that way.
C: MARGOT
D: Buck's a buck.
N: They start to unbutton their coats. Tina hands Debbie her present.
C: DEBBIE
D: It's so heavy.
N: She sits and the girls gather around as she starts to open the gift. Phoebe happens to look off and is stunned by what she sees. The others are curious at what she is looking at and they too stare O.S., stunned to silence. MARGOT AND DARLENE dressed in leather and mesh stockings. Margot carries a whip. Darlene is holding a phallic electrical device.
C: DARLENE
D: Is there an empty outlet in here?
E: business-like
N: Debbie unconsciously points to a nearby wall. Margot and Darlene stand amidst the girls. Darlene plugs in her device. She and Margot start to embrace and fondle one another. The girls watch in stony silence. Dumbfounded at what they see. Margot and Darlene start to sink to the floor, OUT OF OUR SIGHT. Before they disappear, we see Margot take out her gum and park it on an end table. Now OUT OF SIGHT, the girls watch for a beat. Then we hear the WHIRRING of Darlene's implement. Our girls screech in horror and hold onto one another in a protective clump.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: The guys are sitting around drinking, eating and looking generally bored. Chulo sits in front of the TV, glumly watching an old "I Love Lucy" re-run.

D: How's it going, guys?
N: Everyone crowds around him like children greeting Daddy. Looking for candy hidden in his coat.
C: EVERYONE
D: Where's the girls? Where's the girls?
N: Rick pushes them away from Gary like a referee separating two fighters.
C: RICK
D: Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.

C: RICK
D: Well, I think you've done a damn fine job.
E: putting his arm around O'Neill
N: Everyone pelts Rick and O'Neill with more junk. Suddenly the door bursts open. The guys look up and are surprised to see Cole enter.

E: turns to the others

N: BACK TO SCENE Rick gestures to Chulo to look out the window.
C: RICK
D: Isn't that a great car, Chulo?
E: his voice tells us he has something in mind
N: Chulo gets Rick's drift.
C: CHULO
D: Yeah... real nice. Ah, excuse me. I'll be right back.

C: COLE
D: Great car.
C: RICK
D: The best.
C: COLE
D: I love that car.
C: RICK
D: I'm very happy for you two.

C: RICK
D: The car for Debbie?
E: surprised
C: COLE
D: I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
E: getting a little excitable
C: RICK
D: Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
N: All the guys treat this as if it's "Let's Make A Deal". They take sides, yelling out, "Take the car," "Keep Debbie." Over the din we hear a befuddled Rick.
C: RICK
D: What a decision here.
E: continuing
N: He walks over to the window. Cole follows closely. He's trying to convince Rick to take the car.
C: COLE
D: Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
C: RICK
D: So does Debbie.
S: EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Chulo is using the hanger to jimmy the car lock on Cole's Porsche. He's successful. He jumps into the car and drives off.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: Rick and Cole are at the window. The guys are still trying to convince Rick on his decision.
C: COLE
D: I got the car only two months ago -- it's got --

S: EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT
N: Gary spots Jumbo on the same grimy street corner. He's pimping for one of his ladies and makes a sale to an anxious young Marine as Gary approaches him.

D: What are you talking about, asshole?
C: GARY
D: Your whores never showed up.

C: JUMBO
D: I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?

D: Why?
C: JUMBO
D: Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
N: Gary hurriedly digs into his pockets and gives Jumbo his money.

C: JUMBO
D: Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
E: mock sincerity
N: He snaps his fingers and TWO of his LADIES come forward.

C: GARY
D: That's more like it.
N: The girls walk over to Gary and proceed to beat the crap out of him.
S: EXT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT
N: It is a garish nightclub. A large lighted billboard proclaims "ALL MALE... ALL NUDE." Two cars pull into the parking lot. Debbie and all of her shower guests get out.
C: DEBBIE
D: Are you sure this is a good idea?
C: ILENE
D: Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

D: Nick, if you would be so kind...
N: NICK He holds the tray with one hand. With the other he reaches OUT OF FRAME. In a nutshell, what he does is place his honker in the hot dog bun. As he slaps his business into the bun, we HEAR a solid THUMP.
C: RICK
D: Nick, the rest is all yours.
C: NICK
D: Gentlemen.

D: And then some.
N: Mrs. T. grabs the hot dog. It won't come off the tray. She yanks harder. Nick drops the tray and Mrs. T. finally comes to realize what she is pulling on. She screams in terror. Because of sheer fright, she can't seem to drop Nick's schlong from her grip. The rest of our ladies look to see Mrs. T. 's hot dog. They scream in shock. Debbie spits out her marguerita, hitting Phoebe in the face. OUR GUYS They are busting a gut watching the girls' reactions.
C: ILENE
D: She looks up just in time to see the guys close the kitchen door.
N: MRS. T still frozen in a state of shock. The girls try to pry her hands off.

N: She gestures to a MAN with his back TO US.
C: GARY
D: Let's talk.
N: The PIMP turns around and we SEE he is the stereotypical pimp. One big difference: he's an Indian straight from the streets of Calcutta. He's soft-spoken and ever smiling and he still hasn't quite mastered English.

D: What can I be doing for you?
E: oh-so-heavy Indian accent
C: GARY

C: GARY
D: Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
C: RAJAH
D: Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
C: GARY
D: Milt?
N: ANOTHER ANGLE MILT joins them. Milt is a massive hulk. A bearded exbiker. He could have come out of an MX silo. A menacing mountain of a man decked out in a cowboy hat.
C: RAJAH
D: This being Milt.
N: Milt casually takes off his hat and immediately sticks his face through a nearby window, smashing it to pieces. He pulls his head out, smiles and puts his hat back on.
C: RAJAH
D: Girls back in 45 minutes or Milt cuts your balls off. Fair enough? Shake!

D: I'm killing myself.
N: He takes a deep breath and submerges his head again. Rick unplugs the tub and it begins to drain.
C: RICK
D: Larry... you've got to lighten up. You and the wife can work it out.
N: The water has drained from the tub, leaving Larry high and dry. He lifts his head out of the tub. In his state, he's unaware that the water is gone. He gasps for air as Rick holds him up.
C: RICK
D: Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
C: LARRY
D: No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
N: Larry takes a deep breath and plunges his head into the tub. His head hits the waterless tub bottom with a loud THUD. He goes limp from the concussion. His body drapes into the tub, head first.
C: RICK
D: You okay?
C: LARRY
D: Yeah, I guess so.
C: RICK
D: Really?
C: LARRY
D: Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
N: Larry gets up and exits the room. PUSH IN ON Rick. He looks after Larry, concerned.
C: RICK
D: He ain't all right.
E: to himself
N: ANGLE - THE LOBBY Cole sits in a phone booth holding the receiver impatiently. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL THE ADJOINING PHONE BOOTH The receiver is off the hook. After a beat, Mr. T. crosses to the phone. Cole does not see him, and vice versa.

S: EXT. HOTEL
N: Cole comes bursting out into the street. We can tell by his shocked expression he doesn't like what he sees.
C: COLE
D: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
N: CAMERA PANS as he charges to his Porsche. His pride and joy has now, thanks to Chulo, been customized into a Chicano special. It's chopped and channeled; dingleberries rim the back window, flames have been painted on the rear fender; a chain steering wheel, fuzzy dashboard, dice hanging from the mirror. A real East L.A. beauty. ANGLE - COLE He's snapped -- totally flipped. He turns and yells up to the hotel:
C: COLE
D: Rick... Rick... Goddamn it.
E: screaming
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - ANGLE - RICK

E: yelling back
C: COLE
D: You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
E: furious

N: Rick is finishing giving the food order to a WAITER. In the b.g. we SEE O'Neill talking to a BELLHOP. The Bellhop is pointing to a table. O'Neill thanks him and slips him some money.
C: RICK
D: ...couple more on rye. Lots of fries... and a burger and diet soda.
N: Waiter acknowledges he's got it and exits. O'Neill joins Rick.
C: O'NEILL
D: Let's sit down.
N: O'Neill leads Rick to the table the Bellhop pointed out. They sit down. Immediately O'Neill takes some cash from his pocket and holds it under the table. ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE Huddled underneath the table, hidden by the tablecloth, is a HOOKER. Her specialty is coming right up. She grabs the bills from O'Neill's hand. She tucks the money in her cleavage and turns her talents to Rick. She unzips his fly. RICK He reacts to the ZIP SOUND.
C: RICK
D: What the hell is that?
C: O'NEILL
D: My gift to you.
C: RICK
D: Under the table!
C: O'NEILL
D: The best table in the house.
N: The Hooker has begun to do what she does best. And Rick loves it.
C: RICK
D: ...I think we can skip the wine list. Oh, gee...
N: FATHER FALWELL enters the restaurant. He spots Rick and O'Neill and crosses to them.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: Boys, good evening to you.
N: Rick tries to maintain his dignity. But from under the table a blue ribbon job is being applied to his fun zone.
C: O'NEILL
D: Father Falwell, good evening.
N: Falwell shakes Rick's hand. Rick hangs on for dear life. Pumping the hand up and down at a faster and faster rate.
C: RICK
D: Father... Oh, yes... yes... yesssss... Oh, yesssssss!
N: Falwell pries his hand loose.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: So, Rick, soon you will be a married man. How does it feel?
C: RICK
D: Innnnnn-credible!
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: Well, nice seeing you both.
N: Rick's excitement heightens as the Hooker pulls out all stops.
C: RICK
D: Ooooooooh, Jesus, Oh God, God, God, God, Oh Jesus, Jeeeesussss...
N: Father Falwell looks on rather perplexed. Rick sees Falwell's puzzled look.
C: RICK
D: I was just saying grace.
E: continuing
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: How nice.
C: O'NEILL
D: You done?
N: Before Rick can speak we HEAR a VOICE from under the table.
C: HOOKER
D: Not yet.
E: O.S.
N: Rick's hand EXITS FRAME and zips up his pants. Then Rick and O'Neill get up.
C: RICK
D: Father, would you like to take our table?
N: O'Neill can't believe what Rick is about to do.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: Yes. Thank you.
N: He sits in Rick's spot. Rick leans on the table to say his final farewell to the priest. He takes this moment to get some money out of his pocket and hold it under the table. UNDER THE TABLE The Hooker grabs the money. BACK TO SCENE
C: RICK
D: I think you'll enjoy this table.
C: O'NEILL
D: So long, Father.
N: He and Rick, suppressing a laugh, exit. Father Falwell picks up the menu. We HEAR the ZIP SOUND. Father perks up. He doesn't know what the hell is happening. O'Neill turns to Rick as they're leaving the coffee shop.
C: O'NEILL
D: I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
C: RICK
D: I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: Rick and O'Neill enter the suite. No one is there.
C: RICK
D: Where the hell is everybody?
N: Everyone jumps out from their hiding places. With our guys is Gary and his team of FIVE PROSTITUTES.
C: GARY
D: Surprise! The team bus just pulled in.
E: gesturing to the girls
C: STAN
D: Hookers. It's a party!
C: RICK
D: All right!
N: One of our hookers, KELLEY, gets everyone's attention.
C: KELLEY
D: Who's first, guys?
N: Everyone acts as if they're in grade school. They raise their hands; they come on like kids trying to get the teacher's attention.
C: GUYS
D: Oh, me... me... me!
C: O'NEILL
D: Wait. The guest of honor should be first.
C: RICK
D: Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
C: STAN
D: Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
C: O'NEILL
D: A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead off. I'll screw clean up.
N: Everyone cheers Stan's good fortune. Kelley takes Stan by the hand and leads him into the bedroom. Gary turns on a record and everyone starts dancing. Larry is laying out drugs on a table. They consist of lines of coke and various happy time pills of all colors and shapes. Rick takes a look at the layout.
C: RICK
D: How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Chulo enters. He sees the party has taken off.
C: CHULO
D: I have returned!
N: He spots a sweet-faced young hooker, LAVERNE. She is prancing around in her bra and underwear. Chulo wants her.
C: CHULO
D: You! Mine!
E: continuing; points to her
N: Laverne is frightened of Chulo. Mainly because he's coming at her like a sex-starved buffalo. Chulo goes after her. Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door. Chulo gives chase.
C: RICK
D: Chulo's got such a nice, light touch with women.
E: to O'Neill
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
N: Laverne runs down the hall, closely pursued by Chulo. An all- female NEW WAVE BAND comes to the door. O'Neill greets them.
C: O'NEILL
D: Terrific. You made it... You can set up over there...
N: As they enter we go to --
S: INT. CORRIDOR
N: Chulo is on the heels of Laverne. She bursts through a door to excape him.
S: INT. STAGE
N: Laverne finds herself on the stage of a beauty pageant, still in her bra and panties. FIVE other LADIES are dressed in their bathing suits. Chulo stops short of running on stage. Laverne, seeking the safety of the moment, stands in line with the contestants. ANGLE ON MR. THOMERSON AND OTHER JUDGES They like what they see.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Great bathing suit.
E: to another
T: EXECUTIVE
N: (indicating Laverne) I think I screwed that one once.
S: INT. THOMERSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Debbie and the shower guests are all in a state of undress. We WATCH as they put on dresses and heavy makeup. Mrs. Thomerson is still freaked out over her meeting with Nick the Dick.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: I had his weiner right in my hands.
C: ILENE
D: I told you. Men are pigs... I saw them standing there.
C: PHOEBE
D: What a gross thing to do... gawd!
C: ILENE
D: I bet right now Rick and his pals... ...are knee deep in whores.
E: she spits disdainfully
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: A strange wang right in my palm.
C: DEBBIE
D: Ilene, we don't really know that.
C: BOBBIE
D: That's what we're going to find out...
C: DEBBIE
D: I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
C: ILENE
D: Good. That's just what we're doing.
C: TINA
D: I'll kill Stan if I find out he's been screwing around.
N: Ilene shoves socks in her bra to enhance her cleavage and defiantly slaps on her new dress.
C: ILENE
D: Brett, are you with us?
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: Yeah, sure... I was eye to eye with an unfamiliar pud.
E: coming out of her fog
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: The party is taking off. The all-girl band is going ape shit. The guys are dancing with the hookers. They're all moving in unison, to a gyrating New Wave dance step and singing along with the MUSIC. ANGLE - RYKO He's wearing gravity boots, hanging upside down, entwined around one of the hookers. They're hanging there, making out like crazy. Gary passes by.
C: RYKO
D: Hey, Gary, spot me.
N: ANGLE - BEDROOM DOOR Stan comes out of the bedroom. He's disheveled, but looks very happy. He crosses to Rick.
C: STAN
D: Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
C: RICK
D: Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
C: STAN
D: Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
C: RICK
D: Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
N: Stan pats Rick on the back and dives into the festivities. ANGLE - GARY He spots someone across the room. It's like Tony spotting Maria for the first time in "West Side Story." As in a DREAM SEQUENCE, ALL SOUNDS STOP. Two pinspots hit them. She turns and sees him. She smiles. Both are madly in love. Like two pieces of metal attracted to the same magnet, they walk toward each other.
C: GARY
D: Hi.
C: SHE
D: Hello.
N: They take each other by the hand. They walk into the bedroom and close the door behind them. The New Wave dance briefly continues, then comes to an end. ANOTHER ANGLE - THE HOTEL ROOM O'Neill grabs Ryko (who is just coming down from his gravity bar) and Stan, who is wearing a pair of women's underwear on his head.
C: O'NEILL
D: You guys better get going. It's getting late.
C: STAN
D: Oh, right.
N: Ryko and Stan cross to the door and exit. As they do, four or five pretty GIRLS are passing by in the hallway.
C: GIRL
D: Is there a party going on in there or something?
C: RYKO
D: Yeah. It's great. Go on in.
N: The girls cross inside.
C: STAN
D: My God. Fresh meat. Let's hurry back.
S: INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON LARRY
N: There is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist. He heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor INTO FRAME. He turns it on and runs it over his wrist. Of course, nothing happens. Just then Rick enters.
C: RICK
D: What the hell are you doing?
C: LARRY
D: I'm trying to slash my wrists.
C: RICK
D: You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
C: LARRY
D: I couldn't find any razor blades.
C: RICK
D: Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
C: LARRY
D: Ha, ha, ha.
E: suddenly laughs like a crazy man
C: RICK
D: No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
N: As he shoves Larry out, Gary enters the bathroom. His expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life.
C: RICK
D: Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
C: GARY
D: Rick, I really think I'm in love.
C: RICK
D: This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
N: Rick exits as Gary dreamily crosses to the mirror.
C: GARY
D: This time it's real. She's wonderful.
E: into mirror
N: Gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet. Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away, then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open. Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his dress and turns to Gary.
C: SHE
D: The name's Tim. I'm always available.
N: He blows a kiss and starts to leave, but turns back.
C: SHE/TIM
D: By the way... I also do engine work on BMW's. 'Bye.
N: Tim exits. Gary feels filthy. He rips open the cabinet, takes out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his teeth. He rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat.
S: EXT. STABLES - NIGHT
N: Ryko and Stan drive up to a country stable. They get out of the car and open a barn door. Both are pleased at what they see.
C: RYKO
D: All right.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Standing there is a donkey, eating straw.
S: EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Cole drives up in his Chulo-customized Porsche. He gets out, then reaches back into the car and takes out a crossbow (the heavy duty metal kind hunters use). He looks up menacingly at the hotel and spots the room where the party is going on. He sees another hotel across the way. He gets an idea and enters the other hotel.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: The party is going full blast. Some other girls and a couple of guys (hotel guests) enter the room and are quickly swept up in the spirit of the party. O'Neill approaches Rick.
C: O'NEILL
D: Rick, I'm concerned.
C: RICK
D: About what?
C: O'NEILL
D: This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
C: RICK
D: Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
E: trying to joke his way out of it
C: O'NEILL
D: I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
C: RICK
D: Oooooo.
C: O'NEILL
D: Right in there, pal.
E: indicating the bedroom
C: RICK
D: If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
C: O'NEILL
D: That's the old Rick!
N: Rick enters the bedroom.
S: INT. BEDROOM
N: It's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on. In one corner of the room we SEE the figure of a woman.
C: RICK
D: Hellooo!
N: Tracey walks toward Rick. The light illuminates her. What we see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth. She is totally nude. A vision that would make any man screw and ask questions later.
C: RICK
D: Eat my chair!
E: to himself; overwhelmed by her
C: TRACEY
D: Take me... please.
N: Rick instinctively makes a move toward her. He decides to go for it. RICK'S POV - TRACEY Just then a strange thing happens to Tracey's face. It transforms into Debbies. ANOTHER ANGLE Rick stops dead in his tracks. He can't believe it. Debbie's face is now on Tracey's body.
C: TRACEY/DEBBIE
D: You promised me, Rick. You promised you wouldn't make love to anyone else.
N: Rick is shaken by this. He shakes his head and wipes at his eyes. Debbie's face is gone. He moves toward Tracey again. TRACEY Her face transforms into Sister Mary Francis.
C: TRACEY/SISTER MARY FRANCIS
D: Don't go back on your word, Rick. Be true; be strong.
N: Sister Mary Francis's face disappears. ANOTHER ANGLE
C: RICK
D: I can't do it.
N: TRACEY Her face becomes Stan's.
C: TRACEY/STAN
D: You nuts? Look at me, I'm beautiful!
N: Stan's face turns back to Tracey's. ANOTHER ANGLE All the kids from his bus are gathered around Tracey. They're egging him on.
C: KIDS
D: Do it! Come on! Put her away! Go for it!
N: Debbie's face appears on Tracey's.
C: TRACEY/DEBBIE
D: Don't Rick.
E: pleading
N: Debbie's face disappears. Rick can't take it anymore.
C: RICK
D: I can't do it. I love Debbie.
N: He runs out of the room, leaving a very confused Tracey in his wake.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM
N: O'Neill is waiting outside the bedroom door as Rick comes out.
C: O'NEILL
D: How'd it go?
C: RICK
D: Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
C: O'NEILL
D: I'm proud of you, lad.
N: Rick crosses to the bar area as O'Neill watches him go, beaming.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT
N: Cole enters the room. He runs to the window. COLE'S POV His window is right opposite the window in the hotel of Rick's party. COLE He's pleased. Very pleased. He places an arrow into his crossbow. COLE'S POV He's looking down his sights. Rick is the target... and an easy one at that, for at this very moment Rick is crossing past the window.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: The door opens and in walks Rajah, the Indian pimp. He looks pissed. He's looking for Gary.
C: RAJAH
D: Am looking for this dunghead who took my women... He is being liar to me. 45 minutes way over.
E: angry
N: COLE'S POV He has Rick right where he wants him. CROSSBOW TRIGGER Cole's finger squeezes off a shot. RICK Luckily he starts to dance with a female guest. This takes him out of line of the arrow. HOTEL SUITE WINDOW The arrow zooms through the open window.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: Rajah is standing by the door. The arrow zips through the room, misses everyone and lodges in the wall inches from Rajah's head. He looks at the arrow and realizes he almost was killed.
C: RAJAH
D: Holy Dung is this thing! I sic Milt on you. He get back bitches. Me? I haul ass.
E: frightened
N: He runs out of the room. Rick and O'Neill watch Rajah exit, confused.
C: RICK
D: Who was that?
C: O'NEILL
D: I don't know.
C: RICK
D: What's this?
E: looking at arrow
C: O'NEILL
D: Got me.
N: Just then another arrow comes zipping through the room, lodging in a chair inches from Rick.
C: RICK
D: How 'bout this?
E: to new arrow
C: O'NEILL
D: Still drawing a blank.
N: They turn in the direction the arrow came from and look out the window. They spot Cole loading his bow in the room across the way.
C: RICK
D: He look familiar?
C: O'NEILL
D: Very.
C: RICK
D: C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
N: They start for the door as we go to --
S: INT. BACKSTAGE OF BEAUTY PAGEANT
N: Chulo is waiting outside a door that says "Dressing Room." Several of the beauty contestants race out wearing formal gowns. Laverne follows them, wearing a very tight black dress. Chulo approaches her.
C: LAVERNE
D: Stay away from me.
C: CHULO
D: I'm not gonna hassle you... Don't worry. You look beautiful.
C: LAVERNE
D: Think so? I borrowed it from one of the girls. I don't look too fat?
E: nervous
C: CHULO
D: You're an angel... A madonna.
N: Laverne is moved by this. Before she can respond a Stage Manager takes her by the arm and pushes her on stage.
C: STAGE MANAGER
D: You're on.
N: Chulo watches Laverne enter the stage to hearty applause. ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE Mr. Thomerson and the other Judges sit in the front row making notes. MEDIUM SHOT - THE STAGE The girls are lined up on pedestals as the MC approaches Laverne
C: MC
D: All right, here is your question, Miss... Er...
N: He looks through his cards hurriedly and is unable to find Laverne's.
C: LAVERNE
D: Rivas.
C: MC
D: Miss Rivas... Yes... How would you solve our country's present economic problems?
C: LAVERNE
D: Who, me?
C: MC
D: Yes.
C: LAVERNE
D: That's a good question. From the way I understand it, according to supply side economics, when supply exceeds demand, recession is the result. That's why I think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate. That way, the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery.
N: ANGLE - THE CROWD They break into spontaneous applause. ANGLE - CHULO He is totally blown away. ANGLE - LAVERNE She smiles broadly at the applause and walks off stage. Chulo moves alongside her.
C: CHULO
D: How'd you know all that stuff? You're a real brain.
C: LAVERNE
D: Nah, I used to fuck a librarian.
N: Chulo looks at her with awe and respect as she exits into the dressing room.
C: CHULO
D: Wow!
S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
N: Debbie, her mother and the girls enter the lobby. They approach the Hotel Manager, who is standing behind the front desk. They are dressed garishly, like hookers. Debbie has on a cheap blonde wig and mini skirt. The Manager looks at them the way one would look at an approaching plague.
C: DEBBIE
D: I don't believe we're doing this.
N: The Manager crosses to them.
C: MANAGER
D: Can I help you, ladies?
C: DEBBIE
D: Yes, we're looking for the Stahl party.
C: MANAGER
D: Room 1002.
N: The girls turn and start toward the elevator. Mrs. Thomerson, who is wearing the kind of push-up bra that makes her tits look like the Black Hills, smiles at the Manager seductively. He smiles back, then catches himself.
C: MANAGER
D: Those guys are asking for it.
E: to Bellboy
N: The girls cross to the elevator. Ilene pushes the button and the doors swing open. They get inside and just before the doors close, a huge behemoth of a man joins them inside. He turns and faces CAMERA. It's Milt, Rajah's beefy helper. He doesn't look happy as he eyes the girls. They look back at him uncomfortably as the doors slam shut.
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
N: The elevator door opens. Milt has all the girls by the collar and hustles them down the hall.
C: ILENE
D: You're making a big mistake.
C: MILT
D: Shut up. You still got another job to do here.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
C: DEBBIE
D: Quiet, Mother.
N: Milt stops at a door and kicks it with his foot. The door opens a crack at first, then swings open wide, revealing six middle-aged Japanese business MEN in their underwear. They smile wide at the girls, obviously thrilled with the quality of the merchandise delivered to them. Milt shoves them into the room.
C: MILT
D: Get in there.
N: He slams the door shut and exits.
S: INT. JAPANESE GUYS' ROOM
N: The guys start to move toward our panicked girls. They speak to each other in Japanese (with English subtitles)
C: JAPANESE ONE
D: Nice looking quim, huh, Bob?
C: JAPANESE TWO
D: Yeah, you know me, Ray, I've always been a sucker for redheads.
C: JAPANESE FOUR
D: Hubba-hubba.
C: BOBBIE
D: Let's get out of here, girls.
N: They turn toward the door. One of the Japanese races over and gets there first, slamming and bolting the door shut.
C: DEBBIE
D: Guys, take it easy. Guys.
N: The girls run around the room in a panic with the Japanese chasing them in very hot pursuit.
S: EXT. COLE'S ROOM
N: Rick, O'Neill and Tracey quietly approach Cole's door. Tracey is dressed in a see-through negligee.
C: RICK
D: This is it. Go get 'im.
E: he positions Tracey outside the door
N: He and O'Neill duck around the hallway corner, out of sight.
S: INT. COLE'S ROOM
N: He is at the window, holding his crossbow. He is frantically searching the bachelor party across the way for any sign of Rick.
C: COLE
D: Where the hell is he?
N: He hears a KNOCK on the DOOR. Cole quickly hides his crossbow under the bed and answers the door. ANOTHER ANGLE Tracey stands in the open door. Cole's jaw drops open. He has never seen anything as lovely.

D: Make love to me... please.
N: She walks into the room. Cole closes the door.
S: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COLE'S DOOR

N: e and O'Neill burst into the room and close the door.

N: O'Neill is tying the end of a sheet around the bed post. We SEE the bed is minus its sheets and blankets.
C: O'NEILL
D: All set here.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE The guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made a rope. The other end is tied around Cole's chest. And that's all Cole is wearing; he's nude.
C: COLE
D: You guys are never going to get away with this.
N: Rick stuffs Cole's underwear in his mouth to gag him.
C: RICK
D: We're just going to keep you in a safe place until after the party.
N: He and O'Neill lift Cole up and put him out the window. They hang onto the sheet/blanket rope and lower him slowly outside.
S: EXT. HOTEL
N: We SEE Cole being lowered from the window. CLOSER ON COLE He's struggling, but can do nothing about his predicament. He looks down. COLE'S POV The hotel parking lot is ten stories below. COLE He looks up to the guys. RICK AND O'NEILL They look down at him from the window above.

N: We SEE that Cole's weight is pulling the bed to the window. COLE He's slowly lowering down the side of the building.
S: INT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM
N: A YOUNG COUPLE enters the room. They are very much in love. He gives her a kiss and closes the door.
C: MAN
D: Why don't you get comfortable?
N: She smiles coyly and starts to undress. He crosses to the closed blinds.
C: MAN
D: There's a wonderful moon out tonight.
E: continuing

C: JAPANESE/RAY

E: subtitled
S: INT. COLE'S ROOM
N: The bed moves right up against the wall under the window. We SEE the end tied to the bed post is beginning to untie. COLE He's panicked.
S: INT. COLE'S ROOM
N: The knot unties. COLE He falls OUT OF FRAME. The "rope" trailing behind.
S: INT. CAR
N: The young couple from the room are seated in his sportscar. He's cranking open the sun roof.
C: MAN
D: Babe, I didn't know anything about that.
N: The sun roof opens. Suddenly Cole's ass sticks through it. The Woman freaks out again.

S: INT. BANQUET ROOM - BACKSTAGE
N: Chulo and Laverne are standing in the wings while in the b.g. we can SEE the MC singing the Moosehead Beer jingle. Then:
C: MC

D: I can't believe it. This is the happiest day of my life, and I owe it all to him.
E: teary-eyed
N: She points O.S. to Chulo, Chulo, with tears in his eyes, comes out on stage and, in a surge of emotion, picks Laverne up off her feet and hugs her passionately. ANGLE - THE JUDGES
C: JUDGE

C: RYKO
D: I don't know.
C: STAN
D: What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
C: RYKO
D: Maybe I did... I don't remember.
C: STAN
D: I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
E: through clenched teeth
N: ANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE Just then the "Moose" from the beauty pageant steps outside the hotel for a smoke. The guy in front removes the head, takes a drag of his cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear. After a beat, smoke steams out the rear end of the costume. ANGLE - THE GUYS IN THE CAR They both have the same idea. They stroll out of the car and approach the two men in the moose suit. We can't hear what they're saying, but we can SEE the bills Stan is taking out of his pocket. Ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the trailer with it.
S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: The door opens and Stan and Ryko enter pulling the "Moose" by a rope.
C: RYKO
D: Can you believe how perfect it fits?
C: STAN
D: Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
N: Just then Rick and O'Neill saunter into the lobby.
C: O'NEILL
D: Hey, you guys...
C: RICK
D: Who's your friend?
C: STAN
D: Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
E: keeping it a surprise
C: RICK
D: Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
E: to moose
N: At that moment he HEARS a SPLAT hit the ground. The guys look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown excrement nestled in the shag carpet.
C: RICK
D: Say no more.
E: continuing
N: The Manager crosses to them.
C: MANAGER
D: I don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess.
C: O'NEILL
D: Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something?
E: resigned
N: All the guests turn away in disgust. Stan takes out a handkerchief and hands it to Rick, who closes his eyes and picks up the warm little bundle. The Manager turns and walks off in a huff. On the way back to the elevator, Rick checks to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's contents on the front desk, just OUT OF FRAME. Smiling contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the elevator. The doors slam shut. ANGLE AT THE DESK The Manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out of town.
C: MANAGER
D: I'll have the boy take your bags up.
N: He goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes down on something soft and mushy. The look on his face tells us what it is. It's the "gift" Rick left behind.
C: MANAGER
D: Excuse me. I seem to have a hand full of potty.
E: to couple
N: Revolted, he races into a room marked "MEN." ANGLE - BALLROOM DOORS The doors open and several people from the Moosehead beauty pageant come out. Mr. Thomerson is one of them.
T: EXECUTIVE
N: Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Any time, Al.
N: Mr. T. crosses to the door just as Cole comes running in, slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet that held him suspended out the window. They both are shocked to see one another.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
C: COLE
D: The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
E: nearly hysterical
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
N: COLE
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
E: disgusted
C: COLE
D: Yes, sir.
N: With a determined look, Thomerson crosses to the elevator, as Cole runs into the hotel gift shop.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
N: Rick, Ryko, Stan, O'Neill enter with the "moose."
C: RICK
D: Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
C: LARRY
D: It's Bullwinkle.
C: O'NEILL
D: Gentlemen... Ladies... For your viewing pleasure, meet Mike the Magical Sexual Mule.
N: O'Neill lifts the head off the moose costume, revealing a real burro. The burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt to do when excited. O'Neill and Stan zip off the rest of his costume, revealing a well-endowed beast.
C: RICK
D: How about this, a Trojan donkey.
E: surprised
C: O'NEILL
D: And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
N: DESIREE, an erotic, tall woman wearing a leather face mask, comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip. Desiree puts Ravel's "Bolero" on the PHONOGRAPH; then she starts to sway her hips sensuously in front of the animal. ANGLE - THE PARTY GUESTS They all scream and holler approval. ANGLE - DESIREE She rubs up against the donkey, shaking her backside against the animal's.
C: RICK
D: Swell. She's gonna pin her tail on the donkey.
N: Now all eyes are on Desiree as she does an erotic striptease. ANGLE - THE DONKEY It is getting bored and a little hungry. It bends its head to the left and spots the table with food on it. It bends over and starts munching on some cole slaw. ANGLE - DESIREE To the catcalls of the partygoers, Desiree is getting all worked up, stripping down to a G-string. THE DONKEY It's had enough cole slaw. Now it sniffs at Larry's drug smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. Next it sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in one gigantic sniff. ANGLE - DESIREE She lets her long, flowing hair hang down over her breasts. Then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor. She rolls on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees. ANGLE - HER AUDIENCE Rick can't believe he's seeing this. The other guys are screaming at the top of their lungs. Even Larry seems spell- bound. ANGLE - THE DONKEY It doesn't look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the table. ANGLE - DESIREE She moves over to the donkey, hits him on the side gently with her whip, then pulls him over to her mattress. The donkey's blood-shot eyes are the size of saucers. Once again he shows his teeth in a kind of shit-eating grin. Desiree drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her. Mike the Donkey obediently does as he's told, moving to her in a trance-like, very turned-on state.
C: DESIREE
D: C'mon, Mike... Come to Mama.
N: The Donkey takes another step forward, and then suddenly rears up on his hind legs, snorting. He starts bucking wildly. The crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk for a few seconds, then without warning collapses in a heap on the floor. Everyone goes rushing up to it. Chulo and Laverne enter the room, followed by several of the other contestants and others from the beauty pageant.
C: CHULO
D: Hey, you guys, I'm getting married. We're gonna make lots of kids.
E: excited to Laverne
N: He looks over and sees everyone gathered around Mike.
C: CHULO
D: What the hell happened?
N: Gary shushes him. We PUSH IN ON Dr. Stan, who is listening for signs of life in the animal's chest. Finally Stan stands up somberly.
C: STAN
D: Drug overdose.
C: DESIREE
D: You mean it's...
C: STAN
D: Afraid so. I did everything I could.
C: LARRY
D: It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
C: RICK
D: It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
C: O'NEILL
D: C'mon, we gotta get this thing out of here.
N: O'Neil places the moosehead on the donkey as Rick, Gary, Chulo and Stan pull the donkey out into the hall like pallbearers at a funeral.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Mr. Thomerson, who's been standing at the door, takes this time to sneak into the suite right behind them.
S: INT. RICK'S SUITE
N: Mr. Thomerson can't believe the goings-on. People are making out, drinking and dancing. He hides in a corner to watch undercover. ANGLE IN CORRIDOR The guys shove the donkey onto the elevator and the doors snap shut.
S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
C: MANAGER
D: Yes... I see... Of course we don't allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. No... Well, I'm sorry the noise woke you. I'll take care of it right away.
E: on phone
N: He hangs up and crosses to the elevator.
C: MANAGER
D: I've had enough of this.
N: Just then the elevator door swings open. The donkey falls out into the lobby. The Manager screams in terror, as do several of the hotel guests.
C: MANAGER
D: That's it. I'm calling the cops.
E: continuing
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
N: Some more uninvited guests come drifting into the room.
C: RICK
D: Welcome, welcome, one and all.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Rick!
E: O.S.
C: RICK
D: Oh, no!
E: recognizing the voice
N: He turns and spots Mr. Thomerson as he makes his way through the party.
C: RICK
D: Christ... it's Mr. Laughs.
N: Mr. Thomerson goes nose to nose with Rick.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: This is it. You're through. When Debbie hears about this she'll never see you again. Now I'm calling the cops to break up this sex orgy... And toss your ass in jail!
N: He turns away and walks OUT OF FRAME. O'Neill crosses to Rick.
C: O'NEILL
D: What are you going to do about it?
C: RICK
D: What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
E: defeated
C: O'NEILL
D: I'll stop him... You stall him.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Mr. Thomerson is heading for the phone in the bedroom.
C: RICK
D: Mr. Thomerson!
N: Thomerson stops and turns to Rick.
C: RICK
D: Please, no. Don't ruin my life. Please!
E: continuing; dramatic
N: He drops to his knees and hugs Thomerson's legs. The party stops and everyone watches.
C: RICK
D: It's not me. I was brought up on the wrong side of the tracks. A victim of my environment...
E: continuing
S: INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - O'NEILL AND LARRY
N: Larry is handing O'Neill a plastic bag filled with white powder.
C: O'NEILL
D: Is that all the coke in the place?
C: LARRY
D: That's it.
C: O'NEILL
D: Good.
N: O'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the bag of cocaine into the phone. He then screws the mouthpiece back on over this mound of powder. Satisfied with his work, he exits the bedroom.
S: INT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM
N: Thomerson is trying to free himself from Rick's grasp as Rick continues with his "hard luck" story.
C: RICK
D: My poor old mammy had to take in laundry. My pappy had to work 20 hours a day at the Pez Factory.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE O'Neill gestures to Rick that everything's ready. Rick immediately jumps to his feet.
C: RICK
D: The end.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: No sob story is going to change my mind.
N: Mr. Thomerson pushes O'Neill aside and enters the bedroom.
C: O'NEILL
D: The phone's all yours.
N: Mr. Thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. As he does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. He screams at Rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he dials. Each move produces a large cloud of powder, which causes him to sniffle slightly.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: I never liked you. I've never liked any of your friends. I've hated you from the first time I saw you. And now you are out of my life. You are out of my life!
N: He starts to react from inhaling the powder. He puts the receiver to his ear. He takes a deep breath and tries to dial another number. A large cloud of coke flies up his nose. He's stunned. He takes another deep drag. He's hooked. He forgets all about dialing. He jams the receiver against his nose and takes deep drag after deep drag. Desiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and sits down next to him on the bed. He gives her a big, wide smile. O'Neill closes the door.
C: O'NEILL
D: Reach out and snort someone.
C: RICK
D: I'm saved. Let's party!
N: Everyone starts to whoop it up again.
S: INT. JAPANESE SUITE
N: It's still a standoff between the girls and the horny Japanese.
C: DEBBIE
D: Let's give them what they want.
C: PHOEBE
D: What?
N: Debbie opens the bedroom door and motions for the Japanese to file in.
C: DEBBIE
D: Let's go. Everyone inside.
N: The Japanese immediately put two and two together and get orgy. These are some happy fellas as they enter the bedroom.
C: BOBBIE
D: Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
C: DEBBIE
D: Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
E: herding in the last Japanese
N: The Japanese man enters the room. Debbie slams the door shut behind him.
C: DEBBIE
D: Let's go.
C: ILENE
D: Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
C: DEBBIE
D: Ilene, are you crazy?
C: ILENE
D: I know what I'm doing... Go!
N: The girls run out the door.
S: INT. JAPANESE BEDROOM
N: Ilene smiles. She has what she wants. She walks into the bedroom, surrounded by panting Japanese.
C: ILENE
D: Gentlemen, the gods have answered your prayers... Bonzai!
N: She takes a running leap and dives on top of the Japanese.
S: INT. CORRIDOR
N: Debbie and the ladies run to an elevator. Debbie presses the "down" button.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: I hope Ilene's all right.
C: DEBBIE
D: I hope those guys are all right.
N: The elevator door opens, revealing the donkey lying flat on his back. His stiff legs point skyward. The girls see him and scream. They run down the hall to the stairway. On the way Debbie notices she's passing Room 1002. She HEARS the party SOUNDS inside. She heads for the room angrily. This is a lady out to even a score.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
N: As Debbie opens the door, her father walks by with Desiree on his arm. Neither sees the other. Debbie enters the room. She is surprised by the masses of humanity rubbing shoulders with one another in the room. O'Neill looks over from the other side of the room and spots her. He isn't fooled for a minute by her wig and mini skirt. He runs over to Rick.
C: O'NEILL
D: Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
C: RICK
D: Who?
C: O'NEILL
D: Debbie.
C: RICK
D: My Debbie?
C: O'NEILL
D: What's with her costume?
N: O'Neill points and Rick sees Debbie. She doesn't see them.
C: RICK
D: I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
E: continuing
C: O'NEILL
D: You got it.
N: O'Neill crosses to Debbie.
C: O'NEILL
D: Hi, baby. You're new here. I don't think the groom's had you yet, has he?
E: continuing
N: PUSH IN ON Debbie. She's pissed.
C: DEBBIE
D: No, not yet. Where is he?
S: INT. BEDROOM
N: Rick opens the door from the bathroom. The lights are turned off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside the window we can MAKE OUT the outline of Debbie's body on the bed.
C: RICK
D: I can't see anything.
N: Debbie, in a disguised Southern accent, speaks out.
C: DEBBIE
D: Don't turn on the lights, sugar. I'll lead you around.
E: seductively
C: RICK
D: How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
C: DEBBIE
D: Why don't you get undressed.
N: Rick starts to undress. While undressing, he takes on the persona of Mr. Rodgers. He sings Rodgers' opening theme in that same sappy, child-like manner of his.
C: RICK
D: It's a lovely day in the neighborhood. It's a lovely day, it's a beauty, would you be mine, could you be mine. ...Please won't you be my neighbor. Hi... Hi there... Today we're going to learn about anatomy...
E: singing he's now stripped down to his underwear as Mr. Rodgers
N: He jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately. Debbie snaps on the lights. She throws off her wig and she and Rick come face to face.
C: RICK
D: Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't believe it!
E: continuing
N: She all but jumps out of bed.
C: DEBBIE
D: I can't trust you!
C: RICK
D: C'mon, I knew it was you.
C: DEBBIE
D: Rick, you're lying!
E: holding back tears
N: As Rick protests, she throws on her blouse and runs out of the room. Rick charges after her.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - MAIN ROOM
N: The place is wall to wall people. ANGLE - DEBBIE She tries to make her way to the exit, but her path is slowed by all the happy revelers.
C: DEBBIE
D: Let go of me!
E: yelling over the din; furious
C: RICK
D: Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
E: yelling back
C: DEBBIE
D: The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
C: RICK
D: I don't want that. I want to be with you.
C: DEBBIE
D: And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
C: RICK
D: I am committed. I love you.
N: Just then Desiree and Mr. Thomerson cross THROUGH FRAME. She's leading him around by the silver chain, which is now attached to his neck. She's also carrying a leather whip.
C: DEBBIE
D: I don't believe you.
C: RICK
D: You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
N: Rick gets up on the sofa and yells loudly over the din.
C: RICK
D: People! Can I have your attention... people!
E: continuing
N: Everyone stops what they're doing and looks up.
C: RICK
D: I want to ask you all a question. Have I had sex with anybody in this room tonight?
E: continuing
N: There's a negative response from the crowd.
C: RICK
D: Are you sure?
E: continuing
N: Everyone responds positively.
C: RICK
D: Thank you.
E: continuing
N: All the guests go back to partying. Rick drops off the sofa and faces Debbie.
C: RICK
D: See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
E: continuing
C: DEBBIE
D: Yes...
E: melted
C: RICK
D: Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
C: DEBBIE
D: Let's get naked.
E: sexy
C: RICK
D: You're on.
N: She takes him by the hand and crosses into the other bedroom.
S: INT. OTHER BEDROOM
N: Rick and Debbie enter. To their surprise they find a man wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking Desiree's boots, which she dangles in front of him. She also holds a whip over his head. Despite the mask, there is something very familiar about his face, and the white powder encrusted all over his nose. Debbie picks up on this immediately.
C: DEBBIE
D: Daddy?
E: shocked
N: Sure enough, Mr. Thomerson looks up and grimaces, knowing he's been caught with his bondage down. He tries to say something, but the boot in his mouth prevents anything intelligent from coming out.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
C: RICK
D: Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
S: INT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM
N: The party has reached fever pitch. Suddenly police SIRENS pierce through the party sounds. Everyone freezes. We HEAR the Hotel Manager BEATING on the DOOR with his fists.
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
N: The Manager is pounding on the door. By his side are several UNIFORMED POLICE.
C: MANAGER
D: You're all under arrest. Open up!
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE
C: RICK
D: Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
E: to everyone in the room
N: Everyone starts to panic and run for the doors.
C: RICK
D: I'm glad no one is panicking.
E: continuing
N: He snaps up his clothes from the bedroom.
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
C: MANAGER
D: Break it in, boys!
E: to Police
N: The cops rear back for a run at the door. At that moment the hotel door opens up and the cops and the Manager are trampled by Rick, Debbie, Mr. Thomerson, Rick's gang, other guests and assorted hookers. They run down the stairs. The cops pick themselves up and give chase. The Manager looks inside the room and is devastated by what he sees... Hiroshima looked better after the A-bomb.
S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
N: We SEE the police have collared Bobbie, Phoebe, Mrs. Thomerson and the other ladies of the shower as hooker suspects. Our bachelor party mob now charges down the stairs and out the hotel doors. The cops grab Mr. Thomerson as he tries to get out, and they throw him in line with the others. Unfortunately for him, he's standing next to Mrs. Thomerson.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: Ed! What are you doing here?
N: Before he can answer, Mrs. Thomerson checks out his shocking leather outfit.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: Ed... you're kinky!
E: angry
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: The phone made me do it!
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: You've been having strange sex...!
E: shocked
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: No, Brett, I...
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: It's all right... So have I.
E: proudly
N: He is totally blown away by this as the cops lead them out of the room.
C: MRS. THOMERSON
D: I've seen another man's diddly.
S: EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
N: Our people pile out of the hotel. Rick, Debbie and all Rick's friends run down the street. Suddenly a Porsche pulls up between Rick and Debbie. It's Cole. He reaches over and pulls Debbie into the car with him. She screams.
C: RICK
D: Cole, what the hell are you doing?
C: COLE
D: She's mine!
N: He drives off.
C: RICK
D: He's kidnapped her! Everyone into the bus!
N: They all board the bus.
S: EXT. CITY STREET
N: As Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship.
S: INT. PORSCHE
C: COLE
D: Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
N: He looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them. Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs OUT OF FRAME.
S: EXT. CITY STREET
N: A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely placing orange cones in the center line of the road. Cole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed.
S: INT. RICK'S BUS
N: Rick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over. MAINTENANCE TRUCK Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY
N: Rick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught up with Cole.
S: EXT. STREET
N: The vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles back into the parking lot.
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT
N: Cole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into the theater entrance. Rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out of the bus.
C: COLE
D: He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
C: RICK
D: Fan out and look for them.
N: They all go running into various theaters. ANGLE - RYKO He approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie playing inside.
C: RYKO
D: Aw, I've seen this one already.
N: Rick chooses a theater and goes inside.
S: INT. MOVIE THEATER
N: The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. He gives chase and catches up with Cole. He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman. A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth.
C: MAN
D: Gee, what a realistic effect.
E: to LADY next to him
C: WOMAN
D: Yeah, like you're in the movie with them.
N: Rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle.
C: PATRON
D: Best 3D I've ever seen.
E: to his date
N: As the movie ends, Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging him out of the theater.
S: INT. MALL OUTSIDE THEATER
N: Rick exits the theater with Cole. He tosses Cole to Chulo. Debbie comes running behind Rick.
C: RICK
D: Are you okay?
E: to Debbie
C: DEBBIE
D: Yeah.
C: RICK
D: This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
C: DEBBIE
D: You're so romantic...
E: hugging him
N: The Patrons are exiting. All of them are very up and excited by their 3D experience.
C: WOMAN
D: Absolutely amazing.
N: A Man who has taken a punch and has had his jacket ripped to shreds doesn't seem pleased.
C: MAN
D: I've seen better.
S: EXT. BLUFF - DAY
N: It's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. Just right for Rick and Debbie's wedding. We SEE the wedding in progress. The area is adorned with flowers. The many guests are seated and taken in the moment. Among these are Tracey, Desiree and Gary's she-man, who waves to Gary as he stands with the other ushers, Chulo, Ryko and Larry. Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. He looks over at Laverne, who smiles to him.
C: CHULO
D: Hey, man, don't forget my bachelor party's next Friday night.
E: to Ryko
C: GARY
D: I'll get the hookers.
C: RYKO
D: No way.
N: Nearby stand the maids of honor, Bobbie, Phoebie and Ilene, who blows a kiss to her date, Ray (one of the Japanese businessmen). The Thomersons sit in the front row. Neither of them is cherishing this moment.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: We'll have morons for grandkids. But... at least we'll have grandkids.
E: sotto; to Mrs. Thomerson resigned to the fact
N: They sort of smile at each other at the thought. Father Falwell is almost through with the ceremony. A car pulls up in the b.g. Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN. O'Neill, the best man, sees the car. He pokes Rick. He indicates to Rick someone has arrived. STAN We SEE the man in the car is Stan. He ushers the lady in the car to Larry. He's surprised at who she is: his wife.
C: LARRY
D: Sue!
C: SUE
D: Hi, honey.
C: LARRY
D: How'd you get here?
C: SUE
D: Rick called me.
N: Larry looks to Rick and gives him a warm smile and a wave. Rick acknowledges Larry.
C: LARRY
D: Why don't we go someplace and talk.
N: They walk off. FATHER FALWELL
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: Now, before I pronounce you man and wife, the groom wishes to recite his vow to Debbie. Richard.
C: THOMERSONS
D: They fear the worst.
C: MR. THOMERSON
D: Oh, God Almighty.
N: RICK He turns to Debbie. He waits a beat and begins.
C: RICK
D: Cheese. I love you more than cheese. And I love cheese a lot.
C: THOMERSONS
D: They hide their faces in their hands. Off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. The wind begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick continues his soliloquy.
C: RICK
D: In fact, more than dairy products in general. I love dairy. My love is cream. Pour me on the cereal of your life...
N: Now it starts to rain. FATHER FALWELL He wants this to end. He calls softly to Rick, trying to get his attention.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: Rick. Rick. Hey...
N: People begin to scurry for cover. In the b.g., under a tree, we SEE Larry and his wife huddled in each other's arms. From the way they look, they have worked things out. RICK
C: RICK
D: I think this song pretty much sums up the way I feel at this moment.
N: He begins to sing the theme from "The Flintstones" with all the gusto of Jack Jones. Father Falwell has had enough.
C: FATHER FALWELL
D: I now pronounce you man and wife. Goodbye.
E: rapid fire
N: He blesses them lightning fast and springs for his car. THE SCENE CREDITS ROLL as Rick continues to sing in the driving rain. Debbie joins in on the chorus. She loves her man. Everyone has run for the safety of their cars. Everyone but the Thomersons, who sit and look on bewildered.
C: RICK AND DEBBIE
D: "Flintstones, meet the Flintstones They're a prehistoric family From the town of Bedrock They're a page right out of history..."
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
