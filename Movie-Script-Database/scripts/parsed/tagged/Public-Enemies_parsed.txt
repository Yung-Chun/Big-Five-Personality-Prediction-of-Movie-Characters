C: PONTIAC
D: is parked at the curb. It waits.
S: INT. PONTIAC - "RED" HAMILTON ( 34)

C: HAMILTON
D: Time. Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER is in the backseat. He nods. His arms are behind him. We don't know why. Red starts the car and drives forward.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, MICHIGAN CITY, INDIANA - LINE OF
C: CONVICTS
D: Its cold.-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed. This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair, broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz, Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line.
C: PRISON GUARDS
D: in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line, poised to unleash violence.
N: AMONG THE HARD MEN ARE... HARRY "PETE" PIERPONT (32), 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes. Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority. CHARLES MAKLEY ( 44), squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars and as calm as Pierpont is volatile. HOMER VAN METER (27), tall, an incorrigible clown and an unemotional killer. He has continued to ridicule guards even when it cost him months in the hole.
C: THESE THREE
D: with an older man, WALTER DIETRICH, wait for the lam. work call to the prison Shirt Factory...
S: INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, GATEHOUSE - TURNKEY

C: TURNKEY
D: Afternoon. Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have entered. Meanwhile...

Lamm, an ex-Prussian soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying military tactics and who rode with Butch & Sundanc4's Hole in the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on Lamm's techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..'ohn Herbert Dillinger.

D: Yes, sir. Three months ago.
C: TURNKEY
D: . John... Johnnie Dillinger?
C: DILLINGER
D: That's right. But my friends call me "Johnnie". You gotta address me as "Mister" Dillinger. Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his head and swing it onto the Two Guards...
C: RED/DILLINGER
D: Against the wall! Hands up! Get up! Dillinger's cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the stunned pokerÂ°players. Hamilton and Dillinger are as tight as they come.- They share their food, money, liquor, ammunition and women. ,.id right now...
C: YARD GATE
D: is keyed open by Dainard followed by Pierpont and Makley and the others. Pierpont kicks over the poker table. Escapees throw all the Guards against the wall.
C: MAKLEY/VAN METER
D: Undress. Get undressed!
E: to the Guards
C: DILLINGER
D: at the window checks the escape route to the Pontiac. Its clear. Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out. Smooth. He crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so good...
S: INT. GATE HOUSE - GUARDS
N: undress. One takes his time.
C: SHOUSE
D: Hurry up! C'mon!
N: This Guard gives Shouse an insolent look. Shouse slams the Guard's head with a length of steel pipe. Guard goes down. Shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and again, caving it in.
C: PIERPONT
D: Cut it out Shouse!
C: DILLINGER
D: Shouse!I Dainard thinks that once the killing's begun, he will die... So, he grabs for Homer Van Meter's .45. Van Meter SHOOTS Dainard. Dainard's knocked to the floor. Blood pools. A SIREN SCREAMS.

C: BANG!
D: Dietrich is hit in the neck by rifle FIRE from the East Tower.
C: DILLINGER
D: Walter! Dillinger falls away. Dillinger and Pierpont grab Walter's arms. He's-paralyzed now. They try to pull him onto the running boafd, of the moving car. Dietrich's"hcpeful eyes look up at them. Then his eyes glaze over. His feet drag down the street. He's dead and they know it. They let go.
S: EXT. STREET - DIETRICH'S
N: body remains in the center of the street. The Pontiac picks up speed.
S: INT. PONTIAC - HAMILTON
N: drives like he has no nerves. Totally focused. Hamilton is the best getaway, or "git" driver in the country.
C: DILLIN GER' S
D: Thompson empty, he grabs Red's shotgun. He shoves it into Shouse's chest in the backseat.
C: DILLINGER
D: Walter's dead 'cause you screwed it up, you son of a bitch!
C: SHOUSE
D: The bastard wouldn't do what he was told, Johnny. .Pete? Homer?
C: VAN METER
D: Let him have it.
C: PIERPONT
D: Dietrich was your pal, up to you. Dillinger sees the abject fear in Shouse's eyes. And Dillinger's mood swings. He lowers the shotgun... Then, he snaps the butt across Shouse's face. Breaks Shouse's cheekbone. Dillinger pulls back and slams the heavy butt dead center, smashing Shouse's nose and orbital socket. Dillinger opens the door and kicks Shouse out of the moving car.
S: EXT. FARM ROAD - SHOUSE
N: bounces and rolls across the road into a field. The Pontiac races away into the distance.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PERU, INDIANA - CROSSROADS - LATER

C: DILLINGER
D: I'm sorry, honey. Pierpont, Homer and Makley head towards the Plymouth.
S: INT. PONTIAC - DILLINGER,
N: as the Pontiac pulls away, looks back to see Viola wistfully watching them leave. The toddler reaches for Viola's hand. She pushes the child away. Dellinger hates seeing the kid rejected.
C: HAMILTON

C: HAMILTON
D: Johnnie? All there? Dillinger lifts the coats on the backseat: their weapons are as they were.
E: CONT'D
C: DILLINGER
D: Its all here.

S: EXT. THICK WOODS NEAR EAST LIVERPOOL, OHIO - A MAN - DAY
N: moves quickly through the woods. They run downhill. He wears expensive hunting clothes. He carries an 8mm Mauser sports rifle with a slim forestock and wrist and a turned-down bolt handle. It's the best rifle made in 1933. HE IS MELVIN PURVIS (30) cleancut and handsome. A square jaw. Chester Gould modelled Dick Tracy's profile after Purvis. Has not big, but he's tenacious. He's an incarnation of the social elite of h.is time: white, Southern patrician and a Christian gentleman. With Purvis are Special Agents WARREN BARTON (31) and Purvis's friend CARTER DAUM (29) They have a harder time in the steep woods. They're chasing someone. They are guided by East Liverpool police chief, FULTZ. BOTTOM OF THE HILL -- PRETTY BOY FLOYD ( 29) is a big-boned country boy. His blue suit is mud-streaked from his slide down the hill. He carries a Thompson submachine-gun with a drum magazine, and he is running for his life. PURV I S , FULTZ, BAUM + BARTON race after him. MUDDY PATH - FLOYD half runs, half slips in his dress shoes.

C: PURVIS
D: breaks into the clear.
C: PURVIS
D: Floyd! Halt! Purvis aims the Mauser. Perfect form. Floyd zigzags. Purvis FIRES, misses. Floyd opens up with the Thompson -- wildly at that range. A few .45s splinter nearby branches. Fultz, Baum and Barton seek cover: Purvis works the bolt and chambers another round. Floyd is 10 yards from the forest. Purvis kneels onto his right knee. On his upraised left knee he braces hi left elbow. He inhales. Starts a smooth squeeze. Ha Tway through the exhale he FIRES. Floyd's right arm flies up. He's punched forward and crashes to the ground.

S: INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - J. EDGAR HOOVER - DAY
C: MCKELLAR
D: Why do we need this?
E: to Hoover
C: HOOVER
D: Because of the new breed of mobile outlaws who flee jurisdiction by crossing state lines over highways and against whom this government must wage a war on crime. J. EDGAR HOOVER is a physically short man but has a dynamic presence. He is a dapper patrician who believes in elites. He is completely free from self-doubt. He is youthful and 33 years old. SUYDAM and TOLSON sit next to him. MCKELLAR iï¿½'Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Sub- Committee.-,He's an avuncular man of 62.
C: MCKELLAR
D: And so in the middle of a Great Depression you're looking for a budget increase to build up your Department? But by my tally your Department of Investigation spends more taxpayer's dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first place...
C: HOOVER
D: That's ridiculous. The Bureau's apprehended kidnappers, bank robbers, who have stolen up to...
C: MCKELLAR
D: How many criminals you apprehended?
E: looking at document
C: HOOVER
D: We've arrested and arraigned 213 wanted felons...

D: I've never arrested anybody.
N: MCKELLAR (INCREDULOUS) You never arrested anybody?
C: HOOVER
D: I'm an administrator.
C: MCKELLAR
D: With no field experience. For once Hoover is silent.
N: MCKELLAR (CONT'D) (CONTINUING) In fact you are shockingly unqualified, aren't you, sir? You have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life= Others in the room stare at Hoover. McKellar leans'-back... MCKELLAR (CONT Â° D ) (CONTINUING) I think you are a front. I think your prowess as a lawman is a myth created from a hoopla of headlines by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there. You are trying to make a federal police force with you set up as its Czar. That is runnin' wild in my estimation...
C: HOOVER
D: Crime is what runs wild in this country, Mr. Chairman. And...
C: MCKELLAR
D: And if the country required an expanded Bureau, I question you are the person most fit to run it while...
N: HOOVER (EXPLODES) I won't be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians...
C: MCKELLAR
D: While outlaws like Dillinger, Clyde Barrow, the Barkers, and Nelson flourish unabated.
E: slams gavel!

C: HOOVER
D: Find out: was he soft on the Reds in ,1919? Does he use prostitutes? Peppy `tuf f like that. And feed this to Walter =!riiâinchell: "McKellar's a Neanderthal. He's O7:a personal vendetta to destroy me." Like that.
E: to Suydam
N: (BEAT) We'll fight him on the front page. Not in his damn committee room... (to Tolson) Where's Dillinger?
C: TOLSON
D: Spotted in Hammond, Indiana.
C: HOOVER
D: How long ago?
C: TOLSON
D: Yesterday. Another sighting has him on the Lincoln Highway in Ohio heading towards Cincinnati.
N: HOOVER (DECIDES) He's in Hammond. Heading to Chicago.

C: HOOVER
D: Pretty Boy Floyd, for which you have my commendation and personal gratitude. Second, you are, as of this moment, the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago field office. Your task will be to get John Dillinger. Are you up to it?
C: PURVIS
D: Absolutely, sir. Purvis is imbued. Henry Suydam enters.
C: SUYDAM
D: They're ready for him.
E: to Hoover
N: HOOVER (PENSIVE) This is Henry Suydam.. He is our expert in congressional and press relations. INT. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION w HOOVER ESCORTS PURVIS THROUGH
C: THE OPEN PLAN OFFICE
D: Tolson + Suydam follow. It's like the "Corporate Office of the Future" designed by Albrecht Speer. Agents are at grey metal desks dressed identically in dark suits, white shirts, dark ties. No personal effects. The individual is reduced to a component in a gleaming machine.

C: TOLSON
D: hurry down the staircase.
N: HOOVER (LOW) Why are you sure you're up to this task, Mr. Purvis?

C: HOOVER
D: What are they?
C: PURVIS
D: The Bureau's modern techniques of investigation and your visionary leadership.
C: HOOVER
D: You let Mr. Tolson, here, know if you need anything, Melvin, anything at all,
C: PURVIS
D: Thank you.
C: HOOVER
D: Call me J.E. They shake hands. There's a mob of photographers and newsmen and microphones to interview him.
E: brilliant smile
C: EXTREMELY CLOSE: MELVIN PURVIS
D: is awed. He's imbued with purpose. He's been anointed Hoover's Crimebuster. He claimed he was up to the task. "Is he?" he asks himself right now. And he didn't expect to be overcome by doubt. He struggles with anxiety. Then, he pushes that aside and forces himself to take the step forward into the lights and flashbulbs.
C: SUYDAM
D: Our own Clark Gable...
E: quietly to Tolson

N: E/I. ARAGON BALLROOM, CHICAGO - ON DILLINGER - NIGHT watching a sexy young woman on the dance floor. He loses sight of her... He's expecting someone. Then, Dillinger sees her again: jet black hair in a bob, brown eyes, high cheekbones fom:her Indian mother and a great smile. She lights up a ro om. She is BILLIE FRECHETTE (27). She feels the stare and looks over. She studies him, then looks away. Dillinger's with Pierpont, Makley and Hamilton at a table. It is loaded with steaks, oysters, and frog legs. ALVIN KARPIS and Homer Van Meter approach and Alvin sits next to Johnnie... Dillinger adjusts his chair to watch for the girl. He's shoulder to shoulder to Karpis.
C: DILLINGER
D: Hiya, Alvin. You hungry? How's Freddie and Dock? (note: Alvin Karpis is cunning and careful. He will outlive everyone, including J. Edgar Hoover, and retire to Torremolinos, Spain, where he will die of heart failure in
N: Freddie and Dock Barker are the sons of Ma Barker. After the FBI gunned down the old woman, Hoover labeled her the "crime genius" of the family. According to Volney Davis, she couldn't organize breakfast.)

N: DILLINGER (SMILES) Sounds like Jesse James. KARPIS (LOW) A million seven, a million eight. Dillinger looks at Karpis. In 2007, that would be $22 million.

C: DILLINGER
D: Without women, I might as well have `stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.
C: HAMILTON
D: What's why they invented whores. Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his eye on Billie. Music ends. Young man escorts her to her table. He tries to join her. She turns him down. Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous. He gives her his best grin.
E: getting up
C: DILLINGER
D: I don't know what you said to your friend, but I sure am glad you did. Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something back.

She gets up and wanders around the room. He thinks she's the most beautiful creature he's ever seen. She's looking at his stuff. She sees suitcases that are packed, ready to leave in a heartbeat. Everything's so neat. She touches his folded shirt...

N: She turns over and puts her mouth next to his ear. It gets amorous through...
C: BILLIE
D: After my daddy died, we went to live on the reservation in Flandreau. In Flandreau nothin' ever happened.
N: (BEAT) When I was 13, we went to live with my Aunt Ines in Milwaukee where my cousin Frances had a lot of Indian friends who went around to churches and put on plays like "Little Fireface."

Hurt is in his late 30s. These men are ex-Texas Rangers. Unlike flashier Texan lawmen of the period, they do not wear Western wear unless they're on a horse.

D: It's been, three, four weeks. You'll look for a change. Or you'll get tired of me. And then I'll be sad and angry. So I wanted to say thank you before then... Dillinger is surprised that her expectations are so low. She didn't think his interest in her to be more than passing.
C: DILLINGER
D: You want to leave?
C: BILLIE

D: Homer and his damn joke... I don't want to be around to see any of that. Okay?! That's what it's about... Dillinger gets it.
C: DILLINGER
D: I am not going anywhere! I am going to die in your arms as an old man when that time comes. So what do you say about that?
C: CLOSE ON BILLIE
D: Now is the first time she allows herself to have any prospect about a future with him. It's a shock.
N: CONTINUED: ( 4) She hikes up her skirt and sits on his lap and smothers him with a kiss. Her hat falls off. Patrons nearby glance and look away. Dillinger doesn't give a damn. A new pack of dogs are about to take flight.
S: EXT. PHILLIPS GAS STATION - BILLIE WITH A CAMERA -- DAY
N: (ARIZONA) A fresh and tanned Dillinger and Billie are in a strikingly modern gas station on Route 66. Billie helps out a family by taking their picture with a Kodak Brownie in front of a Saguaro cactus. Snow-capped Rincon mountains are behind them. She leans down to play with the round baby.

We SEE Winstead and Hurt in their suits and ties are there, too. They lounge at ease. A Tucson Deputy gives them coffee. Eye contact with Dillinger. But Dillinger reacts to Purvis.
N: DILLINGER (BEAT) Well, the man who killed Pretty Boy Floyd. He might have been "Pretty," 'cause he sure was not "Whiz Kid Floyd." Deputies stifle laughter. Dillinger comes up close to Purvis. They are eyeball to eyeball. Only the bars separate them.

C: RED HAMILTON'S
D: front sight rests on Zarkovich's heart which he would blow out the back of his chest with the souped-up 351 Winchester. Now, Dillinger pulls the '34 Ford out of the backyard with Red still on the running board. Zarkovich almost faints in relief.

C: DILLINGER
D: Wanna know if we're armed? Were armed. He dumps this guy on his ass, his heavy shoe an ounce from crushing his larynx. Red's two Thompsons concealed on shoulder straps are out from under his coat. Frozen time. Phil D'Andrea sits on the corner of a table. Only he stays relaxed.

C: DILLINGER
D: I'll go in with you.
S: INT. 11TH AND STATE STREET STATION, LOBBY - DILLINGER
N: strolls into the police station like he owns the place. Polly chatters away. He doesn't hear her, We SEE what Johnny sees...
C: DILLINGER POV: REGISTRY
D: "Licenses Examination" is on the 8th Floor. "Detective Bureau" is on the 6th.
C: CU: DILLINGER

C: DILLINGER
D: How long will you be?
C: POLLY
D: It might take ten minutes.
C: DILLINGER
D: I'll meet you back here... He waits as she boards an elevator. As her doors close, Dillinger follows a group of police, bail bondsmen, and civilian workers into a second elevator.
S: INT. SIXTH FLOOR, LOBBY - ON DILLINGER
N: entering the "Detective Bureau" and we MOVE with him past desks and detectives in the open plan office. He walks with cocky assurance. Now he turns down an aisle between desks because he's spotted on one of the glass dividers a sign that exerts a magnetic pull on him. It designates the elite... "DILLINGER SQUAD" JOHN DILLINGER heads right for it.
C: ECU DILLINGER'S HAND
D: brushes under his jacket his .45, checking..
N: WIDE - JOHNNY enters this section of desks. Shafts of light illuminate papers. A DETECTIVE we may have seen at Midway Airport right past him... Wall charts, crime photos from Crown Point, the American Bank, other banks, Billie, mug shots of all his crew, are posted on walls. Photos of Dillinger are on desks. It's as if it was a shrine to him. IN A CORNER SIX OR SEVEN DETECTIVES listen to the ninth inning of a White Sox game. Three others work through reports in shirt sleeves. One glances his way. Johnny nods. Detective nods back.
C: JOHNNY
D: crosses thr4gh it all, strolls in the lion's den, walks in the belly ;ofthe beast - among the hunters. His audacity elevates h-,It is triumph. With all their resources, modern technology".`and organization, they cannot lay a glove on him. He is better than they are. His gratification is internal. He leaves behind, as he exits, a wake of absurdity. He passed through and they didn't even know. History was made. Like a ghost, has gone.
S: EXT. CHICAGO POLICE STATION - AUBURN - POLLY - DAY

S: EXT. BIOGRAPH - AGENT BROWN
N: puts down the pay phone. Mouths "not yet" to..
S: INT. CAR: VIS
N: down the street in a parked car. In the driver's seat is Reinecke. He's tense, trying to stay calm. On his upper lip sweat beads. Does he remember the words of Billie about what Dillinger would do to him?
C: CU: PURVIS
D: watches the crowds thin as showtime nears. He gets out of the car. Is Dillinger a no-show? Another failure? Another eviscerating memo from Hoover? THREE FIGURES BRUSH PAST HIM. A woman's orange skirt. Its Anna Sage, Polly Hamilton, and John Dillinger. They sweep to the ticket booth, pay, and join latecomers rushing inside so that they don't miss the start of the movie.
C: PURVIS
D: is stunned. Dillinger passed three feet from him.
S: INT. THEATER
N: It's packed. Anna Sage had to sit separately on the aisle some rows back. Johnny and Polly sit three rows from the screen."Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable, William Powell, and Myrna Loy begins.

S: INT. THEATER -- DILLINGER + POLLY
N: absorbed in the movie. ON SCREEN: District Attorney (William Powell) listens to his secretary. She is against her boss inviting gangster Blackie Gallagher (Clark Gable), his childhood friend, to his wedding...
C: SECRETARY
D: Remember what happened to that District Attorney in the Midwest. Just for having his picture taken with some gangster...?, The movie is referring to John Di.llinger's Crown Point photo session with his arm around Prosecutor Robert Estill.
C: DILLINGER
D: laughs out loud. The irony is that the gangster who inspired this Hollywood moment is sitting right here watching this movie.
S: EXT. BIOGRAPH - 19 BUREAU AGENTS + 5 EAST CHICAGO COPS
N: arrive and Purvis deploys them out. Except after Little Bohemia, he doesn't tell Winstead what to do... WINSTEAD (LOW) Clarence and I are going to be in that doorway. (MORE)

E: CONT'D
C: PURVIS
D: In case he walks north?
C: WINSTEAD
D: He ain't gonna head north. He's gonna walk south and cut through that alley back to her place. Gerry, when you spot him through your rearview-you come up on him from behind. The "cowboys" are the only men not deployed by Purvis. They call their own shots.
S: EXT. REAR ALLEY - THREE BUREAU AGENTS
N: take up positions near a rear exit. Another two go further down.

C: CHARLIE
D: Pretend like nothing's going on... He leaves the booth, taking the cash receipts.

S: EXT. BIOGRAPH ALLEY - AGENT SURAN
N: The alley suddenly is illuminated by headlights from two directions. A rear door opens and before the car stops, a CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE has stepped off the running board with his sawed-off shotgun in Agent Suran's face.
C: SURAN
D: Wait, wait...! Hold it! Federal Agent!
C: CHICAGO P.D. DRIVER/SGT.
D: Before you shoot him, get his I.D.

D: What do you think you're doing here?

D: Were on a federal stakeout! Put that gun down and back those cars out of the alley. But stay close because we may need you.

S: INT. BIOGRAPH - SCREEN: MYRNA LOY
C: MYRNA LOY
D: I love you more than anything, Blackie, you know...? She stops.
C: DILLINGER'S
D: mesmerized' her eyes and soft skin. We SEE in his hyper reality thee satin tones on the screen. Myrna Loy's insouciance,;like Billies, speaks to him. Meanwhile...
S: EXT. LINCOLN BOULEVARD - AGENT MCCARTHY + EAST CHICAGO COPS
N: SOPSIC + STRETCH empty their pockets, trying to identify themselves to TWO HUGE CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE who've drawn down on them. Zarkovich starts arguing, not believing this is happening. More Chicago PD arrive. Meanwhile...
S: INT. CAR - PURVIS
N: starts across the street to straighten out the Chicago P.D. Sergeant. While...

D: Don't drag it out.
E: CONT'D
N: GRAIN STRUCTURE OF THE FACE OF GABLE speaking these important words...
C: CLARK GABLE
D: .that doesn't count for anything. There's no more point to it.
E: CONT'D
C: CU: DILLINGER
D: He sees inwards. And he knows it won't happen. Them=E no Mexico with Billie. There's no freighter to Manila.- He will die. This day, this month, next month. He knows that in this instant.
N: JOHN DILLINGER. LOOKING UP AT THE SCREEN. In this Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and effect operates on the end, as inescapably as gravity. It's a core truth. This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher. And its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time be up. Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration slices time into component parts. Gable exchanges last good- byes. He warns his D.A. friend, Ronald Coleman, not to commute his sentence. The images play on Dillinger's face. They take him over-alone in the packed theater while 25 Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside. BLACKIE GALLAGHER
T: enters the execution chamber. CUT TO:
S: EXT. BIOGRAPH - PURVIS
N: glances at his watch. He rips a match from the matchbook, ready to light the cigar. The lobby is empty. The dim music of the finale leaks out.
S: EXT. DOORWAY - WINSTEAD + CLARENCE HURT
N: wait. Winstead coolly watches Purvis.
S: INT. CAR - REINECKE'S
N: right hand shakes. He can't control it. He grips the steering wheel to make it stop.
S: EXT. BAKERY STEPS - ZARKOVICH
N: ignores the Chicago detectives.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIOGRZPH - ANNA SAGE
N: looks at the backs of heads in the rows in front of her. She doesn't want to miss Dillinger if he leaves. A celiblock. The cellblock lights dim, a convict says...
C: CONVICT
D: There he goes. They're giving it to him now.
E: O.S.
C: CU: JOHN DILLINGER
D: The grin. End title music. People stirring. The house lights come up. Johnny doesn't move. He seems liberated. Released somehow. People in front and behind him start to exit. He sits there, holding onto his thoughts for a moment.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BIOGRAPH - PURVIS
N: anxiously scans faces emerging from the theater.
S: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BIOGRAPH - SPECIAL AGENTS
N: are alert in case Dillinger exits a rear door.
S: EXT. BIOGRAPH LOBBY - POLLY, THEN DILLINGER + ANNA
N: file out. Polly takes his arm. Anna is behind him and off to the side. They're in a loose knot of people.
C: PURVIS
D: sees him. He lights his cigar. It's the signal to move in.
N: ACROSS THE STREET: RICHMOND + ZARKOETICH don't see the signal because the Chicago P.D. detective is now shouting at Zarkovich.
C: PURVIS
D: lights a second match. And as he lights his cigar, he looks up to see...
C: JOHN DILLINGER
D: look right at him. BUT Dillinger does not recognize Purvis.
S: INT. CAR - REINECKE
N: saw the signal. He's out of his car. DILLINGER, POLLY + ANNA turn left at the sidewalk heading south, like Winst"ad said. They pass doorways. Reinecke approaches from 20 feet behind.
C: ACROSS THE STREET: ZARKOVICH
D: looks up... sees Dillinger walking away. If Dillinger's taken alive, he's dead. The Chicago cop puts a hand on Zarkovich`s chest...
N: REAR SHOT: POLLY, DILLINGER + ANNA SAGE down the sidewalk past shadowed doorways. WINSTEAD + HURT WINSTEAD (COOL) That's Dillinger. Straw hat. Glasses. Hurt crosses the sidewalk in front of Dillinger and walks north. He'll turn and position himself behind Dillinger on the right. These guys are pros. E.X.T. BAKERY STEPS - ZARKOVICH shoves the Chicago Sergeant out of his way and races across the street...
S: EXT. SIDEWALK - REINECKE
N: approaches Dillinger from the rear. He's 15 steps behind him. Purvis is ten steps behind Dillinger, on the left close to the wall. Now Purvis reaches for his gun.
C: ECU: REINECKE
D: draws his weapon. He stares at the back of Dillinger's head. Has getting closer. Sweat runs into Reinecke's eyes. This isn't the firing range with a paper target. This isn't theory. This is the beast. The beast is a gunfighter. The beast is better than you. You beat-up his girl. Your shot will miss...
C: DILLINGER IN LARGE PROFILE
D: now passerWinstead in the doorway. Purvis is raising his 9mm Browning. Reinecke stalls. He doesn't want to be first.
C: WINSTEAD
D: steps out f, the doorway, now, and falls in up the center of the sidewalk. Reinecke's eyes are riveted on Dillinger...
C: AND JOHN DILLINGER
D: senses something.
N: REAR SHOT: DILLINGER'S NECK + HEAD IN SLO-MOTION Subconsciously his brain processes what his peripheral vision took in that his intuitive defenses don't like about this landscape. He turns...
C: DILLINGER SEES REINECKE
D: Reinecke's hand holding the gun is frozen in the air. He's paralyzed. He lacks the power to pull the trigger.
C: DILLINGER'S EYES
D: There's the man who slammed Billie into that car. Dillinger's lethal intent focuses on this one target. In milliseconds...
N: DILLINGER DRAWS turning towards Reinecke. Reinecke has hijacked his attention. Dillinger hasn't picked up the others.
C: PURVIS
D: pulls the trigger. Nothing. He left the safety on. He fumbles with it.
C: PURVIS
D: H--halt!
C: DILLINGER
D: sees all of them RIGHT NOW. He pushes the .380 in SLOWED TIME towards Purvis.. .and bumps into a pedestrian named Ella Natasky.
C: ELLA NATASKY
D: starts to fall. Dillinger turns his attention to her for a millisecond. He's a gentleman. His impulse is to reach for her to steady her...
C: CHARLES WINSTEAD
D: shoves aside the paralyzed Reinecke, pushes past Purvis, leans forward and shoots John Dillinger in the back of the head. The heavy 45 round punches through Dillinger's,brain stem and exits underneath his right eye. John Dillinger stumbles into the alley opening and starts to fall. A second shot from Winstead and two more from Clarence Hurt hit him now. They don't matter.
C: JOHN DILLINGER
D: falls through the air.
N: EXTREMELY CLOSE ACROSS THE COBBLESTONES: JOHN DILLINGER'S
C: FACE
D: crashes into the FRAME. One lens of his eyeglasses breaks. The brim of his straw hat snaps. The hat falls away. He struggles, but can't move. He breathes. He tries to speak..
C: WINSTEAD
D: stands over him. Purvis snatches the .380 automatic out of Dillinger's hand.
C: .WINSTEAD
D: sees Dillinger's trying to say something.
N: CONTINUED:( 2)
C: JOHNNY'S LIPS
D: try to form speech and Winstead's ear is next to his mouth. We and Winstead hear...
C: DILLINGER
D: .tell Billie... Only Charles Winstead hears the rest.
C: PURVIS
D: unloads Dillinger's gun. His gun-handling of Dillinger's gun is a lot better than his gun-handling of his own under stress.
C: PURVIS
D: What did he say?
C: WINSTEAD
D: I couldn't hear him.
C: PURVIS
D: You look after this. I need to call Washington. Zarkovich`houlders through the gathering crowd of
C: PEDESTRIAN
D: s=and newsmen, sees the head wound, the glazing over of Diflinger's eyes. He knows he's safe.
C: JOHN DILLINGER'S EYES
D: get dreamy, then they seem to focus far away. Then they seem to focus not at all.
C: PURVIS
D: Cover his face and keep the damn photographers away.
E: CONT'D
C: AERIAL: LINCOLN AVENUE
D: Purvis starts away and we SEE the Biograph marquee, the trolley tracks in the cobblestone street, the alley, and the hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the dead John Dillinger.

S: EXT. CANAL STREET HOTEL - DOOR
N: opens. Alvin Karpis comes out. In the hot, humid New Orleans air, his suit coat is off...he carries it under his arm. He crosses the street towards his Lincoln Coupe. His eyes land on a man on a bench across the street looking at him over a newspaper. And while crossing the street, Alvin slows down. THE MAN IS CHARLES WINSTEAD The newspaper hides a sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever action shotgun. ALVIN LOOKS TO HIS LEFT: CLARENCE HURT leans on a lamp post. His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle.

Karpis' eyes dart to the roofto isÂ°. Snipers on both. In this instant, Karpis knows he is done. One objective races into his mind: stay alive.
C: KARPIS'
D: stretches out his arms, wide. Winstead has dropped the newspaper. The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at Alvin's chest. Karpis is displaying he is unarmed. Winstead approaches warily step-by-step. His weapon would cut Alvin in half. Clarence, the rifle at his shoulder, inches forward. The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters with real trigger-time have taken Alvin Karpis.
C: ALVIN KARPIS
D: I am unarmed.
C: WINSTEAD
D: Don't even breathe sudden.
N: WINSTEAD Â± CAMPBELL + HURT are 10 feet from him. Clarence pats him down. Karpis is clean. The Texans cover Alvin and move him to the sidewalk near his car.

D: One thing I learned was that John Dillinger was an outlaw and my Adversary. But he was no punk. And he was no hoodlum.

E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) " .tell Billie for me...Bye Bye Blackbird..." Billie has to rise and turn away from Winstead so that he doesn't see her overcome with emotion. Winstead knows this. It is the measure of this man that he respected the privacy of John Dillinger's message and only told her. THE END
