Another table has been set up; this one near the seated Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin.

S: INT. PRISON - VISITING BUNGALOW - DAY
N: DOC IS SEATED... WAITING. CAROL enters the darkened room and seats herself opposite Doc. They are separated by a wide table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid- point between them.
C: CAROL
D: Hello, Doc.

N: CAROL ENTERS A LEGAL OFFICE, WEARING A SOFT BILLOWY dress. She looks very good. A middle aged SECRETARY looks up at Carol. A short balding man (THE ACCOUNTANT) in his forties works at a large desk across the room from the Secretary. He seems totally occupied with his bookwork. NEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORT They are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be anything at all but all three have commonality; they are professionals. HAYHOE - Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter ender. CULLY - Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop out of his buttoned shirtsleeves... SWAIN - a little older and a little smarter than the other two, his narrow features allow no warmth. AFTER A MOMENT: SECRETARY Yes?

C: CAROL
D: Yes, I think you can.
N: A MAN'S FINGERS STARING AT THE ANKLET ON THE WOMAN'S LEG then drawing an imaginary line upward... a woman's hand wearing a wedding ring comes up to meet it.
S: INT. SANDERSON PRISON OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY
N: A UNIFORMED GUARD LEADS DOC DOWN THE HALLWAY, they turn a corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed in civilian clothes. Doc catches sight of himself in a small mirror. He stops looking uncertainly at the image... and then moves on with the guard.
S: EXT. PRISON - DAY
N: DOC EXITS THE PRISON AND STANDS WAITING NEAR THE AUTO GATE. He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the edge of the penitentiary... Doc turns, looks again at the prison... four years is a long time. A dark Caddy is parked down the road.
S: INT. CADDY - DAY
N: THE ACCOUNTANT OR SWAIN SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL. He stares at Doc. Doc crosses to him.

N: He gestures and drives away.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: DOC IS STILL WAITING He leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance way... The duffel bag rests beside him. A late model Ford approaches, stops near Doc... the passenger side door opens from the inside... Carol is driving... Doc and Carol look at one another, their eyes holding several moments.
S: INT. FORD - DAY
N: BOTH CAROL AND DOC ARE VERY TENSE.
C: CAROL
D: Hello, Doc.
C: DOC
D: Hi.
C: CAROL
D: You okay?
C: DOC
D: I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
E: big smile
N: They look at each other for a moment. Carol leans forward... Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses her lightly, but with affection...
C: CAROL

C: CAROL
D: Feel good?
C: DOC

YOUNG BOYS SWING ON A ROPE THAT HANGS OVER THE PALLS COLLEGE KIDS, SOME ARE SWIMMING, SOME STUDYING, SOME just grooving. AN OLDER COUPLE SIT ON THE BANK, THEIR FEET IN THE WATER CAROL SITS DOWN NOT TOO CLOSE. DOC IS SILENT FOR LONG moments. Carol starts to speak but doesn't. He is preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts. Finally he stands, looking down at her. He slowly takes off his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and starts walking towards a tree. Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives for the rope. CAROL IS ALREADY ON HER FEET, HER SWEATER OFF, SHOES kicked aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward splash. She is a brief second behind him. THEY COME UP TOGETHER, AND HE LAUGHS WITH THE PURE JOY of being free and alive. She joins him, in his laughter and with their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept down stream.
S: INT. EL OSO CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW A PORTION OF THE EXTERIOR BUILDING CAN
N: BE SEEN... The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived here almost two years. On the wall there is a poster (which will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now on). Around the room are drying clothes. Carol is ironing with a steam iron. Doc is sitting at a table with a Colt .45 in front of him and a .32 automatic. He is field stripping. There is a bowl of peaches on the table.
C: DOC
D: It doesn't look like that.
E: pointing to the poster
C: CAROL
D: What do you mean? You've never been there.
C: DOC
D: I've been there every day for the last four years.

C: CAROL

D: Just the way I remembered.
N: Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently.
C: DOC
D: You been okay?
E: CONT'D
C: CAROL
D: Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
C: DOC
D: How's Estelle?
C: CAROL
D: Fatter... some things never change.
C: DOC
D: Boring.
C: CAROL
D: Nothing's been boring since you found me.
C: DOC
D: That's not all of it.
E: carefully
C: CAROL
D: No. It's been a long time.
N: A pause. He continues stroking her arm.
C: DOC
D: You go out much?
C: CAROL
D: After four years and now the question comes up.
C: DOC
D: Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
C: CAROL
D: I'm still here, Doc.
E: with warmth and a smile
N: He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward the stairs.
S: INT. BEDROOM
N: THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she stares vacantly expectant. Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping Doc drop the garment down to her waist. Doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder... her hair... he kisses her... Doc gently eases himself away from Carol.
C: DOC
D: Oh Christ...
E: he is very tight
N: He again moves close... Doc reaches around to unsnap her bra as Carol places both of her arms around him, holding him tightly... Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains unyielding... He closes his eyes for a second... The pressure of the moment is again too intense for Doc. Once more he pulls gently away from her. Carol looks at him, her eyes very reassuring.
C: DOC
D: I guess I'm kind of...
E: CONT'D continuing
C: CAROL
D: It's all right.
C: DOC
D: It's just been a while.
E: explaining the obvious
C: CAROL
D: We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
N: She stands, begins to remove her skirt.
C: DOC
D: Wait... give me a minute.
C: CAROL
D: Sure.
N: She sits beside him again, takes his hand in hers...
C: DOC
D: I'll be okay.
C: CAROL
D: Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
C: DOC
D: Really?
C: CAROL
D: Really.
N: They look at one another. A pause. He kisses her; their embrace pulls them back across the bed.
C: CAROL
D: Let me make you feel good, Doctor.
E: CONT'D continuing
N: But she has little chance as he begins to make love to her.

N: She exits and returns with some clothes. He looks at them.
C: DOC
D: Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
C: CAROL
D: Suit yourself.
N: They start eating.
C: DOC
D: How much does Beynon get?
N: A pause. Carol looks directly at Doc.
C: CAROL
D: $250,000 right off the top.
C: DOC
D: Is he straight?
C: CAROL
D: You got the parole, didn't you?
N: He picks up a fork and looks through it, as if it is prison bars. She takes his hand and gently takes the fork from him.
C: DOC
D: Thanks again. I 'm glad you waited.
E: then
C: CAROL
D: I couldn't have... much longer.
E: simply
C: DOC
D: Yeah... I know.
C: CAROL
D: But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
N: Carol begins to laugh softly.
C: DOC
D: Why are you laughing?
C: CAROL
D: I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
C: DOC
D: That doesn't hurt.
C: CAROL
D: But sometimes I cried a lot too.
C: DOC
D: I didn't. I just waited.
E: trying to smile
C: CAROL
D: Want to cry now?

C: DOC
D: I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
E: sarcastic
C: BEYNON
D: This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...

N: SWEEP SECOND HAND TURNING 8:35. DOC'S HANDS - SETTING A BOMB-TIMING MECHANISM ATTACHED TO TWO STICKS of dynamite, two tubes of Naptha, a lot of prima cord and one small, dark percussion cap. CAROL SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE GREY PANEL TRUCK as it prowls smoothly down a brush-lined Central Texas road. Carol drives calmly, professionally...
C: ANGLES
D: DOC IS BEHIND CAROL, AT THE BACK OF THE VAN. He wears a jacket and watch cap. Doc is squatted down, quickly activating another timing mechanism, checking the clock-face on the bomb against his wristwatch... with a quick, dexterous movement, he places a bomb into the two large grocery bags at his feet. After burying the explosives within each sack, he covers the bombs with crumpled wastepaper.
E: MORE
C: ANGLES
D: The grocery bags are then gently shoved forward, resting against the wheel well of the truck.
E: CONT'D
N: As Doc looks at Carol...
S: INT. A '65 BUICK - RUDY
N: PARKED ALONG A SECLUDED PATHWAY, facing the highway which lies a quarter of a mile away. He has on a trench coat buttoned to the neck and his sailor's watch cap... he stares at the highway. THE PANEL TRUCK SLIDES BY...

N: RUDY CHECKS HIS PISTOL. He shoves the pistol into the side pocket of his raincoat. Rudy starts the engine... then slides the car into gear...
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - BEACON CITY, TEXAS - DAY
N: A sleepy, traditional municipality... A DAPPER GENTLEMAN IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES WALKS ALONG THE SIDEWALK. He is the PRESIDENT of the First Bank of Beacon City -- nodding to a few passersby, he stops at the front door of the bank, knocks twice. A BANK GUARD opens the door and the Bank President moves inside. VISIBLE ON THE GLASS DOOR sign that reads: FIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY Founded 1911 Hours: 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM Weekdays Only
S: INT. THE BANK
N: THE PRESIDENT SNAPS ON A BANK OF IRRIDESCENT LIGHTS. Several TELLERS have begun setting up for the day's commerce...
S: INT. PANEL TRUCK
N: DOC SHIFTS HIS POSITION SLIGHTLY, THEN PULLS HIS .45 OUT from beneath his jacket. Doc breaks out the clip, examines it, snaps it back to position. He replaces the gun under his jacket -- the gesture seemingly more a mannerism than a precaution. A huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the floor of the truck near Doc, along with a black leather suitcase. CAROL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, Beacon City appears on the horizon through the windshield...
S: INT. BANK
N: THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TURNING THE COMBINATION on the massive door as the vault begins to open... RUDY - IN THE BUICK - DRIVING DOWN THE ROADWAY near the outskirts of town. A Texas Highway Patrol car passes, moving in the opposite direction... JACKSON - IN THE HAY TRUCK - PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES, then checks his watch. A WATCH FACE SHOWS THE TIME AT 8:56. THE WATCH BELONGS TO DOC. He looks expectantly towards Carol. THE PANEL TRUCK is now within the commercial district of Beacon City. Rudy's Buick is visible a hundred yards behind. THE HAY TRUCK drives off Main Street and into an open field near a corner of the town. Jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to the sidewalk. Rudy's Buick pulls over and Jackson gets into the passenger seat. The Buick then cruises back out onto Main Street... CAROL - IN THE VAN - APPROACHES AN INTERSECTION. Through the truck's window a traffic signal appears. RUDY PULLS THE BUICK OFF THE MAIN DRAG and onto a side street. Another turn and he again moves parallel to the Main Street...
S: INT. BANK
N: THE BANK PRESIDENT LEAVES THE VAULT, allowing the heavy door to stand open. A LATTICE-WORK BARRIER made of wrought-iron is pulled across the vault opening... the Bank President snaps the latch-lock closed. CAROL - IN THE PANEL TRUCK. She pulls the van carefully to a stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red... She turns her eyes back to Doc... DOC, CATCHES HER LOOK, then instantly springs into action. He reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of the truck, revealing the road below... a portion of a manhole cover is visible.
C: DOC
D: Two feet forward...
E: barking the words
N: CAROL ROLLS THE TRUCK SLIGHTLY FORWARD ON THE STREET - SEVERAL CARS can be seen moving up behind the panel truck. DOC GRABS THE TONGS, inserts the ends into the manhole cover notches. He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover forward. Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him. As he disappears from sight... RUDY DRIVING ON THE SIDE AVENUE, still moving parallel to Main Street. The Buick is now geographically well forward of the panel truck. Jackson stares at his watch.
C: JACKSON
D: Now!
N: Rudy makes a sharp left. The car accelerates, its wheels begin to quietly whine. Main Street comes back into view... CAROL WATCHING THE SIGNAL... still red... A MAN IN A PONTIAC eases to a stop behind the panel truck. He watches the signal. DOC STANDING IN THE SEWER PIPE. He turns on a flashlight, moves ahead. His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky water. Doc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines that run along the sewer wall... He moves down the dark oval corridor...
S: EXT. THE BANK
N: THE GUARD OPENS THE FRONT DOOR, allowing the morning PATRONS to enter.
S: INT. THE BANK
N: THE PRESIDENT SMILES UPON SEEING THE CUSTOMERS. He looks over to the wood-frame clock on the far wall. THE CLOCK READS 9:00 EXACTLY RUDY - IN THE BUICK - MAKES ANOTHER LEFT TURN, now back onto Main Street. THE BANK APPEARS A HALF-BLOCK AWAY through the car window. Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces; the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a disparity between their features... MAIN STREET - THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL has now blinked to green. CAROL IS GRINDING AWAY AT THE DEAD ENGINE of the panel truck... THE MAN IN THE PONTIAC leans on his HORN... other cars behind him begin to HONK. CAROL LEANS OUT OF THE CAB OF THE PANEL TRUCK and gestures for the cars to pass her. She again GRINDS away at the engine. DOC'S WATCH - SHOWING 9:01. DOC STANDS AT A MASSIVE CONNECTING BOX where four 112 strands of the conduit intersect. He puts the wire cutters to the first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a crunching POP, he cuts through the conduit with one bite. Doc immediately starts on the next strand. CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine. THE BUICK SLAMS TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE BANK. Rudy Il4 and Jackson pull open the car doors. DOC CUTTING THE LAST AND LARGEST CONDUIT.
S: INT. THE BANK
N: THE BANK GUARD is placing a local high school basketball schedule and display into position. SEVERAL PATRONS have formed small lines and are transacting business with the Tellers. The wall clock shows the time at 9:02. RUDY AND JACKSON BURST THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR. They stand shoulder to shoulder, guns extended the full length of their arms. Beneath the mask Rudy's smile is visible. THE BANK GUARD LOOKS UP PROM THE BASKETBALL DISPLAY. His eyes widen... both guns are leveled directly at him... simultaneously the lights go out... THE BANK PRESIDENT DESPERATELY PUSHES THE ALARM BUTTON near his desk. (INSERT: Button and bell.) Nothing happens. CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.
S: INT. A DENTIST'S OFFICE
N: THE D.D.S. TORTURES A BALDING PATIENT with a drill. The PATIENT groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain. When the power goes, the Dentist quizzically raises the drill and examines it. The Patient pants in relief.
C: DENTIST
D: Superior technology, my ass.
N: AN ELECTRIC WEATHER/TIME INDICATOR - above the town square... as the bulbs dim... DOC RUNNING DOWN THE SEWER; stopping at the manhole he scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire cutters up into the truck parked over him. CAROL - IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT - again she tries to start the engine. DOC PULLING HIMSELF BACK UP INTO THE VAN with a gymnastic thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs. CAROL - the engine still won't start. DOC DROPS THE HATCH DOOR back down into place on the floor of the truck...
C: DOC
D: Okay.
E: snapping his look to Carol
N: CAROL TURNS THE IGNITION SWITCH BACK ON... CAROL - AS THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE she engages the gearshift. The truck begins to move forward. Suddenly, the motor does STALL. DOC'S PACE TIGHTENS. The cars behind the van continue HONKING. CAROL - AGAIN GRINDING AWAY AT THE ENGINE. Her lips are compressed into a thin line... After a moment... the motor catches, the truck again moves forward. DOC PICKS UP THE LARGE BLACK SUITCASE from the floor of the panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and Carol. THE PANEL TRUCK WHIPS OFF MAIN STREET and onto a side avenue. Carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop. DOC IS NOW IN THE FRONT SEAT BESIDE CAROL. He pulls the truck door open, then hesitates. He touches her arm, their eyes meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment. Doc gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck. ON THE SIDEWALK DOC TURNS AND BEGINS WALKING toward an open alleyway. Behind him the panel truck pulls smoothly away. WALKING UP THE ALLEY - DOC PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES. He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley. The alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite end is bounded by a large brick building. Doc removes his pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along the side of the brick building. At the last moment he pulls down the watch cap mask.
S: INT. BANK
N: RUDY DISENGAGES THE LATCH on the side door.
S: EXT. ALLEY
N: DOC KICKS THE DOOR OPEN with a violent jerk of his leg.
S: INT. THE BANK
N: RUDY'S GUN IS TRAINED PROM THE BACK OF THE BUILDING over the Tellers and Patrons, spread-eagled across the floor. Their heads are down; several of them are trembling. DOC STANDS HOLDING THE .45 IN ONE HAND, suitcase in the other. He moves into the building, shutting the door behind him. RUDY IS NOW STATIONED NEAR THE FRONT DOOR, ready to intercept any incoming bank patrons -- he covers the room from the end opposite Jackson. Rudy stands near the Bank Guard's outstretched right hand -- The Guard's head is bloodied from Rudy's pistol whipping. His gun has been kicked against the wall. A short distance away Rudy is watching. THE BANK PRESIDENT lies face down on the floor, directly under the arc of Jackson's gun... who is continually turning to watch the Guard. DOC QUICKLY CROSSES THE DISTANCE between the side door and the vault, passing the Bank President. He slips the .45 into his jacket side pocket, sets down the suitcase, then either cuts the lock or picks it.
C: RUDY
D: 19 seconds.
E: looking at his watch
N: CAROL - IN THE VAN - She has stopped the panel truck near the deserted lot where the hay truck is parked. She drops the bomb-laden grocery bag inside the truckbed. She moves back towards the van... IN THE BANK DOC FINISHES,, RIPS THE DOOR OPEN, lifts the suitcase and moves into the vault. RUDY LOOKS AT THE BLOODIED GUARD, notes the distance separating the man from his gun. Though unconscious, the Guard's head begins to move. JACKSON HOLDS HIS GUN HAND FULLY EXTENDED. Again he takes a brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and at the Guard. ANGLES AND INSERTS - THE VAULT is lined with safety deposit boxes and large cabinet drawers. A metal table stands off-center, the black suitcase resting on its surface. Doc opens the satchel. He then pulls open one of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money pads into the open suitcase. THE BANK PRESIDENT LIES NEAR THE OPEN VAULT. He listens to the SOUNDS of Doc at work. He slightly cranes his neck, trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault. RUDY WATCHING THE FRONT DOOR. A PATRON enters; Rudy gestures with the gun... she hits the deck. JACKSON IS GETTING MORE NERVOUS by the minute... DOC continues working within the vault. THE WOMAN, now on the floor, quietly crying. JACKSON watching the Guard. RUDY watching Jackson. Calling out time. THE BANK GUARD, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is ready for one more round. THE BANK PRESIDENT in his prone position. He looks at Jackson, then to the vault. THE PANEL TRUCK - now at the other end of Main Street. CAROL EXITS THE VAN, carries the second sack to a large rubbish bin in front of an empty store. She deposits the grocery bag... DOC WORKING. The suitcase is now filled. He snaps the fasteners shut . DOC EXITS THE VAULT after withdrawing his .45 from his coat pocket . JACKSON SEES DOC LEAVE THE VAULT. He edges around the side of the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank.
S: DOC MOVES TOWARDS JACKSON'S OLD VANTAGE POINT NEAR THE SIDE
N: DOOR. He passes the bank president. RUDY NOW WATCHES DOC DOC CARRIES THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN HIS LEFT HAND. He gestures to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the side door. JACKSON HALF RUNS PASSING RUDY ON HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard. THE BANK GUARD STILL PUNCH DRUNK PULLS HIMSELF UP TO HIS HANDS and knees... the Guard looks at his pistol. DOC STOPS AT THE KICKED IN SIDE DOOR. HE COVERS THE ENTIRE bank with his gun. THE BANK GUARD BEGINS TO CRAWL WITH AGONIZING SLOWNESS towards his pistol. RUDY EYES STILL ON DOC JACKSON NOW AT THE FRONT DOOR IS PARALYZED WATCHING THE GUARD. DOC GESTURES TO RUDY AND JACKSON TO GET MOVING.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: CAROL PARKS THE VAN, CROSSES TO A FORD, GETS IN, DRIVES AWAY.
S: INT. BANK
N: THE GUARD HAS MORE THAN HALF CLOSED THE DISTANCE TO THE .38. JACKSON LEVELS HIS .44. DOC AND RUDY. BOTH SEE WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
C: DOC
D: Just pick it up.
E: shouts
C: RUDY
D: Don't!
N: JACKSON PULLS THE TRIGGER THREE TIMES. THE BANK GUARD'S BODY turns end-over-end from Jackson's bullets. Some of the bank Patrons SCREAM, others SOB with fright. DOC - His eyes are furious. RUDY AND JACKSON - Rudy shoves Jackson out the front door. DOC COVERS THEIR EXIT, then slips out the side door and into the alley.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET
N: RUDY GUNS THE BUICK FORWARD, the wheels tearing at the asphalt. Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car accelerates.
C: THE ALLEY
D: DOC, GUN AND SUITCASE IN HAND, nears the end of the alleyway.
N: CAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway opening. DOC TOSSES THE SUITCASE into the back of the car... then slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel as Carol slides over to the passenger seat.
S: INT. THE FORD
N: DOC PULLS OFF THE WATCH CAP MASK; his face taut. THE FORD SMOKES OFF as Doc kicks it into gear... MAIN STREET BEACON CITY A SERIES OF ANGLES THE BUICK STREAKS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROADWAY... Two bombs detonate into fireballs... The Hay truck blazes upward, bales instantly igniting. The grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange- flame inferno... Traffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk at the twin blazes. RUDY ZIG ZAGS THE BUICK ALONG. Maneuvering through the stopped traffic. DOC SLIDES THE FORD THROUGH A RIGHT AND LEFT TURN, emerging onto smoke-covered Main Street. The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the grass of a small park.
S: INT. FORD '
N: DOC LOOKS MORE THAN A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AS CAROL STARES AT him. POLICE CARS ROAR BY THEM.
S: EXT. SMALL PARK
N: DOC ZIPS THE CAR OFF THE GRASS AND BACK ONTO THE TRAFFIC CLOGGED ROADWAY. RUDY DRIVING THROUGH THE BEDLAM. Suddenly a gun appears in his right hand, aimed at Jackson. The pistol roars bucks, roars, bucks again. Jackson is shot through the head twice. THE FORD IS SEVERAL BLOCKS BEHIND RUDY. DOC DOWNSHIFTS avoiding stalled cars. Carol grasps at both the seat and the dashboard handholds to maintain her balance. THE BUICK EMERGES THROUGH DENSE PLUMES OF SMOKE. Fire licks along the one edge of the sidewalk. RUDY IN THE BUICK HAS NOW ALMOST CLEARED THE TOWN. He tears along the highway... sweating a little but becoming cool. He is a pro. His watch cap is now removed. ON THE CURVE - Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile and bounces across the pavement. DOC IN THE FORD POWERS ALONG. He approaches the flaming building, then hits the brakes as ... A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street . DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four wheel drift. Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars, through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign, then bores back onto the road. RUDY IN THE BUICK STROKING ALONG THE OPEN HIGHWAY. Looks in the rear view mirror. RUDY'S POV - THROUGH THE BUICK'S REAR WINDOW, BLACK smoke is visible billowing skyward. DOC AND CAROL IN THE FORD NOW DRIVING CALMLY THROUGH the countryside. A police car with light turning and siren wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon City. Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears from sight. THE BUICK - SERIES OF ANGLES - IT pulls off the highway and bumps down a dirt road. Rudy strains to hold the big car on the rutted pathway. The dirt road becomes a lane. A farm house and barn appear at a clearing. Rudy powers the car up a fairly steep hill, the crest of which is occupied by a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn. RUDY JUMPS OUT OF THE BUICK, trots to the front of the barn and pulls the double-doors open. A station wagon with wooden- panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within... THE FORD SWEEPS OFF THE HIGHWAY and onto the dirt road. WITHIN THE FORD - DOC IS DRIVING. Carol peels off her sweater. She has worn a faded blouse underneath... She pulls a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance. RUDY - IN THE BARN - The Buick is now parked near the Station Wagon. Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun, then moves towards the large doors of the barn. CAROL - IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE FORD - she watches as Doc drives up the lane... RUDY stands outside the barn as the car approaches. DOC STUDIES RUDY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, watching him wipe his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer...
S: INT. BARN
N: DOC PULLS THE FORD TO A STOP just within the double doors. He passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway station wagon. DOC JUMPS OUT OF THE FORD AS SOON AS the ignition switch is cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side. Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors. He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks around him. Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy. He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase, not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained a great weight.
C: DOC
D: Where's Jackson?
E: speaking over his shoulder, not looking at Rudy
N: Rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat.
C: RUDY
D: He didn't make it, Doc... you didn't either.
E: pointing his gun lazily at Doc, supremely confident
N: Doc straightens, still holding the suitcase. He starts to turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless. Carol fumbles for the gun in her purse. Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. Doc swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face Rudy's bullets... then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the chest, Doc's .45 slug driving him backward. Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. He drops the suitcase with his first shot, FIRES again, blasting Rudy in the middle. Two large holes now show at the chest of Rudy's raincoat. Rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the precipice and into a grassy meadow below. Doc stands at the crest of the hill. He looks down as Rudy's body stops turning. Doc shifts the .45 to his right hand. Rudy's body lies still. DOC TURNS QUICKLY AWAY PROM THE HILLTOP, not giving Rudy's body a second glance. Carol, gun in hand, stands outside the barn, transfixed.
C: CAROL
D: How did you know?
N: Doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car... the getaway car... as she starts to change clothes... he reloads. Doc takes a long look at Carol. THEY GET IN THE CAR AND LEAVE.
S: EXT. BOTTOM OP HILL - DAY
N: CAROL IS DRIVING., tooling comfortably along a country road. Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat. After several moments of silence:
C: CAROL
D: What about the bank?
C: DOC
D: Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
E: after a moment
N: Carol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side window.
C: CAROL
D: Oh, Christ.
N: Doc leans forward., snaps on the radio.
S: EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY
N: RUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs, along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch.
S: EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY
N: RUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone. RUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash the purling water across his face and then he laughs.
S: INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
N: DIALOGUE COMES ON THE RADIO DESCRIBING THE ROBBERY. $750,000 stolen.
C: DOC
D: We got between four and five.
N: Carol starts to open the bag and count. Doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. Doc reflectively studies the roadside ahead. They are heading along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that carries only a sparse amount of traffic. Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead.
C: CAROL
D: Doc...
E: now noticing the road
C: DOC
D: I see it...
E: flat
N: ON THE ROAD AHEAD HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE FORMED a traffic barricade. Several cars and trucks are being waved through the check-point. Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing vehicle. DOC ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITHOUT CHANGING EXPRESSION He slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line of slowly-passing vehicles. She turns, starts to reach into the back. Doc gently catches her arm, preventing her from moving further.
C: DOC
D: They're looking for three men... remember?
E: CONT'D
N: A YOUNG OFFICER looks into the cab of the pickup, then glances at the empty flatbed. Another PATROLMAN flanks the other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. Several Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional OFFICERS, are parked nearby. The pickup truck is waved through. The station wagon rolls up to the check-point. DOC ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW. He smiles and nods to the Young Patrolman.
C: DOC
D: What's the problem?
E: CONT'D big smile
N: CAROL STUDIES THE OFFICER on her side of the car through the closed window... the Officer peers back at her then into the rear seat. THE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock... After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio.
S: EXT. THE FARM - RUDY - DAY
N: Inside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face. He starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a ROAR. The panel truck leaps crazily forward, careening across the barn floor, SMASHING through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts out into the sunlight.
S: EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY
N: The station wagon rolls down the main street and stops near an outdoor phone booth at a filling station.

D: I don't want to go there.
C: DOC
D: Do it my way.
N: The wagon continues moving down the road.
S: EXT. A NARROW DIRT ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON
N: TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET. A CHILL SOUTHWEST WIND is blowing. The station wagon appears, moving slowly down the roadway, bouncing along its rutted surface. AT A SMALL INTERSECTION TWO MAIL BOXES STAND CLOSE to one another. The name Beynon is printed in black paint on one of the letter bins. Doc stops the wagon momentarily, looks at the box, then turns down the indicated road.
S: EXT. THE STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON
N: THE STATION WAGON clears the crest of a sage brush hill and passes camera.
S: INT. STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON
N: DOC PARKS THE WAGON UNDER A GNARLED COTTONWOOD TREE in front of the house. As he shuts off the engine, he pulls the .45 out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband. Carol watches the gesture. Doc starts to open the car door, then hesitates.
C: DOC
D: You can wait here... I'll wrap it up fast.
N: DOC STEPS OUT OF THE WAGON, then pulls the leather suitcase out of the back. He quietly shuts the car door and moves around the side of the house, toward the barn/garage at the rear. HE LOOKS CAREFULLY around the area, his eyes searching for signs of Beynon's men. Nothing seemingly amiss, he moves toward the front door, tries it, moves away. Doc crosses to the back screen door of the house. After another moment, Doc quietly opens the screen door and enters the house.
S: INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: DOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the kitchen.
S: INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT
N: BEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking the sour mash straight with a water chaser. DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes a sip.

D: No way. I always do my own work.
N: Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's glass.
C: BEYNON
D: Here. I understand the way you feel. As a matter of fact, you and I might share a great many feelings...
N: Beynon drinks from his glass. Doc continues counting the money.
C: DOC
D: I'm in a hurry.
E: snaps the words
C: BEYNON
D: You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
C: DOC
D: No applause!
N: Beynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair, stands beside the table.
C: BEYNON
D: Let's examine the situation. One, an extremely attractive woman. Then, there's the woman's husband, a skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison. Three, a man with political influence, a man who can easily get a parole for a convict... why should he?
N: Beynon sips his glass slowly. Doc's hand edges down toward his waist band.
C: BEYNON
D: A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
E: CONT'D continuing
C: DOC
D: I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
C: BEYNON
D: What do you add up to here?
E: cautiously
C: DOC
D: One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
C: BEYNON
D: A little more was taken out before. My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
E: a beat
C: DOC
D: So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
C: BEYNON
D: The obvious. But we are both not interested in that right now.
E: smiles., nodding as his smile fades
C: DOC
D: No. My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
E: a long beat
C: BEYNON
D: Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
C: DOC
D: I bet.
N: Doc senses a movement from the shadows behind Beynon. Turning his head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance to the kitchen. She holds a .32 automatic... the pistol seems to be pointed directly at Doc.
C: BEYNON
D: You wouldn't have come here when you were eight3 Mr. McCoy.
N: As the gun continues to be pointed directly at Doc.
C: BEYNON
D: Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
E: CONT'D continuing
C: DOC
D: Get it over with...
E: riding over Beynon's words
N: CAROL FIRES the automatic. The big gun belches the full slip in a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an ejected position. BEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud, the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore slugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned table. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it clattering and spinning away across the floor. DOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns, moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at her. CAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks. DOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen toward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight, only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.
S: INT. PANEL TRUCK - DUSK
N: Rudy is driving along an open highway. Rudy mouths inane lyrics to the radio, one arm on the wheel, the other clutching his wound. A small sign near a mailbox catches Rudy's eye. He swings the panel truck around in a U-turn, then pulls into the long dirt driveway of an isolated farm house. THE SIGN READS HAROLD CLINTON, D.V.M. Practice of Veterinary Medicine.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. DESERTED HIGHWAY - DUSK
N: THE STATION WAGON IS PARKED ALONG THE CEMENT ROAD, standing in isolation against the vast Texas b.g. Doc stands away from the car, his back turned to it ... gazing at the horizon. Carol is in the wagon but the passenger side door is open, her legs dangle outside the car as she looks steadily at the ground. Doc suddenly turns, walks to her and gives her a stinging slap across the face.
C: DOC
D: Stupid.
N: Tears begin to roll down Carol's face.
C: DOC
D: Why didn't you tell me?
E: CONT'D continuing
C: CAROL
D: There wasn't any way to explain it.
C: DOC
D: Yeah.
C: CAROL
D: You sent me to him.
C: DOC
D: When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
C: CAROL
D: What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
C: DOC
D: Who's she?
C: CAROL
D: She's on TV.
C: DOC
D: If you don't start telling the truth...
E: breaks off
C: CAROL
D: What do we do?
C: DOC
D: We keep going.
E: quietly
S: INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Swain sleeps on the davenport. Cully and Hayhoe sit at two sides of Beynon's large desk, playing a game of checkers... Hayhoe seems to have Cully badly beaten ... The Accountant enters the room. The block on the wall shows eight o'clock straight up.
C: ACCOUNTANT
D: Let's go.
N: The two men abandon their game. Cully kicks the sofa, awakening Swain. He groggily gets to his feet.
S: INT. MULTI-STORIED AUTO PARK - SAN ANTONIO - DAY
N: The station wagon enters the building. Doc takes a bright orange ticket from an ATTENDANT behind a glass window, then accelerates the wagon up a rampway leading to the upper levels of the building.
C: DOC
D: checks his watch momentarily as he prowls the wagon between long rows of automobiles.
N: THE STATION WAGON'S TIRES WHINE through a sweeping turn within the auto park's uppermost level -- through the building's portals the bright morning sun can be seen reflecting off the city's rooftops. DOC PULLS THE WAGON to an abrupt halt within a parking stall - - at an isolated area. He steps out onto the concrete flooring, slams the door shut. Doc turns away from the car. As he approaches the elevator, Doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops them into a trash bin without missing a stride.
S: INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING
N: CAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward. She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike. Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend off into clumped rows within the wings of the station. CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly ticket-seller looks across to her.
C: CAROL
D: Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer.
C: TICKET-SELLER
D: Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in forty-five minutes, gate three.
N: Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the seemingly acres-wide station promenade. NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances across the promenade walls, her eyes finding: A CLOCK READING: 9:40 ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her. Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap, pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather satchel. CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying the suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry around her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding a glass- walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins to trudge in that direction. A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder. THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.
C: DAPPER MAN
D: Kind of tricky, isn't it?
N: She turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand, deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open. Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests it to show that it has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his intentions.
C: CAROL
D: Thank you.
C: DAPPER MAN
D: No trouble lady.
E: toothy grin
N: Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail Lounge.
S: INT. BARN - DAY
N: EMPTY CAGES STACKED ALONG A WOODEN WALL A YOUNG KITTEN IN A CARDBOARD BOX wrestling with the barrel of a .44. A thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the fur along the cat's neck and backbone. RUDY BUTLER IS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE CAT, giving little attention to the thirtyish Man standing nearby. HAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn- like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls, cages and pens, many of them vacant. The wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been attached to his left arm and shoulder. FRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite Rudy. Five years younger than her husband, tight sweater and skirt, bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her face suggests sensuality. Fran's bare, milk-white legs are crossed under her rumpled skirt.
C: RUDY
D: What's the damage?
E: to Harold
C: HAROLD
D: Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
C: RUDY
D: I got a nurse in mind.
C: HAROLD
D: The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
E: going along, oblivious to the implication
C: RUDY
D: The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
E: flashing a grin despite the pain
C: HAROLD
D: That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
N: Rudy smiles at Mrs. Clinton. He's never met Fran before, but he's known her for years.
C: RUDY
D: Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
C: FRAN
D: Just... tell us what you want.
E: scared, but trying to be friendly
N: Rudy looks back down at the gun and cat. The following silence is like a scream. Finally:
C: RUDY
D: What kind of car do you have, Harold?
C: FRAN
D: A Ford... We have a Ford.
E: cutting in
C: RUDY
D: That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
N: He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton.
C: RUDY
D: She gets her clock fixed right away... You understand that, Harold?
E: CONT'D continuing
N: A long pause.
C: FRAN
D: You do what he says, Harold.
C: RUDY
D: After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
C: HAROLD
D: We really don't have too many friends.
C: FRAN
D: They don't think he married well.
C: RUDY
D: That makes things a little easier for us then, doesn't it?
E: smiling
S: INT. TRAINS STATION BAR - DAY
N: Carol sits in the bar. A young SOLDIER approaches and sits down at the counter next to her. She is finishing a vodka gimlet.
C: SOLDIER
D: Beer.
E: to a bartender
N: Carol glances at her watch.
C: SOLDIER
D: Guess you have to catch a train?
E: CONT'D continuing - begins with the obvious
C: THE SOLDIER
D: pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has to shave maybe twice a week; twenty-one years old, not good-looking and not a hustler. He just wats to meet a girl.
E: his best feature is his gentle, easy grin
C: CAROL
D: That's right.
E: not too patronizing
C: SOLDIER
D: Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
N: The soldier's beer arrives.
C: CAROL
D: Where's home?
C: SOLDIER
D: Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
C: CAROL
D: No, I'm not.
E: chuckles
C: SOLDIER
D: Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
C: CAROL
D: That certainly makes you kind of special...
C: SOLDIER
D: Yeah... I guess it does.
E: awkward
N: Carol pushes aside her glass.
C: SOLDIER
D: You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
E: CONT'D c ont inuing
C: CAROL
D: No, I'm afraid not.
E: smiles across to him
C: SOLDIER
D: I never have any luck.
N: Carol smiles at the soldier. Her features suddenly freeze as she glances toward the entrance to the bar. AT THE DOORWAY DOC STANDS LOOKING AT CAROL and the soldier.
C: CAROL
D: STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
C: CAROL
D: I really hope you have a nice trip.
E: CONT'D
C: SOLDIER
D: Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
N: Carol moves towards the exit. The soldier quietly sips his beer, his face a bit grim. AT THE DOORWAY CAROL STOPS NEAR DOC. They look at each other...
C: DOC
D: Where's the suitcase?
N: Carol continues looking at Doc for a moment. Then, suddenly moves past him, leading him out into the main lobby. BACK WITHIN THE PROMENADE SERIES OF ANGLES CAROL EMERGES FROM THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE followed by Doc. They cross to the lockers. She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then forcing the key, shakes the lock violently. Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the locker number and then the number on the key. Her features are now totally ashen. She walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty. Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear... Doc at her shoulder.
C: CAROL
D: A man helped me open it...
C: DOC
D: And switched keys.
E: deceptive calm
C: CAROL
D: He must have.
C: DOC
D: It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
E: angrily
N: Carol winces, containing her anger.
C: DOC
D: How long ago.
E: CONT'D continuing - icily
C: CAROL
D: Fifteen minutes.
C: DOC
D: Sure?
N: Carol nods.
C: DOC
D: He'd figure you for longer, enough time to try another hit. He's probably still in the station.
E: CONT'D continuing - with quick calculation
N: As Doc pushes Carol forward.
C: DOC
D: There better be a guy with the
E: CONT'D continuing - lashing out
C: CAROL
D: You bastard...
E: lashing back
N: Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the promenade... eyes straining. CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of lockers, the black suitcase at his feet. THE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons. DOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of lockers. CAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now disappeared from view. She sags back against the edge of the metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.
C: LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
D: Attention please.
E: indistinct above the roar of the station MORE
C: LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
D: The Flyer now boarding at gate three. The Flyer now boarding at gate three.
E: CONT'D
N: Carol again raises her eyes. Still breathless, her face glows with moisture.
S: INT. THE CLINTON'S BARN - (MORNING)
N: FRAN IS STILL SEATED ON THE STOOL. Rudy stares at her from the cot. Harold is now absent.
C: FRAN
D: I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
C: RUDY
D: That right?
E: he speaks very politely
C: FRAN
D: You can trust him...
C: RUDY
D: How long have you been married?
C: FRAN
D: Two years.
C: RUDY
D: Can he trust you?
C: FRAN
D: That's what matters, isn't it?
E: smiles
N: Rudy continues looking at her.
C: RUDY
D: Come over here a minute...
N: He gestures with his gun. Fran crosses the distance slowly, moving with apprehension.
C: FRAN
D: Look, I'm not going to be any trouble to you either, fact is, this may sound funny, but maybe you and I could be close friends...
N: Rudy gestures her closer...
C: FRAN
D: You don't always have to have your gun out. I'll get whatever you want. Really, I will...
E: CONT'D continuing
N: Fran smiles. She is now standing over the cot, looking directly down at Rudy. He jerks her down.
C: RUDY
D: Get rid of that nail polish, I don't like it, and when I tell you to come over here you move fast. You and I are going to get along because I've known a lot of people like you, so don't tell me about it because I got your ticket going in. Now get up and get that paint of your fingers... okay?
E: still polite
N: Rudy smiles.
S: INT. TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY
N: DOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes in. After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse. Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference. THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long corridor. DOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed off departure/arrival gates. THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open stairway winding downward. DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and starts back up the platform towards the concourse. Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers scurrying toward the awaiting train... THE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach passengers. CAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight, visible on the next level below. THE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and into the rail car passageway. DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the conductor and into the train. THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the forward compartments. DOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car vestibule. ON THE CONCOURSE CAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc. She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will take her down to trackside... Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring down at the shining train.
S: INT. FLYER - DAY COACH
N: THE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks, clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried but controlled pace. AT THE END OF A PULLMAN DOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle. She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an overhead carriage. Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her. 30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30? empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a run. DOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR. The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the front of the train. THE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER. This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace, swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car. The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door, hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps. DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still unknowingly two cars behind the Thief. THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door swings open.
S: INT. MEN'S LOUNGE
N: The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him, crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window. He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly jammed... DOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the smoker. THE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and, like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and begins going back in the opposite direction. DOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.
C: PORTER
D: Be open five minutes out of the station.
E: appearing suddenly at Doc's shoulder
N: Doc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps toward his point of entrance onto the train. THE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket. DOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars.
S: INT. MEN'S LOUNGE
N: THE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls the shade lower.
S: EXT. TRACK
N: METAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS, then begins to move forward. THE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the train edges forward. His body suddenly tightens. He sees Doc outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of moving passenger cars and several parked tinders.
C: THIEF'S POV
D: DOC GLANCING BETWEEN PARKED PASSENGER CARS, walking cautiously ahead. As the Flyer continues to move slowly forward, Doc disappears from view.
N: THE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps back out into the vestibule. AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch tickets. As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him. He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then, Doc sits down next to the Thief. DOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE THIEF'S NECK, pulling him close.
C: DOC
D: When you pop a lock don't mark it.
E: softly almost gently
N: The Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms. THE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's fingers are vise-like at his wrist. THE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter. THE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from Doc and the Thief. He continues collecting and punching fares.
S: INT. STATION GATE - DAY
N: CAROL IS EXITING. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER -- the train has left.
S: INT. TRAIN - DAY
N: THE CONDUCTOR AS SEEN BY THE THIEF'S WIDENING EYES. He methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two seats ahead. THE THIEF'S EYES BULGE AS DOC CHOPS HIM ON THE WINDPIPE. The Thief goes out. Is he dead? DOC CHOPS HIM AGAIN. IF HE ISN'T DEAD HE LOOKS IT. Doc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head.
S: INT. STATION - DAY
N: CAROL CROSSES INTO THE STATION, TAKES A DEEP BREATH. Sits... waiting. The soldier comes by, stops. She doesn't recognize anything.
S: INT. TRAIN - DAY
N: THE CONDUCTOR ARRIVES AT THE LOUNGE CHAIRS WHERE DOC AND THE thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly leaning in Doc's direction.
C: CONDUCTOR
D: Tickets?
N: As Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it to him.
C: DOC
D: End of the line. Two.
C: CONDUCTOR
D: All right.
E: grumpily
N: The conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make change. THE THIEF SITS FACING THE WINDOW LOOKING VERY DEAD
S: INT. CLINTON'S FORD - DAY
N: RUDY SITS IN THE BACK SEAT AS HAROLD CAUTIOUSLY MOTORS DOWN the highway. With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat.
C: RUDY

N: Harold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel.
C: FRAN
D: Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
E: chuckling at Harold
C: RUDY
D: I Just want to find a suitcase.
S: INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON'S RANCH - DAY
N: BEYNON'S BODY REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT behind the overturned kitchen table... a small trickle of blood oozes out from under one of the table legs. The Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring down at Beynon's body.
C: ACCOUNTANT
D: They may still be going to Nogales.
C: SWAIN
D: What about Laughlin in El Paso?

C: ACCOUNTANT
D: Tonight... take him out in the country, throw him down a dry well, if you can find one.
S: INT. PULLMAN CAR - DAY
N: AS DOC THUMBS IDLY THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER. He is suddenly showered with spurting water. He lowers the paper and looks to the aisle, seeing: A SEVEN YEAR OLD BLACK PANTHER, dressed appropriately and holding a water pistol.
C: KID
D: Stick 'em up!
N: Doc looks at the brat.
C: KID
D: I'm gonna shoot you...
E: CONT'D continuing
N: He squeezes the pistol's trigger, two bursts of water land on Doc's shirt front. Doc continues staring at the boy. The kid looks hard at Doc, not giving an inch.

On his way back to the cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto tire. With his newly-found prize, the Driver re-enters the truck and drives away. THE BOX LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER AMONGST the broken bottles, melon rinds, flashlight batteries, tin cans, used tires. DOC SAWS AT A CORNER OF THE CARDBOARD BOX with his penknife. The matted paper gives away, allowing them more room within the box.

He puts two of them on the bureau drawer top... the other two he begins to tear into sections and places them into a large ashtray. He touches a match to the scraps.

C: CAROL
D: All right. You'll have to hold on a minute, my husband's in the shower...
N: DOC breaks the lock and opens the door -- he quickly crosses the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his automatic, then gingerly cracks the door. His eyes tighten in amazement as he sees: RUDY STANDING SLIGHTLY BEHIND FRAN, his .44 held tightly up to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use. Rudy and Fran are 15 feet down the hallway from Doc's slightly opened door. They both have their backs turned to him in three-quarter fashion. DOC BAREFOOTED., BARE-CHESTED; he decides on a course of action. The door swings quietly open. WITHIN THE HALLWAY, DOC CLOSES THE DISTANCE between himself and Rudy in two swift strides, Rudy turns,, swinging his gun, too late, as Doc's .45 crashes against his head. Rudy drops. Fran screams. Rudy looks at Doc, still smiling, eyes glazed. He falls abruptly. Doc stands over the fallen body. Fran continues to scream. Doc finally turns away from Rudy, looking now at the screaming woman. He flattens her with a left hook to the jaw. Fran drops to the floor as if she had been shot. Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent. RUDY'S HEAD IS BLOODIED. He lies without movement. DOC NOW SLAMS AT THE DOOR OF 318
C: DOC

N: Carol swings the door open. Doc bursts back into the room, grabs his shirt, begins to button it.

D: Just get your clothes on...
N: THE FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR AS DOC AND CAROL COME BACK OUT OF 318 they step over the fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator. Carol stops as she recognizes Rudy. Doc pulls her along, forcing her to keep moving. Carol again carries the brown suitcase, Doc holds the shotgun. They go down the back (or front) stairs.
S: INT. LOBBY
N: THE ACCOUNTANT STANDS AT ONE CORNER OP THE RECEPTION COUNTER IN THE LOBBY OF LAUGHLINS. Within an alcove behind and to one side of the desk (the area serving as an office) Cully, Swain and Hayhoe have stretched Laughlin across the pine desk. The Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the hotel3 acting as lookout. CULLY INSIDE THE ALCOVE LIFTS A SNAPPED OFF LEG of the heavy chair to use as a club. The thug turns back to the desk where Swain and Hayhoe have Laughlin pinioned.
C: CULLY
D: Just tell us the room number.
N: LAUGHLIN LOOKS BACK AT CULLY. He is very frightened but says nothing. CULLY SLAMS THE WOODEN CLUB DOWN ON LAUGHLIN KNEECAP

C: LAUGHLIN

S: INT. LOBBY STAIRS
N: DOC AND CAROL EMERGE,, MOVING QUICKLY FOR THE. main entrance. They get five steps before simultaneously seeing the Accountant.
C: CAROL
D: Doc !
N: Doc and Carol freeze for an instant. The Accountant snaps his fingers twice. Cully lowers his club, looks to the Accountant, as do Swain and Hayhoe. The Accountant smiles, staring at Doc and Carol.
C: ACCOUNTANT
D: Out here.
E: calmly to his men
N: CULLY, SWAIN AND HAYHOE APPEAR FROM THE ALCOVE BEHIND the Accountant. They look over his shoulder toward the rear of the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol.
S: INT. WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY
N: DOC HAS ONE HAND IN HIS OUTSIDE COAT POCKET, WRAPPED around the .45. Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in front of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk. Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden staircase.
C: ACCOUNTANT
D: Just have her set it down.
N: Doc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture revealing that his palm is empty.
C: DOC
D: You want it? Come and take it.
N: THE ACCOUNTANT NOW PLANKED BY THE THREE MEN
C: ACCOUNTANT
D: Get him.
E: quietly
N: As the three men reach for their guns. DOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO THE RIGHT, levels the disguised shotgun and fires in the same movement. The reception desk near the Accountant splinters from the blast and he is hit painfully. The other three men duck away from the sudden burst of fire power. DOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS HAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon, Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover. They miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring. ON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with his right. WITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES Cully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol. All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their hands. SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard. HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly up and fires. DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister supports. INSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow indicator pass "Two." DOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two shots back down the stairwell. SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder. SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver straight up... empties it. DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell with a huge roar. THE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to continue moving upward. Cannon following. THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT "THREE" CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The Accountant remains within the elevator. SWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD CAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing, keep moving upwards towards the third. Doc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces. RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door. CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five steps behind. DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT SWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within the elevator. Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As Carol screams: Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45 in his right. CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of their mark. DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The plaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward. THE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT THE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley housing. The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car. WITHIN THE LOBBY AS THE ELEVATOR SLAMS TO A WRENCHING STOP FIVE FEET ABOVE the floor level. The Accountant bounces from the floor of the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor. Laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain. He sees the suspended car through the iron grill door. The Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the elevator. His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle. DOC ON THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING HE JAMS SEVERAL SHELLS INTO HIS RIOT GUN WHILE HOLDING his .45 ready for an appearance by Swain. Reloading completed, he stands, with Carol. He again begins to move upward. SWAIN FIRES FROM THE STAIRWELL DOC STOPS, SETS BOTH THE RIOT GUN AND THE .45 on 562 the banister... He waits... on the winding staircase below him there is a dark movement. DOC FIRES BOTH GUNS THE STAIRWELL AROUND SWAIN DISINTEGRATES. The thug is obliterated by the firepower. DOC CANNOT SEE THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOTS. He again resumes his flight upward.
S: INT. DOC'S BATHROOM
N: RUDY HOLDS HIS BLOODY HEAD IN THE SINK BOWL, DUMBLY splashing water over himself. Carol's underwear is still present. Rudy's pistol lies on the soap tray. THE LANDING AS DOC AND CAROL COME POUNDING INTO VIEW. No further avenues open, they turn down the corridor. Doc grabs Carol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the door shut.
S: INT. THE ROOM
N: DOC GRABS THE SUITCASE, RUNS TO THE WINDOW, TEARS off the shade, lifts the frame, looks. The drop is too far. He grabs Carol and runs into the hallway.

S: EXT. FIRE ESCAPE
N: THEY DESCEND THE FIRE ESCAPE. They reach the end. The fire escape stays rigid. Doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps. He turns and with the suitcase crosses to the end. Throws the bag and the shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall, preparing to jump. RUDY COMES OUT OF THE ROOM ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE holding his .44. He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun. Carol screams. DOC JUMPS. RUDY FIRES. DOC IS HIT IN THE SIDE (flesh wound). In the air he spins and lands. Rudy fires again and again as he runs down the fire escape. Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun and fires. RUDY'S TIME HAS COME. THE JUMBO CHARGES MASH HIM BACK against the wall and off the fire escape. CAROL RUNS ALMOST STAGGERING AND GETS READY TO JUMP the six feet. THE FIRE ESCAPE. BEGINS TO SINK. CAROL LOOKS AT DOC mutely, as she sinks beneath the retaining wall.
C: DOC
D: Jump!
E: his hand out
N: And she does. He catches her and pulls her up. They look at one another for a long moment, then he stands and helps her to her feet, and leaving the shotgun behind they walk into the alley. RUDY LIES DEAD BEHIND THEM IN A PARKING LOT AT THE END OF THE ALLEY, SLIM, a tough, grizzly Western is about to pull out. Doc opens the back door and Carol gets in.

C: SLIM

N: AS THEY HIT THE MAIN HIGHWAY, DOC PULLS OFF AND STOPS.
C: CAROL
D: What now?
C: DOC
D: We walk.
N: THEY ARE WALKING ALONG THE HIGHWAY, THE EDSEL IS now a dot in the background. Another dot appears, grows bigger, as it gets closer it is a bus. Very Mexican but very Greyhound in appearance. Doc and Carol turn, Doc flags it down. It pulls to a stop, they board. The bus pulls out.
S: INT. BUS
N: DOC PAYS AND THEN FOLLOWS CAROL TO A SEAT. They sit. Mexico rolls by outside the window. They look at each other and smile.
C: VOICE
D: Hey!
E: O.S.
N: Doc and Carol look back. THE BLACK PANTHER IS LEANING OVER THE SEAT, his empty fist cocked up like a pistol. He grins.
C: BLACK PANTHER
D: Bang!
E: pulling the trigger
N: Doc and Carol look at him. FREEZE FRAME.
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
