(PAUSE) He think's he's hurt his knee--but the assurance, the assurance, the assurance that someone cares (WHEEZE WHEEZE) Suggests the hurt was elsewhere.
C: STARLING
D: Mr. Verger, thank you for your time.

D: Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction. Several large reserve bids have been placed on them. I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
C: VERGER
D: Because?
C: STARLING
D: Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
C: VERGER
D: And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
C: STARLING
D: Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. And because you have large resources.

E: WHEEZE PAUSE
C: STARLING
D: ...sir...?
C: VERGER
D: Isn't it funny? You can look on my face which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me. Which shows a Strength which must come from strong strong convictions. But you shy when I say the name of God.

D: I have not, I would not. For life life goes on Starling. And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... I'm... One moment. I was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter. I was afflicted before. Before. Do you see? In my arrogance.

C: PAZZI
D: They got that kind of money?
C: COP ONE

E: SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY
S: INT PAZZI'S APARTMENT DAY.
N: A NICE MODERN SMALL APARTMENT. ANNA PAZZI, A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN OF AROUND THIRTY IS STANDING IN THE HALL, AS PAZZI ENTERS. HE BEGINS KISSING HER, AND CAMERA MOVES THEM INTO THE BEDROOM.
C: ANNA
D: What's the rush? What's the rush...?
C: PAZZI
D: Aren't you glad to see me?
C: ANNA
D: Tell me about your trip... what did you bring me...?
N: HE STOPS, AND RUMMAGES IN HIS CASE, AND BRINGS OUT A BOTTLE OF PERFUME. HE GIVES IT TO HER. SHE LOOKS DISAPPOINTED. ANNA (cont'd) ...and?
C: PAZZI
D: I brought you my passion and my wish that this afternoon will be for you an experience of ecstasy...

C: ANNA
D: ...and I want to talk to you about your promotion..
C: PAZZI
D: Yes? My promotion...?
C: ANNA
D: I want to talk to you about your salary. Because I can't...
N: HE TAKES OFF HIS JACKET, HE TAKES THE PERFUME BOX FROM HER, AND THROWS IT INTO THE OPENED SUITCASE. HE MOVES HER TOWARD THE BED. ANGLE ON THE SUITCASE, WHERE WE SEE THE PERFUME HAS LANDED IN THE VERY SCARF WHICH STARLING GAVE TO PAZZI EARLIER, ALSO IN THE STILL-LIFE IS PAZZI'S PASSPORT CASE, OUT OF THE TOP OF WHICH WE SEE PEEKING A BIT OF THE PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING THE WANTED POSTER "THREE MILLION DOLLARS REWARD FOR THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE MONSTER, HANNIBAL LECHTER." THEY CONTINUE TO TALK, AS THE AUDIENCE READS THE INFORMATION IN THE INSERT. PAZZI (cont'd) (VO) (CONCLUDING) I need you, y'understand, I need you...

S: INT PALAZZO VECCHIO, VARIOUS RECONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION
N: GOING ON. PAZZI AND COP ONE MOUNT THE STAIRS.
C: COP ONE
D: Carlo Fanelli, Dottore, missing two months. He was the Director of the Museum. Which, since his absence...
N: THEY HAVE ARRIVED ON A LANDING. VARIOUS RESTORATION CREWS ARE AT WORK. PROFESSOR RICCI, A CONTEMPORARY OF PAZZIS, COMES UP TO HIM.
C: RICCI
D: Ah, Pazzi. How was America...?
N: THEY TURN THEIR HEADS. AT THE SOUND OF SHOUTING. ANGLE THEIR POV. A LARGE SALON, ITS DOUBLE DOOR OPEN, AND TEN CHAIR ARRANGED AROUND A TABLE, ALL FULL OF SEATED OLDER MEN, OF WHOM SEVERAL ARE EXPOSTULATING WITH ANOTHER FIGURE, UNSEEN. ANGLE ON RICCI, PAZZI, ET AL. RICCI (cont'd) We may need you to stop bloodshed.
C: PAZZI
D: What're they on about?
C: RICCI
D: They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
C: PAZZI
D: Speaking of the Vacant Post.
C: RICCI
D: Dottore Fanelli...
C: COP
D: He hasn't, by any chance, wandered back in?
N: AS COP ONE TALKS WITH RICCI, CAMERA GOES OVER THE SHOULDER OF PAZZI, WHO, GINGERLY ENTERS THE SALON, TO THE SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE OLD MEN ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER. ANGLE, HIS POV. THE OLD MEN AT THE TABLE. SOGLIATO, A FELLOW IN HIS SEVENTIES, IS HOLDING THE FLOOR.
C: SOGLIATO
D: Now: our applicant holds in his hand, in his Non-Italian-Hand, a note, from Dante Aligheri himself. Would he recognize it, I think not...
C: ANOTHER OLD MAN
D: You want the job for your nephew.
C: SOGLIATO
D: Indeed I do. Because he is my Nephew? No. Because he....
C: A THIRD OLD MAN
D: Let him read the note...
C: SOGLIATO
D: Yes, fine, of course he can read the note. His Italian is admirable, for a straniero. But is he familiar with...
N: ANGLE ON THE MAN, PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN OF WHOM THEY ARE TALKING. THE MOVEMENT OF THE POV REVEALS HIM, STANDING ALONE, BACK TO CAMERA, BEFORE A HALF CLOTH-COVERED TAPESTRY, DRESSED IN A MAGNIFICENT SUIT, USING HALF-GLASSES TO LOOK DOWN AT A NOTE IN HIS HAND. SOGLIATO (cont'd) (VO) The personalities of pre-Renaissance Florence? I think not. THE MAN (HANNIBAL LECHTER/DR. FELL) STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR-- STILL LOOKING AT THE NOTE--NODS TO INDICATE HE HAS HEARD. ANGLE HIS POV THE TABLE OF OLD MEN, AND BEYOND THEM, PAZZI. RICCI APPEARS AT PAZZI'S SIDE, AND SPEAKS IN WHISPERS.
C: RICCI
D: ...a Dr. Fell. A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
E: SOTTO
C: PAZZI
D: Brazilian.
E: VACANTLY RICCI HANDS SOME FORMS TO PAZZI
C: RICCI
D: It would seem.
C: SOGLIATO
D: What if he came upon a note in, the Capponi Library, this great Italian Institution, which he now graces us with his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de Cavalcanti. Would he recognize it, I think not.
E: VO
N: ANGLE ON DR. FELL, STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR, AS HE TAKES A SILK SQUARE FROM HIS BREAST POCKET, AND CLEANS HIS HALF- GLASSES, THEN FOLDS THEM AND PUTS THEM AND THE SQUARE BACK IN HIS POCKET. SOGLIATO (cont'd) (VO) Would you care to address that, Dr. Fell...? BEAT. DR. FELL TURNS TO CAMERA, STILL HOLDING THE NOTE. HE TAKES SEVERAL PACES, TO LOOK AT THE NOTE IN A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT. HE IS STANDING BESIDE THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES. HE NODS AT THE NOTE, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING. THEN HE LOOKS UP.
C: DR. FELL
D: Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's first sonnet. Do you know it, Professor Sogliato? I believe it's worth your time: Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia-- the eloquent voice of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo. If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have been to Andrea, the most literary of his brothers....
C: SOGLIATO
D: ...why do you want this job?
C: DR. FELL
D: In the hope, that someday, I should come across such a note. I thank you gentleman for your kind attention, and hope you will consider...
N: THE MEETING IS ABOUT TO BREAK UP, THE OLD MEN ARE RISING, FELL HANDS BACK THE NOTE, WHICH IS ENCASED IN A PROTECTOR, RICCI COMES FORWARD WITH PAZZI, AND BEGINS INTRODUCING HIM TO THE COMMITTEE.
C: RICCI
D: ...investigating the disappearance of Dottore Fanelli...
C: PAZZI
D: Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any enemies, that...
C: COMMITTEE MEMBER
D: ...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
C: PAZZI
D: ...he was wealthy...
C: COMMITTEE MEMBER
D: He had nothing. He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
C: PAZZI
D: ...his family has offered a large reward.
N: ANGLE ON FELL, WHO GOES TO THE PEDIMENT OF THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES, AND PICKS UP A SMALL SKETCH BOOK, WHICH IS OPENED AT A SKETCH OF THE STATUE, HE PUTS THE BOOK UNDER HIS ARM. ANGLE ON PAZZI AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBER.
C: COMMITTEE MEMBER
D: His older brother offers the reward, Fanelli had nothing, he....
N: ANGLE. PAZZI HALF TURNS HIS HEAD, TO SEE SEVERAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS CONGRATULATING DR. FELL, WHO IS PUTTING ON HIS COAT. COMMITTEE MEMBER (cont'd) ...will have, of course to be examined by the Studiolo, to confirm the appointment, but I think I can assure you, that the Committee...
C: DR. FELL
D: ...you are most kind...
N: ANGLE, ON PAZZI, WHO IS STILL BEING TALKED AT BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBER.
C: COMMITTEE MEMBER
D: ..who would benefit from his disappearance? No one. No one has but lost by it...
N: ANGLE PAZZI STARTS TOWARD DR. FELL.
C: PAZZI
D: ...would you excuse me...?
E: TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBER
S: ANGLE EXT THE SALON, ON THE LANDING, FELL IS BEING ADDRESSED
N: BY RICCI.
C: RICCI
D: ...will have to face the Studiolo, in their meeting next week. And I, for one, wish you the best.
N: FELL SHAKES HIS HAND, AND STARTS DOWN THE STAIRCASE. CAMERA GOES WITH HIM, WE HEAR PAZZI VO.
C: PAZZI
D: Dottore...
N: FELL TURNS, AND PAZZI COMES TO CATCH UP WITH HIM. PAZZI (cont'd) Pazzi, Rinaldo, Commendatore, Prefatura...
C: FELL
D: Of course, Commendatore...
N: CAMERA TAKES THEM DOWN THE STAIRS, AS THEY TALK.
C: PAZZI
D: Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
C: FELL
D: I never met him. I knew him only from his writings.
C: PAZZI
D: I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a suicide note...
C: FELL
D: ...yes.
C: PAZZI
D: You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
C: FELL
D: It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
C: PAZZI
D: Of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
C: FELL
D: Yes. Packed and with an inventory.
E: HE HESITATES, AND LOOKS AT PAZZI
N: PAZZI AND FELL WALK OUT OF THE MUSEUM.
S: ANGLE EXT THE MUSEUM.
C: PAZZI
D: I'll have them picked up.
N: PAZZI GESTURES TO HIS COLLEAGUE. PAZZI (cont'd) May we drop you?
C: FELL
D: Thank you, I am most happy to walk in this most magnificent of cities.
N: FELL STARTS PULLING ON HIS GLOVES, HE HANDS HIS SKETCHBOOK TO PAZZI FOR A MOMENT. PAZZI LOOKS DOWN. ANGLE PAZZI'S POV FELL'S LEFT HAND, HAS A SCAR ON THE BACK IN THE SHAPE OF A
C: PAZZI
D: May I ask you a personal question, Dr. Fell?
C: FELL
D: If your duty requires it.
C: PAZZI
D: You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
C: FELL
D: And you have a new wedding ring on yours? La Vita Nuova?--
E: HE SMILES.
C: PAZZI
D: You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
C: FELL
D: Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard? Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
C: PAZZI
D: Why did you look at me that way?
C: FELL
D: I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean. Just dressed--in the middle of the...
E: SMILES
N: FELL SHAKES HIS HEAD, ASKING TO HAVE THE QUESTION WITHDRAWN.
C: PAZZI
D: ...please...
C: FELL
D: I saw a man, somewhat fatigued. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled. In the middle of the day. An old story. And then I saw the clothing was fresh--therefore: a man who dressed at home. And then I remarked the new wedding ring. And so: the story gave me pause. A lovely story. A new, and a beloved wife. I wish you joy.
E: SHRUGS, SMILES SMILES FELL STARTS TO EXIT
N: PAZZI WALKS WITH HIM.
C: PAZZI
D: You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
C: FELL
D: I'm a historian. It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
E: SHRUGS
C: PAZZI
D: ...your scar..?
C: FELL
D: My scar is a war-wound.
C: PAZZI
D: How so?
C: FELL
D: Carpal-tunnel syndrome. From a life of typing. Commendatore. History, a hazardous profession.
N: FELL AND THEN PAZZI STOP. FELL (cont'd) You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you not?
C: PAZZI
D: Yes. How did you know?
C: FELL
D: You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
C: PAZZI
D: It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist. You have seen the chapel?
C: FELL
D: I have had the honor.
E: HE BOWS AND STARTS OFF. PAZZI GOES AFTER HIM.
N: FELL TURNS TO HIM. FELL (cont'd) I wondered that an officer of your exalted rank should come, so late, into the case.
C: PAZZI
D: And? Then?
C: FELL
D: I wonder no longer. You were out of the country.
C: PAZZI
D: How could you know?
C: FELL
D: I sense... The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose base, whose base, whose base is "Hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such a clean scent. No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World. I would say, you have been in America. Have I struck home?
E: HE TOUCHES HIS NOSE
C: PAZZI
D: You know America?
C: FELL
D: ...you have brought this perfume... brought this perfume. Back. Back from America. To your New Wife... (HE PICKS UP HIS HAND, AND
C: GLANCES DOWN AT PAZZI'S WEDDING RING.)
D: You have given it to her, and some of... Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you. Lucky man. Lucky man, indeed.
E: HE SMILES
N: HE BOWS, AND STARTS TO TAKE HIS LEAVE, FROM THE STARTLED PAZZI. PAZZI COMES TO HIS SENSES, AND HANDS A CARD TO FELL.
C: PAZZI
D: Should you come across anything which...
C: FELL
D: You will be the first I call.
N: FELL TURNS TO LEAVE, TURNS BACK, AND TAKES HIS HAND AND, GENTLY RUBS IT ON THE LAPEL OF PAZZI'S SUITJACKET, HE THEN, DELICATELY, HOLDS THE HAND UNDER HIS NOSE, AND NODS, AS IF IN AGREEMENT WITH HIMSELF. HE NODS, AND WALKS OFF INTO A PARK. ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL. HE WALKS BACK TOWARD THE CAR. HE TURNS, TO LOOK AFTER FELL, AND WE SEE HE IS STANDING BY A LINE OF PEOPLE, A QUEUE, UNDER A BANNER WHICH PROCLAIMS, "ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE." PAZZI SHAKES HIS HEAD, AS IF TO CLEAR IT, AND STARTS TOWARD HIS CAR, WHERE COP ONE OPENS THE OOOR FOR HIM. ANGLE ON FELL, AS CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PARK, WHICH, WE SEE, IS A CEMETERY. HE SITS ON A BENCH, AND TAKES OUT HIS SKETCHBOOK, AND BEGINS TO DRAW. ANGLE HIS POV. A PIECE OF FUNERAY STATUARY, THE LION, HOLDING THE BIRD IN HIS MOUTH. ANGLE ON DR. FELL, SKETCHING. TIGHT. HE SKETCHES, HE RAISES HIS HAND TO HIS NOSE AND INHALES, AND NODS AGAIN. ANGLE, FROM THE SIDE, WE NOW SEE THE STATUE AND FELL'S DRAWING. HE IS DRAWING, NOT THE STATUE, BUT A SKETCH OF CLARICE STARLING.

BARNEY WALKS INTO THE POV, PICKS UP THE DOVE, AND WALKS TO A SMALL RATTY VERGE OF PARK. HE PUTS THE DOVE DOWN, LOVINGLY IN THE GRASS, AND WE WATCH, AS THE OTHER DOVE LANDS ON A FENCE, NEARBY. BARNEY STARTS TO WALK TOWARD THE LIVE BIRD. ANGLE OVER THE BIRD, ONTO BARNEY, WITH STARLING WALKING UP BEHIND HIM. BARNEY HESITATES, HIS BACK STILL TO STARLING.
C: BARNEY
D: Are you attracted by Death? It is the one great mystery, is it not? Anyone who would say otherwise must be a hypocrite. Don't you think...?
E: PAUSE
N: HE TURNS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LOOKS AT HER. BARNEY (cont'd) ...or are you only attracted by power... (HE CHANGES HIS TACK AND TONE.) How are you, Agent Starling?
C: STARLING
D: Ah, Barney: you've got a good mernory.
C: BARNEY
D: You know why that is? Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
C: STARLING
D: I have not read you your rights.
C: BARNEY
D: Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
N: STARLING STARTS TO OPEN HER BAG, AND SPEAKS INTO IT.
C: STARLING

D: You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.
C: STARLING
D: Well. Word gets around.
C: BARNEY
D: ...what hindered you...?
C: STARLING
D: It wasn't my day.
C: BARNEY
D: Perhaps you did not have the support you required.
C: STARLING
D: It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
C: BARNEY
D: Or, perhaps...
C: STARLING
D: ...how are things at the Hospital?
C: BARNEY
D: It's a growth business.
C: STARLING
D: What have they got you doing?
C: BARNEY
D: Orderly.
C: STARLING
D: I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.

E: TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK
C: BARNEY
D: Yes, I presumed it was about him.
C: STARLING
D: ...you...
C: BARNEY

E: GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS, AS SHE TAKES OUT A PENCIL.
C: BARNEY
D: He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil.
C: STARLING
D: Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?

C: STARLING
D: What...?
E: TURNING BACK
C: BARNEY
D: I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter. As the Soul of Man. Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
C: STARLING
D: We got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction. Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books.
C: BARNEY
D: Yes?
C: STARLING
D: And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
C: BARNEY
D: Why me?
C: STARLING
D: Waal, because your selling'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz. P.A.N.Z. Sounds to me like an Orderly. Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
C: BARNEY
D: ...very good.
C: STARLING
D: Here's what they want you to do: we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
C: BARNEY
D: ...why?
C: STARLING
D: Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
C: BARNEY
D: You said "here's what they want you to do..." Why?
C: STARLING
D: Now, whyn't you help us?
C: BARNEY
D: That would adversely impact my income.
C: STARLING
D: Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
C: BARNEY
D: We could skip the Gavotte.
C: STARLING
D: Say it in English.
C: BARNEY
D: Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
C: STARLING
D: Then who's buying it?
C: BARNEY
D: There's one or two freaks, and, for a "Pass," I'll rat them out to you...

C: STARLING
D: Let's keep it to business, shall we?
C: BARNEY
D: ...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?

C: NAMES)
D: Who are these guys...?
C: BARNEY
D: Rich, comic book freaks.
C: STARLING
D: And why is it a vacant exercise?
C: BARNEY
D: Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
C: STARLING
D: Who would that be.
C: BARNEY
D: (AS IF STATING THE MOST
C: OBVIOUS FACT.)
D: Mason Verger. For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice. Can you be free....?
C: STARLING
D: No, you're wrong about Verger.
C: BARNEY
D: Oh, yes. He's found Peace.

N: FELL WALKS UP TO THE IMAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DROPCLOTH, PAZZI WALKS BEHIND HIM. FELL (cont'd) (LOOKING AT THE IMAGE) It says Pazzi. Pazzi. And a rude, a very rude poem, this is your ancestor. Francesco, hanging outside the Palazzio Vecchio. Outside These Very Windows. HE TURNS AND FIXES PAZZI WITH HIS GAZE. ANGLE, FELL, HIS FACE SEEN IN THE DARK, IN THE BEAM OF THE SLIDE PROJECTOR. HOLD.

Or do I grow too personal? but that is what I think of, when I think of her. And how could I but think of her? I haven't had a bit all day. The kidney and the liver would be su1table for a dinner tonight. But the rest of the meat should hang for a week, in these cool conditions. Wouldn't you say? Nod once for yes. (PAUSE) If you tell me what I need to know, then it would be convenient for me to leave without my meal. And Mrs. Pazzi will remain unscathed. I'll out the questions to you, and we'll see: I saw at the theatre you had betrayed me. And, when the police didn't come, it was clear you had sold me out. Was it to Mason Verger? Blink one for yes. ANGLE ON PAZZI. BEAT. THEN HE BLINKS ONCE. FELL (cont'd) Thank you. And now: Are his hit men waiting outside? (PAZZI BLINKS ONCE) Was that a single blink? Yes. Thank you. FELL FINISHES HIS COILING OF THE ROPE, AND WE SEE HE HAS FASHIONED A HANGMAN'S NOOSE. FELL TAKES OUT A STILETTO, AND IT OPENS. HE ADVANCES TOWARD PAZZI, WHO TRIES TO RECOIL. FELL (cont'd) No, no. I'm going to take the tape off. Please do not scream. Do you think you can keep from screaming? (HE TAKES THE TAPE OFF) ...would it help if I were to cut your BOWELS OUT...? WE SEE HIM MAKE A SWIPE AND HEAR PAZZI START TO SCREAM. FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OF THE SALON, WE SEE PAZZI, TAPED TO THE PODIUM, BEING IMPELLED, SCREAMING, TOWARD THE WINDOW.

D: You've sought out The Institution all your life, as you with it to replace your Father. This is obvious. Less obvious is this: that you require the institution not to support you, but to FAIL. FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE.
N: ANGLE ON STARLING, SITTING, NODDING, AS SHE DRINKS HER WINE. SHE PUTS THE GLASS DOWN, A TRIFLE WOOZY. LECHTER (cont'd) ...as this keeps your father alive. The truth is two-fold, and the truth is one: THE WIND FROM THE OCEAN BLOWS A STRAND OF HAIR ACROSS HER EYES, SHE BRUSHES IT BACK.

HE MOVES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN, PUTS THE BREADED PIECES OF CUTLET INTO THE PAN, THE FIRE SHOOTS UP. LECHTER (cont'd) So many civilizations eat their slain enemies... what do you think...? How much better to devour a person physically, than to devour his spirit. Which is, of course, the purpose of the institution. HE REMOVES THE MEAT FROM THE PAN, AND FORKS IT ONTO A TIN PLATE. LECHTER (cont'd) (REENTERING THE DININGROOM) :and that is the especial surprise, I've prepared for You!
