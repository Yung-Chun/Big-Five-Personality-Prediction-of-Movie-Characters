M: GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE
M: This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
M: haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
M: the CAMERA with urgency:
M: ASH
M: Why would you say that I am
M: insane? I wouldn't say that I've
M: lost my mind simply because I've
M: heard the voices and seen the
M: godless things moving in the
M: woods. If anything, I think more
M: clearly now than ever before. I
M: know now that there is such a
M: thing as a living Evil. A dark
M: and shapeless thing that lives
M: not in the spaces we know, but
M: between them. In the Dark. In the
M: night. And it wants the exact same
M: thing as you and I: a chance at
M: warm life on this Earth. It
M: doesn't care that is already had
M: that chance ...once. Now listen
M: closely because there isn't much
M: time. Listen and believe, because
M: it's all true.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT
N: nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
C: ASH
D: I first saw the damn thing at that blasted cabin. The Necronomicon. An ancient Sumarrian text, bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. It contained bizarre burial rites, prophesies...and instruction for demon resurrection. It was never meant for the world of the living.
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
N: Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
C: ASH
D: The book awoke something dark in the woods.
E: V.O.
C: SUPERIMPOSE:
D: BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT inscribed on the pages. Illustrations of demonic faces with white eyes. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low through the woods toward the cabin. CAMERA rips through the cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
C: ASH
D: It got into my hand and it went bad. CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
E: V.O.
C: ASH
D: So I lopped it off at the wrist. INT. CABIN - NIGHT ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
E: V.O.
C: BLOOD RED CLOUDS
D: sweep past the moon.
C: ASH
D: In order to rid myself of the foul thing, I read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole. A hole in Time that would send the Evil back. And it worked. A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH recites the incantation from the Necronomicon. EXT. CABIN - NIGHT The Time vortex is created. Trees and a 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
E: V.O.
C: ASH
D: ...I just didn't plan on coming along. EXT. CABIN - NIGHT Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the funnel-cloud of the Time vortex. INT. TIME VORTEX Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds. He is swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of Time. ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM. The smoke swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the words:
E: V.O.
C: "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
D: "Vs" The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
C: "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
D: The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING... INT. TIME VORTEX
C: A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
D: its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
C: ASH
D: He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady BEATING of his heart. ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light. The funnel cloud electrifies.
C: ASH'S BODY
D: RIPS at the fabric of Time. EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY All is quiet. Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of a human body flashes briefly and is gone. A moment latter, Ash appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA. EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY ASH falls to the dust. His double barrelled shotgun lands beside him. The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground a moment later.

D: in 12th century armor ride up over a hill. They halt before Ash. WARRIOR #1 thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting: WARRIOR #1 Hail to him who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the Deadites! Hail!

C: WISEMAN JOHN
D: Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust. He is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA. DISSOLVE TO: THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN blazing in the sky above the wasteland. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides alongside him.
C: GOLD TOOTH
D: Move along now! DISSOLVE TO: LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff. A drawbridge is lowered. Arthur's warriors ride over it.
C: CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH
D: shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle walls. INT. CASTLE COURTYARD
C: SHEILA
D: a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned. She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur atop his horse.
C: SHEILA
D: M'Lord Arthur! Where is my brother? Did he not ride with you?
C: ARTHUR
D: Eye. And fought valiantly. But last night fell in battle to Duke Henry's men.
C: SHEILA
D: Her face does not immediately register the grief. She attempts to step forward but stumbles. She steadies herself against the stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash. She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks at him as he's dragged along.
C: SHEILA
D: Foul thing! A pox on your throat! Thou art a Murderer! A black Murderer!
C: VILLAGE WOMEN
D: restrain her.
C: SHEILA
D: cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her. VILLAGE WOMAN #1 May you be consoled by their suffering in the pit. THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the ground. This is THE PIT.
C: ASH
D: looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering what they have in store for him.
C: SHEILA
D: stares at him in hatred. THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH eyes Ash curiously. This is Duke Henry the Red.
C: DUKE HENRY
D: You sir, are not one of my vassals. Who are you?
C: ASH
D: Who wants to know?
C: DUKE HENRY
D: I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale. Lord of the Northlands and leader of its people.
C: ASH
D: You ain't leadin' but two things now, pal. Jack and shit. And Jack left town. A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS address the doomed men:
C: ARTHUR
D: There is an Evil that has awakened in this land. And whilst my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Duke Henry the Red, wage war on us. Your people are no better than the foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit! May God have mercy on your souls.
C: TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN
D: crank a massive wench. Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid slides back, revealing a dark hole. The Pit. FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT a echoed wailing rises up. ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS stiffen in fear. AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Aye. Into the pit with the bloodthirsty sons of whores! She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
C: CAMERA PANS TO...
D: HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 as he's thrown down into the pit. He disappears into the blackness. CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH watching with disbelief. We hear the warrior's echoed cry of terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom. CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT looking down into the blackness we hear: HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 I beg of you... by all that's holy! Lower a rope! Lower... Oh, for the love of god! no! NO!!! AIIIIIiiieee! The sound of ripping and scratching. The SHRIEK of terror is cut short as...
E: O.S.

C: ASH
D: is frozen in fear.
C: TOWER GUARD
D: There! He's escaping!
E: O.S.
C: ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
D: jerks from the pit to... TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2 making a break for it! He's past the guards, heading for the open drawbridge.
C: THE TOWER ARCHERS
D: spot him and fire arrows.
C: ANGLE ON PING! PING!
D: They bounce off the Warrior's armor. He's makes it to the open drawbridge when...
C: ARTHUR
D: pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow. ZING! He lets it fly. CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow... PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2 The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to a wooden post. He dies standing.
C: THE CROWD
D: Cheers. They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners: CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner in line...
C: ASH
D: turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
C: ASH
D: Hey, I never even saw these assholes before.. He spins to Duke Henry the Red. You gotta tell 'em you don't know me. We never met. Tell him.
C: HENRY
D: I do not believe that he shall listen.
C: THE WARRIORS
D: grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
C: ASH
D: tumbles down into the pit. He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul water at the pit's bottom. He stands and coughs out a mouthful
N: of the rancid water. He looks about.
S: INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.
N: UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
C: ASH
D: spins to a small sound. INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V. Nothing. Just the mist rising from the water.
C: ASH
D: shifts his glance again.
C: A SHADOW
D: rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
C: ASH
D: doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir. Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes break the surface.
C: ASH
D: spins... but there's nothing there. As he turns back around, he is confronted by...
C: A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
D: It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's face!
C: CLOSER
D: Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It jerks like a marionette as it advances.
C: ASH SCREAM
D: and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit. He tries to scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
C: THE DEADITE'S HAND
D: clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
C: DOWN ANGLE ON ASH
D: He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing. ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured. THE PIT - THE DEADITE grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists. ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA shouts for Ash's death. THE PIT - ASH'S FACE The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash. LONG SHOT - ASH is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.

C: ASH
D: cries out in pain.

C: THE DEADITE
D: grabs Ash by the throat. THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
C: THE DEADITE
D: advances. ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN shouts down at Ash. THE PIT - ASH trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an object falling at him through the glare above. THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION tumbling downward. Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its blade of steel. Ash's Excalibur! ASH - SLOW MOTION summons his strength and leaps upward. LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION Tumbling downward...

C: ASH
D: Come on, you blasted piece of-- He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
C: VERRROOOOOOM!!
D: ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw. Blue exhaust billows up from the pit. THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE lunges at Ash.
C: DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW
D: Buzzzzz!!
C: ASH
D: is splattered with black bile.
C: THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND
D: flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast. CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below. ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit. THE PIT - ASH raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite hand. He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
C: CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH
D: Ash decapitates the beast. ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this guy's guts and style.
C: THE LAST REMNANTS
D: of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
C: ASH
D: climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges from the earthen wall before him.
C: ASH
D: slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it back into the water. ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS gasp as...
C: THUMP! ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM
D: comes up, over the edge of the pit. Followed by... THUMP! Ash's bloody hand. Then his bruised face. Covered in the black blood of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet. Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
C: ASH
D: All right now. Who wants to be next? Who wants some.
C: GOLD TOOTH
D: look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
C: ASH
D: You want some more? Huh?! Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out to Henry.
C: ASH
D: Now climb on those horses and get out of here. HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS quickly mount horses.

D: Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
C: ASH
D: slaps Henry's horse.

C: ARTHUR
D: stares at Ash with hatred.
C: ARTHUR
D: For that, I shall see you dead.
C: ASH
D: removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
C: ASH
D: This is my boomstick. It's a twelve gauge, double barreled Remington pump. Next one of you primitives touch me...
C: ASH SPINS,
D: pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit on the forgotten chain. The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM! The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
C: ANGLE ON BLAMMITY-BLAM!
D: The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it summersaulting down into the pit. THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST echoes off the mountains like distant thunder. SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD look to Ash in reverence.
C: ASH
D: twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH... and holsters it.
C: ASH
D: Bring me your hoo do man. EXT. BLACKBIRDS fly from a barren tree. SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing... EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each twenty feet tall. The remains of an ancient temple. In the center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire. As old Woman stirs a cauldron atop the flames. Nearby, Arthur converses with his four Lieutenants. EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT CLOSE UP - ASH opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter. No sooner has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered. He waves it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
C: ASH AND SHEILA
D: sits across the flames from Arthur and his men. She bandages Ash's wounds.
C: SHEILA
D: is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
C: SHEILA
D: I pray thee to forgive me. I believed thee one of Henry's men. She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
C: ASH
D: First you wanta kill me, now ya wanna kiss me. He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
C: ASH
D: Lady, just leave me alone.
C: SHEILA
D: I'm sorry m'lord. Please understand... T'is a cruel time for us. The Wisemen say you are the promised one. Our only hope against the darkness that has descended on this land.
C: ASH
D: They're mistaken. She stares deeply into his eyes.
C: SHEILA
D: I think not. I feel that there is reason for your being here. It is no accident. 166 WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN 167 approach. They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from Ash.
C: ASH
D: Well what is it? Can you send me back or not?
C: WISEMAN JOHN
D: Only the Necronomicon has the power. A power which we both require. It contains passages that can dispel the Evil from this place and return you to your time.
C: ASH
D: The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's the thing that got me here.
C: WISEMAN JOHN
D: It is in a place far from here. It can only be retrieved by the Promised one. Other Warriors have tried. Their widows grieve still. We have waited long years for you. Out only hope is the Necronomicon. Thou must undertake to quest for it. Alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery. There thou shalt find it.
C: ASH
D: Me? Now way, no day. Only place I'm goin' is home. A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
C: DOGS
D: around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
C: ASH AND SHEILA
D: turn to see...
C: THE OLD WOMAN
D: now standing too close to the fire. Her robes ignites. She does not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir the caldron.
C: ASH
D: His haw drops. He slowly stands as...
C: THE BURNING WOMAN
D: spins sharply to him. Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
C: POSSESSED WOMAN YOU SHALL DIE!
D: Her eyes are bone white. She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit. Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal snarl. With two voice at once;
C: POSSESSED WOMAN
D: YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE NECRONOMICON. WE SHALL FEAST UPON YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
C: MAN! THE POSSESSED WOMAN
D: collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in the dust. CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open! A nasty grin forms on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen approach.
C: WISEMAN JOHN
D: kneels and reaches for her.
C: ASH'S HAND
D: clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
C: ASH
D: It's a trick. Get an axe.
C: THE POSSESSED WOMAN
D: awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK. In a frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
C: PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY
D: With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two warriors beneath it.
C: A GIGANTIC STONE
D: topples the next stone.
C: BOOM!
D: Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
C: BOOM! BOOM!

D: does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the stone's deadly path.
C: ASH AND SHEILA
D: rolls across the dusty stone courtyard. CLOSE SHOT - ASH rolls into frame and glances up to see... THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK! WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the ground.
C: ASH
D: rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
C: ANGLE ON
D: The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
C: BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
D: EXT. WITHIN THE TEMPLE RUINS - PAPER MACHE STONE
C: THE POSSESSES WOMAN
D: SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH! The multi-ton stone crushes her legs to paste. Her legs are pinned but still she battles on, clutching Ash about his throat!
C: ASH
D: gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon. POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
C: ASH
D: grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the monster's oversized throat. She chokes. GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS grab the beast and pull it off of Ash. Arthur comes to meet them. He carries a double-bladed battle axe.

D: vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
C: POSSESSED WOMAN
D: The Evil lives. Slay me and ten will rise to take my place. All will die. ALL WILL -

C: THE HEAD
D: rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet. It's eyes pop open!
C: POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD ---DIE! ARTHUR
D: grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness. The head sails away as the laughter receded.
C: WISEMAN JOHN
D: Now. Will thou quest for the Necronomicon?

D: through Ash's shoe.
C: ASH
D: jerks his leg upward in pain. Ash dances about the place hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
C: ASH
D: awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes. Directly above him, on the edge of a table... TINY ASHES #4 AND #5 suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs. TINY ASH #7 AND #8 stand atop Ash's face. They push from either side of his nostrils, plugging his nose. Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for air. As he inhales... SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6 is released. TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
C: ASH
D: inhales the living beast whole. He chokes violently. He breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath. He puts his finger down his throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no avail. He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are gone. He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to a chair. He goes pale.
C: ASH
D: Nasty little thing's inside me. He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain. Well let's see how you like a little hot water! He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding contents painfully down his throat. He sets down the kettle and waits for a moment. A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach

C: ASH
D: Dear God, it's growing bigger! THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER. It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil incarnate. He is now a man with two heads!
