M: Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day
N: Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The Chronicle." He reads the society page. A man enters and leans across his desk.
C: MAN
D: Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants to see you.
N: He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into Madison's office. Interior: Madison's Office, Day Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk.
C: MADISON
D: Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called Willie Stark?
C: JACK
D: No. Who'd he shoot?
C: MADISON
D: Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or something like that.
C: JACK
D: What's so special about him?
C: MADISON
D: They say he's an honest man. What I want you to do is to hop into your car...
C: JACK
D: Why, you promised me a vacation.
C: MADISON
D: Well, that can wait.
C: JACK
D: Yeah... but there's a... a girl I know.
N: He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison a photograph of Anne Stanton.
C: MADISON
D: Oh... Well, she can wait too.
N: Jack takes the paper back and looks at it.
C: JACK
D: The question is... can I?
C: MADISON
D: The answer is... get up there.
C: JACK
D: Right. Oh... uh... what did you say his name was?
E: starts to go
C: MADISON
D: Who?
C: JACK
D: The fellow's name.
C: MADISON
D: Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie Stark.
N: Madison goes on with his work.
C: JACK
D: Willie Stark...
E: as he leaves
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Exterior: Kanoma City, Day As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town.
C: JACK
D: I found him in Kanoma City. A typical, hot, dusty, backwoods county seat.
E: voice over
N: He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking.
C: WILLIE
D: ...to lie to them in order to line their own dirty pockets with the taxpayers' money. When have the citizens of Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this? Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure I'm not elected county treasurer? Well, I'll tell you why...
N: A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break up the gathering. Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills.
C: WILLIE
D: ...Because they're afraid of the truth... and the truth is this. They're trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said steal. The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. They're interested in welfare, sure. But it's their own. Let's look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures. That brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners. That same brick factory uses convict labor.
N: The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd.
C: SHERIFF
D: Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move on.
C: WILLIE
D: Why?
C: SHERIFF
D: City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: more than five people congregating is disturbing the peace.
C: WILLIE
D: If you folks'll be so kind as to read these handbills, my boy will pass them out among you.
E: ignores him
C: SHERIFF
D: There's an ordinance against that too.
C: WILLIE
D: Pass 'em out, Tom.
E: his face grim
N: The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of his hand. Willie jumps down off the platform.
C: WILLIE
D: Let him alone!
N: The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform snapping a picture.
C: SHERIFF
D: Get that camera! Willie, you're under arrest.
E: to deputy
N: He takes Willie by the arm and leads him away. The crowd follows them to the courthouse. Tiny Duffy wipes the sweat off his neck and goes back into the poolroom.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Interior: Kanoma City Poolroom, Day Two of Duffy's men, Pillsbury and a local commissioner, are playing pool as Jack enters.
C: JACK
D: Where can I find Tiny Duffy?
C: PILLSBURY
D: Right over there, mister.
N: He walks over to Duffy. Some townspeople, who followed him there, gather around him to listen.
C: JACK
D: Uh, they told me I could get my camera back here.
C: DUFFY
D: Who told you that?
C: JACK
D: People. Can I?
C: DUFFY
D: You the reporter that's been snoopin' around town?
C: JACK
D: Are you Tiny Duffy?
C: DUFFY
D: What paper?
C: JACK
D: Chronicle.
C: DUFFY
D: You sure come a long way to stick your nose into other people's business.
C: JACK
D: That's true... Only my boss on the paper can't see it that way.
C: DUFFY
D: It ain't any of his business either.
C: JACK
D: Whose business is it?
C: PILLSBURY
D: Them as is tendin' to it. County commissioners that the voters of Kanoma County elected to tend to their business and not take no buttin' in from nobody.
C: JACK
D: You a commissioner?
C: PILLSBURY
D: Yeah. Name's Pillsbury. Dolph Pillsbury.
C: 2ND COMMISSIONER
D: Me too. I'm a commissioner too.
C: JACK
D: Who isn't a commissioner?
C: DUFFY
D: He's the head man.
C: JACK
D: Then you're in a position to know where --
E: to Pillsbury
C: DUFFY
D: He's in a position to know nothin'. And to say nothin'.
C: JACK
D: I thought you said he was head man?
C: DUFFY
D: He uses my head.
E: smiling
C: PILLSBURY
D: Oh, Tiny, you're a card... Ain't he a card? Yeah, he's a card... Now, who thought up those city ordinances about arresting someone for making a speech?
E: laughing loudly
C: DUFFY
D: Who's arrested? Nobody's been arrested. Hi, Willie.
E: looks toward the door
N: Willie enters, accompanied by the sheriff and his deputy. The others in the room, including Sugar Boy in his bartender's apron, step aside to let him pass through.
C: PILLSBURY
D: Hi, Willie.
C: DUFFY
D: Did you apologize to Willie?
E: to Sheriff
C: SHERIFF
D: Yeah, I apologized to Willie.
E: mumbles
C: DUFFY
D: Did you give him his handbills back?
C: SHERIFF
D: Yeah, I gave 'em back.
C: DUFFY
D: Give him back his flag and his bag and... give this man his camera.
E: points to Jack
C: WILLIE
D: I'm going to be on that same street corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.
C: DUFFY
D: You go right ahead, Willie. We all believe in free speech. We got to... it's in the Constitution.
C: WILLIE
D: My boy is out distributing those handbills now.
C: DUFFY
D: It's a free country, Willie. If you can convince the people to vote for you... you go right ahead.
C: WILLIE
D: What did you want to see me about, Mr. Duffy?
C: DUFFY
D: I wanted you to meet a fella came all the way up from the state capital to meet you. A reporter. Wants to write you up... maybe put your picture in the paper.
C: WILLIE
D: I'm happy to know you, sir.
E: turns to Jack
C: JACK
D: Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can we go somewhere where we can talk?
C: DUFFY
D: Now that ain't polite. Don't you want to hear both sides of the story?
N: Jack examines the camera that has just been returned to him.
C: JACK
D: I know your side. What happened to the plate your men took from my camera?
E: finds the plate missing
C: DUFFY
D: Must have dropped out. Oh, come on, fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day... Hey, Sugar Boy...
C: SUGAR BOY
D: Yeah?
C: DUFFY
D: Bring some cold beer for the boys.
C: WILLIE
D: None for me, thank you kindly.
C: PILLSBURY
D: Now you know Willie don't drink, Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking. And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't you, Willie?
C: WILLIE
D: I'll have some orange pop if you don't mind.
N: Duffy roars with laughter.
C: DUFFY
D: Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy. Bring him some orange pop.
C: SUGAR BOY
D: Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out.
E: stutters
C: DUFFY
D: Did you hear that, boys? The p-p- pop's s-s-sold out.
N: They all laugh.
C: PILLSBURY
D: Now ain't he a card?
C: WILLIE
D: He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you... you don't say anything. Let's go, mister.
E: his face hard to Jack
N: They turn and go out.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Exterior: Dirt Road, Day Jack is driving Willie home to his farmhouse. They pass a farmer and his family walking by the side of the road. Willie smiles and waves to them. Exterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day As the car pulls into the drive we see Pa Stark in his rocking chair on the porch, and Lucy, who stands at the top of the steps, waiting to welcome Willie.
C: WILLIE
D: This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.
E: as they go up the steps
C: JACK AND LUCY
D: How do you do?
C: WILLIE
D: That's my pa.
N: Jack reaches out to shake his hand.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night Willie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a napkin, and pushes his plate back.
C: WILLIE
D: Now we'll talk.
N: Camera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated around the dinner table.
C: JACK
D: You've been talking for a long time, Mr. Stark.
C: PAPPY
D: Willie's got a lot to say.
C: LUCY
D: You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have a nap?
C: PAPPY
D: No, I want to hear it.
N: Lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen.
C: LUCY
D: I'm worried about Tom. It's getting dark. He should have been home.
C: WILLIE
D: He's a strong boy. Don't worry about him. He can take care of himself.
C: JACK
D: How old is the boy?
C: WILLIE
D: Fifteen.
C: JACK
D: How long have you been married?
C: WILLIE
D: Nine years.
N: Willie grins at Jack's look of surprise. Lucy comes back into the room.
C: LUCY
D: He was a neighbor's boy. They were poor folks. Both died. I couldn't have any children, so... He's a good boy.
E: laughs
C: WILLIE
D: Oh, he's the best. I couldn't love him any more if he was my own flesh and blood.
C: JACK
D: And now you, Mrs. Stark?
E: to Lucy
C: LUCY
D: Oh, there isn't very much to tell about me.
C: JACK
D: How did you meet?
C: LUCY
D: I was teaching school and one day a pupil walked in. It was Willie. I couldn't have a grown man in the class and Willie wanted to learn so badly... so I married him.
C: JACK
D: Is that the only reason?
C: LUCY
D: Except that I loved him.
E: pressing Willie's arm
C: WILLIE
D: Get the coffee, Lucy.
N: She goes back into the kitchen.
C: JACK
D: When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?
C: LUCY
D: A couple of weeks ago. I'd been teaching for a long time and nobody ever said I wasn't all right. But I don't care. I don't want to teach in a schoolhouse that they built just so somebody can steal some money. And Willie doesn't want to be Treasurer, either, if he has to associate with those dishonest people.
E: as she serves the coffee
C: WILLIE
D: I'm going to run. They can't keep me from running.
E: glumly
C: JACK
D: If you don't mind the truth, Mr. Stark, you haven't much of a chance.
C: WILLIE
D: I'm going to run. They're not going to kick me around like I was dirt.
C: LUCY
D: I don't care if Willie loses... just so he gets the truth to the people. Isn't that true, Willie?
N: Willie is silent. Jack looks at him.
C: LUCY
D: Isn't it, Willie?
C: WILLIE
D: Hmmm?... Yeah, yeah, sure, that's right.
C: LUCY
D: Well, if you lose you can give a little more time to studying your law books.
C: JACK
D: Oh, you studying law too?
C: WILLIE
D: By myself, at night.
C: PAPPY
D: Willie's a smart boy.
C: WILLIE
D: If I ever find the time I'm going to take a course at the university.
N: The door opens slowly and Tom comes in from the porch. His clothes are torn and his face is dirty and bloody. He still carries some of the handbills. They rise to their feet and cluster around him.
C: LUCY
D: What happened, Tommy boy? What's the matter?
C: TOM
D: I gave out the handbills, Pa.
E: head down, muttering
C: WILLIE
D: Speak up. Speak up.
C: LUCY
D: Let him tell it his own way. Go on, Tommy.
C: TOM
D: This time they were waiting for me. They took them away from me. Threw them in the dirt and beat me up. I brought some of them back.
C: WILLIE
D: Good boy. Have you eaten yet, Tom?
E: pats him on the back
C: LUCY
D: Let him wash up first.
N: As Tom and Pappy go into the other room, a rock comes crashing through the front window, shattering the glass. Willie, his face filled with anger, throws open the door and stalks out onto the porch. Jack stands at the door, watching Willie shout into the darkness around him.
C: WILLIE
D: I'm going to run... and you're not going to stop me. I'm gonna run even if I don't get a single vote.

E: laughing
C: JUDGE
D: Good to see you, boy. Very good.
C: JACK
D: Good to see you, Judge. How have you been? What have you been doing?
N: They walk back together to the patio tables.
C: JUDGE
D: Oh, just sitting here... waiting for all of you to come home. You know, when a man starts to get old his eyes stray and play funny tricks on him. As I watched you in that boat I thought sure I saw a boy of twelve with a fishing rod in his hands. And I was sure the first thing he'd say would be...
N: Jack catches sight of Anne Stanton walking down the path. He runs to meet her. As they embrace, he looks back at the Judge.

N: He kisses her, and they turn and walk away.

C: JACK
D: Thank you, Mother. Thank you very much.
C: MRS. BURDEN
D: Monty, Anne and I have been discussing Jack's career. What do you think he ought to go in for? Shall he be a lawyer, doctor...
N: Jack looks at Anne.
C: ANNE
D: We were just discussing whether you should...
C: JACK
D: I like what I'm doing, Mother.
E: to his mother
C: MCEVOY
D: You do very well at it. I read your articles about this fellow... Willie Stark. Very convincing... Too convincing for my tastes.
C: JACK
D: A lot of people like them.
C: MCEVOY
D: A lot of people are fools. Articles like that shouldn't be permitted. They only tend to incite people.
C: JACK
D: What are you afraid of?
C: STANTON
D: I thought they were very good. I was proud of you, Jack. I was particularly interested in Stark's ideas on health and medicine. You know the conditions at the hospital I work in. They're intolerable. I'd like to meet this Willie Stark. He sounds like an honest man.
C: MCEVOY
D: Honest man? This state is full of these log-cabin Abe Lincolns with price tags on them. The louder he yells the higher his price.
C: JACK
D: You think you can buy anything, don't you?
C: MCEVOY
D: Yes, don't you?
N: There is a silence. Then McEvoy turns to the Judge.
C: MCEVOY
D: What do you think, Judge?
C: JUDGE
D: I think this state could stand a few changes.
C: MCEVOY
D: Well, I'll tell you what I think --
E: his face white
C: ANNE
D: Oh, please... let's not talk politics.
E: quickly
C: MRS. BURDEN
D: Anne is right. I absolutely forbid any more of it. I know what we need, we need another toast. You propose it, Monty... you're so good at it.
E: to the Judge
N: The Judge picks up his glass and stands up.
C: JUDGE
D: To the young people... to Anne, to Jack, to Adam... To what lies before them. To the world they'll make... in spite of the mistakes we've made.
C: MCEVOY
D: The mistakes you've made, not me. You're all still pretty high and mighty, aren't you? You all think this state needs a change. You don't like the way it's run. Well, who's going to run it? Willie Stark? The Judge? You? You can be bought too. As a matter of fact you have been. And with my money.
E: rising to Jack
N: Jack's answer is to throw his liquor in his stepfather's face. There is a pause. McEvoy wipes the liquor off with his handkerchief.
C: MCEVOY

D: I've got to live with him.
C: JACK
D: Well, I don't. Neither do you. You don't love him, Mother. You never did.
C: MRS. BURDEN
D: Son, don't spoil anything now... He can help you.
C: JACK
D: I can get along without him. You need this house. And the parties. And the cars and the clothes and the lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother, face it. For once in your life, face it.
N: Mrs. Burden appeals to Anne.
C: MRS. BURDEN
D: Anne, please... please make him understand.
N: Anne says nothing. Mrs. Burden goes back into the house.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Interior: Stanton Living Room, Night Anne and Jack sit alone in the room, beneath the portrait of the old Governor Stanton.
C: JACK
D: Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on the moon. It isn't real. It doesn't exist. It's me pretending I live on what I earn. It's my mother trying to keep herself young, and drinking herself old doing it. It's you and Adam living in this house as though your father were still alive. It's an old man like the Judge dreaming of the past... Anne, come away with me.
C: ANNE
D: And do what?
C: JACK
D: And live in a shack and eat red beans. Anne, what do you want me to do?
E: rises impatiently
C: ANNE
D: Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven't been sure. You've gone from one thing to the other... a year at law school, and now this job as a reporter...
C: JACK
D: Are you afraid I can't make a living?
C: ANNE
D: Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that. I don't care about the money. It... it's just that I... I want you to be something.
C: JACK
D: What is it you want me to be?
C: ANNE
D: I don't know. It's just that I want you to be... to do... something important.
N: Jack looks up at the portrait of Governor Stanton.
C: JACK
D: Like your father. All right. I'll run for governor. Anne, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said that.
E: pause
C: ANNE
D: All right, Jack. I'll go away with you. I'll do anything you want me to do.
N: They kiss.
C: JACK
D: Anne, I've wanted you to say that more than anything in the world, and now that you've said it... Anne, I guess you were right. I'm not sure of anything, including myself. I'm not sure I could live up to the... Anne, wait for me. Please wait for me.

C: WILLIE
D: My friends... I...
N: He tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before his eyes with both hands. Then he lifts his head, and looks directly at the people who have come to hear him. As he speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience, Willie's people.
C: WILLIE
D: I have a speech here. It's a speech about what this state needs. There's no need in my telling you what this state needs. You are the state and you know what you need... You over there... look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger?... And you, what about your crops? Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market?... And you. What about your kids? Are they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause there's no school for them?... No, I'm not going to read you any speech.
N: He throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed.

D: ...So get ready to laugh.
C: SADIE
D: What's he up to?
C: JACK
D: Shut up!
C: WILLIE
D: Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's about a hick... a hick like you, if you please. Yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and gully washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast... and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some... for himself, and for folks like him.
N: Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's speech.
C: WILLIE
D: No, I'm not going to lie to you. He didn't start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them. No. No, he started off thinking of number one. But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people. That's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics... rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that... So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor...
N: Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm.
C: JACK
D: Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful...
N: Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his face filled with conviction, and with fury.
C: WILLIE
D: ...So they told the hick... and he swallowed it. He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he'd like to try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped pants... they saw the hick and they took him in.
N: He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak to him.
C: DUFFY
D: Willie, what are you trying to do?
E: low voice
N: Willie turns on him, roaring.

D: Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you. Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah, you're hicks too, and they fooled you a thousand times, just like they fooled me. But this time I'm going to fool somebody. I'm going to stay in this race. I'm on my own and I'm out for blood.

C: JACK
D: Adam, you know how rumors start...
C: WILLIE
D: Yes. Yes, that's true. I have nothing to hide. I'll make a deal with the devil if it'll help me carry out my program. But believe me, there are no strings attached to those deals.
C: STANTON
D: You're sure about that?
C: WILLIE
D: Doc, Jack here has been telling me how you feel about things... how you'd like to see a new hospital built, a hospital that's the biggest and best that money can buy. You want those things, Doc, because, well, because you're a man who wants to do good. Now, I'd like to ask you a question.
C: STANTON
D: Shoot.
N: The guests laugh good-naturedly.
C: WILLIE
D: Do you know what good comes out of?
C: STANTON
D: You tell me, Mr. Stark.
C: WILLIE
D: Out of bad... that's what good comes out of. Because you can't make it out of anything else. You didn't know that, did you?
C: STANTON
D: No, I didn't... There's another question I'd like to ask you. You say there's only bad to start with and the good must come with the bad. Who's to determine what's good and what's bad?... You?
C: WILLIE
D: Why not?
C: STANTON
D: How?
C: WILLIE
D: Why, that's easy. Just... just make it up as you go along.

D: Folks, there's a time to talk and there's a time to act. I think the time to act is right now. And with your support, I not only will win but I will do all of the things I promised. I need your help. Oh, I need it badly. But I'm not going to beg for it. In the name of this state which we love... in the name of the governor in whose house we meet... I demand it.

C: WILLIE
D: But a game one.
N: They laugh.
C: WILLIE
D: Look, I'll give you complete power as attorney general. You can do anything you see fit. I'll swing the ax to clear the way for you. Is that a deal?
N: The Judge smiles, then puts out his hand.

The crowd erupts into cheers as he steps outside.
C: WILLIE
D: This is not a time for speechmaking. I should get on my knees and ask God to give me strength to carry out your will.
E: raises his hands for silence
N: Loud cheers. Adam watches Anne. She applauds. Willie looks down at the crowd and continues his speech.
C: WILLIE
D: This much I swear to you. These things you shall have. I'm going to build a hospital. The biggest that money can buy... and it will belong to you. That any man, woman, or child who is sick or in pain can go through those doors and know that everything will be done for them that man can do. To heal sickness. To ease pain. Free. Not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right that every child shall have a complete education. That any man who produces anything can take it to market without paying toll. And no poor man's land or farm can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people that they will not be deprived of hope...
N: The crowd applauds, and Willie waves. We see Anne, face aglow, turn to Jack.

N: She goes to the door to yell to the secretary.
C: SADIE
D: I hate all women.
N: She slams the door again, and returns to her desk.
C: SADIE
D: Was she pretty?
N: Jack shoves the paper at her. She ignores it.
C: SADIE
D: Was she pretty?
C: JACK
D: If I met her on the street I'd never recognize her.
C: SADIE
D: Was she pretty?
C: JACK
D: How should I know? I wasn't looking at her face... Look, if it's going to cause all this grief, why don't you let him go?
C: SADIE
D: Let him go? I'll kill him. I'll drive him out of this state.
C: JACK
D: Just because a guy's sitting with a couple of girls on his knees in public...
C: SADIE
D: Public or private... I know him. How about what happened in Chicago? That girl on skates... and the time you both went to St. Louis... There's a new invention, you know, Photography and newsreels. Willie Stark in a nightclub... Willie Stark with a blonde.
C: JACK
D: You could always bleach your hair.
C: SADIE
D: I could also break every bone in his neck. After all I've done for him... Now he goes two-timing me.
C: JACK
D: He's been two-timing Lucy. So there's another kind of arithmetic for what he's doing to you.
C: SADIE
D: Lucy? If she had her way he'd be back in Kanoma City slopping the hogs right now. And he knows it. He knows what she'd do for him. She had her chance.

C: NEWSMEN
D: Have you heard about Pillsbury? What do you intend to do about Pillsbury? How about it, Governor?

C: WILLIE
D: Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. If the Almighty had intended for you to be rich he'd have taken care of that a long time ago. The idea of you being rich... that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a fact?
N: Pillsbury doesn't answer.
C: WILLIE
D: Answer me!
C: PILLSBURY
D: Yes.
C: WILLIE
D: Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up. Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact.
C: PILLSBURY
D: It's a fact, a blasphemous fact.
N: Sugar Boy laughs loudly. The phone rings and Sadie picks it up.

D: Yeah?... Oh, I see. Dumond can't come. He says his wife is sick.
E: hangs up
C: WILLIE
D: I don't care if she's dying. Sugar, get the car. Get him and bring him over here.
N: Sugar Boy exists. Willie turns back to Pillsbury.
C: WILLIE
D: Now, you know what you're supposed to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're supposed to stay poor and take orders. Oh, there'll be some sweetening for you from time to time... but Duffy'll take care of that. Don't you go setting yourself up on your own again, do you understand that?
C: PILLSBURY
D: Yes.
C: WILLIE
D: Louder, man. And say, I understand that.
C: PILLSBURY
D: I understand that.
C: WILLIE
D: Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie.
N: There is a knock on the door.
C: WILLIE
D: See who that is, Duffy.
N: Judge Stanton enters.
C: WILLIE
D: Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be with you in just a couple of seconds. Now write what I tell you to write... Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign as auditor due to ill health, to take effect as soon as you can relieve me. Respectfully yours. Did you sign it?
E: back to Pillsbury after a pause
C: PILLSBURY

D: Against who?
E: rising
C: JUDGE
D: This time, Pillsbury.
C: WILLIE
D: I got that "this time," Judge.
C: JUDGE
D: How true is it?
C: WILLIE
D: It's too true.
N: The phone rings.
C: SADIE
D: Yes? This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on the wire.
E: hands phone to Willie
N: Willie takes the phone, but puts his hand over the mouthpiece so that he can speak to Jack.
C: WILLIE
D: What have we got on Hopkins, Jack? Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury business... Here's what I want you to do when it comes up in the legislature. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You listen to me. You got a mortgage coming due on that place of yours in about five weeks, haven't you? You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you? All right, Tiny'll talk to you in the morning.
E: as Jack riffles through the black book reads from black book Jack holds out for him still reading from book pause
N: He grins and hangs up the phone.
C: WILLIE
D: Get going, Tiny.
N: Duffy leaves.
C: JUDGE
D: You haven't answered my question. Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide?
C: WILLIE
D: I'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury's hide. It's something much more important than that. If the McMurphy boys get the notion they can get away with this, there's no telling where they'll stop.
C: JUDGE
D: Or where you will... Pillsbury is guilty. As attorney general of this state, it's my job to prosecute.
E: quietly
C: WILLIE
D: Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was... was human. He isn't. He's a thing. You don't prosecute an adding machine if the spring goes busted and makes a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed him. I'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury. It's something much bigger than that.
C: JUDGE
D: Yes, it is.
E: getting up
C: JACK
D: He's right, Judge. Can't you see that he's right?
C: JUDGE
D: He's right because you want him to be right. Because you're afraid to admit you've made a mistake. Do it now before it's too late. I'm offering my resignation as attorney general. You'll have it in writing by messenger in the morning... dated.
E: to Willie
C: WILLIE
D: It took you a long time to make up your mind, Judge. A long time. What made you take such a long time?
E: softly
C: JUDGE
D: I wasn't sure.
C: WILLIE
D: And now you are?
N: The Judge nods.
C: WILLIE
D: I'll tell you what you are. You're scared. You sat in that big easy chair of yours for thirty years and played at being a judge. Then all of a sudden I came along and put a bat in your hand, and I said, go ahead, Judge, start swinging. And you did. And you had a wonderful time. But now you're scared. You don't want to get your hands dirty. You want to pick up the marbles... but you don't want to get your hands dirty. Look at my whole program, Judge. How do you think I put that across?
C: JUDGE
D: I knew how, but I never knew why.
N: He starts to leave.
C: WILLIE
D: You're not by any chance thinking of going over to McMurphy's boys, are you?
C: JUDGE
D: I'm through with politics.
C: WILLIE
D: I'm happy to hear that. No hard feelings.
E: extends his hand
C: JUDGE
D: Goodbye, Governor. Are you coming with me, Jack?
E: ignores the hand to Jack
N: Jack turns away.
C: JUDGE
D: You're making a mistake.
N: He goes. Willie closes the door behind him.
C: WILLIE
D: Do you think he means it when he says he's through with politics, Sadie?
C: SADIE
D: No. No, I don't.
C: WILLIE
D: What about you, Jack?
C: JACK
D: I've known the Judge all my life. He's always meant everything he's said.

D: What's the matter, Anne?
C: ANNE
D: Please take me home now, Sugar Boy.
C: WILLIE
D: You've got to understand me.
C: ANNE
D: I understand you. It's myself I don't understand.
E: turns away
C: WILLIE
D: Do you think I like sneaking around corners any more than you do? But right now, with the Pillsbury business and with your uncle quitting... If I got a divorce...
C: ANNE
D: Maybe we'd better stop seeing each other.
C: WILLIE
D: No. No, we won't stop seeing each other, will we?
C: ANNE
D: No.
E: slowly

D: Anne, I want to ask you a question. Was the Judge ever broke? Really broke?
C: ANNE
D: Why do you want to know?
C: JACK
D: I don't want to know, but I've got to.
C: ANNE
D: Did he tell you --
C: JACK
D: Did who tell me?
C: ANNE
D: I don't know. I... how should I know if the Judge was ever broke?
N: She walks away from him. Adam enters, carrying bundles of food and two wine bottles.
C: STANTON
D: Hello... Come on, Anne, take this food and start cooking. I'm hungry.
N: Anne takes the grocery bundles. Jack grabs the wine.
C: JACK
D: Me, I'm on the thirsty side. Bring some glasses, Anne, quick.
N: He joins Adam, who has opened the piano.
C: STANTON
D: It's been a long time since I played this thing. What do you say we wake up the ghosts, huh?
E: laughing
C: JACK
D: Another glass, Anne, for a ghost.
E: calling to Anne
C: STANTON
D: Remember the last time I played this? You and Anne were dancing?
E: starting to play
N: Anne returns with three glasses. Jack grabs her around the waist and whirls her around.
C: JACK
D: Shall we dance?
C: ANNE
D: Let's... let's have a drink first.
N: Adam starts to pour the wine.
C: JACK
D: No, no... keep playing. Anne and I want to hear this, don't we, Anne? Adam... ghost... and me.
E: Jack pours the wine
C: STANTON
D: What shall we drink to?
C: JACK
D: To the ghost?... To Adam, to the director of the new medical center.
C: STANTON
D: Don't you ever stop working for him?
E: bangs the piano keys
C: ANNE
D: Adam!
C: STANTON
D: I came up here to get away...
C: JACK
D: I'm sorry, Adam.
C: ANNE
D: Well, I'm not. What's wrong with being the director of the new medical center?
C: STANTON
D: Nothing, except that I'm not going to take it.
C: JACK
D: Why? Because your uncle resigned?
C: STANTON
D: That's partly it. There are other things.
C: ANNE
D: What other things?
C: STANTON
D: You too?
E: looks at her
C: ANNE
D: Yes, me too.
C: JACK
D: Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss it, let's not.
C: STANTON
D: All right, let's discuss it.
C: ANNE
D: But calmly.
C: STANTON
D: Calmly. Go ahead, Jack. Why do you think he wants me?
C: JACK
D: Because you're the best man for the job.
C: STANTON
D: It could have nothing to do with my name being Stanton?
C: JACK
D: It could have. Let's grant that.
C: STANTON
D: That's your answer.
C: JACK
D: No, it's not. If that were the only answer I wouldn't be with him any more. There's another side of it. I've learned something from him. You can't make an omelet without cracking eggs.
C: STANTON
D: Or heads.
C: ANNE
D: But at least a hospital will be built, and the sick will be cared for.
C: STANTON
D: At what price?
C: JACK
D: At any price.
C: STANTON
D: Do you really believe that, Jack?
C: JACK
D: I really believe that Stark wants to do good. You do too. It's a matter of method. Many times out of evil comes good. Well, pain is an evil. As a doctor you should know that.
C: STANTON
D: Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It is not evil in itself. Stark is evil.
C: JACK
D: The people of the state don't think so.
C: STANTON
D: How would they know? The first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. Why be so afraid of criticism? If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth. I don't see how you can separate the two. No, Stark is not for me.
C: ANNE
D: No, Stark is not for you. Well, what is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all it is... foolish, stupid pride. All you've ever talked about is what you could do if... if somebody would tear down and build. All right, all right, somebody has, and he's given it to you. But he's not for you. No, he's not for you.
E: upset
N: She throws down her glass and runs crying from the room. Adam goes after her.
C: STANTON
D: Anne... Anne...
N: Interior: Stanton Hallway and Stairs, Night Anne runs upstairs and Adam follows. The Judge comes out of his room to see what has happened, sees Jack standing at the foot of the stairs, hesitates a moment, and then goes back to his room without speaking.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Interior: County Recorder Room, Day Jack enters and speaks to a clerk, who then directs him to one of the files. He starts to look through the files marked MORTGAGES DEFAULTED.
C: JACK
D: Will I find anything, Judge? Will I? I didn't find it all at once. It takes a long time to go through old courthouse records and musty deeds... a very long time. But it wasn't too hard for me. I was well trained in research, especially this kind.
E: voice over
N: He pulls out a file.
C: JACK
D: I found what I didn't want to find.
E: voice over
N: He takes the file back to the clerk.
C: JACK
D: Have some photostat copies made of these. I'll be back tomorrow for them.

N: She comes in, sniffs the air.
C: SADIE
D: Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot of whisky. You sober?
C: JACK
D: Stone.
C: SADIE
D: I'll have one with you. What are you hiding out for?
E: starts tidying up the room
C: JACK
D: I'm not. I've been sleeping.
C: SADIE
D: For four days? You've been back in town for four days.
C: JACK
D: Willie knows everything.
C: SADIE
D: Willie's worried about his boy.
C: JACK
D: Willie's boy is worried about Willie's boy.
C: SADIE
D: Well, why don't you put something on the phonograph -- a low-down, mean blues. Play it over and over again until you're sick of it. Then crack it and go back to work. I do it all the time.
E: sits down
C: JACK
D: That's not my problem.
C: SADIE
D: No, it isn't your problem. I'll wait for you if you want to powder your nose.
E: gets up again
N: Jack goes into the bathroom.
C: JACK
D: I'll be with you in a minute.
N: Sadie wanders around. She goes to the dresser, upon which is a photograph of Anne Stanton. She picks up the picture and places it so she can see it in the mirror and compare it with her own reflection.
C: SADIE
D: Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got to look in the mirror to be able to see it. Soft, white skin... not like mine. I had smallpox when I was a kid. Where I lived it seemed nearly all the kids had smallpox...
E: runs her hand across her cheeks
N: Jack watches her through the open bathroom door.
C: SADIE
D: It leaves your face hard. Then she's got poise. Look at the way she holds her head... at just the right angle. That takes training. That takes years of training...
N: Jack, towel in hand, comes out and stands behind her. He looks at her in the mirror, puzzled.
C: SADIE
D: I see what Willie sees. Willie's got big ideas, Jack.
C: JACK
D: What do you mean?
C: SADIE
D: A girl like that could be a governor's wife. Or even a President's.
C: JACK
D: What are you talking about?
C: SADIE
D: He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and he'll ditch you.
C: JACK
D: Answer me!
E: shaking her
C: SADIE
D: He'll ditch everybody in the whole world because that's what Willie wants. Nobody in the world but him.
C: JACK
D: What are you talking about?
C: SADIE
D: You and your high-tone friends. What do they know? What do they know about anything? Why did you have to mix her in?
C: JACK
D: You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of your mind.
C: SADIE
D: Am I? Well, why don't you go down and ask her. Or ask him. Ask Willie.
C: JACK
D: Shut up!
C: SADIE
D: Go ahead, ask him.
C: JACK
D: Shut up!
C: SADIE
D: Ask him!
N: He slaps her hard.

D: Yeah, I'm sure.
C: WILLIE
D: You're going to keep trying, aren't you?

E: looks at him closely
C: JACK
D: What else do you want me to do?
E: avoiding it
C: WILLIE
D: If you've got something on your mind, boy, spit it out. We've been together too long to play games.
C: JACK
D: What do you want me to do?
C: WILLIE
D: I hear your pal Adam Stanton turned down the job as director of the hospital. That's bad. Especially at a time like this.
C: JACK
D: Oh? How did you hear it?
C: WILLIE
D: Why? What difference does it make?
C: JACK
D: I just wanted to know.
C: WILLIE

C: COACH
D: I don't care if he is your son, Governor... No special rules for him.
C: TOM
D: It doesn't make any difference to me either way... whether I play or not.
C: WILLIE
D: Well, it does to me. What do you want him to do?
E: to coach
C: COACH
D: To behave himself. Like the rest of the boys. Four times this season he's broken training. He comes on the practice field half potted.
C: WILLIE
D: Tom, you're going to have to obey the rules. Do you hear me? You're going to obey the rules.
C: TOM
D: I put 'em across, don't I? Every Saturday I put 'em across and I can still do it, drunk or sober. That's all you want, isn't it... for me to put 'em across so you can big-shot it around? Isn't that all you want?

E: to Adam
C: STANTON
D: What are you trying to convince me of? I've taken the job.
C: WILLIE
D: Why?
C: STANTON
D: My reasons are my own. Why are you building a hospital?
C: WILLIE
D: To do some good for the people of the state.
C: STANTON
D: And get some votes.
C: WILLIE
D: Oh, there are lots of ways to get votes.
C: STANTON
D: Yes, I know... I won't stand for any interference.
C: WILLIE
D: I won't interfere. I may fire you, but I won't interfere.
C: STANTON
D: If that's a threat, you're wasting your time. You know what I think of your administration.

D: Yes, I know. I'll tell you what... You stay on your side of the fence; I'll stay on mine. Is that a deal?

T: FADE OUT FADE IN:
N: Interior: Projection Room, Day Willie, Jack, and Sugar Boy are watching a newsreel, similar in style to the March of Time newsreels. A producer, his assistant, and two policemen are also in the room.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: And so the eyes of the entire nation are now focused upon Governor Willie Stark, an amazing phenomenon on the American political scene. The whole state is filled with his accomplishments -- each of them, of course, bearing his personal signature, to make sure that no one will ever forget who gave them to the state.
N: MONTAGE: THE NEWSREEL Large plaque on side of the highway: THIS BRIDGE WAS BUILT DURING THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNOR STARK. A TOLL BRIDGE STOOD HERE FOR FIFTY YEARS... NOW THE PEOPLE TRAVEL FREE Camera pans to shot of the bridge. Plaque over college entrance: STARK COLLEGE... THAT EVERY MAN, WOMAN, OR CHILD, RICH OR POOR, SHALL HAVE AN EDUCATION... WILLIE STARK Shot of library -- lettering reads WILLIE STARK LIBRARY. KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE Shot of bad road running through dry, barren land.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: This is the way the roads used to be. But there are those who claim that they were adequate for the people's needs, that you don't need a four- or six-lane highway for a horse and buggy.
N: Shot of horse pulling a plow. The empty, untraversed STARK HIGHWAY.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: When Stark boasts of his great school system, his critics say: you can't go to school and work in the fields at the same time. And they question the benefit of these projects, charging that the need and the poverty of the people is as great as before.
N: Shot of large school. Camera cuts to men working in the field, then to ramshackle barn, and to a farmer walking across his rotted cornfield.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: Willie Stark has never forgotten the source of his power: the people who supported him.
N: Willie talking to the farmers.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: He still keeps in touch with these people of the backwoods, making periodic trips to such places as Kanoma City, now famous as his birthplace...
N: Willie's official car and escort speeding through a street. Sign reads: KANOMA CITY, BIRTHPLACE OF WILLIE STARK Shot of Willie having his picture taken with Lucy and Pappy on the porch of the old farm. Willie mending the fence on the farm. Willie feeding the pigs.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: For those who say that Willie Stark is a man of destiny, there are others who claim that he is a man of evil, a man who cares neither for the people nor the state, but only for his own personal power and ambition.
N: Willie making a speech to a huge crowd of cheering people. Willie inspecting his police force. Willie pounding the desk in the state legislature.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: Obviously, these ambitions go far beyond the boundaries of the state. Just how far, only time will tell. Meanwhile, he is here...
N: Big close-up of Willie as he delivers a speech.
C: NARRATOR'S VOICE
D: ...and from the looks of things, he is here to stay. Willie Stark: messiah or dictator?
N: The picture goes off and the lights in the room come on.
C: PRODUCER
D: How do you like it, Governor?
N: Willie stands and faces the producer.
C: WILLIE
D: How many theaters will this play in?
C: PRODUCER
D: All over the country.
C: WILLIE
D: Hear that, Jack. All over the country.
N: They start to leave. Willie stops for a moment.
C: WILLIE
D: Oh, there's one thing in there I didn't like too well. That messiah or dictator.
C: PRODUCER
D: That's our point of view, Governor. And that's the way it stands.
N: There is a silence. Willie's face is hard. Then he grins.
C: WILLIE
D: All right, all right, that's the way it stands... as of now.

C: WILLIE
D: Hello, Lucy... How are you making it, Pa?... How are you, Tom?
N: Tom doesn't answer. Lucy offers her cheek to Willie. Sadie, Jack, and Sugar Boy wait at the bottom of the steps, along with the reporters.

N: Tom starts to wheel toward Willie, but Lucy restrains him.
C: ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
D: The ugly charge of "official murder" has been hurled at the administration by a coalition of Stark's opponents, led by Judge Stanton, lately an outspoken critic of the administration.
C: WILLIE
D: Your friend, the Judge.
E: to Jack
C: ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
D: Thus an almost forgotten incident provided the spark that might set off the explosion needed to rock Willie Stark out of power. The latest report is that impeachment proceedings may be instituted...

C: SADIE
D: Yes, Governor.
N: She leaves.
C: TOM
D: Now he needs us. Now that he's in trouble he needs us, so he can lead us around like monkeys with rings in our noses. So he can say to people, look at me, feel sorry for me... just a family man with a wife and a crippled son...

N: They cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE -- GOVERNOR STARK.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Do you hear me... stay where you are. Don't go away. Stay where you are. Don't go away.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Exterior: State Capitol, Night Newsmen, photographers stand about, bored. The crowd, every bit as large, is quiet but expectant. Everyone holds still as the announcer's voice is heard again.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Attention, please. Attention, please. The balloting on the impeachment proceedings against Governor Stark has just ended. This is the result: Willie Stark has won.
N: The crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers. Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through. Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all. Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed crowd.
C: WILLIE
D: They tried to ruin me. But they are ruined. They tried to ruin me because they did not like what I have done. Do you like what I have done?
N: Loud applause, and cries of "yes."
C: WILLIE
D: Remember, it's not I who have won, but you. Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and I shall live in your right and your will. And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break him. I'll break him with my bare hands. For I have the strength of many.
N: Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack and comes down the steps to greet him.
C: WILLIE
D: Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're here. I knew you'd come back.
N: He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.
C: WILLIE
D: Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see you.
N: Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, forcing them back.
C: COP
D: Stand back, everybody. Stand back.
N: Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar, looking down on him.
C: SUGAR BOY
D: D-does it hurt m-much, boss? D-d- does it hurt much?
E: nearly crying
N: Jack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming mob to get to Adam. She looks at Adam for a moment, then turns away.
C: JACK
D: Anne, Anne... Where are you going?
N: She doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and catches hold of her arm.
C: ANNE
D: I don't know. Leave me alone.
C: JACK
D: To do what?
C: ANNE
D: I don't care.
C: JACK
D: No, that's too easy.
C: ANNE
D: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
C: JACK
D: I do.
C: ANNE
D: Leave me alone, please.
C: JACK
D: No, no more.
C: ANNE
D: He's dead.
C: JACK
D: We're alive.
C: ANNE
D: My brother's dead.
C: JACK
D: We've got to go on living.
C: ANNE
D: How?
C: JACK
D: So that Adam's death has meaning, so that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our life has to give his death meaning. Don't you see that? Look at those people...
N: He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still struggling to get a look at Willie.
C: JACK
D: Look at them! They still believe in him. And we've got to make them see Willie the way Adam saw him, or there's no meaning in anything... anything.
N: A policeman approaches.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Mr. Burden... the governor's asking for you. You better hurry. He's going fast.
C: JACK
D: Will you wait here?
E: to Anne
N: No reply.
C: JACK
D: Will you wait here?
N: She nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking down at Willie.
C: WILLIE
D: It could have been the whole world, Willie Stark. The whole world... Willie Stark. Why did he do it to me... Willie Stark? Why?
N: His head droops to the side and he dies.
T: FADE OUT
N: THE END
