Seated on the piano bench, accompanying him, is a woman in a maternity dress: "Isabelle and Nicholas" 2ND PHOTO: A boy of 11, wearing conductor's tails and holding a raised baton in his right hand as if about to gesture a downbeat: "Herbert Kreutzer Dupea" 3RD PHOTO: Another boy of approximately 9, in the act of playing the violin: "Carl Fidelio Dupea" 4TH PHOTO: The two boys are now poised behind the piano. Seated on its bench is a girl of 6, her hands resting on the keyboard. Written beneath: "Elizabeth Partita Dupea" 5TH PHOTO: The above family group, seated on the porch of the Dupea home. All eyes but Isabelle's are faced toward the camera. She beams upon a 3 year-old asleep in her arms, his head resting against her bosom. His figure is encircled by the pen's marking and preceding his name is the configuration of a small heart: "Robert Eroica Dupea"
S: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DUPEA HOME - DAY
N: BACH-VIVALDI OVER: A 7-year-old BOBBY sits in a chair, his feet dangling in absent-minded rhythm to a chamber piece played by his father, his two brothers and his sister. CLOSE ON a metronome, marking a slow etude rhythm. The CAMERA MOVES from it to Bobby, on the piano bench beside his mother. As she patiently demonstrates the etude for him, he places a thumb in his mouth and leans against her arm. ON THE METRONOME at an andante rhythm. CARL and TITA, now in their teens, are seated side by side on the piano bench, playing four-hands with dazzling virtuosity. The CAMERA MOVES from them to a framed newspaper article on the music-room wall. Below a photograph of a 20-year-old young man are the words: "Herbert Kreutzer Dupea - Seattle's Youngest Guest Conductor."
S: INT. RECITAL HALL GREEN ROOM - NIGHT
N: BACH-VIVALDI OVER: Bobby, at 10, wearing a dress suit. His mother combs his hair with maternal concentration. CLOSE-UP of a program announcing a Dupea family recital.

Rondo Alla Turca - Mozart - Played by Elizabeth Dupea. Piano Sonata, Opus 110 - Beethoven - Played by Herbart Dupea. The CAMERA COMES to rest on: Five Easy Pieces - Grebner - Played by Robert Dupea.
S: INT. MORTUARY CHAPEL - DAY
N: Five Easy Pieces, played haltingly OVER the torsos of a line of people moving slowly down the chapel aisle. ANOTHER ANGLE shows a solemn procession of the above, filing by an open casket holding Isabelle Dupea. ON THE FAMILY PEW The CAMERA PANS from NICHOLAS, seated on the aisle, to the four adult children seated next to him and COMES TO REST on Bobby. His gaze is cast down to his lap, as he refuses to look at: The pale profile of his mother's face resting within the satin folds of the casket lining, and... ... as the last of the "family friends" pay their respect: Nicholas steps out into the aisle and, followed by Tita, Carl and HERBERT, moves down toward the casket. Bobby rises from his seat and makes his way toward the aisle, where he hesitates briefly, then turns and walks up the aisle and out the chapel doors. TITLES END
S: EXT. SIGNAL HILL OIL FIELD - DAY
N: TAMMY WYNETTE'S "STAND BY YOUR MAN" OVER: The toothed bucket of a back hoe trenches into the earth, then lifts up into the air, revealing Bobby in hard-hat and heavy gloves, operating the levers. As the hoe swings off to the side and deposits a load of earth into the rear of a truck... ... a SERIES OF SHOTS begins, showing Bobby and a fellow hard-hat (ELTON) engaged in the dirty and dangerous task of working "crew" with a team of TOOL-PUSHERS on the derricks of Signal Hill. Functioning as servants of the well and its pumps, the PULL rods, MAKE and BREAK joints on the rig floor, WELD tubing, CARRY pipes, CLIMB the "tour," and PLAY THE DOZENS on beer wagon breaks.
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - SIGNAL HILL - NIGHT
N: ABOVE SONG OVER: Bobby, still in his hard hat, as he drives. Out through the window, the derricks of the Hill can be seen, their night-work lights on.
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
N: SONG OVER: FOLLOWING ON the car as it moves off the Hill into the seamy districts adjacent to it, passing by fast food joints, liquor stores, all-night porno parlors and neon-lighted bars.
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
N: SONG OVER: ON BOBBY'S FACE: as he stares out through the windshield, his eyes distant, dwelling in an oblivion that blanks both the present and past.
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
N: SONG OVER: The car pulls onto a low-rent residential street and comes to a stop in front of a small bungalow. Bobby exits the car, moves up the walkway to the house and disappears inside.
S: INT. RAYETTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: SONG OVER: Bobby, seated on the couch, a can of beer in hand, staring morosely across the room, to: A PORTABLE STEREO, playing the song:
C: WYNETTE
D: "And if you love him/Oh be proud of him/For after all, he's just a man..."
E: V.O.
N: RAYETTE DIPESTO, in a waitress's uniform with a bowl of beer nuts. After placing them on the coffee table in front of him, she leans down and kisses him. Challenged by a less than reciprocal response, she kisses him more fervently. As she moves her lips from his ear to his neck, he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks.
C: WYNETTE
D: "Stand by your man/And show the world you love him/Keep giving all the love you can/Stand by your man."
E: V.O.
N: The song concludes, and setting aside her ardor for the moment:
C: RAYETTE
D: I'm gonna play it again...
E: Arky accent
N: As she starts for the stereo, he takes hold of her hand.
C: BOBBY
D: You're not going to play it again.
C: RAYETTE
D: Well, lemme play the other side then.
C: BOBBY
D: No.
N: Again, he prevents her from moving to the stereo and pulls her down onto the couch.
C: RAYETTE
D: Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
C: BOBBY
D: You said.
C: RAYETTE
D: Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think... "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
E: she sings
N: He picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it over his ear.
C: RAYETTE
D: Oh, you prick...
N: She pulls it from his hand.
C: RAYETTE
D: How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
C: BOBBY
D: I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
N: She immediately softens and tries to become more "refined."
C: RAYETTE
D: Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself... You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
E: bringing her face close to his
C: BOBBY
D: You're playing the other side.
N: Very hurt, she sits up and looks away from him. He finishes the beer and holds the can out to her.
C: BOBBY
D: Cerveza.
C: RAYETTE
D: Serveza yourself!
E: grabbing it from him
C: BOBBY
D: Now, now.
C: RAYETTE
D: No, dammit, I would easy.
E: she stands up
N: And, as she turns and goes toward the kitchen:
C: BOBBY
D: But you heal fast.
N: Through the open door to the kitchen, Rayette can be seen opening the refrigerator. She takes out a can of beer and returns to Bobby.
C: RAYETTE
D: You can play the piano, an' your whole damn family can play on some type a musical instrument. An' all I'm askin' is for you to listen to my singing for one single little second...
E: over the above
N: She hands him the can and sits back down on the couch.
C: RAYETTE
D: But you think you would? No, you're too damn selfish...
N: He gestures at the name tag on her dress, and, as we'll find he often does, speaks in the Okie-Arky accent he's learned from working the rigs:
C: BOBBY
D: Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
C: RAYETTE
D: Out where?
N: She sits down and begins removing the tag.
C: BOBBY
D: I don't know, I'll holler up Elton an' Stoney...
N: She thinks about it, then moves closer to him and begins unbuttoning his workshirt, as:
C: RAYETTE
D: I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
C: BOBBY
D: You can sing the song.
C: RAYETTE
D: You know what, you are never satisfied.
E: annoyed
C: BOBBY
D: That's right, hand.
N: The response makes her deeply insecure and she immediately lays her body against his...
C: RAYETTE
D: Oh, now, baby...
N: ... and initiates another round of kissing.
S: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Bobby lifts his ball from the return rack, moves to the lane and bowls a perfect strike. Making a self congratulatory gesture of triumph, he turns back to: Elton, seated at the scoring table. His wife, STONEY, is seated beside Rayette on the horseshoe banquette. As he addresses Rayette, we note that Elton's two front teeth are missing.
C: ELTON
D: Your ball, Ray.
E: Okie accent
C: RAYETTE
D: Is this suppose to be fun?
E: reluctant
C: BOBBY
D: Go on, get up there...
N: She rises and moves to the rack.
C: BOBBY
D: ... and stay relaxed this time.
E: CONT'D
N: Picking up ball, she moves to the head of the lane and slings it down the alley, watching hopefully as... ... it rolls off to the right and takes only one pin. ON BOBBY as she moves to her second ball.
C: BOBBY
D: Now don't loft it, just release it like I told you.
N: ON RAYETTE as she bowls the ball down the right-hand rut and comes back to the banquette, apologizing:
C: RAYETTE
D: The ball's too heavy for me, honey...
N: He looks past her to Stoney, about to bowl her ball.
C: BOBBY
D: It's not the damn ball.
N: And as Stoney bowls a strike, Rayette hugs his arm.
C: RAYETTE
D: I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
C: BOBBY
D: No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
N: And as Elton bowls a strike...
C: BOBBY
D: Shit.
E: CONT'D mumbling
N: He gets up and passes Elton on his way to the rack.
C: BOBBY
D: Nice ball, El.
E: CONT'D
N: Rayette, to Stoney as she watches Bobby prepare to bowl:
C: RAYETTE
D: Id'n he somethin' to see?
N: And as he makes another strike and returns to the banquette, she gets up and throws her arms around him. He returns her embrace, smiling over her shoulder at: Two heavily made-up young women (TWINKY and BETTY) taking possession of the adjacent lane. (Note that Betty is of diminutive proportions, while Twinky is Amazonian.)
C: RAYETTE
D: Is it my turn again?
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
N: He remains standing, watching as she throws another gutter ball and then comes back toward him, alibi ing:
C: RAYETTE
D: I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
C: BOBBY
D: Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
C: RAYETTE
D: I did, didn' I, El?
C: BOBBY
D: You got another ball comin'.
N: She moves to the rack and, concentrating hard, advances down the lane and releases the ball. It rolls slowly down the center, hits at precisely the right spot and clears the pins.
C: ELTON
D: Atta boy, Ray!
N: Ecstatic, she comes back to the banquette, seating herself beside Bobby and trying to solicit a response from him.
C: RAYETTE
D: That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, great. Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
E: begins removing his bowling shoes
N: Turning to address the two young women over the back of the banquette.
C: BOBBY
D: Wasn't it, ladies?
E: CONT'D
C: TWINKY
D: Are you talking to us?
E: pointing at herself
N: Rayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them to the floor.
C: RAYETTE
D: I'm gonna go wait in the car.
N: He stretches his arms out on the back of the banquette as though he intends to reside there awhile.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, why don't you do that.
N: She grabs her sling-back and her purse and as she gets up:
C: STONEY
D: Wait an I'll I go with you, honey...
N: As she picks up her belongings and follows Rayette:
C: ELTON
D: We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
E: changing his shoes
C: BOBBY
D: Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers... An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
E: hands him the bowling shoes
N: Elton moves off and Bobby, now full of remorse, slumps into a depressed reverie. Beyond him, Betty and Twinky, can be seen, engaged in some discussion concerning him. A WAITRESS with a tray approaches and leans down to him.
C: WAITRESS
D: Can I get you anything else?
C: BOBBY
D: No. How much do I owe you?
C: WAITRESS
D: Five'll do it.
N: He takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays them on her tray. She thanks him and moves off. As he reaches down and pulls on one of his boots, Twinky approaches behind him and leans down over the back of the banquette.
C: TWINKY
D: We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
C: BOBBY
D: Am I on TV?
C: TWINKY
D: She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
E: pointing lo Betty
C: BOBBY
D: Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
N: Betty appears on the other side of the banquette.
C: BETTY
D: See, I told you it was him... Your name's Donnie something, right?
E: then to Bobby
C: BOBBY
D: I leave it to you.
C: BETTY
D: My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
C: BOBBY
D: Twinky?
E: looking to Twinky
C: BETTY
D: Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
E: explaining
C: BOBBY
D: Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
E: looking from one to the other
C: BETTY
D: That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
C: BOBBY
D: A wig?
E: touching his hair
C: BETTY
D: Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
C: BOBBY
D: Your little friend's real sharp there... Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
E: to Twinky to Betty
C: TWINKY
D: Oh, definitely...
C: BETTY
D: Yeah, but I can see a little bitty of the net up there, that's what give it away.
E: looking at his hairline
C: TWINKY
D: It's so weird to see you in person, but that's who she says you are.
C: BETTY
D: It is him, he said it's him. Aren't you.
E: to her to Bobby
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, you could say it's me.
N: Twinky reaches over to the scoring table, picking up a pencil and a score sheet.
C: TWINKY
D: I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case... We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
E: as she writes
C: BOBBY
D: Well, you seem very professional...
C: TWINKY
D: I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
E: handing the score sheet to him
N: He glances at the dwarfish Betty.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, I can see how she'd come in handy.
S: EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Rayette sits sulking in Bobby's car. He comes up to the passenger window and leans down to her.
C: BOBBY
D: Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
C: RAYETTE
D: I'm not.
C: BOBBY
D: You just going to sit there?
C: RAYETTE
D: Yes.
C: BOBBY
D: Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
C: RAYETTE
D: I hope they do.
N: He casually slaps the outside of the door.
C: BOBBY
D: See you later, then...
N: He walks off through the lot. ON RAYETTE staring out through the windshield. ON BOBBY as he stops and comes back to the car.
C: BOBBY
D: No one would want to hit on you, you look too pathetic.
N: No response.
C: BOBBY
D: Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
E: CONT'D
C: RAYETTE
D: You're the pathetic one, not me.
C: BOBBY
D: I'm going on over there...
C: RAYETTE
D: I'm not some piece a crap.
C: BOBBY
D: I know you're not.
C: RAYETTE
D: You treat me like I was.
C: BOBBY
D: I'm sorry.
C: RAYETTE
D: You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
E: close to tears
C: BOBBY
D: Now, hand...
N: He opens the door and gets inside, putting his arm around her.
C: BOBBY
D: Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
E: CONT'D
C: RAYETTE
D: You're goin' a find me dead one time.
C: BOBBY
D: Sssh, come on now... Be a good girl.
E: he kisses her
C: RAYETTE
D: If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
C: BOBBY
D: I'm not going to get up an' leave you. Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
E: kisses her again, then:
C: RAYETTE
D: Do you love me, Bobby?
N: He hesitates briefly, then:
C: BOBBY
D: Well now, what do you think?
N: Though hardly an undying declaration, it's close enough to fill her with forgiveness. Reaching over, she pulls him into her arms.
S: EXT. SIGNAL HILL DERRICK - DAY
N: KALEIDOSCOPIC SERIES OF SCENES, showing Elton and Bobby WORKING THE RIG as part of a four-man team. The DRILLER stands back, giving them directives, while the prestigious DERRICKMAN, the "star" of the team, lounges around in the b.g. Though he has been working the fields for some months, it is apparent that Bobby is still somewhat of a novice in the operations of the rig.
T: FADE OVER ABOVE ACTIONS, to:
S: INT. SIGNAL HILL DOGHOUSE - DAY
N: An impromptu card game, taking place on a lunch break. (IMPROVISED) Bobby, in a buoyant mood, lays down a winning poker hand and rakes in a pile of bills and change lying on the table.

S: INT. TWINKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Bobby sits morosely on the couch beside Twinky. One of his arms is around her, the other holds a can of beer. Both he and Twinky are looking at... ... Elton, who rides Betty on his leg as both sing "Ride a Cockhorse To Banbury Cross." She begins to laugh with the hysterical abandon of a child, and Elton, nearly beside himself, looks over to Bobby.
C: ELTON
D: God, id'n she the cutest damn thing in your life!
S: EXT. SIGNAL HILL FIELD - DAY
N: (ELTON SINGING A RANK DOGHOUSE SONG OVER:) REMOTE ANGLE ON BOBBY AND ELTON Having been up all night, drinking, they move unsteadily toward a derrick and are intercepted by the driller as they climb the stairs to the rig floor.

N: ON ELTON
C: ELTON
D: Where the hell's he goin'?
S: EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
N: Bobby cuts in front of another car and climbs up into the rear of the truck. Moving to the front of it, he looks out over the cab. POV of the glut of cars in all four lanes.
C: ELTON
D: Hey, Bob! Come on! Quit foolin' around!
S: EXT. TRUCK - FREEWAY - DAY
N: On his way out of the truck, Bobby pauses to look beneath one of the padded protectors, then pulls it off to reveal an upright piano. He leans down to the keyboard and plays a few notes.

S: EXT. TRUCK - LONG BEACH STREETS - DAY
N: (CHOPIN PRELUDE OVER:) The truck slows and comes to a stop at a signal. Bobby jumps out and moves to the sidewalk. FOLLOWING with him as he wanders, boozed and aimless, along the dispirited cheap streets of the city.
S: INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT
N: Rayette clears some plates from an empty table and, crossing the diner, sees... ... Bobby entering. As he takes a seat at the counter, she goes about her tasks, ignoring him. He watches her as she moves to the only other customer and totals his bill. Another waitress appears with a coffee Silex. She gestures it at Bobby and he nods. As she pours him a cup, Rayette moves to the register, deposits some bills, then turns and exits to the kitchen.
S: EXT. REAR OF DINER - LATE NIGHT
N: Bobby leans against a pickup adjacent to Rayette's car. She comes out of the rear door of the diner, hesitates as she sees him, then moves past him to her car.
C: BOBBY
D: I was with Elton last night, Ray.
N: Maintaining her attitude of suffered injustice, she reaches to the car door and opens it.
C: BOBBY
D: It's the truth.
E: CONT'D
N: He reaches behind her and pushes the door shut. Then gently taking hold of her arm, he turns her toward him, bringing his face close to hers...
C: BOBBY

N: ... and as she turns away, be begins to kiss her neck. She lowers her gaze to the ground, quietly uttering:
C: RAYETTE
D: You son of a bitch.
S: INT. ELTON AND STONEY'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
N: Bobby, Elton and Stoney are seated on the couch, all looking toward the TV, playing an old black-and white. Rayette is seated on an adjacent chair, holding an infant in her lap, cooing and fawning over it throughout the following.
C: ELTON
D: I swore to God I'd never hire on to this type a work again. Christ, I don't know how the hell I let you talk me into it...
N: Rayette reaches over to Bobby.
C: RAYETTE
D: Give me a swig, hon'.
N: He hands her his beer and as she takes a sip and hands it back:
C: ELTON
D: You didn' know I was a derrickman once, did you?
N: Bobby shakes his head.
C: ELTON
D: Down in the southern fields, an' man, did I hate it. An' Stoney's brother was a well-puller, wad'n he, honey? The one with three fingers?

N: Elton reaches down and wipes the mayonnaise off his pant leg.
C: ELTON
D: If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
C: BOBBY
D: I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
N: He grabs his jacket and his lunch bucket, jumps down off the rig and begins walking toward his car parked by the Field Office. In the b.g., Elton gets up and hurls his hard hat toward Bobby.
C: ELTON
D: Shit ass!!
N: As he approaches his car, he looks toward the Field Office, where... ... The driller is leaning down to a car with TWO MEN in it. ON BOBBY calling over to him:
C: BOBBY
D: Hey, Longcipher! I'm quitting!
N: The driller gestures a direction to the driver of the car, and as it pulls off, he moves toward the office:
C: BOBBY
D: Longcipher! I'm talking to you!
E: CONT'D
N: The driller opens the office door and looks back to Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: Did you hear me?! I said I'm quitting!
E: CONT'D
C: DRILLER
D: I don't give a shit what you do. You ben more trouble than you're worth, an' I'm damn glad to be rid of both a you assholes.
N: He goes into the office and closes the door. ON BOBBY throwing his jacket and his lunch bucket into his car. As he starts to get in, his attention is drawn back to the rig. POV: The car that held the two men is parked next to it, and both men are on the rig platform moving toward Elton. He backs away from them, breaks toward the rig tour and starts to climb it. One of the men catches hold of his leg and yanks him back. Elton pulls loose from him, jumps to the ground and begins running with both men in pursuit.
C: BOBBY
D: Hey! What's goin' on?!
N: He starts sprinting back to the rig. The first man has a hold on Elton and is struggling to subdue him. He is joined by the second man, and as they force his arms behind his back and cuff his wrists... ... Bobby MOVES INTO FRAME, grabbing onto the first man and wrestling him away from Elton.
C: ELTON
D: Don't do that, Bob!! It's the Law!
N: Bobby hurls the man onto the ground and turns around to go after the second man, struggling with Elton.
C: ELTON
D: It's the Law, Bob, don't mix in!
E: CONT'D
N: The second man pushes Elton aside and as Bobby throws a punch at him...
C: ELTON
D: Look out behind!
E: CONT'D
N: ... the other grabs him from behind, holding him, while the second man jams a fist into his stomach and, as he doubles over, follows with a violent chop to the back of his neck. Bobby slumps to the ground, and as the first man puts a knee into his back and prepares to handcuff him:
C: ELTON
D: Hey, don't do that. Don't you think you could just leave him...
E: CONT'D
N: The second man takes hold of Elton and starts to move him off.
C: ELTON
D: Sure as hell he wouldn' a done that if he'd known who you was... Would you, Bob?
N: Bobby, dazed, raises his head from the dirt, looking toward Elton.
C: BOBBY
D: Christ Almighty, what's happening here?
C: SECOND MAN
D: Okay, let him go.
N: As he starts pushing a resistant Elton toward the car, Bobby sits up.
C: BOBBY
D: Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
C: ELTON
D: I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
C: SECOND MAN
D: Come on.
C: ELTON
D: I got wild an' jumped my bail...
C: SECOND MAN
D: Move it!
N: He takes him roughly by the arm and moves off with the first man following.
C: ELTON
D: An' here they come runnin' after me a year later... Ain't that somethin'?
E: over his shoulder, to Bobby
N: ON BOBBY looking toward: The two men forcing Elton into the rear seat of the car, as he calls back to Bobby:
C: ELTON
D: Tell Stoney for me, will you?! Tell her to come get me...
N: They close the door on him and get into the car. As it drives off... Bobby sits watching until it disappears from sight, then he sits back against a pump casing and drops his head onto his chest.
S: INT. TWINKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON TWINKY'S FACE She opens her mouth and rends the air with a keening wail. Her face beads with moisture and journeys through expressions indistinguishable from grief and anguish. Presently, an ecstatic and very professional screech issues from her, after which she reaches up and pulls Bobby down onto her, breathing into his ear...
C: TWINKY
D: Donnie, oh Donnie...
S: INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
N: (BACH PARTITA FAINTLY UNDER:) Bobby, dressed in a suit and tie, moves through a network of hallways, checking the door numbers. He arrives at a door designated as Studio A, and, after hesitating for a moment, opens it and steps inside.
S: INT. STUDIO A RECORDING BOOTH - DAY
N: (BACH PARTITA UNDER:) TWO RECORDING ENGINEERS glance at him without interest and return to their dials and needles. Bobby looks from them through the glass partition to the recording studio in view beyond. POV: ELIZABETH "TITA" DUPEA is at the piano, intensely into the Bach. She wears a monastic-looking dress, her unruly hair is pinned back from her face, and her glasses lie on the bench beside her. ON BOBBY watching her with both affection and appreciation. ON TITA She is "sounding" as she plays, in tones out-of-key and discordant with the Bach.
C: FIRST ENGINEER
D: There she goes again.
N: Bobby glances over at him, then looks back to Tita. POV: She hunches over the keyboard and plays an arpeggio, humming a long monochromatic note.
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: My 1-year-old can carry a tune better than that.
N: Bobby is about to defend her, when the engineer flips a toggle switch and addresses the mike feeding into the studio:
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: Miss Dupea.
E: CONT'D
N: There is no response and she continues playing.
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: Miss Dupea.
E: CONT'D more emphatic
C: TITA
D: Yes.
E: annoyed
N: Bobby can be seen in the b.g., having difficulty restraining his irritation under the following:
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
C: TITA
D: Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: If you want to call it that.
C: TITA
D: Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: That's exactly what I am doing, again.
C: TITA
D: Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
C: TITA
D: Oh, for pity's sake...
N: She puts her elbows on top of the piano and drops her head into her bands.
C: FIRST ENGINEER
D: Is she going to cry again?
C: TITA
D: I don't want to take a break.
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: What would you like in your coffee?
N: She makes a mumbled response, her head still in her bands:
C: TITA
D: Tea.
C: BOBBY
D: Would you tell her Bobby's here?
C: SECOND ENGINEER
D: Miss Dupea, Bobby's here.
E: to the mike
N: She raises her head, squints toward the booth, then grabs her glasses from the bench and puts them on.
S: INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
N: Bobby enters the studio and comes toward her, opening his arms. She rushes into his embrace, burying her face in his shoulder.
C: TITA
D: Oh my goodness... Bobby...
E: very emotional
C: BOBBY
D: Hi, Tita.
N: She raises her head to look at him, and verging on tears:
C: TITA
D: Robert Eroica...
C: BOBBY
D: Now don't...
C: TITA
D: No, I'm not... I'm not.
E: taking a deep breath, then:
C: BOBBY
D: That's good.
N: A NEW ANGLE Tita sits on the piano bench, crying and searching through her purse for a tissue. Bobby hovers behind her, gently patting her on the back and glancing with some embarrassment toward the recording booth.
C: TITA
D: I just can't look at you.
C: BOBBY
D: Don't, then.
N: As she blows her nose into the tissue, a young man comes into view, hands Bobby a paper cup and leaves. Tita takes another tissue from her purse and dabs at her eyes.
C: TITA
D: You always do this to me.
C: BOBBY
D: Well, I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.
E: setting the cup down on the piano
C: TITA
D: Thank you... Oh no, don't put it on there...
E: then:
N: She quickly picks up the cup and places it on the floor.
C: BOBBY
D: Sorry.
C: TITA
D: This is a very special, very old CB 275...
E: caressing the piano
C: BOBBY
D: Oh.
C: TITA
D: You know who it once belonged to?
C: BOBBY
D: No.
C: TITA
D: Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
C: BOBBY
D: No kidding.
E: politely
N: He sits down on the bench beside her...
C: TITA
D: It has absolutely no objectionable idiosyncrasies...
N: ... and tests it out with a brief flourish on the keys. She watches him, then:
C: TITA
D: Robert...
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Very nice.
E: stops playing
C: TITA
D: I have to talk seriously with you...
C: BOBBY
D: Everybody still up on the Island?
C: TITA
D: Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
C: BOBBY
D: Who's Van Oost?
C: TITA
D: Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
E: not fond of the subject
C: BOBBY
D: Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
C: TITA
D: Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
N: Bobby laughs.
C: BOBBY
D: Sprained his neck?
N: Tita laughs, then:
C: TITA
D: It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
C: BOBBY
D: Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck. That's Carl...
E: shaking his head
C: TITA
D: Robert, I have to tell you something...
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: TITA
D: Daddy's very ill.
C: BOBBY
D: Oh, well, what, what's he...
C: TITA
D: He's had two strokes.
N: He looks away from her, not wanting to hear any more.
C: TITA
D: He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Don't tell me about this...
E: standing up
N: He moves away from the piano and Tita turns to look at him.
C: TITA
D: But don't you think it's right, though, that you should see him, at least once...
C: SECOND ENGINEER'S VOICE
D: We're ready Miss Dupea.
E: miked
C: TITA
D: Just a minute, please! Robert, don't you think it's right that you should see him?
E: to the booth to Bobby
N: He moves aimlessly about trying to subdue his anguish.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah... I guess so...
C: TITA
D: I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
C: BOBBY
D: No...
N: He glances at her, catching her profound disappointment.
C: BOBBY
D: I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
E: CONT'D
C: TITA
D: I know.
N: He looks toward the booth.
C: BOBBY
D: Well... I better let you...
E: then, to Tita
C: TITA
D: Wait...
N: She gets up from the bench and goes to him, taking hold of his arm.
C: TITA
D: I'll walk out with you...
E: CONT'D
N: As they move to the hall door, she addresses the booth:
C: TITA
D: I'll be back in two minutes!
E: CONT'D
C: SECOND ENGINEER'S VOICE
D: Cut that in half, will you?
N: She smiles at Bobby as they go out into hall.
C: TITA
D: They hate me, I feel.
N: FOLLOWING WITH THEM down the hallway.
C: BOBBY
D: Maybe you better stay, then.
C: TITA
D: No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
C: BOBBY
D: Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
N: They stop at the stairway.
C: TITA
D: Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, me, too...
C: TITA
D: It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
C: BOBBY
D: Tita, I've got to go...
E: cutting her off
C: TITA
D: All right...
N: He kisses her.
C: TITA
D: Okay.
E: CONT'D
N: Feeling herself about to break down again, she attempts a valiant smile and stands watching as... ... Bobby turns and goes down the stairs.

C: BOBBY
D: Hope you didn't strain yourself, getting in here and into your pose before I hit the door.
E: CONT'D
N: He picks up a suitcase from the closet floor, grabs some of his clothes from the rack, and, moving to a chair, sets the suitcase on it and begins packing.
C: BOBBY
D: I have to go home. My father's sick.
E: CONT'D
N: Rayette turns on her side, making a snorting sound of disbelief.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, it's very funny.
E: CONT'D
N: He moves to a dresser, extracts his underwear and returns to the suitcase.
C: BOBBY
D: I'll be gone two or three weeks.
E: CONT'D
C: RAYETTE
D: You'll be gone, period.
E: not looking at him
N: He closes the suitecase, secures it...
C: BOBBY
D: I'll try and call you from up there.
N: ... and picking it up, moves around the bed toward the door. He stops, setting the suitcase on the bed and looking down at her. She is still faced away from him, her shoulders trembling as she weeps soundlessly.
C: BOBBY
D: Come on, DiPesto. I never told you it would work out to anything. Did I?
E: CONT'D very emotional
N: He looks away from her, to the window.
C: BOBBY
D: I'll send you some money, that's all I can do.
E: CONT'D
N: Returning his gaze to her:
C: BOBBY
D: And... I'll call you, like I said... Bye, Ray.
E: CONT'D he pauses, then
N: An audible sob finally comes from her. Bobby quickly picks up the suitcase and moves out of the bedroom and down the hall.

D: Is it an accident?
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Bobby pulls off onto the right-hand shoulder, stops the car and gets out. He moves out to the center line, looking across the road, to: A long-haired young woman (PALM) in Levi's and parka, presently pushing her close-cropped, boyish looking friend (TERRY) against the side of the car and making some indecipherable accusation.
C: BOBBY
D: Hey! What's going on, what's the trouble?!
N: The young woman turns and gives him the finger.
C: PALM
D: Rotate, mack!
N: ON RAYETTE sticking her head out the driver's window.
C: RAYETTE
D: What'd she say?
N: ON PALM gesturing angrily back at the wreck as she crosses toward Bobby.
C: PALM
D: Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
C: BOBBY
D: You're lucky no one was hurt.
C: PALM
D: Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
N: Without waiting for a response, she moves back to Terry, who is retrieving some of their belongings from the highway.
C: PALM
D: Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
E: CONT'D
C: RAYETTE
D: Jesus, what a rude person...
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - DAY
N: Palm and Terry, still under the spell of their roadside tiff, sit in sulky silence in the back seat. Bobby glances at Palm in the rear view.
C: BOBBY
D: What's your name?
C: PALM
D: Palm Apodaca.
N: Rayette turns around and, thinking Terry is a boy, asks rather flirtatiously:
C: RAYETTE
D: An' what's your name?
C: TERRY
D: Terry Grouse.
N: Shocked at the female voice coming from "him," she turns back around and pokes Bobby on the leg.
C: BOBBY

C: RAYETTE
D: I'll tell you... ... l-a-t-e-r.

C: BOBBY
D: Where are you going?
C: PALM
D: Alaska.
C: BOBBY
D: Alaska? Are you on vacation?
C: TERRY
D: She wants to live there, because she thinks it's cleaner.
E: sullenly
C: BOBBY
D: Cleaner than what?
C: PALM
D: You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
E: to Terry
C: BOBBY
D: How do you know it's clean?
C: PALM
D: I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
N: She leans forward, looking annoyed.

S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NORTHERN HIGHWAY - DAY
N: (COUNTRY & WESTERN INSTRUMENTAL OVER:) ON THE CAR moving through the Redwood country above San Francisco.
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
N: ON BOBBY bored, as he drives. Beside him, Rayette primps in the sunvisor mirror. ON THE BACK SEAT Terry lights a cigarette while Palm, staring morosely out the window, goes into a soliloquy:
C: PALM
D: I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
C: BOBBY
D: Who?
C: PALM
D: Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
N: Rayette leans around to her.
C: RAYETTE
D: There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
C: PALM
D: A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
C: TERRY
D: Mass production is what does it.
C: PALM
D: What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
C: TERRY
D: Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
C: PALM
D: Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
C: TERRY
D: In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
C: PALM
D: In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
C: TERRY
D: Yeah, it could be adorable...
C: PALM
D: And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
N: She gestures angrily out the window at the roadside billboards.
C: PALM
D: ... they oughta be erased! All those signs, selling crap, and more crap, and, I don't know, it's disgusting, I don't even want to talk about it!
E: CONT'D
N: Bobby starts to say something:
C: BOBBY
D: Well...
C: PALM
D: It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
C: RAYETTE
D: Well...
C: PALM
D: Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
N: She suddenly leans over to the front seat, pointing to a semi ahead.
C: PALM
D: Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
E: CONT'D
C: RAYETTE
D: That's an old maid's tale.
C: PALM
D: Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
N: Rayette turns around, asserting:
C: RAYETTE
D: Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
C: PALM
D: Don't call me "honey," mack.
C: RAYETTE
D: Don't call me "mack," honey.
C: PALM
D: I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
C: RAYETTE
D: You better hold onto your tongue!
C: PALM
D: Hold onto this.
E: giving her the finger
N: Terry laughs.
C: RAYETTE
D: Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
C: BOBBY
D: Shut up! All of you!
S: INT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DAY
N: All four are seated at a booth. The women have given their orders and a WAITRESS stands above Bobby, waiting for his:
C: BOBBY
D: I'll have an omelette, no potatoes. Give me tomatoes instead, and wheat toast instead of rolls.
E: looking at his menu
N: The waitress indicates something on the menu with the butt of her pencil.
C: WAITRESS
D: No substitutions.
C: BOBBY
D: What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
C: WAITRESS
D: No. We have tomatoes.
E: annoyed
C: BOBBY
D: But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
C: WAITRESS
D: Only what's on the menu... A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
E: again, indicating with her pencil
C: BOBBY
D: I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
C: WAITRESS
D: I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
N: She starts to move away and Bobby detains her.
C: BOBBY
D: Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
C: WAITRESS
D: I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
C: BOBBY
D: What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
C: WAITRESS
D: Would you like to talk to the manager?
C: PALM
D: Hey, mack!
C: BOBBY
D: Shut up. You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
E: to Palm to the waitress
C: WAITRESS
D: I don't make the rules.
C: BOBBY
D: Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
N: She begins writing down his order, repeating it sarcastically:
C: WAITRESS
D: One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
C: BOBBY
D: Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
C: WAITRESS
D: You want me to hold the chicken.
E: challenging him
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
N: The other three laugh, and the waitress points to a "Right to Refuse" sign above the counter.
C: WAITRESS
D: You see that sign, sir?!
N: Bobby glances over at it, then back to her.
C: WAITRESS
D: You'll all have to leave, I'm not taking any more of your smartness and your sarcasm!
E: CONT'D
N: He smiles politely at her, then:
C: BOBBY
D: You see this sign?
N: He reaches his arm out and "clears" the table for her.
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - DAY
N: ON PALM in the back seat.
C: PALM
D: Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
C: BOBBY
D: I didn't get it, did I?
C: PALM
D: No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
N: (COUNTRY & WESTERN OVER:) ON THE CAR moving through the Northwest coastal region.
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Palm resumes her monologue:
C: PALM
D: People... Oofh... Animals are not like that... They're always cleaning themselves. Did you ever see... What are they called? Pigeons!
E: shaking her head in utter disgust
N: She looks over at Terry, slumped in her seat, asleep.
C: PALM
D: He's always picking on himself and his friends. They're always picking bugs out of their hair...
E: CONT'D
N: ON RAYETTE asleep.
C: PALM
D: Monkeys, too.
E: O.S.
N: ON PALM
C: PALM
D: Except monkeys do things out in the open that I don't go for.
N: ON BOBBY benumbed, his eyes glazed over as he stares out through the windshield. ON PALM
C: PALM
D: I was in this place once, this store, with snakes, monkeys, everything you could imagine. I walked in, I had to run out. It stunk! They didn't even have an incense going...
N: Though no one listens, she goes on, working herself up:
C: PALM
D: And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
C: TERRY
D: Steam.
E: half-dead
C: PALM
D: Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - LATE DAY
N: (WYNETTE'S "WHEN THERE'S A FIRE" OVER:) ON PALM AND TERRY deposited at the side of the highway, with their luggage, duffle bags and television set lying on the road edge. Terry lifts a bored hand to wave at... ... Bobby, behind the wheel. He waves back, pulls out onto the highway and drives off.
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - MOTEL - NIGHT
T: (MUSIC FADES, AS:)
N: The car pulls into a motel parking slot and stops.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bobby and Rayette in bed. She lies on her side, watching him watch TV. After a moment:
C: RAYETTE
D: Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
C: BOBBY
D: No.
C: RAYETTE
D: I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
C: BOBBY
D: Is what you?
C: RAYETTE
D: You're depressed that I come along.
C: BOBBY
D: Who said I was depressed?
C: RAYETTE
D: Well, is that a happy face I see?
N: No response.
C: RAYETTE
D: 'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
N: He turns off the light on the night stand and rolls onto his side, faced away from her. They lie silently in the dark for a moment. Then:
C: RAYETTE
D: I don't know if I'm gonna be able to sleep or not.
N: No response.
C: RAYETTE
D: Hint, hint.
E: CONT'D looking over at him
N: No response.
C: RAYETTE
D: I guess I'll just have to count the sheep. One-two-three-four...
E: CONT'D sighing; then: closing her eyes
N: She opens her eyes and looks over at him.
C: RAYETTE
D: Seven... eight... Look at this old cold shoulder, what am I gonna do with it?
E: CONT'D caressing his shoulder
N: He looks around at her and with gentle good humor:
C: BOBBY
D: If you just wouldn't open your mouth, everything would be fine.
N: She turns an imaginary key at her lips.
C: RAYETTE
D: Tick a lock.
N: He rolls over to face her and, yielding to her request, begins to make love to ber.
S: EXT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Rayette following after Bobby. As he moves to his car, he removes some cash from his wallet.
C: RAYETTE
D: Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
C: BOBBY
D: I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
N: He holds out a roll of bills and as she takes them:
C: RAYETTE
D: So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
C: BOBBY
D: If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
C: RAYETTE
D: Bobby, don't talk like that...
N: She moves over to him and gives him a quick kiss.
C: RAYETTE
D: It'll be all right, I'll get a hold a some magazines an' things like that. An' maybe find a beauty salon an' get my hair fixed, okay?
E: CONT'D
N: ON BOBBY getting into the car.
C: BOBBY
D: Okay, Ray...
C: RAYETTE
D: Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
C: BOBBY
D: Sure...
E: starting the engine
C: RAYETTE
D: It brings out my eyes...
C: BOBBY
D: Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
C: RAYETTE
D: Okay...
N: She watches unhappily as he backs out of the slot and the car pulls away.
C: RAYETTE
D: Bye, baby...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. FERRY (CROSSING) - DAY
N: Bobby gets out of his car and wanders the deck of the ferry. He stops to look out over the Sound to one of the islands off the Washington coast, then glances back to the mainland, receding in the distance.
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - FERRY LANDING - DAY
N: Bobby drives off the ferry onto the island.
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
N: The car moves over a tree-lined country lane and presently turns off onto a private road, leading to a large Victorian-style house. It pulls to a stop behind two other cars. Bobby gets out of the car and moves up the porch steps to the front door. CLOSER ON him as he hesitates, listening briefly to the FAINT SOUND of two pianos coming from within. Then he opens the door and goes inside.
S: INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
N: (TWO PIANOS OVER:) Bobby tentatively wanders the first floor of the house, taking in the ghosts of the past. In the living room, he pauses at a table to look at several framed photographs. He picks up one of his mother and father, looks closely at it, then gently returns it to its place and resumes wandering. He stops at the music room and looks in through the half-opened door: POV INTO MUSIC ROOM: On the far side of the room, near windows which give view to a verdant exterior, are two concert grands. His brother CARL is seated at one of the pianos, and a young woman (CATHERINE VAN OOST) is seated at the other. ON BOBBY looking from Carl, to Catherine. He watches her briefly, then steps out of the doorway... ... and moves down a hallway to a closed door. He reaches down and opens it, looking inside to: TITA grooming the hair of an elderly man (NICHOLAS DUPEA) seated in a wheelchair with his back to Bobby. She looks up and, seeing Bobby, smiles happily, then reaches down and turns the wheelchair around. ON NICHOLAS His eyes are half-closed and are cast down to the floor. Bobby moves over to him, bending down and looking into his face. Nicholas opens his eyes slightly and gazes through Bobby into an absolute elsewhere. Bobby raises his eyes to Tita.
C: BOBBY
D: He doesn't even know who the hell I am.
S: INT. DUPEA DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Nicholas Dupea sits at the head of the table, being fed his dinner by a male nurse (SPICER). Bobby, at the opposite end of the table, is seated next to Tita. Unable to bear looking at his father, he glances over at Catherine, seated next to Carl on his right. She raises her eyes from her plate to ask him something, just as Tita is moved to reminisce:
C: TITA
D: Remember, Bobby, what mother used to say when...
C: CATHERINE
D: How long have you been... Oh, excuse me...
E: to Bobby To Tita
C: TITA
D: No, it's all right, you go ahead...
C: CATHERINE
D: I was just going to ask Robert how long he's been away from here.
C: BOBBY
D: Four or five years.
C: CARL
D: No, the last time was three years ago.
C: TITA
D: Oh no, it's been much more than that.
C: CARL
D: Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
C: TITA
D: I don't think that's true.
C: CARL
D: It is true.
C: TITA
D: Besides being very rude.
C: CATHERINE
D: What have you been doing since then?
C: BOBBY
D: What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
C: CATHERINE
D: And you no longer play at all?
N: Bobby starts to reply and is interrupted by:
C: CARL
D: You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
C: TITA
D: Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
C: CARL
D: I don't know where you were, penis envy.
C: TITA
D: I hope I didn't hear that.
C: CARL
D: At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
C: BOBBY
D: Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
C: TITA
D: I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
N: She looks at Spicer, pushing a spoon at Nicholas's closed mouth.
C: TITA
D: Don't force him like that, Spicer.
E: CONT'D
N: Spicer lays the spoon down and begins eating his own dinner.
C: BOBBY
D: How long have you been staying here?
E: to Catherine
C: TITA
D: A couple of months.
N: He starts to ask another question and is again overridden by:
C: CARL
D: Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: CARL
D: It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around... ... like this...
E: demonstrating
N: Tita gets up from the table and, taking her plate, exits to the kitchen. And as Carl readjusts himself in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass, Bobby looks at Catherine to find her looking at him. She quickly alters her gaze to Carl.
C: CATHERINE
D: I wouldn't mind doing a little work, if you're finished, and not too tired...
C: CARL
D: No, I'm finished... Satiety is my father and mother.
E: placing a hand on his stomach
N: Finding he's amused himself and nobody else, he gets up and addresses Bobby.
C: CARL
D: She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Is she?
E: looking at her
N: Catherine stands up and, wanting to change the subject:
C: CATHERINE
D: Excuse me, I don't want to hear this...
N: She exits and Carl, on his way out, pauses at Bobby's chair.
C: CARL
D: I hope you feel at home, Robert. I'm really glad you're here.
E: patting him on the shoulder
C: BOBBY
D: Thanks, Carl...
N: He looks down table to see Spicer stacking his plate onto Nicholas's and his eyes follow him as he, too, moves out of the dining room to the kitchen. CLOSE ON BOBBY in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his father. He looks down at his plate, poking at the remainder of his dinner, then braves a look down the table. ON NICHOLAS looking back at him, his eyes devoid of interest or cognition.
S: EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
N: Bobby and Tita walk away from the house down toward the ocean. Accompanying them is a Borzoi hound belonging to her.
C: TITA
D: He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
C: BOBBY
D: Uhm hmm. Some range.
C: TITA
D: It's not that bad.
C: BOBBY
D: Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
C: TITA
D: A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
N: He doesn't respond.
C: TITA
D: I mean, you think I'm that happy?
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.
E: a pause, then:
C: TITA
D: We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
N: She stops walking and moves to one of the garden chairs, facing out toward the bay.
C: TITA
D: And anyway, I want you to stay, so I can spend some time with you, and ask you some questions...
E: CONT'D
N: He leans his back against a tree.
C: BOBBY
D: What questions?
C: TITA
D: Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
C: BOBBY
D: Sometimes.
N: She stares at him for a moment, and taking note of it:
C: BOBBY
D: Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
E: CONT'D
C: TITA
D: No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
E: a pause
C: BOBBY
D: Sort of.
N: She laughs.
C: TITA
D: Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
C: BOBBY
D: No, I don't really think you're a freak.
C: TITA
D: I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
C: BOBBY
D: What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
C: TITA
D: Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
C: BOBBY
D: Uhm hmm.
C: TITA
D: Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
C: BOBBY
D: You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
C: TITA
D: Like what?
C: BOBBY
D: Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
C: TITA
D: Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
C: BOBBY
D: There's nothing to say, Tita...
N: He offers nothing further and looks out over the bay. Then, after a brief silence:
C: TITA
D: Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
C: BOBBY
D: I don't know.
S: INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
N: Bobby strolls casually about the house - in truth, looking for an opportunity to run into Catherine. He moves to the music room and looks inside. THROUGH THE DOORWAY Catherine can be seen, seated at the piano. Carl stands above her and they engage in some exchange about the score resting on the piano's music stand. ON BOBBY as he moves down the hallway and sees: Spicer descending the staircase, with the brittle Nicholas in his arms. He ducks into the nearest room to avoid them.
S: INT. DEN - DUPEA HOME - DAY
N: Tita, startled in the act of appraising herself in a mirror above the fireplace, turns around to Bobby:
C: TITA
D: Oh God, don't sneak up on me like that!
N: We see she wears a little make-up and has done something "different" with her hair.
C: BOBBY
D: Sorry.
N: He turns and exits the den.
S: EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
N: Bobby stands on the front porch, looking toward... ... Catherine coming up from the ocean. She wears a bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a towel, and as she approaches:
C: CATHERINE
D: Hello...
C: BOBBY
D: I guess you fell in the water.
C: CATHERINE
D: Yes, intentionally.
E: amused
C: BOBBY
D: That's dangerous, you know.
C: CATHERINE
D: Swimming?
C: BOBBY
D: Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
N: She laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner of the towel.
C: CATHERINE
D: I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
C: BOBBY
D: Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
C: CATHERINE
D: Why?
C: BOBBY
D: What would I do with it? Run amok?
N: She comes up the stairs.
C: BOBBY
D: Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
E: CONT'D
C: CATHERINE
D: Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
C: BOBBY
D: Nothing.
C: CATHERINE
D: Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
C: BOBBY
D: That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
C: CATHERINE
D: I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
N: She moves toward the front door, with Bobby following.
C: BOBBY
D: What're you doing right now...
S: INT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
N: Catherine comes inside and moves toward the stairway, with Bobby behind.
C: CATHERINE
D: Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
C: BOBBY
D: Then after that?
N: She goes up a few steps and turns back to him.
C: CATHERINE
D: After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
C: BOBBY
D: Tomorrow, then.
C: CATHERINE
D: Tomorrow's a full practice day... But the day after is kind of open.
E: continues up the stairs
N: At the top of the stairs, she stops and looks down at him.
C: CATHERINE
D: Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: The day after tomorrow.
E: as if it were a year
C: CATHERINE
D: If you're free.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, I'll probably be free.
N: She turns and disappears into the second-floor hallway.
S: INT. DUPEA KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Dinner has concluded and Tita moves around the table, distributing cups and saucers. Carl is remote and off his feed. Spicer attends Nicholas, and Catherine looks across the table to Bobby as he drinks from a bottle of beer. After a moment, a loud belch comes from Nicholas and Tita quickly requests:
C: TITA
D: Don't laugh...
N: She attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do Bobby and Catherine, then changes the subject:
C: TITA
D: What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
E: CONT'D
C: CARL
D: I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
N: Catherine begins pouring the coffee.
C: CATHERINE
D: One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
C: BOBBY
D: I gave it a second thought.
N: Tita seats herself at the table, addressing Spicer:
C: TITA
D: He looks tired to me, Spicer. I think you should put him to bed.
N: He nods, and as he gets up and wheels Nicholas from the room:
C: CATHERINE
D: I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
C: BOBBY
D: I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
C: CATHERINE
D: You don't call that music, though.
C: BOBBY
D: Of course I do. It's music. You know...
N: He places his hands on the table and simulates the playing of a rousing production-type show-stopper, simultaneously vocalizing as he does. Though Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces disapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:
C: CARL
D: Robert, do you mind?
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: CARL
D: Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
N: He takes hold of Catherine's hand and stands up.
C: CATHERINE
D: We really don't have to, Carl, if you're not feeling good...
C: CARL
D: Well, maybe if we put the Thermaphore on me for a while, first...
E: a bit martyred
C: CATHERINE
D: Oh, all right.
N: And as they move to the door, she glances apologetically back at Bobby. Deflated and embarrassed, he looks away from Tita's sympathetic gaze. After a brief silence, she reaches to a platter on the table.
C: TITA
D: Do you want some gingerbread?
C: BOBBY
D: What?
E: elsewhere
C: TITA
D: With applesauce?
C: BOBBY
D: No, thanks...
S: INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bobby stands in the living room. It is dark and the only light comes from some burning logs in the fireplace. He listens briefly to the sounds of a Beethoven sonata coming from the music room... ... then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and lies down, staring absently into the flames. After a moment, he closes his eyes. ANOTHER ANGLE on his sleeping face as the sonata begins to FADE.
S: INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - MORNING
N: ON BOBBY still asleep in the chaise. He is suddenly jolted awake by a loud thud and sits up, looking out the window to: POV OF SPICER lifting a barbell with heavy weights attached to it. He does a series of vigorous presses with it, before he again lets the bar drop heavily onto the porch.
S: INT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
N: (BACH VIOLIN OVER:) Bobby stands in the hallway, a phone to his ear, listening to Rayette and looking down the hall toward the open door to Catherine's room.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, well fine, you know what I suggest, Ray... Because I don't know how long. Things are not going that well here...
E: listening
N: He listens again, his eyes on Catberine, moving around in her room.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, well I'm not having any fun, either, so why don't you... No, you can't, it's just not convenient, and I have to get off... Ray, I really have to go, I have to get off now... Another couple of days, maybe. I'll call you and let you -- All right, if you're gone, you're gone. Now I have to get off, okay? Bye, Ray...
E: CONT'D pause listening impatiently longer pause pause pause
N: He hangs up and, as he starts down the hall to Catherine's room, the VIOLIN STOPS and Carl steps out into the hall ahead of him. He carries his fiddle and detains Bobby, with:
C: CARL
D: Only 10 minutes of playing and it's already killing my neck...
N: Bobby looks past him to Catherine as she glances out at them and then closes the door to her room.
S: EXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
N: Bobby and Carl, playing a game of table tennis. Tita stands leaning against a tree, watching them. In the b.g., Spicer can be seen, meticulously oiling and cleaning the wheelchair. As they volley the ball back and forth:
C: BOBBY
D: You sure you should be playing, Carl?
C: CARL
D: What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
N: Carl hits into the net, and as the ball rebounds to him, he tosses it to Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: I don't know, there's something wrong with the way you move.
E: serving
N: Carl hits the net again.
C: CARL
D: I'm not aware of it. Like what?
C: BOBBY
D: Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
N: Carl serves and as they volley:
C: BOBBY
D: I'd hate to see you walk across a concert stage like that.
E: CONT'D
N: Carl tries a smash and mis-hits the ball...
C: BOBBY
D: Two -- Nineteen.
E: CONT'D
N: ... and as he retrieves it:
C: CARL
D: I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
E: irritated with Bobby
C: BOBBY
D: That's what I mean...
N: Carl comes back to the table.
C: CARL
D: Any particular humor, I meant.
N: He angrily serves the ball.
C: BOBBY
D: I think you should get someone to coach you how to walk. I think it's a substantial problem.
E: returning
N: He hits a smash and it sails past Carl into some shrubbery several yards away.
C: CARL
D: Dammit!
N: As he moves after the ball, Bobby gestures at him.
C: BOBBY
D: Look at that.
C: TITA
D: Why are you being so mean?
C: BOBBY
D: I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
N: She looks at Carl, bent over and searching through the shrubs.
C: TITA
D: I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, well, he's...
E: wanting to go on about it
N: She interrupts him, looking toward Spicer.
C: TITA
D: Bobby? Do you think Spicer is attractive?
N: He looks over at Spicer, polishing the frame of the wheelchair.
C: BOBBY
D: I think he's got a terrific personality.
C: TITA
D: You know, he was formerly a sailor.
N: Bobby gestures his paddle at Carl, on his way back with the ball.
C: BOBBY
D: Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
C: TITA
D: Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
N: Carl comes up to the table, asserting:
C: CARL
D: See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
C: BOBBY
D: At game, Carl.
N: Carl serves and they volley briefly. Then BobbY angles the ball sharply and puts it away.
C: BOBBY
D: That's three games to none, Carl.
E: CONT'D
C: CARL
D: All right, let's have a rematch.
C: BOBBY
D: I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
N: Carl takes a quick glance at his watch, then drops his paddle onto the table.
C: CARL
D: Too bad. Just when I was hitting my stride.
N: He starts away, then turns back.
C: CARL
D: Say goodbye to Catherine for me, will you?
E: CONT'D
N: As he moves off in the direction of the cars, Tita comes up beside Bobby.
C: TITA
D: Can I play now?
N: Carl calls over to them from his car:
C: CARL
D: Tell her I'll be back sometime tomorrow!
N: Bobby turns to Tita.
C: BOBBY
D: Where is she, anyway?
C: TITA
D: My turn.
E: ignoring the question
N: He hands her the paddle...
C: BOBBY
D: Why don't you and Spicer play?
N: ... and moves off toward the house.
S: INT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
N: Bobby knocks on Catherine's door and, hearing no response, opens it and steps inside.
S: INT. CATHERINE'S ROOM - DAY
N: He wanders about, discreetly touching nothing, but taking in some essence of Catherine from her belongings and from the scent of her that lingers in the room. His journey brings him into proximity with the windows and he pauses to look out at: TITA AND SPICER BELOW playing table tennis. He starts to move from the windows, when he sees: CATHERINE'S CAR pulling into view and parking near the garage. She gets out, and, carrying a shopping bag and a wrapped bouquet of flowers, pauses on her way to the house to have some exchange with Tita.
S: INT. DUPEA HOME - STAIRCASE - DAY
N: ON BOBBY quickly descending the staircase, and FOLLOWING with him as he moves to the music room and goes inside, leaving the door open.
S: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
N: He crosses to one of the grands, seats himself and rubs his hands together to warm them. Then, scanning his mental repertoire, he places his hands on the keyboard and begins to play a Chopin etude. Presently, Catherine appears in the doorway. She stands listening for a moment, then places the shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and sits down. Bobby glances at her, then returns his eyes to the keyboard. ON CATHERINE her features intensely concentrated, as she listens to his playing. ON BOBBY apparently deep into the music. On the wall behind him are the series of photographs seen in the opening and the present ANGLE FAVORS an 8-year-old Bobby in his dress suit, playing a recital. THE CAMERA MOVES down to his hands... ... then to Catherine, profoundly moved. ANGLE INCLUDING BOTH as Bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude. He lets his hands linger on the keys until the last overtones fade, then he removes them to his lap. After a brief silence:
C: CATHERINE
D: That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
C: BOBBY
D: Thank you.
C: CATHERINE
D: I was really very moved by the way you...
N: Unable to keep up the "serious" musician pose, a brief, derisive laugh issues from him.
C: CATHERINE
D: Is that funny?
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
C: CATHERINE
D: Why?
C: BOBBY
D: Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
C: CATHERINE
D: It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
C: BOBBY
D: I didn't have any.
C: CATHERINE
D: You had no inner feeling?
C: BOBBY
D: None.
C: CATHERINE
D: Then I must have been supplying it.
N: She gets up and crosses toward the settee.
C: BOBBY
D: Wait...
C: CATHERINE
D: Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: CATHERINE
D: At being a fake.
N: And as she picks up the flowers and the shopping bag:
C: BOBBY
D: Catherine...
C: CATHERINE
D: No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
N: She goes out the door. Bobby looks down at the keyboard. He closes the cover and softly utters:
C: BOBBY
D: Shit.
S: INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: She stands in front of a dresser mirror, pinning up her hair, preparatory to taking a bath. Her attention is drawn to... ... Bobby entering, and as he crosses to her, she quickly turns back to the mirror.
C: BOBBY
D: You think I'm a fake.
C: CATHERINE
D: I think it's what you think.
C: BOBBY
D: No, it isn't what I think.
C: CATHERINE
D: Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
N: She moves away from him and he follows her.
C: BOBBY
D: Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
C: CATHERINE
D: I don't think that's accurate...
E: stops and turns to him
C: BOBBY
D: Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
C: CATHERINE
D: I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
N: She moves back to the dresser and as she begins searching through an array of bath oils on top of it, Bobby steps in beside her.
C: BOBBY
D: It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
C: CATHERINE
D: I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
C: BOBBY
D: Some bath oil?
N: He lifts up one of the bottles.
C: BOBBY
D: What about this one? Or this one? How about some jasmine? What about some musk?
E: CONT'D picking up another and another and another
C: CATHFRINE
D: What are you doing!
C: BOBBY
D: What are you doing, screwing around with this crap?!
E: knocking the bottles over
N: A little intimidated by his aggressivity:
C: CATHERINE
D: I don't find your language that charming.
C: BOBBY
D: It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
C: CATHERINE
D: I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
N: He makes no move to go.
C: CATHERINE
D: You're not a serious person, by your own admission. And that may be interesting, but it doesn't interest me...
E: CONT'D
N: Needing the safety of distance, she moves over to the windows next to the bed. Again, he follows after her.
C: BOBBY
D: Serious, that's what's important to you?
C: CATHERINE
D: Yes, that's what's important to me...
N: He takes her by the shoulders...
C: BOBBY
D: Okay, let's be serious...
N: ... and forces her onto the bed.
C: CATHERINE
D: No, don't do that...
C: BOBBY
D: Shut up...
N: He hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants to say and cannot. Catherine looks up at him, uttering a quiet challenge:
C: CATHERINE
D: No inner feeling.
C: BOBBY
D: That's right.
C: CATHERINE
D: I don't believe vou.
N: He leans down to her, begins kissing her. Her arms encircle him and laying back on the bed, she pulls his body onto hers, fervently returning his kisses. And as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings, a FADE OVER BEGINS, to:
S: INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Catherine and Bobby lie side by side. He watches her as she addresses the ceiling:
C: CATHERINE
D: I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
C: BOBBY
D: That's what you said?
C: CATHERINE
D: Something witty and devastating like that.
N: She moves onto her side, looking over at him.
C: CATHERINE
D: As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... How are you?
E: CONT'D a pause, then:
C: BOBBY
D: I'm fine.
C: CATHERINE
D: Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
C: BOBBY
D: Is he?
C: CATHERINE
D: Yes.
N: She reaches over, tentatively caressing his face, then:
C: CATHERINE
D: Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, I think I could.
N: He kisses her, gets up and crosses to the door, and as he opens it:
C: CATHERINE
D: Robert?
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: CATHERINE
D: I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
C: BOBBY
D: Of course I'd like to.
S: EXT. LA ROCHE WOODS - DAY
N: (CHOPIN OVER:) Bobby and Catherine walk over a path through a thickly wooded area that presently brings them in sight of the Dupea house. He stops and, taking hold of her, leans back against a tree, kissing her. When they break off and resume walking, she takes one of his hands in both of hers and, after looking at the scars and callouses accumulated by his years of manual labor, she lays the hand against her cheek. The ANGLE ALTERS from them, to:
S: EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
N: A taxicab pulls up in front of the house. Rayette gets out with her suitcase and, after paying the driver, moves up the steps to the front door and reaches out to ring the bell.
S: INT. DUPEA DINING ROOM TABLE - NIGHT
N: ON RAYETTE looking down the table to Nicholas.
C: RAYETTE
D: You certainly do have a beautiful piece a real estate out here, Mr. Dupea.
N: ON NICHOLAS AND SPICER the former with his chin resting on his chest.
C: RAYETTE
D: Can he hear me?
E: turning to Bobby
N: Bobby doesn't respond.
C: TITA
D: He's not hard of hearing.
E: politely
C: RAYETTE
D: Well, that's a blessing, at least.
N: She takes a bite of food, and as she chews:
C: RAYETTE
D: This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
E: CONT'D to Bobby
C: BOBBY
D: I don't know.
N: ON CARL fascinated with Rayette, while beside him, Catherine keeps her eyes on her plate as she eats.
C: CARL
D: You've been staying in a motel all this time?
C: RAYETTE
D: For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
C: CARL
D: I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
C: RAYETTE
D: Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money... I didn't have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
E: to Bobby to Carl
C: CARL
D: Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
C: RAYETTE
D: Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
C: CARL
D: Not at all.
N: She goes on eating and there is a brief silence before she resumes, looking over at Catherine:
C: RAYETTE
D: That certainly is a beautiful head a hair you have.
C: CATHERINE
D: Thank you.
C: RAYETTE
D: Is it natural?
C: BOBBY
D: Rayette.
C: RAYETTE
D: What?
C: BOBBY
D: Just finish eating.
C: RAYETTE
D: Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
N: Carl laughs.
C: CARL
D: No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
C: RAYETTE
D: I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing... Is there any ketchup around?
E: to Tita
C: BOBBY
D: Oh, for chrissakes...
C: CARL
D: Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
C: RAYETTE
D: It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
C: BOBBY
D: I don't, huh?
N: He throws his napkin on the table, gets up and leaves the room. There is an awkward silence, followed by Rayette valiantly covering her own feelings:
C: RAYETTE
D: I guess Bobby's just about the moodiest man I ever ben with...
S: INT. FISHERMAN'S BAR - MAINLAND - NIGHT
N: (TAMMY WYNETTE'S "DON'T TOUCH ME" OVER:) Bobby finishes the last of several drinks. He ships a half pint into his jacket pocket, lays some bills on the bar and moves toward the door.
S: EXT. FISHERMAN'S BAR - MAINLAND - NIGHT
N: (WYNETTE OVER:) Thoroughly anesthetized, he wanders aimlessly through the harbor-front streets. As he disappears into the dark, the MUSIC FADES.
S: EXT. WHARF - MAINLAND - DAWN
N: ON BOBBY lying huddled on the boardwalk next to the boat slips. The crying of the gulls and the sound of outgoing fishing launches awaken him. Disoriented, he gets to his feet and, hugging himself against the cold, moves unsteadily down the dock.
S: EXT. FERRY - MORNING
N: Bobby's car pulls off the ferry and approaches a line of cars waiting to board. He sees Catherine at the wheel of the first car, and pulling abreast of her, stops and rolls down his window.
C: BOBBY
D: Where are you going?
C: CATHERINE
D: I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
C: BOBBY
D: I have to talk to you.
C: CATHERINE
D: I'll be back later...
N: The blocked cars behind each of them begin HONKING impatiently and CONTINUE TO under the following:
C: BOBBY
D: No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
C: CATHERINE
D: No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
C: BOBBY
D: Yes, it is!
E: overlapping her
N: A DRIVER behind Bobby sticks his bead out the window, yelling furiously at him:
C: DRIVER
D: Come on, get moving, dammit!!
C: BOBBY
D: Will you shut up for a minute!! Pull your car out of line.
E: turning around to him to Catherine
C: CATHERINE
D: No, I can't...
C: BOBBY
D: Will you let me talk to you, please?
C: CATHERINE
D: I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
C: BOBBY
D: Oh. You have to tell me that.
E: barely audible
C: CATHERINE
D: What?! I can't hear you!
N: He looks back at her not responding.
C: CATHERINE
D: I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Catherine...
C: CATHERINE
D: Please, I'll see you later this evening.
N: She pulls ahead and moves onto the ferry.
S: INT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: FAVORING SAMIA GLAVIA a friend of Carl's. (Somewhere under the following, the ANGLE ALTERS to include TWO OTHER FRIENDS, as well as Carl, Catherine, Bobby and Rayette, seated around the living room, variously captive to her monologue.)
C: SAMIA
D: But the point is, man is born into the world with a pre-existent adversary, both real and imaginary, so you'd have to say that aggression was one of his primary, psychic inheritances, which...
N: JOHN FINCHER, a professorial type, attempts to interject:
C: FINCHER
D: If I may beg to differ...
C: SAMIA
D: Beg all you like, John, but the fact remains that man takes enormous delight in aggressive acts, as well as the portrayal of aggressive acts, and to be triumphant over another no matter how, seems fundamental to his having a sense of well being, as well as...
C: FINCHER
D: No, I don't quarrel with your inference, but you draw too long a bow in your conclusions, which seem unnecessarily harsh and...
C: SAMIA
D: Well, I don't make poetry. As an analyst, I...
N: Rayette interrupts, calling across the room to Carl:
C: RAYETTE
D: Is there a TV in the house?
N: Carl starts to answer and is pre-empted by Samia:
C: SAMIA
D: John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
C: RAYETTE
D: There's some good things on it, though.
C: SAMIA
D: Pardon me?
C: RAYETTE
D: The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
C: SAMIA
D: I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
C: FINCHER
D: If you really hold such bleak views, how can you, in good conscience, carry on a practice?
C: SAMIA
D: Oh, there's always hope, I think, for a few individuals, if they're courageous enough to shed their illusions and their...
C: CATHERINE
D: And what about love?
E: cutting her off
C: SAMIA
D: What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
C: CATHERINE
D: No, I wouldn't.
C: SAMIA
D: Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
N: ON BOBBY and his reaction as Samia goes on:
C: SAMIA
D: ... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
C: CATHERINE
D: I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
N: She gets up and starts to move away.
C: SAMIA
D: But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
C: CATHERINE
D: You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
E: cutting her off
C: SAMIA
D: Well, I should hope not...
N: She leaves the room, with Bobby's eyes following her, and as Carl moves over to sit beside Rayette, Samia resumes to Fincher while the other friend moves in beside Bobby and tries to engage him in conversation.
C: SAMIA
D: Because obviously there are loftier classes of people that do establish a kind of relating, that's relatively free of...
E: CONT'D Etc.
N: ON CARL AND RAYETTE as she indicates Tita's dog, lying near the fireplace.
C: RAYETTE
D: What kind of doggy is that?
C: CARL
D: It's a Borzoi.
C: RAYETTE
D: Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
N: She calls across to Bobby, interrupting Samia.
C: RAYETTE
D: Remember, Bobby?! The little pussycat you gave me?!
E: CONT'D
N: Bobby, now feeling trapped by the other friend, looks across to her ass she returns her attention to Carl.
C: RAYETTE
D: She had four little white paws, an' oh, was I crazy over her. We hadda go an' leave her one time at some friends, an' she went out an' got smashed flatter'n a tortilla right outside their mobile home.
E: CONT'D
N: Samia gestures toward Rayette as if she were an example to prove her point.
C: SAMIA
D: There. You see what I mean?
N: Bobby looks over at Samia.
C: SAMIA
D: The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
E: CONT'D
C: RAYETTE
D: Well, she was.
C: SAMIA
D: Perhaps...
N: She addresses Fincher gesturing toward Rayette again.
C: SAMIA
D: But you see how close that is to what I'm trying to...
E: CONT'D
N: Bobby stands up, cutting her off:
C: BOBBY
D: Don't sit there pointing at her.
C: SAMIA
D: I beg your pardon.
C: BOBBY
D: I said, don't point at her like that! What gives you the right to sit there and tell anybody about class and who the hell's got it, and what she typifies! You shouldn't even be in the same room with her, you creep!
E: advancing on her
C: SAMIA
D: Carl, this is really too much...
C: BOBBY
D: You're totally full of shit!
E: to Samia
C: CARL
D: Robert, I think you better just...
C: BOBBY
D: You're all full of shit!
E: cutting him off
N: He turns away and exits the room.
S: INT. DUPEA HOME - NIGHT
N: FOLLOWING WITH BOBBY running up the stairs and down the hall to Catherine's room. He goes inside and, not finding her, comes quickly back into the hall. As he moves down it, opening other doors, he begins calling her name. He comes back down the stairs and runs into Rayette at the bottom landing.
C: RAYETTE
D: Bobby...
C: BOBBY
D: I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
E: moving past her
N: He moves to the music room, to the den, then down the main hall to the kitchen, which gives off to two other doors. He opens one of them, to see:
S: INT. SPICER'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Tita and Spicer. Though both are clothed, they are caught in some stage of intimacy on top of Spicer's bed. Tita sits up immediately, mortally embarrassed, as Bobby steps into the room.
C: BOBBY
D: Tita, what the hell are you doing?!
N: Spicer stands up.
C: SPICER
D: Hey, this is my room.
C: BOBBY
D: What's going on here!?
E: moving over to the bed
C: TITA
D: It's none of your business!
C: BOBBY
D: Where's Catherine?!
C: TITA
D: I don't know where she is!
N: Spicer moves to Bobby, taking hold of his arm.
C: SPICER
D: Don't you believe in knocking, pal?
N: Bobby roughly pushes him away and advances on Tita.
C: BOBBY
D: I'm talking to you, Tita!
C: TITA
D: Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
E: close to tears
C: SPICER
D: Come on now, out!
E: grabbing hold of him again
C: BOBBY
D: Keep your fucking hands off my sister, nurse!
E: struggling with him
N: Spicer goes into sudden rage, pushing Bobby violently toward the door and yelling:
C: SPICER
D: Did you hear me! Move out!!
N: Bobby leaps at him and as their struggle carries them into the kitchen, Tita begins yelling:
C: TITA
D: Stop it! Bobby, will just you stop! I mean it!
N: Spicer gets Bobby into a painful headlock and is being bulled around the kitchen by him.
C: SPICER
D: Hold it, just hold it!!
N: They crash into the kitchen table, knocking chairs over.
C: TITA
D: Carl! Somebody get Carl!
N: Bobby rams Spicer into the refrigerator.
C: SPICER
D: Take it easy, dammit!
N: He hurls him against the kitchen wall, still holding him in a headlock as Tita enters the kitchen.
C: TITA
D: Stop it! Right now! Just stop it!! Carl!!
N: And as she runs from the room, Spicer begins violently jerking his forearm up against Bobby's trachea, punctuating each jerk with the repeated command:
C: SPICER
D: Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!
N: He feels Bobby's body slacken. He releases him and Bobby drops to the floor as... ... Carl, Catherine and Tita run into the kitchen, looking to: Bobby, gasping for air, tries to get up from the floor, and unable to, slumps back against the kitchen wall.
C: TITA
D: Oh God, Bobby, look what you've done...
N: He looks past her, to Catherine.
C: BOBBY
D: I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.
S: EXT. BAYFRONT - DAY
N: Catherine and Bobby sit on a low stone wall bordering the Dupea property. Each is staring out at the ocean, and after a moment:
C: CATHERINE
D: No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
C: BOBBY
D: Just give me a chance, will you?
C: CATHERINE
D: I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you... I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
E: she looks at him
N: Profoundly wounded, he looks away from her.
C: BOBBY
D: And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
C: CATHERINE
D: Yes.
C: BOBBY
D: That'll make you happy.
E: looking back to her
C: CATHERINE
D: I hope it will, yes. I'm sorry.
E: she pauses, then:
N: Needing to distance herself from witnessing his pain, she gets up and moves OUT OF FRAME. His eyes move from her to look out over the bay and, after a brief silence, he softly utters:
C: BOBBY
D: Okay.
S: EXT. COUNTRY - DAY
N: Bobby pushes Nicholas's wheelchair along a path between fields of tall grasses and wildflowers. He stops and moves around to the front of the chair.
C: BOBBY
D: Are you cold?
N: He leans over to adjust the blanket covering Nicholas's legs and, hunkering down in front of him, glances around at the fields, searching for articulation:
C: BOBBY
D: I don't know if you'd be particularly interested in hearing anything about me. My life, I mean... Most of it doesn't add up to much... that I could relate as a way of life that you'd approve of...
E: CONT'D
N: He pauses briefly, then:
C: BOBBY
D: I'd like to be able to tell you why, but I don't really... I mean, I move around a lot because things tend to get bad when I stay. And I'm looking... for auspicious beginnings, I guess...
E: CONT'D
N: He breaks off again, resuming with evident difficulty.
C: BOBBY
D: I'm trying to, you know, imagine your half of this conversation... My feeling is, that if you could talk, we probably wouldn't be talking. That's pretty much how it got to be before. I left... Are you all right?
E: CONT'D another pause
N: He searches his father's face, entreating him for some kind of answer, some sign of response, and seeing none...
C: BOBBY
D: I don't know what to say...
E: CONT'D
N: ... he breaks down, barely able to utter the following:
C: BOBBY
D: Tita suggested that we try to... I don't know. I think that she... seems to feel we've got... some understanding to reach... She totally denies the fact that we were never that comfortable with each other to begin with... The best I can do, is apologize.
E: CONT'D pauses, trying to gain control
N: He looks silently at his father for a moment...
C: BOBBY
D: We both know I was never really that good at it, anyway...
E: CONT'D
N: ... then, bowing bis head:
C: BOBBY
D: I'm sorry it didn't work out.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
N: Bobby comes out the front door. He carries his suitcase and, as he descends the steps and moves across the drive... ... Tita, wearing gloves and holding a pair of gardening clippers, comes around the side of the house and calls out to him:
C: TITA
D: Bobby!
N: He sets the suitcase down as she comes toward him.
C: TITA
D: You're leaving?
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
C: TITA
D: You were going without saying goodbye?
C: BOBBY
D: I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
C: TITA
D: But what about me?
C: BOBBY
D: I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
E: smiling at her
N: She puts her arms around him and as she embraces him:
C: TITA
D: Just once in a while, call and tell me where you are, please...
C: RAYETTE'S VOICE
D: Watch the birdie!
N: They turn to see: Rayette, standing near the open trunk of Bobby's car, taking a Polaroid shot of them. Bobby returns his attention to Tita, kissing her.
C: BOBBY
D: Bye, now.
C: TITA
D: Bye, Robert.
E: tearing up
N: He picks up his suitcase and moves to the trunk, where Rayette is fussing with her camera. He puts the suitcase inside, closes the trunk and takes hold of her arm.
C: BOBBY
D: Come on.
C: RAYETTE
D: Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
E: resisting him
C: BOBBY
D: No, let's go...
N: She pulls free of him and, as she moves back toward Tita, Bobby can be seen getting into the driver's seat.
C: RAYETTE
D: I never got the chance to thank you all for your hospitality. You tell Carl for me, if any of you folks wanta come on down to our place anytime, you'd be more'n welcome...
C: TITA
D: Thank you, that's very nice.
C: RAYETTE
D: Bye bye, now.
N: She moves back to the car and gets in. ON TITA watching as Bobby's car pulls out of the drive and disappears onto the private road.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: As Bobby's car moves over a highway through the northern forests, RAYETTE'S VOICE is heard SINGING:
C: RAYETTE
D: "Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty/An' I'm thirsty for you with all my heart..."
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Rayette is seated close to Bobby, looking at him as she sings.
C: RAYETTE
D: "But don't love me/Then act as though we've never kissed/Oh, don't touch me..."
N: She leans closer and kisses him, then bringing her lips close to his ear:
C: RAYETTE
D: "Don't touch me..."
E: CONT'D
N: She kisses him again.
C: RAYETTE
D: "Don't touch me..."
E: CONT'D
N: And again.
C: RAYETTE
D: "Don't touch me..."
E: CONT'D
N: Her kisses become more fervent and insistent.
C: RAYETTE
D: "Oh, don't touch..."
E: CONT'D
N: He suddenly pushes her away.
C: BOBBY
D: Cut it out!
N: Grievously hurt by his gesture and expressive of an anger she's heretofore been afraid to reveal:
C: RAYETTE
D: Son of a bitch, Bobby! You quit pushin' me away like that! I've had enough a that to last me a lifetime!
N: She makes a fist of her hand as though she were about to hit him, then changes her mind.
C: RAYETTE
D: Whyn't you just try an' be good to me for a change!?
E: CONT'D
N: There is no response. She turns away from him, looking out through the windshield for a moment, then:
C: RAYETTE
D: There id'n anyone gonna look after you an' love you better'n I do, you know that.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks over at him.
C: RAYETTE
D: Baby? Did you hear me?
E: CONT'D
N: There is no response.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
N: ON BOBBY'S CAR as it turns off the highway and pulls up into a gas station next to roadside cafe.
S: INT. BOBBY'S CAR - DAY
N: ON RAYETTE searching through her purse.
C: RAYETTE
D: I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
C: BOBBY
D: No.
C: RAYETTE
D: You got any change?
N: He searches into his jacket, takes out his wallet and hands it to her.
C: RAYETTE
D: Don't you just have 50 cents or somethin'?
E: CONT'D
N: He shakes his head.
C: RAYETTE
D: Okay, be right back...
E: CONT'D
N: She reaches to the door and opens it.
S: EXT. BOBBY'S CAR - DAY
N: Bobby gets out of the car as the station attendant approaches. Rayette turns back to him as she nears the front of the cafe.
C: RAYETTE
D: Sure you don't want anything?
C: BOBBY
D: Fill it up.
E: to attendant
N: The attendant moves to the pumps, and as Bobby crosses toward the men's room and disappears inside, a Peterbilt semi can be seen pulling into the station.
S: INT. GAS STATION - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
N: Bobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the waste container. He moves to the wash basin and stands a moment, gazing absently down at it, his mind searching for that inward oblivion in which nothing much is demanded, nothing much felt. Then, leaning over and placing his hands on the rim of the basin... ... he lifts his gaze to the mirror and, after minutely perusing the features of his face, looks into his own eyes as he had into his fathers, silently beseeching them for guidance.
S: EXT. MEN'S ROOM - GAS STATION - DAY
N: (SOUND OF SEMI'S MOTOR OVER:) REMOTE ANGLE as Bobby comes out of the men's room. He has left his jacket inside and stands for a moment, looking at the... ... DRIVER, bending down to check the undercarriage of the semi. As he stands up and circuits the front of the truck, heading for the cab:
C: BOBBY
D: Hey, wait a minute.
E: faintly audible
N: He moves over to him and after a brief exchange, the driver nods his bead and continues on to the cab, Bobby moves to the passenger door and climbs up into the pass seat.
S: INT. SEMI CAB - GAS STATION - DAY
N: The driver glances over at Bobby:
C: DRIVER
D: Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
C: BOBBY
D: No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
C: DRIVER
D: I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
C: BOBBY
D: No, it's okay.
C: DRIVER
D: Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
C: BOBBY
D: It's all right. I'm fine.
N: The driver puts the truck into gear and releases the brake.
C: BOBBY
D: I'm all right.
E: CONT'D
N: And as the truck begins to move forward:
C: BOBBY
D: I'm fine.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. SEMI - GAS STATION - DAY
N: REMOTE ANGLE: The semi pulls out of the station onto the highway, giving view to Bobby's car. The attendant is cleaning the windshield and Rayette can be seen opening the passenger door. As she gets out and surveys the area for some sign of Bobby, the semi MOVES INTO VIEW, going north on the highway. Rayette looks over the hood of the car, addressing the attendant. He gestures toward the men's room and as she moves across the station and disappears OFF THE SCREEN... ... the semi recedes in the distance, leaving a black trail of smoke from its exhaust stack, dissipating in the air. THE END
