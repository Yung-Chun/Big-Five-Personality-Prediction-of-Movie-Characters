T: FADE IN:
S: INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American high school...
C: 1A ANOTHER CORRIDOR 1A
D: ...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music. 1B INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 1B The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light from an open door...
C: MATT
D: This is unwatchable. It's not even in focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. This is really shoddy work. 1C INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY 1C The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: Why do they always show the guy's face? It's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it? We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.
E: O.S.
C: FRED
D: Because they're trying to make us feel like we're better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her.
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: How the hell do you know?
E: O.S.
C: FRED
D: It's a basic rule of porno. Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON. They're watching the porno... INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.
E: O.S.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2.
C: DEACON
D: It all started on my seventeenth birthday with our usual morning routine: film appreciation. The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.
E: V.O.
C: FRED
D: Deacon! What are you doing? I was watching that.
C: DEACON
D: Come on, let's go. We're going to be late.
C: DEACON
D: And when I say film appreciation, I mean film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt copies them, and I sell them. Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's. The original plus four copies pop out. CLOSE ON the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to Deacon. They smile. INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY The guys are waiting in line for lunch.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: Fred's the kind of kid who's basically given up on high school. He figures his glory days are way ahead of him.
E: V.O.
C: FRED
D: First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law, then when I'm making a hundred grand a year, I'll have a whole stable of hot chicks sitting around topless on my yacht. He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.
C: MATT
D: Will that work?
E: to Deacon
C: DEACON
D: You are a complete moron. Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.
E: to Fred
C: FRED
D: What?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3.
S: INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image that reads "Fifteen Days Till Midterms." Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking towards him.
C: DEACON
D: Until that big payday, Fred's sex life consists of spanking it.
E: V.O.
C: AMAZING GIRL
D: That test was sooo hard. That's too much for Fred to take. He adjusts his pants, turns ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for: INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there, then enters a stall and locks the door. He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the toilet seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles. INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.
C: HOT GIRL
D: We're going to be late. Are you coming? Fred perks up. INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY Fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector.
C: DEACON
D: Fred averages two to five time a day, depending on how many girls he sees in the hallway. INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY Matt is videotaping the students running down the hallway to class. Fred watches.
E: V.O. including J.T. and Mark
C: DEACON
D: Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete dork.
E: V.O.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4. J.T. and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping him off. Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing. Fred shakes his head.
C: FRED
D: What are you doing?
C: MATT
D: All great directors start this way. I'm documenting the essence of high school. Teenagers running to meet their destiny only to find it's just home room. It's very existential.
C: FRED
D: So's my balls. See you later.
S: INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOMS - DAY
N: Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to his bloody nose.
C: DEACON
D: In the normal course of things, Matt probably wouldn't even have been our friend, but Fred likes having someone to boss around, and I think Matt's actually pretty cool once you get to know him. Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and the door to the locker room closes slowly. Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK, a sliver of daylight still visible. Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be. He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.
E: V.O.
C: 10A MATT'S POV 10A
D: The proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras. Panties. Towels...
C: 10B REVERSE ANGLE 10B
D: Matt's eyes widen. And then, they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly scurries away.
C: DEACON
D: Well, at least he's got the key to the A/V room.
E: CONT'D; V.O.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 5.
S: INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN.
C: DEACON
D: Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot more than twenty dollars.
C: DORKY FRESHMAN
D: Sweet. He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away. Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.
C: DEACON
D: People always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have to watch one more TV movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness... Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some books for class.
E: V.O.
C: DEACON
D: I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it. INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina. PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but really staring at...
E: CONT'D; V.O. CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. I don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex. ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.
E: V.O.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 6.
C: BIOLOGY TEACHER
D: ... the increase in the hormone testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent male...
E: in the background
C: DEACON
D: We're suffering. Suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had. Teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode.
E: V.O.
C: BEHIND DEACON
D: Two GUYS are whispering. GUY 1 Did you hear about Rachael? GUY 2 No, what happened? GUY 1 John Baldwin nailed her. Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned.
C: DEACON
D: Are you talking about Rachael Unger? GUY 1 Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's party. In the bathroom.
C: DEACON
D: You're kidding. INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state of undress.
E: crushed FLASHBACK
C: DEACON
D: Rachael! What are you doing? She sits up and strikes a sexy pose.
C: RACHAEL
D: We've been together for a year now, and I thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level. Deacon is becoming very nervous.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 7.
C: DEACON
D: Now?
C: RACHAEL
D: You've been talking about this for months.
C: DEACON
D: I didn't think you were listening to me. Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious.
C: RACHAEL
D: Don't you want to?
C: DEACON
D: Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't have anything... She pulls out a condom.
C: RACHAEL
D: I do. But he's still hesitating.
C: RACHAEL
D: Deacon, what's the problem? Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the taking. An eternity passes. Then,
E: CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: I have a math test tomorrow. INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to describe the John Baldwin incident.
E: END FLASHBACK
C: DEACON
D: "I have a math test tomorrow." The bottom line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't know why, I just couldn't. And I've cursed myself every day since then. Deacon is suddenly... INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is nothing compared to how he feels when he looks
E: V.O.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 8.
C: DOWN THE HALLWAY
D: and sees Rachael at her locker, hugging some people good-bye . Rachael looks down the hallway towards Deacon, but Deacon ducks away. Now he's even more embittered. EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after school.
E: including a good-looking guy who must be JOHN BALDWIN
C: FRED
D: Did you videotape it?
C: MATT
D: Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with me.
E: sarcastically
C: FRED
D: You are the biggest moron I have ever known. Just then, Deacon comes up to them.
C: DEACON
D: Hey, guys. Here's the money. He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts.
C: MATT
D: Something wrong? Deacon lets out a deep breath.
C: DEACON
D: Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with John Baldwin.
C: FRED
D: Well, you had your chance. I told you to seal that deal.
C: DEACON
D: Shut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing any deals.
C: FRED
D: I'm biding my time.
C: DEACON
D: Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 9.
C: FRED
D: It doesn't get any better than that. You and Rachael were perfect for each other. And naked girls don't just appear out of thin air. "I have a math test tomorrow."
E: scoffs
C: DEACON
D: Will you shut up already? Look, I've been thinking about this all day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.
E: beat
C: MATT
D: So? They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.
C: DEACON
D: So we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls. This year is our year. There's nothing holding us back any more. Over in the parking lot, JAKE, a studly senior, revs the engine on his truck. Two hot girls, KELLY and WENDY, sit on his bumper, chatting.
E: takes the chain off his bike
C: DEACON
D: You see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. That could be us.
E: CONT'D
C: FRED
D: That's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever.
C: DEACON
D: Why not? All we have to do is follow the simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar Face."
C: MATT
D: Ooh. Good movie.
C: DEACON AND MATT
D: "First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women."
E: with Cuban accents
C: FRED
D: So, we're going to become Cuban drug lords?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 10.
C: DEACON
D: Listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. When I get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. Then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls. Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then, the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.
C: JAKE
D: Bye, Sphincter! They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.
C: FRED
D: Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it.
C: DEACON
D: I had a stomach virus, asshole. Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and bends over to pick them up.
C: FRED
D: Oh, that's just not fair. Fred adjusts himself.
S: INT. VIDEO CASA DEL RUSS A.K.A. RUSS'S VIDEO MAGIC - DAY
N: Fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc.) and waves to RUSS, the scraggly owner of this small video rental store. Fred passes J.T., Mark, Wendy, and Kelly and a bunch of other CUSTOMERS on his way to the back section of the store.
C: ADULT SECTION
D: Fred makes sure Russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno section. Hurriedly, he pulls out "Half-Cyborg 5: Final Showdown" from his book bag. But inside the case is the tape for "Dirty Darla #7." He makes the switch. Fred sighs a breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult section...
C: MAIN AREA
D: ...right into...
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 11.
C: RUSS
D: Gotcha! Fred SCREAMS.
C: RUSS

E: CONT'D
C: RUSS
D: Those movies aren't for little monkey- boys!
E: CONT'D
C: FRED
D: Aaaaaahhhhhhhh! The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free, and Russ chases after him.
C: RUSS
D: Come back here, you bastard! Russ runs after him and DIVES at Fred's legs, knocking him and entire shelf of tapes over. The tape FLY EVERYWHERE. Fred is still SCREAMING. Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear. A crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle.
C: RUSS
D: What else you got in here? Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for more tapes. Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an iron grip and keeps him away. Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming Lotion, Q-tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves... Wendy and Kelly are completely grossed out.
E: CONT'D
C: RUSS
D: What's this for? ...and a Barbie-type DOLL with a pullstring. Russ pulls it.
E: CONT'D totally confused
C: DOLL

S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
N: Deacon drives the DMV Tester Car under the watchful eye of the DMV TESTER.
C: DEACON
D: And I signal exactly two hundred feet before the turn. Rule 108-1. The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless.
C: DMV TESTER
D: Great. Now after the right, I want you to parallel park in the open space. Deacon complies.
C: DEACON
D: I begin the parallel parking maneuver by pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle. I now shift into reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise... The Tester rubs his brow. INT. DMV - DAY
C: FLASH!
D: Deacon's picture is taken. He passed.
S: INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - DAY
N: It's dark, but suddenly the lights come on.
C: EVERYONE
D: Surprise! Deacon pretends to be surprised.
C: DEACON
D: Wow. This is great. The room is sparsely populated with a few of Deacon's RELATIVES, his MOM and DAD, younger brother MAX , and ROGER, a wheelchair-bound nerd with a face full of orthodontic headgear and braces.
E: 14
C: MATT
D: Were you surprised?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 13.

D: Yeah.
C: MATT
D: Really?
C: DEACON

C: MR. LEWIS
D: Are you ready for the big present?
C: DEACON
D: You mean there's more? Deacon can hardly contain his excitement.
E: laying it on thick
C: MR. LEWIS
D: It's in the garage. Come with us. He follows them, looking back knowingly at Fred and Matt. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY The door opens, the lights come on, and Deacon's face drops. No new car. Instead, several large wrapped boxes. Deacon halfheartedly rips open the paper.
E: CONTINUOUS
C: MR. LEWIS
D: It's a new computer system. You've been talking about it for months. But his Mom can see his expression.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: What? That's not what you wanted?

D: No, it is. It's just--
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 14.
C: MAX
D: I'll take it.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Max!
C: MR. LEWIS
D: We can exchange it if it's not the right one.
C: DEACON
D: No, I just thought-- I thought you guys were buying me that car I wanted. Max snickers.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: A car? Why do you need a car?
C: MR. LEWIS
D: You can ask permission to use our car whenever you want, champ. They put their arms around Deacon and smile warmly. Deacon looks over at his parents' Aerostar Minivan. Everyone moves back into the house, except Deacon's parents, who linger.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: I told you he didn't want a new computer.
E: CONT'D
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Like you know what anyone in this house really wants. INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The guys set up the computer. Deacon is really depressed.

D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: You invited more people?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 15.
C: FRED
D: Well, we did send out flyers to like three hundred people from school.
C: DEACON
D: And no one showed up?
C: ROGER
D: I did. Deacon looks back at Roger.
C: DEACON
D: Great.
C: ROGER
D: Uh, guys. No one showed up because they're all at Tom Cooperman's house. He's having a keg party.
C: FRED
D: What? Why didn't I hear about this? That shit's not right.
C: ROGER
D: I heard it from Rahim. He beamed me the 411 in study hall. A beat. Deacon's anger turns to action.
C: DEACON
D: Let's go.
C: MATT
D: Why?
C: FRED
D: Yeah. Tom Cooperman kicked me in the balls in third grade, and I swear there is still a footprint on my nutsack.
C: DEACON
D: Come on, guys. Can I just get one thing that I ask for on my goddamn birthday?
C: MATT
D: He's got a point.
C: FRED

C: COOP
D: Grommets!
E: ad lib
C: DEACON
D: Hey, Coop. Can we come in? Coop un-pockets a tiny piece of paper with a thousand names on it. He examines it for a long time.
C: COOP
D: Sorry, son, that dog won't hunt. Y'all ain't on the list. He goes to close the door. Deacon stops it with his foot. Fred flinches.
C: DEACON
D: Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me some slack, all right? Coop looks him over, then opens the door.
C: COOP
D: Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you say so? Happy birthday, friend. The guys look at each other, excited. They look back at Roger, five feet behind them at the bottom of the steps.

C: DEACON
D: Oh, my God. There's Naomi.
E: in a trance
C: FRED
D: She looks good. And there's NAOMI, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot party dress and drinking a cup of beer. Someone lightly bumps her... CLOSE ON her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the world goes still . She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin with the back of her hand. She turns her head and her hair floats in the air.
C: DEACON AND FRED
D: are zombies, completely mesmerized by her.
C: FRED
D: She spilled her beer.

D: Your dignity?
C: DEACON

E: O.S.
C: JAKE
D: Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger? Before Deacon can answer...

C: JAKE
D: Whatever.
C: NAOMI
D: Whatever. Jake gives Deacon a dirty look, nods a "let's go" to J.T. and Mark, and heads out back.
C: NAOMI
D: What an asshole. As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi, but she's already gone, stranding Deacon. What just happened here? REVEAL Matt helping Roger drink a beer in the background.
E: CONT'D
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 19.
S: EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER
N: Deacon wanders out back. It's very dark and there are several people in the pool, including Jake's good-looking friends, Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK. It's hard to tell in the dark water, but it looks like they might not be wearing any clothes. Deacon sees this and starts to walk away.
C: J.T.
D: Deacon. I heard it was your birthday. Come on in the pool, man.
C: DEACON
D: No, that's okay.
C: MARK
D: No, seriously. It's cool.
C: KELLY
D: Come on, Deacon.
E: come hither
C: WENDY
D: Yeah. Come on. Deacon thinks about it. He takes the metaphorical plunge.
C: DEACON
D: All right. He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on.
C: MARK
D: Dude, what are you doing? Take off your clothes.
C: DEACON
D: What?
C: WENDY
D: We're skinny dipping, Deacon. He hesitates, not sure what to do.
C: DEACON
D: Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys alone then--
C: KELLY
D: --No, come on in. Join us. Wendy swims into J.T.'s arms. Her shoulders rise above the water and you can just make out the top of her breast.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 20.
C: DEACON
D: looks at her, thinks it over, and finally... slips off his shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.
C: DEACON
D: Wow. This feels amazing. Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles.
C: JAKE
D: Coop's doing funnels. Come on. It's Jake, by the side of the pool with Deacon's clothes. The other people swim to the front, and get out of the pool... ...wearing clothes! Even Wendy, in a strapless bra.
E: O.S.
C: J.T.
D: Sorry, dude.
E: rubbing it in
C: DEACON
D: Hey, give me back my clothes!
C: JAKE
D: Freakin? I can't see you. Maybe I need to turn on the LIGHTS. And he does. The backyard lights go on illuminating the scene. Deacon panics. People start looking at him, laughing. Then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing slowly. Deacon is humiliated. Jake bends down to whisper to Deacon.
C: JAKE
D: Did you really think Naomi was into you? Deacon doesn't respond. But it's not enough for Jake. He picks up Deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon shit his pants again!
E: CONT'D

D: No, I didn't! Give them back! Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's underwear on the stick. Everybody is laughing.

N: The Dog is right behind him. Deacon struggles with him.
C: DEACON
D: Hey, watch the nads! But it's no use. The dog BITES the front of the pool toy and it starts to deflate... ... just as the HEADLIGHTS of a car pull into the driveway. Deacon FREEZES. He desperately tries to cover himself with the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie hummer. A MAN gets out of the car.
C: COOP'S DAD

C: FRED
D: There's a small problem.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 22.
C: MATT
D: What?
C: FRED
D: I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and went berserk. Some sort of sting operation he's been planning for months. I don't know.
C: DEACON
D: You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're kidding.
C: FRED
D: No. And now I have to work twice a week at my dad's office. I told you this Scarface plan was stupid.
C: DEACON
D: Great. So now we've got no girls, no car, and no money.
C: FRED
D: And no porn.
C: MATT
D: Tony Montana would be very disappointed. Deacon is once again... INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY ... very depressed, as he sits, bored out of his mind in his biology class.
C: BIOLOGY TEACHER
D: Now turn your textbooks to chapter six, the Animal Kingdom. As you should know by now, biology is the study of life, in all its infinite varieties. Deacon continues to stare at her perpetually hard nipples.
C: BIOLOGY TEACHER
D: So to keep things a little fun around here, tomorrow we're taking a field trip to the zoo. Deacon buries his head in his hands. EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY Deacon is talking to the Dorky Freshman near the bike rack.

D: Is this some kind of extortion racket? I'll pay you double if you can get me something today.
C: DEACON
D: I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for a while. We don't have anything new.
C: DORKY FRESHMAN
D: I'm dying. I just need something. Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot.
C: DEACON
D: Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?
C: NAOMI
D: Going home to cram for midterms. With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork.
C: DEACON
D: Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you needed any help.
C: NAOMI
D: That's okay. I'll be all right. Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack by asking,
C: NAOMI
D: So where did Rachael go off to?
E: CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: She went to Paris with the French Club. We're seeing other people. She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the difference. He relaxes...
E: then, taking a chance
C: JAKE
D: Hey, sphincter. ... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi.
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: Look, can you please stop calling me that? I think we're old enough to just let it go. All right?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 24.
C: JAKE
D: Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants. He looks at Naomi.
C: JAKE
D: Hi, Naomi.
E: CONT'D
C: NAOMI
D: Whatever. She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades. He revs the engine and peels out BACKWARDS. Deacon jumps out of the way, but his bike is CRUSHED by the car.
C: JAKE
D: Oops. Sorry. He shifts gears and drives over the bike again. He laughs as he drives away. Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks away. The moment is gone. Now Deacon is... INT. AEROSTAR - DAY ... pissed. His crushed bike is in the back seat.
C: DEACON
D: Look, mom. I need a car.
E: emphatic
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: But I thought we agreed--
C: DEACON
D: I need a car of my own.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Well, honey. A car is a lot of responsibility.
C: DEACON
D: Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I can handle it.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell you what. Maybe you can get an after school job to earn money for a car. I'll talk to your father. Deacon is stewing.

E: excited including Deacon's biology class
C: BIOLOGY TEACHER

C: DEACON
D: That's when it hit me. Just then, a glob of "something" shoots out towards the crowd . Everyone ducks, except for Roger, who's can't move quickly enough in his wheelchair. It hits him in the face, dripping down his orthodontia.

E: V.O.

C: DEACON
D: Let's make one.
C: MATT
D: One what?
C: DEACON
D: A movie.
C: MATT
D: Great! That's perfect! I've already got an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror thing. It's like "The Shining" meets "The Jetsons."
C: DEACON
D: No, you moron. A porno film. Fred lights up.
C: FRED
D: Even better.
C: DEACON
D: And check this out. The best part of all, is I've got an angle.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.
C: FRED
D: What kind of angle?
C: DEACON
D: We can make pornos that cater to guys like us.
C: FRED
D: You mean virgins.
C: DEACON
D: Yes. Adult films made by virgins for virgins.
C: MATT
D: With good cinematography.
C: FRED
D: And cute, nice girls. The kind you'd want to take to dinner with your parents.
C: DEACON
D: Right. No shots of sweaty guys' faces.
C: FRED
D: And nothing up the butt. They look at him.
C: FRED
D: What? I don't like it when they put stuff up their butt.
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: These have to be nicely edited. We should shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.

C: FRED
D: How are we going to get the women to star in the film?
C: MATT
D: And the guys.
C: DEACON
D: I don't know. We'll surf the net. We'll figure it out. They look at each other for a beat. Finally, Fred and Matt crack up.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 28.
C: DEACON
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: FRED
D: That was really funny. Deacon just looks at them, pissed.
C: DEACON

C: DEACON
D: Do you have any idea how much money we'd make? A beat.
C: MATT
D: Like how much?
C: DEACON
D: Enough for a car. Enough for more camera shit. To take girls out. I don't know. For whatever we want. Beat. Beat. Beat. They're thinking about it.
C: FRED
D: What about the moral implications?
C: DEACON
D: It's a free market transaction between consenting adults. What's the problem?
C: FRED
D: We're not adults.
C: MATT
D: He's got a point, Deacon.
C: DEACON
D: Guys, tell me the truth. Haven't you ever wondered... haven't you ever imagined what it would be like to make one?
C: MATT
D: Not really. Deacon turns to Fred, who looks guilty.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 29.
C: FRED
D: Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've thought about shaving Principal Taggert's ass, too. A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal.
C: DEACON
D: Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. We'll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going to waste another minute. I'm making this porno movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew it." Ringing silence.
C: MATT
D: That was a really good speech, Deacon.
E: sincerely
C: DEACON
D: Thanks.
C: MATT
D: Did you work that out before?
C: DEACON
D: No, Matt.
C: FRED
D: Okay... So say we were to do this. What would we call our company?

C: VIC
D: So, you think you can just walk into my town and move in on my territory? The Man takes a quick look down at his own crotch, fearing the worst. He shakes his head, pleading through his gag. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY The guys are huddled behind the frosted window of Fred's dad's office, standing away from the RECEPTIONIST.
C: FRED
D: We've got to have two forms of i.d. to prove she's over eighteen.
C: DEACON

C: FRED
D: A first time porno actress makes only two fifty to five hundred bucks.
C: MATT
D: That's it? Does that include the sex?
C: DEACON
D: Yes, Matt.
C: MATT
D: So how do we get women for this movie?
C: FRED
D: We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press for "body models." That's like some sort of code word in the industry.
C: MATT
D: Are we supposed to have sex with these women?
C: DEACON
D: No, Matt. A NURSE walks in.
C: NURSE
D: Fred, your father wants you to take these urine samples down to the lab.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 32.

C: GREITZER
D: I'm Ronald Greitzer here for my 4:00 appointment.

D: Okay, Mr. Greitzer. I'll let the doctor know you're here for your... rectal exam. Have a seat. He leaves and Fred looks at Deacon, mischievously.
E: checks the book
C: DEACON
D: No way.
C: FRED
D: Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr. Greitzer's signature on file, his credit card number, and his social security number... A beat.
C: DEACON
D: And he'll never find out?
C: FRED
D: It's not like we're going to send him our annual report. It'll just be like an official name of record or something.
C: DEACON
D: Okay. Cool. The Nurse returns.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 33.
C: NURSE
D: And take these fecal and semen samples, too. She hands Fred two more containers, and the guys exit. 41A EXT. STREET - DAY 41A The guys ride their bikes towards the lab to deliver the samples.
C: FRED
D: And we need porno names.
C: DEACON
D: What do you mean?
C: FRED
D: It's a basic rule of porno. All people affiliated with the production of an adult film have porno names so their friends don't recognize them.
C: MATT
D: Oh, you mean like "Johnny Hardmember"?
C: FRED
D: Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls McLongcock.
C: MATT
D: Ooh, I like it.
C: DEACON
D: Guys. Those kind of names are just for the actors.
C: MATT
D: You're just jealous that you don't have a cool porno name like us.
C: DEACON
D: Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ... Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man. Matt and Fred look at each other, then Deacon.
E: searching
C: MATT
D: That name sucks.
C: FRED
D: You don't get it, do you? A porno name needs to be a very subtle thing. Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over the ground.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 34.
C: DEACON
D: Sorry, Balls. I guess I'm still new at this.
C: FRED
D: Matt, pick that up. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT The family dinner.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: And I'm telling the guy, he's got to use form ND-45 for a third-party beneficiary, but Johnson's gotta be the big man. "We've been using ND-90 for twenty-two years." But Johnson's an idiot. He doesn't know ND-90 doesn't even exist anymore. Mom yawns. The phone rings and she gets it.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Hello? Deacon, it's for you. It's a young lady named Palomina. Deacon CHOKES on his food. He gets up quickly and grabs the phone. Max is eyeballing him, so Deacon walks with the phone into the other room and talks softly.
E: covers phone
C: DEACON
D: Yeah. 345 Remson. That's right. Great. Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward to working with you, too. He hangs up and returns to the kitchen to see the whole family staring at him, curious.

E: including one TRANSVESTITE
C: MATT
D: When you have sex with a strange man, do you imagine it's like your boyfriend or something? She just looks at him.
C: DEACON
D: We're ready. Over. Matt picks up his walkie talkie.
E: O.S. over a walkie talkie
C: MATT
D: Roger. Over. He looks at his clipboard and turns to the first woman.

D: I been in some home movies. Stuff like that. Some pictures. She tosses a stack of Polaroids at them. The top one has her standing next to a horse. Fred is speechless.
C: DEACON
D: Okay, then. I think we have what we need. We'll call you. She's confused.
C: CRACK WHORE
D: So you don't want me to suck you two off? They look at each other.
C: DEACON
D: No, I don't think that will be necessary at this time.
C: FRED
D: Maybe later. INT. DEACON'S BASEMENT - LATER The whores are gone.
C: MATT
D: Maybe if we put another ad in and say we're only looking for good looking models.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 37. They look at him with disdain.
C: FRED
D: There's got to be another way to recruit porno actresses. INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
C: FLASH!
D: Three digital images of the guys are lined up on Deacon's computer monitor . Deacon is digitally altering the photo of Fred to give him a goatee. Matt's photo has already gotten mutton chops and Deacon's looking sweet with a fu-manchu.
E: thanks Mom and Dad!
C: DEACON
D: I say we make them from Hawaii.
C: MATT
D: Hawaii?
C: DEACON
D: It's perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii driver's license looks like?
C: MATT
D: No.
C: DEACON
D: Exactly.
C: FRED
D: But isn't it going to seem a little suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland?
C: DEACON
D: Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation in Hawaii, where do you think people from Hawaii go? Matt and Fred look at each other. They shrug, then,
C: MATT
D: Aloha. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT The next night. The three guys walk downstairs dressed in Hawaiian shirts. Deacon's parents are reading and Max is watching TV.

E: still in the garage
C: FRED
D: Are we really going to do this?
C: DEACON
D: Oh, yeah. He starts the ignition, and an EASY LISTENING tune blasts on the radio, ruining the moment. The guys look at each other for a beat, then Deacon quickly changes the station to a ROCKING SONG, and get back into the mood for adventure.
C: DEACON
D: Oh, yeah. They pull out and drive off. 49A EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT 49A The minivan descends out of the suburbs into the lights of the big city below. EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT CLOSE ON the Aerostar's bumper sticker: "My child is on the honor roll at William Wall High School."
E: CONT'D once again
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 39. The guys step out of the car and see for the first time the Holy Grail of boyhood fantasies: the neon outline of a topless woman at the entrance to this upscale strip club. They stop and stare for a beat, before finally getting up the nerve to walk up to a menacing BOUNCER sitting on a stool outside the entrance, reading "The Princess Diaries."
C: BOUNCER
D: I.d.'s. They confidently pull out the i.d.'s and hand them over.

D: We've got money. Deacon pulls out a wad of cash. The Bouncer looks around, then thinks about it for a second. INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT WE TRACK the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor towards the light. Each guy is in his own little world, Matt and Fred following Deacon as he takes the first nervous steps. First the neon lights hit them, then the smell of liquor and sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and finally the grinding blast of MUSIC, so powerful it seems to stop them in their tracks. Their eyes bug out. SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS walking by. As they move further into the club, they see actual STRIPPERS soliciting lap dances and some TOPLESS DANCERS onstage. Fred smiles ear to ear. The guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only by the voice of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
C: COCKTAIL WAITRESS
D: What'll you boys have? Two drink minimum.

C: AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
D: Are you boys interested in a dance? They look at each other.
C: FRED
D: Okay? She takes Fred's hand and walks him over to a private dance couch. As the next SONG starts, a curtain lowers around Fred and the Stripper. Fred is a little freaked out.

C: VIC
D: That's true. Vic regains his train of thought.

N: Deacon wakes up sick as a dog. All the shades are drawn, but Fred and Matt are already hard at work on the computer. They seem completely fine, with no signs of Deacon's hangover.
C: DEACON
D: What are you guys doing?
C: FRED
D: We came up with a great idea. We're going to presell the videos by posting the scripts on the website.
C: DEACON
D: Will that work?
C: MATT
D: I don't know. But it's kind of fun. We just wrote this whole thing about the girls' locker room.
C: FRED
D: One thing, though. If our motto is "by virgins, for virgins," I was thinking we should put a picture of one of us on the web site to sort of sell the image.
C: MATT
D: You're not putting my picture up there.
C: DEACON
D: It doesn't really have to be one of us, though, does it? He grabs the yearbook.
C: INSERT:
D: ROGER'S FACE, as Balls McLongcock, proudly displayed on the web site, hawking the first feature film of After School Special with the motto, "By Virgins, For Virgins." A quick knock on the door and Deacon's Mom comes in.

C: JAKE
D: What the hell's going on, Sphincter?
C: DEACON
D: What are you doing here?
C: JAKE
D: I saw the strippers. And some crack whore named Saffron came over my house the other day looking for you guys.
C: FRED
D: We don't know what you're talking about. Jake takes some pages off the printer.
C: JAKE
D: What's this? "Oh, my God. There's a boy at the door looking at us naked in the shower." He flips a page.
C: JAKE
D: "The A/V Club Secretary lathers all of their glistening bodies. 'I'm so dirty,' she moans." What the hell kind of crap is this? Are you guys running a whorehouse or something?
E: CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: No.
C: FRED
D: Are you crazy?
C: MATT
D: They're not whores if we film them, you moron. Deacon can't believe Matt just blew it. Fred smacks him.

C: DEACON
D: You can't prove anything.
C: JAKE
D: Who's the girl?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 48.

D: Well, maybe I could do it.
E: CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: No, that's not a good idea.

D: Why not?

D: It's a lot harder than it looks.
C: JAKE
D: You don't think I can do it? Trust me, I've nailed enough girls.
C: DEACON
D: Forget it.
C: JAKE
D: Look, you little butt munch. I want to do this, and if you don't let me, I'll go and tell your mommy what kind of sick shit you're doing. Jake looks him over. INT. BASEMENT SET AS "YEARBOOK OFFICE" - DAY
C: DARKNESS.
D: Click. The lights come on. The big day has come at last. The guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far away from Ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a conservative high school girl's outfit. The basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound equipment. A desk and decoration make the room look roughly like the high school yearbook offices. Deacon gives Matt a little shove, and Matt takes a long walk over to Ashley.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 49.
C: MATT
D: So, um, I'll be directing.
C: ASHLEY
D: Okay.
C: MATT
D: Okay. So I want you to play this very understated. It's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top.
C: ASHLEY
D: Uh huh. Hey, did you guys shave or something? Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless.
E: beat
C: DEACON
D: Okay. I think we're ready here. Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on.
C: MATT
D: Boom in position.
C: FRED
D: What? Deacon pushes him over to position.
C: MATT
D: Ashley, get into position. Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially. One last reality check before they take the leap.
C: FRED
D: Are we actually going to do this? They look over at Ashley. She's waiting.
C: DEACON
D: I guess so. They return to position.
C: MATT
D: So, um, we're starting with the masturbation and then Phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you.
C: ASHLEY
D: Okay.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 50.
C: MATT

C: ASHLEY
D: I hope no one catches me because I forgot to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah. FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling. DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts. MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Deacon whispers,
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: Close up.
C: MATT
D: What?
C: DEACON
D: Close up.
C: MATT
D: Oh yeah. Right. And Matt zooms in. Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands steady. 54A THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY 54A We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it's just a BLUR.

D: What? Did I so something wrong? Matt is quivering.
C: MATT
D: Uh, no. You were great. I think I've got what I need there. I want to set up for Jake.
C: FRED
D: I need a bathroom break.
C: DEACON
D: Not now, Fred. Jake. Jake comes out of the bathroom dressed as the yearbook editor.
C: MATT
D: Action. Jake opens a makeshift door to the office.
C: JAKE
D: Oh, my God. What are you doing?
E: wooden
C: ASHLEY
D: I couldn't help myself. Please don't tell the principal.
C: JAKE
D: Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
C: MATT
D: Cut. Perfect. Okay, then. Let's get to the, uh, sexual material. Jake pulls off his pants and starts to look a little nervous. He stands in the corner, trying to psyche himself up.
C: DEACON
D: Jake, you okay?
C: JAKE
D: Sure. No problem.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 52.
C: MATT
D: And ACTION! But Jake is still standing there, not in the shot. He's starting to sweat.

D: Action, Jake.
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: Okay. Still nothing.
C: DEACON
D: Come on, Jake. We're filming.
C: JAKE
D: All right. Hang on a second. He has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't risen. Fred lets the boom mike sag a bit.
C: FRED
D: My arm's getting tired.
C: ASHLEY
D: So's his.
C: MATT
D: Action... Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley.
C: ASHLEY
D: That's it?
C: JAKE
D: Hey, it's not hard yet.
C: ASHLEY
D: I can see that. Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye.
C: DEACON
D: Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him out. She grabs his joint and Jake freezes. He remains motionless, focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the floodgates closed. Approximately one point three seconds later...
C: ASHLEY
D: Aaaahhhh!
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 53.
C: MATT
D: Wait! I'm not set up for that shot!
C: FRED
D: Can I put down the boom?
C: DEACON
D: Jake? What's happened? Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts.
C: JAKE
D: This has never happened before. She got me too excited.
C: ASHLEY
D: Me? How did you ... without even getting hard first?
C: JAKE
D: What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor? Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay?
E: copping an attitude
C: DEACON
D: Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene again. Just relax. We can splice it together.
C: MATT
D: We'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage.
C: JAKE
D: I'm out of here. And if you dickwads tell anybody about this, first I'll kill you, and then I'll bust you guys. He pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and leaves.
C: ASHLEY
D: Now what? The guys regroup, away from Ashley. The moment of truth: How far are they willing to go?
C: MATT
D: Deacon. You do it.
C: DEACON
D: No way.

D: Oh, like you're the only one who can do that.
C: MATT
D: Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake of the film. Hold this. He hands the camera to Deacon and starts taking off his shirt. The rest of them look at Matt with his shirt off.
E: false bravado
C: DEACON
D: Matt. Stop it.
C: MATT
D: No, I'll do it. He desperately wants someone to hold him back.
C: FRED
D: Matt! They huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this.
E: grabs him
C: FRED

D: Cool. INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally.

C: MATT
D: Hey, guys. It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing. Deacon shoots them an annoyed look.

D: When we were going out, he was so mean to me all the time. I think he's compensating for his little dick that never even gets hard. Deacon chokes on his drink.
C: DEACON
D: Well at least you were smart enough to dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who will treat you ... I don't know. Really well.
C: NAOMI
D: You know what you are? Deacon gets a little nervous.

D: Deacon?
E: CONT'D
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 63.

D: I've been wanting to do that for a long time.

She likes it. AT A WINDOW, Jake sees them kissing. He doesn't like it. AT ANOTHER WINDOW, Fred sees it, too. And for a completely different reason, he doesn't like it either. INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY The set is finally ready: Ashley is lying on the bed in a robe, the lights and camera are set, and Matt and Fred are adjusting the video camera. The only thing missing is an actor. Deacon ENTERS.
C: DEACON
D: Hey, where's Coop?
C: FRED
D: He was supposed to be here a half hour ago.
C: MATT
D: Maybe he got sucked into a black hole. He chuckles to himself.
C: DEACON
D: Good one, Spock. I can't understand why you're not more popular with the ladies.
C: MATT
D: Look, we're wasting time. Deacon, why don't you just go in there? Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying there.
C: MATT
D: Come on...

D: Okay. Okay. All right already. He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box from out of nowhere.
C: MATT
D: And action!
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 64. Matt starts filming while Ashley pulls Deacon near her.
C: ASHLEY
D: Maybe I can pay for the pizza some other way... We hear Deacon's ZIPPER opening offscreen as Deacon rolls his eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: And maybe I could throw in the sausage for free. Deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below.
C: MATT
D: Fred, you get in there, too.
C: FRED
D: Are you sure?
C: MATT
D: Yeah, it'll be a great shot. Fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of the bed. Ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed. The two guys are facing each other.
C: FRED
D: Hey.

D: S'up?
C: FRED
D: How's it going? Deacon shrugs.
C: FRED
D: Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi about sun spots?

D: What?
C: MATT
D: You know. Make out with each other.
C: DEACON
D: What?
C: FRED
D: All right. Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused. Deacon holds him back with his hand.
C: DEACON
D: Wait. Why do you want us to kiss?
C: MATT
D: Because that's what guys do in gay porn.
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: What? Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC! He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex with. He can barely look. It's Matt!

D: More sausage please.

D: Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh! CUT TO: INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Deacon bolts up out of bed. Nightmare. Thank God. INT. BASEMENT SET AS "MOVIE THEATER" - DAY Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream: Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 66. The set is made up to look like a movie theater, complete with rows of seats, a bed sheet "screen," and a massive 5,000 watt light. Deacon is still a little agitated.
C: DEACON
D: Where the hell is Coop? There's no way I'm making out with Fred. Then Coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring at Deacon.
C: COOP
D: What's going on?
C: ASHLEY
D: Deacon is talking about making out with Fred.
C: FRED
D: No way. I'm holding the mike and that's it.

D: If you guys want to do gay porn, you still have to pay me.
C: DEACON
D: Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid dream I had.
C: MATT
D: You dreamed about making out with Fred?
C: DEACON
D: No. Well, yes. And we were both having sex with you. But it was just a dream so let's forget it. Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly changes the subject.
C: DEACON
D: What's with the light?
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: It's a "special effect." If you want this film to look amateurish, you're going to have to get someone else to do it.

D: Do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this?
E: CONT'D

C: COOP
D: Unplug the light! Deacon moves to unplug it.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 68.

C: MATT
D: Quick, get the fire extinguisher!
C: DEACON
D: Where is it?

D: Over there! He spots it in the corner and grabs it. Meanwhile the flames are growing. Deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames. He depresses the lever. Nothing.

C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Max sprained his wrist at soccer practice. What is going on here?

C: MR. LEWIS
D: So get this. Johnson comes up to me today and he's all like "where's the ND-90's?" I'm like, "Johnson, they discontinued the ND-90 like six weeks ago." I've been telling this guy...
C: ASHLEY
D: Johnson sounds like a moron.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Exactly! Mr. Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention to him. Mrs. Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal question, exactly how old are you?

C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Deacon, who is it? Too late. Naomi comes in.
E: O.S.
C: NAOMI
D: Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's girlfriend. And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his day. It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect.

E: she storms off
C: FOYER
D: Deacon watches Naomi go. Ashley consoles him.
C: ASHLEY
D: Let her go.
C: DEACON
D: Are you insane? I've been fantasizing about Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade.
C: ASHLEY
D: Fantasy and reality are two different things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with who you think she is. You have to be sure you love the real person.
C: DEACON
D: So what should I do?
C: ASHLEY
D: Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever. He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi. EXT. STREET - NIGHT Naomi and Deacon are arguing under a street light.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 74.
C: NAOMI
D: She's a porno actress in your porno film. She had to pretend to be your girlfriend because she ran upstairs naked when the light caused a fire. And you've never had sex with her or even kissed her.
C: DEACON
D: Yeah, pretty much. He looks down.
C: DEACON
D: So, I guess this means you're not my girlfriend anymore.

D: I want to come to the set tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: No, I don't think that's a good idea.
C: NAOMI

C: DEACON
D: Matt and Fred will get really mad. We're not supposed to tell anyone.
C: NAOMI
D: Tell them I'm a ... creative consultant. For the female point of view.
C: DEACON
D: No offense, but the female point of view doesn't really matter in these films. She looks at him, pouting.
C: DEACON
D: Okay. Okay. CLOSE ON a computer monitor displaying the A.S.S. Website.

D: Ronald J. Greitzer?
C: GREITZER
D: Yes. That's right. Then, a spark of understanding.
C: VIC
D: Oh, I get it. Brilliant. You're not even a fuckin' kid. Mike pulls the gun out and puts it to Greitzer's head. Greitzer drops his glass of soda, raises his hands, and starts shaking, terrified.
C: GREITZER
D: What are you doing?
C: VIC
D: What am I doing? I'm retiring you from the porno business. Permanently. Understand?
C: GREITZER
D: Yes. Yes. Please don't hurt me.

Greitzer's eyes dart over to the side, and for the first time, Vic steps into the house and sees: LITTLE GIRLS. It's Greitzer's little daughter's birthday party. Six-year- old GIRLS and their stunned PARENTS all stare at Vic. Greitzer's wife comes over, screaming and crying.

D: I'm sorry! I'll never rent them again! It was only that one time my wife was at her sister's! Please! I promise you!
C: GREITZER'S WIFE
D: You rented a dirty movie? You told me it was Jakob the Liar! Mike lowers the gun and they start backing out of there.
C: GREITZER
D: What? I shouldn't be entitled to a little joy in life?
C: GREITZER'S WIFE
D: Now look at the trouble you've brought to this house.
C: GREITZER
D: And I'm supposed to know the Religious Right would come after me for renting an adult film? As they continue to fight, Vic and Mike run back to the car. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY Dress rehearsals. Naomi is sitting at the kitchen table talking to Ashley, who's wearing a sexy cheerleader outfit. Deacon is at the microwave making popcorn.
C: NAOMI
D: Five hundred dollars a night?

D: Yeah, but if you can break into films, like these ones, you can get featured dancing gigs and make ten times that much.
C: NAOMI
D: No way.
C: ASHLEY
D: Seriously. If these guys ever get their act together. Matt stumbles in carrying a pile of scripts. Fred walks in behind him and sees Naomi.

D: What is she doing here?
C: DEACON
D: Naomi is my girlfriend.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 78. Fred exchanges a glance with Matt.

C: DEACON
D: What?
C: FRED
D: Fine. Whatever. Let's get started. I'm sure she'll be really helpful. Coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the Math Team Captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc.

C: COOP
D: Sort of.
E: sheepishly
C: MATT
D: Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try to do this with a little heart, okay? And action. Everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal.
C: ASHLEY
D: This quadratic equation is so hard.
C: COOP
D: Well, maybe we should just stick to long division. Coop drops his corduroys and Naomi gasps. She stares at Coop's "slide rule" for a beat, then snaps out of it.
C: NAOMI
D: Wait a second. Cut. This is all wrong. She wouldn't be fantasizing about some geek.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 79.
C: MATT
D: He's not a geek. He's the Math Team Captain.
C: NAOMI
D: No, he should be really well-dressed, and maybe he's a foreign exchange student from Portugal.
C: MATT
D: Um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say "cut."
C: FRED
D: Who cares, Naomi?
C: NAOMI
D: Deacon agrees with me, don't you? Matt and Fred look at Deacon.

E: swings his arms out
C: DEACON
D: Are you okay?
C: COOP
D: I'm sorry, Ashley. She's pissed, holding her nose.
C: ASHLEY
D: Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot?
C: MATT
D: Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and "improvise."
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 80.
C: ASHLEY
D: Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career. I've got no footage for my reel. She packs up.

D: Where are you going?
C: ASHLEY
D: Sorry. She leaves.
C: COOP
D: Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley! Then, he blurts out something unexpected:
C: COOP
D: I love you! Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his ankles and his bare ass in full display. He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. He gets up quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down.
E: CONT'D calling after her
C: FRED
D: Now what are we going to do? Your "girlfriend" ruined everything.
C: DEACON

C: NAOMI
D: Besides, if you losers knew anything about women, we wouldn't have this problem.
C: FRED
D: Who asked you?

C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Good. Good. That's very good. She gives Ashley a warm little hug.
C: ASHLEY
D: Listen, Mrs. Lewis. You don't have to worry about Deacon. He's a good kid. If you just let him make his own mistakes in life, he's going to turn out fine. INT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Deacon and Naomi are under the covers, making out.

D: That's okay. Just go slow. And he does. He's nervous at first, not sure what to do. But as she kisses him softly, suddenly we start to hear the slow fade in of PORNO MUSIC playing in Deacon's head. The music grows louder when:
E: Now that Deacon's actually having sex, it's involunarily triggering the only thing he knows about sex: porno movies.

She struts by each of the men in the front row, reaching down to take dollar bills out of their hands. She walks over to Deacon's Dad... ... but he's tipping the waitress. She does another spin around the pole... and lands in a split, face to face with... ... Deacon's Dad, who happens to have a crisp dollar bill between his teeth. They immediately recognize each other and FREEZE. A long beat. Then:
E: O.S.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Hello, naughty school girl whom I've never met before.
C: ASHLEY
D: You, too, are someone whose kitchen I've never been in. Another beat, then she grabs the bill out of his teeth, and quickly moves away. INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT Dad walks upstairs, still a little stunned.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: You get everything done at work?
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Yeah. All set.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Oh, guess who I ran into? Deacon's girlfriend, Ashley.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 90. Dad freezes.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Where did you see Ashley?
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Over on Industrial Way.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: You were on Industrial?
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: You know, she is so flexible. It's really amazing some of the positions that girl can twist herself into.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: What?!?
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: She even offered to teach me. So I could move like that.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Yeah, that would be great! I mean, if you're into that.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: Maybe. I like her. I know she's a little older, but I think she's good for Deacon.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: You do? Just then, Deacon walks past them down the hallway towards his bedroom. Dad eyes him with a rare combination of fatherly concern and male jealously. INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Deacon walks past his desk and something catches his eye. He stops to look at a picture of himself with Fred and Matt from fifth grade. He looks really happy in the picture. Then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures taken yesterday with Naomi. She's hamming it up for the camera, but you can tell from his expression, they don't belong together. He tosses the Naomi picture onto the desk. EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT Deacon stands by the water skipping rocks with Matt and Fred.
C: FRED
D: So, what did you want to talk to us about?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 91.
C: DEACON
D: I wanted to say I'm sorry.
C: FRED
D: For what?
C: DEACON
D: For blowing you guys off.
C: MATT
D: That's okay, Deacon.
C: DEACON
D: No, it's not. It's just sometimes I feel like the whole world is passing us by and we're just sitting still. I don't know. Anyway, I'm sorry.
C: FRED
D: You know, you can be a real dick sometimes. Then, Fred smiles. Deacon knows they're cool with each other.
C: DEACON
D: Naomi and I did it the other night.
C: MATT
D: No way!
C: FRED
D: You're kidding, right?
C: DEACON
D: No, it's true.
C: FRED
D: How was it?
C: DEACON
D: Good. At first. But then I kept thinking about all the pornos. Trying to hit the right spots, positions. I don't know. After a while it kind of seemed like work.
C: MATT
D: I find that extremely difficult to believe. Deacon laughs.
C: FRED
D: So what now? Do we make this thing?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 92.
C: DEACON
D: I don't know. Maybe we should just call it quits.
C: ASHLEY
D: Hey, guys. Ashley walks up to them. She looks hotter than ever, in a tiny midriff shirt and short shorts.
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: What are you doing here?
C: ASHLEY
D: I need you.
C: FRED
D: What?
C: ASHLEY
D: I need you to make this movie. For my reel.
C: DEACON
D: Well, actually we were--
C: ASHLEY
D: Ooh, look. An eyelash. For the third time, time stands still as Ashley gently pulls the errant eyelash from Deacon's eye and offers it up to him.
C: ASHLEY
D: Make a wish. Deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand. She smiles and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow. The guys are hooked. Up through the window, over on Deacon's computer, the A.S.S. Website is running, featuring Roger's smiling face with the motto, "By Virgins, For Virgins." The counter is on fire. INT. HAIRDRESSER - DAY Roger is getting his hair cut by a cute HAIRDRESSER, his wheelchair next to him. A few other women are in the back, whispering and looking over at Roger. An OPERA ARIA plays on the radio.
E: CONT'D
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: So, I'm thinking about getting into films.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 93.
C: ROGER
D: Okay.
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: You have any tips on how to break in?
C: ROGER
D: Uh, no. Not really. Acting classes, I guess.
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: Really? I didn't think there was a lot of acting in those films. Roger is confused.
C: ROGER
D: Well, I guess it kind of depends.
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: You think you could get me an audition?
C: ROGER
D: For what?
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: Come on. How long have I been cutting your hair?
C: ROGER
D: Since I was like eight.
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: I know who you are. Don't worry. Your secret's safe. Come on. I just want to make one film to see what it's like. Roger is still totally clueless.
E: whispers
C: ROGER
D: That's great. But how can I help you?
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: Oh, I get it. You help me, I have to help you. That's how it works. Okay. She looks around. Then, she sprays a big dollop of hair mousse into one hand and places it under the hair apron. ZIP. Roger panics.
C: HAIRDRESSER
D: Relax.
E: CONT'D
C: ROGER
D: What're you-- Oh, God!
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 94. His face contorts to match the aria playing on the radio, making it look like he's singing the soprano solo.
S: INT. BASEMENT SET AS "THE PROM" - DAY
N: Coop and Ashley have brought some help: Plantain and the Bouncer. They're waiting around for the guys. The room is their most elaborate set so far, a hotel ball room, complete with themed prom banner, dance floor, stage, etc.
C: COOP
D: No, no, it's a municipal bond fund.
C: ASHLEY
D: But what about the capital gains?
C: COOP
D: Sure there's short term capital gains, but the dividends are tax free.
C: PLANTAIN
D: State and federal? Deacon enters with Matt and Fred.
C: ASHLEY
D: Hey, guys. I hope you don't mind, Plantain and Baxter want to be in the movie, too.
C: BOUNCER
D: Hey! Mr. Runningbear! Matt smiles meekly as we CUT TO:
C: THE PRODUCTION MONTAGE:
D: 95A INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95A Moments later, cheesy prom MUSIC plays and a mirrored disco ball reflects light across the dance floor. As the couple dances across the floor, dressed in a prom gown and tux, Ashley looks into Coop's eyes.
C: ASHLEY
D: Ira, I have something important to tell you.
C: COOP
D: What is it?
C: ASHLEY
D: This prom is making me so hot. I'm ready to lose my virginity to you tonight.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 95. Coop gives the thumbs up to the Bouncer, also dressed in a tux, then starts making out with Ashley in an exaggerated tongue-lapping display. BEHIND THE CAMERA, Matt peeks out and looks at the other two guys with a furled brow. Deacon gives him a forced thumbs up.
S: 95B INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95B
N: Coop and Ashley sit in the back seat of a Split Car. Coop says, "Oh, Rachael. You're the best." Fred looks over at Deacon, who just smiles sheepishly.
S: 95C INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95C
N: The Bouncer and Coop play chess as the guys capture the offscreen action. Ashley says, "You're the sexiest teacher I ever had." The guys turn their heads sideways to figure out the bizarre position Ashley and Plantain have gotten themselves into.
S: 95D INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95D
N: Plantain, dressed as a chaperone with a big punch stain on her dress, is eating a tuna fish sandwich and smoking a cigarette. Matt calls "Okay, people. Places. Let's get it together." Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel, hides the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with Weylon J. Petunia's.
C: PLANTAIN
D: My dress is ruined!
C: BOUNCER
D: I'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen. What are we going to do? She rips off her dress in one big swoop, revealing sexy underwear. 95E INT. BASEMENT BATHROOM - DAY 95E Fred is in the bathroom with the Moisty-Mate, but he just can't seem to get in the mood. Through the door:
C: PLANTAIN
D: I never knew chaperoning the prom could be so "hard." Fred gives up and throws the lotion back in his book bag. When he exits the bathroom, everyone is staring in his direction, then quickly looks away nonchalantly. 95F INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95F The Bouncer is going at it with an ugly sex face, dripping with sweat.
E: O.S.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 96. Fred lowers the boom and it smacks the Bouncer in the head. Deacon applauds, trying to rally the troops, "Good scene. Good scene."
S: 96G INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 96G
N: Plantain speaks with no real enthusiasm, "I give you an A+." Matt asks her to do the line again, but she says it exactly the same way again. One more time, same result. Suddenly Coop lets out a huge FART and everyone starts laughing. Matt throws his hands up, frustrated.
S: 95H INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY 95H
N: Coop and Ashley are in the back seat, post coitus.
C: ASHLEY
D: That was the best prom ever.
C: COOP
D: You can say that again. And as Ashley actually repeats her line, we see Fred mouthing it along with her, proud of his contribution to the script. 95J EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 95J Matt strips off the sheets, sprays them with lighter fluid, and sets them on fire. As the flames rise up and FILL THE

D: Rachael?
C: RACHAEL
D: Hi, how are you?

N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 97. Deacon looks her over.
C: DEACON
D: So, how's John Baldwin? Rachael goes white.
C: RACHAEL
D: Who told you about that?
C: DEACON
D: Everybody knows.
C: RACHAEL
D: Well everybody is a liar. I never did it with John Baldwin. Deacon is stunned.
C: DEACON
D: You didn't?
C: RACHAEL
D: Jesus, Deacon. I don't even know him. It's not like it was with us. It hits Deacon like a ton of bricks. INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY Deacon and Fred enter and see Matt sitting by the computer.
C: FRED
D: So...?
C: DEACON
D: How does it look?
C: MATT
D: It looks great. It's the best porno film I've ever made.
C: FRED
D: So what's the problem?
C: DEACON
D: Are you done with it?
C: MATT
D: Well, I cut together some footage to give to Ashley for her reel, but I don't think I can finish this film.
C: FRED
D: Why not?
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 98.
C: MATT
D: I can't even watch it. Every time I turn it on, I keep thinking about that tuna fish sandwich and Coop farting all day long.
C: DEACON
D: That was pretty gross.
C: MATT
D: That's just it. The movie looks great, but seeing everything else -- all the disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's taken all the fun out of it. And I just don't want to do it any more.
C: FRED
D: Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn't handle this. Matt looks away.
C: DEACON
D: Take it easy, Fred.
C: FRED
D: No, I knew that when it came down to it, Matt would wuss out. Matt snaps.
C: MATT
D: You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You're the wuss here. At least I don't have to whack off every time I see a girl in the hallway. Fred shoves Matt.
C: FRED
D: Shut up, Matt. Matt stands up and gets in Fred's face.
C: MATT
D: No, you shut up! For once in your life, be a man and admit this movie was a mistake.
C: FRED
D: Why don't you make me? The two square off, staring each other down. Until,
C: DEACON
D: No. Matt's right. This movie was a mistake.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 99.
C: FRED
D: What are you talking about? This whole thing was your idea.
C: DEACON
D: Come on, Fred. Didn't you think this movie was going to be ... I don't know, sexy? Fred looks at the other two for a beat, not sure what to say. Finally, he smiles.
C: FRED
D: How long have you guys known about the bathroom thing? Deacon laughs.
C: MATT
D: If you didn't like making the movie, why didn't you say something?
C: FRED
D: I don't know. I thought you guys were having fun. I didn't want to be the wuss. A beat.
C: FRED
D: So what about the car?
E: CONT'D
C: DEACON
D: The Aerostar's not so bad.
C: FRED
D: What about the money and the power and the women? What about Tony Montana?
C: MATT
D: Scar Face is just a stupid movie, Fred. Fred smiles.
C: MATT
D: So what do we do with this? He holds up the tape. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT The tape is burning in the center of a huge bonfire. A massive party is raging. Tons of teenagers are dancing, drinking, and having a good time rocking to a LIVE BAND. At the center of it all are Matt, Fred, and Deacon are finally enjoying themselves.

C: FRED
D: Hey, Ashley. Can I ask you a question?
C: ASHLEY
D: Sure.
C: FRED
D: Do you think me and Matt will ever get girlfriends?
C: ASHLEY
D: Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have it made. You're smart, funny, fun to be with. In a couple of years, girls will be dying to meet men like you.
C: MATT
D: Really?
C: ASHLEY
D: Well, no. Popular, good looking guys always get the girls. Hey, what was I supposed to say? Then, Roger wheels by, arm in arm with his Hairdresser. No more braces and headgear, Roger looks sharp with slicked back hair and suave clothes.

C: COOP
D: Hey, you're not on the list, dude.
C: J.T.
D: What's with you, you pussy? Are you joining the retard team, too? Just then, Plantain enters and walks to the front of the line. The high school guys stop everything to stare at her.
C: PLANTAIN
D: Coop!
C: COOP
D: Plantain. Plantain kisses him, while nonchalantly grabbing his crotch.
C: PLANTAIN
D: Come on. You don't need to wait in this line. Deacon and the guys are already inside. Coop puts his arms around her and walks away, not without looking back over his shoulder for a second at J.T. standing there, dumbfounded. Then, the Bouncer escorts J.T. away. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT Ashley is walking by Wendy and Kelly.

C: KELLY
D: And you are...?
C: ASHLEY
D: Ashley. Deacon's ex.

C: WENDY
D: No.
C: KELLY
D: I think so. No.
E: off Ashley's look
C: ASHLEY
D: Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week?
C: KELLY AND WENDY
D: No.
C: ASHLEY
D: You're wasting your time giving those Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll probably wind up unemployed wife beaters anyway.
C: KELLY
D: So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody?
C: ASHLEY
D: Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if you're interested, you better move fast. Those guys know how to do this thing ... She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly. They look shocked. Ashley walks off... 100A EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT 100A ...and finds Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride. She sits down next to him.

C: DEACON
D: Yeah. She was.
C: ASHLEY
D: You're gonna dump her.
C: DEACON
D: I don't want to. I don't know. It's not like it was when I was with Rachael. Rachael and I used to talk about stuff. We just, I don't know, connected.
C: ASHLEY
D: Very good, Deacon. Deacon is confused.
C: DEACON
D: What do you mean?
C: ASHLEY
D: Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that you finally figured it out. A moment of realization.
C: DEACON
D: Yeah, I guess I did. So I have to do this, don't I?
E: beat
C: ASHLEY
D: I guess. Or not. Whatever. Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon. EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk.
E: joking this time
C: DEACON
D: There's something I want to talk to you about.
C: NAOMI
D: What?

N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 104.
C: NAOMI
D: What?
C: DEACON
D: Well, I mean, we don't really have anything in common. And we don't really even get along.

D: You're breaking up with me? Can we still have sex?
E: beat
C: DEACON
D: Listen to what I'm saying, Naomi.
C: NAOMI
D: The only reason I went out with you was because I thought you were a nice guy. And now you're breaking up with me?
C: DEACON
D: Yeah. I guess so.
C: NAOMI
D: If you tell anybody about this... I have a reputation.
C: DEACON
D: I won't. You can tell people you dumped me if you want.
C: NAOMI
D: Really?
C: DEACON
D: Sure. What do I care?

C: JAKE
D: Oh, really, skidmarks? I know someone who will believe me. Your parents.
C: DEACON
D: The web site is in someone else's name. All our records are encrypted. There's no tracing it to us, jerk off.
C: JAKE
D: Oh, really? Well, good thing I took the tape of Ashley masturbating in your basement. When they see that, they'll see what kind of movies their perfect little Deacon is making.
C: DEACON
D: Did you make a copy of it?
C: JAKE
D: No.
C: DEACON
D: You sent the original tape to my parents?
C: JAKE
D: Yup.
C: NAOMI
D: You know, Jake, you're a real dick! She punches him in the stomach. He doubles over and she uppercuts him. He flies backwards, crashing through a table.
C: DEACON
D: Jesus.
C: MATT
D: You should probably avoid pissing her off.

C: MATT
D: The key is to try and remember what it was like before you had sex. What did you used to fantasize about? A math teacher who bends over a little too far. The door to the girls' locker room open just a sliver. Going over to visit your friend and catching his mother coming out of the shower.

C: DEACON

C: MRS. LEWIS

C: MR. LEWIS
D: Explain? Explain?
C: DEACON
D: If you'll just give me a chance...
C: MR. LEWIS
D: How are you going to explain this? He holds up the REPORT CARD.
C: MRS. LEWIS

E: CONT'D
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 112.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Let alone two--
C: DEACON
D: Is that what this is about? My biology class? It's just a stupid midterm grade.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: I don't like your tone, mister.
C: DEACON
D: Mom, Dad. I'm seventeen now. I'm driving. I've got a girlfriend. Well, actually, we broke up. But you guys treat me like a kid. Is it too much to ask for to be a normal teenager with a normal life?
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: You broke up with Ashley?
C: DEACON
D: No. Naomi. Look. I just want to have fun with my friends, okay? They look him over. Finally,
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Okay, then. Just make sure you don't repeat this performance on your finals.

N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 113. Max hands him the tape and they shake hands. Deacon turns to Matt and Fred waiting in the foyer. They're relieved.
T: CUT TO:
C: FRED'S FACE FRED
D: I'm really nervous. DEACON puts his arm around his shoulders.
C: DEACON
D: My advice is to go slow. If you feel you're losing control, just try to relax. Don't worry. It's easier than it looks. PULL BACK to reveal we're in INT. DMV - DAY Fred is about to take his driving test.
C: FLASH!
D: Fred gets his picture taken. EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - DAY Deacon drives the minivan home and pulls in next to the brand new convertible sports car. Deacon gets out, excited.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: What do you think?
C: DEACON
D: This is for me?
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Are you crazy? It's for me. You want a new car, you get an after school job. Deacon's Mom is wearing a sexy outfit and carries an overnight bag. She's beaming.
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: But we are letting you have the Aerostar. It may not be "cool," but it'll get you where you're going.
C: DEACON
D: Thanks, guys. Really.

S: EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

C: MATT
D: It's not even in focus. This is really shoddy work. Deacon takes it back from him.
C: MATT
D: So, guys. I decided I'm going to apply to NYU next year. The film school.
E: CONT'D
C: FRED
D: Too bad we burned the film. You could have submitted it as your sample.
C: MATT
D: Good idea, Balls. The guys start laughing.
C: FRED
D: So, I guess we all got what we deserved. No money, no power, no women.
C: MATT
D: Tony Montana would be pissed. Just then, Rachael spots them and walks over.
C: DEACON
D: Speak for yourself, guys.
C: RACHAEL
D: Hey, guys. Deacon. Deacon KISSES her. The other two guys are stunned. INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY Deacon walks down the hallway with Matt and Fred, and holding Rachael's hand. The four of them run into Wendy and Kelly.
C: WENDY
D: Hey, guys. Hey, Deacon. I heard Naomi broke up with you.
C: DEACON
D: Yeah. But I think it worked out better this way.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 115. Rachael smiles.
C: WENDY
D: Hey, Fred. I hear you know a thing or two about giving women pleasure. Fred freezes. He steels himself, trying to build up the nerve to say what he wants to say. Then,
C: FRED
D: No, I don't. She's disappointed. The whole gang hangs their heads. Then,
C: FRED
D: Matt knows a thing or two about pleasuring women. I know everything. Fred smiles ear to ear. Wendy laughs, duly impressed.
E: CONT'D
C: WENDY
D: We should go out some time. Kelly looks at Matt seductively.
C: KELLY
D: Maybe all four of us could go out.
C: MATT
D: That could work, you know, depending on my schedule.
C: WENDY
D: Cool. So call me. They walk off just as Jake pushes Deacon from behind.
C: JAKE
D: Watch where you're going, sphincter boy. But he's dealing with a totally new and improved Deacon now.
C: DEACON
D: I thought I told you not to call me that anymore.
C: JAKE
D: What are you going to do about it?
C: DEACON
D: Some people never learn. Matt pulls out a funky remote control. He hits a button and all the monitors come on up and down the hallway. Students stop to look up at them.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 116. 121A ON THE MONITORS 121A plays a specially edited version of the infamous first attempt at making the porno, aptly titled, "William H. Wall High School Presents: The Premature E-Jake-ulator."
C: JAKE
D: I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor?
C: 121B HALLWAY 121B
D: Jake is horrified.
C: JAKE
D: Stop it! Stop the video!
C: MATT
D: You probably shouldn't have mailed that tape back to us. The video starts repeating in continuous loop, but has been edited to sound like a rap song.
C: JAKE
D: Tiny pee-pee. Tiny pee-pee. E-jac-u-la- tor. E-jac, e-jac, e-jac-u-laaaaaaa-tor. Students point and laugh at him, while Deacon and the guys continue on down the hallway, dancing to the beat. Deacon kisses Rachael goodbye.
E: O.S.
C: DEACON
D: You know, guys, I've been thinking about something.
C: FRED
D: What's that?
C: DEACON
D: About how making the movie didn't turn out to be so fun. I think I figured out why. They stop at their lockers.
C: DEACON
D: Sex is like a comic book, still in the original wrapper. Once you open it up and read it, it loses its value.
E: CONT'D
C: FRED
D: Deep.
N: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 117.
C: MATT
D: I think he's got something there. Making that movie felt like we were tampering with forces we couldn't possibly understand.
C: DEACON
D: Exactly. The fun part about high school is unravelling the mystery of what's going to happen next. The guys smile and dial the combinations on their lockers. In the background, Jake is still on the ground crying. We TRACK through the hallway, outside... 121C EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 121C ... where we see a large CAR TRANSPORT, with three hot new sports cars on it. Their license plates read "JOHNNY H," "SAM SLAM," and "BALLS." TRACK OVER to Mike, unloading the cars and Vic, standing there smiling. FADE OUT:
C: END CREDITS
D: FADE IN: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Deacon's parents are in bed. On the TV plays familiar sounding porno music on the hotel pay-per-view.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Why do they always have to show the guy's face?
C: MRS. LEWIS
D: To make you think you can get girls as hot as her. It's a basic rule of porno. A long beat.
C: MR. LEWIS
D: Hey. Isn't that our basement? FADE OUT:
N: THE END
