N: "I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder if this sort of car starts easily?" Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found that he had hold of the handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him...

T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT
N: The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal. The vast Port of Los Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars except - A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then SOMEONE approaches... Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ... He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
T: that refuses to fade ...
N: This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern California ... Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ... Admiring it ... Adoring it ... But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver - ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: You gonna steal her or kneel down to her and pray -- ?
N: Memphis looks at him, still enthralled... ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ... Just take her, slick. - - And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ... No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the door ... Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small socket-like device - is pressed into the ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds. He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials. And Memphis floors it... And off they tear... The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones, fixed and fumy ... He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ... On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort... Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere -- A POLICE CAR appears behind them... And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their respective vehicles... The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.
C: DONNY
D: Problem, Officer?
C: POLICEMAN
D: Yes. You're under arrest -- ?
C: DONNY
D: For running a stop sign?
C: POLICEMAN
D: For Grand Theft Auto -
N: And off of Donny's look -- We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding toward him, sirens wailing... QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music ... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ... Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy pursuit ... And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson, heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of cruisers himself ... Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ... Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ... And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake -- And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ... And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower Grand... Looking down ... He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER, the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ... Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.
S: EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER
N: Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility fool you - the man's a street viper ... Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..
C: HAWKINGS
D: Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of Raines...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Well, then it's all for naught, ain't it, Hawkings?
N: Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up... Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood... Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks toward it, hand on hip...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I know you --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You know my back -
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: You want to come along quiet?
C: MEMPHIS
D: How's Atley -- ?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Let them go --
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: How's that?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Let them go. And I'll leave ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: You'll leave -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I don't golf...
N: And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers. DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) I do this. And I see you again. I'll come after you with everything I got. you won't be able to steal a glance at a blind man without me by your side ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You have my word...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Get out of here, then. Now.
N: And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Leave the car, Randall ...
N: Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower Grand ... Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Arright, let lim go. Cite him for rolling the stop ... And cite old Atley for driving to endanger ...
C: HAWKINGS
D: What are you talking about, Rollie? We're springing 'em? Just like that?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Just like that. Quit your bellyaching, Hawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...
N: And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to crescendo and we
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. INDEPENDENCE, CALIFORNIA - DAY - 6 YEARS LATER
N: Some 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one horse town, and the horse has died... Single stop light, single-engine firehouse, single everything. Norman Rockwell would find this burg a snooze.. - We settle on a small, GARAGE ... The peeling sign reads: "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE" owned and operated by Memphis Raines ... In blue coveralls, Memphis has a Plymouth Duster up on the lift ... With him is a kid - TOM, 19... Lightnin' Hopkins' "Automobile Blues" plays through --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You know what you got here?
C: TOM
D: Not really -
C: MEMPHIS
D: There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
C: TOM
D: Not really --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You have any other answers besides "not really"?
C: TOM
D: Not --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
N: Tom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To where an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking an unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the 200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...
C: BUDGY
D: Just can't find good help these days --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Those things'll kill ya, Budgy --
E: re: cigarette
C: BUDGY
D: They won't have a chance. The bourbon and bacon'll get me first...
N: Budgy cackles ... Memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet ... Budgy points at a passing car ... BUDGY (cont'd) That one -
C: MEMPHIS
D: 1980 Mercury Cougar. 255 cubic inch V8 ... Based on the Ford Thunderbird bodyshell; they modified the chassis, but didn't improve its performance...
N: Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play this game every day... MEMPHIS (cont'd) The 1970 Plymouth Road Runner. Proof positive of a single all-powerful Deity. The first bargain-priced muscle car ever. They even tuned the horn to resemble the "beep beep" sound of the cartoon Road Runner ... And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...
C: BUDGY
D: Damn, you're good
N: Memphis nods ... Sips his root beer ... BUDGY (cont'd) You got to bingo last night? Memphis looks at him ... Can't believe it himself ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: That I did, Budgy. That I did --
N: And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -
C: TOM
D: Uh ... Randall -- ?
E: O.S.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Excuse me --
N: Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RANCHO PALOS VERDES - BUSINESS DISTRICT
N: A FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored shades ... In the passenger seat is KIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop. Fancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ...
C: FREB
D: The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
C: KIP
D: He didn't mess up. There it is ...
N: And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And- there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night showroom lights... Freb and Mirror Man are startled
C: FREB
D: That -- ?
C: MIRROR MAN
D: You're shittin', right? Kip?
N: He grins at them... He ain't shittin'...
C: FREB
D: How are we supposed to--
C: KIP
D: Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
N: Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook --
C: MIRROR MAN
D: What tool -- ?
N: Kip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's carrying A BRICK -- MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Oh, no -- And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"... Calm and cool ... Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS raining down ... ALARMS SQUEAL As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb and Mirror Man can't believe it --
S: INT. EXOTIC MOTORS
N: Kip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip, unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the mechanism... The alarm raging in here... In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the showroom...
S: EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT
N: The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ...
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a stolen car
N: Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --
C: KIP
D: Yeah. Ain't it great -- ?
N: And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !
T: CUT TO:
N: A TENNIS BALL being bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT
N: A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the piss out of ATLEY JACKSON whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Can you stop that, for Chrissake?
C: TUMBLER
D: What's your problem, bro ?
N: Thunk! Thunk!
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Where are they -- ?
C: TUMBLER
D: They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins ... What happened -- ?
N: And Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ... TUMBLER (cont'd) Relax and enjoy --
S: EXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS
N: Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are implied... Mirror Man panics ...
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car, stolen car ...
C: KIP
D: Stolen fast car...
N: And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ... KIP (cont'd) It's calibrated for 140 ... Let's see if these British boys are full of shit or not --
C: MIRROR MAN
D: No way, man --
N: Yes, way. Kip floors it. They bury the Camaro in its wake... The gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... Mirror Man is having an embolism... They warp-speed by a POLICE CRUISER... Both kids totally unaware of the POLICE CHOPPER up on high... With them in its sights ... And they drive ... At last, ending up at -- THE WATERFRONT - A dark latticework of docks and wharves, warehouses and shipping crates... The freighters are somehow graceful against the moonlit water ...
S: INT. WAREHOUSE
N: Tumbler studies his watch... Now he's a little concerned ... He looks up ... Atley is glaring at him...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Something wrong, Tumbler -- ?
C: TUMBLER
D: Yeah. I'm missing Springer --
N: And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse... Tumbler flashes Atley a "told-you-so" smile... Kip and Mirror Man get out of the car... Kip walks over to a CLIPBOARD with a magic marker tethered to it ... It is a list of cars ... He draws a black line through "13) 1996 Lotus Esprit V8"... The others are clocking the car...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --
C: MIRROR MAN
D: I can vouch for that.
N: Tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... The vibe is celebratory...
C: TUMBLER
D: Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
C: KIP
D: No problem -
N: Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the thuggish man gets to his feet ...
C: THUGGISH MAN
D: Let's get outta here -- !
N: And they do... Heading out the back ... It's tough for Atley with his limp ... On the way out:
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Now you gone and done it, Raines And they flee ...
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
N: A HALF-DOZEN POLICE CARS. The CHOPPER does the usual spotlight-trailing... It's turned into a total pig circus ... A car pulls to a stop ... And out steps Detective Roland Castlebeck, whom we remember from our opening...
S: INT. WAREHOUSE
N: Castlebeck surmises the take ... The cars ... His partner DETECTIVE DRYCOFF - a sneering Irish boy with zero patience - comes out from the back ...
C: DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
D: They're gone...
N: Castlebeck nods ... Looks at the cars ...
S: INT. "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE" - INDEPENDENCE - DUSK
N: Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. When a brand new purple MERCEDES SLK, windows tinted, pulls in out front. It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence. Memphis senses danger. He goes out. Budgy and his dog are here... Budgy looks spooked... Tom, too ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What's going on -- ?
N: And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of place here as a maggot on a muffin...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Well, well, well ...
N: And he begins to sing... ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) (ANDY GRIFFITH theme) Da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc. (laughs) Are you kidding me, man -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Hello, Atley ...
N: ATLEY JACKSON (re: sign) L.N. ORR. I get it. Clever ... Memphis studies him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: How's the leg?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
N: He laughs some more ... Chain-lights his cig ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What are you doing here?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Is there someplace we can talk?
N: Memphis looks at him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What about?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
S: INT. TEDDY'S TAVERN - NIGHT
N: A BARMAID sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...
C: WAITRESS
D: There you go --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Thanks, Donna --
N: She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: It's been a long time, Memphis --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Six years ...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Tell me about Kip -
N: Atley takes a sip of his beer,...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What kind of job... ?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: A boost. A big boost ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
N: Atley frowns ... Looks at him...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: You're shittin', right?
N: Clearly Memphis is not ... ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left. He's been working a low-rent ring for two years now. You don't talk to your Ma?
C: MEMPHIS
D: It seems she neglected to mention it
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
C: MEMPHIS
D: Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
N: Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then:
C: MEMPHIS
D: Who was the job for?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Who do you think?
N: Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ... ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter" Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ... Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face speaks volumes ... ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I just thought you should know, man. I kind of had a feeling you didn't. But I should tell you: I'm working for him now - The Carpenter - so if you see him, you won't mention me coming to get you... Like I said: I just thought ... I owed you ... And that it was the right thing to do ... Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK, As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO: THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK...

N: And she goes to the coffee station... When
C: MEMPHIS
D: Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint -- ?
E: O.S.
N: And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression displays many things ... Most of them joy ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Hello, Ma -- And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes tight ... HELEN RAINES (cont'd) Oh, Randall ... She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook smiles from behind the order wheel ...

S: INT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - POOL HALL - NIGHT
N: A dozen tables... Smells of blue chalk and whiskey... The juke box cranked... We take it to the back of the joint ... Where Kip, and Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack... Freb sits nearby, with a few badly made-up GIRLS...
C: TUMBLER
D: ... so ... It's my new move ... It's called "The Stranger." What I do is, I sit on my hand for 10 minutes. Till it falls asleep. Till it's good and numb. No feeling. And then I jerk off.

C: KIP
D: It can be done, man. We just gotta step it up... It's a challenge ...

D: I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius: Memphis come back to save our bacon!
C: TUMBLER
D: Shut-up, Mirror Man --
C: FREB
D: Izzat true? You come back to save our bacon?
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Of course it's true. He come to save his brother's dangling ass --
C: KIP
D: That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
C: FREB
D: We don't -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: He give you an advance -- ?
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
N: Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You just give 'im back the money. All's well...
N: The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...
C: KIP
D: "Give lim back the money." "Give 'im back the money..." Be nice. If only we didn't drink the money. And smoke the money. And buy Nikes with the money. And Sony Play Stations with the money. And dirty girls with the money...
N: And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...
C: KIP
D: But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
C: TUMBLER
D: Things are all leafy and suburban ...
C: MIRROR MAN
D: The hell they are --
C: KIP
D: Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled... And it was nice to see you -- -
N: Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet and in close, nose to nose ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake. But I remember the days when you used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em... So you can't stop me from saving your "dangling ass' if that's what I feel like doing...
N: And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them, the crowd parting like a wound... Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...
C: TUMBLER
D: Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ...
N: And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO:
S: EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT
N: A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung buildings ...
S: EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT
N: A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is FLATTENED, for easy shelving ... Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE: Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the garage. A young Mexican KID driving. A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!"
S: INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP
N: A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels, interiors, air bags ...
S: EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE
N: Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ...
C: DOG-FACE
D: Yeah -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ...
S: INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL
N: Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him into another room. Which is A WORKSHOP An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the- art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes. An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked against the rear wall ... Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ... He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a cobra. The liegelord of downtown... And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's as SILENT-as a tomb... A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room. Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ...
T: Examines his fresh cut...
C: CALITRI
D: Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ... frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
E: looks at his clothes;
C: MEMPHIS
D: How ya doing?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Good to see you, Memphis --
C: CALITRI
D: So. What do we owe the honor -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: It's about my brother ... Kip...
C: CALITRI
D: Yes ... Kip ...
N: He says the name like other men say "cancer." The phone on his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...
C: CALITRI
D: Excuse me one moment, Randall ...
N: And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...
S: INT. GARAGE - THE MEXICAN MAN
N: is sobbing. As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the bloodied windshield.
C: CALITRI
D: You bring this to me in this condition? Blood and guts all over it? You make me complicit? On my property? Who taught you how to think? And worst of all: weren't there supposed to be two Hondas?
C: THIEF
D: Please ...
N: And Calitri, rapid-fire, PUNCTURES the man's belly and chest and legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... Until the man is on the floor, howling ...
C: CALITRI
D: Stupid sonuvabitch...
S: INT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP
N: Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at Atley...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Jesus ...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: The business has changed...
N: Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.
C: CALITRI
D: Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
C: MEMPHIS
D: I don't want him hurt...
N: Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...
C: CALITRI
D: I'm proud of this work. The bird feeder. The wagon wheel planter. The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable server...
N: He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then gestures to the yard... CALITRI (cont'd) Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood is warm. Clean. Provided by nature. To see a piece of furniture take shape. It's like watching a child grow ... Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I'm sure you're working your way to the point. I'll wait right here ...
N: Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...
C: CALITRI
D: My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best. Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
C: CALITRI
D: Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...
N: Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby. CALITRI (cont'd) No, no. You don't kill me, because you can't. You don't take your brother and run, because we'd find him. You don't go to the-police, because we have friends there, too. You do nothing: except deal with me. Memphis eyes him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
C: CALITRI
D: Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
N: Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside. CALITRI (cont'd) On that list, you'll find fifty cars. Fifty. Five-zero. They range in age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in expense from the 1993 Volkswagen Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero. Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ... CALITRI (cont'd) There is a container ship in Long Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be loaded with 4-car-per shipping containers, false-walled and customsprofiled as motor oil designated. The ship leaves in four days for South America and the men who've tendered me this contract ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: They gave you only four days?
C: CALITRI
D: They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
N: Memphis scans the list ... CALITRI (cont'd) Four days. 50 cars. I'm paying 200 thousand dollars ... Now Memphis looks up...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I'm not interested --
C: CALITRI
D: I knew you'd say that.
C: MEMPHIS
D: I'm just here about my brother.
C: CALITRI
D: I knew you'd say that, too --
N: Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing the trap ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Sound it out for me.
C: CALITRI
D: Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: And if he doesn't make it -- ?
N: Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...
C: CALITRI
D: I made this, too. My first one. Brass extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon. Expensive hardwood. And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe ...
N: Memphis waits, knowing where this is going -- CALITRI (cont'd) Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... Kip will take up permanent residence in this box ... Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s and dressed in dirty coveralls ... CALITRI (cont'd) Come here for a second, boys -- And they come over --
C: DIGGER
D: Evenin', Mr. C. --
C: CALITRI
D: Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to Randall Raines. Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal. Left us for parts unknown. Randall, this is Digger. And that's Butz -
C: DIGGER
D: Hi, Randall --
N: Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz, who go back to work...
C: CALITRI
D: Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial. They're good boys ...
N: Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:
C: MEMPHIS
D: I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
C: CALITRI
D: "don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
N: Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri turns to Memphis... CALITRI (cont'd) "Nothing that's forced can ever be right." Old woodworking expression. I really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship ... I just care that they do. You decide. With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.
S: EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
N: A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...
S: INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE
N: Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We see a CRIME SCENE ...
C: REPORTER
D: ... the car-jacking, which left Ramona Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of three, dead, occurred last night at ...
N: Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window ... At the SEDAN parked below...
S: EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street ... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I know you.
C: MEMPHIS
D: You know my back.
N: They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a spectacular bedspread of lights ...
C: DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
D: When'd you get to town, Raines?
C: MEMPHIS
D: The other day....
C: DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
D: What for?
C: MEMPHIS
D: No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
C: DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
D: Where you been, anyway?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
C: DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
D: You seem a little hinked-up ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Not at all ...
N: He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
C: MEMPHIS
D: A little family emergency --
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
C: MEMPHIS
D: No...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Or your baby brother. What was his name?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Kip.
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
N: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) I got a rash of thefts. A new crew is making noise. We recovered a big take - last week...
C: MEMPHIS
D: And this has what to do with me?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
N: Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
C: DETECTIVE DRYCOFF
D: By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
N: He laughs... And they drive off ... Memphis watching them go ... once they're gone... He walks ...
S: EXT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - BACK ALLEY EXIT - NIGHT
N: Kip comes out of the club... Toby follows ...
C: TOBY
D: You goin' home?
C: KIP
D: Yeah... You want a ride...
C: TOBY
D: Sure -
C: KIP
D: How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
C: TOBY
D: Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
C: KIP
D: You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
C: TOBY
D: I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
C: KIP
D: Damn crooks is everywhere --
N: They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM... TOBY (cont'd) Memphis seemed weird, huh? What's with them clothes? He a farmer now or something? And this seems funny to Kip... He smiles..
C: KIP
D: Yeah. Except the only thing he's growing is old...
N: And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the wall... KIP (cont'd) What do you want -- ? One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --
C: KIP
D: Don't you do that! You leave him alone!
C: GOON
D: Shaddup, Raines
C: KIP
D: He's got nothing to do with this --
N: And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.
C: GOON
D: Get him in the car
S: EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT
N: Kip comes to. In his car. Hot white lights blind him. The Trans Am is in the crusher. FIGURES above him. Calitri. The goons ...
C: CALITRI
D: Hello, Kip --
N: Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.
C: KIP
D: Lemme out of this --
C: CALITRI
D: Were it only that easy --
C: KIP
D: We can still do it --
N: Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit ... Kip is close to scrunch ...
C: CALITRI
D: No you can't. Flies on sherbert is what you remind me of. Because just being attracted to something, doesn't mean you belong...
S: INT. CALITRI'S WOODSHOP
N: Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's miserable. But there is nothing he can do.
S: EXT. SCRAPYARD - NIGHT
N: Kip continues to struggle free...
C: KIP
D: Listen, Calitri --
C: CALITRI
D: Call me "Ray." Better yet: call me "asshole." Cos that's how you've treated me --
C: KIP
D: I get out of this I'm gonna fuck you up --
N: Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch... KIP (cont'd) Calitri -- ! Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its origin ... Only he can't get the angle ... We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ... And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of
T: the harbor, we CUT TO:
S: INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - KITCHEN
N: Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ... And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times. When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal. Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ... Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Kip -- ?
C: KIP
D: Yeah ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You all right -- ?
C: KIP
D: I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
C: MEMPHIS
D: Just hold-on there --
N: Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head... MEMPHIS (cont'd) So you want to run that part by me again about things being "all sweetness and light..."
C: KIP
D: This has nothing to do with any of that --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
C: KIP
D: All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
N: Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage ... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house
S: INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
N: Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant, Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed Boston Celtic fast-break... Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks slightly ridiculous... Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the inevitable crack...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You okay -- ?
C: KIP
D: Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Sure --
N: And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --
C: KIP
D: you like Kobe's game? I do. You think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do. He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's got that going for him --
N: And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel ... Presses it to his head --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You sure you're okay -- ?
C: KIP
D: Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
N: Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip it...
C: KIP
D: Cool. So you're living up North?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Yeah -
C: KIP
D: I heard you were pumping gas -
C: MEMPHIS
D: Something like that -
C: KIP
D: You're kind of cultivating a new look.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Yeah --
N: Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel with another ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Maybe you need a stitch --
C: KIP
D: Nah. It's a scratch.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Okay --
N: Beat ...
C: KIP
D: Hey, you want something to eat ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: What do you got ... ?
N: And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the 'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...
C: KIP
D: Not much. I got olives. You like olives? Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes the Calabrese. It's more mellow
N: And he brings over a bowl of olives.
C: MEMPHIS
D: There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
C: KIP
D: Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
N: And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod... And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray... Then:
C: MEMPHIS
D: So what are you gonna do?
C: KIP
D: About what?
C: MEMPHIS
D: "About what?"
C: KIP
D: About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I can see that -
N: And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it. MEMPHIS (cont'd) You have everything ... under control?
C: KIP
D: Yeah. He just wants to know I'm still on it. He needs reassurance. All these big swinging dicks do. No worries. I won't let him get into our Kool-Aid...
N: Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ... KIP (cont'd) What -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: What happened to you?
C: KIP
D: What?
N: And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
C: KIP
D: C'mon, man... My "demise..." Overreaction
E: chuckles
C: MEMPHIS
D: "Over--" You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
C: KIP
D: Hey, now -
C: MEMPHIS
D: He's gonna kill you -- !
C: KIP
D: I can handle it --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You can handle it?
C: KIP
D: I can handle it --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You can handle it?
C: KIP
D: I can handle it --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You?
C: KIP
D: Me.
C: MEMPHIS
D: You?
C: KIP
D: Me...
N: Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then: KIP (cont'd) Why? You think you can help me? And he turns back to Kip ... KIP (cont'd) What can you do? You haven't done anything in six years but pump gas and go overall shopping. And the cars, they've changed ... There's new shit. Computer chip keys and sophisticated alarms and I don't think, an old guy, could much bypass 'em...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You don't think so, huh?
C: KIP
D: Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
N: And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:
S: EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - CANNERY / FISH AUCTION - DAY
N: A rack of eel and OCTOPUS hung out to dry in the salty sun ... Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial fishing hubbub: Portuguese FISHERMEN unloading albacore and bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek FISHERMEN emptying mackerel and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their WOMEN gut, clean and fillet ... As they walk, Atley is selecting FISH from the various MARINERS ... Who wrap it up for him... He places it in a leather satchel ... Everyone seems to know him...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Nicolo, how's the yellowtail today?
N: An old FISHERMAN, who speaks broken English, wraps up several steaks...
C: FISHERMAN
D: Very nice, Atley. Very nice ...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: You can't get it any fresher than this, Memphis ... From the sea to my skillet ... Nothing in between...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What's with the fish thing -- ?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Fish.
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: I do ... Christ, what happened to us ?
E: laughs
C: MEMPHIS
D: Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: No, but you dress like an asshole ...
N: They walk...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I think about that night a lot...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Me, too. Every time I walk...
C: MEMPHIS
D: How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
N: Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him. MEMPHIS (cont'd) Yeah, you know: I just. I just never really thanked-you. I meant to. I just want you to know... Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut filets. MEMPHIS (cont'd) Tell him it's on ... Atley looks at him...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Yeah -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
N: Atley nods...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Any idea how you're gonna go at it?
N: Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK. As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG

N: The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration operation ... Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes brazed... All under the watchful eye of... OTTO HALLIWELL Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the question: how the hell did they manage to rock together Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ? But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were and can be ... His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he is an artist ... His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ... Memphis wanders in... Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis ... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes him a few steps ... Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone through ...
C: OTTO
D: Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
E: holds him at arm's length
C: MEMPHIS
D: Hello, Otto ...
C: OTTO
D: You remember Junie?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Of course. Hi, Junie --
C: JUNIE
D: Hello, Memphis -
C: MEMPHIS
D: What happened here -- ?
C: OTTO
D: Whatever do you mean?
C: MEMPHIS
D: The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars? The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
C: OTTO
D: What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
N: He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ... OTTO (cont'd) It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ... (turns to Memphis) Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look splendid ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You, too, Otto
N: And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...
C: OTTO
D: I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: He's gotten involved --
N: Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie
C: OTTO
D: I can't concentrate. Play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise ...
E: O.S.
N: And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as if it were a Mahler symphony... OTTO (cont'd) The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear how they got the engine up? Hear those exhaust notes? That's a very wide rev range... Here, it peaks at 5500 RPM... Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat... OTTO (cont'd) Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much sorrow on these streets ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You think it can be done?
C: OTTO
D: Are you considering a comeback tour?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Tell me...
C: OTTO
D: It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
C: MEMPHIS
D: The hard part ...
C: OTTO
D: "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Is he still working here ?
C: OTTO
D: The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
C: MEMPHIS
D: I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
N: Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --
C: OTTO
D: I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: And the moral of that story is -- ?
C: OTTO
D: Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
N: And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ... OTTO (cont'd) ... 8.8:1 compression... We PRE-LAP Simon And Garfunkel's "Baby Driver" and CUT TO: CLOSE ON: A SIGN READING: "PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL" atop a moving DODGE ARIES K. Which is nearly SIDE-SWIPED by an oncoming PICK-UP. A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...
S: INT. DODGE - MOVING - CITY STREETS - DAY
N: A timid CHINESE GIRL - JENNY, 23 - negotiates the vehicle at 10 & 2. Riding shotgun, her howling instructor is DONNY ASTRICKY - 41, whom we remember from six years ago. Now he's paunchy, with Ernie Borgnine tough-guy-warmth. At one time, he kicked out the jams. Now he teaches driver's ed...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Pull over! Pull her the hell over!
N: Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch... DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Put it in PARK. Remember how to do that? It's the big "Pff. She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ... DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) "Objects May Appear Closer Than They Seem." Can you say that for me?
C: JENNY
D: I'm sorry.
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: You ain't sorry. You're a horrible driver... You can't strap into your seat belt, without almost getting creamed by a bus ...
N: She starts to cry... Donny softens ... DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Aw, c'mon. It's no big deal. You can't drive. You can't. Time to acknowledge it and move on. I can't swim. I know I can't. So you know what I do? I stay the fuck outta the pool ...
S: EXT. PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL - DAY
N: Memphis waits outside ... The Aries K comes crawling toward him. Donny gets out of the car ... Sees Memphis ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: How you doing, man?
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: You know where the others are?
N: Donny frowns... Looks close at Memphis ... Then:
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Most of 'em are gone. The Dyar Boys are doing a nickel at Chino; Henry Santoro and Frankie Fish are moving weight in Florida; Bill Doolin was killed in Denver... Atley Jackson's on the gimp and runnin' errands for Calitri; The Sphinx is still around, I guess ... Then of course, there's ...
N: His pause is meaningful ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Forget that ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
S: INT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT
N: In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis and Donny sit... With the list before them...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Most of 'em are late-model...
C: MEMPHIS
D: That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
N: Otto enters. Giggles...
C: OTTO
D: Some crew you got ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
C: OTTO
D: Dignity...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Yeah...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Well, the three of us don't'exactly inspire confidence...
N: Beat ... Donny examines the list ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: I know. Weird, huh -- ?
N: The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...
C: WORKER
D: Otto, there's someone here to --
N: But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Lookit Kip. All grown up...
C: KIP
D: Hey, Donny --
C: MEMPHIS
D: What are you doing here?
C: KIP
D: Otto called -
N: Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...
C: OTTO
D: You need him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: No we don't -
C: OTTO
D: I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
C: MEMPHIS
D: His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
C: OTTO
D: The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
N: Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
C: KIP
D: I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You hear me?
C: KIP
D: I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
N: Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: You guys have any skills at all?
C: KIP
D: Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: How old are you now, Toby?
C: TOBY
D: Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
N: Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: What about him?
E: re: Freb
C: KIP
D: Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
N: Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...
C: FREB
D: People gotta eat ...
N: Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Okay, then... Otto?
C: OTTO
D: In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
C: TUMBLER
D: One night? Are you nuts?
C: MEMPHIS
D: You got maybe a better plan?
N: Tumbler looks to Kip...
C: KIP
D: You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit
C: MEMPHIS
D: "Shadow games?"
C: KIP
D: Shadow games ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
N: Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Go on, Otto -
C: OTTO
D: We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: There's no one left ...
C: OTTO
D: We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
N: Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.
C: MIRROR MAN
D: You know of one -- ?
E: to Otto
C: MEMPHIS
D: Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
N: So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO:
S: INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT
N: A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES. Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint...
C: DRUNK
D: One more, girl -
N: The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She collects the Drunk's empty glass...
C: SWAY
D: I think you've had enough, Billy...
C: DRUNK
D: Enough? I haven't even started, girl. Gimme another --
C: SWAY
D: If you leave now, Billy, you can get a head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit...
C: DRUNK
D: Listen, you little cooze--
N: And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ... And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of "Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...
S: EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT
N: Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ...
C: SWAY
D: Come back when you've learned how to drink, Billy --
N: And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
C: SWAY
D: What are you doing here?
N: And she heads back inside ... And he follows her...
S: INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE"
N: They head toward the bar...
C: SWAY
D: What's with the look?
E: re: his clothes
C: MEMPHIS
D: The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
C: SWAY
D: You look like you lost your sheep ...
N: And she hops back behind the bar ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
C: SWAY
D: Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Buy you a drink?
C: SWAY
D: Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
N: She waves to a 30-year-old CAT drinking with his buddies. He waves back. Memphis frowns. SWAY (cont'd) Mitch.
C: MEMPHIS
D: "Mitch?"
C: SWAY
D: Mitch.
C: MEMPHIS
D: So I was replaced by Mitch?
C: SWAY
D: No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
N: She smiles sourly at him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Wow. And to think all I accomplished these past six years was the "LORD OF THE RINGS" trilogy...
N: She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her glassware ... Beat ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) You look great --
C: SWAY
D: Yeah, well, you always were a sucker for flawed existences ...
N: ANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ... SWAY (cont'd) You should leave --
C: MEMPHIS
D: On account of Mitch?
C: SWAY
D: On account of me.
N: He studies her... Then:
C: MEMPHIS
D: I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
C: SWAY
D: No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
C: MEMPHIS
D: I left town. I didn't leave you.
C: SWAY
D: A distinction worth noting ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: And here I am...
C: SWAY
D: Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
C: MEMPHIS
D: Kip's in trouble
N: And now she looks concerned
C: SWAY
D: What kind of trouble -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
C: SWAY
D: And you got some Italians -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Six or seven...
C: SWAY
D: I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I understand -
N: And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers
C: MITCH
D: Another round, Sara -
C: SWAY
D: Sure, Mitch -
N: And she goes to the tap ... Leaving Memphis and Mitch ...
C: MITCH
D: How you doing, pal?
N: Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway... MITCH (cont'd) She's hot, right?
C: MEMPHIS
D: I'd go so far as to say "lovely."
N: And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...
C: MITCH
D: You should her face when she's having sex --
N: And Memphis turns to him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Really?
C: MITCH
D: Really...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What's it look like?
N: And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING. Mitch's face curls ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted face? Agonized and writhing and ugly? Oh, now I see it, yes, yes! And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway comes over ...
C: SWAY
D: What the hell are you doing -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
N: And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.
C: MITCH
D: Who was that guy, Sara?
N: She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...
C: SWAY
D: Good question ...
S: INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT
N: Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ... Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:
C: TUMBLER
D: Freb's here. Open the gate.
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: We sent him out on a solo boost. See what he could do ...
E: to Otto
N: Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...
C: FREB
D: How do I look in this one?
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac.
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: How'd it go?
C: FREB
D: Keys were in it ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Well, that defies the point, don't it?
C: MIRROR MAN
D: You should ask him how he got the name "Freb."
C: FREB
D: Shaddup, man ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Get the damn thing in there and get it cleaned up -
N: Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.
C: KIP
D: This is loaded with crap - get a duffel.
N: He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ... Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ... MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Holy shit ... It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Lemme see that -
N: He pierces the skin.. Tastes ... DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Heroin.
C: KIP
D: No shit?
N: And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: There's gotta be a million bucks worth here -
C: TUMBLER
D: We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich!
C: MEMPHIS
D: Where'd you pick her up?
C: FREB
D: In front of one of them poker parlors in Chinatown ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Well, take it back --
C: KIP
D: Take it back? What do you mean take it back? Are you crazy, man?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Take it back, Freb --
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
N: Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ... Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin. MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Now, see what you-- But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.
C: OTTO
D: Who is it -- ?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Castlebeck.
E: O.S.
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
C: OTTO
D: one minute -- !
N: And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto. Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ... Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of the Caddy ... But there's no time... For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I know you.
C: MEMPHIS
D: You know my back.
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: What are you still doing here, Randall?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
N: Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around the garage... Taking it all in... Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: What's this -- ?
C: OTTO
D: Cadillac.
N: ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: What's wrong with it -- ?
C: OTTO
D: Needs brightening ...
N: Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Run me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.
N: He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...
C: OTTO
D: No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
N: Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...
C: RADIO
D: 329 HRO. There's no want on the license at this time...
E: O.S.
N: Castlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares at the Caddy, still unconvinced...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Something like that -
N: Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in ... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Let her rip ...
N: And Castlebeck starts the car... ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems satisfied ... Gets out.
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
C: OTTO
D: Double-meaning intended, right?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Right ...
N: Castlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I don't think so, Detective ...
N: And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping the heroin into the sink, running the tap ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Take her back to where you found her, Freb --
S: INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes home ... Hangs up his coat ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Hey -
N: He kisses her head ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Kip - Kip nods ... Plays on ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) What do you got there?
C: HELEN RAINES
D: The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What time of year?
C: HELEN RAINES
D: Tuesdays ...
N: He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen; Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father (ROBERT RAINES) a MAN with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass 442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost feel his strong, sure presence ... Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.
C: MEMPHIS
D: You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
C: HELEN RAINES
D: Every day. I wonder about that every day...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership... Imagine us selling cars?
E: to Kip
N: Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to his Mother ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Imagine that -- ?
C: HELEN RAINES
D: And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
E: salesman voice
C: MEMPHIS
D: Mother -- !
N: They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) I remember, every day, he'd come home in a different car. That was the greatest thing ... And we'd climb all over it ... Examine every inch of every different car ...
C: HELEN RAINES
D: I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You remember that, Kip?
C: KIP
D: I was six ...
N: Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:
C: MEMPHIS
D: After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here.
N: Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...
C: KIP
D: Ancient history's two things. "Ancient." And "history!"
N: And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis turns to his mother ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma.
C: HELEN RAINES
D: I know...
C: MEMPHIS
D: We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
N: And she nods ... ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.
S: EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY
N: The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the rows of parked cars ... Searching ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost. No skill. No finesse. Can only take the car if the key is in it. That's not thieving. That's parking ... Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ...
C: TOBY
D: They're just cars, man ...
N: To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in with:
C: MEMPHIS
D: This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
C: TOBY
D: Who's "Eleanor?"
C: MEMPHIS
D: The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
C: TOBY
D: Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
C: MEMPHIS
D: All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
C: MEMPHIS
D: And there she is --
N: Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with black top ... MEMPHIS (cont'd) Hello, Eleanor -- And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.
C: TOBY
D: It looks just like a regular Mustang --
C: KIP
D: Don't go there, Toby --
C: MEMPHIS
D: She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
C: TOBY
D: So she flies -
C: MEMPHIS
D: She soars -
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Grade-A unicorn ...
C: TOBY
D: What's a "unicorn?"
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Fabled creature. You know - the horse with the horn? Impossible to capture?
N: Toby looks blank ... DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) We all got one. The single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens... Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back. It's voodoo...
C: TOBY
D: You guys and the car thing, man --
N: They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby
C: MEMPHIS
D: See you in a few days, Eleanor --
S: INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY
N: To Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car." The crew is at work, a MAZDA and a CADDY are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim- jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with pointy leads ... - Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA.
C: MIRROR MAN
D: And you just stick it in the lock. Hit this little button ... And ...
N: He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ...
C: OTTO
D: We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ... Can I try -- ?
E: to Mirror Man
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Knock yourself out --
N: Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ...
C: TOBY
D: I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
C: MEMPHIS
D: So what's in there -- ?
C: TOBY
D: I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
N: Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...
C: KIP
D: Good work, Toby --
N: Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start it fail...
C: FREB
D: It just ain't happening --
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
C: FREB
D: What's that?
N: Donny smiles ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: On boost night? Always take along a good mix tape ...
N: Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ... DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) You bring a woman back to your crib for some lovemaking, the song you put on, depends on the woman, the type of lovemaking you intend to do, right?
C: FREB
D: I guess ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
C: FREB
D: okay ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
C: FREB
D: Got it ...
E: absolutely hasn't got it
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Good.
N: And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ... DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Memphis went out and got some big game ... Hello, Sway. I was just telling the lads about mix tapes --

N: They embrace. Memphis and Kip enter from the other room...
C: KIP
D: How ya doing, Sway -- ?
C: SWAY
D: Kip...
N: She looks at Memphis ... Small nod... Small smile ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: What do you think about all this?
C: SWAY
D: Stick it in the drawer marked "Fool's Errand", right -- ?
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: That's my girl --
C: MEMPHIS
D: That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
C: SWAY
D: Hey -
N: But the kids look high near thunderstruck ... The others laugh ... Go back to their work ... Memphis and Sway SWAY (cont'd) No questions. I'm here. I need the dough.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Of course ...
N: She studies him... Nods ...
C: SWAY
D: Good. Just so we understand...
N: And then she sees something at the entrance ... SWAY (cont'd) Oh, shit. You didn't -- He follows her gaze ... To where -- A MAN, early 40s, has walked in. Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. This man never speaks. And his nose is a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... Which is why they call him THE SPHINX And the others really don't dig his scene ...
C: DONNY ASTRICKY
D: Well, well, well. The original crash test dummy...
N: The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy. Freb whispers to Otto ...
C: FREB
D: Who's that -- ?
C: OTTO
D: That's The Sphinx.
C: FREB
D: The Sphinx?
C: OTTO
D: He never says a word. And he's got a messed-up nose. Hence. The Sphinx. He's boo-koo koo-koo. But he steals like time ... Hello, Sphinxy, old rum -- !
E: to The Sphinx
N: And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --

Tumbler drives the 3rd van: Otto and Toby with him. They carry pens and NOTEBOOKS ... And, as they drive around, they're searching out cars ...

N: Otto shows Freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a tail-light with a wire to a mini-battery... This dead-shorts the lights, shorts-out the alarm system, which chirps for a sustained second and then kills itself. The door locks pop open ... Otto grins...

E: O.S.
N: INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM... Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall ... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster
C: SWAY
D: She's got 27 miles on her o-dom. Which is exactly how far away the custom shop was in 1979 when he bought her... He drove her home, never drove her again ...
E: O.S.

C: SWAY
D: We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Very good...
C: SWAY
D: Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
C: MEMPHIS
D: No way ...
C: SWAY
D: No ... ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: No ...
N: And he holds out a hand to her ... And she puts her greasesmeared towel into it ...
C: SWAY
D: Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
C: MEMPHIS
D: Oh. Okay. Right.
S: EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

D: What do you want from me?
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
N: And with that, he starts his car ... Drives off... Memphis gazing after him...
S: INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT
N: Memphis drives. Kip beside him. They drive in silence. At last coming to:
S: EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES
N: A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the chain-fence out front. And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: This one ...
N: He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing. Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds a little DEVICE. MEMPHIS (cont'd) What's that thing -- ?
C: KIP
D: Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
C: KIP
D: After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Thank-you ...
C: KIP
D: De nada ...
N: He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
C: KIP
D: The family that steals together, deals together...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Dad'd be proud --
C: KIP
D: Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What era was that -- ?
C: KIP
D: The era when crime didn't pay --
C: MEMPHIS
D: As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
C: KIP
D: Price of doing business...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
C: KIP
D: It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis. You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
N: And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go
S: INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT
N: The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis and the crew ... All but Sway are present. Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ... To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: We've got to shake them tomorrow night. I'm making that your problem. That's called delegation of duties. You like it -- ?
N: Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Sure, man --
N: And they follow him back into the garage ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each team has been assigned their ladies. The teams are: me and Sway. Donny and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror Man, you and The Sphinx ...
N: Mirror Man looks horrified ...
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Aw, c'mon, man ...
N: The Sphinx grins at him...
C: TOBY
D: What about me?
C: MEMPHIS
D: You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
C: TOBY
D: How come ... ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
C: TOBY
D: Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
C: KIP
D: There's no talkin' to him --
N: And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some paper cups ...
C: OTTO
D: To a safe and successful session of bumping fenders and trading paint.
E: cup raised
N: Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS. ("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...") And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto parts ...
C: BEACH BOYS
D: "Well, I'm not braggin,' babe So don't put me down But I got the fastest set of wheels in town, etc."
N: Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters. Only Kip stands aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing for a bit ... And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there. Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The Sphinx nod to Atley ...
C: CALITRI
D: This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
C: CALITRI
D: Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
C: OTTO
D: So saith the God of Scumbags --
C: CALITRI
D: Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered. And there's only one more night ...
C: OTTO
D: Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I wonder, if delivery isn't made?
N: Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...
C: CALITRI
D: With all the free time I've had not counting cars as they're loaded onto my ship, I've managed to sand the cedar inside your box, Kip. This will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment. Thus prolonging decay ...
N: He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be held back by Tumbler and Donny ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Get out of here, Ray --
C: CALITRI
D: One more night --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Get out --
C: CALITRI
D: I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
N: And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK... As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE
S: INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
N: As Memphis goes through some old boxes. At last, he finds what he's looking for ... Opens it ... He takes out its contents ... His tools, which we remember from the opening ... And then... CLOTHING ...

N: Drycoff and Hawkings wait in their unmarked ...
C: DRYCOFF
D: Oh, this is a good time --
N: He lights another cigarette ... The ashtray is overflowing.
C: HAWKINGS

D: It's a crime, ain't it? Cos Castlebeck's got a bug up his ass over this guy, I gotta get lung cancer ...
S: INT. OTTO'S
N: Mirror Man and Tumbler are at the window Memphis brought them to last night ... Mirror Man has a RADIO TRANSMITTER in his hand... Donny comes by ...
C: DONNY
D: What are you doing?
C: TUMBLER
D: Watch and learn, old-timer --
N: As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window ... A TOY CAR - a 1970 HEMI 'CUDA replica ... Radio-operated, the car speeds along the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks...
C: DONNY
D: The hell are you doing?
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style.
N: ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded 40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ... At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND HAWKINGS' UNMARKED.
C: TUMBLER
D: The Hemi Has Landed --
C: DONNY
D: Big deal. Now what?
C: MIRROR MAN
D: What we call: fun and shit.
N: And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model 'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel, razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear satisfied ...
C: TUMBLER
D: We can go now --

He senses something and turns to THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up, entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55 AM...

D: But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
N: Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
C: CALITRI
D: I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
N: Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet.. CALITRI (cont'd) It's an easier take. 30 cars. Two weeks. Most of them SUVs. Going to Russia. Think Kip'll be interested?
C: MEMPHIS
D: You don't want to even sniff at that --
N: Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she is smashed-to-shit.

C: MEMPHIS
D: Tell you what I'm not doing: I'm not gonna let you get into my Kool Aid...
N: And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw drowning out the sounds of combat ... Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ... Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ... He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into the floor ... Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ... And Atley is there ...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
C: MEMPHIS
D: My version of "take this job and shove it..."
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
N: But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious Calitri ... ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Now you done it. And with you gone - who'll save Kip the next time ... ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: This is all about there not being a next time, Atley --
N: And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the dead weight ... Dragging the don over to THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and Butz are there -
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Hello, boys -- !
C: DIGGER
D: Hey! What happened? Did they make it
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: They did not. A tragedy.
C: DIGGER
D: Mr. C. around?
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: He's napping. He said to take it away...
N: Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the van...
C: DIGGER
D: That'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Absolutely.
N: And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Point-five ...
N: And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Get outta here, Memphis --
N: And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Thank you...
N: Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley watches him go ...
C: ATLEY JACKSON
D: Hoo-boy.
S: EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK
N: Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's "Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on the back window. It's being driven by Kip...
C: MEMPHIS
D: What are you doing here?
C: KIP
D: I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Where'd you find this one?
C: KIP
D: Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
C: MEMPHIS
D: You boost her -- ?
C: KIP
D: Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
C: MEMPHIS
D: Move over ...
N: Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...
S: EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY
N: Memphis drives... Kip beside him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You okay -- ?
C: KIP
D: I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
N: Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers ... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough is enough ... He pulls over ... KIP (cont'd) What are you doing? You can outrun him...
C: MEMPHIS
D: It's over. The dumb shit is over ...
N: The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is, of course, Detective Castlebeck.
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I know you.
C: MEMPHIS
D: You know my back.
N: Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: It's finished, Randall. Get out of the car... You, too, kid...
N: Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.
C: RADIO
D: We have suspect vehicle matching description at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat: the suspect vehicle has just been apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal, 190 Street and Campanza ...
E: O.S.
N: Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.
C: KIP
D: I reported it ...
N: Memphis is impressed...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Not bad
N: ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: Dispatch, what's the license on the suspect vehicle... ?
C: RADIO
D: License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat: California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean.
E: O.S.
N: And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity plate that says - MY 67 ... DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK And he goes back over to Memphis ... DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) Looks like we live to fight another round. You're free to go ... Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) Your brother's a clever man and a talented thief, Kipling. But as role models go, you should observe the man, not the thief ...
C: KIP
D: Yes, sir ...
N: Castlebeck sighs...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a beautiful day, the birds are singing, and there's a container ship on Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...
N: Castlebeck nods ...
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Consider me gone, Detective --
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: I'll catch you later, Randall --
C: MEMPHIS
D: Double-meaning intended --
C: DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
D: You betcha --
N: And Memphis races off ...
S: EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY
N: Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All that cash...
C: MEMPHIS
D: Split it up. Any word on Donny?
C: OTTO
D: He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
C: MEMPHIS
D: What happened to Sway?
C: OTTO
D: She left...
N: He nods ... The boys are huddled together...
C: MIRROR MAN
D: Poor Toby, man...
N: A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:
C: THE SPHINX
D: If his premature demise has, in some way, enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired you to change your ways, then his death carries with it an inherent nobility. And a supreme glory. We should all be so fortunate. You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."
N: They all stare at him, stunned...
C: FREB
D: You spoke
N: The Sphinx shrugs...
C: TUMBLER
D: Say something else, man
N: But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut ... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills from the briefcase... To Kip:
C: MEMPHIS
D: You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
C: KIP
D: Sure, man --
C: MEMPHIS
D: She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
N: And he hands Kip the cash ...
C: KIP
D: You want me to buy her?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
N: Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...
C: OTTO
D: Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
C: MEMPHIS
D: I'll see you soon --
C: KIP
D: Where you off to -- ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Thought I'd go for a ride -
N: He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.
C: KIP
D: Hey, Memphis -- ?
N: Memphis turns back... KIP (cont'd) I'll see you, right? Memphis nods ...
C: MEMPHIS
D: You'll see me ...
N: And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:
S: INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY
N: Sway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down ... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He brings her to her feet ...
C: SWAY
D: What are you doing... ?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
N: And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from her cheek...
C: SWAY
D: I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and-- Where to -- ?
E: stops short; sees the new Eleanor outside
C: MEMPHIS
D: I dunno. I know a place.
N: She looks at him... Long and hard...
C: SWAY
D: This time it's for real?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
S: EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY
N: And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...
S: EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY
N: As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ... Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this one cold...
S: EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY
N: A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted, except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE. As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They stare at the casket, spooked.
C: BUTZ
D: Do you believe this?
C: DIGGER
D: What should we do?
C: BUTZ
D: We gotta do what we gotta do --
C: DIGGER
D: Shit. I hate the screamers, man. Why can't he finish the freakin' job?
C: BUTZ
D: Forget about it. Occupational hazard, Digger. C'mon...
N: And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- ! And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is covered in dirt. Gone. And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing about you/I just can't live without you/I really want you/ Eleanor near me...") CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY
N: Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs ... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --
C: MEMPHIS
D: What -- ?
C: SWAY
D: Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
C: MEMPHIS
D: She does have one thing you don't.
C: SWAY
D: What's that?
C: MEMPHIS
D: Bench seats.
N: And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides close... He throws his arm around her ... And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.") SING ON... And we hear:
C: MEMPHIS
D: You like bingo -- ?
E: O.S.
N: And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line ... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist pattern that is the American road. THE END
