S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47 The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small dog and a young girl emerge.
C: GIRL
D: Go on now Paul, don't be long.
N: The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch. The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground, bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.
C: GIRL
D: Paul... Paul? The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.
C: GIRL
D: Paul?! The glow fades again. MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble" by Paul Simon.
N: TITLE: PAUL
S: EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY
N: GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid. Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps. As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.
S: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight, the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of the blade. He nods appreciatively.
C: CLIVE
D: Beautiful piece.
C: VENDER
D: Damn straight. Practical performance. 100% Japanese, folded steel. Real hero shit.
C: CLIVE
D: How much?
N: VENDER $1,349.99. CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.
C: GRAHAM
D: Aren't you gonna get it?
C: CLIVE
D: No, it's rubbish.
S: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY
N: We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor, passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.
C: GRAHAM
D: What are you going to ask?
C: CLIVE
D: Do you feel that the killing of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3, invalidates Ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment?
C: GRAHAM
D: I was going to ask that!
N: CLIVE (IN KLINGON) Tough tits four eyes.
C: SECURITY
D: Alright, next! Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.
C: MICHAEL BIEHN
D: Hey there. Who's it to?
C: GRAHAM
D: Graham.
C: MICHAEL BIEHN
D: Graham.
C: GRAHAM
D: Uh... are you... did you?
C: MICHAEL BIEHN
D: There you go. SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.
C: MICHAEL BIEHN
D: Hey there. Who's it to?
C: CLIVE
D: Clive.
C: MICHAEL BIEHN
D: Clive.
C: CLIVE
D: Uh... are you... did you?
C: MICHAEL BIEHN
D: There you go. SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.
C: CLIVE
D: I... I need to photograph him.
C: SECURITY
D: You can take it from there. CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move off, looking at their spoils.
N: GRAHAM/CLIVE (HIGH FIVING) YES!
C: GRAHAM
D: That was amazing. I was actually a bit nervous.
C: CLIVE
D: Really? I wasn't.
C: GRAHAM
D: Good egg, wasn't he?
C: CLIVE
D: Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I forgot to give him my card. CLIVE points at SECURITY.
C: GRAHAM
D: Give it to Colossus.
C: CLIVE
D: Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!
C: GRAHAM
D: She NEEDS to call me.
S: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens. On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and down, making sure everything is in order.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Looks good, right?
C: CLIVE
D: Yes, it's very impressive.
C: PUBLICIST
D: It really does the image justice. I never noticed the third tit.
C: CLIVE
D: That was Graham's idea.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Ladies man, huh? You guys happy? You got enough pens? You wanna Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?
C: CLIVE
D: I'll have a fat Coke please?
C: PUBLICIST
D: A fat what?
C: CLIVE
D: Coke.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Oh you man a FAT Coke.
C: CLIVE
D: A what?
C: PUBLICIST
D: Fat coke.
C: CLIVE
D: Yes please.
C: GRAHAM
D: When do we start?
C: PUBLICIST
D: Ten minutes ago.
C: CLIVE
D: Why is it so quiet?
C: PUBLICIST
D: Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main pavillion.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains.
C: PUBLICIST
D: I can make a call.
C: CLIVE
D: Please.
C: PUBLICIST
D: It'll pick up when he's done.
C: GRAHAM
D: I'm nervous.
C: CLIVE
D: Don't be. The hard work's done, we have a great story and as usual your renderings jump from the page.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.
C: GRAHAM
D: Thank you.
C: CLIVE
D: All we have to do now is sit back and enjoy. A child approaches.
C: CLIVE
D: Queen Jelva welcomes thee.
C: CHILD
D: Do you know where Sylar's on?
C: CLIVE
D: Main pavillion.
C: CHILD
D: Thanks. Hey, three tits. Awesome.
S: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER
N: Caption: 50 MINUTES LATER They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do?
C: CLIVE
D: Three copies.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you should have given her four.
C: GRAHAM
D: That's sick.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper.
C: CLIVE
D: Yeah, but three copies?
C: PUBLICIST
D: Better than Carl Weathers.
N: CLIVE YES!
C: GRAHAM
D: Would you like a copy?
C: PUBLICIST
D: Are you nuts? My office is full of junk. The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.
C: CLIVE
D: Graham, I need a drink.
S: INT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.
S: INT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at a map. Other maps are scattered about.
C: CLIVE
D: It was like the Prancing Pony in there.
E: O.S.
C: GRAHAM
D: Nasty Hobbitses. CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs on a black leather cord.
C: CLIVE
D: They think they're so cool.
C: GRAHAM
D: Hey, are you excited about going to Area 51?
C: CLIVE
D: Hell yes.
C: GRAHAM
D: 06.30 check out?
C: CLIVE
D: A-ffirmative. GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.
C: CLIVE
D: Three, two, one...
C: GRAHAM CLIVE
D: Beep. Beep.
C: CLIVE
D: Good night, Graham.
C: GRAHAM
D: Good night, Clive. They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.
C: GRAHAM
D: Are you asleep?
C: CLIVE
D: No.
C: GRAHAM
D: Shall we try and storm the Citadel before we nod off?
C: CLIVE
D: Couldn't hurt could it? We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV. The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.
C: CLIVE
D: Cover me.
S: INT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the reception desk. His head hits the bell. DING!
S: EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
N: The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.
C: VALET
D: There you go.
C: GRAHAM
D: That's not ours.
C: VALET
D: No?
C: CLIVE
D: No, that's ours. A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of the range in its day. Still looks good.
C: VALET
D: Oh. GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.
C: VALET
D: Fucking Borg. Assimilate this! The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE can be heard whooping within.
E: giving the finger
S: INT. RV - MORNING
N: CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM fusses with maps and provisions.
C: GRAHAM
D: Breakfast?
C: CLIVE
D: Java. Straight up.
C: GRAHAM
D: Any solids?
C: CLIVE
D: No, let's punch through. Miles make the eggs taste sweeter.
C: GRAHAM
D: I love eggs!
C: CLIVE
D: I hear that. Now, get that "Joe' on the go and jump in the Chewie seat. I need your map skills.
C: GRAHAM
D: Good job I pre-pared. GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's seat.
E: Chewie
C: GRAHAM
D: It's a shame I don't have some controls on this side. That way, I could take over if you needed the loo.
C: CLIVE
D: Yeah, I could say "take the helm."
C: GRAHAM
D: "Take the helm, number one."
C: CLIVE
D: Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I need a number two." They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.
C: GRAHAM
D: "Least I've got Cerebro, eh?
C: CLIVE
D: Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi map and advanced geo-tagging with continual info stream?
C: GRAHAM
D: Impressive.
C: CLIVE
D: Most impressive.
C: GRAHAM
D: And let's not forget, we've always got Analogue. GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.
C: CLIVE
D: Not when we're driving Graham.
C: GRAHAM
D: Sorry. GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee percolator gurgles in the galley.
C: GRAHAM
D: Sounds like coffee o'clock.
C: CLIVE
D: Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've had my first cup of J. GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.
S: INT. DINER - DAY
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of prawns. He inspects the shells.
C: GRAHAM
D: Looks like a pile of dead droids. A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and awkward.
C: WAITRESS
D: You boys all set? Can I get you anything else? GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.
S: INT/EXT. RV - DAY
N: They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.
C: CLIVE
D: Amazing, isn't it? There are 295,734,134 people in this country and we haven't seen a soul for a hundred miles. Where is everybody?
C: GRAHAM
D: What about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking?
C: CLIVE
D: Apart from her. I suppose that's why they established the Dreamland facility out here.
C: GRAHAM
D: Far from prying eyes.
C: CLIVE
D: Did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh.
C: GRAHAM
D: Shall we have a bite before or after we hit the Black Mailbox?
C: CLIVE
D: Before.
S: INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51 related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor, speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two bumper stickers.
C: PAT
D: "Watch The Skies" or "Alien Onboard?" GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before looking back at PAT.
C: GRAHAM/CLIVE
D: "Alien Onboard."
C: PAT
D: Nice choice. So, where have you boys come from?
N: GRAHAM (MUMBLY) San Diego.
C: PAT
D: Comic-Con?
C: CLIVE
D: How could you tell? We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.
C: PAT
D: Just a guess. My nephew launched a comic down there a couple of years ago. Sort of dramatized the accounts of some of the folk we've had in here.
C: CLIVE
D: Encounter Briefs?
C: PAT
D: That's it. You heard of it, huh?
C: CLIVE
D: I've got all six.
C: PAT
D: Well whaddya know? Small world.
C: CLIVE
D: Do you get a lot of UFO types round here? We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.
C: PAT
D: Some.
C: GRAHAM
D: Have you ever seen one?
C: PAT
D: A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.
C: GRAHAM
D: Really?! You've seen more than one UFOs?
C: PAT
D: Well, I don't know what they were. So as far as I'm concerned they're unidentified and they were definitely flying.
C: CLIVE
D: And objects.
C: PAT
D: Damn straight. Whether or not they were spaceships, I can't say. Probably not, but I'd like to think they were. Be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe.
C: CLIVE
D: Did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons?
C: PAT
D: Yes.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh.
C: PAT
D: Makes you think though, don't it?
C: CLIVE
D: What?
C: PAT
D: Where is everybody? GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.
C: PAT
D: You boys all set?
C: CLIVE
D: I'd like a cup of coffee please.
C: PAT
D: Sure thing. How about you, sugar?
C: GRAHAM
D: Can I have an E.T. malt please?
C: PAT
D: You wanna sparkler in that? GRAHAM smiles coyly.
C: PAT
D: I'll take that as a yes. She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.
C: CLIVE
D: It's nice here, isn't it?
C: GRAHAM
D: Absolutely.
C: CLIVE
D: I think I might use the loo. CLIVE walks through a door marked "Maliens'. The adjacent toilet door enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.
E: GUS and JAKE
C: PAT
D: Yes dear, what can I get you?
C: JAKE
D: Two beers.
C: PAT
D: Coming right up.
S: INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING
N: CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.
C: CLIVE
D: That is absolutely amazing!
S: INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING
N: CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.
C: CLIVE
D: Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up into my palms. CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.
C: CLIVE
D: I'm joking, of course. They have a soap dispenser, shaped like an alien's head. When you pump his jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.
N: GRAHAM (MUMBLING) Clive...
C: CLIVE
D: It's hilarious. GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.
C: CLIVE
D: What? CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back. CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.
C: PAT
D: Here it comes! GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.
E: O.S.
C: PAT
D: Okay then, beers for you gentleman. A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt with a sparkler for the boys from outer space. The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.
C: PAT
D: So, where you boys headed?
C: JAKE
D: We're heading into Utah. Do ourselves some hunting.
C: GUS
D: Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps in front of the bangstick, right Jake? They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
C: JAKE
D: You got that right, Gus.
C: PAT
D: Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts up quite a fight.
C: GUS
D: That's what we're counting on. They nudge each other and laugh.
C: PAT
D: I better make you something good and hot. Long way to The Beehive. PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and fumbles for hi wallet.
N: He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him a wink. He leaves.
S: INT/EXT. RV - EVENING
N: GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The engine is running.
C: CLIVE
D: What took you so long?
C: GRAHAM
D: I was putting the sticker on.
C: CLIVE
D: They were an odd pair, weren't they?
C: GRAHAM
D: Definitely didn't speak Bocci. CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.
C: GRAHAM
D: That wasn't their truck was it?
E: CONT'D
C: CLIVE
D: No.
S: EXT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN - EVENING
N: The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.
S: INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his rear view.
C: GRAHAM
D: What's the matter?
C: CLIVE
D: Nothing. How we doing?
C: GRAHAM
D: We should be just about there. They scan the roadside for a few seconds.
C: CLIVE
D: I've found it.
C: GRAHAM
D: Where?
N: CLIVE THERE!!!
S: EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches. They wander over to a WHITE mailbox. GRAHAM/CLIVE (REVERENTIALLY) The Black Mailbox. GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.
C: CLIVE
D: It's amazing, isn't it? We're actually here.
C: GRAHAM
D: Area 51.
C: CLIVE
D: Dreamland.
C: GRAHAM
D: The Groom Lake Military Test Facility.
C: CLIVE
D: MacArthur's Black Mile.
C: GRAHAM
D: Is that a real one?
C: CLIVE
D: No, I made it up myself.
C: GRAHAM
D: I like it.
C: CLIVE
D: Be great if we saw something.
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft.
C: CLIVE
D: That would be incredible. It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast. Whoosh.
C: GRAHAM
D: What would you do if they actually landed?
C: CLIVE
D: Keep it together. First contact is a big responsibility. They come in peace, we go to pieces? That's not how I roll. CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.
C: CLIVE
D: What's wrong? GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's them. They found us. I don't know how but they found us.
C: CLIVE
D: Who? Who's found us?
C: GRAHAM
D: The Libyans!
C: CLIVE
D: Run for it Marty! GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.
S: INT. RV - NIGHT
N: CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.
C: GRAHAM
D: Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps whoever it was turned doff.
C: CLIVE
D: Of course it's them. We're dead. It's like Deliverance. They're going to rape us and break our arms.
C: GRAHAM
D: I don't want my arms broken!
C: CLIVE
D: There's only one thing for it.
C: GRAHAM
D: What?
C: CLIVE
D: I'm gonna have to fly blind.
N: CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness, still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.
C: CLIVE
D: Probably best not to do that. I couldn't really see anything. They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh God, oh God, oh God.
C: GRAHAM
D: I need the toilet.
C: CLIVE
D: Me too. The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.
C: CLIVE
D: They're trying to overtake.
C: GRAHAM
D: Don't let them get past.
C: CLIVE
D: Should I ram them?
C: GRAHAM
D: What about the deposit? CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times, bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.
C: CLIVE
D: It wasn't them. The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out of the window.
C: CLIVE
D: We should see if they're okay.
C: GRAHAM
D: I still need a wee.
C: CLIVE
D: I can hold mine. GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.
C: GRAHAM
D: The bulb's gone in there.
S: EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car. Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.
C: CLIVE
D: Hello? They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.
C: GRAHAM
D: Maybe you should call for help. GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.
C: VOICE
D: I wouldn't do that if I were you. GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large, black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.
E: O.S.
C: CLIVE
D: I rather think these men need help. Graham, give me the phone. GRAHAM passes the phone over.
C: VOICE
D: Seriously, I wouldn't do that. GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone to his ear. We hear the operator.
C: OPERATOR
D: 911 Emergency. How may I direct your call? Hello? Hello? GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an
N: ALIEN.
C: ALIEN
D: Put - the phone - down. Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump. GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.
C: GRAHAM
D: What have you done to him?
C: ALIEN
D: I didn't do anything. He fainted.
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes but you made him faint.
C: ALIEN
D: I did not. Okay I did, but it's not like i set my phaser to "Faint'.
C: GRAHAM
D: You've got a phaser!?
C: ALIEN
D: No! Look, I need you to help. Can you get this guy back onto your wagon?
C: GRAHAM
D: Are you going to probe us?
C: ALIEN
D: No! Where does that come from? Why do people always assume we want to stick something up their ass?
C: GRAHAM
D: Don't you?
C: ALIEN
D: No. There's certainly nothing about it in the encounter manual. As a rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe people find it easier to deal with earthly transgressions if they suppress it with absurd fantasies about alien probing.
C: GRAHAM
D: What?
C: ALIEN
D: It's just a theory. Listen, focus okay? I promise you I won't hurt you, I just need your help.
C: GRAHAM
D: You need my help?
C: ALIEN
D: Yes.
C: GRAHAM
D: How come I can understand you? Are you using some sort of neural language router?
C: ALIEN
D: No, I'm speaking English you prick. Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your name?
E: off GRAHAM's expression
C: GRAHAM
D: Graham Willy.
C: ALIEN
D: What about him?
C: GRAHAM
D: That's the writer, Clive Gollings.
C: ALIEN
D: Well, let's get Clive into the RV and get going. I'll explain everything on the way. Please.
C: GRAHAM
D: Where are we going?
C: ALIEN
D: North.
C: GRAHAM
D: The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.
C: ALIEN
D: Well, then we're gonna have to hustle, aren't we?
N: GRAHAM BUT-
C: ALIEN
D: Look Graham, you're just gonna have to trust me, okay? GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall. His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers clasp together, pleading.
C: ALIEN
D: Please man, I need you. GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.
C: GRAHAM
D: Okay then.
C: ALIEN
D: Great. Thank you.
C: GRAHAM
D: What's your name?
C: ALIEN
D: I'm Paul.
C: GRAHAM
D: Paul?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the fuck off MacArthur's Black Mile. They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.
C: PAUL
D: Oh man, has he...?
E: CONT'D
C: GRAHAM
D: I told him he should have gone.
C: PAUL
D: Could have been worse. Know what I'm saying? They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV. He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV starts up and drives off.
S: INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.
C: PAUL
D: Can I have this ham?
C: GRAHAM
D: Uh... yes.
C: PAUL
D: Great! PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth, wolfing it down hungrily.
C: GRAHAM
D: Paul? Where am I going again?
C: PAUL
D: I told you, North. Do you have a map? GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.
C: PAUL
D: Not when we're driving, Graham.
N: The map disappears back up into the roller.
C: GRAHAM
D: Sorry.
C: PAUL
D: Just head North. We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them.
C: GRAHAM
D: Them? Who's them?
S: EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first. The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time. Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A SOLDIER approaches.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Sir?
C: ZOIL
D: Talk to me.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Three survivors, company men, hurt but alive.
C: ZOIL
D: Anyone else?
C: CAPTAIN
D: No sir. ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.
C: CAPTAIN
D: What's this? The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet. ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.
C: CAPTAIN
D: What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?
C: ZOIL
D: No. It's neither of those things. He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to his car and hits a button on the dash.
C: VOICE
D: What's the situation?
C: ZOIL
D: We have a guest who's left the hotel without paying, sir.
C: VOICE
D: Damn it! Do you think he's "left' left?
C: ZOIL
D: Doubtful. NORAD would have picked up a bogie. Those guys can track Santa. No sir, he's still here. Question is, for how long?
C: VOICE
D: Don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence?
C: ZOIL
D: How so?
C: VOICE
D: I signed the red document this morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's odd that he chooses today to go AWOL? How did he know?
C: ZOIL
D: Are you suggesting he has someone on the inside.
C: VOICE
D: Maybe.
C: ZOIL
D: Well he's definitely got someone on the outside.
C: VOICE
D: What?
C: ZOIL
D: Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks... among other things. I'd bet my left nut that little bastard's hitched a ride.
C: VOICE
D: Lock down the area. Road blocks, spot checks, the whole nine yards. You're going to handle this personally, Zoil. I want this wrapped up before Letterman.
S: EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER
N: Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV. Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the bathroom door. The toilet flushes. CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.
C: PAUL
D: The bulb's gone in there. CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives, PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.
C: PAUL
D: I hate it when you get the closed ones, right?
C: GRAHAM
D: I usually bite them open.
C: PAUL
D: Are you fucking insane? You gotta tap "em and if they don't open you throw them away.
C: GRAHAM
D: That's molluscs.
C: PAUL
D: Shut up.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's true.
N: (NOTICES CLIVE) Hello Clive! How are you feeling?
C: CLIVE
D: I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL MAD, Graham. If that is your name? You're happily sitting there chatting to... to... that, like it's the most natural thing in the world. The two of you laughing away like you haven't seen each other since 1990. PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.
C: CLIVE
D: So forgive me if I seem a little rattled but from where I'm standing it would appear you are trading nut knowledge with an alien life form.
E: CONT'D
C: GRAHAM
D: His name is Paul.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul Reiser?
C: PAUL
D: Just Paul. You know, like Madonna or Dracula.
C: GRAHAM
D: Paul's from a small planet in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.
C: CLIVE
D: No he is not!
C: PAUL
D: I am man, seriously.
C: CLIVE
D: How could he possibly have travelled that distance?
C: PAUL
D: Wormhole.
C: CLIVE
D: Balls! Graham, this isn't what it seems. What about Ocham's Razor?
C: GRAHAM
D: The hairdressers?
C: CLIVE
D: Yes, the old man who owns it told me that, in unbelievable circumstances, the most plausible explanation is usually the truth.
C: PAUL
D: And what's the most plausible explanation, Clive?
C: CLIVE
D: That you're a thin midget in an alien costume.
C: PAUL
D: There's no such thing as a thin midget? Those guys are built. Have you not seen The Station Agent?
C: GRAHAM
D: He's right. I think that's less believable than Paul being form a planet in the norther spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh really? With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin, trying to gain a hold of a mask.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Ow! Get off me!
C: CLIVE
D: You're not real. You're not real!
C: GRAHAM
D: Excuse me.
C: PAUL
D: Get off me, you fucking psycho!
N: GRAHAM
C: EXCUSE ME!
D: CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh shit! CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.
C: CLIVE
D: Where's he gone?
C: GRAHAM
D: Maybe he beamed up.
C: CLIVE
D: As if. We would have seen the classic shimmer and hum.
C: GRAHAM
D: Good point.
C: BANG, BANG, BANG!
D: GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.
S: EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV. AGENT 1 Where you boys from? Australia?
C: CLIVE
D: Britain.
N: AGENT 1 Ah. G'day mate. The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified. AGENT 1 Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?
C: CLIVE/GRAHAM
D: Comic-con.
N: AGENT 1 You're a long way from San Diego.
C: CLIVE
D: We were having a little drive.
N: AGENT 1 Is that right? AGENT 2 (O.S.) Hey Haggard?!
C: HAGGARD
D: Yeah? O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.
C: O'REILLY
D: These guys have met Michael Biehn.
C: HAGGARD
D: No shit! How was he?
C: CLIVE
D: He was a good egg.
C: GRAHAM
D: Very unaffected.
C: HAGGARD
D: That's nice to hear.
N: (TO AGENT 2) O'Reilly? Anything else?
C: O'REILLY
D: Just some pissy jeans. HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits. CLIVE look embarrassed.
C: HAGGARD
D: Okay, you guys can go.
C: CLIVE
D: Thank you. May I ask what you're searching for?
C: HAGGARD
D: Of course you may. There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.
S: INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused and shaken.
C: CLIVE
D: Well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it?
C: GRAHAM
D: Is it?
C: CLIVE
D: Yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien. I mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it?
C: GRAHAM
D: I suppose so.
C: CLIVE
D: Than that's what happened. PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.
N: PAUL WRONG!
S: EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT
N: The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.
S: INT. RV - NIGHT
C: CLIVE
D: Where the hell did you go?
C: PAUL
D: Nowhere.
C: GRAHAM
D: What, you went invisible?
C: PAUL
D: It's not invisibility per so. It's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure.
C: GRAHAM
D: Like Predator?
C: PAUL
D: Exactly.
C: GRAHAM
D: Can you do it whenever you want?
N: PAUL (PREDATOR VOICE) Anytime...
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road into the night.
S: INT. RV - DAYBREAK
N: CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.
C: CLIVE
D: No thank you.
C: PAUL
D: You sure? How about a cup of coffee? Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice cuppa J. PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.
E: sees he's tempted
C: PAUL
D: Hey, look who's up!
C: GRAHAM
D: Hello Paul. GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.
C: GRAHAM
D: What's the matter?
C: CLIVE
D: Graham, there is a Grey in the galley, making me coffee.
C: GRAHAM
D: Did you want tea?
C: CLIVE
D: No, I don't want tea.
C: GRAHAM
D: Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't it?
C: CLIVE
D: No, what's wried, Graham, is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it!
C: GRAHAM
D: He needs our help, Clive. PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.
C: PAUL CLIVE
D: You got it? Yes I've got it.
C: PAUL CLIVE
D: It's hot. Thank you. GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...
E: slightly testy
C: PAUL
D: Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you. Am i right? CLIVE doesn't deny it.
C: PAUL
D: And I appreciate the fact that I have somewhat gate-crashed the party here but, truth be told, I'm in a hell of a pickle. I really need your help.
C: CLIVE
D: Why us?
C: PAUL
D: Why not? CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.
C: CLIVE
D: What about the RV? It has to be back in two days.
C: GRAHAM
D: Clive, he's an alien. A living, breathing, alien. CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.
C: CLIVE
D: I suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension. PAUL looks super-pleased.
C: CLIVE
D: How did you get here?
C: PAUL
D: Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.
C: GRAHAM
D: Happens to the best of us.
C: PAUL
D: Also, I'm a shit driver.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!
C: PAUL
D: Roswell was a smoke-screen man, designed to distract from the truth.
C: CLIVE
D: They invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash?
C: PAUL
D: I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?
C: CLIVE
D: What have you been doing here all this time?
C: PAUL
D: Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting the shit. Advising the government.
C: GRAHAM
D: Not just the government.
S: INT. ROOM - DAY
N: CAPTION: 1980 A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and chair. PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a cigarette, whilst talking on the phone. We hear the voice on the other end of the line. It is strangely familiar.
C: STEVEN SPIELBERG
D: ...I want him to have some kind of special power, you know? Something sort of messianic...
C: PAUL
D: How about molecular revivification.
C: STEVEN SPIELBERG
D: I don't know what that is.
C: PAUL
D: Restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of cellular intrinsic field memory.
C: STEVEN SPIELBERG
D: I...uh...
C: PAUL
D: Healing, Steven.
C: STEVEN SPIELBERG
D: Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort of thing? His little finger could light up at the end and-
C: PAUL
D: You know what? Sometimes, less is more. The line beeps.
C: STEVEN SPIELBERG
D: You got another call?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah I gotta take this man. It's the fucking V guys again.
S: INT. RV - DAY
C: PAUL
D: Right.
C: GRAHAM
D: You'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture generally over the last 60 years.
N: CLIVE (TO GRAHAM) How come you know so much?
C: GRAHAM
D: We had quite a long chat while you were unconscious. CLIVE looks miffed.
C: GRAHAM
D: ...while you were asleep.
C: PAUL
D: You want a bagel Clive?
C: CLIVE
D: No thanks.
C: PAUL
D: Graham?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes please.
C: CLIVE
D: Go on then, I'll have half.
C: PAUL
D: You want anything on it?
E: O.S.
C: CLIVE
D: Jam.
C: PAUL
D: What?
E: O.S.
C: CLIVE
D: Jelly.
C: PAUL
D: Gotcha. PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.
C: GRAHAM
D: I gave your jeans a swill and hung them up.
C: CLIVE
D: Thank you. So, do you know where we're going?
C: GRAHAM
D: Just North. He said we had to make a right at Utah.
C: CLIVE
D: Why can't he tell us?
C: GRAHAM
D: He said it was a surprise.
C: CLIVE
D: Do you trust him, Graham? I mean, is he Strider or Black Rider?
C: GRAHAM
D: Strider, definitely.
C: CLIVE
D: You'd better be right. I don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's okay, he doesn't do that. PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.
C: PAUL
D: Bagel time! The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.
C: GRAHAM
D: Fuel level's critical.
C: PAUL
D: Sorry, I had a warning light just like that on my ship.
C: GRAHAM
D: For fuel?
C: PAUL
D: Anti-grav failure. CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.
C: CLIVE
D: There's a place called Ely five miles from here. It's small but there should be a gas station.
C: GRAHAM
D: Roger that, number one.
N: CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look. PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks".
S: INT. RV - MORNING
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.
C: CLIVE
D: Paul, don't do that!
C: PAUL
D: Here's what I need. Some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas.
C: CLIVE
D: You know this is a gas station? PAUL looks disappointed.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
N: The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.
C: CLIVE
D: Ready?
C: GRAHAM
D: Ready. HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.
C: PAUL
D: Get me some more peanut M&Ms. GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.
E: O.S.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: After you.
C: CLIVE
D: Thanks.
S: EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING
N: Close up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands.
C: O'REILLY
D: Coming... ready or not! O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL. ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.
C: ZOIL
D: Orange?
C: O'REILLY
D: No thanks.
C: ZOIL
D: Nice and juicy.
C: O'REILLY
D: I don't want to spoil breakfast.
C: ZOIL
D: Do you mind telling me what's going on, Agent?
C: O'REILLY
D: Just keeping ourselves occupied sir. Things are pretty slow.
C: ZOIL
D: Where's the other one?
C: O'REILLY
D: I don't know, let's see. Haggard? HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over.
C: HAGGARD
D: Sorry, I was just... hiding.
C: ZOIL
D: I see. You fellas had much traffic through here?
C: HAGGARD
D: Just a big RV driven by a couple of nerds.
C: ZOIL
D: Nerds, huh?
C: HAGGARD
D: Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and met Michael Biehn.
C: ZOIL
D: I've heard he's nice.
C: HAGGARD
D: Good egg.
C: O'REILLY
D: Very unaffected.
C: ZOIL
D: Did you search the vehicle thoroughly?
C: O'REILLY
D: Yes sir.
C: ZOIL
D: Find anything?
C: O'REILLY
D: Not really. Just Michael Biehn's autograph and some pissy jeans. Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.
C: ZOIL
D: Did you get the license plate? HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.
C: ZOIL
D: Make? More sheepishness.
C: HAGGARD
D: It was big.
C: ZOIL
D: I want everything you can remember. Descriptions of the occupants, height, hair, distinguishing features. We can do it on the way.
C: HAGGARD
D: On the way?
C: ZOIL
D: You're coming with me.
C: O'REILLY
D: What about the road block sir?
C: ZOIL
D: It didn't work.
S: INT. GAS STATION - MORNING
N: GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms.
C: CLIVE
D: Don't you think that's a bit much? Put it all back. Except the burrito... and the doughnuts... and the chocolate milk. Let's just pay for it and leave.
C: GRAHAM
D: We need bulb for the toilet.
C: CLIVE
D: Essential only, Graham! They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Morning Chris!
C: CHRIS
D: Hey Dean.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Who do you think I had in my office this morning?
C: CHRIS
D: Jeremy Piven?
C: STATE TROOPER
D: No. The Secret Service. GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it tumbling. CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over.
C: CHRIS
D: They find out how you can afford a Dodge Viper on troopers pay?
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Not yet. They're all over this crash on the road up to Rachel.
C: CHRIS
D: What you think's going on?
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Don't know, could be Muslims.
C: CHRIS
D: Jesus Cheeerist! CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: You go right ahead.
C: CLIVE
D: Thank you very much, officer.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Where're you guys from?
C: GRAHAM
D: Britain.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns!
C: CHRIS
D: No guns? Jesus Cheeerist. CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER and CHRIS watch them go.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING
N: The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear the radio spring to life as they pass.
C: POLICE CONTROLLER
D: All units, be on the lookout for a cream and brown Recreational Vehicle, no plate number at this time. Officers are advised to contain but not board. Dean, if you still at Gas and Go, bring back a quart a milk and a box of doughnut holes? Dean? GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.
N: HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK!
S: INT. RV - SOMETIME LATER
N: PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.
C: CLIVE
D: It's find for you. You'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay. PAUL laughs.
C: CLIVE
D: Why's everything so funny? They think we're Muslims.
C: PAUL
D: That's their excuse for everything. There are worse things you can be. We had a Muslim guy at the base. Systems analyst called Yusef. We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights. You should'a heard him do Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum.
C: CLIVE
D: Paul, the authorities know we're in an TV.
C: PAUL
D: We're hardly the only RV on the road. Trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey. BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps. GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.
S: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
N: The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out. The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.
C: PAUL
D: Fuck, that made me jump.
C: CLIVE
D: Ah yes, the waspish markings of a Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.
C: PAUL
D: What a waste.
C: GRAHAM
D: Poor thing.
C: CLIVE
D: Nothing anyone could've done. PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.
C: GRAHAM
D: What are you doing? PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what they are seeing.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's a miracle!
N: PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.
C: PAUL
D: I'll miss these.
C: CLIVE
D: Why would you do that?
C: PAUL
D: I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am
N: I?
S: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
N: ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: By the time I got the bulletin, they were long gone. Seemed like nice fellas to me.
C: CHRIS
D: Is it true they was Muslims?
C: STATE TROOPER
D: They said they were British.
C: ZOIL
D: I think you can be both.
C: CHRIS
D: Jesus Cheeeeerist!
C: HAGGARD
D: Agent Zoil?
C: ZOIL
D: Excuse me gentlemen. ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The voice of ZOIL's superior cuts the air.
C: VOICE
D: Report.
C: ZOIL
D: We've tracked them down to a gas station in Ely.
C: VOICE
D: So why am I not witting with my feet up, smoking a jay, watching Erin Brockovich?
C: ZOIL
D: We think he may be travelling in an RV with two British men sir.
C: VOICE
D: Goddamnit, I knew we should have gone ahead with invasion in "44. What are they, MI6?
C: ZOIL
D: No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on the lamb from Comic-Con.
C: VOICE
D: Shit. My sister's kid went to that. Little Manga faggot.
C: ZOIL
D: I still think this stinks, sir.
C: VOICE
D: Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much of a coincidence. He sits tight for 60 years and then suddenly now he decides to take off. If he wanted to go home so bad, he could've just given us the slip when he was playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.
C: ZOIL
D: Someone must have told him. We need to find the rat.
C: VOICE
D: Leave that to me. In the meantime, if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M. then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a new A. O.K.?
C: ZOIL
D: Yes sir.
S: INT. RV - DUSK
N: GRAHAM is sat in the Chewie seat, PAUL is reading Jelva, Queen Of The Varvak. CLIVE drives.
C: GRAHAM
D: What do you think?
C: PAUL
D: Ask me when I've finished it. CLIDE rubs his yes.
C: GRAHAM
D: You tired, Sausage?
N: CLIVE (WHISPERING) Don't call me Sausage in front of him.
C: GRAHAM
D: Sorry. Are you tired though?
C: CLIVE
D: Mummy, I am bushed.
C: GRAHAM
D: What do you need?
C: CLIVE
D: Best case, I'd like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal.
C: GRAHAM
D: I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still call you Big-Rig can't I?
C: CLIVE
D: Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck with an RV park? We need somewhere off the beaten track, n'est pas?
C: GRAHAM
D: Roger that. Cup of Joe?
C: CLIVE
D: You read my mind. GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.
C: CLIVE
D: Can I help you?
C: PAUL
D: You want a cigarette?
C: CLIVE
D: No, thank you. I don't smoke. PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.
C: PAUL
D: Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating the bird. CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the coffee and a Honey Bun cake.
C: GRAHAM
D: Honey Bun?
C: CLIVE
D: Could you unwrap it for me?
C: GRAHAM
D: By your command.
N: GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL watches. GRAHAM disappears to the back of the RV.
C: PAUL
D: Let me ask you something. Are you to...?
C: CLIVE
D: What?
C: PAUL
D: You know... PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating various "group' and "one on one' homosexual practices.
C: CLIVE
D: No!
C: PAUL
D: Okay, that's great. I just wondered. I'm cool with it. Everyone's "bi' where I'm from. It's all about the pleasure thing, you know? We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like "smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum.
C: CLIVE
D: What are you trying to say?
C: PAUL
D: Maybe you should start smoking.
S: INT. RV - EVENING
N: Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park. GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind, steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.
C: CLIVE
D: Great find, Graham.
C: GRAHAM
D: I sourced a website listing off the beaten track, North American RV parks.
C: PAUL
D: I really lucked out with you nerds, didn't I? GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over. GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's awfully quiet.
C: CLIVE
D: Just the way we like it. PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on the horn.
N: HOOOOOOONNNNK!
C: CLIVE
D: Stop doing that!
C: GRAHAM
D: Someone's coming. PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.
C: VOICE
D: Hello?
C: CLIVE
D: We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.
E: quietly to Graham
C: GRAHAM
D: I don't think she heard you.
C: CLIVE
D: I was talking to you.
C: GRAHAM
D: Oh, sorry.
C: VOICE
D: Hello? GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid- twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You".
C: RUTH
D: Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.
C: CLIVE
D: Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come in?
C: RUTH
D: Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is $50 for the night, plus $10 for hook ups an I'll need to hang onto an ID too. CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.
C: GRAHAM
D: We're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest.
C: RUTH
D: Where you heading next?
C: GRAHAM
D: Uh, east... apparently. CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.
C: RUTH
D: England?
C: CLIVE
D: Yes. London.
C: RUTH
D: I love London.
C: CLIVE
D: Have you been?
C: RUTH
D: No. Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?
C: GRAHAM/CLIVE
D: Yes.
C: RUTH
D: Oh. I'd love to go someday.
C: GRAHAM
D: You should.
C: RUTH
D: There's lots a places I wanna go. Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The world's a big place. I need one of these though.
C: CLIVE
D: You don't have a passport? RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.
C: MALE VOICE
D: RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: That's my father. I'll come over and take your money in the morning. Have a pleasant night now, won't you? RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM watches RUTH intently as they pass.
C: CLIVE
D: Doors to manual and cross check. Graham? Graham?
C: GRAHAM
D: Hmmm? PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.
N: PAUL BOO!
S: EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT
N: RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns back, and goes inside.
S: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
N: RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette. From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: What took you so long?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: I was just talking.
N: RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: You talk to much.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Sorry Papa.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: How long they staying?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Just the night I think
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Hook ups?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Uh-huh.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Where they headed?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: East.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Them California plates I saw?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Yes, but they're from London.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: London, Ohio?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: No, London, England.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Where?!
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: England, Papa. It's in North Western Europe. The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Europe? I'll give you Europe, missy. Now, get and make my supper. MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.
S: EXT. RV PARK - LATER
N: QUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the RV and prepare a small BBQ.
S: INT. RV - MOMENTS LATER
N: The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in. PAUL lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps.
C: PAUL
D: Arrghh, what the fuck?!
C: GRAHAM
D: Hungry?
C: PAUL
D: I ate already. GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.
C: PAUL
D: Too soon? They nod.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break bread with you guys. What are we having? GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.
C: GRAHAM
D: Willies! PAUL gives CLIVE a "see what I mean?' look.
C: CLIVE
D: I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's my forte. CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and slams the door of the RV behind him.
S: EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT
N: CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.
C: PAUL
D: Hello Clive. From the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue, am I do assume you're a Hendrix fan?
C: CLIVE
D: I am actually, yes.
C: PAUL
D: I met him once.
C: CLIVE
D: Really?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He thought I was a hallucination. Shame what happened to him.
C: CLIVE
D: All the good ones die.
C: PAUL
D: Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases album seventeen. PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.
C: CLIVE
D: So you've been here for 60 years?
C: PAUL
D: I know, right? Time flies when you're confined to a U.S. military installation.
C: CLIVE
D: Why did you come to earth?
C: PAUL
D: I'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force.
C: CLIVE
D: What?!
C: PAUL
D: I'm fucking with you, man. I was on a science mission actually. Meteorological reconnaissance. We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class planets. My specialist subject is tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field.
N: (MORE)
C: PAUL
D: Next thing I know, this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to Area 52.
E: CONT'D
N: CLIVE
C: PAUL
D: No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit. It's another "clever subterfuge." GRAHAM joins them with the food.
C: PAUL
D: Just telling him about Area 52.
C: GRAHAM
D: Ha ha yeah.
C: PAUL
D: So, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing.
C: CLIVE
D: Mulder was right!
C: PAUL
D: Mulder was my idea. They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.
C: CLIVE
D: Would you like a go? PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.
S: EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
N: RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted against the campfire. She frowns. MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
C: RUTH!
D: RUTH backs away into the shadows.
S: INT. RV - MORNING
N: It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa. There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.
C: CLIVE
D: Who is it?
C: RUTH
D: It's Ruth. GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Good morning.
C: CLIVE
D: Good morning.
C: RUTH
D: May I come in?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes. CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.
C: RUTH
D: Was everything to your liking?
C: CLIVE
D: Yes, thank you.
C: RUTH
D: Where's the other one?
C: CLIVE
D: The other one?
C: RUTH
D: It's okay, we don't charge by the person. That was three pairs of legs I saw last night cavorting round the camp fire, right?
C: CLIVE
D: Oh the other one. Um...
C: PAUL
D: I'm in the can. I ate a closed mollusc. PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.
C: GRAHAM
D: I like your shirt. The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"
C: RUTH
D: Thanks. I got it at my church.
C: GRAHAM
D: Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin?
N: RUTH (BRIGHTLY) Because of his theories. Are you men of God?
C: GRAHAM
D: Would you like a coffee?
C: CLIVE
D: I suppose we're men of science.
N: GRAHAM
C: CLIVE-
D: RUTH narrow her eye.
C: CLIVE
D: If we believe in anything it would be macro evolution. Cause and effect. The establishment of a biological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos. RUTH looks scandalized.
C: GRAHAM
D: Or it could be God. You just don't know do you?
C: RUTH
D: God created the earth in six days and on the seventh he rested. PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.
C: CLIVE
D: Did you know that the universe has been dated as being 13.5 billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes.
C: CLIVE
D: Not you!
C: RUTH
D: The world is 4000 years old.
C: PAUL
D: Oh come on!
E: O.S.
N: GRAHAM PAUL-
C: PAUL
D: Horseshit! RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being.
C: PAUL
D: Oh, don't give me that old irreducible complexity crap-
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: They eye is comprised of three interacting parts. Remove any one of them and it ceases to exist. It has the precision and delicacy of a pocket watch and, when the good Lord permits, it works in perfect harmony with its environment. Something as functionally perfect as that doesn't just occur without the intervention of a guiding hand.
C: PAUL
D: But it didn't just occur did it? It is the culmination of millions of years of development across countless species.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: What are you talking about?
C: PAUL
D: Evolution baby. RUTH screams and bangs the door.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: It'd design!
C: PAUL
D: If He designed it, why didn't He just make it one part and take the whole weekend off?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Nothing you can so or do can shake my belief, or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that God made Heaven and earth and created us all in His own image.
C: PAUL
D: Oh yeah? Well then how do you explain me? RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls up, her hair turns white. She collapses.
E: stepping out of the toilet
C: PAUL
D: And that's Jenga.
C: CLIVE
D: What did you do that for?
C: PAUL
D: I didn't do anything, she fainted.
C: CLIVE
D: She saw you!
C: PAUL
D: Oh come on. Who's gonna believe anything she says?
C: CLIVE
D: The authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing.
C: PAUL
D: What, a delusional, one-eyed God botherer?
C: CLIVE
D: Paul, right now they're going to follow any lead they can get.
C: PAUL
D: I didn't think of that.
C: GRAHAM
D: We could take her with us.
C: PAUL/CLIVE
D: What?
C: GRAHAM
D: We're only going to be a couple of days. We could let her go once Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll be fine once she gets to know us. PAUL and CLIVE consider this.
C: CLIVE
D: How am I going to get my passport back? PAUL vanishes.
C: PAUL
D: Leave it to me.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
N: The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport. He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.
C: PAUL
D: Hallelujah.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Ruth, what in the Lord's name- MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for a second.
E: O.S.
C: PAUL
D: Boo?
S: EXT. RV PARK - DAY
N: PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is loading a shotgun. PAUL
C: GO! GO! GO!
D: The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the RV careens off out of the trailer park.
S: INT. RV - DAY
N: Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives, GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.
C: GRAHAM
D: Hi.
C: RUTH
D: Where am I? PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, look who's up.
N: RUTH DEMON!
C: GRAHAM
D: Would you like a cup of tea? RUTH starts to pray furiously.
C: GRAHAM
D: I'm so sorry it had to be this way Ruth. We're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can. We were just a little concerned that you might call the police.
C: RUTH
D: You have been deceived. Deceived by an agent of Satan himself.
C: PAUL
D: You know I'm sitting right here?
E: O.S.
C: GRAHAM
D: He's not a demon Ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home. He's not evil. He's just very rude.
C: RUTH
D: How can he be from another world? There is only one world. Our world, created by God the Father. PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.
C: PAUL
D: Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies. Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone.
C: RUTH
D: How could that possibly make me feel any better?
C: PAUL
D: Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice!
C: GRAHAM
D: I think what Paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world.
C: RUTH
D: This isn't happening! You're a hallucination. You're not real. You're a test. A test from God.
C: PAUL
D: You can't win can you? RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an awful noise.
C: CLIVE
D: I can't drive like this. We'll have to drop her off and take our chances.
C: GRAHAM
D: No!
C: PAUL
D: Oh, for God's sake. PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.
C: GRAHAM
D: What did you do to her?!
C: PAUL
D: I broadened her horizons.
C: GRAHAM
D: Can you broaden mine?
C: PAUL
D: No, it's tiring. GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.
C: GRAHAM
D: Oh please.
C: PAUL
D: Come here then. PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh great! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable.
C: PAUL
D: Can't I just tell you?
C: CLIVE
D: No spoilers! PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.
N: GRAHAM (WEAKLY) Maybe I should make that tea?
S: EXT. RV PARK - DAY
N: THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: I didn't call the government. I called the po-lice.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
C: ZOIL
D: Given your description of the intruder, the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: And who are you?
C: ZOIL
D: Secret Service, sir.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: I knew it. You know that devil took my Ruth.
C: ZOIL
D: And Ruth's your daughter?
C: MOSES BEHE
D: That's right. Her Mama died when she was born. I good as brought her up by myself. Wasn't easy either. Two mouths to feed and this place to run.
C: ZOIL
D: I understand. Do you have a photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe? MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes intact and with dark hair.
C: ZOIL
D: She's pretty. MOSES snorts.
C: ZOIL
D: Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In case she tries to contact you.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: I do... ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his satellite phone, moving into a different room.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: ...and she'll call me if she can. Ruth's never really been outta Carbon County.
C: ZOIL
D: You say they went East?
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge if they ain't using the interstate, there's been a rig spill just South of Dutch John.
C: ZOIL
D: So?
C: MOSES BEHE
D: So that means they'll be on the 44. Only way to go. ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.
C: ZOIL
D: Let's go. Haggard!
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Tell me you're gonna kill that thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what it is.
C: ZOIL
D: We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Watch yourself now. I seen its eyes. It's evil. ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: God's speed, Mr. Zoil.
S: EXT. RV PARK - DAY
N: ZOIL's radio crackles to life.
C: HAGGARD
D: Man, that way was one fat freak!
E: O.S.
C: O'REILLY
D: If I was that girl, I think I'd rather take my chances with the alien. HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.
E: O.S.
C: ZOIL
D: Can it, you two! How many times do I have to tell you?
S: INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
N: MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over the radio.
C: ZOIL
D: We do not refer to the target as "The Alien'. MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying in the foreground on the kitchen table. We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY
N: MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.
S: INT. RV - DAY
N: CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.
C: PAUL
D: Wow. Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE, looking out through the RV's windshield. We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty. They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking out across the vista.
C: PAUL
D: There it is, boys. Wyoming.
C: CLIVE
D: Is that where we're going?
C: PAUL
D: Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd aren't onto something. I mean look at it. Hey Ruth, get up here. They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.
C: PAUL
D: Ruth!?
C: CLIVE
D: Someone should go after her. Graham? CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.
C: CLIVE
D: Graham!?
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: RUTH is storming up the road.
C: GRAHAM
D: Ruth!
C: RUTH
D: Leave me alone!
C: GRAHAM
D: Ruth, please stop, I've got shin splints. RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.
C: GRAHAM
D: Are you alright?
C: RUTH
D: He can't be from space. It's not possible.
C: GRAHAM
D: Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's not just possible, it's probably. There's probably millions of intelligent civilizations.
C: RUTH
D: So, where is everybody?
C: GRAHAM
D: Well, one of them is right there. RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window. CLIVE is trying not to laugh.
C: RUTH
D: Everything I've ever been told is a lie. My purpose. My truth. All false. DO you know how that feels? To suddenly have nothing?
C: GRAHAM
D: Just because your truth wasn't the truth, it doesn't mean there is no truth, Ruth.
C: RUTH
D: Huh?
C: GRAHAM
D: I understand you're probably feeling very confused right now. Religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security. To stop us feeling lonely and unimportant.
C: RUTH
D: I do feel lonely and unimportant! How can this all be an accident? It doesn't make sense. Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth? GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.
C: RUTH
D: How can that be an accident.
C: GRAHAM
D: It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it probably is. That's the beauty of the universe.
C: RUTH
D: But what's the point? If there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living?
C: GRAHAM
D: This is the point, Ruth. Right now. This conversation. That tree, your next cheeseburger. Life is a miracle. People spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess, they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon.
C: RUTH
D: Huh?
C: GRAHAM
D: Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.'
C: RUTH
D: Huh?
C: GRAHAM
D: It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn. We still have life to live.
C: RUTH
D: I'm frightened.
C: GRAHAM
D: So am I, but it passes, sort of. Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure and I think you should come with us. I know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that RV, you might just find the very thing you're looking for.
C: RUTH
D: I... I'm not sure.
C: GRAHAM
D: I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I can honestly say, I have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing.
C: RUTH
D: That's so sweet. GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.
S: INT. RV - DAY
N: GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased with himself.
C: GRAHAM
D: She's going to be fine. I think your hair looks good by the way. You look like Storm.
C: RUTH
D: Who's Storm?
C: PAUL
D: From X-Men.
C: GRAHAM
D: Exactly. RUTH goes to the bathroom.
N: RUTH (O.S.) AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR!
S: EXT/INT. RV - DAY
N: The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations. GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back. CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns round, she looks away. PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.
C: CLIVE
D: Small corrections! Small corrections! RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.
S: EXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY
N: We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up suddenly, looking rattled.
S: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
N: The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads "LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL leaps back and forth over the line.
C: PAUL
D: 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on! It's fun. We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the road watching PAUL.
C: RUTH
D: This is the furthest I've ever been.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: ZOIL's convoy pulls into an Arby's. The three AGENTS leap out of their cars and run in. After a short pause MOSES BEHE's pick up truck passes through shout; "Onward Christian Soldiers' blares from the radio.
S: INT. RV - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.
C: RUTH
D: You don't mind, do you, Graham?
C: GRAHAM
D: It looks nice.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, we should stop for something to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?
C: RUTH
D: What?
C: CLIVE
D: I'm hungry.
C: PAUL
D: What's new, fatty?
C: CLIVE
D: Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I happen to be very strong. PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits it onto the floor of the RV.
C: PAUL
D: Pick that up then.
C: CLIVE
D: So childish.
C: RUTH
D: Maybe I should call Papa.
C: PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE
D: What?!
C: RUTH
D: Look, I've been missing for a whole day. If he's called the police, they'll be looking for us and if they find us, this "amazing adventure' is going to come to an end real quick. I just need to tell him I'm fine and that I'll be back soon, okay? PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.
C: PAUL
D: Right up top! RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.
C: PAUL
D: Too soon? CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.
C: CLIVE
D: I did it!
S: EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.
C: CLIVE
D: Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk to anyone unless you have to and try to look inconspicuous. Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.
N: HOOOOOOOONNNK.
C: CLIVE
D: I wish he'd stop doing that! They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.
S: INT. BAR - NIGHT
N: The bar is very busy. Scantily clad waitresses serve a variety of customers. People play pool, other people dance to a small band. RUTH spies a pay phone at the back.
C: RUTH
D: I won't be long.
C: CLIVE
D: We'll order food and wait for you at the bar.
C: RUTH
D: Okay.
C: CLIVE
D: Be careful. RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Tap water.
S: INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER
N: RUTH dials. She listens nervously. Click.
C: OPERATOR
D: Ruth Behe?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Yes?
C: OPERATOR
D: Please hold, your call is being diverted.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Wait, I...
C: ZOIL
D: Ruth Behe?
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: Yes?
C: ZOIL
D: Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen very carefully. You're in great danger.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: How did you...?
C: ZOIL
D: We know who you're travelling with Ruth. I need you and your friend to turn yourselves in.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: What if we don't want to turn ourselves in?
S: INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop nearby. O'REILLY listens in.
C: ZOIL
D: Where are you? Where are you headed?
C: RUTH
D: I don't know.
E: O.S.
C: ZOIL
D: Look, I know you think you're doing the right thing but I promise you, I'm only thinking about you. And Paul. You care about Paul, don't you?
C: RUTH
D: I don't know how I feel about him. He's weird and also, rude.
E: O.S.
C: ZOIL
D: Yes he is.
C: RUTH
D: I asked him why he wore shorts and he said if he didn't I'd see his big spaceman balls.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT
N: Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL.
C: RUTH
D: Who's there with you?
C: ZOIL
D: Ruth, please listen to me. Your father is worried about you. We want to get you home. I need you to tell me where you are.
E: O.S.
C: RUTH
D: He showed me things.
C: ZOIL
D: You're not still talking about his balls, are you?
C: RUTH
D: I... i just want to know what's real. I'm confused. I... I... RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.
N: HAGGARD (O.S.) WE GOT HER!
C: ZOIL
D: Damnit, Haggard! RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused.
E: O.S.
C: JAKE
D: Hey, slow down there cyclops.
C: RUTH
D: I need to get to my friends.
C: GUS
D: Why the hurry? You know I got a friend with one eye who'd love to meet you.
C: RUTH
D: I happen to have two eyes actually. I just have a severe stigmatism.
C: JAKE
D: You should get that fixed up. Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the right light.
C: GUS
D: Yeah, the dark.
C: RUTH
D: Papa said the Lord would fix it.
C: GUS
D: The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing sweetheart.
C: RUTH
D: No shit. RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts.
S: INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food, RUTH returns from the Phone.
C: GRAHAM
D: How's your dad?
C: RUTH
D: We need to leave now.
C: CLIVE
D: We're still waiting on a wet fries. The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.
C: JAKE
D: Holy shit! It's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile!
C: CLIVE
D: Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps we can exchange insurance details?
C: JAKE
D: I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.
C: GUS
D: These the "friends' you told us about, baby?
C: RUTH
D: Yes, they are.
C: JAKE
D: Well whaddya know? Small world.
C: RUTH
D: We were just leaving.
C: GUS
D: I don't think so.
N: JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.
C: GRAHAM
D: Leave her alone!
C: JAKE
D: What did you say?
C: CLIVE
D: He said, leave her alone. At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and comes face to face with her father.
E: timid but resolute
N: MOSES BEHE RUTH?! RUTH PAPA?!
C: CLIVE
D: Graham?
C: MOSES BEHE
D: I'm taking you home.
C: RUTH
D: I... I can't.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Don't talk back to me, girl!
N: RUTH
C: PAPA I-
D: A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.
S: EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.
C: RUTH
D: What about Papa?!
C: JAKE
D: Hey, we ain't finished with you.
C: CLIVE
D: Graham, take Ruth into the RV and lock the door. I don't want either of you to see this. CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in the face, he falls, nose bleeding. They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL stands silhouetted against the interior lights.
C: PAUL
D: Yo fucknuts! The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few feet from them, their eyes bulge.
C: PAUL
D: So, who wants to get probed first? The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.
C: GRAHAM
D: Ha! Only one of us fainted!
C: PAUL
D: Tell me you got the food? CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food. Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.
C: RUTH
D: It's them.
C: GRAHAM
D: Who?
C: RUTH
D: It wasn't my fault. They answered the phone. He knew all about us.
C: CLIVE
D: Who? Who are you talking about?
C: PAUL
D: Get in the RV! SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night, leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.
S: INT. RV - NIGHT
N: The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang sit in silence for a while.
C: GRAHAM
D: Was that your dad, Ruth? RUTH nods.
C: CLIVE
D: He was so angry.
C: RUTH
D: He's always angry. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.
C: GRAHAM
D: Are you alright, Ruth? RUTH nods, still distant.
C: PAUL
D: I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone wanna take a walk?
C: CLIVE
D: I'm game.
C: GRAHAM
D: You want to come for a walk, Ruth?
C: RUTH
D: Thanks, but I think I'm going to turn in. It's been a long day what with meeting you guys, being abducted by and alien and having my whole belief system called into question.
C: PAUL
D: Sorry about that.
C: GRAHAM
D: It was amazing though, wasn't it? Remember when Paul said "Yo fucknuts'? That was brilliant.
C: PAUL
D: You gotta talk the talk, right?
C: CLIVE
D: What about when I got smacked in the nose?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You want anything Ruth?
C: RUTH
D: No, you go, I'll be fine. Here Clive. RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the words "JESUS SAVES'.
C: CLIVE
D: Thank you. He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.
C: GRAHAM
D: You can sleep in my bunk if you'd like. She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.
C: GRAHAM
D: I'd use a pen to push the tissues off the bed. I've had a cold.
S: EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing store. PAUL looks in the window.
C: PAUL
D: Hey Graham. Check this out. What d'ya think? PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a child, displayed in the window.
C: PAUL
D: I'd look pretty hot, right?
C: GRAHAM
D: Space cowboy.
C: PAUL
D: Steve Miller Band. I love that song. Speaking of midnight tokers, I got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants. Do you guys partake?
C: GRAHAM
D: No.
C: PAUL
D: Shame. I get it from the military. This is the shit that killed Dylan.
C: GRAHAM
D: Bob Dylan's still alive.
C: PAUL
D: Is he? CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.
C: CLIVE
D: Let's party!
S: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
N: GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.
C: GRAHAM
D: So why "Paul'? It's not very, you know, alien.
C: CLIVE
D: Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something?
C: PAUL
D: No.
C: GRAHAM
D: P-o-o-u-r-l?
C: PAUL
D: No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel.
C: CLIVE
D: Paul Simon.
C: PAUL
D: Paul Simon. Paul's not my real name. It's a name I got given.
C: GRAHAM
D: What's your real name?
C: PAUL
D: You won't be able to pronounce it.
C: CLIVE
D: I can speak Klingon.
C: PAUL
D: What a geek.
C: CLIVE
D: Hey!
C: GRAHAM
D: Come on, what's your real name. PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.
C: PAUL
D: Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.
C: CLIVE
D: Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.
C: PAUL
D: That's pretty good.
C: GRAHAM
D: Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.
C: PAUL
D: Fuck you!
C: CLIVE
D: Calm down, Rog. More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.
C: GRAHAM
D: You look like a poster on a student's wall.
C: PAUL
D: That was my gag! "Take me to your dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine. Never saw a dime.
C: GRAHAM
D: You never answered my question. Why Paul? Who called you Paul?
C: PAUL
D: The little girl who found me when I crashed. It was terrible actually. I killed her dog. I didn't mean to! My ship sort of landed on it. When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying "Paul? Paul?" It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over. Spooks thought it was my name.
C: CLIVE
D: She called her dog Paul?
C: PAUL
D: Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.
C: GRAHAM
D: What happened to the little girl?
C: PAUL
D: Who knows? Never saw her again. Think about her everyday though. PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though governed by some kind of psychic link.
C: CLIVE
D: It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily in this situation Graham and I would be looking up at the stars, wondering about life on other planets but we know now, don't we? It's a bit of an anti-climax.
C: PAUL
D: Thanks a bunch, Hurley.
C: CLIVE
D: I don't mean that in a bad way. They all scratch their noses.
C: GRAHAM
D: Paul, can I ask you something?
C: PAUL
D: Shoot.
C: GRAHAM
D: Why are you in such a hurry to leave?
C: PAUL
D: I've outlived my usefulness.
C: CLIVE
D: How so?
C: PAUL
D: There's only so much knowledge I can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich. The only thing I have to offer them now are my abilities.
C: GRAHAM
D: So?
C: PAUL
D: So the only way they're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells.
C: GRAHAM
D: So what, do they take a swab from your cheek?
C: PAUL
D: Negative.
C: CLIVE
D: Stool?
C: PAUL
D: Sadly, not that simple.
C: GRAHAM
D: Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.
C: PAUL
D: Believe me, a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me.
C: CLIVE
D: I don't follow.
C: PAUL
D: Stem cells are multipotent. GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.
C: PAUL
D: Lineage defined? GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.
C: PAUL
D: The camouflage response, the memory transfer, the revivification, they all originate in my cerebellum. In order to cultivate them in a laboratory they would have to...
E: CONT'D
C: GRAHAM/CLIVE
D: Cut your brain out.
C: PAUL
D: Bingo! Fortunately, someone was kind enough to give me the heads up, if you'll pardon the pun. So, when they were transferring me to the medical facility and I noticed the bumper sticker on your RV, I figured you might be sympathetic types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed the wheel and took my chance.
C: CLIVE
D: I thought the crash was our fault.
C: PAUL
D: Well it was, kinda.
C: GRAHAM
D: So, you're saying if they catch you... PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.
C: PAUL
D: So tell me, are you guys virgins or what?
C: GRAHAM/CLIVE
D: No. They all cough.
C: PAUL
D: Alright then, Clive, when was the last time you got laid.
C: CLIVE
D: Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.
C: PAUL
D: Three years ago you had sex with a midget?
C: CLIVE
D: She was an Ewok! Sniff.
C: PAUL
D: There are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an Ewok costume.
C: CLIVE
D: She was a midget.
C: PAUL
D: I can't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature.
C: CLIVE
D: I know. I'm sorry.
C: PAUL
D: Was it nice?
N: CLIVE WONDERFUL
C: PAUL
D: You sly dog! PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.
S: EXT. WOODS - MORNING
N: The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white. His eyes open. He looks around.
C: PAUL
D: Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We fell asleep.
C: CLIVE
D: How did that happen?
C: PAUL
D: Sorry, I get this thing when I get high. It's called "projective empathy'. You feel what I feel.
C: GRAHAM
D: Like in E.T.?
C: PAUL
D: Exactly.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh, thank God. For a second there I thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer. The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood. Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet town of last night has become very busy indeed.
C: GRAHAM
D: Oh dear!
C: PAUL
D: I can't walk through there.
C: CLIVE
D: How are we going to get back? Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.
S: EXT. TOWN - DAY
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.
C: GRAHAM
D: Maybe we should hold hands, so that we look like a family.
C: PAUL
D: That's great! Two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy.
C: CLIVE
D: You could be a midget.
C: PAUL
D: You're obsessed with midgets! They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.
C: GRAHAM
D: Seem to be working, Clive. Clive? GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con. The tag reads "Genuine "BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.
C: GRAHAM
D: Clive, no. CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road, scanning the passers by.
S: INT. COMIC SHOP - DAY
N: GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.
C: GRAHAM
D: Now's not really the time, Sausage.
C: CLIVE
D: I must have it.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's very cheap. Are you sure you don't want to save up and get a proper on?
C: CLIVE
D: Oh, come on, we've got time.
S: INT/EXT. RV - DAY
N: Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried. KNOCK KNOCK.
C: RUTH
D: Where have you been? I was worried. She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.
C: ZOIL
D: Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle we're currently looking for. May I ask, are you alone? RUTH pauses a second.
C: RUTH
D: Yes, I'm alone.
C: ZOIL
D: Do you mind taking a look at these pictures? ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.
C: ZOIL
D: Do you recognise any of these people, Miss? She lingers on the picture of herself.
C: ZOIL
D: Miss?
C: RUTH
D: No, sorry I don't.
C: ZOIL
D: Where are you coming from, Ma'am?
C: RUTH
D: Christian ministry in Seattle. I've been driving for 5 days.
C: ZOIL
D: Going far?
C: RUTH
D: Austin.
C: ZOIL
D: Great town.
C: RUTH
D: Oh yes. It has an impressive bat population you know?
N: (MORE)
C: RUTH
D: Folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out. Turn the sky black. Quite a sight.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOIL
D: Is that so?
C: RUTH
D: Uh-huh. Well, I really should be getting along.
C: ZOIL
D: Of course. Thanks for your time, Miss...? Beat.
C: RUTH
D: Darwin, Charlotte Darwin. ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.
S: INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
N: GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot like him. The comic is called "Encounter Briefs: Tales From the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8) small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the cover of the comic and back at PAUL.
C: PAUL
D: How's it going?
C: CHILD
D: Is that you?
C: PAUL
D: No.
C: CHILD
D: It looks like you.
C: PAUL
D: Suppose it does. What's your name?
C: CHILD
D: Keith Nash.
C: PAUL
D: I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you. They shake hands.
C: PAUL
D: You on your own here, Keith Nash?
C: KEITH NASH
D: My Mom's shopping for some new jeans. She lets me wait in here.
C: PAUL
D: Sounds like a good Mum.
C: KEITH NASH
D: Yes and no. What're you doing here?
C: PAUL
D: My friend's buying a sword. He's a grown man.
C: KEITH NASH
D: What a nerd. PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.
C: PAUL
D: You an M&Ms man, Keith? PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.
C: KEITH NASH
D: I am but I shouldn't.
C: PAUL
D: Strangers with candy, right?
C: KEITH NASH
D: Right.
C: PAUL
D: Well, we've got a lot in common. We both like comics and M&Ms. Guess that makes us pals.
C: KEITH NASH
D: Guess so. KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out called "G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.
C: PAUL
D: You read this one?
C: KEITH NASH
D: No.
C: PAUL
D: It's a good one. Take it. Go on. It's a gift.
C: KEITH NASH
D: Thanks Paul.
N: KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS. NASH calling from the street.
C: KEITH NASH
D: I gotta go.
C: PAUL
D: Catch you later, Keith Nash. GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box under his arm and a big grin on his face.
C: CLIVE
D: Who was that?
C: PAUL
D: Keith Nash. How much was that?
C: CLIVE
D: $299.99. It's made of a low grade Turkish alloy.
C: PAUL
D: What did you get, speccy?
C: GRAHAM
D: X-Men action figure.
C: PAUL
D: Jesus Cheeeerist.
S: EXT. COMIC SHOP - DAY
N: GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.
C: MRS. NASH
D: Don't lie, Keith.
C: KEITH NASH
D: I'm not lying.
C: MRS. NASH
D: Oh, come on now, Keith. If you carry on like this, you'll have to come with me to Dress Barn.
C: KEITH NASH
D: Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and his name was Paul!
C: MRS. NASH
D: Whoever hard of an alien called Paul?
N: HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY stands nearby.
C: HAGGARD
D: What did you say, kid?
C: MRS. NASH
D: Excuse me. Who are you?
C: HAGGARD
D: Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret Service.
C: MRS. NASH
D: Secret Service?!
C: HAGGARD
D: Kid?
C: KEITH NASH
D: He was in the shop.
C: HAGGARD
D: Is he still in there? KEITH shakes his head.
C: O'REILLY
D: Did he say where he was going? KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in the entirely wrong direction.
C: HAGGARD
D: South. Toward New Mexico, huh? KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.
C: O'REILLY
D: We've got him man! We're going to get a fucking promotion.
C: HAGGARD
D: You did good kid. Want a candy?
C: KEITH NASH
D: No thanks.
C: HAGGARD
D: Let's go. The two agents rush off.
C: O'REILLY
D: What about Zoil?
C: HAGGARD
D: Screw Zoil!
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.
C: ZOIL
D: Where the hell do you think you're going? HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.
E: O.S.
C: HAGGARD
D: We picked up a lead, sir. Little kid in the town said he saw an alien. Said he was heading toward New Mexico.
C: ZOIL
D: And you were just gonna take off?
C: HAGGARD
D: Thought it best to take the initiative, sir. We were going to radio you.
C: ZOIL
D: Well now, that's mighty civil of you. We have a chain of command. I expect you to abide by it. Where d'you say he was headed?
C: HAGGARD
D: New Mexico sir.
C: ZOIL
D: Well, then let's move it. They scramble.
C: ZOIL
D: Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting ideas about your station again. ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.
S: INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY
N: MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner.
C: VOICE
D: Zoil, what the hell's going on?
E: O.S.
C: ZOIL
D: They've double back sir. They're heading toward New Mexico.
E: O.S.
C: VOICE
D: You better be right about this, Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of this shit. I want that little fucker's brain in a jar by sundown. MOSES smiles darkly.
E: O.S.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Looks like you're going the wrong way, Agent Zoil. That's what happens when you don't got the Lord on your side.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign.
S: INT. RV - DAYBREAK
N: The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her.
C: PAUL
D: He likes you, y'know?
C: RUTH
D: Graham? D'you think?
C: PAUL
D: What are you, blind? Beat.
C: PAUL
D: Sorry. Beat.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: What you got there, a stigmatism?
N: RUTH nods.
C: PAUL
D: You know you can get on operation for that, right?
C: RUTH
D: Papa said the Lord would fix it. Guess that's not gonna happen, seeing as we're living in a gigantic godless universe, with no hope of salvation.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, I don't know categorically that it's godless. I just said "probably'.
C: RUTH
D: Oh, that's a relief.
C: PAUL
D: Look, the way you're feeling now, that's why religion appeared in the first place. It's like existential Prozac. Imagine being five year sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for. That's how it is for much of humanity. Faith is a night- light. It illuminates the scary corners, fills the gaps, makes the universe easier to comprehend. Thing is, it's okay not to know everything. I mean, who knows what's really out there? Did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter?
C: RUTH
D: Yes.
C: PAUL
D: Oh. Well, then you get it, right? If they have the theory, who's to say at some point in the future they won't put it into practice and who's to say someone else didn't do that 13.5 Billion years ago and that's how the universe came to be? Course, then we get the eternal problem of who created the creator but that's a whole other car park. I think Shakespeare said it best. "There's more in Heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy Horatio".
C: RUTH
D: What did you call me?
C: PAUL
D: Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You know, the Prince of Denmark?
C: RUTH
D: Denmark has a municipal population of 508,691. PAUL blinks.
C: PAUL
D: Anyway, if there is a God, didn't he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't have to go round fixing people's lazy eyeballs?
C: RUTH
D: I suppose so.
C: PAUL
D: The eye is a delicate and complex thing, Ruth. You should get it taken care of. RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window, just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.
C: RUTH
D: They're back. PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard.
C: PAUL
D: Perfect.
C: CLIVE
D: What are you going to do with this?
C: PAUL
D: Phone home.
S: INT. ZOIL'S CAR - DAY

C: ZOIL
D: It wasn't going to New Mexico?
C: VOICE
D: That's a three pointer Agent Zoil. You better spin your ass around. You got some serious catching up to do. Don't make me come out there.
C: ZOIL
D: No, sir. Where are they headed? If we gun it, maybe we can get the drop on their destination.
C: VOICE
D: They're on the 50, heading towards Gillette.

C: GRAHAM
D: You don't think she's still there do you?
C: PAUL
D: That's what you're going to find out for me.
C: CLIVE
D: Us?
C: PAUL
D: I can't just knock can I? What if she's moved on and someone else answers? I'm sick of people fainting on me. I'll hang back with my buddy Ruth, you two make first contact. Just enjoy it.
C: CLIVE
D: What shall we say if it's her? We're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago?
C: PAUL
D: Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes.

D: Leave me alone!
E: O.S.
C: GRAHAM
D: Okay. GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.
C: CLIVE
D: Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive Gollings and this is my friend and colleague, Graham Willy. We're from England and we're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago. Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to reveal a woman . Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.
E: 68
C: TARA
D: What is this, some kind of joke?
C: CLIVE
D: It's no joke. PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.
C: PAUL
D: Hello Tara. TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.
C: PAUL
D: Aw nuts.
S: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY
N: GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits opposite, staring at PAUL.
C: RUTH
D: Maybe I should make some tea.
C: TARA
D: Where are my manners? I never really have guests. Nobody comes up here. I go whole weeks without seeing a soul.
N: TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match. PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.
C: PAUL
D: Can I do anything to help? TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand. PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.
C: TARA
D: I've only just stopped believing in you, y'know? Spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night. My parents, my friends. Everyone thought I was mad. They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul. Took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation. They said I was concussed, hallucinating, but I knew you were real. I pulled you from that spaceship myself. Sat with you till the men came and took you away. If Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he would have seen you too. They kept telling me I'd imagined it but I knew different. Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with "delayed this' and "post- traumatic that'. He just used to smile and say "there, there Tara'. He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later. I inherited this place. Word got out about my story not long after it happened, so I didn't really have any friends. Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names. I just kinda retreated into myself. I'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again. I always believed that one day you"d come back and here you are. The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.
C: TARA
D: Listen to me gabbing. Milk and sugar?
C: PAUL
D: I'm so sorry.
C: TARA
D: What for?
C: PAUL
D: For killing your dog and ruining your life.
C: TARA
D: That doesn't matter. Don't you see? You're real. I was right and all those folk that said I was crazy? Well, they can all go fuck themselves.
C: PAUL
D: It's good to see you, Tara. The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.
C: TARA
D: Now, where do you suppose that came from?
C: PAUL
D: Fuck a duck! Get out!
C: GRAHAM/CLIVE
D: Shit!
C: PAUL
D: Tara, where's the back door?

D: In back. The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask.
S: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY
N: The gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and continue on toward the back of the house. They find the back door, just as it is opened by ZOIL. The gang freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears right next to ZOIL, putting his hand across ZOIL's forehead.

C: PAUL
D: Clive?
C: CLIVE
D: Yes?

D: A little help?
N: CLIVE picks PAUL up. HAGGARD approaches, gun drawn.

D: Godammit Haggard!
S: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. CELLAR - DAY

S: INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

C: GRAHAM
D: Punch it!
N: The RV roars into life, reversing out onto the road. CLIVE pulls a spectacular U-turn, sending the passengers flying. GRAHAM lands in TARA's arms, RUTH in PAUL's. RUTH and GRAHAM exchange glances. Dumb luck. TARA straightens herself and looks out of the RV at her destroyed home.
C: TARA
D: My weed!
S: EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY
N: ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder. His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD drops ZOIL and runs to his car.
C: ZOIL
D: Damnit Haggard, wait! HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder.
S: INT. RV - DAY
N: CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black.
C: GRAHAM
D: Your dad's persistent, isn't he?

D: What do we do?
C: PAUL
D: Go left.

S: INT. RV - EVENING
C: CLIVE
D: What are we doing exactly?
N: PAUL (TO HIMSELF) Immense pressure and temperature drop. High winds, circulating in the troposphere, two opposed fronts clashing. Oh, this is going to be a good one. CLIVE
C: A GOOD WHAT?!
D: RUTH stares out of the window.
C: RUTH
D: Oh my God.
S: EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

D: Paul, we'll get sucked right up.

C: CLIVE
D: Paul!
C: PAUL
D: Stay on target.
S: EXT. SCRUB - EVENING
N: The grain silo bounces close to ZOIL's car, he swerves to avoid it and stops. MOSES pulls up just ahead. MOSES and ZOIL get out of the vehicles, almost unable to stand against the wind and debris. They watch the RV, now a good distance in front, heading for the heart of the tornado.
C: ZOIL
D: He's insane!
N: MOSES BEHE
C: RUTH!
D: HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio.

C: PAUL
D: Back where I'm from, tornadoes are part of our daily life. We've learnt how to live with them, how to understand them.
C: CLIVE
D: They're gaining!
C: PAUL
D: We've learnt to anticipate their behavior, know their personalities, know when they're playing games.
N: RUTH
C: GRAHAM
D: What games?
N: RUTH
C: PAUL
D: Hide and seek?
N: RUTH CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD.

C: GRAHAM
D: Sorry.
C: RUTH
D: Wait, what about Papa?
C: CLIVE
D: I only saw one car following us.
C: PAUL
D: Where's Tara? TARA comes out of the toilet.
C: TARA
D: The bulb's gone in there.
C: GRAHAM
D: That was just awesome. Amazing driving Clive. It was like G.T.A. but potentially fatal. Wasn't it, Clive? Clive? A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.
C: CLIVE
D: Oh no.
S: EXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING
N: The RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the grill, reveals the cause of her downfall.
C: GRAHAM
D: There goes the deposit.
C: CLIVE
D: Fare thee well friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed.
C: TARA
D: She rode that storm with a bullet in her heart and didn't stop until we we're safe.
C: RUTH
D: If there is a benevolent creator watching over everything then may he, she or it bless the 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there.
C: GRAHAM
D: Paul?
C: PAUL
D: We're here. PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill. He starts to climb. The others follow. Crane up as TEAM PAUL climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has seen Close Encounters Of The Third Kind... DEVIL's TOWER
E: O.S.
C: GRAHAM/CLIVE
D: Of course!
S: INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING
N: ZOIL drives. Scanning the landscape. Searching.
C: VOICE
D: Zoil! What the hell is going on?
C: ZOIL
D: We got hit by a twister, sir. Haggard's dead.
C: VOICE
D: What about the other one?
C: ZOIL
D: I lost him when the ranch exploded.
C: VOICE
D: Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been one fuck up after another. I should have handled it myself. I want that little bastard dead by midnight tonight or you'll be working security in a convention centre. Now where's that RV? ZOIL's eyes widen. Parked on the roadside is the RV.
C: VOICE
D: Zoil? ZOIL? ZOIL is staring at DEVIL'S TOWER.
S: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER - DAY
N: TEAM PAUL hike towards the tower.
C: RUTH
D: What you may not know is on the outside of the tower they bolted a series of ladders, all the way to the top, put there by William Rogers in 1893. He was the first man to climb the tower.
C: TARA
D: I climbed up there in 1976. Thought it would make a good site for some UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't the only one.
C: PAUL
D: We call them IFOs.
C: TARA
D: Cute.
C: PAUL
D: I-thank-you.
S: EXT. SMALL ROAD - DUSK
N: ZOIL opens the trunk of his car. He pulls out a large piston, spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his shoulder. He sets off up the hill.
S: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT
N: TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.
C: PAUL
D: This is it. PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.
C: PAUL
D: I'll miss these. PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive and bright red, it illuminates the tower.
C: TARA
D: Pretty.
C: GRAHAM
D: What now?
C: PAUL
D: We wait. A light appears in the sky some way off.
N: PAUL (CONT'D) (FROWNING) That was quick.
S: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT
N: ZOIL runs through the bush, fast, like a wild animal. His face fixed with serious intent, gun in one hand, torch in the other.
S: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT
N: TEAM PAUL watch as the ethereal light draws nearer. Spotlights cut through the night, searching beneath.
S: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT
N: ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.
S: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT
N: The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.
C: PAUL
D: Wait a minute... A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by the sight of a torch getting nearer.
C: PAUL
D: Oh shit. Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.
E: CONT'D
C: VOICE
D: Well, whaddya know? Small world. VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts through the trees behind them.
N: ZOIL PAUL!
C: PAUL
D: Lorenzo?! PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes past him, slamming into one of the soldiers. ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward, holding a smoking gun.
C: VOICE
D: It was you! You told him. I should've known.
N: (MORE)
C: VOICE
D: You've never made a mistake in your life. That's why I put you in charge of this fucking mission.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOIL
D: He's my friend! I've known him for twenty years. He introduced me to my wife damnit!
C: VOICE
D: You stupid son of a bitch. In five years, you could have been where I am.
C: ZOIL
D: I don't want to be where you are.
C: VOICE
D: Too bad, seeing as I'm the one hold'ng all the cards and when I say "cards", I of course mean big fucking gun. VOICE points his gun at PAUL.
C: PAUL
D: How'd you find me?
C: VOICE
D: It was pretty easy once we got a fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard to figure out where you were headed. You always did have a flare for the dramatic. PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.
C: VOICE
D: Let's go. TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.
C: CLIVE
D: He's not going anywhere.
C: VOICE
D: Be honest with yourself, two scoops. What is it that you think you can possibly bring to the table at this stage in the game? CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD, he holds it like a proud Samurai.
C: CLIVE
D: Blind fury. The blade falls off.
C: CLIVE
D: Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.
C: VOICE
D: Step aside, you fat nerd.
N: CLIVE (IN KLINGON) Graham, his this man. CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly, blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke. RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.
C: RUTH
D: Leave him alone! VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.
C: GRAHAM
D: Leave her alone! VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.
C: TARA
D: Leave them alone. WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.
C: TARA
D: You're not taking him away again. He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.
C: PAUL
D: Thank you, Tara.
C: TARA
D: Don't mention it. PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.
C: ZOIL
D: The things I do for you, huh?
C: PAUL
D: You know I appreciate it.
C: ZOIL
D: Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch you guys?
N: PAUL (LAUGHS) Let me take a look at that. Ruth, shine the torch down here? RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL. BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white, his eyes wide.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.
C: GRAHAM
D: Noooooooooo! GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of blood around her mouth.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: I...I never meant to shoot her. I was aiming for the goblin.
C: CLIVE
D: He's not a goblin he's from another planet.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: But he can't be. He... he...
C: GRAHAM
D: He's an alien you stupid man! Oh Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I should have never persuaded you to come with us. RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.
C: RUTH
D: What, and miss all this? Graham, I've lived more in the last 48 hours that I ever did in that trailer park. Isn't that what you said living was all about? Right now? This conversation? That tree? My next cheeseburger? I'm not afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold though. Hey, where is everybody? RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL, silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.
C: PAUL
D: There is no way this thing isn't gonna end happy.
N: PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest. MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Get away from her! Don't you touch my little girl. CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums, charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks both shining, healthy eyes.
C: GRAHAM
D: Ruth, are you okay?
C: RUTH
D: I think so. Is anyone hungry? I really feel like a cheese burger. Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up to see PAUL.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: Thank you. RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.
C: RUTH
D: You can kiss me now. They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.
C: PAUL
D: Looks like the geek shall inherit the earth.
C: CLICK CLICK.
D: The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.
C: VOICE
D: I wouldn't say-
C: SPLAT.
D: A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.
C: PAUL
D: Happens to the best of us.
S: EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT
N: Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now present. One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking their hands. The atmosphere is amiable. TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.
C: PAUL
D: I'm sorry I frightened you so much your hair turned white.
C: RUTH
D: You didn't frighten me. You freed me. You helped me see the light.
N: PAUL (TO MOSES) Take care of her big man.
C: MOSES BEHE
D: I will sir. God be with you.
C: PAUL
D: Whatever dude. They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a makeshift sling and shakes his hand.
C: PAUL
D: Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man. Say bye to Karen for me.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOIL
D: Safe trip Short Round. PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.
C: CLIVE
D: You can keep it.
C: PAUL
D: Cool. Okay.
C: GRAHAM
D: What did you think?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although you know what? Sometimes, less is more. The boys nod.
C: PAUL
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D
C: GRAHAM
D: No, thank you.
C: CLIVE
D: You are, and always will be, our friend.
C: PAUL
D: Come here you fucking geeks. They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.
C: PAUL
D: This is a self-sustaining light orb. Might come in handy, you know, if a bulb goes. TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: You coming?
E: CONT'D
C: TARA
D: What?
C: PAUL
D: I ruined your life Tara. Think I owe you a new one. TARA takes PAUL's hand.
C: TARA
D: I don't have my toothbrush.
C: PAUL
D: Baby, where we're going, you won't need teeth. TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue. Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE. As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh, tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.
C: GRAHAM
D: That was good, wasn't it?
S: INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY
N: We are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a long line of people. Sat behind a table are GRAHAM and CLIVE. They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short woman in an EWOK costume. He pats her on the ass as she walks away. All around them are stacks of their new novel: PAUL. A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own rendering of their alien friend. They sign copies. The PUBLICIST mills around, looking very pleased.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Just one item per person please. He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is dressed as Storm from X-Men and pushes a customized buggy, in which sits a baby dressed as Professor X.
C: RUTH
D: Hey.
C: GRAHAM
D: Hey babe. You okay?
C: RUTH
D: I'm just taking Tara over to the autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's here!
C: CLIVE
