C: SCOTT
D: Hey... Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:
E: O.S.
N: "SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME." Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera. INTEGRATED FINAL 2A.

N: Back in the kitchen, everyone looks at Scott...
C: KIM PINE

C: STEPHEN STILLS

D: You promise to be good?
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Of course I'll be good!
C: SCOTT

S: INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY

C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Wow.
C: SCOTT
D: Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat. Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Hi, sorry, what was your name?
C: KIM PINE
D: Kim.

C: SCOTT
D: Knives, that's Young Neil.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Hi. What do you play?
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: Uh, wow...Zelda...Tetris...that's kind of a big question. Knives stares blankly at Young Neil, who finally gets it.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: Oh. I'm not in the band. I just live here. Sex Bob-Omb has geared up. Amps hum to life.
C: SCOTT
D: Let's start with Launchpad McQuack.

SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD TITLES continue over the song as the small rehearsal space seems to GROW with the music. Stephen Stills barks unintelligable lyrics. Knives watches, jaw ajar.

N: INTEGRATED FINAL 6.
C: STEPHEN STILLS

C: SCOTT
D: Neil, you were saying she seems awesome.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: Yeah, she seems awesome.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeaaaah...
S: INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING
N: Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal. "WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"
C: SCOTT
D: Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17 year old. Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.
C: WALLACE
D: Is he cute?
C: SCOTT
D: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
C: WALLACE
D: Does this mean we have to stop sleeping together?
C: SCOTT
D: Do you see another bed in here? TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included.
C: WALLACE
D: Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.
C: SCOTT
D: So. The whole seventeen year old thing. Don't tell too many people.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 6A.
C: WALLACE
D: Hey, you know me.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 7.
C: SCOTT
D: I mean. Don't tell my sister.
C: WALLACE
D: You know me. Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting.
C: SCOTT
D: Who are you texting? RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.
C: STACEY
D: Seventeen years old? Scandal! Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'If you are using your cellphone, you will not be served'.
E: O.S.
N: "STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN."
C: SCOTT
D: That's not true. Who told you?
C: STACEY
D: Wallace. Duh.
C: SCOTT
D: That gossipy bitch.
C: WALLACE
D: You know me. Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless.
E: O.S.
C: SCOTT
D: Wallace! Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.
C: STACEY
D: Who is this mysterious child you date?
C: SCOTT
D: Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.
C: STACEY
D: A seventeen year old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.
C: SCOTT
D: It's a Catholic school too.
C: STACEY
D: With the uniform and everything?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 8.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, the whole deal.
C: STACEY
D: Oh my God, you haven't-
C: SCOTT
D: No no no. We haven't even held hands. I think she hugged me once.
C: STACEY
D: Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?
C: SCOTT
D: I don't know...it's just nice, you know? It's just...simple.
C: STACEY
D: It's been over a year since you got dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named. Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine, looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.
C: STACEY
D: So, are you legitimately moving on, or is this just you being insane? Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next to a hot redhead in happier times.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Can I get back to you on that? A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...
S: EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY
N: Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL. Uniformed boys and girls pour out.
C: WALLACE
D: I do not want to be here. At all.
C: SCOTT
D: This school has boys too.
C: WALLACE
D: I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a seventeen year old.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating, more like...
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 8A.
C: WALLACE
D: Playtime?
C: SCOTT
D: That doesn't sound so good either.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 9.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Scott! Heyyyy! Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.
E: O.S.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey Knives, this is my cool gay roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in my class is gay?
C: WALLACE
D: Yes. Does he wear glasses?
C: SCOTT
D: Wallace, you go now! Begone! Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.
C: WALLACE
D: You're too good for him. Run.
S: INT. THE ARCADE - DAY
N: Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION). They punch and kick in unison, side by side.
C: SCOTT
D: Did you know the original name of Pac- man was Puck-man? You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize. You know, scratch out the P and turn it into an F or whatever? Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Ohmigod, like...wow.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. Wow. The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8... Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Oh, I got it!

C: SCOTT
D: I thought Derek and Tamara had a mutual like-each-other thing going, what happened?
S: A13 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY A13
N: Scott and Knives shop for T-shirts. Hangers click in time.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I don't listen to much music. I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys ROCK.
C: SCOTT
D: I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. Thank you, Knives.
S: INT. SONIC BOOM (RECORD STORE) - DAY
N: Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, we're already pretty big. But it might be cool if cool people wore our T-shirt. Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs:
N: "JULIE, 22, STILLS' GIRLFRIEND, RATING: WHAT IS HER PROBLEM?"
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Excuse me, do you have anything by 'The Clash At Demonhead'?
C: JULIE
D: Have you tried the section marked 'The Clash At Demonhead'?
C: SCOTT
D: Thank you, Julie.
C: JULIE
D: Are you coming to my party Friday or will you be busy babysitting?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 10A.
C: SCOTT
D: Thank you, Julie.
N: (TO KNIVES) You don't want to listen to her. (MORE) INTEGRATED FINAL 11.
C: SCOTT
D: And you definitely don't want to listen to them. Scott puts The Clash at Demonhead CD back in the rack.
E: CONT'D
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Oh, I heart them so much.
C: SCOTT
D: I hearted them too until they signed to a major label and the singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life. But that's just me.
N: KNIVES CHAU (OBLIVIOUS) Envy Adams is sooo cool. Do you read her blog?
C: SCOTT
D: Sorry, you were saying about me?
S: EXT. SNOWY TORONTO STREET - DAY
N: Scott and Knives amble down a snow covered sidewalk.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I mean, I've...I've never gone out with someone so talented.
C: SCOTT
D: You go out with a lot of guys?
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: ...no.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, so whatever, man!
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I've never even kissed a guy. Knives blushes and looks at the ground. Scott hugs her.
C: SCOTT
D: Me neither.
S: EXT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Scott and Knives walk up to the front of Wallace's apartment.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: So this is your secret lair? Can I come in?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 12.
C: SCOTT
D: My secret lair is one of those 'no girls allowed' deals.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Oh, okay.
C: SCOTT
D: But do you want to see the house where I grew up?
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Sure. They literally walk across the street to a small house.
C: SCOTT
D: Here you go.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Wow.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand...
S: EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - HOTTEST DAY
N: ...Scott wanders alone through a barren land. He falls to his knees next to a lonely cactus.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh God...so...so alone. A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun.
C: MYSTERIOUS GIRL
D: You're not alone. You're just having some idiotic dream.
C: SCOTT
D: Does that mean we can make out? But she's gone...
S: INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - ?
N: ...SCOTT WAKES UP, sitting up in the FUTON.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh God... Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 13.
C: WALLACE
D: What is it, Scott?
C: SCOTT
D: I had this totally weird dream.
C: OTHER VOICE
D: Oh God.
C: WALLACE
D: What is it, Scott? A scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace:
N: "OTHER SCOTT, 22, WALLACE'S BOYFRIEND? FUN FACT: GUY CURIOUS"
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me not interested.
C: SCOTT
D: But there was this girl...
C: WALLACE
D: Girl?
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Was this an Envy related dream?
C: WALLACE
D: We don't use the E-word in this house.
C: SCOTT
D: No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new...
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Yay for that. Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes.
C: WALLACE
D: Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?
C: SCOTT
D: What? It's like, six in the morning. Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room.
C: SCOTT
D: Arrrrgh!
E: CONT'D
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 13A.
S: INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: What's wrong?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 14. Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library. He carries a stack of books for Knives.
C: SCOTT
D: Libraries remind me of grade school.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: That must seem like a reeeeally long time ago.
C: SCOTT
D: Uh. Let's talk about something else. The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Do you know that girl? The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Scott? Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl.
N: STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.) SCOTT!
S: INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING
N: Scott stands in the rehearsal room, head still in the clouds.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: You only played one note for that entire song.
C: SCOTT
D: It was...uh...my hand slipped.
C: KIM PINE
D: Is your girlfriend distracting you?
C: SCOTT
D: My girlfriend? A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I'll... I'll be quieter.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Let's do that one again.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 15.
C: SCOTT
D: Sorry, what are we doing?
S: EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: I told you like fifty times! Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an icy Toronto street. Scott's head is still in the clouds.
C: KIM PINE
D: We're going to this party, retard.
C: SCOTT
D: Party?
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: At Julie's.
C: SCOTT
D: Ugh. I thought you guys split.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: We did. But, you know, there may be some label guys there, so...
C: SCOTT
D: Aw, man. This is going to suck.
C: KIM PINE
D: At least it will give us something to complain about.
C: SCOTT
D: Awww maaan...
S: INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A bored Scott stands next to Young Neil in a very crowded house party. Both have red plastic cups in hand.
C: SCOTT
D: ...this sucks.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: Sucks.
C: SCOTT
D: I'm going to go pee due to boredom. Scott exits frame.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: I have to pee.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 15A. Neil sips his drink. Scott passes by COMEAU, a bespectacled hipster geek: 'COMEAU, 25, FUN FACT: KNOWS EVERYONE (INCLUDING YOU)'
C: SCOTT
D: Hey Comeau.
C: COMEAU
D: Hey Scott. Some party huh? You gettin' your drink on?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 16.
C: SCOTT
D: This is Coke Zero. I don't drink.
C: COMEAU
D: You don't drink? I remember you getting ridiculously drunk off two G&T's one time and-
N: SCOTT (QUICKLY) Comeau, you know everyone, right?
C: COMEAU
D: Pretty much.
C: SCOTT
D: Do you know this one girl with hair like this? Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona.
C: COMEAU
D: Yeah man. Ramona Flowers. Someone said she was coming tonight actually.
N: SCOTT WHAT?
C: COMEAU
D: You got the hots for her? I hear she's hardcore... Scott has already left a Scott-shaped dust cloud...
S: INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Scott scans the party. His eyes go WIDE. He CRUSHES his plastic cup. There she is...playing the wall...RAMONA! Aloof. Enigmatic. Hot. Scott sidles up and stands next to her.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, what's up?
C: RAMONA
D: Nothing.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, you know Pacman?
C: RAMONA
D: I know of him. Scott begins to babble.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 17.
C: SCOTT
D: Well you know Pac-Man was originally Puckman but not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck and paku-paku-paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it because if you scratch out the "P" and turn it into an "F'? You know? Like...
C: RAMONA
D: Yeah that's amazing.
C: SCOTT
D: Um...am I dreaming? Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away.
C: SCOTT
D: I'll leave you alone forever now.
E: CONT'D
N: "THEN HE STALKED HER FOR THE REST OF THE PARTY..." Series of quick shots as Scott follows Ramona. He ducks around corners, spies from behind a much bigger dude. Ramona leaves the party. Scott grabs a startled Young Neil. SCOTT DUDE! YOUNG NEIL WHA? SCOTT SHE'S TOTALLY REAL! YOUNG NEIL WHO!? STEPHEN STILLS RAMONA FLOWERS! YOUNG NEIL
C: WHUH?
D: JUMP CUT. Scott RUNS towards Comeau.
C: SCOTT
D: DUDE. What do you know about Ramona Flowers?!

D: I think she has a boyfriend.
C: SANDRA
D: Some guy back in New York.
C: MONIQUE
D: Doesn't she have the most ridiculous name?
C: SANDRA
D: I know. It's so 'Ramona Quimby, Aged 8' and yet...Flowers. The girls laugh. Scott does not.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. What else? JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyone
N: ABOUT RAMONA: PARTYGOER #1 I heard she kicks all kind of ass. PARTYGOER #2 She's on another level. PARTYGOER #3 She's got men dying at her feet. PARTYGOER #4 She's got some battle scars. PARTYGOER #5 Not to be entered into lightly We end on the surly JULIE (the rude clerk) who steps in front of Scott, arms crossed. Stephen Stills is with her.

N: INTEGRATED FINAL 19.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl, she just-

D: Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona. Even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year-
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Hey whoa, whoa. Scott's mourning period is officially over. He's totally dating a high schooler.
C: JULIE
D: Dating a high schooler is the mourning period.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: She's got a point.
C: SCOTT
D: I thought you guys broke up.
C: JULIE
D: I don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party Scott. We all know you're a total lady killer wannabe jerky jerk.
C: SCOTT
D: That's garbage! Completely untrue.
C: JULIE
D: That time with Lisa-
C: SCOTT
D: Misunderstanding.
C: JULIE
D: That time with Hollie-
C: SCOTT
D: Not what it looked like!
C: JULIE

C: WALLACE

N: Scott pees in a state of dreamy reverie. The PEE BAR above his head slowly reduces. He stares at himself in the mirror. Scott exits the bathroom, entering...
S: INT. DREAM HIGH SCHOOL - ?
N: ...a long, empty HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY. Scott's footsteps echo as he moves towards a classroom door with a STAR on it... RAMONA FLOWERS bursts through the door, skating past Scott and down the hall, PACKAGE from AMAZON clutched in her hand.

N: (BEAT) Do you want to go out sometime?
C: RAMONA
D: Um, no, that's okay. You just have to sign for this alright?
C: SCOTT
D: I just woke up, and you were in my dream. I dreamt you were delivering me this package. Is that weird?
C: RAMONA
D: It's not weird at all.
C: SCOTT
D: It's not?
C: RAMONA
D: No, it's just like, you've got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that I like to use. It's like three miles in fifteen seconds.
C: SCOTT
D: Right...
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 27.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't have that in Canada.
C: SCOTT
D: You don't remember me do you? I met you at the party the other day.
C: RAMONA
D: Were you the Pac-Man guy?
C: SCOTT
D: No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy. You're Ramona Flowers right?
C: RAMONA
D: That's me.
C: SCOTT
D: So, you're like American?
C: RAMONA
D: Why, am I coming off as rude?
C: SCOTT
D: Not at all. Noooooo... Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen.
C: RAMONA
D: You know...you need to sign for this. Whatever this is?
C: SCOTT
D: It's something really cool. You'd be impressed.
C: RAMONA
D: You still have to sign.
C: SCOTT
D: But if I sign for it, you'll leave.
C: RAMONA
D: Yeah. That's how it works.
C: SCOTT
D: Okay well, can we just maybe just hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever. I mean...there are reasons for you to hang out with me?
C: RAMONA
D: You're all over the place.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 28.
C: SCOTT

C: RAMONA
D: You want me to hang out with you?
C: SCOTT
D: Um...you know...if that's cool.

S: EXT. PARK - NIGHT

D: Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.
C: SCOTT
D: Sorry, I just assumed you were too cool to be on time.

N: INTEGRATED FINAL 29.
C: RAMONA
D: I'm not into simulated violence.
C: SCOTT
D: I'm cool with whatever you want to do.
C: RAMONA
D: This is good. Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.
C: SCOTT
D: This is good. So how'd you end up in Toronto?
C: RAMONA
D: Just needed to escape I guess.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh yeah?
C: RAMONA
D: I got this job here. And Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities so...
C: SCOTT
D: Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend?
C: RAMONA
D: He's...a friend.
C: SCOTT
D: Was he your boyfriend?
C: RAMONA
D: Do you mind if we don't get into that right now?
C: SCOTT
D: It's so not interesting to me. They sit on some swings in the park.
C: RAMONA
D: So what about you? What do you do?
C: SCOTT
D: I'm between jobs.
C: RAMONA
D: Between what and what?
C: SCOTT
D: My last job is a long story filled with sighs.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 30.
C: RAMONA
D: I know plenty of those.
C: SCOTT
D: Is that why you left New York?

D: Pretty much. It was time to head somewhere a little more chilled.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, it's certainly chilled here.
C: RAMONA
D: Yeah. Uh. Chilled as in cold.
C: RAMONA
D: Yeah.
C: SCOTT
D: I'm totally obsessed with you.
C: RAMONA
D: I didn't mean to get you obsessed.
C: SCOTT
D: I just haven't been obsessed with a girl for a long time. It's weird.
C: RAMONA
D: That's probably because you sleep with a guy.
C: SCOTT
D: Um...
C: RAMONA
D: I was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do!
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 31.
C: SCOTT
D: It's... we're just poor! We can't afford two beds! We're not gay! Actually... no... Wallace is pretty gay.
C: RAMONA
D: Dude, relax. I believe you. You're too desperate to be gay.
C: SCOTT
D: I feel so stupid.
C: RAMONA
D: Aw... you're probably not that stupid. Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing.
C: SCOTT
D: I'm... mostly stupid.
E: CONT'D
C: RAMONA
D: Well, you're definitely stupid if you want to go out with me.
C: SCOTT
D: Exactly, yeah. The snowfall gets heavier.
C: RAMONA
D: This is ridiculous. Isn't it like April?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. I can barely see you. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster.
C: RAMONA
D: I think 'act of God' is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.
C: SCOTT
D: So this is a 'date', eh?
C: RAMONA
D: Did I say 'date'? Slip of the tongue.
C: SCOTT
D: Tongue... The snow gets heavier still. Ramona walks away.
C: RAMONA
D: Anyway, night's not over yet. I think there's a thingy up here somewhere.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 31A.
C: SCOTT
D: A thingy?
C: RAMONA

S: INT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

C: RAMONA
D: What kind of tea do you want?
C: SCOTT
D: There's more than one kind?
C: RAMONA
D: We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffle, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, constant comment and earl grey.
C: SCOTT
D: Did you make some of those up?
C: RAMONA
D: I think I'll have sleepytime.
C: SCOTT
D: That sounds good to me.
C: RAMONA
D: Let me get you a blanket.
C: SCOTT
D: That would actually be awesome. Ramona exits. After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs. He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt.
C: RAMONA
D: Dude! I'm changing. Scott covers his eyes and our screen goes BLACK.
C: SCOTT
D: AAAH! Sorry, I'm just...cold!
E: O.S.
C: RAMONA
D: Here, does this help?
E: O.S.

E: O.S.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 33. Scott opens his eyes to see Ramona hugging him.
C: SCOTT
D: Ohh...kay. They look into each others eyes...camera circles Scott and Ramona as they begin an awesome make out session. Scott imagines himself soundtracking the kiss with a slinky bassline. Ramona breaks off, smiling. Scott is in heaven.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Were you..were you just going to bring the blanket from your bed?
E: CONT'D
C: RAMONA
D: I guess...
C: SCOTT
D: Maybe...maybe we should both get under it...since we're so cold.
C: RAMONA
D: Well...what about our tea?
C: SCOTT
D: I can...not have tea. The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off, revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-
C: RAMONA
D: I changed my mind.
C: SCOTT
D: Changed it to what? From what?
C: RAMONA
D: I don't want to have sex with you, Pilgrim. Not right now.
C: SCOTT
D: Ohh...kay.
C: RAMONA
D: It's not like I'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything. You can sleep in my bed. And I reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later. Ramona curls up next to Scott.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 34.
C: SCOTT
D: This is cool, just this. It's been like a really long time, and this is...I think I needed this. Whatever this is. So, thanks.
C: RAMONA
D: You're welcome. They exchange a smile. Then without warning we jump cut to -
S: INT. RAMONA'S ROOM - MORNING
N: DAYLIGHT! Scott awakens. Ramona is gone. An arrow points to the empty spot in the bed next to him.
C: 'NO RAMONA'
D: Another arrow point out that-
C: 'SHE'S IN THE SHOWER'
D: Ramona steps out of the bathroom in a towel. Scott relaxes.

D: I have to work.
C: SCOTT

C: RAMONA
D: You have to leave.
S: EXT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Ramona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to her. WAIST DEEP SNOW covers the roads and sidewalks.

C: RAMONA
D: What did you have in mind?

C: KIM
D: Once we're on stage you'll be fine.
C: STILLS
D: We were just on stage. For sound check. The sound guy hated us.
C: SCOTT
D: It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters. People love us. Right? Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.

N: INTEGRATED FINAL 40. MATTHEW PATEL lands onstage and glares at Scott through a lopsided fringe. He wears an evil grin and a jacket that borders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out).
C: MATTHEW PATEL
D: Mr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew Patel. Consider our fight...begun!
C: SCOTT
D: What did I do? Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.

D: What do I do?!
N: WALLACE
C: FIGHT!

D: Watch out! It's that one guy!

D: Didn't you get my e-mail explaining the situation?
C: SCOTT
D: I skimmed it.
C: MATTHEW PATEL
D: You will pay for your insolence! Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy.
C: WALLACE
D: What's up with his outfit?

C: SCOTT
D: You really went out with this guy?
C: RAMONA
D: Yeah, in the seventh grade. The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK.
C: RAMONA
D: It was football season and for some reason, all the little jocks wanted me. Matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school, probably in the entire state, so we joined forces and took 'em all out. We were one hell of a team. Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers. Nothing but pre-teen capriciousness. We only kissed once. After a week and a half, I told him to hit the showers.
E: CONT'D
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 41A. The spotlight swings back onto Scott and Patel. INTEGRATED FINAL 42.

C: MATTHEW PATEL

C: MATTHEW PATEL
D: If you want to fight me, you're not the brightest. You won't know what's hit you in the slightest. Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him.
E: CONT'D
C: MATTHEW PATEL
D: Me and my fireballs and my Demon Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the talk because I know I'm slick. Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott. He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack.
E: CONT'D
C: MATTHEW PATEL
D: Fireball Girls! Take this sucker down. The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him.
E: CONT'D
C: MATTHEW PATEL
D: Let us show him what we're all about. Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs. They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: That doesn't even rhyme. Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.
C: MATTHEW PATEL
D: This is impossible, how can it be?! Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face.
C: SCOTT
D: Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 42A. K.O! Scott punches Patel. He explodes into COINS. They clatter to the stage floor. Scott lands and picks them up.

N: Scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them.
C: SCOTT

C: SCOTT
D: Sooooooo... A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home.
C: SCOTT
D: What was all that all about?

D: Someone's happy.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, someone got to second base last night. And someone has a second date tonight.
C: WALLACE
D: Someone's lucky then.
C: SCOTT
D: You know when I say 'someone', I mean me, right? I got to second base last night...maybe first and a half. Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 45.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh, hey, I'm inviting Ramona over for dinner, so you can't be here tonight. I don't want you gaying up the place.
E: CONT'D
C: WALLACE
D: Okay, Scott. But in return I have to issue an ultimatum.
C: SCOTT
D: One of your famous ultimatums?
C: WALLACE
D: It may live in infamy...You have to break up with Knives. Today. Okay? Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.
C: SCOTT
D: But...but...it's HARD.
C: WALLACE
D: If you don't do it, I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives. I swear to God, Scott.
C: SCOTT
D: But you...you're... At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and helps himself to coffee.
C: JIMMY
D: Morning. Scott points bacon at Wallace accusingly.
N: SCOTT (CONT'D) DOUBLE STANDARD!
C: WALLACE
D: I didn't make up the gay rulebook. If you have a problem with it, take it up with Liberace's Ghost.
C: SCOTT
D: You're a monster.
C: WALLACE

C: SCOTT
D: So, this Lucas Lee-
C: WALLACE
D: Lucas Lee is not important to you right now! Get out.
C: SCOTT
D: You suck. Surprising no one. Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Listen close and listen hard, bucko. The next click is me hanging up. The one after that...is me pulling the trigger.
E: ON TV
S: EXT. PAYPHONE ON BUSY STREET - DAY
N: A shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want to, like, talk or whatever?
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Are you wearing a tan jacket? Like a spring jacket? And a hoodie?
E: O.S.
C: SCOTT
D: Ummm... Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: And a dorky hat?!
E: O.S.

D: Oh. Uh...okay. Hi.
E: CONT'D
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 47.

C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I can't believe they're coming to town. Will you take me to the show?

C: SCOTT
D: Like, Chinese food?
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Yeah.
C: SCOTT

C: KNIVES CHAU
D: No, it's okay. Why?
C: SCOTT
D: Well I mean, I'm too old for you!
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: No you're not! My Dad is nine years older than my Mom...
C: SCOTT
D: And...and...are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever?
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I don't care. I'm in...LOVE!

D: Um, listen...I was thinking we should break up or whatever.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 48.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Really?

S: INT. THE BUS / RECORD STORE - DAY

C: SCOTT
D: Oh. No. We broke up. Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look.
C: SCOTT

D: Newnew. Kim mimes shooting herself. Stills unplugs Scott's amp.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Okay! From here on out, no GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at practice, whether they're old, new or new-new. We were lucky to survive that last round. This is sudden death now. Okay?
C: SCOTT
D: Okay!
N: DINGY DONG...
C: SCOTT
D: That's for me. Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting BLUE HAIR.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Hey...you're here?
E: CONT'D
C: RAMONA
D: Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool? Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development.

C: SCOTT
D: It's all blue.

D: I'm Neil.
C: KIM PINE
D: Believe it or not, I actually dated Scott in high school.
C: RAMONA
D: Got any embarassing stories?

D: Uh, what about rehearsal?
C: SCOTT
D: Neil knows my parts.
N: YOUNG NEIL (TO STILLS) I'm Neil.
S: INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Ramona lounges, reading a magazine. A tense Scott hurries around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on.

D: Are you doing okay there?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, good. Good. Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act.
C: SCOTT
D: She changed her hair.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 50A.
C: WALLACE
D: So? It looks nice blue.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 51.
C: SCOTT
D: I know, but she changed it without even making a big deal about it. She's spontaneous. Impulsive. Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?
C: WALLACE
D: I can't believe you were worried about me gaying up the place. Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket.
C: RAMONA
D: How's dinner coming along?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, good. Good.
C: WALLACE
D: I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my hetero crush. Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.
C: SCOTT
D: Don't go.
C: WALLACE
D: Will you man the hell up? You could get to 2nd and a half base.
C: SCOTT
D: You think so?
C: WALLACE
D: Well, if you strike out in the next hour, come find me at the Castle.
C: SCOTT
D: 'If I strike out'?
C: WALLACE
D: Okay, 'when'. See you in sixty.
N: '15 MINUTES LATER' Ramona and Scott eat on the floor, picnic style. Scott has cooked garlic bread (and only garlic bread) for dinner.
C: RAMONA
D: This is actually really good garlic bread.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 52.
C: SCOTT
D: Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just all the time without even stopping.
C: RAMONA
D: You'd get fat.
C: SCOTT
D: No. Why would I get fat?
C: RAMONA
D: Bread makes you fat.
C: SCOTT
D: Bread makes you FAT??
N: '15 MINUTES LATER' A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar.
C: SCOTT
D: So I wrote a song about you.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh yeah?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh.
C: RAMONA
D: I can't wait to hear it when it's finished.
C: SCOTT
D: Finished?
N: '15 MINUTES LATER' Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she runs her hands through his hair.
C: RAMONA
D: Your hair's pretty shaggy.
N: SCOTT OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!? Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback.
C: RAMONA
D: What?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 53.
C: SCOTT
D: Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I got... I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up. But it's so long ago, I can barely remember it... A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.
C: NARRATOR
D: Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup. He blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since.
C: RAMONA
D: Sounds like a bad time.
C: SCOTT
D: Not really.
C: NARRATOR
D: It was.
C: SCOTT
D: It was a mutual thing.
C: NARRATOR
D: It wasn't.
C: SCOTT
D: I mean, she told me it was mutual.
C: NARRATOR
D: She dumped him. It was brutal.
C: RAMONA
D: What was her name?
C: SCOTT
D: She was Nat when I knew her. But she stopped liking that name. Then...she stopped liking me...
C: RAMONA
D: Your hair is cute. I like it long.
C: SCOTT
D: But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?! Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.
C: RAMONA
D: What? Why are you wearing that?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 54.
C: SCOTT
D: I thought we could go for a walk.
S: EXT. ENDLESS STAIRWAY - NIGHT
N: '15 MINUTES LATER' Scott and Ramona climb a STAIRWAY, long handrail between them.
C: RAMONA
D: Tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat.
C: SCOTT
D: Nooo. I just love me some walking. Putting one leg in front of the other.
C: RAMONA
D: You seem a little...heightened.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs, unless you do, in which case I do drugs all the time, every drug, but...you make me feel...I don't know. Things seem a little brighter around you or something. Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.
C: RAMONA
D: What is this place?
C: SCOTT
D: A totally awesome castle. They're shooting this movie up here. Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded by big, bright movie set lights.
C: RAMONA
D: Who's in it?
C: SCOTT
D: Winifred Hailey and some actor guy.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh, who?
C: SCOTT
D: I forget. Let's find out.

C: WALLACE
D: I want to have his adopted babies.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh, man. We gotta go.
C: SCOTT
D: What? Why?

C: WALLACE
D: Slut.
C: RAMONA
D: Wallace. I am not a slut.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 56.
C: WALLACE
D: I can think of no higher accolade. Lucas steps to his mark and puffs up into action hero mode.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Action. Lucas Lee points his board at the GOON.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh...my...God...
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Hey. The only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass.
C: SCOTT
D: ...you dated a FAMOUS guy?!
C: RAMONA
D: In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually, it might have been math. I just remember there being lots of drama.
N: LUCAS LEE
C: HEY!!!
D: Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.
C: RAMONA
D: He just followed me around. He was a little snot nosed brat.
C: SCOTT
D: He had snot? In his nose? But he's famous!
N: LUCAS LEE HEY!!!
C: RAMONA
D: It's not a big deal. I only dated him for a week and a half-
C: LUCAS LEE
D: I'm talking to you Scott Pilgrim! Lucas Lee stomps towards Scott, who gasps.
C: SCOTT
D: He's famous and he talked to me!
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 56A.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: The only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass!
C: SCOTT
D: Can I get- POW! Lucas Lee punches Scott, flooring him. Scott comes back up with a pen and paper, wobbly.
C: SCOTT
D: Can I get your autograph? POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Sup. How's life? He seems nice. Lucas Lee THROWS Scott up into a castle turret, crumbling it. Scotts CRASHES down through scaffolding onto the set. Lucas holds up his hands for a quick continuity photo, then stomps over to pick up a dazed Scott from the ground.
C: WALLACE
D: Scott. Evil ex. Fight.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 57.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Think you stand a chance against an A-lister, bro? Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Some competish you are. Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done- Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Looks like you're seeing double. Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines. POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.
E: O.S.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: He's good, right? Sometimes I let him do wide shots if I feel like getting blazed back in my winnie. Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: I'm nothing without my stunt team. The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.
C: WALLACE
D: Ask them how it feels to always get his sloppy seconds!
C: SCOTT
D: How does it feel to- KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: I'm gonna get coffee. You homies want anything? We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing.
C: SCOTT
D: Mr. Lee?
E: O.S.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 58. Lucas turns, shocked to see Scott, in front of a PAINTED 2-D SKYLINE BACKDROP, surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen.
C: SCOTT
D: You're needed back on set. Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP! Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline. Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Prepare... prepare to feel the wrath of the League of Evil Exes!
C: SCOTT
D: The League of Evil Axes?
C: LUCAS LEE
D: You really don't know about the "The League"?

C: SCOTT
D: Really?
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer. Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw.

C: SCOTT
D: But are you a pretty good skater?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 59.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: I'm more than pretty good, ese. I have my own skate company. Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo.
C: SCOTT
D: So you can sell them, but can you do a thingy on that rail? Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: It's called a grind, bro.
C: SCOTT
D: So can you do a grind thingy now?
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Are you serious? There's like 200 steps and the rails are garbage.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, if it's too hardcore...
C: LUCAS LEE
D: You really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that?
C: SCOTT
D: There's girls watching.

C: WALLACE
D: Hi. Big fan.
C: LUCAS LEE
D: Why wouldn't you be? CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail. Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight, sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS... Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.

S: INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Scott slumps on the couch, phone pressed to his ear. Wallace cooks bacon in the kitchen (no pants). We hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE: This is an automated voice messaging system. RAMONA is not available, please record your message after the beep.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me back. Scott Pilgrim.
N: (HANGS UP) What's the deal? Seriously. Scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it.

D: You know what really sucks though?
C: WALLACE
D: What?
C: SCOTT

D: Seven deadly X's.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 61. Wallace cocks an eyebrow. Scott slides to the floor.
C: SCOTT
D: Why does everything have to be so complicated? Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor.
C: WALLACE
D: If you want something bad, you have to fight for it. Step up your game. Break out the L-word.
C: SCOTT
D: Lesbian?
C: WALLACE
D: The other L-word.
C: SCOTT
D: Lesbians?
C: WALLACE
D: Okay, it's 'love'. I wasn't trying to trick you or anything. Look, if she's really the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know. You have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path. You have the spirit of a warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be with her! It's your destiny!
N: (BEAT) Plus, I need you to move out. Scott's face falls, completely shocked at this bombshell.
C: SCOTT
D: What? Why? Are you moving in with Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?
C: WALLACE
D: Or someone. Either way, I'm kind of banking on her calling you back so I won't have to evict you and feel all guilty and shit. RINGY RING. Scott and Wallace look at the phone.

N: VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #1 Milk and eggs, bitch. VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #2 On April 4th, 7:30 p.m., you partook a plate of Chicken Parmesan. INTEGRATED FINAL 83. Envy gasps, disgusted.
C: TODD INGRAM
D: Chicken isn't vegan?
N: VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #1 The deveganizing ray! Hit him. The Vegan Police BLAST Todd with arcs of power from their finger guns. Todd's fauxhawk deflates into a bowl cut. TODD INGRAM
C: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
D: Scott rises into a stance to deliver his killer line...
C: SCOTT
D: You once were a vegone, but now you will be gone!
C: TODD INGRAM
D: Vegone? Scott HEADBUTTS TODD, exploding him! POOM! Scott dusts himself off as COINS rain down. Envy stares, jaw ajar.
C: SCOTT
D: Uh, sorry I guess.
C: ENVY
D: Sorry? You just headbutted my boyfriend so hard he burst.
C: SCOTT
D: You kicked my heart in the ass. So I guess we're even. Natalie.
C: ENVY
D: No one calls me that anymore.
C: SCOTT
D: Maybe they should. Now let's get out of here. A battle worn Scott limps through the hole in the wall. Ramona follows, shooting Envy a look on the way out.
C: RAMONA
D: Crummy way to end things, I know. Envy blinks, in shock. Julie pops into shot.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 84.
C: JULIE
D: For the record, I am so pissed off for you right now.

D: Shut the fuck up, Julie.
S: INT. PIZZA PIZZA - NIGHT
N: Sex Bob-Omb, Wallace and Other Scott munch pizza slices. Ramona and Scott, on the fringes. It's an odd mood.
C: WALLACE
D: Envy Adams. I hate that bitch so much I kind of love her.
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Yeah. That Todd guy was cool too. And hot. I liked him. Scott sighs and holds a cold Coke Zero on his forehead.
C: RAMONA
D: Are you okay?
C: SCOTT
D: Uh huh.
C: RAMONA
D: You sure about that?
C: SCOTT
D: Do I look like I'm not okay? Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: We're still going to the after show right?
C: KIM PINE
D: I'm not sure it's gonna be much of a party, I think a third of the band just went 'poom'.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Cool bands never go to their own after parties. It's just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with label guys.
C: KIM PINE
D: Then why would we...oh.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Neil, you down?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 85. Neil is at the counter with a catatonic Knives. He shrugs.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Scott? You're in right?
E: CONT'D
C: RAMONA
D: Do you want to go?
C: SCOTT
D: I kind of almost died back there, so...
C: RAMONA
D: I'm not saying I want to go.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, we can totally go.
C: RAMONA
D: I'll do whatever you want to do.
C: SCOTT
D: So let's go. Scott takes another bite. Other Scott whispers to Wallace.
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Are Scott and Ramona fighting?
C: WALLACE
D: Not to my knowledge.
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Oh.
C: WALLACE
D: I mean, not with fists.
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Oh.
C: WALLACE
D: Yet.
C: OTHER SCOTT
D: Ooh.
S: EXT. AFTER PARTY - NIGHT
N: The whole gang trudge to the after party. Scott limps a bit, lagging behind. Ramona falls back with him.
C: RAMONA
D: We really don't have to go to this thing. It'll probably be a bad scene all around and we've already had a full night.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 85A.
C: SCOTT
D: No, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just-
C: RAMONA
D: It's just...?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 86.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, not that fighting harder and harder battles for your love is getting old or anything...but have you ever dated someone who wasn't a total ass?
C: RAMONA
D: So far you're not a total ass.
C: SCOTT
D: But I'm part ass?
C: RAMONA
D: If it makes you feel better, you're the nicest guy I've dated.
C: SCOTT
D: Wait...is that good?
C: RAMONA
D: It's what I need right now.
C: SCOTT
D: But not...later?
C: RAMONA
D: Scott, I don't have all the answers. I'd just like to live in the moment if I can.
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, I'd just like to live. Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy WAREHOUSE.
S: INT. AFTER PARTY - CONTINUOUS
C: RAMONA
D: Okay, I know Todd was bad news. But are you saying Envy wasn't? We all have baggage.
C: SCOTT
D: My baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes. What did you do to your ex-boyfriends to make them so insane?
C: RAMONA
D: Exes.
N: SCOTT WHATEVER- INTEGRATED FINAL 87.
C: RAMONA
D: No break up is painless. Someone always gets hurt. What about you and that girl Knives?
C: SCOTT
D: Knives?
C: RAMONA
D: Who broke up with who?
C: SCOTT
D: I believe...I broke up with her.
C: RAMONA
D: And was she cool with that?
C: SCOTT
D: Knives is with Young Neil now, she's totally cool with it. They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly.
C: RAMONA
D: You sure about that?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah. She's very mature for her age. It was a very healthy break up. We're all peaches and gravy. We hear an offscreen distant 'nooooo' from Knives.
C: RAMONA
D: And what about you and Kim? They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.
C: SCOTT
D: Me and Kim? I can barely remember. Why, is it important?
C: RAMONA
D: Hey, you want to know everything about my past, dude.
C: SCOTT
D: It was just...yeah. I don't know. It was high school. She had freckles. It was cool, I guess.
C: RAMONA
D: That's it?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 88. Scott and Ramona have reached the bar at the party.
C: RAMONA
D: That's really the whole story?
C: SCOTT
D: OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get with her! I fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude! And I had to fight 96 guys to get to him, too! He was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes! He was totally awesome and I kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth! Does that make you feel any better?
C: RAMONA
D: Well now you are being a total ass. Welcome to the club. In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection: fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.
C: SCOTT
D: Sorry. I'm not usually like this.
C: RAMONA
D: Hey, don't worry. I don't know what I'm like anymore.
C: SCOTT
D: I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing is really messing with my head.
C: RAMONA
D: Exes.
C: SCOTT
D: Why do you keep saying- PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the head, sending him flying across the dance floor. Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER!
C: SCOTT
D: Girl from earlier?
E: CONT'D
C: RAMONA
D: Roxy? Scott gets up. The three square off in a triangle.
C: SCOTT
D: You know this girl?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 89.
C: ROXY
D: Oh boy, does she know me.
C: SCOTT
D: What...is...she...talking about?
C: ROXY
D: He really doesn't know?
C: SCOTT
D: You and her?!
E: ping!
N: 'ROXY RICHTER, 23, 4TH EVIL EX : SAPPHIC AGGRESSIVE.'
C: RAMONA
D: It was just a phase.
C: ROXY
D: Just a phase?
C: SCOTT
D: You had a sexy phase?
C: RAMONA
D: I didn't think it would count! It meant nothing.
C: ROXY
D: It meant nothing???
C: RAMONA
D: I was just a little bi-curious.
C: ROXY
D: Well honey, I'm a little bi-furious! Roxy throws a SCORPION KICK at Scott's face. Ramona CATCHES her foot mid-air. Roxy flips out of the hold.
C: RAMONA
D: Do that again and I will end you.
C: ROXY
D: Back off hasbian. If Gideon can't have you, no one can. The League hath spoken. The girls square off, clearing the busy dance floor.
C: RAMONA
D: Then Gideon best get his pretentious ass up here, 'cos I'm about to kick yours out of the Great White North.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 90.
C: ROXY
D: You unbelievable bitch. RAMONA pulls a LARGE HAMMER from her purse.
C: RAMONA
D: Believe it. An embarrassed Scott watches with the rest of the crowd.
C: SCOTT
D: Wallace?
C: WALLACE
D: Uh huh?
C: SCOTT
D: This is happening right?
C: WALLACE
D: Uh huh.
C: SCOTT
D: I mean, this is live?
C: WALLACE
D: Oh yeah. KICK HER IN THE BALLS,
C: RAMONA!
D: With blinding speed, Roxy slips her belt off and WHIPS A RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere. PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out. Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window.
C: ROXY
D: I'm sending you back to Gideon in a thousand pieces, you slag. Ramona springs off of various pieces of furniture, LEAPING towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it.
C: RAMONA
D: I'd rather be dead than go back. He's a creep, you're a bitch and you all deserve each other.
C: ROXY
D: Give it a rest, Ramona. This is a League game.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 90A.
C: RAMONA
D: Meaning? Roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified Scott.
C: ROXY
D: Meaning your precious Scott must defeat me with his own fists. Or possibly feet.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 91.
C: SCOTT
D: I'm not sure I can hit a girl. They're soft.
C: RAMONA
D: You don't have a choice. Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES with deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces.
C: ROXY
D: Fight your own battles, lazy ass! PAF! Roxy disappears then REAPPEARS between Scott and Ramona, kicking them apart with the splits. Roxy then KICKS Scott into the ceiling. He lands HARD on the floor.
C: ROXY
D: Every Pilgrim reaches the end of his journey. Some sooner than others. Roxy lifts her leg over her head, preparing to drop her boot of DEATH on Scott's head. She grins at Ramona.
E: CONT'D
C: ROXY
D: Your B.F's about to get F'd in the B!
E: CONT'D
C: RAMONA
D: Her weak point's the back of her knees!
C: SCOTT
D: What? How does that work?
C: RAMONA
D: Whenever we were making out, I-
C: SCOTT
D: Okay. As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.
N: GRAPHIC: 'TICKLE TICKLE!'
C: ROXY
D: Oh... Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms.
C: ROXY
D: You'll...never...be able to do this to herrrrrrrrrrr! Roxy screams in ecstasy before EXPLODING into COINS. A spent Scott is left standing in the middle of the room.
E: CONT'D
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 91A. The party starts up again, a wave of gossip spreading around the room. People text furiously and point fingers at Scott. INTEGRATED FINAL 92. Scott flushes red and retreats back to the bar. Ramona follows tentatively. The gossip echoes around them.
C: RAMONA
D: Sooooo...
C: SCOTT
D: Two gin and tonics please.
C: RAMONA
D: I thought you didn't drink.
C: SCOTT
D: Only on special occasions. Why? Did you want one? Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.
C: RAMONA
D: I guess we really don't know that much about each other do we? Scott seems immediately drunk.
C: SCOTT
D: Maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least I know who's going to beat my ass into the ground next.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh, like a handy little laminate or something? Let me see if I can find one. Maybe we could exchange our information. Scott has already downed his second drink.
E: looks through bag
C: SCOTT
D: Just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party you haven't slept with?
N: EVERY GUY AND GIRL AT THE PARTY
C: HEY!
D: Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair.
C: RAMONA
D: I really think we should split.
C: SCOTT
D: As in 'get out of here'? Or as in 'split split'?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 92A.
C: RAMONA
D: I'd hope you could figure that out. Or did you miss the part where I saved your ass?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 93.
C: SCOTT
D: How could I not? I feel like we just washed our sexy laundry in public.
C: RAMONA
D: Dirty laundry. You're drunk.
C: SCOTT
D: I've had like one drink.
E: holds up 2 fingers
C: RAMONA
D: Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm sick of it. I thought you might be more understanding.
N: SCOTT I JUST-
C: RAMONA
D: You're just another evil ex- boyfriend waiting to happen. Ramona walks off and loudly announces.
C: RAMONA
D: And yes, there is someone at this party I haven't slept with. You. Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party. But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST.
E: CONT'D
C: RAMONA
D: P.S. Here's your stupid list. Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-
E: CONT'D
N: 'PATEL, LEE, INGRAM, RICHTER, KATAYANAGI TWINS, GIDEON...'
C: SCOTT
D: Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: You don't know?
S: INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Stills flips to hand drawn sketches of THE KATAYANAGIS, identical Asian twins dressed like pretentious New Wave fops.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: They're the next band in the battle and they are badass.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 94. We reveal a grim, terse Scott playing a doomy bassline. The rehearsal room feels empty without Knives or Ramona.
C: KIM PINE
D: Ramona dated twins?
C: SCOTT
D: Apparently.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: At the same time?
C: SCOTT
D: You know what? I don't know and I don't want to know.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Good. You know how I feel about girls cockblocking the rock.
C: SCOTT
D: Good. I play better in a bad mood.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: If it's gonna be an issue though, Young Neil can fill in for you.
C: SCOTT
D: It's not an issue. You know bands, I know battles. We got it covered.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Well, we'd understand if you didn't want to take part.
C: SCOTT
D: Not only do I want to take part. I want to take them apart.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Okay. I'm getting tingles.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: Whoa...
S: EXT. THE NINTH CIRCLE - NIGHT
N: Sex Bob-Omb and Young Neil load their gear at the venue.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Okay. We're doomed.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: Oh...
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 94A. Flyers cover the outside walls of another rock venue; 'T.I.B.B! SEX BOB-OMB!! THE KATAYANAGI TWINS!!! AMP VERSUS AMP!!!! TWO BANDS ENTER!!!!!! ONE BAND LEAVES!!!!!!!!!!!'
C: KIM PINE
D: That flyer needs more exclamation marks.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 95.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Oh, we are going to get killed.
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: Come on. You're onstage in five.
C: SCOTT
D: Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on first?
C: YOUNG NEIL
D: I think you're both on first?
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Wait...amp versus amp? We're going on stage at the same time?
C: SCOTT
D: That's impossible-
S: INT. THE NINTH CIRCLE, STAGE - NIGHT
C: 'ACTUALLY, NO'
D: Two stages sit on either side of the auditorium. On one: a MONOLITHIC WALL OF ELK AMPLIFIERS. On the other, SEX BOB-OMB, with their dinky LAME BRAND amps behind them.
C: SCOTT
D: Okay. My bad.
C: KIM PINE
D: Your bad is saying my bad. Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: We shouldn't even be here. We shouldn't even be here. Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back.
C: SCOTT
D: Come on man! I put aside my problems for the music. If I can do that, we can do anything.
C: KIM PINE
D: Did you speak to Ramona then?
C: SCOTT
D: What? No. I haven't seen her since the other night.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 95A.
C: KIM PINE
D: Oh. She's totally here.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 96. Kim points to RAMONA in the crowd. She is totally there. Her hair is now the BRIGHTEST GREEN, and she stands next to a nondescript MYSTERY GEEK in blazer and black rimmed glasses. They are chatting. She looks happy. Scott turns bleak again.
C: KIM PINE
D: Scott? Not that I care...but you should talk to her before she's gone...
N: SCOTT THANKS KI-
C: KIM PINE
D: And I really don't care. Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then- Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage. A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear, sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands. KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese. Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean, we can do this. Right?
C: KIM PINE
D: Right.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Scott? Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him.
C: KIM PINE
D: Scott! Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.
C: AUDIENCE DUDE
D: They brought the house down. Now an open air venue, SNOW falls onto the stage. An earth shaking BASS NOTE blows the dust off Sex Bob-Omb... Scott and Stills get into battle position. Scott screams!
E: O.S.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 97. SCOTT WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! WE ARE HERE TO MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH AND GET SAD AND STUFF! 1-2-3-4! Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT, their sound blowing a mass of snow towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome. Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up to the Japanese character for '11'. Their waveforms transform the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON! Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers. Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Let's break up now and get it over with. We screwed the pooch in front of Gideon Graves. We're done.
C: SCOTT
D: Gideon...is here? Where? Stills points to the 'Mystery Geek', who smirks and whispers in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.
C: SCOTT
D: That's Gideon? Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.
C: SCOTT
D: Alright. Let's do this! Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI! The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music. The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in time to the music! Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon. Sex Bob-Omb HAMMER DOWN THE FINAL NOTE:
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 98. The Yeti picks up The Dragon and THROWS it at the Katayanagi Twins, EXPLODING them and their amps into COINS. '+999 ROCKING'
C: KIM PINE
D: That...was epic. The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears, hovering next to Scott. Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: Scott. What are you doing?
C: SCOTT
D: Getting a life. Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still- applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I just came to see the show. I'm not even stalking you. Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.
C: SCOTT
D: You seem... different. Knives shrugs, different.
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: I feel like I know stuff now. Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of GREEN HAIR exiting the building.
C: SCOTT
D: Ramona... Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.
S: EXT. THE NINTH CIRCLE - NIGHT
N: Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue.
C: SCOTT
D: Ramona. I have something I need to tell you.
C: RAMONA
D: Yeah, I have something to-
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 98A. SCOTT (RUSHED) Great. Listen, I know you just play mysterious and aloof to avoid getting hurt. I know you have reasons for not wanting to talk about your past. And I want you to know, I don't care about any of that stuff. Why? Because I'm in lesbians with you.
C: RAMONA
D: What?
C: SCOTT
D: I really, really mean it.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 99.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh. Okay.
C: SCOTT
D: What did you want to tell me?
C: RAMONA
D: That we have to break up.
C: SCOTT
D: What?
C: RAMONA
D: Yeah...it's not going to work out.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh okay... A sleek black '61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.
C: RAMONA
D: It's Gideon. I just...I can't help myself around him.
C: VOICE
D: That's the bad news. GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.
E: O.S.
C: GIDEON GRAVES
D: The good news, Scottie, is I'm officially loving the Sex Bombs.
C: SCOTT
D: Bob-omb.
C: GIDEON GRAVES
D: Three piece rock outfit with a semi- attractive female drummer? Music to my earholes. Scott glowers. Ramona looks at the floor. Stills is ga-ga. TEXT: An arrow points to Stills' crotch, captioned 'PEE'.
C: GIDEON GRAVES
D: You know, I'm not even going to wait to see how you guys do in the final. I'm signing you right now for a three album deal. Gideon produces a CONTRACT and clicks a pen.
C: GIDEON GRAVES
D: See? I'm not such a bad guy after all.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 99A. Scott GRABS the contract and throws it onto the sidewalk. INTEGRATED FINAL 100.
C: SCOTT
D: You think we're gonna sell our souls to you? Well then guess- We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.
C: SCOTT
D: Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band with this douche-in-charge.
C: GIDEON GRAVES
D: Scottie, buddy, can I just say, keep your emotions in check. Don't let what's past screw up your future. Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.
C: STEPHEN STILLS
D: The people need to hear us, Scott.
C: SCOTT
D: Then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass. A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.
C: GIDEON
D: Looks like we're all set. Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.
C: GIDEON
D: Oh and Scott, we should really be thanking each other. I mean, if it wasn't for me, you would have never been with Ramona, but if it wasn't for you, she wouldn't be back with me. So I guess it all shakes out. Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.
C: GIDEON
D: And hey, the whole League of Evil Exes thing? I was in a dark place when I put that together. Forgiven? Gideon disappears into the Lincoln and drives off and Sex Bob-Omb drift away. Scott stands alone. He slaps his head-
C: SCOTT
D: I said 'lesbians'!
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 100A.
S: INT. THE BUS / GIDEON'S LINCOLN - NIGHT
N: Scott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Ramona... Ramona sits expressionless in the back of Gideon's car... Scott tries desperately to think positive... A smiling Gideon sidles closer to Ramona... INTEGRATED FINAL 101. Scott walks forlornly down an empty street and bumps his head on a telephone pole. 'THONK'. 'OH GOD WHY'
S: A88 EXT. THE PARK - NIGHT / DAY / NIGHT A88
N: Scott sits on the swings, staring straight ahead. Night turns to day. Day turns to night. Scott remains in the exact same position.
C: STACEY
D: Was she really the one? Scott looks over to see STACEY on the swing next to him.
E: O.S.
C: SCOTT
D: The wha?
C: STACEY
D: I mean, did you really see a future with this girl?
C: SCOTT
D: Like...with jetpacks? Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug.
C: STACEY
D: Time heals all wounds, little brother. Maybe next time let's not date the girl with eleven evil ex- boyfriends.
C: SCOTT
D: Seven.
C: STACEY
D: Oh. Well that's not so bad. Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera.
S: INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Scott enters. Flicks the light on. Gets a shock.
C: SCOTT
D: Aaah!
N: WALLACE (O.S.)
C: TURN OFF THE LIGHT!

N: INTEGRATED FINAL 102.

E: O.S
C: VOICE

D: Was that Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?
E: O.S.

E: O.S.
C: WALLACE
D: It's Chris.
E: O.S.
S: INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Scott sits in the chair, wrapped in a blanket. SOME GUY lies in Scott's usual futon spot (wearing Wallace's monogrammed robe). Wallace hands Scott cocoa.
C: WALLACE
D: Scott, you know I love you. But I need my own bed tonight. For sex.
C: SCOTT
D: Right.
C: WALLACE
D: I may need it the rest of the week too.
C: SCOTT
D: Right. And the year.
C: SCOTT
D: I get it.
C: WALLACE

C: COMEAU
D: Yeah, their first album is so much better than their first album. Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

D: Ramona. My cane. Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle. He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there. Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands. Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.
C: SCOTT
D: Your club sucks, by the way. Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.
C: GIDEON
D: If my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically Canadian sensibilities, then I shall grant you a swift exit from the premises. And fast entrance into HELLLLLLL. Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...

C: GIDEON
D: You can't say I don't know how to put on a show. GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.
C: RAMONA
D: What the hell is your deal?
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: You stole him with your advanced American slut technology. DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other, throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE.
C: RAMONA
D: I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't steal anyone. Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 109.
C: SCOTT
D: Can we please stop all this fighting! Nobody stole anybody. Knives, I dated you and then I dated Ramona. Okay?
N: (BEAT) I mean...maybe I kind of forgot to tell Knives right away, but...
C: KNIVES CHAU
D: Then you cheated on me, Scott!
N: (EYES NARROWING) You cheated on both of us. Knives and Ramona both look at Scott, neither amused.
C: RAMONA
D: You cheated on me with Knives?
C: SCOTT
D: No! I cheated on Knives. With you.

D: You know what sucks? Getting killed by THAT guy. Why him?
C: RAMONA
D: It's complicated.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. Seeing as I'm about to die.
C: RAMONA
D: Alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention.
C: SCOTT
D: So why go back?
C: RAMONA
D: I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just... has a way of getting into my head.
C: SCOTT
D: Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now...
C: RAMONA
D: No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull.
C: SCOTT
D: That is evil.
C: RAMONA
D: He's like that. Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair.

D: So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh?
N: INTEGRATED FINAL 111.
C: RAMONA
D: I'm sorry it had to end this way. We had a good run, I guess.

C: RAMONA
D: Uh-huh. The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away.
C: RAMONA
D: But someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there. Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,
C: SCOTT
D: Knives?
C: RAMONA
D: I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.
C: SCOTT
D: I feel like I learned something. Which would be great if I wasn't dead. Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.
C: SCOTT
D: So...so alone. DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott.

E: O.S.
C: SCOTT
D: Wallace, when my journey began, I was living in an ordinary world. Ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure, a call I considered refusing. But my Mentor, that's you, told me if I want something bad enough I have to fight for it. So I did. There were tests, allies, enemies. I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along. But before I do that, I need to ask one final favor of you.
C: WALLACE
D: Sure thing, guy.

Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning to spring. Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of 'Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's cell phone airwaves.
