The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head. EYES glint. On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA. Three Purple Hearts, photos of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales. TIGHTER into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL COMBAT. IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be... IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN... Now we are the coffin as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND. Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY. Images of the cemetery are reflected in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES. Suddenly AN EXPLOSION and we see -- A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the communication ...

D: What's hap... what's happening....?
N: DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel.
C: DR. LING
D: Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear. You're okay.
N: Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and grabs A SCALPEL. Cuts open the doll's chest.

C: DR. LONNER
D: It's coming, it's coming ...
N: ISHERWOOD sinks to his knees, holding the huge syringe in front of his heart, hari-kari style, hands trembling ... GOODSPEED concentrates on the device; his calm is unsettling. His hands flash, grabbing instruments and performing precise, deft, functions. He snips a wire and splices it. Another. Another.
C: DR. LING
D: Ten seconds, Bill.
E: sweating it out
N: Isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest.
C: ISHERWOOD
D: Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY IT'S REAL.

N: Cpts. Hendrix, before Hummel. Frye, and Darrow, and Sgt. Crisp at attention Maj. Baxter at Hummells side.
C: HUMMEL
D: At ease, Gentlemen. It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation. The heart performs one thing, the legs another, the brain another - all better function together or the body becomes ill, is prone to disease. Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my adjutant in the Gulf. Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a beatnik.

N: Hummel looks from face to face, studying each.
C: HUMMEL
D: The question is what kind of traitor are we. Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson? I have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear. Have all of you?

C: HUMMEL

C: RAYDEN SINCLAIR
D: No. Give me the skinny.

D: I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...
C: HAYDEN SINCLAIR
D: Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into China.
N: There is a pause.
C: HUMMEL
D: Who is that. Identify yourself.
N: Everyone stares at sinclair.
C: HAYDEN SINCLAIR
D: White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.
C: HUMMEL
D: How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.
C: RAYDEN SINCLAIR
D: I'm thirty-three.
C: HUMMEL
D: Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth. He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.
N: Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again, who hands him a phone and whispers:
C: NAVAL ATTACHE
D: The President calling from Moscow.
N: Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking sotto voice.
C: GENERAL KRAMER
D: Continue Frank.
C: HUMMEL
D: Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and El Salvador. Remember the Gulf War. Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets. Ten were left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen. No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred. These men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial. This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading Company" account to an account I designate. From these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families. The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses. Am I clear?
E: beat
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that?
C: HUMMEL
D: Identify yourself.
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: F.B.I. Director Womack, General.
C: HUMMEL
D: You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.
C: GENERAL KRAMER
D: Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.
C: WOMACK
D: Is this true?
E: stunned
N: General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.
C: HUMMEL
D: If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from. Good luck.
N: Hayden Sinclair returns to the table.
C: HAYDEN SINCLAIR
D: General, I've just spoken to the President and he is clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care if ...
C: HUMMEL
D: Someone please gag that man. Alert the media, I launch the gas. Refuse payment, I launch the gas. It is just after midnight. You have 36 hours - all of today and half of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money. Don't even consider the standard counter measure, General.
E: beat
C: GENERAL KRAMER
D: What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with V.X., General Peterson?
C: GENERAL PETERSON
D: In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...
C: RAYDEN SINCLAIR
D: Well that's not so bad ...
C: I GENERAL PETERSON
D: Thousand. Seventy thousand. Dead. one teaspoon will kill all living organisms in a three story office building. Get the point?
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?
C: GENERAL PETERSON
D: Napalm. Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm. It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation. The problem is that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.
C: GENERAL KRAMER
D: 'Course he does. "Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still in its test phase. It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X. That explains Hummells time frame. He knows we're not operational. What would it take, General?
E: explaining to others dawning on him
C: GENERAL PETERSON
D: To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36 hours? An act of God. All right, we can try. But view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.
E: off Kramer's look
C: GENERAL KRAMER
D: Then on to our primary initiative. Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. Who's your best chemical biological man?
E: hits intercom button to F.B.I. Womack
C: AGENT WOOD
D: I'll find out.
E: rises
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: Tell him to pack a bag for San Francisco.
N: EXT. GOODSPEED'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT Tarpaper and gravel roof. Candles burning. Loretta Lynnls "Stand by Your Man" on the boom box. AMONGST THE RUSTY SUPPORT SCAFFOLDS of an old sign from the 120's -- CARLA and GOODSPEED are, to put it delicately, madly passionately athletically fucking. Standing up. They both have robes on. A CORDLESS PHONE RINGS. Again.
C: CARLA
D: Don't stop... do no stop.
C: GOODSPEED
D: Shit, shit, shit what time is it. Hello. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
E: fumbles for phone pause
N: GOODSPEED hangs up. The couple stares at each other. Carla's seen this look before ...
C: GOODSPEED
D: I've got to go to San Francisco.
C: CARLA
D: No. I'm sorry, but NO. I need you here with me. We need to talk about this...
C: GOODSPEED
D: I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't... I cannot deal with this right now ... Bill, I am very Catholic. And very pregnant. And very unmarried. Help me with this.
E: softly
N: She turns away from him. He pulls her back...
C: GOODSPEED
D: I love you. I will marry you. I just didn't plan on this, that's all. Tell you what: come to San Francisco.
C: CARLA
D: Really? Really?
E: smiles
C: GOODSPEED
D: It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...
C: CARLA
D: ... We'll finish what we started. Baby, are you sexy in those boots ...
N: GOODSPEED walks off in COWBOY BOOTS, robe and boxers,.. INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT U.S.N. commander CHARLES ANDERSON, 35, just the hardest looking man you've ever seen, stands before the group. Anderson is a Navy S.E.A.L., an Incursion Team Leader. Before Anderson are AERIAL RECON PHOTOS of Alcatraz.
C: COMMANDER ANDERSON
D: A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might launch. My second in command is working on an attack from within the prison. The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind - take their rocket positions without a shot fired. But I need better intelligence.
E: beat
C: GENERAL KRAMER
D: You've studied the architectural plans.
C: COMMANDER ANDERSON
D: They're useless. Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort. It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years. Under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language. What I need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels.
E: beat
N: CAMERA FOCUSES ON F.B.I. Director Womack, who gives a very significant look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.
C: GENERAL KRAMER
D: The former warden?
C: AGENT WOOD
D: Died in 1979. The guards we contacted are useless. There was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he died in 1983.
C: GENERAL PETERSON
D: Didn't three guys escape? I thought I saw a movie about it.
C: AGENT WOOD
D: It's a Hollywood myth. No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.
N: F.B.I. Director trades a very significant look with C.I.A. Director AMWAY. Amway clears his throat. He is older, very old school. Everyone turns to him.
C: C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY
D: There is someone who can help us.
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: The C.I.A. Director and I have something to discuss in private.
N: Womack and Amway rise and exit together. Everyone else sits there, confused. INT. PENTAGON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT Womack and Amway exit into the corridor. They huddle tightly against the wall. Sotto voice: -
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: You're not actually suggesting ...
C: C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY
D: The man spent every night for six months making a dry-run of his escape. He knows every inch of that island. We have to, Jim.
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: I am very uncomfortable about this.
N: INT. WOLFBURG PENITENTIARY - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT A long row of cells. CAMERA slowly DOLLIES past cell after cell. Sullen INMATES stare blankly at us ...
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

E: O.S.
N: CAMERA moves through a door marked "ISOLATION." At the end of a gloomy corridor is a CAST-IRON DOOR. BACK TO THE PENTAGON CORRIDOR
C: C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY
D: it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly. When was the last time you saw him?
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: when he escaped from San Quentin.
C: C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY
D: The man was an S.A.S. trained killer.
N: BACK TO WOLFBURG - IN THE ISOLATION CELL TWO FEDERAL MARSHALS open the cell.'s steel locking bar. They push open the door. Dark inside. A MAN sits on the bed.
C: C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY
D: Can we risk letting.him out?
N: A SHAFT OF LIGHT cuts across the cell floor.
C: C.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY
D: The question is: can we not?
N: THE SHAFT OF LIGHT slices the face of JOHN PAUL MASON. He is British, at least once was, imprisoned without trial for 33 years on U.S. soil. For now, we have no idea why.

'We are watching through a TWO-WAY MIRROR, and WIDEN TO: Womack, Goodspeed, Reynolds and ERNEST SANCHEZ, S.F. Bureau Agent in Charge, are watching Mason. Sanchez is a gruff guy with the subtlety of a heart attack.
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: The following is a state secret. Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution. His name is John Mason. A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962, escaped in 1963.
C: AGENT SANCHEZ
D: Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ...
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez. Do not argue and do not question. He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin, from which he escaped in February, 1976. He's been held at Wolfburg since. He has no identity. He does not exist. Understood? I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took through the island's tunnels.
E: turns to Sanchez
C: AGENT SANCHEZ
D: You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
D: Don't even entertain it. This man laughs at strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either.
C: GOODSPEED
D: Why's he going to help us now?
C: U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS
D: Mason's papers are in order, sir.
E: hands Womack PARDON
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

E: congenial
C: MASON
D: You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez? Fucking Bloody Idiots. I don't want to talk to you.
N: A pause. Sanchez glares at Mason.
C: SANCHEZ
D: Just some questions about Alcatraz. It's a tourist attraction now. You remember Alcatraz, Mason.
N: The word "Alcatraz" registers with Mason.
C: MASON
D: Do I remember Alcatraz.
C: SANCHEZ
D: Not the island itself. The tunnels underneath it.
N: IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM
C: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK

C: U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS
D: Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word with you?
E: V.O.

D: Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail.

D: He's already had you for the first course. Go.
E: hands GOODSPEED the pardon
N: GOODSPEED takes the pardon, goes for the door. THE INTERROGATION ROOM GOODSPEED enters. He's completely out of his element, has no idea what he's doing, and is-suddenly face-to-face with this.... MASON creature. The two men regard each other.
C: GOODSPEED
D: Take his cuffs off.
N: The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists. MASON rubs his wrists, staring now at Goodspeed.
C: MASON
