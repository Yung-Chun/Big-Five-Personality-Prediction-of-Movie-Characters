T: FADE IN:
S: INT. OFFICE  ADVERTISING AGENCY  MIDTOWN  EVENING
N: WIDE SHOT A large and very comfortable office over-looking St. Patrick's Cathedral. At the moment the office is filled to bursting with men and women, slumped in chairs, sitting on desks, all of them very tense. Among the crowd of people we note: MURRAY FISHER, a young and very ambitious junior executive and PHYLLIS BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties. She is a lawyer with the agency. At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth. His tie is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds. Clearly he is very distraught.
C: TED
D: They're not gonna call... I tell you they're not gonna call. I blew it. I don't know what I did wrong, but I 
E: predicting the worst
N: REVERSE ON JIM O'CONNOR Ted's boss and good friend. He is in his middle fifties, nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy drinker. He sits back in his chair with his feet propped on the desk and a drink in one hand.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat. Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
E: not unfriendly
C: TED
D: I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I shouldn't have 
E: at this stage, nothing will help
N: Sound-effect: The phone rings. Everyone freezes. As O'Connor reaches for the phone,
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHILD'S ROOM, KRAMER APT.  EVENING
N: The room is dark, the only light coming from a small night light. We SEE a beautiful five year old boy (BILLY KRAMER). He lies in bed, half asleep. HOLD FOR A BEAT as a beautiful woman (JOANNA KRAMER) leans over, kisses the child and hugs him tightly to her.
C: JOANNA
D: I love you, Billy...
E: intense
C: BILLY
D: I love you too, mommy... Good-night...
E: drowsy
N: ON JOANNA She gets up from the bed and starts toward the door of the child's room.
C: JOANNA
D: Sleep tight...
C: BILLY
D: Don't let the bedbugs bite...
N: Joanna stops in the doorway, silhouetted against the light. She turns, takes a last look at her son, then steps outside.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY  EVENING
N: ON JOANNA Now that the light is brighter, we can SEE her more clearly. In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style that can best be described as Bloomingdale's. HOLD FOR A BEAT as she leans against the door. It is clear from her expression that she is terribly upset. Then, making up her mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HER as she carries it into the bedroom, lays it out on the bed and opens it. PAN WITH HER as she crosses to a closet, grabs an armload of clothes and dumps them helter-skelter into the suitcase.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  EVENING
N: It is a few minutes later, the news has obviously been good because there is a general celebration in progress. Jim O'Connor, now standing, raises one hand for silence, then making a toast.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Here's to Ted Kramer.
N: Cheers and good-natured jokes.
C: O'CONNOR
D: I wanna tell you something about this little runt. He went out there and sold the shit out of Revlon and that's why we got the account. It was his idea, it was his concept, right down the line...
E: putting an arm around Ted squeezing him tight
N: More hoots and cheers. People start to yell "Speech."
C: TED
D: All I can say... All I can say is this is maybe one of the five best days of my whole life...
E: embarrassed, but cannot stop grinning
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BATHROOM  KRAMER APT.  EVENING
N: Joanna stands at the medicine cabinet, going through it, packing things in a travel kit: rollers, deodorant, makeup, birth control pills. She starts to take a small bottle of perfume that has only an eighth of an inch of fluid left inside, hesitates, then puts it back.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  EVENING
N: Now some time has passed, most of the crowd has gone and only the regulars are left.
C: TED
D: So anyway Jim and I are making the pitch, right? And all of a sudden this old guy starts to cough and I keep on going and he keeps on coughing and I keep on going and he keeps on coughing and 
E: in the middle of a story
N: Murray Fisher leans over, shakes Ted's hand.
C: MURRAY
D: Congratulations, Ted. That was a hell of a job.
E: interrupting
C: TED
D: Where you goin' Murray, it's early?
E: surprised
C: MURRAY
D: Got to get home.
C: TED
D: Oh, Christ, I'm late... I gotta get out of here. So anyway, I look over and this old geezer is starting to turn blue and I swear to God the only thing I can think about is that this poor sonofabitch is gonna die on me and screw up the pitch.
E: glancing at his watch however, instead of going, he settles back and resumes his story
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KITCHEN  KRAMER APT.  EVENING
N: INSERT: A long and meticulous list that Joanna is making out of the phone numbers and addresses of doctors and hospitals, of what the various medicines are for, and of the foods that Billy is and isn't permitted to eat. WIDER ANGLE As Joanna puts the finishing touches on the list and carefully arranges it on top of the kitchen counter next to a box of unsweetened, whole grain cereal and a jar of honey. Note: It is this same set of notes that Ted will later unthinkingly throw away.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING  MIDTOWN  NIGHT
N: WIDE SHOT As the doors to the outer lobby open and Ted and O'Connor appear. Ted starts to hail a cab, O'Connor stops him.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
C: TED
D: Jim, I've got to go. I'm already late 
C: O'CONNOR
D: Listen, Ted... I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty good feeling they'll kick me upstairs...
N: He turns and starts to walk off down the street, Ted, of course, follows.
C: O'CONNOR
D: ...and when they do, I just want you to know I'm takin' you along with me.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON JOANNA As she goes through her jewelry case, taking some things, leaving others. In the B.G. we SEE a framed photograph of Billy, smiling, looking into the camera.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET  NIGHT
N: ON TED AND O'CONNOR Tracking with them as they walk.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Y'know, Ted, I mean what I said back there. You did a hell of a job on this and I want you to know I'm turning the whole show over to you.
E: feeling no pain
C: TED
D: Wow!
E: thrilled
C: O'CONNOR
D: I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT
N: WIDE SHOT The suitcase is now full. Joanna zips it shut and looks around to make sure that she hasn't forgotten anything. Then, she hefts her suitcase and starts out of the room.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOYER  NIGHT
N: WIDE SHOT Joanna carries in the suitcase, sets it by the front door, then she crosses to the living room and sits down at the dining table. CLOSER IN ON HER She takes out a list made on the back of an old envelope. As she begins to review it, checking off some items: OFF SCREEN Sound: A key turning in the lock. As Joanna looks up...
T: CUT TO:
N: HER POV As the door swings open to reveal Ted Kramer, an enormous grin on his face, a bottle of champagne in his hand. He is so full of himself that he doesn't notice there is anything wrong. Note: Throughout the entire scene he carries the bottle of champagne, never putting it down.
C: TED
D: I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, I'm leaving you.
E: she takes a deep breath, then:
C: TED
D: That represents a gross billing in excess of two million  What?!
E: hearing her
N: Joanna opens her purse, takes out her keys and wallet.
C: JOANNA
D: Here are my keys. I won't be needing them any more.
N: Note: Ted does not for a moment believe that his wife will really leave him. All he can think of right now is that he will have to spend the rest of the evening coping with one of her moods.
C: TED
D: I'm sorry I'm late, all right? I'm sorry I didn't call  I was busy making a living.
E: sardonic
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
N: Joanna doesn't even bother to look up at him. She opens her purse, takes out her wallet and begins removing credit cards.
C: JOANNA
D: My American Express... My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book 
C: TED
D: Okay, okay... What is it this time? What did I do now?...
E: the martyr
C: JOANNA
D: I took two thousand out of the savings account. That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
E: ignoring this
C: TED
D: Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
C: JOANNA
D: Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning. They'll be ready on Saturday.
C: TED
D: Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think -
E: hard lining it
C: JOANNA
D: I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
E: not bothering to look up
N: She checks off the last item on her list as her husband watches, dumbfounded.
C: JOANNA
D: There, that's everything.
N: Joanna gets to her feet and starts toward the front door. In an instant Ted is after her.
C: TED
D: For God's sake, Joanna, would you at least tell me what I did that's so terrible! Would you do me that little favor?
E: panic starting
N: ON JOANNA At the door.
C: JOANNA
D: Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me. It's my fault  you just married the wrong person.
C: TED
D: So we've got problems. Everybody's got problems  that's normal 
E: placating her
N: Joanna opens the door and they step out into the hallway.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KRAMER APT.  EVENING
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
C: TED
D: I'm listening, Joanna  believe me, I'm listening. My wife is walking out on me after eight years of 
C: JOANNA
D: You just don't get it, do you? I  am  really  and  truly  leaving  you.
E: bitter as though to a child
C: TED
D: I heard you, Joanna. I promise I heard you.
C: JOANNA
D: No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy.
E: quietly
C: TED
D: What about Billy?
E: stiffening
C: JOANNA
D: I'm not taking him with me.
C: TED
D: What?
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, I can't... I tried... I really tried but... I just can't hack it anymore...
E: tears start
C: TED
D: C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that. You're a terrific mother 
C: JOANNA
D: I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother. I yell at him all the time. I have no patience. No... No. He's better off without me. Ted, I've got to go... I've got to go.
E: from her gut unable to look at Ted
C: TED
D: Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go... Look, come inside and talk... Just for a few minutes.
E: desperate
C: JOANNA
D: NO!... Please... Please don't make me stay... I swear... If you do, sooner or later... maybe tomorrow, maybe next week... maybe a year from now... I'll go right out the window.
E: pleading looking directly at him
N: Sound-effect: The elevator approaching.
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
N: There is nothing more that can be done, this is the last moment of intimacy.
C: TED
D: Where are you going?
E: quiet
C: JOANNA
D: I don't know...
N: The elevator door opens, Joanna steps inside.
C: TED
D: Do you want me to help you get a cab?
N: Joanna shakes her head. The elevator door closes behind her and it starts to descend. ON TED KRAMER He stands for a moment, stunned, unable to move. Then he turns and races back into the apartment. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he rushes across to one of the living room windows, throws it open and leans out. HIS POV Looking down to the street from the eighth floor. We SEE Joanna step off the curb and hail a passing taxi.
C: TED
D: Joanna!?... Joanna?!
E: calling out
N: Either she doesn't hear him or else she pays no attention. She gets into the cab, closes the door behind her and it drives away.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. APT.  NIGHT
N: ON TED As he stands for a moment watching the taxi as it disappears. Then, slowly, he closes the window, turns, and AS THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, walks into the bedroom. The bedroom is a mess: the closet door stands open, inside Joanna's section is empty except for some shoe-boxes and a few dresses that are scattered across the floor. Several dresser drawers have been pulled out and their contents emptied. HOLD IN A WIDE SHOT as Ted wearily picks up one of the dresses and hangs it back on its hanger in its proper place, ready for Joanna's return. As he continues straightening up the room, THE CAMERA SLOWLY FADES TO BLACK.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM  VERY LATE AT NIGHT
N: WIDE SHOT Ted Kramer paces back and forth, eyeing the phone. Then, coming to a decision, he crosses to it, picks up the receiver and starts to dial.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. APT. BLDG.  LATE AT NIGHT
N: WIDE SHOT The building is dark except for the Kramer apartment which is ablaze with lights. HOLD as we HEAR: Sound: The phone ringing. Then:
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Huh... Hello?
E: obviously asleep
C: TED
D: All right, Thelma... That's it. I've had it. You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay? I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
E: righteous
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Ted, what are you talking about?!
C: TED
D: Don't play innocent with me, Thelma. You know perfectly well what's going on.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying. Where's Joanna?
E: exasperated
C: TED
D: Ha! You tell me.
N: Sound-effect, as Ted slams down the receiver. Instantly a light is turned on two floors below.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOYER  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT
N: ON THE FRONT DOOR As we HEAR: Sound-effect: the doorbell rings. A moment later Ted opens the door and THELMA PHILLIPS enters. She is a neighbor (Apt. 6-B) and Joanna Kramer's best friend. About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley were divorced. Until then the two families had been very close, the Kramer's son (Billy) being about the same age as the Phillips' daughter (Kim). With the divorce, however, the Kramers tried to remain friends with both Thelma and Charley and that has caused a certain amount of friction. Thelma is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. She dresses well, works out religiously at Jack LaLanne's and goes to a therapist twice a week. She is also given to acting the lay analyst with her friends. Thelma is generous with her advice, sharing the wealth so to speak. With all of this she is kind, loyal and a loving friend. At the moment, however, she is all business.
C: THELMA
D: All right. What's going on?
E: looking around, suspiciously
N: ON TED From his attitude it is clear that there is no love lost between them.
C: TED
D: All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
C: THELMA
D: Look, Ted, all I 
C: TED
D: I came home tonight. We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency. Do you know what that means?! Do you understand what that means? It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
E: starting to really roll
C: THELMA
D: Ted, all I wanted to know was where
C: TED
D: I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything. Pow she's out the door.
E: not letting her get a word in edgewise
C: THELMA
D: OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
C: TED
D: Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
E: sarcastic
C: THELMA
D: Ted, don't be so hostile.
N: Ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the Ambassador to the Court of St. James. However, during the following, he begins pounding the pillows on the couch into shape with real vehemence.
C: TED
D: Hostile? Me? Thelma, I'm not hostile. I am anything but hostile. But if you want to know what I am. I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I just want to know one thing, okay? Just one thing... Why? That's all I want to know... Why?
E: pow whack thud sock
C: THELMA
D: Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and... well, she told me a lot of... ah, things about the two of you.
E: how to say this
C: TED
D: Things? What kind of things?
E: instantly nervous
C: THELMA
D: I mean... things. Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and 
E: clearly she knows more than she's willing to say
C: TED
D: Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life. She's got a husband that loves her. She's got a terrific kid. She's got a wonderful home 
E: flash of anger
C: THELMA
D: What d'you know about how Joanna felt? You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
E: getting mad herself
C: TED
D: Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?! Did it?! For one thing she's always thirty minutes late. You can set your watch by it 
C: THELMA
D: So she's late. What's the big deal. That's just a way of saying, "Pay attention to me."
E: exasperated
C: TED
D: Two. She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it. Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially 
E: not listening
C: THELMA
D: Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met. No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
C: TED
D: Joanna said that?
N: Thelma nods.
C: TED
D: Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
C: THELMA
D: Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
C: TED
D: Boy, you guys are really something, y'know? I'd like to know one thing, okay  just one little thing. Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
E: stung
C: THELMA
D: No.
E: stiffly
N: She turns and starts toward the front door, Ted at her heel.
C: TED
D: Y'know something Thelma  you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it. Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
C: THELMA
D: Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay. But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
E: pause
C: TED
D: I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
N: CLOSE ON THELMA That stops her dead in her tracks. She had always assumed that Joanna took Billy with her when she left.
C: THELMA
D: Joanna left Billy? She didn't take him with her?
N: Ted shakes his head. There is a long beat of silence.
C: THELMA
D: Oh Shit.
E: stunned, quiet
T: CUT TO: FADE IN:
S: EXT. KRAMER APT. BLDG.  EARLY MORNING
N: WIDE SHOT It is a beautiful sunny morning and the super stands in front of the building hosing down the sidewalk. HOLD as a garbage truck enters FRAME and the garbage men begin loading sacks of trash into the back of the truck. As it begins to grind up the garbage with an ungodly sound, THE CAMERA PANS UP TO THE EIGHTH FLOOR WINDOWS.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BILLY KRAMER'S BEDROOM  EARLY MORNING
N: MEDIUM SHOT Billy Kramer lies in his bed, fast asleep. HOLD FOR A BEAT as we HEAR: OFF SCREEN Sound: From the street below, the garbage truck grinding up garbage. A moment later, Billy opens his eyes, struggles to his feet and, AS THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, trudges sleepily out of his room, across the hall and into the bathroom.
S: INT. BATHROOM  EARLY MORNING
N: As the child stands in front of the toilet, eyes closed, we HEAR: OFF SCREEN Sound-effect: as the child pees noisily. Then, when he is finished, he turns and, without bothering to flush the toilet, shuffles down the hall and into his parents' bedroom. HIS POV The bed is empty, there is no sign that anyone has slept in it. ON BILLY A look of suspicion on his face, he turns and starts back down the hall toward the living room.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM  EARLY MORNING
N: As Billy enters, looks around. HIS POV Ted Kramer, still fully dressed, looking like the wrath of God is asleep in the chair. ON BILLY As he marches across to his father.
C: BILLY
D: Where's mommy?
N: ON TED His eyes open, he looks around startled.
C: TED
D: Huh?... Oh God... What time is it?
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
C: BILLY
D: The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
E: suspicious
C: TED
D: Oh, Christ... Ah, yeah... you want to know why mom's not here, right?
E: trying to pull himself together
N: Billy nods.
C: TED
D: Okay, I'm going to tell you... It's like this. Mommy and daddy had a little argument and mommy decided she wanted to go off by herself for a little while. You know how sometimes you get mad and want to go off and be by yourself? Well, it's like that, okay? Okay. Now how about some breakfast?
E: bullshit subject closed
N: Ted struggles to his feet and THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they start toward the kitchen.
C: BILLY
D: When is mommy coming back?
C: TED
D: Soon. Very soon.
E: lying
N: By now they are inside the kitchen, Ted looks around. HIS POV There, on the kitchen cabinet is a box of "natural grain" cereal, a jar of honey, some wheat germ, and a banana, with carefully written instructions from Joanna underneath. ON TED He takes one look at the note, crumples it up and tosses it in the wastebasket.
C: TED
D: I'll tell you what, kiddo  why don't I fix us some French toast?
E: the camp counselor
C: BILLY
D: Wow! French toast, really?
E: impressed
C: TED
D: Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is... ...eggs! Right?
E: the camp counselor trying desperately to remember
N: Billy nods. Ted opens the refrigerator and takes some eggs.
C: TED
D: This is terrific... isn't this terrific?
N: As Ted begins the process of making French toast, it soon becomes obvious that he has no idea of what he is doing. What follows is a symphony in incompetence on Ted's part. He breaks the eggs into a bowl and ends up with most of the shell mixed up with the egg. Then he takes a piece of bread and drops it into bowl.
C: TED
D: I'm having a good time... Are you having a good time?
E: saying it will make it so
N: ON BILLY Watching all of this with increasing apprehension.
C: BILLY
D: You forgot the milk.
C: TED
D: That's right. You're absolutely right... It's been a long time since I made French toast.
E: still the camp counselor
N: Ted takes a container of milk, pours it into the bowl so that it is filled to the brim. Then he sloshes the bread
T: around until it is half-dissolved.
C: TED
D: Look at this, isn't this something?!
N: He lops off a huge hunk of butter, drops it into an omelet pan and turns up the flame. ON BILLY Watching. He looks as though he is about to throw up.
C: BILLY
D: What about my orange juice?
C: TED
D: Right. One O.J. coming up.
E: the counterman
N: He opens the refrigerator and starts to get the orange juice. As he does, black smoke begins to billow ominously from the frying pan.
C: BILLY
D: Daddy!!!
E: scared
N: Ted turns, spots the smoke.
C: TED
D: Don't worry... Everything's fine...
N: He lunges for the handle of the frying pan, which by now is very hot. He grabs it, lets out a howl of pain and the whole mess, frying pan, butter, bread, goes crashing to the floor. CLOSE ON TED Suddenly all the rage comes pouring out.
C: TED
D: Goddam! Son of a bitch!
N: REACTION  BILLY Terrified. WIDE SHOT As Ted kneels down and begins to clean up the mess.
C: TED
D: It's okay. It's gonna be okay...
E: to himself as much as to Billy
N: Everything's going to be all right.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET  DAY
N: ON A BUS As it pulls to a stop. The doors open and a stream of mothers and children get off. Among them we spot Ted Kramer with Billy. As they start across the street, Ted reaches down and takes hold of Billy's hand. The moment they get to the far side, Billy takes his hand away from Ted's and wipes it on his pants. Clearly Ted's hands are very sweaty. CLOSER IN ON THEM As they start down the block toward Billy's school. CLOSER IN ON THEM
C: BILLY
D: When is mommy coming back?
C: TED
D: Soon. I told you before, very soon.
C: BILLY
D: Will she pick me up after school?
E: nervous
C: TED
D: No. If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
C: BILLY
D: What if she forgets?
C: TED
D: I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay? Don't worry.
E: weary
N: They walk in silence for a few steps, then:
C: BILLY
D: But what happens if she's on her way to school and she gets runned over by a truck and killed? What happens them?
N: Ted looks at Billy in amazement. WIDE SHOT As the two of them enter the school and disappear from view.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OFFICE, TED'S AGENCY  DAY
N: ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS As they open and Ted steps out looking like the wrath of God. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he crosses the waiting room toward the inner offices. ON THE RECEPTIONIST Glancing up as he passes.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Congratulations, Mr. Kramer.
E: cheerful
N: ON TED Looking at her like she has lost her mind. Nevertheless he continues on, passing through swinging doors into a long corridor lined with secretaries' desks and offices leading off of it. Suddenly a younger man rushes up, grabs Ted's hand and starts to pump it vigorously.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Terrific news, Ted.
N: Another nut. Ted smiles at the man, humoring him and continues toward his office. O'Connor appears, throwing his arm around Ted, squeezing him in a bear hug.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Hey... Look who was out celebrating last night.
N: Suddenly Ted realizes that all these people are congratulating him for getting the Fire and Ice account.
C: TED
D: Uh, Jim... Can I talk to you?
E: trying to appear nonchalant
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY
N: Ted and O'Connor sitting across from one another. O'Connor has just heard the news.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Jesus Christ. That's a real blockbuster. I always figured you guys had it made.
E: shakes his head
C: TED
D: You want to know the real kicker? The real kicker is, for the first time in my life  the first time  I feel like a loser.
E: morose
N: O'Connor nods sympathetically. Actually he is praying that Ted won't start to cry.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Listen, don't let it get you down. You're going to be fine.
E: stiff upper lip doesn't believe it for a second
C: TED
D: Me? I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.

D: I'm going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
E: wishful thinking
C: O'CONNOR
D: She'll be back...
E: emphatically
N: Ted nods in agreement. There is a beat of silence as both men consider Joanna's imminent return. Then:
C: O'CONNOR
D: But... just in case... I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
E: trying to be tactful
C: TED
D: I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so... Pow  like that.
E: the wind goes out of him
C: O'CONNOR
D: Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while. Just until you get yourself straightened out.
E: a friend having to say something very difficult
C: TED
D: I don't know, Jim...
E: doubtfully
C: O'CONNOR
D: Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us  that's you and me  to deliver the goods. Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose 
E: the Dutch uncle
C: TED
D: Jim, I appreciate what you're saying. I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.

C: TED
D: Billy!
N: ON BILLY He sits in the living room watching television, a chocolate doughnut in one hand and a remote control device for watching television in the other. Off-screen Sound: a Saturday morning kiddie program from the television set.

C: TED
D: You got a letter from mom.
N: Instantly, Billy turns down the volume of the television.
C: BILLY
D: When is she coming home?!
E: excited
N: ON TED As he starts to read, slowly, carefully, so that Billy can absorb it.
C: TED
D: "My dear, sweet Billy: Mommy has gone away. Sometimes in the world daddies go away and mommies bring up their little boys. But sometimes a mommy can go away too, and you have your daddy to bring you up."
N: As Ted continues to read, Billy starts turning up the sound on the television, using the remote control device.
C: TED
D: "I have gone away because I must find some interesting things to do for myself in the world. Everybody has to, and so do I. Being your mommy was one thing, but there are other things and this is what I have to do. I did not get a chance to tell you this, and that is why I am writing you now."
E: raising his voice so he can be heard
N: By now the volume from the television is so loud that Ted has to shout to make himself heard over it.
C: TED
D: "I will always be your mommy and I will always love you. I just won't be your mommy in the house. But I will be your mommy of the heart. And I... " Billy.
E: he looks up, about to tell the child to lower the volume
N: HIS POV Billy sits, watching television with an almost ferocious intensity on his face, doing his best to block out Ted's voice. ON TED He watches his son for a second, then carefully refolds the letter, puts it away.

MEDIUM SHOT TED As he takes the cigarette box and balances it on a stack of scrap books, photographs, ash trays, etc., etc., that he is carrying.

Ted dumps the soiled clothing in a hamper, hangs up Billy's jacket, then he neatly folds the boy's sweater and crosses to the dresser. CLOSER IN ON THE DRESSER As Ted opens a drawer and starts to put the sweater away. Suddenly he spots something.
T: CUT TO:
N: HIS POV There, in the drawer, sitting on top of a pile of clothing is one of the photographs of Joanna that Ted put away this afternoon. Billy has retrieved it and hidden it here, hoping that Ted wouldn't find it. CLOSE ON TED As he takes a long look at the photograph, then turns to his son. HIS POV Billy asleep, tangled up in the covers. ON TED He removes the photograph from the drawer, crosses to the bed and places it on the nightstand nearby so that Billy will be able to see the picture of Joanna when he wakes up in the morning. He sits for a moment longer on the side of the bed and reaches across and smooths down his son's rumpled hair.

N: Note: The following scene, which is written as one, is actually to be played so that each time we cut back to the woman who is being interviewed as housekeeper, it is a different woman: sometimes nervous and excited, sometimes large and lugubrious, with six shopping bags, sometimes looking like a headmistress at Dachau. They are uniformly (until the last) unappetizing. Throughout this, we SEE Ted becoming increasingly desperate.
C: WOMAN

E: O.S.
N: ON TED He sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took from the office stacked beside him on the bench. Sitting next to him is a personable-looking man of about Ted's age. He is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and polished Gucci loafers. We will call him THE SATURDAY FATHER. Note: The Saturday Father and his daughter (a pretty young girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout the film. He is a divorced father, putting in his time, not giving a shit about the child. The Saturday Father insists on treating Ted as though they were members of the same secret fraternity. And he comes to represent Ted's nightmare of what might happen to him.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THE CHILDREN PUTTING ON THE SHOW AND TED KRAMER SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WATCHING: A look of total pleasure on his face. From time to time when Billy does something particularly difficult, Ted nudges the woman next to him. Note: In all of the shots of Billy we SEE the teacher there guiding, helping, over and over and over we cannot help but notice how attractive she is. Toward the end of the show Ted's POV occasionally follows the teacher rather than the child.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WIDE SHOT The show is over and the parents and children mill around eating popcorn, drinking lemonade from paper cups. Ted stands off to one side, talking to the teacher as Billy runs around. CLOSER IN ON THEM

D: Hello, Kramer.
N: ON TED He drops into a chair and shoves a stack of papers across the desk to her.
C: TED
D: Hiya, Phyllis. These are the Revlon contracts. I thought you ought to check them out.
C: PHYLLIS
D: Sure.
N: She takes the papers and starts to rifle through them, stopping every so often and making a note in the margin. As she does, we notice that the second and third buttons of her blouse have come undone and that she is not wearing a bra. CLOSER ON TED As he realizes this. ON PHYLLIS She glances up to ask Ted a question about some point or other, notices the direction of his gaze and, unself- consciously buttons up her blouse.

D: Kramer, I've got to go. I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
C: TED
D: Mmmmnph... I'll get you a cab...
E: half asleep
N: But he makes no move to get up. Phyllis gets to her feet and in the dim light we can SEE that, except for her glasses, she is naked.

C: PHYLLIS
D: Oh, God.
E: softly to herself
N: Too startled to cover herself. ON BILLY He looks her up and down, then:
C: BILLY
D: Do you like fried chicken?
E: very serious
N: ON PHYLLIS Suddenly remembering to cover herself.
C: PHYLLIS
D: Ah... Yes.
E: hoping desperately it is the right answer
N: SHOT  PHYLLIS AND BILLY
C: BILLY
D: So do I...
N: And he shuffles off to bed. Phyllis waits, frozen until he disappears into his room. Then, she turns and flees back into the bedroom.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM  NIGHT
N: ON PHYLLIS As she bursts into the room, closes the door behind her, leans against it.

C: TED
D: You ever think about getting married again?
C: THELMA
D: No, not really... I guess it's different if you don't have children, but... I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again... He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?" That's really true.
E: she thinks for a moment, then:
C: TED
D: How many onions does it say to use?
E: nodding toward a cookbook that is propped open nearby
C: THELMA

E: without bothering to look in the book
C: TED
D: D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
E: as he does
C: THELMA
D: No. I don't think so.
C: TED
D: C'mon, Thel. So Charley had a little fling. So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
C: THELMA
D: Look, I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay? I mean forget the logic part... But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.

S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT The Saturday Father and his daughter, clearly with nothing to say to one another, stand eating ices from a nearby vendor. THE CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM THEM across to Billy, Ted and Phyllis. She is dressed in a very nice suit, silk blouse, high heeled shoes and looks distinctly out of place in Central Park on a Saturday afternoon. At the moment, Ted is trying to teach Billy how to bat.
C: TED
D: Now look, you hold it like this... ...and you swing like this...
E: he places Billy's hands on the bat just so taking him through the motions
N: ON PHYLLIS Watching. She can't believe what she's seeing. Finally, she can't stand it any longer.

E: impatient
N: She crosses to Billy, gently takes the bat from him and demonstrates.
C: PHYLLIS
D: ...you hold it like this... Farther down the bat. And you swing like this... Throw me one.
E: showing him her grip to Ted
N: ON TED As he gives Billy a look that says, we have to humor her. He throws a ball. ON PHYLLIS As she swings, connects and slams a ball in a long, looping fly that goes at least two hundred feet. ON TED Watching the ball disappear in the distance, he turns back to Phyllis, open-mouthed. CLOSE ON PHYLLIS Embarrassed, she grins, shrugs and hands the bat back to Billy.

D: Okay, Jim. Here's the report on...
N: He stops in mid-sentence, looks around. HIS POV On the walls are a series of mock-ups of the various Fire and Ice ads, none of which are what Ted and O'Connor had agreed upon.
C: TED
D: What the hell is this?
E: surprised
C: O'CONNOR
D: Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs... I think they're kind of interesting.
E: innocent weakly
C: TED
D: I don't. Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about. It's not even close.
E: bugged
C: MURRAY
D: Ted, basically it's still your concept.
E: oily
C: O'CONNOR
D: Murray just added a few things, that's all.

C: O'CONNOR
D: It's for you.
N: ON TED As he takes the receiver.
C: TED
D: Yes?
E: puzzled
N: Then, embarrassed, he turns his back and lowers his voice.
C: TED
D: Look, Billy, I told you before, one hour of T.V. a day, that's the rule... No... I don't care what the other mothers do... Listen, I can't talk now, I'm in a meeting... Billy, I'll talk to you later, good- bye.
E: clearly, Billy is giving him an argument firm
N: Note: During the phone call, the CAMERA PANS AWAY to Murray & O'connor, looks of bored Condescension and smug superiority on their faces. Ted hangs up the phone and turns back around.
C: MURRAY
D: Ted, I appreciate what you're saying, but I really think you're just too close to it right now.
E: smooth
C: O'CONNOR
D: Murray's right. Look it's just some ideas, okay? I mean nothing's locked in cement. I promise you this is your show...

S: INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT
N: Ted is sitting at the dining room table, working. Spread out all across the table are layouts, rate sheets, etc., etc. Billy sits across from him drawing on a pad with felt-tipped pens. HOLD FOR A BEAT, then:

N: Silence.
C: BILLY
D: You get a new fence.
C: TED
D: C'mon, Billy. I'm trying to work for God's sake...
E: he hasn't heard a word
N: Another beat of silence, then Billy reaches for his glass of Hawaiian Punch and accidentally tips it over, spilling purple liquid across all of Ted's papers. Instantly, Ted is on his feet, yelling.

D: Goddamnit, can't you watch what you're doing!
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

E: sardonic noticing an important paper covered with grape juice
C: BILLY
D: I'm sorry.
E: starting to help
N: By now there is nothing the boy can do right.
C: TED
D: Look, it's after your bedtime, okay? Just do me a favor and go to bed, okay?
N: Billy gets to his feet, collects his stuff and walks into his bedroom. HOLD ON TED who sits for a moment, then gets wearily to his feet and as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM crosses to the door of Billy's room. He stops in the doorway, looks OFF SCREEN. HIS POV Billy struggling to get his pajamas on, having a hard time.
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
C: TED

D: That's okay...
S: INT. OFFICE  DAY
N: ON THE DOOR TO O'CONNOR'S OFFICE As it opens and Phyllis comes out. In the background in O'Connor's office we SEE O'Connor and Murray, talking, laughing. THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE Phyllis as she walks to Ted Kramer's office and opens the door without knocking.
C: PHYLLIS
D: How about lunch, Kramer. I'm buying.

N: The waiter bustles away.
C: TED
D: Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
C: PHYLLIS
D: Kramer...
N: She breaks off, uncertain whether or not to go on. Then, making up her mind, she reaches across, takes Ted's scotch and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp.
C: PHYLLIS
D: O'Connor's out to get you. He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
E: in a rush
C: TED
D: What?!?
E: stunned
N: Phyllis nods.
C: TED
D: I don't believe it! That's crazy! Why would Jim do something like that?
E: angry
N: Phyllis polishes off the rest of Ted's drink.
C: PHYLLIS
D: You want to know why? I'll tell you why... Another scotch and soda for the gentleman. I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore. Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
E: angry herself signaling to the waiter back to Ted
C: TED
D: I can't. I've got Billy to take care of.
C: PHYLLIS
D: You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy. All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
E: exasperated
C: TED
D: I don't believe you.
E: stiff
N: The waiter sets Ted's drink on the table in front of him. He starts to reach for it, but Phyllis is quicker.
C: PHYLLIS
D: All right. Okay. But tell me something, Kramer. Who do you think is palling around with O'Connor these days?
E: taking a stiff drink
N: Ted shrugs.
C: TED
D: How should I know?
C: PHYLLIS
D: Murray.
N: REACTION, TED Stunned, but trying to be nonchalant.
C: TED
D: So... what's so terrible about that?
C: PHYLLIS
D: Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being. Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout... Every idea... Every single thing, right down the line.
E: would like to take him by the shoulders and shake him until his teeth rattle leaning forward
C: TED
D: No. No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen. He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be  I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
C: PHYLLIS
D: Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying to do was 
E: apologetic for having upset Ted

S: INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY
N: O'Connor is alone in the office. He looks up startled as Ted comes barging in.
C: TED
D: All right, Jim. You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right? Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
E: furious brandishing the ad
C: O'CONNOR
D: Well, ah... I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
E: embarrassed
C: TED
D: Jim, this is garbage. This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about. None of it. You can't 

E: stubborn

D: I want a pizza.
E: sullen
C: TED
D: No. This is fine. Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
E: trying not to lose patience
N: Reluctantly, Billy takes a tiny bite. He barely puts it in his mouth before he spits it out with a great show of being physically ill.
C: BILLY
D: I think I'm going to throw up.
C: TED
D: Oh, for God's sake... Here.
E: getting pissed off
N: He reaches across and scrapes most of the sauce off of the meat.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KITCHEN  NIGHT
N: ON TED As he finishes doing the last of the dishes, dries his hands and looks around to make sure that everything has been put away. He flips off the light and, as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, he walks from room to room, turning off the lights, until he reaches the door to Billy's room which is still closed. Ted hesitates for a moment, then eases open the door and steps inside.

E: very quiet
N: ON TED Stunned at the question.
C: TED

N: There is a beat of silence, then:
C: BILLY
D: That's why mommy left... isn't it? 'Cause I was bad...
E: it comes pouring out
N: The boy begins to weep.
C: TED
D: Oh, Christ... Oh, Christ... No, pal. Your mom loves you very much. The reason she left didn't have anything to do with you. Look, I don't know if this will make any sense to you, okay? But I'll try and explain. You see the reason your mom left was because... Well, I guess it was because I kept trying to make her into a certain kind of person... Make her be the way I thought a wife was supposed to be. Only she wasn't like that. She was... Well, she wasn't like that. And now, when I think about it, I can see she tried very hard to be like I wanted  very hard. And when she couldn't, then she tried to tell me about it. Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I thought that if I was happy, that meant she was happy too. Only she wasn't. The truth is, the only reason she didn't leave a lot sooner was because she loves you so much. Joanna stayed until she couldn't stand me any longer and then she left... But it wasn't you, pal. It wasn't you.
E: he puts his arm around Billy and holds him close he thinks for a moment, then: pause, this is very painful smiles to himself
N: There is a long beat of silence as Billy thinks about this. Clearly an enormous burden has been lifted from his shoulders. Finally:

In the BACKGROUND we SEE Thelma and Kim chasing after him. THE LENGTH OF THE TRACKING SHOT SHOULD BE MUCH LONGER THAN WE EXPECT. IT SHOULD, IN FACT, COVER THE THREE CITY BLOCKS BETWEEN THE KRAMER APARTMENT AND THE HOSPITAL, ACROSS STREETS WITHOUT STOPPING FOR THE LIGHT, ALONG CROWDED SIDEWALKS WITHOUT STOPPING, ENDING FINALLY ON THE EMERGENCY ENTRANCE TO THE HOSPITAL.

Although we do not see the stitches being made, we do SEE the doctor's hand, with the needle and surgical thread as it moves into and out of view with a slow, steady rhythm. Billy's hand clutches Ted's so tightly that the knuckles are white.
C: BILLY
D: Ohhh... Ohhhh... Ohhhhh...

E: aghast
C: TED
D: I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should 
E: quickly
C: THELMA
D: Don't say that! I don't want to hear you say that!
E: deeply upset
C: TED

E: firmly correcting himself
C: THELMA
D: Me?! You want me to take care of Billy?!
E: amazed
C: TED
D: I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him. I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you. You're a good mother.
N: Silence. Thelma looks away from him.
C: TED
D: I know it's not an easy thing to answer.
E: hastily
N: Silence. She still cannot look at him.
C: TED
D: Look, if it's too much responsibility
N: Thelma nods, unable to speak.
C: TED
D: You're sure?
N: She nods again.
C: TED
D: Thank you, Thel. Thank you very much.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BILLY'S ROOM  EARLY MORNING
N: MEDIUM SHOT ON BILLY As he lies in bed asleep. Some time has passed and Billy's bandage is much smaller. HOLD ON HIM as we HEAR OFF SCREEN Sound: From the street below, the regular six-forty-five garbage truck that serves as Billy's alarm clock. HOLD ON BILLY As he wakes up, struggles to his feet. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as, eyes closed, he stumbles into the bathroom, pees, and still not remembering to flush the toilet walks into the bedroom and wakes his father. As the child turns and walks toward the kitchen, THE CAMERA HOLDS ON TED. He heaves himself to his feet and, eyes closed, in much the same manner as his son, stumbles into the bathroom. He automatically flushes the toilet without bothering to look, walks into the living room, opens the front door and picks up the paper. As he starts into the kitchen, he meets Billy coming the other way carrying two plates, a doughnut on each. THE CAMERA NOW TRACKS WITH BILLY as he walks into the living room, carefully sets the plates on the dining table, crosses to the television set, and turns it on. He returns to the table, and sits down as Ted appears carrying two glasses of orange juice and vitamins. He takes a seat in the chair opposite Billy and opens his paper and starts to read. HOLD ON THEM as they sit without talking, eating their breakfast  the only sound, a children's cartoon program coming from the T.V. From time to time Ted glances up from his paper to look across at the cartoon. HOLD ON THEM as we SEE that they have become roommates in the best sense of the word.
S: EXT. TED'S OFFICE BLDG.  MIDTOWN  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT It is a gray, cloudy day in mid-November. Snow is falling. Sound-effect: a telephone ringing. Then:
C: TED'S VOICE
D: Hello?
C: JOANNA'S VOICE
D: Ted?
C: TED'S VOICE
D: Joanna?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RESTAURANT, ISLE OF CAPRI  NIGHT
N: ON THE DOOR As Ted enters, looks around. The Maitre d'hotel approaches. From his attitude, it is clear that Ted and Joanna were regular customers.
C: MAITRE D'HOTEL
D: Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven't seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer, she waits for you in the back.
C: TED
D: Thank you, John.
N: THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he walks toward the back room of the restaurant. Several waiters approach and say hello, the piano player looks up and smiles. As he reaches the door to the back room.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BACK ROOM
N: TED'S POV  JOANNA She sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of her. She is dressed simply and no longer has a tan. Nevertheless, Joanna is still stunningly beautiful. HOLD ON HER FOR A BEAT as she looks up, smiles. ON TED He stands watching her, his knees weak. It is impossible not to fall in love with her all over again. TWO SHOT As he crosses to her table, sits down.
C: JOANNA
D: Hello, Ted. You look well.
C: TED
D: So do you.
N: The waiter appears, carrying a scotch and soda. He sets it down on the table in front of Ted.
C: WAITER
D: The usual, Mr. Kramer.
C: TED
D: Thanks, Gino.
E: not taking his eyes off Joanna
N: The waiter nods and promptly disappears.
C: JOANNA
D: How's the new job?
C: TED
D: Fine.
N: There is a self-conscious pause. From the bar, the piano player begins playing a new song. From Ted and Joanna's reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal to them in the past. They listen for a moment, then:
C: TED
D: Look at us, Joanna. Just like any old married couple having dinner. Who would believe it.
C: JOANNA
D: Yes... How's Billy?
N: ON TED The question he has been dreading.
C: TED
D: He's great... except... ...Except he had... he fell and he cut his face. He... He has a scar, Joanna, from about here to here.
E: not looking at her indicating where and how big
N: There is a beat of silence. A moment of shared feeling.
C: TED
D: I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault. I keep thinking I could've done something  stopped it...
E: he has to say it to someone
C: JOANNA
D: You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
N: For the first time he looks up at her.
C: TED
D: What?
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
C: JOANNA
D: I've seen him.
C: TED
D: You have?
C: JOANNA
D: A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
N: ON TED Speechless.
C: JOANNA
D: He looks like a terrific kid.
C: TED
D: He is... You sat in that coffee shop across from school 
E: he still can't get over it
C: JOANNA
D: Watching my son... Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
E: completing the sentence
C: TED
D: You've been living here, in the city?
E: amazed
C: JOANNA
D: Ted... The reason I wanted to see you... I want Billy back.
E: a deep breath
C: TED
D: You want what?!
C: JOANNA
D: I want my son. I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
E: firm
C: TED
D: Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, listen to me... You and I, we had a really crappy marriage  Look, don't get so defensive, okay? It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up 
E: trying to explain hastily
C: TED
D: Joanna, I don't give a 
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty- two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child. I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get. Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink. Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
E: she will be heard leaning forward, very sincere
C: TED
D: Such as?
E: like a shot
N: Silence.
C: TED
D: Come on, Joanna, what did you learn? I'd really like to know.
E: boring in
N: Silence.
C: TED
D: One thing, okay? Just tell me one goddam thing you've learned.
E: relentless
N: There is a beat of silence, then:
C: JOANNA
D: I've learned that I want my son.
E: quiet, determined
N: ON TED He reacts as though he has been slapped.
C: TED
D: Joanna, go be a mother. Get married, have kids. Don't get married, have kids. Do whatever you want. I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it  and leave my baby out of it.
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally -
C: TED
D: Joanna, go fuck yourself!
E: getting to his feet
N: And with that he turns on his heels and stalks out of the restaurant.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT A large, very plush office: lots of antiques, beautiful nineteenth century paintings on the wall along with autographed photographs of at least three ex-Presidents of the United States. Sitting behind a large and imposing desk is JOHN SHAUNESSY, a handsome, formidable man in his early sixties. He is well-dressed, a cornflower in his buttonhole, that sort of thing. At the moment, Shaunessy leans back in his chair as Ted finishes his story.
C: TED
D: Look, she walked out on her own child, right? That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
E: leaning forward, intense
C: SHAUNESSY
D: First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved. Got it?
N: Ted nods.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Second, the burden is on us to prove your ex-wife is an unfit mother. That means I'm going to have to play rough and, if I play rough, you can bet they will too. Can you take that, Mr. Kramer?
N: Ted nods.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Third, it'll cost you five thousand dollars.
N: REACTION TED That's an astronomical amount of money to him.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: That's if we win. If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
C: TED
D: Fine.
E: determined
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Good. You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?
E: down to business
C: TED
D: Six.
N: ON SHAUNESSY He shakes his head.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: That's tough. In most cases involving a child that young, the court tends to side with the mother.
N: ON TED Agitated. This is not what he wanted to hear.
C: TED
D: But she signed over custody. Here...
N: He digs in his pockets, pulls out a piece of paper and thrusts it at the lawyer.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: I'm not saying we don't have a shot, but it won't be easy... Mr. Kramer, do me a favor. There is something I find very helpful in matters like this. I sit down and make a list of all the pros and cons on an issue. I actually write them down and look at them. I want you to do that, okay? Then, after that, if you're really sure you want to retain custody of your child  then we'll go in there and whip their asses.
E: glancing at it thinks for a moment
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  LATE AT NIGHT
N: WIDE SHOT Ted sits at the dining table, the supper dishes have been pushed aside. He has a legal pad in front of him and is writing. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN CLOSER. INSERT  TED'S POV The legal pad. On one side Ted has written "Pro" and on the other, "Con." Underneath "Con" Ted has written a long list of the drawbacks involved in keeping Billy: Sex Life, Money, Possibility of Remarriage, Sleep, Emotional Dependence. The "Pro" side of the list is empty. ON TED He sits for a moment, staring at the list, then he crumples the paper, gets to his feet.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT
N: ON THE DOOR As Ted enters. He crosses to Billy's bed where the child is fast asleep, sits down on the edge, and starts to rub the child's back.

C: BILLY
D: I love you too daddy.
E: half-asleep
N: Ted kisses the child, gets to his feet and starts toward the door.

E: almost asleep again
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT O'Connor stands with his back to Ted, looking out the window. From the beginning this is clearly an awkward and unpleasant moment.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Look, ah... Ted. I just got word from the guys at Revlon and... ah they did some marketing tests on our campaign and the results were...
E: scared to do what he is about to do
N: CLOSE ON TED Hold on him listening as it slowly dawns on him that he is being fired.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Disappointing. It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty five minimum, and... ah... they're not very happy and... Well, the guys have decided they want to... ah, re-think the entire concept and... Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But... I mean, what I mean is... ah, I'm going to have to... ah, let you go 
E: stiff
C: TED
D: Are you firing me, Jim?
E: not really sure he heard right
N: ON O'CONNOR He still has his back to Ted.
C: O'CONNOR
D: C'mon, Ted, don't get emotional. Okay? Look, this isn't exactly an easy thing for me to do, y'know? I swear Murray and I did everything we could, but those sons of bitches were out for blood. I mean it was all I could do to keep the account inside the shop... Look, I promise, if I hear of anything I'll let you know first thing.
E: whining
N: Ted, I want  O'Connor looks around.
C: O'CONNOR

E: glancing at a form Ted has filled out the good news the bad news
C: TED

E: panic
C: INTERVIEWER
D: Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.

AS THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN CLOSER, he hangs up the receiver and takes the employment section of the New York Times which is filled with listings he has circled and crosses off one.

E: going through the motions
N: Finally he pauses at one card, pulls it out.
C: INTERVIEWER
D: There might be something at J. Walter Thompson. But... ...I don't think they're really serious. The position's been open for two months and... They may just be on a fishing expedition. I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first 
E: doubtfully shaking his head shrugs cheerful
C: TED
D: Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson. Set up an appointment at four.

S: INT. OFFICE ADVERTISING MANAGER, J. WALTER THOMPSON  LATE
N: AFTERNOON It is dark outside and the lights are on in the office. From beyond the door, we can hear the sounds of a Christmas office party in full swing. ON JACK ACKERMAN The advertising manager. A balding man in his mid-forties, he wears a suit, complete with vest. At the moment he sits behind his desk listening to Ted's spiel, from time to time he glances at the resume on the desk in front of him.
C: TED
D: So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see from my resume, my experience in setting up the leisure package concept means that I've spent a lot of time working along the same lines as your multiple buys and your regional advertising ideas. I know the pitfalls, but  and this is more important  I know the potential revenue for the company inherent in these programs.
E: O.S.
N: ON TED As he finishes. He sits back, pleased with himself.
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
C: ACKERMAN
D: Well, Mr. Kramer, I must say this has been very impressive. I'd like to think about it and get back to you.
C: TED
D: Mr. Ackerman, is there anyone else that I should see before you come to a decision.
E: leaning forward
C: ACKERMAN
D: Mr. Spencer, our Advertising Director.
C: TED
D: Could I see him right away?
E: no time to waste
C: ACKERMAN
D: I'm sorry, but he's leaving this evening for a two-week vacation. I'll set up something the moment he gets back.
E: taken aback
N: He gets to his feet, starts to shake Ted's hand, ready to end the interview.
C: TED
D: I'd like to see him now  before he leaves.
C: ACKERMAN
D: Mr. Kramer, I don't think 
C: TED

N: He turns and goes out the door.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OUTER OFFICE, J. WALTER THOMPSON  LATE AFTERNOON
N: The large room is crowded with secretaries, junior executives, researchers, editors, ad-men, etc., etc. They all have drinks in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general conviviality going on. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH ACKERMAN as he steps out of his office, closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room to MR. SPENCER, the Advertising Director. At the moment, Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his hand talking to a very pretty young woman. Ackerman approaches him, whispers something in his ear. Spencer shakes his head and points to his watch. Ackerman says something else and finally, with a look of weary resignation, Spencer excuses himself from the pretty young woman and follows Ackerman back to his office. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM. As Ackerman opens the door to his office, THE CAMERA IS ANGLED so that we can SEE past them, into the office where Ted stands waiting.
C: ACKERMAN
D: Mr. Spencer, Mr. Kramer.
E: as they enter
C: SPENCER
D: So you're the go-getter. All right, you've got ten minutes.

C: SPENCER
D: That's very interesting, Mr. Kramer. I must say, it's very interesting. Let me think about it. I'll let Jack... ...know and he'll get in touch with you.
E: sipping his drink indicating Ackerman
N: Spencer gets to his feet, starts to retrieve his coat. ON TED As he decides to take a gamble.
C: TED
D: Excuse me, I believe you said I had ten minutes.
N: ON SPENCER Almost at the door, looking around.
C: SPENCER
D: Well?
N: ON TED Checking his watch.
C: TED
D: That means I've got two minutes left. I understand you're paying twenty- five.
N: Spencer nods.
C: TED
D: All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do  I'll take the job at twenty- two-five. Now, that's twenty-five hundred less than you're offering. The only thing is, you have to say yes right now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not after the holidays. It's worth it to me for a yes right now and I'll take twenty-five hundred less.
E: a deep breath, then a real huckster
N: There is a long beat of silence as Spencer and Ackerman look at one another. They were clearly not prepared for this.
C: TED
D: Today only. One day only. Twenty-two five.
E: watching them
C: SPENCER
D: Mr. Kramer, can we talk privately for a moment?
C: TED
D: Certainly.
T: CUT TO:
N: OUTER OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON ON TED As he steps out of Ackerman's office, sits down. Now, all of the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up. What if he pushed too hard? What will he do if he doesn't get a job? If Ted Kramer could fall to his knees and pray, he would.
T: CROSS-CUT WITH THE CHRISTMAS PARTY
N: That swirls around him. We notice in particular, one very pretty young woman flirting with a number of men. She is wearing a dress with straps, one of them has broken and she has patched it with a piece of masking tape. Finally the door to Ackerman's office opens and he steps out.
C: ACKERMAN
D: Mr. Kramer?
N: Ted jumps to his feet, starts into the office.

C: TED
D: Well, gentlemen, I'm pleased to be with you.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE As they shake hands, say their good-byes. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he makes his way through the Christmas party that is still going strong. Then, suddenly, as he passes the very pretty woman we noticed earlier, he turns and kisses her.
T: QUICK CUTS

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET  DAY
N: ON A BUS As it pulls to a stop, the doors open and, along with the usual flood of mothers and children we SEE Ted and Billy. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they walk to school. Billy is talking a mile a minute, describing in minute detail the plot of an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie." Ted listens intently, then, almost involuntarily, he glances over his shoulder in the direction of the Coffee Shop. HIS POV There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna. ON TED AND BILLY As they continue to walk. Ted's eyes remain on Joanna. As they reach the door to the school, Ted looks at his son.
C: TED
D: You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer.
E: kissing Billy goodbye

C: TED
D: John, what if she kidnaps him. I've heard all these 
E: agitated
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
E: the patience of a saint
C: TED
D: I don't know, John... I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now. Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
E: doubtful

D: You ever see her talk to the walls?
E: a flicker of interest

TED'S POV  TRACKING FORWARD About half a block away Joanna paces back and forth. She hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as they are. ANOTHER ANGLE ON TED AND BILLY Ted stops, turns to Billy and gives him a last-minute check. Then, spotting a smudge he takes his handkerchief, spits on it and wipes the child's chin. Now satisfied, he takes Billy's hand and they continue. Suddenly: CLOSEUP BILLY As he spots his mother.
C: BILLY
D: Mommy!
T: QUICK CUT: JOANNA
N: As she turns, spots Billy, starts to run. ON BILLY TRACKING WITH HIM as he lets go of Ted's hand and starts to run flat out toward his mother. She kneels, opens her arms wide for him and he goes barreling into her, almost knocking her down from the impact.

E: somewhere between laughter and tears
N: WIDER SHOT Joanna gets to her feet and takes Billy's hand.
C: JOANNA

T: FADE TO BLACK:
N: WIDE SHOT Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look like a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted is busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt. Phyllis is getting undressed also, hanging things in the closet, putting things away in drawers. But as Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is clear that something is wrong.
C: TED
D: So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
E: he has become an armchair lawyer
C: PHYLLIS
D: Right.
E: thoughtful
C: TED
D: But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969  in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
C: PHYLLIS
D: Kramer 
C: TED
D: Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
C: PHYLLIS
D: Kramer... There's something I ought to tell you.
C: TED
D: Yeah?
C: PHYLLIS
D: I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
N: CLOSE ON TED He stops what he is doing, turns to her.
C: TED
D: And?
C: PHYLLIS
D: I'm going to take it.
E: a deep breath
N: REACTION  TED He sits down on the bed.
C: PHYLLIS
D: It's a very good job  too good to pass up. I'll be handling funding for the whole... Look, I... ..."like" you a lot. And you... ..."like" me, okay? Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
E: she stops, sits beside him on the bed she means love she means love
C: TED
D: But it's not a year from now, is it?
E: quiet
N: She shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him.
C: PHYLLIS
D: I'll miss you, Kramer...
S: INT. KRAMER APT.  DAY
N: ON THE FRONT DOOR It is open and standing in the doorway is an attractive woman, a bit overweight and very serious. This is DR. ALVAREZ, the court appointed psychiatrist.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Mr. Kramer?
C: TED
D: Yes?
C: ALVAREZ
D: I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
C: TED
D: Oh, yes. Won't you come in.
N: Dr. Alvarez enters the apartment. Ted helps her off with her coat.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Where is the child?
C: TED
D: He's in his room, playing.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Good. I'll see him in there.
N: As Ted carries her coat to the closet, Dr. Alvarez walks into the living room, looks around.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
C: TED
D: Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one.
T: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
C: ALVAREZ
D: Does that distress you?
C: TED
D: Not particularly.
C: ALVAREZ
D: What does?
C: TED
D: The prospect of losing my child.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
E: makes some notes, then:
N: They cross to the door of Billy's room. Ted opens it.
S: INT. BILLY'S ROOM  DAY
N: THEIR POV The room is a mess, blocks are stacked everywhere. Billy sits in the middle playing with his toys. ON TED AND DR. ALVAREZ They stand in the doorway.
C: TED
D: Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
C: BILLY
D: Sure.
E: looking up from his toys
N: There is an awkward pause as Ted remains in the doorway.
C: DR. ALVAREZ
D: I'd like to talk to Billy privately.
E: pointedly
C: TED
D: Oh, yeah...
E: embarrassed at being caught
N: Reluctantly, Ted leaves, closing the door behind him. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he crosses the living room to the couch where he has a stack of legal books and a number of note pads spread out. He is obviously continuing his legal education. THROUGH OUT THE FOLLOWING, THE CAMERA REMAINS ON HIS FACE.
C: ALVAREZ
D: What do you have here, Billy?
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: Detroit.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Have you ever been to Detroit?
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: No. But I've been to Brooklyn.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: I see you have people there. What are their names?
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: That's Kim... and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: What about your mommy?
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Do you like to be with your mommy?
E: O.S.
N: Ted by now has given up all pretense of working. He wags his pencil in the direction of the door.
C: TED
D: Objection. You're leading the witness.
E: the defense attorney
C: BILLY
D: Sure.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: What do you like best about her?
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: Lunch in a restaurant.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: What do you like best about your daddy?
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: Playing.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
E: O.S.
N: REACTION  TED Eyes wide. He starts to get up.
C: TED
D: Objection.
C: BILLY
D: Sure. Lots of times.
E: O.S.
N: This brings Ted all the way to his feet. He starts across the living room headed for the door to Billy's room.
C: ALVAREZ
D: When does he hit you?
E: O.S. interested
N: Ted has his hand on the doorknob, about to enter.
C: BILLY
D: He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
E: O.S.
C: ALVAREZ
D: In real life when does he hit you?
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
E: O.S. laughing

S: EXT. MODERN OFFICE BUILDING, MIDTOWN  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT It is a Saturday afternoon. HOLD FOR A BEAT as we SEE Ted Kramer and Billy approaching. Billy is talking a mile a minute. Ted listens intently, absorbed in the boy's description. As they turn into the entrance of the office building:
S: INT. CORRIDOR, J. WALTER THOMPSON  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT A long corridor with desks for secretaries lined up next to doors leading to smaller individual offices. As they approach a door in the foreground that bears a small sign reading, "Ted Kramer":
C: TED
D: See. That's my name.
E: interrupting Billy, who is still in the middle of his story
C: BILLY
D: It's my name too.
E: looking at the sign
C: TED
D: Right.
N: As he opens the door:
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TED KRAMER'S OFFICE  DAY
N: It is a pleasant enough office, but nothing spectacular, windows that look out over Fifty-seventh Street, simple Formica furniture, that sort of thing. ON THE DOOR As they enter.
C: BILLY
D: Wow!
E: he stops dead in his tracks at the sight of the office
C: TED
D: You like it?
E: pleased
N: Billy crosses to the window, presses his nose to the glass, looks out.
C: BILLY
D: Wow! Is this really where you work?
N: Ted nods, walks over to the desk and begins collecting paperwork to do over the weekend. As he does, Billy goes through the office, sitting in every chair, looking in every drawer.
C: BILLY
D: Is this really your desk?
C: TED
D: Yep.
C: BILLY
D: Is that really your chair?
C: TED
D: Uh huh...
C: BILLY
D: Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it?
C: TED
D: Sure.
N: Billy plops himself down in Ted's chair, swivels around.
C: BILLY
D: Did mommy ever see this?
C: TED
D: No, she never did.
C: BILLY
D: Are you going to get remarried?
C: TED
D: I don't know. I hadn't thought much about it.
C: BILLY
D: Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
C: TED
D: No.
E: shaking his head
N: CLOSE ON BILLY There is a long pause, then:
C: BILLY
D: Will you and mommy get remarried?
N: Ted stops what he is doing, looks across at Billy:
C: TED
D: No, son. Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
C: BILLY
D: Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
E: looking around Ted's office
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM  VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING
N: CLOSE ON AN ALARM CLOCK THAT SITS ON A NIGHTSTAND As it rings, THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS and we SEE Joanna sitting in bed wide awake, smoking. As she puts out the cigarette she has been smoking and starts to get out of bed,
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KITCHEN  TED KRAMER'S APT.  EARLY MORNING
N: ON TED Who stands with a cup of coffee in his hands, looking out the window, but not seeing anything. HOLD FOR A BEAT, then he checks his watch and starts for the bedroom.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. JOANNA'S BEDROOM  MORNING
N: ON JOANNA As she selects a very conservative suit from her closet.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BILLY KRAMER'S BEDROOM  MORNING

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING
N: Joanna sits across from her lawyer as he talks to her, intently, giving her last-minute instructions.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET  MORNING
N: ON TED KRAMER Taking Billy to school. They stop at the entrance, Ted kisses his son good-bye and stands for a moment watching as the boy runs into the building.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COURTHOUSE  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT It is a bleak January morning, the streets around the courthouse are mobbed with people on their way to work. We SEE Ted Kramer, a tiny figure among hundreds, coming out of the subway. He crosses the street and starts up the steps of the large and forbidding courthouse.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COURTHOUSE  DAY
N: WIDE SHOT As Ted gets off the elevator and starts down the corridor, toward the courtroom. In the f.g.,  standing by the door of the courtroom itself is John Shaunessy, he greets Ted, they shake hands and talk together for a moment. Then, as they enter the courtroom:
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COURTROOM
N: ON THE DOOR As Ted enters, looks around. Mrs. Willewska sits in one of the back rows, wearing her best Easter hat. Ted pauses by her, thanks her for coming. Several rows in front of her is Thelma. Ted crosses to her, they talk quietly between themselves for a few moments. Then Ted moves on to a table at the front of the room where John Shaunessy waits. ON THE DOORS AT THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM As they swing open and Joanna, along with her lawyer, a MR. GRESSEN. THE CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as they walk to the front of the room and take their seats at the table opposite Ted and his lawyer.
C: CLERK
D: Oyez, oyez... The third Circuit Court of the State of New York, Judge Atkins presiding is now in session. All rise...
N: WIDE SHOT As the judge enters, takes his seat. Opening business of the court. WIDE SHOT As Gressen (Joanna's lawyer) gets to his feet.
C: GRESSEN
D: Your honor. As our first witness I would like to call Joanna Kramer.
N: TWO SHOT  TED AND SHAUNESSY The lawyer leans across to Ted.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Real direct. Motherhood... They're going right for the throat.
E: stage whisper
N: WIDE SHOT As Joanna gets to her feet, crosses to the witness stand and is sworn in. Note: Throughout the following, we continually CROSS-CUT to Ted Kramer, leaning forward, listening intently. It becomes evident that, in spite of himself, there are moments he feels great compassion for Joanna.
C: GRESSEN
D: Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
C: JOANNA
D: Six years.
C: GRESSEN
D: And would you describe those years as happy?
C: JOANNA
D: The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
C: GRESSEN
D: Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
C: JOANNA
D: No, I did not.
C: GRESSEN
D: Did you wish to?
C: JOANNA
D: Yes. I tried to talk to Ted  my ex- husband  about it, but he wouldn't listen. He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby-sitter for Billy.
C: GRESSEN
D: Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
C: JOANNA
D: Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
C: GRESSEN
D: And what is your present salary?
C: JOANNA
D: I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
N: REACTION  TED Stunned.
C: GRESSEN
D: Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
E: switching tactics
C: JOANNA
D: Yes. Very much.
E: emphatically
C: GRESSEN
D: And yet you chose to leave him?
N: There is a long pause, then:
C: JOANNA
D: Yes... Look, during the last five years we were married, I had... I was getting more and more... unhappy, more and more frustrated. I needed to talk to somebody. I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what. But every time I turned to Ted  my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it. He became very... I don't know, very threatened. I mean, whenever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack. Anyway, we became more and more separate... more and more isolated from one another. Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex- husband's attitude  his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self-esteem... At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me  that my son would be better off without me. It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person. And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
E: speaking carefully, with great thought with feeling
C: GRESSEN
D: Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
E: to the judge
N: And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick sheaf of papers. Then, turning his attention back to Joanna:
C: GRESSEN
D: Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
C: JOANNA
D: Because my son is here. And his father is here. As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
C: GRESSEN
D: Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
N: There is a pause, then:
C: JOANNA
D: Because he's my child... Because I love him. I know I left my son, I know that's a terrible thing to do. Believe me, I have to live with that every day of my life. But just because I'm a woman, don't I have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man? Don't I have a right to a life of my own? Is that so awful? Is my pain any less just because I'm a woman? Are my feelings any cheaper? I left my child  I know there is no excuse for that. But since then, I have gotten help. I have worked hard to become a whole human being. I don't think I should be punished for that. I don't think my son should be punished for that. Billy's only six. He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't need his father, but he needs me more. I'm his mother.
N: There is a beat of silence, then:
C: GRESSEN
D: Thank you, Mrs. Kramer. I have no further questions.
N: ON SHAUNESSY As he stands, collects his papers from the table and, taking his own sweet time, crosses to Joanna.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
C: JOANNA
D: Yes.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
C: JOANNA
D: No.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
C: JOANNA
D: No.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
C: JOANNA
D: No.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: A heavy drinker?
C: JOANNA
D: No.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Was he unfaithful?
C: JOANNA
D: No.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Did he ever fail to provide for you?
C: JOANNA
D: No.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
E: wry smile
C: GRESSEN
D: Objection.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
E: switching his line of questioning
C: JOANNA
D: Permanently.
N: Note: During the early part of Shaunessy's cross-examination, Joanna has been very forthright, very sure of herself. Now, as he starts getting tougher, she begins to falter.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Permanently? Mrs. Kramer, how many boy friends have you had  permanently?
E: smiles, like a shark smiles
N: ON JOANNA Her head snaps back as though she's been hit.
C: JOANNA
D: I don't recall.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: How many lovers have you had  permanently?
E: boring in
C: JOANNA
D: I don't recall.
E: looks toward Gressen for help
C: SHAUNESSY
D: More than three, less than thirty- three  permanently?
N: ON GRESSEN He is again on his feet, outraged.
C: GRESSEN
D: Objection!
C: JUDGE
D: Overruled. The witness will answer, please.
C: JOANNA
D: Somewhere in between.
E: almost a whisper
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Do you have a lover now?
C: GRESSEN
D: Objection!
E: furious
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question. Does she have a lover?
E: to the judge
C: JUDGE
D: I'll allow that. The witness will answer please.
C: JOANNA
D: Yes.
E: in a whisper
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Is that... permanent?
C: JOANNA
D: I... I don't know...
E: by now she is becoming thoroughly rattled
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
N: ON THE PETITIONER'S TABLE Gressen jumps to his feet.
C: GRESSEN
D: Objection! I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
C: JUDGE
D: Sustained.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
E: a new attack
C: GRESSEN
D: Objection!
E: red in the face
C: JUDGE
D: Sustained.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: I'll ask it another way. What was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life  other than parents and girlfriends?
C: JOANNA
D: Ah... I guess I'd have to say... with my child.
E: rattled
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
E: wonder, irony
C: JOANNA
D: I suppose...
E: reluctantly
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
C: JOANNA
D: Yes.
E: louder
C: SHAUNESSY
D: How long was that?
C: JOANNA
D: We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
C: GRESSEN
D: Objection!
C: JUDGE
D: Overruled.
C: JOANNA
D: I was not a failure.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Oh? What do you call it then  a success? The marriage ended in divorce.
E: sarcastic
C: JOANNA
D: I consider it less my failure than his.
E: so angry she forgets her cool
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law. You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
E: seizes on this
C: GRESSEN
D: Objection!
E: on his feet
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at? Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
E: to the judge to Joanna
N: CLOSE ON JOANNA Who sits silently.
C: JUDGE
D: Please answer the question, Mrs. Kramer.
C: JOANNA
D: It did not succeed.
E: whisper
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Not it... Not it, Mrs. Kramer  you. Were you a failure at the most important personal relationship of your life?
E: suddenly fierce
N: CLOSER IN ON JOANNA Silence.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Were you?
N: EXTREME CLOSEUP JOANNA
C: JOANNA
D: Yes.
E: barely audible
N: WIDE SHOT Shaunessy smiles, turns his back on Joanna and walks back toward the respondent's table.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: No further questions.
N: CLOSER IN ON THE TABLE As Shaunessy sits down next to Ted.
C: TED
D: Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so rough on her?
E: leaning over, in a whisper
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Do you want the kid or don't you?
E: tough
N: ON JOANNA Shaken, she gets down from the witness stand, crosses to the petitioner's table without looking at Ted. She sits, leans across to her lawyer and whispers something in his ear. As he nods...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COURTROOM, LATER IN THE DAY
N: ON JIM O'CONNOR Who sits in the witness stand. At the moment he is being examined by Gressen.
C: GRESSEN
D: Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
C: O'CONNOR
D: Eight, almost nine years.
C: GRESSEN
D: And did you have a close personal relationship?
C: O'CONNOR
D: Yes...
E: in a whisper
C: GRESSEN
D: And how did you find his work?
C: O'CONNOR
D: It was good. He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
C: GRESSEN
D: And yet you fired him.
N: There is a long pause.
C: O'CONNOR
D: Ted was a good worker. But, ah... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that. I've got problems, everybody's got problems. But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way... I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
E: looking down quietly
C: GRESSEN
D: Thank you. I have no further questions.
N: Shaunessy stands up.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Mr. O'Connor, does the agency still have the Fire and Ice account?
C: O'CONNOR
D: No.
E: up tight
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Mr. O'Connor, can you tell me where you are employed at the moment?
C: O'CONNOR
D: At the moment I am unemployed.
E: stiff

N: ESTABLISHING SHOT
S: INT. COURTROOM  DAY
N: ON THELMA She sits in the witness stand being examined by Shaunessy. From her attitude it is clear that she is very wrought up, that all of this is taking a heavy emotional toll on her.

D: Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
C: THELMA
D: Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
C: THELMA

E: to the judge, by way of explanation
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
C: THELMA
D: It's beautiful. It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.

D: Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
C: THELMA
D: Ted  Mr. Kramer, spends a great deal of time with his child. I don't just mean hours, I mean good time, involved time. He reads to Billy. They play together. They talk all the time... He is a very... kind man... a very... devoted father, and... and... And Joanna if you ever saw them together... there wouldn't be a trial at all... Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

D: When Joanna   my ex-wife  when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage... Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true. There were a lot of things I didn't understand  a lot of things I would do different if I could. Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change... But we can't. Some things, once they are done, can't be undone. Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe she does. So do I. But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue. The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy... When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right. But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex? I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent: constancy, patience, understanding... love. Where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman? Billy has a home with me, I've tried to make it the best I could. It's not perfect. I'm not a perfect parent. I don't have enough patience. Sometimes I forget he's just a little kid... But I love him... More than anything in this world I love him.
E: speaking quietly to the judge, correcting himself unconsciously echoing something Joanna said earlier
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Thank you, Mr. Kramer. No further questions.
N: ON GRESSEN As he gets up from the petitioner's table and crosses to the witness stand.
C: GRESSEN
D: Mr. Kramer, by any chance have you ever had a woman in your bed while your child was asleep in the next room?
E: hard-lining it
C: TED
D: I suppose.
C: GRESSEN
D: So do I.
E: pointedly
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Objection!
C: JUDGE
D: Sustained.
C: GRESSEN
D: Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
E: switching to another line of attack
C: TED
D: Technically, the agency lost a big account and seventy four people were let go. I was one of them.
E: not losing his cool
C: GRESSEN
D: You were fired, correct?
E: snotty
C: TED
D: Yes, but I'm with J. Walter Thompson now. I don't think that will happen again.
C: GRESSEN
D: Give them time...
E: snide
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Objection, your honor! Counsel is harassing the witness.
C: GRESSEN
D: Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record. He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
E: to the judge, pettish
C: JUDGE
D: Sustained.
N: ON GRESSEN He is thoughtful for a moment, like a man trying to decide whether or not to drop the bomb. Then, turning back to Ted:
C: GRESSEN
D: Mr. Kramer, did your child nearly lose an eye when he was in your care?
E: very tough
N: REACTION  TED Stunned. He looks across at Joanna.
T: QUICK CUT  HIS POV
N: Joanna looks away.
C: GRESSEN
D: Mr. Kramer, did you, or did you not tell the child's mother that you were responsible for the injury that permanently disfigured your child?
E: boring in
N: Shaunessy is on his feet racing toward the bench.
C: SHAUNESSY
D: Objection! Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
E: vehement
C: GRESSEN
D: While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
E: to the judge
C: JUDGE
D: Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
E: to Gressen
C: GRESSEN
D: Yes, your honor.
C: JUDGE
D: I see. Well, you'll have to do better than that. Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
C: GRESSEN
D: I do not, your honor, however 
C: JUDGE
D: This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
C: GRESSEN
D: Does the witness deny the injury took place?
E: back to Ted
C: JUDGE
D: No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
E: before Ted can say anything
C: GRESSEN
D: Then I have concluded my questions.

D: At times, in the night he will have nightmares, one particular monster is called The Face.

C: TED
D: Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father. Now there is a man who is very wise. He's called a judge. And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
C: BILLY
D: Why does he decide?
C: TED
D: Because... Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man.
C: BILLY
D: Like a principal?
C: TED
D: Bigger than a principal. The judge sits in robes in a big chair... The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided... ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment. And I'm very lucky. Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
E: a deep breath fake cheerful

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KRAMER KITCHEN  MORNING
N: ON TED AND BILLY They stand side by side, like a surgeon and his assistant. Spread out on the counter in front of them are the makings of French toast. The following is done with great efficiency, in contrast to the first time we saw them go through the same ritual. They work in silence except for an occasional command. Each concentrating on this last moment of closeness, each doing his best to avoid thinking about Billy's departure. Finally: ON BILLY Looking at his father, trying to memorize the older man's face. Ted turns, sees his son watching him.

C: JOANNA
D: Ted, do you love him?

D: Goddamnit, Joanna. What the 
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, do you love him?
E: insistent
N: He nods.
C: JOANNA
D: I love him too... I don't think I ever knew how much until now.
N: There is a long pause as she looks at Ted, unable to speak. Finally:
C: JOANNA
D: Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and... when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby... and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and 
E: a deep breath, then:
C: TED
D: Joanna, what the hell is 
C: JOANNA
D: Please... Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
E: urgent
N: ON TED Struck by the urgency in her voice.
C: JOANNA
D: After I left... when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy  I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me. Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him... And I did... And I won. Only... it was just another "should." ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened. I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy. I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
E: she begins to break down
C: TED
D: What?
E: stunned
C: JOANNA
D: He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two... He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
E: she reaches out, takes his hand her last ounce of reserve crumbles
C: TED
D: Oh, God... Oh, my God...
C: JOANNA
D: Only can I still see him?
C: TED
D: No more waiting in Coffee Shops... I promise.
N: Joanna's last ounce of reserve crumbles, she begins to sob. Ted puts his arms around her and holds her. They do not kiss. Then, after a few moments she steps back.
C: JOANNA
D: Okay... I think I'll go talk to my son now. How do I look?
E: chin high wiping her eyes
C: TED
D: Beautiful.
N: They step into the elevator and, as the doors close, blocking them from view, we...
T: DISSOLVE TO:

N: ON TED AND BILLY TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk to the park. They are deep in conversation, although we are too far away to bear what they are saying. HOLD ON THEM and, as they reach the entrance to the park, Billy first, then Ted begin to run, overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive, of being together. As they continue to run, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP AND WE SEE that they are only two among thousands of parents and children in Central Park on a sunny afternoon. THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until they are lost from view and it is...
