T: FADE IN:
N: UNDERWATER - DAY Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface. A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut- off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an expensive camera with a flash attachment. One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it," and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of illumination. SEA BOTTOM - DAY The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these four years. Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly tangled. The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera.
S: ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
N: Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground. SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage. An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.
S: BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)
N: Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait. He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash. Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g. Something's out there, moving towards us. Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel. Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, Death. OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash.
T: MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN
N: Flash! An expensive cabin cruiser, the "Diver Working" flag fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor. Flash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat rocks in the ceaseless swell. On the stern, "Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I." A long way from home...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY
N: A blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity. The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in progress. A banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit." Brody crosses under a High School band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.
C: VAUGHN
D: Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that eloquent solo. Now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call Amity.
N: ANGLE ON THE DAIS Seated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson, and Ellen Brody, very chic. Brody slips into the vacant chair next to her. The following is conducted in urgent whispers, sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on.
C: ELLEN
D: Where the hell were you?
C: BRODY
D: Late.
C: ELLEN
D: I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
C: BRODY
D: Couldn't help it. Hendricks over there... ...still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and I couldn't find the spares.
E: he indicates his deputy
C: ELLEN
D: Terrific. Act as if you've been here all along.
C: BRODY
D: How'm I supposed to do that?
C: ELLEN
D: Look bored.
C: VAUGHN
D: Holiday Inn joins the Amity Shores development condominium complex in a welcome expression renewed interest in Amity Island as the hub of the Northeast Recreational Vacation Wonderland. We're happy once again to be in the center of things, where the action is... We've had our share of hard times and long winters and the past few years have not been easy. But today, the sun is rising on a new Amity, a new island filled with promise. Len Peterson's Amity Shores Development is an exciting addition to our island. The Holiday Inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family. Amity means 'friendship' and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony.
E: droning along applause applause
N: Brody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his idea of civilian finery. Hendricks is fussing with the banner on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit... ANGLE ON VAUGHN
C: VAUGHN
D: ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new hotel...
N: Tina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks' attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon, while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away.
C: VAUGHN
D: Tina was selected from more than 20 of this island's lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition held every spring, and she'll represent Amity Island in the Miss Massachusetts Competition in Worcester next month. When she cuts this ribbon, she will be opening our island to growth, to development, to planned expansion with full employment for our thriving community.
N: ANGLE ON THE BAND Paul Lohman ("Polo" to his friends) is exchanging whispers with Lucy, a flute player nearby.
C: LUCY
D: I don't think she's such hot stuff.
C: POLO
D: When are we going out? You and me?
C: LUCY
D: Not tonight.
C: POLO
D: You going with Patrick?
N: Lucy nods, Polo shrugs, and turns to Jane, a girl nearby.
C: POLO
D: Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as soon as we get out of these monkey suits?
N: She nods happily, they whisper together, while we:
T: CUT TO:
N: ANGLE ON DAIS Martin and Ellen have been joined by their youngest son, Sean.
C: SEAN
D: Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
C: BRODY
D: Shouldn't he be at home?
E: to Ellen
C: ELLEN
D: Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.
C: VAUGHN
D: This money tree, you may have noticed, is made entirely of twenty-dollar bills, donated by Len Peterson, the builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, as a gesture of goodwill towards the community. $500 as a special gift to the Amity township scholarship fund...
N: Applause from the crowd, Len takes a bow.
C: VAUGHN
D: Go ahead, Tina.
E: prompting
N: ANGLE ON TINA as she reaches out with the scissors. Something catches her eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking in the crowd. He winks back, and makes "Cut it" motions with his fingers. ANGLE ON THE CEREMONY Tina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter, balloons drop from the ceiling.
C: VAUGHN
D: Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua- Sports, for contributing the special decorations. And now, the Amity High School band. Refreshments on the patio, everyone...
N: The band swings into "Downtown," and the crowd gets up to dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOLIDOME - LATER
N: Ellen is dragging Brody over to where Len Peterson and Larry Vaughn, the mayor, are in conversation. They pass vignettes: Tina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting Amity townspeople.
C: BRODY
D: Do I have to talk to those two?
E: seeing Peterson and Vaughn
C: ELLEN
D: My boss and your boss. Sure.
C: VAUGHN
D: Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.
C: BRODY
D: Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.
C: VAUGHN
D: Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you?
N: He beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr., a young man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer. They exchange perfunctory greetings.
C: PETERSON
D: The speech was right on the money. Be a love and make sure the bar's open, will you?
E: to Ellen
N: He puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for Brody's liking.
C: PETERSON
D: Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd do without her.
E: to Brody
C: BRODY
D: Me neither.
C: PETERSON
D: Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
E: looking around
C: BRODY
D: All of us thank you, okay?
C: ELLEN
D: Watch Sean for a minute?
N: And she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over- active 10 year old, while she's gone.
C: SEAN
D: Can I go swimming?
C: BRODY
D: No. Find your brother, okay?
N: Sean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY - NEAR THE BAND He is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a pleasant face. Timmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby. A plumpish, curly- haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch.
C: MIKE
D: How old is your cousin?
C: BROOKE
D: Seventeen. She's a senior.
C: MIKE
D: I'm not crazy about blind dates.
C: ANDY
D: They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
C: BROOKE
D: That's awful.
C: ANDY
D: What the hell. Did your mom put all this together?
E: to Mike
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, it's her job.
C: ANDY
D: Is she responsible for the punch?
C: MIKE
D: No.
C: ANDY
D: Good. It's terrible.
C: BROOKE
D: My cousin will be here tomorrow.
C: MIKE
D: Great.
N: Sean finds them, and bursts into their group.
C: SEAN
D: Michael, Michael, Dad said to find you.
C: ANDY
D: Okay, you did that.
C: SEAN
D: Come on, Mikey, come on...
N: He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged off.
C: MIKE
D: Okay, okay. Got to go.
N: Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in.
C: TIM
D: Want to dance? Okay. Later?
E: to Brooke she shakes her head "no"
N: On her shrug, as she turns to Andy:
T: CUT TO:
S: INT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT
N: It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version of "When I Fall in Love." Many teen-agers are dancing out on the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo. Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for a dance and striking out.
C: DOUG
D: Get a dance yet?
C: TIMMY
D: Nope.
C: DOUG
D: Me neither.
C: TIMMY
D: Who'd you ask?
C: DOUG
D: Tina Wilcox.
C: TIMMY
D: You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.
C: DOUG
D: Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
C: TIMMY
D: That's a crock of shit.
C: DOUG
D: I know.
N: Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up by their side.
C: BOB
D: Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?
C: DOUG
D: The mayor?
C: BOB
D: Larry Vaughn Junior? If you see him, tell him I got a six- pack, a blanket, and the Brebner twins.
E: Doug shrugs
N: He exits, on the prowl.
C: TIMMY
D: No class.
C: DOUG
D: None at all. I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
E: pause
N: ANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN
C: BRODY
D: Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
C: ELLEN
D: Why?
C: BRODY
D: Because they're playing our song.
N: And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties slow-dance standard: "I Wish You Love." Peterson approaches.
C: PETERSON
D: May I have this dance?
C: BRODY
D: Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear.
E: taking Ellen
N: They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace. Both of them nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows the chief.
C: BRODY
D: Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
C: ELLEN
D: And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.
C: BRODY
D: I did, I did.
N: The music and the summer moon are working their magic.
C: BRODY
D: Listen -- what are you doing later?
C: ELLEN
D: Fooling around?
C: BRODY
D: Right.
N: He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep on a bench.
C: ELLEN
D: Let's get the kid home.
C: BRODY
D: Home it is.
N: He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt.
C: BRODY
D: You're getting a little big for this.
E: to the kid
N: Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad. Mike, dancing with Marge, waves good-bye. The Brodys start to leave, passing a bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it. They exchange a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking it out of the building while Ellen giggles.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY
N: Brody and Ellen are snuggling under the covers while early morning light streams under the blinds. It's The Morning After, and the clothes from the night before are scattered all over the room. Brody rolls against Ellen, spoon-fashion, morning-horny.
C: BRODY
D: Mmmm.
C: ELLEN
D: MMMmmmorning...
N: They start to move a little, then turn face to face. Outside their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding downstairs.
C: BRODY
D: Sean's awake.
C: ELLEN
D: Door's locked.
C: BRODY
D: Good.
E: kissing
N: Their bodies move under the blankets. There's a crash from the kitchen. They stop for a beat. As they resume, little feet return.
C: SEAN'S VOICE
D: The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.
C: ELLEN
D: Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's sleeping.
E: whispering
C: SEAN'S VOICE
D: Okay.
N: His feet paddle off. Brody and Ellen start to slide together, passion resumes.
C: ELLEN
D: C'mere...
N: Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up. The Brodys kiss, trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk. Then the sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn beep.
C: BRODY
D: Mrs. Silvera?
C: ELLEN
D: Mrs. Silvera.
N: They try to kiss again, there's a door slam downstairs, and talk between the boys and Mrs. Silvera. The Brodys look at each other and break up laughing at the morning, and themselves. ANGLE ON THE BED As Ellen and Brody, with the practice of 18 years of marriage, swing back-to-back, and put their feet on the floor, each on their side of the bed, still chuckling, up for the day.
C: BRODY
D: Need a ride?
C: ELLEN
D: As far as the office.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. AMITY STREET DAY
N: The police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets, Brody behind the wheel, Ellen and Sean passengers. It slows near the foot of the street, dockside, where a real estate office marked "Amity Shores Development, Leonard Peterson, Pres." sits. Peterson's big Cadillac is parked illegally at the curb. It has the Amity Shores logo on its side.
C: BRODY
D: Some people.
C: SEAN
D: What's daddy doing?
C: ELLEN
D: Writing a ticket.
N: Brody is out of the car, his pad in his hand.
C: ELLEN
D: Hey! That's my boss!
C: BRODY
D: Better yet.
N: Peterson, in shirt-sleeves and a tie, hustles out of the office
C: PETERSON
D: Wait a minute...
C: BRODY
D: Too late, it's written.
C: PETERSON
D: Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer. Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
E: to Ellen
C: ELLEN
D: Do I have to?
C: PETERSON
D: Better get a sales kit together for after lunch. I'm taking some prospects out.
E: taking the ticket
N: Ellen kisses Brody, and starts in for her day's work.
C: ELLEN
D: See you later.
C: PETERSON
D: Can't we fix it up to get this made into a green zone or something?
E: to Brody
C: BRODY
D: Len, pay the two dollars.
N: Peterson shrugs and goes inside his office. Brody's attention is drawn by some noise by the dock.
S: EXT. DOCKSIDE, AMITY - DAY
N: Hendricks and an old codger, Red, are working on Amity's newest bit of police equipment; a blue power launch for patrolling local waters. The boat is Hendricks' personal pride and joy.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Tie it off on your left. Your other left!
E: to Red
N: As Red complies, Hendricks spots his boss.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Good morning!
C: BRODY
D: Aren't you off-duty?
E: walking onto the dock, Sean tagging along
C: HENDRICKS
D: Till noon. This is on my own time. Hi, Shorty.
E: to Sean
C: SEAN
D: I'm not short. I'm eleven.
N: There's a hoot from a passing boat horn. Sean waves happily. ANGLE ON THE BOAT It has slowed to a halt in front of the police berth; it's a scruffy working fisherman, back from the banks with a full load. The Skipper hails Brody.
C: SKIPPER
D: Yo! Chief!
C: BRODY
D: What?
C: SKIPPER
D: You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel. Big cruiser.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Whereabouts?
C: SKIPPER
D: Off the Point. No running lights, just a diver's flag.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Want me to run out there?
E: aside to Brody
C: BRODY
D: On your own time?
C: HENDRICKS
D: Happy to do it.
C: BRODY
D: Then check it out. I'll be in the office.
N: Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Cast off your bow line. And your stern line. Spring line...
N: While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the street. Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock. ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina.
C: BRODY
D: Where to?
C: MIKE
D: No place special. Just hanging out.
C: BRODY
D: Sailing?
N: Mike nods.
C: BRODY
D: Watch your kid brother, huh?
N: He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers.
C: BROOKE
D: Bye, Mr. Brody.
N: The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody drives off in his jeep.
S: EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
N: The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother.
C: POLO
D: Anyone want to sail to the lighthouse?
C: PATRICK
D: Machs nix to me.
C: LUCY
D: Anyone got a spare mooring line? Mine's shot.
C: TINA
D: I've got one...
C: SEAN
D: Can I go too?
C: MIKE
D: No.
C: SEAN
D: Please.
C: MIKE
D: I said, 'No.'
N: Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop. Mike is going over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran.
C: BROOKE
D: You're not going out right away, are you?
C: MIKE
D: Waiting for Andy.
C: BROOKE
D: I want you to meet my cousin.
C: MIKE
D: I will, I will.
C: SEAN
D: I want to go out with you. You need a crew, don't you?
N: Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with him, with their gear. They ad-lib "good-byes."
C: MIKE
D: I don't need you. Andy's here.
C: SEAN
D: You always go with Andy.
C: MIKE
D: How was dive class?
E: to Andy
C: ANDY
D: Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
C: BROOKE
D: Shells and lobsters and stuff?
C: ANDY
D: Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson.
C: SEAN
D: Do I have to play with the little kids?
C: MIKE
D: Yeah. Go on, beat it.
N: Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for sea. FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions. He points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves at her cousin, Brooke.
C: JACKIE
D: Brooke! Hey!
N: One of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps on her way down the dock. CLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE
C: ANDY
D: Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love.
C: MIKE
D: I hope that's the cousin.
C: BROOKE
D: Over here. I want you to meet somebody.
C: ANDY
D: Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky.
N: As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the music rocks up and we:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HARBOR - DAY
N: Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and ornately painted hulls tack back and forth. Lots of chatter between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times. It's cruising, on water.
S: EXT. HARBOR, ABOARD MIKE'S BOAT - DAY
N: with Mike, Andy, Jackie and Brooke.
C: JACKIE
D: How fast does this go?
C: ANDY
D: With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
C: JACKIE
D: What?
C: MIKE
D: Real fast.
N: He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze.
C: BROOKE
D: Far out!
N: Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more fun than a roller coaster. ANGLE ON A RED CATAMARAN, "SIZZLER" overtaking Mike's boat. It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr., the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside.
C: LARRY
D: Coming up!
C: BOB
D: Gangway, Turkies!
N: It's immediately a race between the red boat -- "Sizzler," and Mike's "Green Machine." The Kids ad-lib -- "Faster," "Lookout," "Gybe, gybe."
C: ANDY
D: We're carrying weight.
C: LARRY
D: We'll take your supercargo.
C: JACKIE
D: Is that me?
C: BROOKE
D: That's you.
C: JACKIE
D: I've never been supercargo.
N: Donny and Denise's boat cuts in, stealing the Sizzler's air.
C: LARRY
D: Hey, get out of our air!
C: DONNY
D: Want a passenger?
N: ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER AND FELIX Denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as Danny sails tight as a tick to the red cat.
C: BOB
D: Way to go!
T: QUICK CUTS: FUN AT SEA
N: The sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local teen-agers partying with each other: -- Patrick and Lucy's Sol Cat, flying its hull. -- Susie's Laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze. -- Polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "Sea Witch." -- Timmy Weldon and Doug Fetterman playing catch-up in their respective boats, the Doughdish and the Inflatable. -- Marge in her Lightening, sailing close to Ed and Tina in Tina's Joy.
T: CUT TO:
N: UNDERWATER NEAR THE ORCA - DAY Silent, green-blue depths. A diver, Crosby, working the bottom, running a search pattern. Another diver, Tom Andrews, running close. They signal to each other, and make another pass. Follow Tom Andrews as he skims the bottom, near the wreck of the Orca, half-buried in the silt. A diver's line runs up and OUT OF THE FRAME, TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
N: Bobbing on the surface are three boats: the Amity Police launch, the deserted Elizabeth T., from Newport, flying a diver's flag, and the ScubaVue, a local diveboat operated by Tom Andrews and his partner, Crosby; it has "Amity Aqua Sports" lettered on it somewhere. Hendricks and Red are on the deck of the police boat, peering at the cruiser.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
C: RED
D: Figure they split?
C: HENDRICKS
D: Happens every season -- someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
N: A sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera.
C: ANDREWS
D: This is all there is.
N: Crosby pops up next to him, shows empty hands.
C: HENDRICKS
D: If that's it, that's it.
N: The divers head for their boat, Hendricks fires up his engine, and we:
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man.
C: INDIGNANT MAN
D: I can't watch the news, I can't watch a ball game, I can't watch movies -- all I hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio... "Breaker, Breaker..."
C: BRODY
D: I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction...
C: INDIGNANT MAN
D: So call the FBI!
E: leaving in a huff
C: POLLY
D: Black, two sugars.
C: BRODY
D: Thanks. What else is out there?
C: POLLY
D: One petty theft, one domestic disturbance, and an exhibitionist.
C: BRODY
D: I'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others.
C: WOMAN
D: Chief Brody? I want you to do something about my first husband.
N: Brody is caught in the open.
C: WHITE-HAIRED MAN
D: Martin, you have got to demand that Grace Kinney keep her shades down.
C: 2ND MAN
D: What about enforcing the "No Parking" ordinance on Beach Road?
C: BRODY
D: In a minute, in a minute -- talk to Mrs. Prendergast, please...
C: WOMAN
D: Albert keeps coming around when I'm with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars...
E: continuing
C: 2ND MAN
D: Every time there's an out- of-state car in my driveway, I lose another mailbox. Those little iron sailboats cost thirty-two dollars each!
E: eager to be heard
C: BRODY
D: Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney.
E: to White Haired Man
C: WHITE-HAIRED MAN
D: Her bedroom window faces my oldest boy's bedroom, and she's teasing him, dancing around in a towel, or less...
C: BRODY
D: Dancing?
N: Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from the bottom by the divers.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Chief...
C: BRODY
D: Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
N: They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind the door, but it's calm in here.
C: HENDRICKS
D: I never heard of a 908.
C: BRODY
D: I just made it up. It means, "Get me out of there." What the hell's that?
E: notices the camera
C: HENDRICKS
D: Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
C: BRODY
D: Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
C: BRODY
D: If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
C: HENDRICKS
D: If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
N: Hendricks puts the camera in an informal "Lost & Found" box sitting in the office. Brody makes the mistake of opening the door, revealing the White-Haired Man.
C: WHITE-HAIRED MAN
D: Grace Kinney is driving my boy to distraction.
C: BRODY
D: Hendricks, get a description of that dance.
C: LARGE MAN
D: Chief Brody? I want to talk to you about my daughter... she's 15, but mature for her age...
E: to Brody
C: WOMAN
D: Chief, I've been telling Mrs. Prendergast that it's no good just talking about Albert, she's got to do something...
C: 2ND MAN
D: Look -- the township is responsible for protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected...
N: As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we:

N: UNDERWATER Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette against the daylight. There's a commotion, and a water ski drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
N: Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing in the water, the engine idling. Two girls are fooling around; the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is Diane.
C: TERRY
D: Did you ever see a dolphin?
C: DIANE
D: Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.
C: TERRY
D: Great!
N: She fumbles with her skis.
C: TERRY
D: Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis...
C: DIANE
D: Ready?
C: TERRY
D: Hang on, hang on... Okay, go.
N: Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, starting forward. Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright. A wake boils out from under her skis. ANGLE ON THE BEACH Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and sits up, brushing sand out of her hair.
C: TINA
D: Take a break for a minute, okay?
C: ED
D: Huh?
N: Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is towing Terry on the water.
C: TINA
D: Eddie, can we do that? Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie?
E: no reaction
C: ED
D: Next week.
C: TINA
D: With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?
N: Ed grunts non-comittally. Tina takes a beer from the cooler, and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane. She waves to them, and to someone down the beach.
S: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
N: An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves. She acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention back to the skiers. ANGLE ON THE SKIERS having a wonderful time. Terry is good, criss-crossing the wake, showing off. CLOSE ON TERRY rushing through the water, waving, stunting.
C: TERRY
D: Faster! Faster!
N: She waves at Diane, who leans over the controls, to coax more speed out of the old engine. UNDERWATER following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent wake. ON THE SURFACE Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her. She glances at it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.
C: TERRY
D: Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!
N: The fin slides low in the water, heading towards her. She puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free. UNDERWATER Closing in on the wake, crossing it. TERRY - ON THE SURFACE The fin cuts across her path. Too late to maneuver, Terry hits the looming gray back of the Shark. The skis bump, leave the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill. The rope around her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her, preventing her from shouting. She flounders as Diane slows the boat to see what's happened. ANGLE ON THE BOAT turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or hurt herself.
C: DIANE
D: Terry! You okay?
C: TERRY
D: Help! Help!
C: DIANE
D: Okay, okay, coming...
N: She still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation -- she hasn't seen the fin. ANGLE ON TERRY hysterical, pulling herself hand-over-hand up the rope, trying to get to the boat. UNDERWATER Closing in on the thrashing figure. TERRY Screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her. Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water where she went under. IN THE BOAT - DIANE Looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky. She pulls the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with nothing on it -- just a cleanly bitten end.
C: DIANE
D: Terry!
E: screaming
N: Then the Shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and butting the stern, jarring the engine loose. Fuel spills from a ruptured line.
C: DIANE
D: Help! God, help!
N: She throws things at the Shark, which slides back under the water. DISTANT ANGLE ON THE BOAT - FROM THE BEACH Diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams floating across the water; at this range they sound like the normal shrieks of teen-age girls having fun.... ANGLE ON THE BOAT - CLOSE as the Shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws. Diane hurls seat-cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on. She fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare pistol. She cocks it and fires point-blank at the shark. CLOSE ON THE SHARK The flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of the Shark explodes in a sheet of flame. DIANE A last flash before the gasoline explodes.
C: DIANE
D: No-o-o-o-o-o...!
N: A sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the Shark forgotten. She falls into the water as the ruined boat overturns and there's an oily explosion.
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY - ED AND TINA
N: Ed and Tina look up as they hear the distant "crump" of the boat blowing up.
S: EXT. PORCH - DAY
N: Mrs. Witherspoon looks up, startled by the sudden tragedy. She gets up to go to the phone, indoors, and we:

S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - AMITY POLICE BOAT
N: The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore. Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook. Hendricks is on the radio, talking to the shore.
C: HENDRICKS
D: I can't find anyone out here. They must've gone to the bottom, or drifted with the current.
N: BRODY ON SHORE He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his portable walkie-talkie. Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the b.g. Nearby, we can see a sign: "BURIED CABLE: Call New England Light and Power Before Digging." The cable itself surfaces in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole for distribution to the island. Ed and Tina are also there, having given statements.
C: BRODY
D: There should be bodies. Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing.
C: HENDRICKS
D: I told you -- nothing here.
E: O.S. filtered
C: BRODY
D: Try dragging.
C: HENDRICKS
D: For how long? Current's moving everything around, and it's getting dark.
E: O.S.
C: BRODY
D: Stay on it. I don't care how long it takes.
N: HENDRICKS (O.S.) Brody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook.
C: TINA
D: We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' out there, and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke.
C: GRACE
D: That was the explosion. One minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang!
N: BRODY
C: GRACE
D: I don't know what could've done that.
N: Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under that calm surface?
C: TINA
D: Can we go now?
N: Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean.
C: TINA
D: Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?
C: BRODY
D: Oh, yeah. Sure.
N: As he gazes at the ocean, we hear the sound of a distant siren, and

T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ABROAD THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT Hendricks has the winch in operation, the cable in his hand, with big grappling hooks attached. The boat is lit by its powerful worklights. Hendricks heaves them out, watches as the current takes them, then puts the winch in gear, hauling back.
C: RED
D: How much longer?
C: HENDRICKS
D: Until we find something.
C: RED
D: I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry. And cold. And most of all, bored.
N: INSERT - THE WINCH CABLE It goes taut with a sudden strain. ANGLE ON HENDRICKS He sees it, too.
C: HENDRICKS
D: I think we got something.
N: Red moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a near stall with the weight.
C: RED
D: About damn time.
C: HENDRICKS
D: What the hell is it?
N: There's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of the boat down as it struggles with the weight.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Here it comes...
N: ANGLE ON THE WATER lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch. The cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the black depths. What? The coupling appears, then the hook, and an oily cable.
C: RED
D: Oh shit. Drop it.
C: HENDRICKS
D: What is it?
C: RED
D: Power line.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Oh, great.
N: He hits the release on the winch, and the cable whines as it spins out and settles back on the bottom. Red jiggles the line, trying to free it up.
C: RED
D: It comes here from Cable Junction.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
C: RED
D: Now you're talking. Let's get out of here before we do find something.

E: indicates Sean
C: BRODY
D: Every day?
C: MIKE
D: What else is there to do?
C: BRODY
D: You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
C: MIKE
D: Do I have to?
C: BRODY
D: You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
C: ELLEN
D: Where's my day book?
C: BRODY
D: In the den.
N: Ellen passes them on the way to the den to look for it.
C: ELLEN
D: He doesn't have to work all the time, it's his vacation.
N: Mrs. Silvera enters from the service porch.
C: MRS. SILVERA
D: Good morning -- everyone up early today?
C: BRODY
D: There's a lot going on.
N: He follows Ellen into the den.
S: INT. DEN - DAY
N: Ellen is rummaging around the papers on the end table, looking for her book.
C: ELLEN
D: Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
C: BRODY
D: Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat. He's another one.
C: ELLEN
D: One what? Ah-ha!
E: she finds the book
C: BRODY
D: Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
C: ELLEN
D: It's an island. Got to run.
E: she pecks him on the cheek
N: She heads out the door for the office. Mike approaches. ANGLE ON MIKE AND BRODY
C: MIKE
D: I'm going.
C: BRODY
D: What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up old cars? Bartending?
C: MIKE
D: Bartending? I'm 17.
C: BRODY
D: Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
C: MIKE
D: Because.
C: BRODY
D: Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.

S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
N: Sitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike, Andy, Brooke, and Jackie. They are heeled over in a brisk wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are Patrick and Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats.
C: LUCY
D: Where're we going?
E: from her boat
C: ANDY
D: Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.
C: BROOKE
D: The lighthouse?
C: ANDY
D: No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
C: MIKE
D: We got some stuff at the store. Ed and Tina are going to be there.
C: BROOKE
D: Oh, sure, they would be.
C: JACKIE
D: What's the lighthouse?
C: MIKE
D: It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know...
C: JACKIE
D: Great. I got some wine.
N: She opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a jug of Mountain Red. Brooke slides over to her. ANGLE ON BROOKE AND JACKIE
C: BROOKE
D: The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
E: aside
C: JACKIE
D: Now I really want to see it.

D: You going to fool around with Mike? Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
E: Jackie shrugs
N: She indicates Andy, who pretends great indifference.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY
N: spectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse, showing ocean, sandy beach, some of the Kids' catamarans pulled up on the sand, other pleasure boats cruising in the b.g. Ed and Tina are running down the stairs, laughing.
C: ED
D: Come on back up here!
C: TINA
D: Nope.
C: ED
D: Give me back my hat!
C: TINA
D: Double nope!
N: ANGLE ON THE SAND where Andy, Mike, Jackie, and Brooke are camped around a blanket listening to a portable radio. Ed and Tina run by.
C: ANDY
D: Why'd they decide to move?

D: Too hot in the lighthouse?

C: MIKE
D: They're moving pretty fast.
C: JACKIE
D: He's cute...
N: ANGLE ON ED & TINA running towards a dune and over it. ANGLE ON MASSIVE SHAPE in f.g., covered with birds. Ed and Tina appear over the crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of seagulls, suddenly disturbed. The whir and drumbeat of wings, and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock. CLOSEUP - TINA reacting.
C: TINA
D: Yech!
S: HER POINT OF VIEW
N: The huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails. Big festering red holes mark its sides.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: LONG SHOT - SAND AND WHALE From the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants at a picnic. A few more boats are beached and riding at anchor just off the shore, including the Amity police boat. Three Ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them gesturing.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANGLE ON BRODY, HENDRICKS AND A WOMAN She's Lureen Elkins, a marine biologist from the Oceanographic Institute, and she's skeptical. Brody is the ant whose antennae were waving in the long shot.
C: BRODY
D: As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big!
N: His arms indicate big.
C: ELKINS
D: After we've looked, we'll talk.
C: HENDRICKS
D: This is it.
N: He moves forward to clear the crowd. Some kids are poking the massive hulk with sticks. A tourist couple is snapping away with a Polaroid SX-70. The whole mess stinks, too.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Move back, please... back off... open it up a little...
N: The crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins.
C: BRODY
D: See? What'd I tell you?
N: ANGLE ON THE WHALE Brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side.
C: BRODY
D: Look at that!
C: ELKINS
D: First things first.
N: She produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody.
C: ELKINS
D: From the tip of the snout, please.
N: Elkins is measuring the length of the creature. She calls off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all down, repeating numbers as he hears them.
C: ELKINS
D: Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
C: BRODY
D: Come on, let's check the bite radius.
C: ELKINS
D: The what?
E: cold
C: BRODY
D: Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth?
C: ELKINS
D: The whale's mouth?
C: BRODY
D: The Shark's mouth.
C: ELKINS
D: What shark?
N: Brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen.
C: BRODY
D: The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it?
C: ELKINS
D: We don't know that, do we?
C: BRODY
D: But that's what we're here to find out, right?
C: ELKINS
D: You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
C: HENDRICKS
D: I can't hear you if you're going to whisper.
C: MIKE
D: Can we go now?
N: He turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes.
C: BRODY
D: You stay here a minute.
E: to Mike
C: MIKE
D: Oh, c'mon.
C: BRODY
D: You heard me.
C: JACKIE
D: We'll be over by the lighthouse.
C: MIKE
D: I'll be right there. Wait up.
N: They hang around, waiting for him. Elkins has reclaimed Brody's attention.
C: ELKINS
D: Could be a shark. But maybe not.
C: BRODY
D: Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
C: ELKINS
D: Do you?
C: BRODY
D: I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan...
N: He fumbles for the correct Latin.
C: ELKINS
D: Carcharadon Carcharias.
E: helping out
C: BRODY
D: That's it.
C: ELKINS
D: Okay, so that's it.
C: BRODY
D: Is there one in these waters?
C: ELKINS
D: What makes you think there might be?
C: BRODY
D: Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish...
C: ELKINS
D: This is a mammal, not a fish.
C: BRODY
D: Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
C: ELKINS
D: Probably.
C: BRODY
D: That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around...
C: ELKINS
D: And sound.
C: BRODY
D: Sound?
E: this is a new one
C: ELKINS
D: Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency vibration.
C: BRODY
D: So there's one around here.
C: ELKINS
D: Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
C: HENDRICKS
D: We got a helluva tide this month.
E: chiming in
C: BRODY
D: Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
C: MIKE
D: Pop...
E: fidgeting
C: BRODY
D: You stay right here. You're going in with me.
N: ANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to Hendricks.
C: MIKE
D: We came out in my boat.
C: BRODY
D: Andy can sail in it.
C: MIKE
D: I got a date!
C: BRODY
D: She'll understand.
C: MIKE
D: She won't.
C: ELKINS
D: Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue. Additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. Oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks...
N: The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on between father and son.
C: BRODY
D: I don't want to discuss it.
N: Elkins crosses to Brody.
C: ELKINS
D: It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
C: BRODY
D: Can't you tell?
C: ELKINS
D: Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
C: BRODY
D: Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy...
C: ELKINS
D: Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
C: MIKE
D: Dad, please...
N: Brody turns on him. This at least, is something he can do something about.
C: BRODY
D: No more sailing. You come back with me, and that's it.
C: MIKE
D: Why me?
C: BRODY
D: Because I say so.
C: ANDY
D: I'll tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man.

C: BRODY
D: We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
C: VAUGHN
D: We're alone.
C: BRODY
D: Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
N: Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private office -- "Mayor" -- and leads Brody in.
S: INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, etc.
C: VAUGHN
D: Are you serious?
C: BRODY
D: Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator...
C: VAUGHN
D: No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic.
C: BRODY
D: I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
C: VAUGHN
D: Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
C: BRODY
D: We have to do something.
C: VAUGHN
D: We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
C: BRODY
D: I know, I know...
C: VAUGHN
D: And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one.
C: BRODY
D: It's still a good idea.
C: VAUGHN
D: Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke.
C: BRODY
D: Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers...
C: VAUGHN
D: A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
E: interrupting
C: BRODY
D: Two of them are still missing!
C: VAUGHN
D: There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims?
C: BRODY
D: Maybe they are!
N: Brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it.
C: VAUGHN
D: Bullshit.
C: BRODY
D: Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
E: shouting
C: VAUGHN
D: What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
E: shouting back

S: EXT. AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)
N: Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home and family. He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn. The sign reads: "WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN." Plastered across it is an added streamer: "NOW OPEN." Barely visible underneath are older notices: "UNDER CONSTRUCTION," and "OPENING IN JUNE." As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main road and heads down towards the beach.
S: EXT. BEACH - DUSK
N: Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he continues on home. As he drives along, he sees: a clambake; some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few solitary surfcasters and fishermen. The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his jeep have the sand to themselves. It's then that he sees something:
S: BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW
N: A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the surf just off the beach ahead. It's a piece of the waterskiers' boat; Brody heads towards it. ANGLE ON THE SURF As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets out to look at the flotsam. His shoes get wet. He backs up onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this object. It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here" motions. The junk resists.
C: BRODY
D: Come on, give a guy a break.
N: No response. He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up his trouser legs. A silly sight. He wades into the water after it.
C: BRODY
D: Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...
N: It eludes him, and he flounders after it. A big wave breaks across his crotch.
C: BRODY
D: Hoo! Cold!
N: He's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it, he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery...
C: BRODY
D: Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You bastard. A little closer... Here y'go...
E: ad lib
N: Then, he's got it ---
C: BRODY
D: Gotcha!
E: exultant
N: CLOSE ON BRODY IN THE WATER As he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him. Suddenly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something lunges out of the mess and into Brody.
T: SHOCK CUT CLOSEUP - "THE THING"
N: Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water. He screams, and scrabbles in the wet sand, trying to get out of the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged from the water. ANGLE ON BRODY Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on his face, washing his hands frantically, just behind him, The Thing lying on the sand, a gruesome joke played by the sea.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - CYANIDE
N: BOTTLE Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide, from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose. Follow the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the deserted office. He is injecting the deadly chemical into some jacketed .38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle. The radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine reports faintly in the b.g. -- a slow night in pre-season Amity. ANGLE ON BRODY As a sound at the door makes him look up. He hides the odd gear as Hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Chief?
C: BRODY
D: In here.
C: HENDRICKS
D: I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
C: BRODY
D: You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Positive I.D.?
C: BRODY
D: The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Oh.
N: There's an awkward pause. Brody sees the box with the divers' stuff sitting where it was left earlier.
C: BRODY
D: What about that camera?
C: HENDRICKS
D: What camera?
C: BRODY
D: That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it?
N: Hendricks' guilty look confirms he didn't.
C: BRODY
D: Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it...
C: HENDRICKS
D: If there is, develop it!
E: catching on
C: BRODY
D: You got it.
N: The Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail.
C: HENDRICKS
D: I know just where to go.
C: BRODY
D: Not the drugstore!
C: HENDRICKS
D: Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.
C: BRODY
D: The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
C: HENDRICKS
D: Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
C: BRODY
D: Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
N: And he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide bullets safely in his pocket.
C: BRODY
D: Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
E: at the door
C: HENDRICKS
D: Right.
N: Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are safe inside, then exits. As Hendricks watches him go,
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Brody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat. He is slouching towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside. He perks up, and starts to move faster.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Ellen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house. The Kids are on the floor in front of the TV, playing an electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the following.
C: ELLEN
D: Thank you. I'll tell him.
E: into the phone
C: BRODY
D: For me?
C: ELLEN
D: Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
E: hanging up
C: BRODY
D: Damn.
N: He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped package of gun and ammunition.
C: MIKE
D: Is Hooper coming to dinner?
C: BRODY
D: Not till next year.
N: He goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT
N: Brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where he carefully puts the gun in the bed table. Ellen finds him.
C: BRODY
D: Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
C: ELLEN
D: Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
C: BRODY
D: Santos' place.
E: getting up
N: They both know what that means -- the morgue. Brody goes into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively.
S: INT. BRODY HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Ellen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot water.
C: BRODY
D: Oww!
C: ELLEN
D: Careful. What's wrong?
C: BRODY
D: Nothing.
C: ELLEN
D: Nothing, huh?
C: BRODY
D: That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
C: ELLEN
D: Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
C: BRODY
D: Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
C: ELLEN
D: Oh. Want to talk about it?
C: BRODY
D: No.
C: ELLEN
D: Terrific.
N: Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him.
C: BRODY
D: Michael.
C: MIKE
D: Yeah?
C: BRODY
D: You want to come here a minute?
N: Mike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on into his room.
C: SEAN
D: Hi Dad.
C: BRODY
D: Hiya yourself.
C: MIKE
D: What is it?
N: He expects something: this is a formal audience with the Head of The House.
C: BRODY
D: I got something for you to do tomorrow.
C: MIKE
D: I kind of had plans...
C: BRODY
D: Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
E: Mike nods
C: MIKE
D: Hey, come on...
C: BRODY
D: No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts.
C: ELLEN
D: All summer?
C: BRODY
D: He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
N: We see Sean's door opening as he peeps into the hall to see what the fuss is about. ANGLE ON SEAN'S DOOR It opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his brother, decides he wants no part of this, and quietly closes the door.
C: MIKE
D: Dad, please...
E: O.S.
C: BRODY
D: Tomorrow night. Out of the water.
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE ON THE HALLWAY Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming the door as he exits. From inside the room, loud rock music muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age rebellion.
C: ELLEN
D: Not so loud!
N: The music lowers its volume. Brody turns to go into the bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed...
C: BRODY
D: I know what you're going to say.
C: ELLEN
D: Do you?
C: BRODY
D: In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune?
E: on the bed
C: ELLEN
D: It was bad, wasn't it.
C: BRODY
D: The goddamn smell is always the same.
E: he shudders at the recollection
C: ELLEN
D: Are you going to be able to sleep?
C: BRODY
D: Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!
E: he raises his voice
N: Ellen gets up, and quietly closes the door. The upstairs hallway is empty, the doors closed. The Brody household compartmented and closed for the night.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY
N: The familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to the tall steel tower that dominates the beach. A classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking area, followed by Vaughn's Cadillac; the parking attendant waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark: Vaughn, Peterson, Ellen, and some more prospects, including a woman named Bryant and her daughter, Renee.
C: PETERSON
D: This is the town beach; the development naturally has its own private access, but I wanted you to see the concession area. Look at that sand -- like sugar!
N: He scoops up a handful of the fine powder. Ellen directs the attention of the photographers.
C: ELLEN
D: During the summer, the sun sets right there... Over the water. Beautiful.
E: she points
C: VAUGHN
D: I'll say hello for you.
E: to Ellen
N: Ellen nods, preoccupied. Vaughn strolls away, headed in the direction of the cabanas. Mary Nichols, a local Selectwoman, emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions.
C: NICHOLS
D: Hello -- selling some more of the good life?
C: ELLEN
D: A piece here, a piece there, it all adds up.
C: NICHOLS
D: Your husband's been here all morning. What's he doing?
C: ELLEN
D: His job.
E: good-naturedly
N: Michael Brody, dressed in township workman's coveralls, is repainting some flaking woodwork. Sean is happily mixing paint. Vaughn joins them.
C: VAUGHN
D: Your dad got you working?
C: MIKE
D: Yeah.
N: He continues his chore, without enthusiasm.
C: SEAN
D: I'm helping.
C: VAUGHN
D: You know where your dad is?
C: MIKE
D: Up there.
N: He points at the tower.
C: VAUGHN
D: Oh, for Christ's sake.
N: He crosses briskly to where Peterson is finishing.
C: PETERSON
D: And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
C: VAUGHN
D: Len, can I see you a minute?
N: Peterson excuses himself and joins the Mayor.
C: PETERSON
D: I think we got a couple of live ones.
C: VAUGHN
D: Brody's riding his tower.
C: PETERSON
D: Oh, shit.
E: looking up
N: BRODY IN THE TOWER sweeping the water with binoculars, restless eyes trying to scan everything, a grim watchman high over the heads of the unseeing crowd. ON THE WATER Larry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. Bob is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller works. He's on her like glue.
C: JACKIE
D: This is fun! Can we go faster?
C: LARRY
D: Trim.
E: to Bob
N: Bob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts.
C: JACKIE
D: Yay!
N: She snuggles in Larry's arms. He waves to someone.
C: LARRY
D: That's my dad!
N: Jackie waves without seeing. ON THE BEACH Vaughn waves back, preoccupied. Near him, Mike Brody looks up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts. He splashes paint onto the wood with angry abandon.
C: VAUGHN
D: Wave to my son.
E: to Peterson
C: PETERSON
D: How the hell do we get him down from there?
E: waving
C: VAUGHN
D: Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.
N: Mrs. Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter.
C: MRS. BRYANT
D: Renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there?
C: PETERSON
D: He's, ah, watching. A lookout.
C: MRS. BRYANT
D: For what?
C: RENEE
D: It's a shark tower. I saw one in Florida. He's looking for sharks.
E: a precocious little girl
C: VAUGHN
D: It's an observation platform. That's our Chief of Police. He's just checking it.
C: PETERSON
D: Normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching. Nature observation. Weather measurements, that sort of thing. Ellen, we're running late!
E: a little desperate
C: ELLEN
D: Okay. Folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch...
N: At the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin flocking back into the van. Peterson herds them along.
C: PETERSON
D: The country club has an 18-hole course, putting greens, and twelve tennis courts...
T: CUT TO:
N: BRODY IN THE TOWER still scanning. His body suddenly tenses. There's something out there. He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to get a better look.
S: HIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS)
N: Through the binoculars, something big and black, moving under the buoys and into the swimming area. BRODY AGAIN He can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers.
C: BRODY
D: Out of the water! Everyone out of the water!
E: screaming
N: No one can hear him. A few little faces look up, unable to catch what he's saying. He starts climbing down the ladder shouting.
C: BRODY
D: Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water!
N: ANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS reacting.
C: VAUGHN
D: Oh, my God...
E: recalling another panic
C: PETERSON
D: What the hell is he doing?
C: NICHOLS
D: Oh, no!
N: ELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN Looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic. THE WATER The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening on shore. FOLLOW BRODY as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.
C: BRODY
D: Out of the water! Now! Everyone!
N: VAUGHN Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering... ELLEN Moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding the impulsive kid back.
C: ELLEN
D: Martin! No!
E: seeing something
N: ANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN The gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip. People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on the sand, running, some of them going into the water.
C: BRODY
D: No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!
N: He fires. Again. Bullets ricochet off the water, howling towards the horizon. Real panic now. Four more shots. Reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, Brody on his knees, fumbling with bullets. ANGLE ON A LIFEGUARD standing on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of Police fumbling with his gun.
C: LIFEGUARD
D: It's bluefish! It's a school of bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!
N: ANGLE ON THE WATER It is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water in a dark, dense group. The swimmers look around, confused by the shots and excitement.
C: A SWIMMER
D: What's going on?
C: ANOTHER SWIMMER
D: Fish! Anyone got a net?
C: 3RD SWIMMER
D: Someone get me a rod and reel!
N: Laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving the water to join friends and families on the sand. ANGLE ON THE BEACH where Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd collects at a safe distance around him: Ellen emerges from a group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols.
C: BRODY
D: Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm...
N: Curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy. Brody realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the sand at his feet.
C: BRODY
D: Okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. No trouble...
N: Ellen joins him.
C: ELLEN
D: It's okay. It's over...
N: Brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the sand for the empty shells. The crowd is curious and embarrassed. Some turn away, others drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just happened, others stare rudely. Brody is coming apart.
C: BRODY
D: It's all right, everything's all right...
N: Sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious.
C: ELLEN
D: Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant, Len, please...
E: O.S.
N: CLOSE ON BRODY AND SEAN He sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid in a fierce hug.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. TOWN HALL - DAY
N: A hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in session: Vaughn, Peterson, and three others: Kaiser, an old man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and Nichols, the woman on the beach.
C: VAUGHN
D: Brody's a good man.
C: KAISER
D: Nobody says he isn't.
C: PETERSON
D: You should've been out there. You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots fired!
C: VAUGHN
D: He thought he had a good reason.
C: MS. NICHOLS
D: But that's not rational behavior!
C: PETERSON
D: That's what I'm saying!
C: VAUGHN
D: How many people were there?
C: MS. NICHOLS
D: Hundred! Literally hundreds. What are they going to say about us?
C: PETERSON
D: Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
E: to Vaughn
C: VAUGHN
D: So? So?
C: PETERSON
D: So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple.
C: VAUGHN
D: Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences.
C: SANSOM
D: That's what we're here to do.
C: VAUGHN
D: All right. Let's go into my office, where we can have a little privacy.
N: ANGLE FROM INSIDE VAUGHN'S OFFICE as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters. Vaughn deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the room.
C: VAUGHN
D: I believe we have a quorum, and informally, I suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with minutes...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Brody, alone, is sitting at his desk, morosely studying a little gold statuette of a pistol marksman. What's done is done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with it. The phone rings, is answered in the other room. The buzzer sounds. Brody picks up his end.
C: BRODY
D: Polly, no calls, please... Okay, okay. Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What pictures... I'll be right down...
E: she insists he punches a button
N: He slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed with a purpose.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DARKROOM - DAY
N: Amid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the holidome opening, drying on wires. Phil Fogarty, the indignant fat man and town photographer, is locking the door behind an impatient Brody.
C: PHIL
D: I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. Believe me, it's a pleasure...
C: BRODY
D: You said something about a camera.
C: PHIL
D: Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, he works at a hi-fi store, and they sell cameras, so he...
C: BRODY
D: Did you get any pictures?
E: interrupting
C: PHIL
D: Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did...
N: He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him. INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH Brody stares down at it. Sure enough, the ghostly outlines of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a gesture at the camera.
C: BRODY
D: Oh, Jesus. That boat...
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE ON BRODY AND PHIL
C: PHIL
D: Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, though...
C: BRODY
D: What else you got?
C: PHIL
D: Let's see -- you got a minute?
C: BRODY
D: Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
C: PHIL
D: Okay, okay -- stand over there...
N: He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some big enamel pans for washing and developing prints. Phil switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper, putting it under the enlarger.
T: QUICK CUTS:
N: -- Enlarger light going on. -- Timer ticking, the hand turning. -- Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected on the enlarger's flat base. -- Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands. -- Brody staring down. INSERT (PROCESS) Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the grinning jaws of the Great White.
T: SUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK
N: A quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca, trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes through the glass, its head huge as it lunges. INSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS) The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster face-to-face, it's nothing.
C: BRODY
D: That one there. That one...
E: O.S. shaken
N: Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print in the bath. The shark's features are indistinguishable from the surrounding detail.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
N: Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town hall, already lit from within. He's carrying a large envelope.
S: INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT
N: The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and Vaughn are seated informally around the big table.
C: PETERSON
D: Speak of the devil.
E: looking up
N: Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo.
C: BRODY
D: Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof!
C: VAUGHN
D: Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
C: BRODY
D: Perfect. Look at this ---
N: He fumbles with the envelope.
C: VAUGHN
D: Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
C: BRODY
D: What?
E: preoccupied
C: PETERSON
D: Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
C: BRODY
D: Temporarily? Uh... sure... The question's out of left field. Why are they asking?
C: NICHOLS
D: So Jeff could handle things? He knows the routine, he has the authority?
C: BRODY
D: Yeah. Why?
C: PETERSON
D: It came up during the meeting.
C: BRODY
D: Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
N: He throws the picture down in front of them. They bend over to study it, pass it around, look at it.
C: KAISER
D: Seaweed?
C: NICHOLS
D: It's underwater, isn't it? That's why it's so dark.
C: SANSOM
D: I don't know -- what is it?
C: BRODY
D: It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, it's right there!
N: He snatches up the photo. INSERT PHOTO Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not proof of anything without Brody's inner vision.
C: VAUGHN
D: It's nothing I can see.
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE ON BRODY waving the picture.
C: BRODY
D: What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
C: PETERSON
D: Is that what it is?
C: BRODY
D: You're damn right that's what it is.
C: NICHOLS
D: I'm sorry, I just don't see it.
N: Sansom and Kaiser agree, ad lib, "That's nothing..."
C: VAUGHN
D: Martin, it could be anything.
C: BRODY
D: What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch before!
E: exploding
N: The Selectmen look at each other in the face of Brody's agitation. Tempers are running high.
C: PETERSON
D: What have you seen before? This is nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in the lens.
C: BRODY
D: My ass!
C: VAUGHN
D: Be reasonable, please...
C: PETERSON
D: Forget it, he won't listen.
E: to Vaughn
C: BRODY
D: There is nothing to discuss.
C: PETERSON
D: Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him? You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody decides to sue us? That could ruin us.
E: blowing up to Brody
C: BRODY
D: Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary.
C: PETERSON
D: You don't make enough.
C: BRODY
D: Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
C: PETERSON
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: BRODY
D: It means I don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever!
N: There's a long pause.
C: VAUGHN
D: Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
C: BRODY
D: Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
N: The Selectmen file into Vaughn's office, leaving Brody alone in the room. The last one in the door very carefully makes sure it's tightly shut. Brody sits alone at the table.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: They are sitting there, deliberating.
C: PETERSON
D: I won't mention his personal attack on me.
C: NICHOLS
D: I've never seen him like this.
C: PETERSON
D: And Hendricks is qualified, you heard that from his own mouth.
C: KAISER
D: We made a motion and it was already seconded.
C: VAUGHN
D: Very well then. It is moved and seconded that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police, his contract with the township be terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks be appointed Acting Chief in the interim. Those in favor?
E: official
N: All the hands go up.
C: PETERSON
D: Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?
N: Vaughn's hand goes up, the sole dissent. They stare at him.
C: VAUGHN
D: I'm sorry, but I respect his convictions. The motion is carried.
N: He goes to the door, and opens it.
C: VAUGHN
D: Martin? Could you come in please?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's shut down, Brody still sits quietly inside the car. Then his hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer can onto the lawn. Clink. After a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six-pack on the way home. Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the car and starts for the door to his house.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Ellen is working at her desk in the den. She is looking towards the door, expectantly -- it's been an unusually long pause between car arrival and husband arrival. Brody enters.
C: ELLEN
D: Hi. I closed a sale today, without Len. That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
C: BRODY
D: That's great.
C: ELLEN
D: Sean's asleep.
C: BRODY
D: That's great too. Gorgeous.
N: He takes a long look at her.
C: BRODY
D: You look about 22 years old sitting there. Like you were doing homework...
N: He goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly lit room. Ellen has a beer and sandwich half-finished on her desk; Brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer.
C: ELLEN
D: What's wrong?
E: sensitive
C: BRODY
D: Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all.
N: He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk.
C: ELLEN
D: What?
C: BRODY
D: What'd I say?
C: ELLEN
D: That you were fired.
C: BRODY
D: Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that.
C: ELLEN
D: Because of today? The beach?
C: BRODY
D: No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water... Ridiculous.
E: expansively
C: ELLEN
D: Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!
C: BRODY
D: Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture... He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me...
C: ELLEN
D: Honey, this is nothing... I don't know what it is. What did they...
E: studying the photo
C: BRODY
D: ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York... tell him to kiss my ass...
E: going on
C: ELLEN
D: They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them everything. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island...
E: seeing his pain
C: BRODY
D: Fired me! I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw...
E: at Ellen
C: ELLEN
D: I know you did...
C: BRODY
D: I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, I'm tired... I can't keep fighting it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm...
N: Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally overcome him. He slumps in Ellen's arms.
C: ELLEN
D: You're drunk is what you are...
N: She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his inert shape.
C: ELLEN
D: Take it easy... Easy...
N: ANGLE ON THE STAIRWELL Sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas.
C: SEAN
D: Is dad home? I heard something...
N: He comes into the darkened den. ELLEN AND SEAN
C: ELLEN
D: Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's sleeping.
N: Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly.
C: SEAN
D: What's this?
C: ELLEN
D: Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.
N: She takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NEWSSTORE - NIGHT
N: This is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed. A jukebox is blaring some n.d. rock music. Present are Donnie, Doug, Timmy, Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr., Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane, Andy, and Mike. The boys are passing around hot-rod van and custom boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen, Tiger Beat, People, and Time. Andy and Mike are at the counter, splitting a sandwich.
C: DOUG
D: That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
E: holding a book
C: TIMMY
D: Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
C: BOB
D: Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at the town hall.
C: MIKE
D: I know.
C: DOUG
D: Did he really freak out at the beach?
E: innocently
C: MIKE
D: I don't know.
C: ANDY
D: Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want to play pong for money?
N: No one does. There's a bustle at the door, and some couples enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo and Jackie. There are a lot of ad-lib greetings;
C: LARRY
D: How was the show?
C: ED
D: Yech.
C: TINA
D: It was okay.
C: PATRICK
D: I'd rather go the lighthouse.
C: LUCY
D: Who wouldn't.
C: POLO
D: Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
C: BROOKE
D: Now? At night?
C: POLO
D: Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. My folks left two cases of beer in the garage.
C: PATRICK
D: Is it still there?
C: POLO
D: Nope. Got it in my boat.
C: LUCY
D: All-right.
C: JACKIE
D: Let's go for it.
N: There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing picnic.
C: TINA
D: Mike, you going?
C: MIKE
D: Why shouldn't I?
C: LARRY
D: I thought you might still be painting the restrooms at the beach.
N: Laughter from the gang.
C: BROOKE
D: Anyone want a coke or anything?
N: They break up into pairs and trios, some going for the soda fountain, others hanging out by the magazines. ANGLE ON JACKIE AND MIKE
C: JACKIE
D: I'd like to go out to the lighthouse with you.
C: MIKE
D: I'm not sure I can.
C: JACKIE
D: It'll be fun, come on!
C: MIKE
D: Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach...
C: JACKIE
D: No way. Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
C: MIKE
D: That's not it. My dad told me not to go.
C: JACKIE
D: You do everything your parents tell you?
C: MIKE
D: No.
C: JACKIE
D: Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
E: to the gang
N: They ad lib agreement.
C: JACKIE
D: I really want to to be there. Who's bringing the wine? And who's got a quarter for the box?
E: aside to Mike to the crowd
N: Brooke takes Mike aside, as Jackie goes to the jukebox. Larry is right there with a quarter, standing next to her as they select a tune.
C: BROOKE
D: She just likes to tease. I think she really likes you.
C: MIKE
D: Great.
N: Some rock music starts, and we:
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY
N: Ellen is asleep under the covers, Brody, still in his clothes from the night before, is sprawled on top; obviously he's stumbled upstairs sometime during the night. There's a noise down the hall, from Mike's room. Brody stirs, but doesn't wake up.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DAY
N: Mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen -- the noise we just heard. He's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied with his image in the mirror. He takes off his clean shirt, and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt. A brief sniff to make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks.
S: INT. BRODY HALLWAY - DAY
N: Mike is frozen in his part-opened bedroom door. Sean's door opens, and little Sean, also fully dressed, comes sneaking out.
C: SEAN
D: You're going out.
E: whispering
C: MIKE
D: Yeah.
C: SEAN
D: You're going sailing.
C: MIKE
D: Maybe.
C: SEAN
D: Take me.
C: MIKE
D: No.
C: SEAN
D: I want to go with you!
E: louder
C: MIKE
D: Quiet! Shhh!
C: SEAN
D: Michael...
E: even louder
C: MIKE
D: Okay, okay. Close your door.
N: Sean does, and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to Mike; the two of them start downstairs.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BRODY HOUSE
N: Michael and Sean are walking away towards the road into town.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
N: Brody emerges from the bathroom, dressed in sweatshirt, and cutoffs: no uniform today. He starts downstairs, stopping only to look into Mike's room. It's empty.
C: BRODY
D: Good morning, America...
N: A grin crosses his face -- "My son, the Don Juan..." He goes downstairs.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BRODY KITCHEN - DAY
N: Brody enters from upstairs. He heats coffee. Ellen enters dressed for work. He pours two cups.
C: ELLEN
D: What're you going to do today?
C: BRODY
D: Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
C: ELLEN
D: I'll give notice.
C: BRODY
D: Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
N: She pours the coffee, they drink it for a moment.
C: BRODY
D: Mike left early. Couldn't wait to make out. Must be a morning man.
N: Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments. Mrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries.
C: MRS. SILVERA
D: Morning. Anything special today?
C: ELLEN
D: Sean's not up yet. You know what he likes, just some Fruit Loops and milk. No candy.
C: BRODY
D: The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name...
C: MRS. SILVERA
D: Frankie. He's my cousin.
C: BRODY
D: Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an apprentice.
N: Brody and Ellen are at the door.
C: MRS. SILVERA
D: Have a nice day.
N: They leave.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
N: The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of recreational offshore sailing. Mike and Andy are readying his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way. In the b.g., Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police boat.
C: ANDY
D: If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice?
C: MIKE
D: Yeah.
C: ANDY
D: Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
N: Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him.
C: MIKE
D: Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
C: SEAN
D: I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way?
C: ANDY
D: You're always in the way.
N: Marge joins them, scooping Sean up.
C: MARGE
D: This guy giving you any trouble?
C: SEAN
D: Put me down!
C: ANDY
D: Put him down in the water.
C: MARGE
D: You want to go out in my boat?
E: to Sean
C: SEAN
D: Yeah.
C: MIKE
D: Would you take him?
C: MARGE
D: Sure.
C: ANDY
D: You've just made someone very happy.
N: Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening. Brooke and Jackie come down the dock, dressed for sailing.
C: BROOKE
D: Mike! Are you going out?
C: MIKE
D: Maybe.
C: JACKIE
D: I thought you were grounded.
C: MIKE
D: I can go out if I want to.
C: ANDY
D: You can?
C: JACKIE
D: You going to the lighthouse?
C: MIKE
D: Why not?
C: ANDY
D: I could give you a dozen good reasons.
C: MIKE
D: Shut up.
E: to Andy
C: ANDY
D: Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
C: JACKIE
D: Is there room on your boat for all of us?
N: Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself... Timmy moves in, sensing the chance of a lifetime.
C: ANDY
D: Well, we're pretty crowded, and I don't know when we're leaving...
N: Timmy makes his move.
C: TIMMY
D: I've got room.
C: BROOKE
D: Great. That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.
E: to Andy
C: TIMMY
D: You will?
C: BROOKE
D: Sure.
N: And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.
C: TIMMY
D: Fan-tas-tic!
N: He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're together again at last for the first time. Andy is left shuffling with Mike and Jackie.
C: JACKIE
D: I'm ready.
N: And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken. Anywhere.
C: JACKIE
D: Come on, you guys.
C: ANDY
D: Well, I don't know...
N: Jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles. Why break one heart when you can break two? Or more?
C: JACKIE
D: Please come with us?
N: Mike is glaring. The message is clear, if unspoken.
C: JACKIE
D: For me...?
C: ANDY
D: What the hell. For you...
N: Andy joins them. Mike casts off, while Andy helps, and Jackie
T: sits there, looking cute.
N: ANGLE ON LARRY AND BOB watching what's going on.
C: BOB
D: I thought you said she was going with us?
C: LARRY
D: Let's just go sailing, okay?
C: BOB
D: Want to talk about it?
E: casting off
C: LARRY
D: Want to swim home?
N: Bob gets the message and shuts up. The Sizzler fills its sails, and points out of the harbor. WIDE ON THE HARBOR Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational boating mix. The Kids are finding the same general direction, pointing out of the harbor.
T: QUICK CUTS
N: -- Sails being trimmed. -- Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he sets a course straight for the lighthouse. -- Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.
S: EXT. HARBOR MOUTH - DAY
N: The Kids' boats, in a loose bunch, slipping out to sea. REVERSE - LOOKING OUT TO SEA The dive class boat, isolated near the channel, a group of Kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult instructors: Tom Andrews, Crosby, and Sparky.
S: EXT. DIVING BOAT - DAY
N: Andrews and his assistant instructor, Sparky, are addressing the class, when Mike and Andy's "Green Machine" sails by, close.
C: ANDREWS
D: Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be in class!
C: ANDY
D: Today I'm staying topside. You dive for me!
C: ANDREWS
D: I'm going for lobster.
C: JACKIE
D: Great! Find one for me.
C: ANDY
D: With butter, if they got any...
N: Andrews dismisses them with a good-natured wave.
C: ANDREWS
D: So long, turkies.
N: He turns to his class.
C: ANDREWS
D: Sparky will take you down today. If everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop.
N: The class dutifully lines up and starts going in, while in the b.g. the Kids sailboats head out to sea. Andrews' two partners, Crosby and Sparky, get ready to follow the class over.
C: CROSBY
D: Let's get some dinner.
E: to Andrews
N: He goes over, Andrews following. Sparky is with the class, signaling "Down;" they submerge like clumsy seals.
T: CUT TO:
N: UNDERWATER The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering encouragement as they descend. Andrews and Crosby are already disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks. FOLLOWING ANDREWS AND CROSBY as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker, deeper waters. Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks around...
S: HIS POINT OF VIEW
N: far above him, the class, going about their business. Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass. Andrews sees it, too. ANGLE - ON ANDREWS Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the big lunker. Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and meeting, almost face-to-face, horror: BELOW HIM THE SHARK The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring face. Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards, he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away from his lips. Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby. THE DIVERS look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.
T: CUT TO:
N: DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips. One of the class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his convulsions. Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to administer mouth-to-mouth.
C: SPARKY
D: Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us in!
N: In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs. Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually turns towards... the ocean. The Shark is headed for the sea. And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the horizon in their familiar bright colors.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY
N: They are alone. In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids' sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance. The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway.
C: TINA
D: You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
C: ED
D: Just like this.
E: snuggling close
C: TINA
D: What about sailing?
C: ED
D: The tide's running. It'll take us to the light.
C: TINA
D: It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
N: Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the current.
C: ED
D: First things first.
N: He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine.
C: TINA
D: What about the others?
C: ED
D: They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
C: TINA
D: What're we going to do in the mean time?
C: ED
D: I dunno. We'll think of something.
N: He pours the wine into the two paper cups.
C: ED
D: But first, a little juice...
C: TINA
D: And second?
C: ED
D: Mmmmmm.
E: kissing her
C: TINA
D: Wait a minute. Promise me something.
E: resisting
C: ED
D: Anything. Anything.
C: TINA
D: That you'll put down a blanket. I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
C: ED
D: You got it.
N: And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging gear around as he rummages for it. Tina sips wine contentedly, satisfied to wait. UNDERWATER The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of Ed's hasty search. ANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror. Ed is knocked over the side, into the water. ANGLE ON ED as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard. ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood smears his nose and lip. His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip. REVERSE Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands. INSERT Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by the awful force. TINA her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing swell.
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT
N: On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable. CLOSE ON PATRICK AND LUCY
C: LUCY
D: Faster! Faster!
C: PATRICK
D: Coming about...
N: She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy familiarity. They come about and scoot off on a new tack. CLOSE ON POLO Reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone.
C: POLO
D: Great day! I think the wind's going to change...
E: to a near-by boat
N: CLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE He comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady her, she snuggles into his arms. True love, at last... He's thrilled. CLOSE ON DOUG In his inflatable, poking slowly along. Marge passes him, Sean hooting with glee.
C: MARGE
D: Coming up.
C: SEAN
D: Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!
C: DOUG
D: I'm getting new sails, then watch out. Just a question of modifying the rigging!
N: ANGLE ON MIKE'S "GREEN MACHINE" Jackie, Mike and Andy, clipping along, Larry Vaughn and Bob in the Sizzler nearby. Mike lifts the hull, Jackie squeals in delight.
C: JACKIE
D: Wheee! Faster!
C: ANDY
D: How fast is enough?
C: JACKIE
D: I want to go faster!
C: MIKE
D: Hang on...
N: He trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying, Andy and Jackie clinging to the trampoline. ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER Larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, Bob senses what he's doing.
C: BOB
D: You coming up on him?
C: LARRY
D: You bet. Hang on...
N: They gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat.
C: LARRY
D: Coming up! Give way!
C: ANDY
D: Like hell! We're on the starboard tack!
N: THE SIZZLER AND THE "GREEN MACHINE" Running close to each other; very tight two-by-two.
C: JACKIE
D: Don't let him pass. Faster!
N: Mike and Larry silently fight for clean air, racing. Water splashes over them.
C: JACKIE
D: My hair's getting wet!
C: ANDY
D: So's mine.
N: CLOSE ON MIKE'S BOAT He veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing Jackie's hair. Larry and Bob speed by, yelling.
C: JACKIE
D: When do we get to the lighthouse?
C: ANDY
D: Soon, dark eyes, soon.
C: MIKE
D: The tide's turning.
N: Andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character.
C: ANDY
D: We're going to be fighting the current. Wind's backing around a few points, too.
E: he looks up
N: Jackie snuggles against Mike.
C: JACKIE
D: I can't wait to get there.
C: ANDY
D: But of course.
N: He goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds snuggling astern. They pull away from us, and we:

S: EXT. AMITY WATERFRONT STREET - DAY
N: Ellen and Brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work. There's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now familiar blinking red light. Brody, out of force of habit, wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd, which gives way to the official blue-and-white vehicle.
C: ELLEN
D: Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
C: BRODY
D: Just one minute...
N: He gets out, and pushes through the crowd, Ellen following. DOCKSIDE The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance. The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts; some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on the deck. Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to Andrews. ABOARD THE DIVE BOAT Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest. The shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant is wheeling a gurney into position. Crosby and Sparky are stunned.
C: BRODY
D: What the hell happened?
C: SPARKY
D: Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood. Came up too damn fast. Held his goddamn breath!
N: He is near collapse himself.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Easy...
C: CROSBY
D: He panicked! Something scared him!
N: An Ambulance Attendant is putting a blanket around Sparky.
C: ATTENDANT
D: It's okay. We're taking care of him.
N: The other attendant holds something out to Brody. Brody examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless.
C: BRODY
D: How'd this happen?
C: SPARKY
D: Bite reflex, like a spasm.
C: BRODY
D: When?
C: HENDRICKS
D: Right after, the Kids went out?
C: ELLEN
D: What Kids? Who went out?
C: HENDRICKS
D: All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
C: ELLEN
D: Mike? Our Mike?
C: HENDRICKS
D: Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
C: BRODY
D: How long ago?
C: HENDRICKS
D: About an hour, maybe two. Let's see -- I came on about eight...
E: thinking
N: Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd. THE POLICE BOAT Brody is casting off lines. Ellen is on the dock, watching him.
C: ELLEN
D: What're you doing?
C: BRODY
D: Going out.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief any more.
N: Brody keeps working, making ready for sea.
C: HENDRICKS
D: I can't let you take her out.
C: BRODY
D: You can't stop me.
N: Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go. Neither of you can go.
C: ELLEN
D: I'm going.
C: BRODY
D: Mike's out there.
C: HENDRICKS
D: But I signed for the boat. You're not authorized any more.
N: Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into reverse. The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line.
C: BRODY
D: Untie that rope.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Please. It's my job.
C: ELLEN
D: I'll do it.
N: And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Mrs. Brody, please...
N: Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he puts the helm hard over. It bumps the dock, hard.
C: HENDRICKS
D: You're too close. Back off.
C: BRODY
D: Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
N: Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow line. The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody guns it away from the dock.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Let me. Please.
N: He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, pointing the launch out to sea.
C: ELLEN
D: Hurry, please.
C: HENDRICKS
D: What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going?
C: BRODY
D: Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you said something about the lighthouse. Get us there.
N: WIDE ON THE HARBOR The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is headed under full power out to sea. Hendricks is pumping the horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of the road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see the ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through the crowd at dockside.

D: Harbor Patrol. Is that you, Brody?
E: V.O. filtered
C: BRODY
D: Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
C: BRODY
D: Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now.
C: PATROL VOICE
D: What for?
C: BRODY
D: There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.
C: PATROL VOICE
D: That's it?
C: BRODY
D: That's it. Just do it, all right?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: 10-4, soon as I can raise him.
C: BRODY
D: If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port!
C: PATROL VOICE
D: Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port. I heard you. Patrol out.
E: exasperated
N: As Brody's eyes sweep the horizon anxiously, Hendricks pours it on, and the police boat surges forward.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - KIDS SAILING
N: Donnie and Denise and Susie are sailing close to each other.
C: DONNIE
D: Hungry?
C: DENISE
D: Starving. Let's go eat now.
C: DONNIE
D: We're going in to eat!
E: shouting to Susie
N: She nods agreement, their boats veer off from the rest and head towards the lighthouse.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER as it sails close to the Green Machine.
C: LARRY
D: Hey! Brody! Want to race?
C: MIKE
D: Sure.
E: confident
C: LARRY
D: How about a side bet to make it interesting?
C: JACKIE
D: That's fun! Let's race for something!
C: MIKE
D: Name it.
C: LARRY
D: Loser sails home alone.
C: ANDY
D: You're betting what you already got.
E: aside to Mike
C: MIKE
D: I don't care.
C: JACKIE
D: I love it.
C: ANDY
D: Sure you do -- you win either way.
C: JACKIE
D: I'm supposed to.
E: simply
C: LARRY
D: It's a bet. Once around the marker buoy?
C: MIKE
D: That's the pin -- the buoy.
N: Larry is confident -- he's got the air, but Mike suddenly gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack, downwind. Larry and Bob are caught by surprise, and lose precious moments as they fumble with their sails.
C: ANDY
D: Turkeys! Eat wind!
E: pulling away
C: MIKE
D: Yee-hah!
N: He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat moves ahead, a drumming sound. UNDERWATER The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud- thud-thud" sound down to the deep. ANGLE ON DOUG IN HIS INFLATABLE falling behind as the boats change course for the marker buoy, following Larry and Mike's lead.
C: DOUG
D: Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!
N: Brooke and Timmy sail by him, laughing; Polo with them.
C: BROOKE
D: Can't -- we're watching a race!
C: DOUG
D: Since when? Who's racing?
C: TIMMY
D: Larry and Mike!
N: PATRICK AND LUCY Pat and Lucy are trimming sail, moving faster.
C: LUCY
D: Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
C: PATRICK
D: If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
C: LUCY
D: What about me?
C: PATRICK
D: Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in...
C: LUCY
D: Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
E: snapping him with a rope
T: QUICK CUTS - SAILBOAT RACING MONTAGE
N: -- Ropes and sails rattling through blocks. -- Sails snapping taut, filling with wind. -- Catamarans heeled over, racers hanging over the water, dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses. -- Skippers' faces, concentrating on boat handling. AERIAL VIEW - SAILBOATS It's the chopper's point of view, as the Harbor Patrol copter from the Cape flies towards the Kids, following Brody's previous instructions. He sees the sailboats and fly that way.
C: PILOT
D: Air Patrol to Base. I have visual contact on the Kids. Going down to use the loud hailer...
E: filtered, into his mike
N: LOOKING UP AT THE APPROACHING COPTER It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor blades chuffing up a storm. The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is blaring down at them.
C: PILOT
D: This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to port immediately. Return -- to -- port -- immediately.
E: V.O.
N: THE BOATS The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, others luffing, wondering what this is all about.
C: ANDY
D: Your dad must be really pissed.
E: to Mike
C: MIKE
D: We better go back in.
C: ANDY
D: It's not going to be easy.
C: JACKIE
D: What's wrong?
C: MIKE
D: We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
C: ANDY
D: Putz -- that won't be for hours.
C: MIKE
D: I was counting on hours.
C: CHOPPER
D: Return -- to -- port.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: We're trying, we're trying.
N: He waves acknowledgement, and puts about. The others take their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without much success. PATRICK AND LUCY
C: LUCY
D: Heading back?
C: PATRICK
D: Might as well.
N: ANGLE ON THE THREE SLOOPS Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean. They see the faster catamarans come about and try to beat back.
C: POLO
D: They're turning around.
C: LUCY
D: Coming about, then.
C: SEAN
D: Are we going back?
C: MARGE
D: Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody...
N: She puts about, the three of them start back towards the lighthouse, not making much headway. Doug's inflatable is the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at the head of the line beating back towards the island. DOUG'S BOAT The others in the b.g.
C: DOUG
D: Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!
N: INSERT - A WEAK PATCH IN THE RUBBER It whistles and visibly leaks under the strain. DOUG looking down in dismay.
C: DOUG
D: Make that the Titanic.
N: He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying to breath air back into the raft.
S: INT. CHOPPER - LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAILBOATS
C: PILOT
D: Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're turning back.
C: CONTROL
D: All right, Patrol. Go back to work. You've wasted enough time.
N: UNDERWATER Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular pattern of irregular vibrations. LOOKING UP AT THE CHOPPER It wheels around, and heads back towards land.
T: CUT TO:
N: ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY Rushing through the seas under full power. About three hundred yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat; Ed and Tina's Sandpiper. Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport fishing.
C: ELLEN
D: Michael?
C: BRODY
D: It's not his boat.
N: Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump. Ellen watches apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat.
C: ELLEN
D: Be careful...
C: HENDRICKS
D: Anything?
C: BRODY
D: Nope... Hold on...
E: on the Sandpiper he sees something
N: Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a terrorized victim.
C: BRODY
D: Tina!
C: TINA
D: N-o-o-o-o-o-o...
E: a moan
C: BRODY
D: It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --
C: TINA
D: No! It's still there!
C: BRODY
D: What is it? What's there?
C: TINA
D: It's still there!
C: BRODY
D: I need a hand here...
E: to Hendricks and Ellen
N: Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting it over the shivering girl's shoulders. Ellen comforts the girl.
C: ELLEN
D: Tina, baby... what is it?
C: TINA
D: Sh... Sh... Shark...
N: ANGLE ON BRODY - FOLLOWING HIM AS HE REACTS
C: BRODY
D: I knew it. I goddamn well told them.
N: He moves abruptly, stepping up onto the police launch, snapping on the radio, leaving Hendricks, Ellen and Tina on the sailboat moored alongside.
C: BRODY
D: Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.
C: PATROL COMMANDER
D: This is Cape Patrol -- what is it, Brody? I heard you weren't chief anymore.
E: V.O. filter
C: BRODY
D: Skip that. What about those kids out sailing?
C: COMMANDER
D: It's all okay -- Colby got to them. They were turning back when he left 'em.
E: V.O.
C: BRODY
D: He left them?
C: COMMANDER
D: Sure. He's got work to do in Bay Channel.
E: V.O.
C: BRODY
D: Get him the hell back there! We got possible fatalities! Brody out...
N: His eyes wild, Brody looks over at the Sandpiper, then scans the nearby waters with sudden tension.
S: BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW
N: Ellen and Hendricks comforting Tina on the Sandpiper. Nearby, a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by. Brody pulls the police boat's air horn, the cruiser's passengers look over, Hendricks and Ellen jump at the unexpected blast. ANGLE ON BRODY
C: BRODY
D: I'm going out there.
C: HENDRICKS
D: Hey -- you can't do that.
C: ELLEN
D: What is it? What's the matter?
C: BRODY
D: Mike's out there.
N: Brody starts the launch's motor, throwing clear the mooring line that ties the two boats together.
C: BRODY
D: Get her in. Get them both in.
E: to Hendricks
C: ELLEN
D: Martin, please!
C: HENDRICKS
D: Chief, be sensible...
C: BRODY
D: Where are they?
C: HENDRICKS
D: About 10 degrees off your starboard bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast...
C: BRODY
D: Never mind that shit. Just point.
N: Hendricks complies.
C: HENDRICKS
D: See where Cable Junction is? Look to the left. The lighthouse. That's it.
E: pointing
C: BRODY
D: Got it.
N: And he kicks the engine into gear, moving the launch away and out toward the sea.
C: ELLEN
D: Come back! Martin!
N: He guns the engine as soon as he's clear. Hendricks gives his jacket to a suddenly chilled Ellen, and hails the cabin cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding its horn. Ellen stares after the receding boat.
C: ELLEN
D: My purse is on that boat.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE KID'S SAILBOATS
N: They are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse, fighting wind and tide. Only Doug's inflatable, with its clumsy little motor, is making any headway. ANGLE ON DOUG playing at being Charles Laughton.
C: DOUG
D: Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump up this boat! And shave that silly moustache!
N: Pumping, steering, he's floundering along. UNDERWATER - MOVING TOWARDS THE SURFACE The Shark has fixated on something -- one outlying shape, the easily identifiable outline of Doug's inflatable, thumping and putting. It homes in on the sound. ANGLE ON DOUG AND THE KIDS The other kids exchange banter with Doug in his raft, as he clowns for their benefit.
C: DOUG
D: England expects every man to do his duty... You may fire when ready, Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead...
N: Despite his pumping, the bulging patch bursts with a loud bang.
C: DOUG
D: Oh, shit.
C: ANDY
D: Someone pop your balloon?
C: DOUG
D: No problem, no problem.
C: JACKIE
D: Want a lifesaver?
C: MARGE
D: How about a skyhook?
C: DOUG
D: You sail your boat, I'll sail mine.
N: A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, Fetterman -- You got company.
C: DOUG
D: Company? The place is a mess...
N: Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking his raft a terrible blow.
C: DOUG
D: Whoops.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE OTHERS, WATCHING Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the class clown, wondering what he's up to this time. DOUG'S BOAT a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink. The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me up, quick..." MIKE'S BOAT
C: MIKE
D: Doug's down!
N: He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current. The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; the Shark didn't like it.
C: ANDY
D: Doug! This way!
N: Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail closer to get a look.
C: PATRICK
D: What was that about?
C: MARGE
D: You okay?
C: LUCY
D: What was that?
C: LARRY
D: So much for the rubber duck.
N: THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about anything. Until now.
C: DOUG
D: A shark ate my boat.
C: BOB
D: Come on.
C: DOUG
D: I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat!
C: ANDY
D: If he liked your boat, I got some sneakers he'll love.
N: There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents could be made by teeth...
C: KIDS
D: ...Jeez -- what did that?... A porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale... I think he snagged it... I hate to pop his balloon...
E: ad lib Etc.
N: ANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward. Without warning, the Shark hits. Screams, terror, confusion. Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water. CLOSE ON MIKE His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over. ON THE GROUP Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams. CONFUSION As the following events take place: -- Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado. -- Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the drink. -- Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean up with her, just in time. -- Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before the Shark can get to him. -- The Shark dips out of sight. SURFACE, WIDE OVER THE STERN OF POLO'S BOAT showing the results of the turmoil: ANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping together, Andy is the first to gain any composure.
C: ANDY
D: Raft up! Raft 'em up!
N: He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close.
C: LARRY
D: Tie off to your strongest point.
C: PATRICK
D: Anyone need an extra line?
N: Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat. Timmy is looking up from examining Mike's dazed body.
C: TIMMY
D: Mike's bleeding!
C: ANDY
D: Can you sail?
C: POLO
D: Yeah! We'll take him in!
E: testing his rudder
N: He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a severe, but manageable tack. Polo, Timmy, and the injured Mike sail towards safety, leaving the others behind. Tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival. Jackie is strangely quiet; things are out of control...
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON A NAUTICAL CHART - DAY clearly marked: Amity Island, Amity Lighthouse, Cable Junction. Brody's nervous finger traces an approximation of his course. It fumbles, pauses, stops. ABOARD THE POLICE BOAT - DAY Brody, looking up from his chart, scans the ocean. Ahead is the Lighthouse, his immediate destination. Out of sight to the right, Cable Junction, and beyond that, 2500 miles of cold Atlantic. Brody looks up from his chart, and grabs the radio.
C: BRODY
D: Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One. Harbor Air, where are you?
E: on radio
C: CHOPPER PILOT
D: This is Air One. That you, Brody?
E: V.O. filter
C: BRODY
D: It's me. Any fix on those Kids?
C: PILOT
D: Negative. I'm still down.
E: V.O.

C: PILOT
D: Brody, I got to switch frequencies, call my boss. We'll meet you over by Francis Shoal. Harbor Air out...
E: V.O.
C: BRODY
D: Where the hell is Francis Shoal?
N: Static. No answer. Brody realizes something
C: BRODY
D: I'm all alone out here.
C: RUNBY
D: The Amity Police Boat, under full power, surging through the heavy swell, Brody very much alone at the helm.
S: EXT. OCEAN, NEAR THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY
N: We can see Brody's boat approaching. It slows as it nears the island. CLOSE ON BRODY staring, perplexed. Which way?
C: BRODY
D: Shit.
N: He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around. To the left -- the wrong way. ANGLE ON THE BOAT, LIGHTHOUSE IN B.G. It barrels off to the left.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE RAFTED BOATS floating in the current, drifting away from the lighthouse, towards the open sea. Floating on the wreckage and tangled boats are: Doug, Andy, Jackie, Patrick, Lucy, Larry, Bob, Brooke, Marge, and Sean.
C: LARRY
D: Anyone know what time it is?
N: DOUG
C: MARGE
D: Damn!
N: Larry, Bob, Patrick, and Lucy (the practiced sailors) ad lib equal dissatisfaction.
C: JACKIE
D: What's wrong?
C: BROOKE
D: Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
C: DOUG
D: Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
C: ANDY
D: What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables?
C: DOUG
D: I can't help it, it sticks in my mind.
C: BROOKE
D: Anyone want to play charades?
E: making light of it
N: No one does.
C: PATRICK
D: As long as we're drifting, might as well go with the flow.
C: ANDY
D: Not funny.
C: PATRICK
D: Three knot current?
C: LUCY
D: At least. And an offshore wind.
C: SEAN
D: What's after Cable Junction?
C: BOB
D: The Atlantic. Then Ireland.
C: JACKIE
D: Can't we stop?
N: Silence from the group.
C: BROOKE
D: They're probably looking for us.
C: DOUG
D: What about the fish?
C: LARRY
D: Maybe it's gone.
C: DOUG
D: They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
N: They consider this.
C: BROOKE
D: So all we have to do is land at Cable Junction and wait.
C: PATRICK
D: First we got to get there.
C: LARRY
D: How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
C: BOB
D: Anyone got another set of sails?
N: The Kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available.
C: SEAN
D: Is that big thing still out there?
C: MARGE
D: Shhhh.
T: CUT TO:
N: HELICOPTER (AERIAL) FLY-BY A panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft. THE RAFT More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper.
C: LARRY
D: Hey!
C: BOB
D: Over here!
E: waving
N: The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue chopper.
C: ANDY
D: Don't everyone jump around!
N: But they ignore him. The copter is descending.
S: INT. COPTER - DAY
N: A one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered with tools and floats, lashed in place. Below, seen through the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper sets down.
C: PILOT
D: Air One to Base. I have a positive location on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift... ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. I count ten juveniles.
E: he checks chart on his knee board
N: THE RAFT The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant. ANGLE ON THE COPTER As the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn.
C: PILOT
D: Everyone okay? Any injuries?
N: The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative.
C: ANDY
D: Can you put us on Cable Junction?
C: PILOT
D: I got no room for passengers.
C: ANDY
D: How about a tow? Can you rig that?
N: The Pilot nods. Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the undercarriage.
C: LARRY
D: As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the mayor...
C: ANDY
D: There's a shark...
E: interrupting
N: The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts describing what happened, calling for help, etc. It's all a noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job. ANGLE ON THE RAFT The Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming.
C: JACKIE
D: You have to take us off! You have to! Why don't you take us!
C: DOUG
D: It's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room...
E: calming her
N: ANGLE ON THE PILOT He finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the Kids.
C: PILOT
D: Listen. I'm going to give you an assist to get you on Cable Junction. Then I'll call in, and get the Coast Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to something.
N: He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a "thumbs up," and starts the engine.
T: QUICK CUTS - RAFT AND CHOPPER
N: Engine turning over. A line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned hull; it pulls taut out of the water.
S: INT. CHOPPER, THE PILOT INTENT ON HIS JOB.
N: The raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation. The whole operation, getting under way. UNDERWATER looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades. WIDE ON THE RAFT AND CHOPPER In the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene. Follow it. CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER as it starts to lift, inexplicably. The Pilot reacts as; THE SHARK attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats. THE RAFT Kids screaming.
T: QUICK CUTS
N: -- Rotor blade spinning wildly. -- Pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls. -- Med. shot, copter shaking. -- Closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning. -- Med. closeup Pilot in buffeting cockpit. RAFT AND COPTER The Kids watch, horror-stricken, as the giant Shark hangs on the roaring copter; in the b.g., Cable Junction is looming closer. The copter tilts dangerously, the Shark bites deeper, harder. ANGLE ON THE COPTER as it tilts. Then, the unspeakable -- the blades touch the water and explode. Chunks of murderous steel break off the shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles. THE KIDS reacting, ducking in terror. Huge chunks of disintegrating rotors are flying all around. Masts and sails left standing before are chopped into a deadly salad. Screams. LOW IN THE WATER as blades skip and crash, the bubble of the overturned copter, Pilot trapped inside, sinks into the sea. THE COPTER COCKPIT - UNDERWATER Pilot struggling with his safety harness, trying to hit switches, working on instinct. Some air in the bubble, but water too, and sparks as electrical connections short out and burn. Then, the Shark, powering out of the murk. ANGLE ON THE PILOT - UNDERWATER as grim death batters at his fragile bubble. Screaming. The bubble cracks. Water floods, teeth snap at the slippery plastic, the Pilot fumbles for oxygen as the Shark veers off into the murk. ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT The Kids, reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the waves. Calm for a moment, then:
C: LARRY
D: Look out!
C: JACKIE
D: No-o-o-o!
E: screams
N: The Shark reappears, and batters at the raft. SHARK ATTACK The raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding. The Kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage. Marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath.
C: SEAN
D: Help!
N: He and Marge topple into the water.
C: ANDY
D: Don't struggle!
N: Sean is bobbing in his life-vest, Marge strokes to be near him. ANGLE ON MARGE AND SEAN in the water, swimming for the apparent safety of the raft. Then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving up through the waves.
C: MARGE
D: Sean!
N: She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with desperation towards the safety of the floating hull. ANGLE ON SEAN screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he struggles for a grip on the slippery surface. Behind him, Marge helping as much as she can from the water. Then, behind her; THE SHARK rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight. Marge is gone. UNDERWATER Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged hull. Follow Marge as she swims. COPTER WRECKAGE Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking air from his oxygen tank. He sees Marge, and slips out of his bubble, headed for her. MARGE As the Pilot overtakes her -- a moment of horror, as she thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air." She follows him. MARGE AND THE PILOT Scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken chopper, buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube. The chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as currents move it. They struggle silently. ANGLE ON THE CHOPPER as it slips across the bottom, the current pulling it, broken parts breaking off in slow motion, dirty swirls of oil and hydraulic fluid clouding the water.
T: CUT TO:
N: ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT A parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening.
C: PATRICK
D: Sean! Sean!
C: ANDY
D: Don't move!
C: SEAN
D: Andy! Please help! Help!
N: ON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot, and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out. They cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with oxygen-starved eyes. They are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable Junction. Safe, for now...
T: CUT TO:
N: BRODY - ALONE IN THE POLICE BOAT - DAY He throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water. He looks around, sees nothing, in all directions. He hits his radio.
C: BRODY
D: Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come in.
N: Static, no answer. He tries a couple of times, checking the knobs and dials to make sure the unit's working.
C: BRODY
D: Harbor Air, do you read? Over?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: Brody? This is Patrol Base.
N: The familiar voice is tinged with annoyance. He's had a long shift, and nothing's going right.
C: BRODY
D: Where the hell is Air One?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
C: BRODY
D: Did he raise the Kids?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: Last transmission said ten juveniles.
C: BRODY
D: Yeah? Then what?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
C: BRODY
D: Did you say Cable Junction?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: That's what he said.
C: BRODY
D: When?
C: PATROL VOICE
D: 1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out.
N: Brody revs up, and powers out, headed for Cable Junction.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT
N: Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned keel. The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him back. Patrick heaves, and misses.
C: LARRY
D: Sean! Catch the rope!
C: BOB
D: The rope! The rope!
N: The others shoot fearful glances at the waters.
C: PATRICK
D: He's got to help or it won't work.
C: LUCY
D: Sean, baby, please...
N: Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by fear, he shivers alone. Jackie is near catatonia herself, Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her.
C: JACKIE
D: It killed her. It ate her.
C: BROOKE
D: Shh. Shhh...
C: DOUG
D: It's okay, it's okay...
C: ANDY
D: Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.
N: The kid looks up dully.
C: ANDY
D: Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
C: LUCY
D: Listen to Andy, Sean.
C: ANDY
D: We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
N: Sean nods. The other Kids are encouraged. The rope is thrown -- it misses.
C: ANDY
D: Keep an eye out for that fish.
E: to Bob
N: Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching.
C: LARRY
D: Throw it.
C: ANDY
D: Sean! Catch it!
N: Another miss. In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong into the sea. Shrieks of fright from the others.
C: LUCY
D: Larry!
N: He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving. Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull him in. ANGLE - ON SEAN as they pull. The slippery rope is undoing itself. THE RAFT With the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to pull the little one to safety. The ocean swells rise and fall with hidden menace.
T: QUICK CUTS
N: -- Hands gripping rope. -- The knot, pulling apart. -- Anguished faces, concentrating, as Patrick, Lucy, Larry, and Andy struggle to bring him in. ANDY AND SEAN Success. He's pulled to safety. They lash his little hull as tight as they can to the rest of the floating wreckage. Bob sees something.
C: BOB
D: Cable Junction's ahead!
C: LUCY
D: Can we make it?
C: BOB
D: I don't know.
S: BOB'S POINT OF VIEW
N: looking over the wreckage to Cable Junction, now much closer. Beyond it, miles of empty Atlantic. It's off to one side, and unless they can slow down or alter course, they will miss it. THE RAFT
C: LARRY
D: You okay?
E: to Jackie
N: She's not. Shaking, silent, eyes glazed.
C: LUCY
D: Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God, help us, please...
E: alone her lips move inaudibly
C: BROOKE
D: Keep her warm. Jackie? Baby?
E: to Doug to Jackie
C: PATRICK
D: Can someone help me rig a jury rudder? We might steer this...
N: Andy joins him, and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out of whatever wreckage they can use.
C: DOUG
D: By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out. More, with this wind.
C: LARRY
D: Shut up.
C: DOUG
D: I can't stop thinking!
C: LUCY
D: God, please help us, Merciful Father, in Christ's name, we beg you, help us, please, Dear God, save us, help us, please, God, help...
E: praying aloud
T: CUT TO:
N: BRODY'S POLICE BOAT - DAY He is rounding a sand bar off the lighthouse when he looks ahead and sees the bright sails of some of the survivors' boats.
C: BRODY
D: Thank Christ.
N: He puts the helm over and heads for them.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN NEAR LIGHTHOUSE - DAY
N: Polo's sloop is beating back towards the harbor when the police launch bears down, Brody leaning on the air horn. The Kids signal and wave.
C: POLO
D: Over here! Yo!
C: BRODY
D: I'm coming alongside!
N: The launch slows clumsily. Timmy gets a line around a cleat, and pulls them fast.
C: BRODY
D: Mike? Is that you?
C: MIKE
D: Pop. I'm sorry.
C: BRODY
D: It's okay. What happened?
C: POLO
D: A shark hit us out there.
C: TIMMY
D: Mike got knocked over.
N: Brody goes for his radio, to report in, to call for help.
C: MIKE
D: I passed out, but I'm okay.
C: BRODY
D: At least you're safe. What about the others?
N: The three boys look at each other.
C: BRODY
D: Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others?
C: MIKE
D: Sean's still out there.
E: tears in his eyes
C: BRODY
D: What?
N: He stops in his tracks, radio forgotten. heartsick. Mike goes on,
C: MIKE
D: He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't it? It was okay before...
C: POLO
D: The others are ratted together. Drifting.
C: BRODY
D: Which way?
C: TIMMY
D: With the current. Towards Cable Junction.
N: Brody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing it. He starts for his controls, obsessed.
C: MIKE
D: Dad, I'm sorry...
C: BRODY
D: Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
N: He indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine.
C: BRODY
D: Stay at the lighthouse!
N: He roars off, headed towards Cable Junction.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT
N: approaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are drifting towards the Cable Junction. Larry, Patrick and Andy are working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out of wreckage. Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying to slow their drift.
C: ANDY
D: Bring her to port a little. That's it -- steady.
C: DOUG
D: I think we're changing course a little.
C: BROOKE
D: Can we land on it?
C: LUCY
D: If we can get to it.
C: JACKIE
D: We're going to die.
C: BROOKE
D: It's all right, we're okay.
E: comforting her
C: ANDY
D: More to port.
C: BOB
D: It's all the way over.
C: ANDY
D: Shit.
C: SEAN
D: Are we going to go on the island?
C: BROOKE
D: You bet, kiddo.
C: ANDY
D: I don't know.
E: the realist
C: LARRY
D: What the hell, we're steering for it.
C: DOUG
D: The wind drift is lateral.
C: LARRY
D: What's that mean?
C: DOUG
D: Sideways -- For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way...
N: His hands illustrate the predicament.
C: LUCY
D: But we had it! We were headed right for it!
C: ANDY
D: Shit. Shit, shit, shit!
C: JACKIE
D: We're going to miss it!
N: The others are silent. It's true. ANGLE ON THE RAFT Larry, Bob and Brooke try to alter its course by padding.
C: ANDY
D: Don't!
C: DOUG
D: Stop paddling!
C: LUCY
D: But the island!
C: ANDY
D: The Shark.
N: They freeze, as the raft grinds against something. UNDERWATER The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on the rocks on the bottom. ANGLE ON THE RAFT as it slows, then stops, hung up from below.
C: BROOKE
D: What is it?
C: ANDY
D: We're hung up on something.
C: DOUG
D: Maybe the bottom.
C: JACKIE
D: It's that thing. It's going to kill us now... We're going to die!
E: hysteria
C: LARRY
D: Shut up! Just shut Up!
C: BROOKE
D: Leave her alone!
C: BOB
D: Lighten up, man...
C: LARRY
D: It's bad enough without her freaking out.
C: PATRICK
D: She's hysterical, goddamn it!
C: LUCY
D: Don't yell at her!
N: The group dissolves in bitter exchanges. No one is rational. Lucy is the first to notice something...
C: LUCY
D: Wait a minute! Listen! Listen!
N: The group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself. There's a distant sound of a boat's engine. Bob spots it first, and waves. The others follow his pointing finger.
C: BOB
D: Over there! Coming this way!
S: HIS POINT OF VIEW - BRODY'S POLICE BOAT
N: under full power, heading straight for them, THE KIDS go crazy, waving, yelling, screaming, "Over here!" "Help!" "Hey!"
C: SEAN
D: It's Dad!
N: ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE RAFT in the boat, coming up on the Kids fast. He throttles back, his bow wave almost swamping them as he slides past.
C: ANDY
D: Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
C: DOUG
D: Back down!
N: Brody fumbles with the throttle, manages to hold his boat steady between the raft and Cable Junction island.
C: LARRY
D: We're hung up here. Snagged.
C: BOB
D: Can you get us a line?
N: Brody finds a coil of line, makes one end fast, then throws it to the Kids on the raft. They catch it, and tie it off to a cleat.
C: DOUG
D: We got it!
C: PATRICK
D: Go ahead, slow.
C: LUCY
D: Be careful.
N: Brody throttles forward, the police boat shudders under the strain as the line goes taut. ANGLE ON THE RAFT where the rope is tied off to a cleat. The wood groans, screws pop --
C: ANDY
D: Whoa!
N: Too late. The cleat rips out, Brody's boat leaps forward.
C: DOUG
D: Come around again!
N: ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT as he repositions; he's now between the raft and the island, preparing to throw his line. He heaves, the Kids grab, they have it, they tie off again,
C: ANDY
D: Hang on, hang on -- we got it. You're on!
C: SEAN
D: Dad! Help!
N: Brody starts to pull the raft again, when: THE SHARK surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that separates the police boat from the raft. It lunges at Brody as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, snapping it. ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins the wheel and hits the throttle, sending the launch hard to port. Out of control, it runs up on the rocks of Cable Junction. INSIDE THE BOAT as it tips up on the rocks. Brody falls, equipment and loose material breaks loose and falls. INSERT - THE RADIO held by only a few screws, it pulls out of its mount and shatters on the deck. ANGLE ON THE STERN lifting high out of the water, the screw turning in air. THE KIDS ON THE RAFT Their horrified reactions. BRODY IN THE BOAT picks himself up, and staggers to the rail, sees his predicament.
C: BRODY
D: Hang on!
C: SEAN
D: Dad! Dad!
C: BRODY
D: I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay...
N: He climbs over the rail, onto the slippery wet rocks, trying to get to where he can help. The Shark patrols the gap, waiting.
C: BRODY
D: Can you get a line to me?
N: ABOARD THE RAFT the Kids find some line. Andy coils, and throws. CABLE JUNCTION - THE RAFT Brady catches the Kids' line. He heaves on it with all his might. Nothing. Jackie is hysterical, some of the other Kids are screaming. The Shark's fin catches the taut line, it slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled into the water. The raft doesn't budge. UNDERWATER the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck fast. CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral. The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to them. The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone. Larry is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon. ANGLE ON THE WINCH LINE Unattended, it drops into the water. THE KIDS
C: ANDY
D: Get the cable in! Pull!
N: They do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface. It comes taut, but doesn't budge. Brody watches, helpless for the moment.
C: BRODY
D: Son of a bitch is stuck!
N: BRODY climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying to pull the cable free. THE SHARK on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, tearing it off the raft, shaking everything. ON THE RAFT the Kids react to this fresh attack.
C: DOUG
D: It's killing us!
C: JACKIE
D: I don't want to die! Mommy!
N: IN THE BOAT The winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost too much.
C: BRODY
D: Come on, you bastard, come on, pull. Pull!
N: THE RAFT bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler. The Kids, screaming, fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure into pieces. Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the remaining segment. ANGLE ON BRODY watching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in the water.
C: BRODY
D: Sean! Hang on!
N: He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency inflatable in its case. He wrestles it off its brackets, and breaks the seals urgently. He hits the auto-inflate.
S: BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN
N: Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the other Kids flailing in the water. The huge bulk of the Shark, fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion. IN THE WATER While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives. Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last.
C: ANDY
D: Get on the rocks!
C: DOUG
D: Swim for it!
N: Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on the exposed wooden hull.
C: PATRICK
D: Lucy! Look out!
N: ANGLE ON LUCY AND BOB As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is sliding past her, intent on Bob. The rough hide scrapes her, tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her torso.
C: LUCY
D: I'm bleeding!
N: Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks.
C: BOB
D: Help!
N: He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at him. INSERT - WINCH grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from the mainland! BRODY IN THE WATER paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, heedless of the danger around him.
C: BRODY
D: Hang on! Just hang on!
N: He fights to see in the gathering gloom. Suddenly, a strange glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of escalating clicks. CABLE JUNCTION Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by their contract. ANGLE ON BRODY straining to see what's going on. Looking for his son.
C: SEAN
D: Dad! Help! Daddy!
E: O.S.
C: BRODY
D: I'm coming!
N: He looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch.
C: BRODY
D: Andy! Use the lights! The lights!
N: ANGLE ON ANDY soaked, clinging to the rail of the launch, hearing Brody, fumbling in the cabin, turning on worklights, the boat throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many lamps and searchlights. Andy grabs one and sweeps the water with it, trying to help.
C: ANDY
D: Where are you? Chief!
N: His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom. BRODY IN THE WATER He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking, as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks. He is blinded by the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken teen-agers screaming. It's the middle of The Inferno.
S: BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN
N: Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what seems to be certain death.
C: BRODY
D: Sean!
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE ON BRODY as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even, to distract it.
C: BRODY
D: You bastard!
N: He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding a steel boathook. He screams at the unfeeling Shark...
C: BRODY
D: Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!
N: The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new irritation. Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a commotion. THE SHARK SPEEDS TOWARDS HIM THE SHARK lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it passes... ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet cut of the water. He reaches up to it. ANGLE ON BRODY dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable, seeing it, inspired with a lunatic idea...
C: BRODY
D: Over here! You bastard! Over here
N: THE SHARK turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brody. BRODY Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.
C: BRODY
D: Come and get me! Come and get me!
N: THE SHARK Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- then the live copper core is reached. Zap! THE SHARK dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, sputters, and dies. BRODY watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's worklights provide light now.
C: BRODY
D: Sean?
N: No answer. Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing quietly. Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of the raft, expecting the worst... ANGLE ON THE WRECKAGE Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean. There's a scrabbling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under the seat where he'd fallen.
C: SEAN
D: Dad?
N: Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto his raft. They paddle back towards the rocks. THE ISLAND with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. Sean hugs his daddy as they step onto land.
C: SEAN
D: They made me go with them.
C: BRODY
D: Sure they did...
N: He kisses the damp forehead.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. AMITY HARBOR - DAY
N: A crowd of worried parents and adults, Ellen and Hendricks in the forefront, are staring towards the harbor mouth. It's dawn and the sun is rising. They see something, a cheer goes up. ANGLE ON THE WATER A big Coast Guard cutter is steaming into the harbor, a little group of survivors on the foredeck.
T: CLOSE ON THE CUTTER
N: Brody and the surviving Kids wave to their families on land.
T: FADE OUT:
N: ROLL END CREDITS. THE END
