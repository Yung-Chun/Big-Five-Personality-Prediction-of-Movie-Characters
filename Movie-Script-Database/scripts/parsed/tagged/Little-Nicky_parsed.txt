T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT
N: A beautiful late summer night. Crickets chirping, sprinklers sprinkling. We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree, where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb. He has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman. Suddenly the lights turn on.
C: PEEPER
D: Showtime!
E: whispering
N: We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's window. She is wearing business attire.
C: PEEPER
D: Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy? Well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats.
E: CONT'D takes bite of sandwich
N: The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing her feet.
C: PEEPER
D: Oh my G-D, yes! I wish you would let me rub those feet. Of course I wouldn't use my hands. Heh heh heh heh...
E: CONT'D
N: He sips some wine. The mother starts to unbutton her blouse. She takes it off, revealing a nice bra.
C: PEEPER
D: Looks like Victoria just told me her secret.
E: CONT'D
N: The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook. Mouthing the words as he goes.
C: PEEPER
D: Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m., first brassiere sighting... I will pleasure myself to this image for months. MONTHS I TELL YOU!
E: CONT'D stops writing
N: The mother starts to unbutton her pants. Her young son walks in wearing a scouts uniform.
C: PEEPER
D: Young Scottie Dunleavy. What unfortunate timing. You mother was just getting comfy.
E: CONT'D
N: The son talks to his mother excitedly.
C: PEEPER
D: Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great knots today or whatever. Now get out.
E: CONT'D
N: The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.
C: PEEPER
D: Now what. This simply won't do.
E: CONT'D
N: The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials. The son answers.
C: SCOTTIE
D: Hello?
C: PEEPER
D: Hello, Scottie. Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up.
C: SCOTTIE
D: Who is this?
C: PEEPER
D: Just a little birdie. A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh my G-D Scottie. Is there a man up our tree?
N: The peeper gets nervous.
C: PEEPER
D: Tell her no. Tell her it's just a big bird.
N: The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises. We SEE Scottie with his sling shot. The mother nods yes. He shoots it. It hits the peeper square in the head. He falls to the ground with a thud.
C: PEEPER
D: Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me. And wear your bikini.
E: CONT'D
N: The peeper looks up. He sees Scottie pushing a television out the window. It lands on top of the peeper. He's dead.
T: HARD CUT:
S: INT. HOLE - DAY
N: The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on all sides. The peeper is falling down, down, down. The whole way screaming like a five-year old girl. PEEPER'S POV We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire. He SCREAMS.
S: EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL
N: We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES. We hear screaming. Wham! We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in a heap in a shallow pit of coals. Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the fire wall at different levels. (NOTE: All the arrivals clothes are now burned & shredded).
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Welcome!
E: O.S.
N: The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.
C: PEEPER
D: Am I in hell?
C: GATEKEEPER
D: What do you think?
N: A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area. We leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to... MATTE PAINTING HELL MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell. A road leads toward it like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals. We see the black castle in the distance. The camera zooms into the castle, to one particular window.
S: INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY
N: Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser, heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no bed - Devils don't sleep). Nicky is air guitaring to the song. Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled "NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX." The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.
C: NICKY
D: Hey...
E: embarrassed
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
C: NICKY
D: Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
S: INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY
N: ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts. They're aiming for people's faces that are coming through the wall.
C: CASSIUS
D: I knew it. He's finally retiring.
C: ADRIAN
D: I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
N: He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.
C: HUMAN DARTBOARD
D: Aaaah!
C: CASSIUS
D: If the old man picks me to take over Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty four seven. No breaks.
C: ADRIAN
D: Well Dad says it's the breaks that make the torture. You have to let people feel a sense of relief.
N: Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS in the eye.
C: HUMAN DARTBOARD
D: Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
C: ADRIAN
D: Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore.
N: Cassius pulls out the dart. The eye comes with it.
C: CASSIUS
D: I'll take that.
N: Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it. THWACK! It splatters like a grape.
C: HUMAN DARTBOARD
D: Was that really necessary?
N: Nicky enters sheepishly.
C: CASSIUS
D: Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing today?
C: NICKY
D: Good, thanks.
N: Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.
C: CASSIUS
D: Hey. Hey. Hey. Wanna mind wrestle?
N: Cassius' eyes start glowing red.
C: NICKY
D: Actually, I'll take a rain check on0
N: Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible force.
C: CASSIUS
D: Got ya!
C: NICKY
D: Yes, you got me...
E: picking up his head
N: Nicky's head slams back down again.
C: CASSIUS
D: Got ya, again!
C: NICKY
D: Got me for sure, yes...
E: picking head up
N: He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the head.
C: CASSIUS
D: Got ya! Now here's the big finish...
N: Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch.
C: NICKY
D: Oh no. Please Cassius...
N: Nicky's hand is being possessed. It gets closer and closer until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.
C: NICKY
D: Aaaaah.
E: CONT'D
N: Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own hand. Nicky screams even louder. Adrian smiles. They don't notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small devil horns), enters behind them.
C: DAD
D: What are you boys doing?
N: Cassius releases Nicky's hand.
C: NICKY
D: Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
C: DAD
D: Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
C: CASSIUS
D: I forgot.
C: DAD
D: Maybe this will help you remember.
N: Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the floor. Dad gives Nicky a wink. Nicky smiles. Dad has an air of confidence and power.
C: DAD
D: Now everybody sit down.
E: CONT'D
C: NICKY
D: Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
C: DAD
D: Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
N: He leads the boys to the throne area. We see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily. Dad looks, shakes his head. Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him. Dad closes the curtains. Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne. Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons.
C: DAD
D: My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. And after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne...
E: CONT'D
N: Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.
C: DAD
D: ...to step aside. ...and let me become the ruler of hell. This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as Prince of Darkness. So I think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me.
E: CONT'D Nicky lowers his hand
N: Jimmy the Demon walks in.
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Knock, knock.
C: DAD
D: Yes, Jimmy.
N: He whispers in Dad's ear.
C: DAD
D: No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
E: turning to leave
N: Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out. Dad turns his attention back to his sons.
C: DAD
D: This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so...so...
C: NICKY
D: Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
C: DAD
D: Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me.
C: CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
D: What!?
E: dumbfounded
C: NICKY
D: Hallelujah.
N: They all look at Nicky.
C: NICKY
D: I mean...tough break.
E: CONT'D
C: DAD
D: The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
C: CASSIUS
D: Dad! This is Hoyashit.
N: Dad glares. Cassius goes FLYING BACK. One of the Human Dartboards laughs. Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the tongue. Jimmy enters and points at his watch.
C: DAD
D: Right. Right. Send him in. I'm sorry, boys. I've got to get back to work.
E: to the boys
N: Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out. Adrian stops.
C: ADRIAN
D: You sure about this decision, Dad?
C: DAD
D: I'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do.
N: HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by Jimmy. They head towards the closet. Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples. Hitler picks out a relatively small one. Dad shakes his head "no." Dad walks over to the closet. Hitler picks out a really big pineapple. Dad nods "yes." Hitler sadly hands it to Dad. Jimmy bends Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit... CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.
C: HITLER
D: Holy schnit!!
S: EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY
N: Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls. Both are pissed. There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.
C: CASSIUS
D: You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
C: ADRIAN
D: And he's dead serious.
C: CASSIUS
D: It's just such a slap in the face.
N: Adrian turns to the Monster.
C: ADRIAN
D: Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
C: CASSIUS
D: Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
N: Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face. The Monster shrugs and walks off.
C: ADRIAN
D: Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven." Well, I'm getting tired of serving in Hell. We need a place where we can rule.
N: Cassius throws a rock at the Monster. He yelps, then turns around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back. Cassius sees this and gets enraged.
C: CASSIUS
D: Oh you wanna be a big man? Bring it on!! Let's see what you got!
N: The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.
C: CASSIUS
D: That's what I thought!
E: CONT'D
C: ADRIAN
D: Could you concentrate for five seconds?
E: to Cassius
C: CASSIUS
D: I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
C: ADRIAN
D: What do you think about...Earth?
N: Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.
C: ADRIAN
D: We could create our own hell there.
E: CONT'D
C: CASSIUS
D: You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
C: ADRIAN
D: Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
C: CASSIUS
D: ...their damned souls will be ours.
C: ADRIAN
D: It's our time, brother.
N: The two look at each other. They start running toward the fire wall. Knocking souls out of their way.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Hey, what are you doing?!?
N: They get closer to the fire.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: You can't go through there. The fire flows in, not out.
E: CONT'D
N: They dive through the fire wall. It FREEZES.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: You know something? You guys suck! You really suck!
E: CONT'D
N: Sirens go off. Dogs start barking. Lights flash. And we hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the firewall hard.
S: INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER
N: Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix tapes. We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb." Pause. Dad exhales.
C: DAD
D: Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
C: NICKY
D: Definitely.
C: DAD
D: I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
C: NICKY
D: Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
N: Hits the tape player. "Enter Sandman" blasts.
C: DAD
D: Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
C: NICKY
D: Metallica, Dad. Come on.
C: DAD
D: I was just playing with you.
N: Dad and Nicky dance to the song.
S: INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER
N: CLOSE ON DAD.
C: DAD
D: I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
N: ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.
C: DAN
D: C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
C: DAD
D: In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
C: DAN
D: You did it for Namath.
C: DAD
D: Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
C: DAN
D: This is bullshit, man. I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
E: gets up to leave
C: DAD
D: Now you're talking.
N: Dan exits.
C: NICKY
D: You're a good devil, Dad.
C: DAD
D: And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
N: Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens. The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his knees.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell. They went through the fire, and they broke it. I think they took the New York tunnel. I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir.
C: DAD
D: Oh, boy. Oh boy. Calm down. Get off your knees.
N: The Gatekeeper stands up.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Thanks for being so understanding, your worship. You're the man. You've always been the man.
N: Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up. Two huge boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head. We only see them from the front for a second. From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to Nicky.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
E: CONT'D to Nicky
C: NICKY
D: Coulda been much worse.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: That's what I'm thinkin'...
N: Dad is staring off. He looks shaken.
C: DAD
D: This is bad, Nicky.
C: NICKY
D: How bad?
C: DAD
D: I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
N: GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.
C: LUCIFER
D: What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
C: DAD
D: Everything's fine, pop.
C: LUCIFER
D: Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
C: DAD
D: Please, pop, just go back to your room.
C: LUCIFER
D: Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
E: regarding gateskeeper
C: DAD
D: Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
N: The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it.
S: EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER
N: We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED SOULS in hell are sneaking off. The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do. Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.
C: DAMNED SOULS
D: What's going on? Where are we?
E: O.S.
N: We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud thuds.
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
C: NICKY
D: We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
C: DAD
D: To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
C: NICKY
D: So go get 'em, Dad!
C: DAD
D: I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
N: Dad holds up his hand. His pink is hanging by a thread. We see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.
C: NICKY
D: So go get 'em, Jimmy!
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
C: NICKY
D: You're not saying it's up to me?
N: The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as if to say, "oh no."
C: NICKY
D: I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
C: DAD
D: Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
C: NICKY
D: Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Not go. They left together at the exact same time. They gotta come back together at the exact same time.
N: Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.
C: DAD
D: Here. Get them drunk from this. One sip and they'll be trapped inside. Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate.
N: Dad's pinky is hanging. Jimmy pulls it off and examines it. The Monster gags.
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Your ol' man's got less than a week.
N: Nicky looks petrified.
C: NICKY
D: No. This can't be happening.
C: DAD
D: Son, just do your best.
N: Nicky looks teary eyed. The moment is broken by the Monster, who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire. Nicky goes through the solid fire wall. PAUSE. The Monster taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get a move on."
S: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY
N: A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between two tracks, to a putrid puddle. Nicky breaks through the surface, sputtering. We hear a rumbling in the near distance.
C: NICKY
D: Okay. Earth. The Blue Marble. This doesn't look too bad.
N: Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and WHAMMM!
S: EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in the coal pit. His Dad limps back to him.
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
C: NICKY
D: I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
C: DAD
D: That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
C: NICKY
D: Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
C: DAD
D: Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry.
E: his ear falls off
N: Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.
S: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY
N: Nicky makes it back through the hole. Looks both ways and hops out of the hole. He carefully crosses the tracks and is stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side. In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport. On the sign is scrawled "NICKY." Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.
C: NICKY
D: I'm Nicky.
N: Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.
C: BEEFY
D: Hey, terrific!! Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains.
E: voice of Sandy Wernick
S: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY
N: The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking around suspiciously, talking to the dog.
C: BEEFY
D: My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
C: NICKY
D: I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
C: BEEFY
D: It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
N: Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.
C: NICKY
D: Okay, "bro," this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
E: pulling out the flask
C: BEEFY
D: It's not me, moron.
C: NICKY
D: Oh. Sorry.
S: EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
N: A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance. People put money in his pot.
C: PREACHER
D: Oh how the Lord loves you. All his children. He thanks you for your kindness. God bless, Ma'am. The Lord loves you... The Lord loves you...
E: passerby puts in money another woman puts in money
N: We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind. The PREACHER sniffs.
C: PREACHER
D: The Lord does not love you. I sense...pure evil. You make the Lord very nervous. I'm burning...ahhh. The Devil walks among us!
E: CONT'D thrusts his cross in Nicky's face feeling hot running away
N: He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.
C: PREACHER
D: Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!
E: CONT'D
N: He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance. He disappears. Beefy turns to Nicky.
C: BEEFY
D: Makin' friends already.
C: NICKY
D: It's freezing up here, Beefy.
E: shivering a little
C: BEEFY
D: You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
C: NICKY
D: I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
C: BEEFY
D: That pain is hunger.
S: EXT. BENCH - DAY
N: K-mart bag is next to a bench. PAN UP to see Nicky wearing an extra warm SKI OUTFIT. Sitting next to him on the bench is Beefy. Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN. Nicky takes out a drumstick.
C: NICKY
D: So far, so good. Now what?
C: BEEFY
D: Put it in your mouth.
N: Nicky puts it in his mouth. Holds it there.
C: BEEFY
D: Move your teeth up and down.
E: CONT'D
N: Nicky does. He chews for a long time.
C: BEEFY
D: Now you gotta swallow it. Tilt your head back and let the meat slide down your throat-hole.
E: CONT'D
N: Nicky does. He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.
C: NICKY
D: Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
C: BEEFY
D: It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
C: NICKY
D: I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
N: NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right into the path of a moving bus.
S: INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs. The gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra. He seems to be enjoying it. We hear a THUD. They look down to see Nicky on the ground. (We didn't see him flying through this time.) The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop. Kind of embarrassed.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Hey.
C: NICKY
D: That's a pretty brassiere.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Thanks.
C: NICKY
D: Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
C: GATEKEEPER
D: You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
C: NICKY
D: You got it.
N: Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall. As soon as his back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I love your boobs." The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh (we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).
S: EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY
N: Beefy is walking with him down the street. Nicky is crazy cautious.
C: NICKY
D: From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
C: BEEFY
D: Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
T: FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
N: Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club. Champagne is on the table. Bills in his mouth. We see THREE DANCERS dancing for him.
T: FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. VILLAGE STREET
N: Nicky and Beefy.
C: BEEFY
D: So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate.
S: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.
C: TODD
D: I know exactly how you feel... The night Reagan was elected, I said to my mother, "Is this man going to blow up the world, Mommy?" Then we both cried for like an hour. Somebody's here. Call you later.
E: on phone knock at the door
N: Todd gets up and opens the door. It's Nicky, with Beefy by his side. Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.
C: NICKY
D: Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
C: TODD
D: Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
N: Nicky looks down at Beefy. Beefy looks up at Nicky. Both nod imperceptibly.
C: NICKY
D: Yes. What is rent?
C: TODD
D: Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
C: NICKY
D: Off limits.
C: TODD
D: Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
E: looks at Nicky
C: NICKY
D: No.
C: TODD
D: It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
C: NICKY
D: Yeah. The deep South.
N: Nicky laughs a little too hard.
C: TODD
D: Why is that funny?
C: NICKY
D: I don't know.
C: TODD
D: And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
N: Todd turns and goes into the apartment.
C: BEEFY
D: You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
C: NICKY
D: Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
E: to Todd
C: TODD
D: Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.
N: The door closes. Beefy looks down at the welcome mat. It reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING. Beefy raises his leg over it.
S: INT. NICKY'S ROOM
N: Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully clothed. When he inhales through his nose, we hear that familiar snoring/snorting sound. But when he exhales, we hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices. SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands, looking concerned.
S: EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING
N: We HEAR the bells toll. We see the beautiful exterior of a large church.
S: INT. CATHEDRAL
N: CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL. He ascends the steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation. We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service. He gins his homily.
C: CARDINAL
D: In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that. Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible. Moses this. Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.
N: The crowd stares dumbfounded. We see that the Cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open.
C: CARDINAL
D: Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity. But has he ever really done anything for us? Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway? Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes? No. He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us.
E: CONT'D
N: A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.
C: MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
D: The Lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs.
C: CARDINAL
D: Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs. He's a bore. At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.
N: A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby.
C: CARDINAL
D: No, your best friend Fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby. He helped her conceive it all night long.
N: Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts to "raise the roof." Then thinks better of it. The Cardinal points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.
C: CARDINAL
D: How about you, Mr. Mayor? The Lord ever do anything for you?
E: CONT'D
N: The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.
C: MAYOR
D: Well, I wish I could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can't. Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord. If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called "sins." Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want.
E: standing
N: A hubbub is raised by the crowd. Fitzie raises the roof again, this time energetically.
C: CARDINAL
D: Amen to that. Let the sin begin!
N: The hubbub grows to a roar. Several PEOPLE start fighting over the money in the collection plate. The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor. We hear the Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.
C: ADRIAN
D: Oh, this is delicious.
E: O.S.
N: ON MAYOR He's smirking. WE HEAR his telepathic response.
C: CASSIUS
D: "Let the sin begins" - that was a good one.
E: O.S. laughing
C: ADRIAN
D: Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
E: O.S.
C: CASSIUS
D: I lowered the drinking age to ten.
E: O.S.
C: ADRIAN
D: Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
E: O.S.
C: CASSIUS
D: Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
E: O.S.
N: The Mayor/Cassius laughs. As he does, his eyes slowly cross.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk. PAN OVER TO: Nicky, his pants around his ankles. He's trying to do the same.
C: NICKY
D: This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
C: BEEFY
D: Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
C: NICKY
D: Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
E: pulling up pants
C: BEEFY
D: Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
C: NICKY
D: Well, let's rock and roll.
N: Nicky looks at the next person walking by. It's a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle. Nicky clotheslines him, taking him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.
C: NICKY
D: Get in the bottle. Dad's falling apart. You froze the gate and you're killing him. Drink!
E: CONT'D
N: Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.
C: CHINESE DELIVERY GUY
D: I'm not thirsty! I'm not thirsty!
C: NICKY
D: just get in the flask!
N: The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick to the head and runs away. Nicky gets up.
C: NICKY
D: Adrian and Cassius! You think a kick to the head is gonna make me throw in the towel? Well, in the immortal words of Judas Priest, "You got another thing comin'."
E: CONT'D
N: Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Nicky approaches various people as they pass. (To be shot long lense, real people, real reactions.)
S: INT. POPEYE'S - DAY
N: Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the Cashier to drink. The Cashier yanks his head away and gives Nicky a dirty look. Nicky shrugs and points to the menu, ordering some chicken.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: nicky walks up to a homeless man. He thrusts the bottle in his face. To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes it and drinks. Nothing happens. Nicky is baffled. He tries to take the flask back, but the man won't let go. Finally he grabs it away from him. The man starts throwing garbage at Nicky as he walks away.
S: INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY
N: Beefy is looking around for Nicky. He spots him - inside the polar bear cage. Nicky approaches the bear holding the flask.
S: INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again. The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Bus?
C: NICKY
D: Beast.
N: The Monster laughs.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: You like that? You think that's funny?
E: to Monster
N: The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: How about that? You like that?
E: CONT'D
N: The Monster howls with delight.
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
N: Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a Popeye's drumstick.
C: NICKY
D: All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
C: BEEFY
D: I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
N: Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores. He's asleep. Beefy sighs.
C: BEEFY
D: Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just begging to come out...
E: CONT'D
N: Beefy walks away.
S: EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY
N: Nicky snores. Masses of birds fly out of the trees. Nicky snores. Squirrels run out of trees. Nicky snores. ON WORRIED PEOPLE Staring at Nicky who continues to snore. Two HEAVY-METAL GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a goofy dance. They hear something and turn the music down: it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.
C: PETER
D: Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
C: JOHN
D: 'Bout time...
N: Nicky snores. It sounds like "I will eat your hearts." The worried people run away. Nicky snores. Children on the Carousel, going real fast, upset. Nicky snores. Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.
C: JOHN
D: There's our man.
E: CONT'D
C: PETER
D: Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
N: A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky. He eyes the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.
C: JOHN
D: What's with that guy?
C: PETER
D: Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
N: Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten drumstick) and runs off.
C: JOHN
D: Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
C: PETER
D: Should we wake him up?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah. You do it.
N: Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud SNORT.
C: PETER
D: Rise and shine, devil guy. Some dude just stole your shit.
N: Nicky feels for the flask. It's gone.
C: NICKY
D: Oh nooooo....
N: Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.
C: NICKY
D: Which way did he go?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: That way.
N: Nicky is about to run off. Looks at John's shirt.
C: NICKY
D: Iron Maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal.
N: He runs off.
C: PETER
D: Did you check out the dragon mouth?
C: JOHN
D: The Dark Prince is here.
S: EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
N: Nicky is searching the street for his flask. He walks past several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the sidewalk. PAUSE. Nicky comes walking back into frame as he sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the blanket of the VENDOR.
C: NICKY
D: Hey...
C: STREET VENDOR
D: See something you like, my man?
C: NICKY
D: Yes. I would like my flask back.
N: The street vendor stands, very angry.
C: STREET VENDOR
D: You callin' me a thief, my man?
C: NICKY
D: No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
C: STREET VENDOR
D: And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
C: NICKY
D: I don't know?
E: not sure what the answer is
N: A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.
C: MAN
D: Yeah, how much for the silver flask there?
C: STREET VENDOR
D: Well, that's a very special item. The cap itself is one hundred percent plappium. It's a value is over three thousand dollars.
C: MAN
D: Really. Where's it from?
C: NICKY
D: It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once again.
C: MAN
D: Really. I think we'll let you keep it then.
N: He walks away.
C: STREET VENDOR
D: Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
C: NICKY
D: Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
N: We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.
C: STREET VENDOR
D: Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me? I'll show you some crazy eyes. Let's get busy.
N: The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts swinging his fists around. Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is selling clothes off a spread out blanket. She notices what's going on. Nicky's eyes widen in panic. Just then, Valerie steps in.
C: VALERIE
D: Excuse me, does that flask belong to this man?
C: STREET VENDOR
D: Now you callin' me a thief? Damn.
E: frustrated
C: VALERIE
D: Look, I know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time. But today, the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you. So why don't you admit today's not your day and give him his flask back?
C: STREET VENDOR
D: Or what're you gonna do about it? Ugly me to death?
C: VALERIE
D: No, but maybe that cop over there might have something to say.
N: Valerie points to a cop across the street. The Street Vendor ponders this for a second, then...
C: STREET VENDOR
D: Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy. And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner. Before I show you what real crazy is.
E: looking at Valerie
N: The vendor does crazy eyes again.
C: VALERIE
D: Fine. I will.
N: Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.
C: NICKY
D: Hey, mister. I'll be seeing you in a few years.
N: Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky follows her.
C: NICKY
D: That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
E: CONT'D
C: VALERIE
D: That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
C: NICKY
D: You think I'm a tourist?
C: VALERIE
D: I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
C: NICKY
D: The South.
C: VALERIE
D: Really?
C: NICKY
D: Yeah. Deep south.
E: laughs hard
N: She laughs along with him, not sure why.
C: VALERIE
D: Why are you laughing?
C: NICKY
D: I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
C: VALERIE
D: My dad's an optometrist.
C: NICKY
D: My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
C: VALERIE
D: I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
C: NICKY
D: If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
C: VALERIE
D: Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
N: Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her. He hands her the half-eaten drumstick.
C: NICKY
D: Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
C: VALERIE
D: That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
C: NICKY
D: Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
C: VALERIE
D: If you want to.
C: NICKY
D: Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
C: VALERIE
D: "Octopus people?"
C: NICKY
D: Uh, it's a deep south expression.
N: Nicky laughs.
S: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
N: They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.
C: NICKY
D: It's freezing my hands.
C: VALERIE
D: It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
N: Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky. Just then the PREACHER walks by. He quickly turns his head, sensing Nicky.
C: PREACHER
D: Why do you taunt me with your darkness?! Your evil is stinking up our streets! We're all gonna die!
N: He takes off running right into a lamp post.
C: VALERIE
D: This town is really going to hell lately. So what part of the city do you live in?
E: Nicky nods
C: NICKY
D: I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
C: VALERIE
D: You have a dog? What kind?
E: laughs
C: NICKY
D: I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
N: Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.
C: BEEFY
D: Remember, it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean.
C: GIRL DOG
D: Just finish.
S: EXT. STREET - VALERIE & NICKY CONTINUOUS - DAY
C: VALERIE
D: I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
C: NICKY
D: School?
C: VALERIE
D: Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
C: NICKY
D: What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
C: VALERIE
D: My perfume?
N: He takes her wrist to his nose. He stares at it, licks it.
C: VALERIE
D: It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Which I think is the French word for coconuts.
E: CONT'D laughs
N: Nicky stops and looks at her.
C: NICKY
D: Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
C: VALERIE
D: Sometimes, sure.
C: NICKY
D: Good. I was concerned.
S: EXT. GATES OF HELL - DAY
N: The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall. We hear loud wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Doesn't sound very good behind there. I hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.
N: The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather biker's hat. He nods along in agreement. PAN TO LUCIFER Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of fire/pond.
C: LUCIFER
D: You know, I was the one who created Hell.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: I know, your wickedness.
C: LUCIFER
D: I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
N: The Monster laughs really hard.
C: LUCIFER
D: Take it easy there, Chewbacca. In fact, you look like her mother, except she had more hair.
E: CONT'D
N: The Monster laughs even harder.
C: LUCIFER
D: You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
E: CONT'D
C: GATEKEEPER
D: It's Stanley, sir.
C: LUCIFER
D: Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: What was it called, sir.
C: LUCIFER
D: Boogerland!
C: GATEKEEPER
D: That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
C: LUCIFER
D: I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
N: We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's fishing line to:
S: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
N: We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook. A giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body. Only his head is sticking out.
C: PEEPER
D: I deserve this!
S: EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY
N: Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.
C: KID
D: I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar.
N: KID #2 How many beers did you have? KID # 3 Eight sips.
C: KID
D: I had five! I'm so wasted.
N: They both high five, throw up and fall. PAN over to ADRIAN sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.
C: ADRIAN
D: When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific. But when a child goes... that's why I'm in this business.
N: Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with Valerie. He's shocked. Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her collection.
C: NICKY
D: So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
C: VALERIE
D: Basically, yeah.
C: NICKY
D: Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
N: Valerie laughs.
C: VALERIE
D: You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
C: NICKY
D: Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
C: VALERIE
D: What?
N: Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden. NICKY looks like he's been stunned by something.
C: NICKY
D: Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
C: VALERIE
D: What was that?
C: NICKY
D: I...I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
E: shocked and confused
T: QUICK CUT TO:
N: Adrian's eyes flashing.
C: NICKY
D: ...I've always wanted to have sex with a gross pig. What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and see what happens?
E: CONT'D
N: Valerie's very hurt.
C: VALERIE
D: You're a jerk.
N: She turns and walks away. Nicky looks over and sees Adrian. His inner voice speaks to him.
C: NICKY
D: ADRIAN!
E: O.S.
C: ADRIAN
D: You shouldn't have come here.
E: O.S.
C: NICKY
D: Please, get out of my mind!
E: O.S.
N: Adrian's eyes flash.
C: NICKY
D: Hey, Valerie!
E: CONT'D
N: She stops and turns. Nicky RAISES his fist to resist Adrian's force. It's too much. His middle finger comes up, giving her the "finger."
C: VALERIE
D: What the hell's your problem?
N: She runs away crying. Nicky turns to Adrian who's still across the street.
C: NICKY
D: Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
E: O.S.
C: ADRIAN
D: He's sick?
E: O.S.
C: NICKY
D: Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
E: O.S.
N: Adrian processes this.
C: ADRIAN
D: He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
E: O.S.
C: NICKY
D: Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
E: O.S.
C: ADRIAN
D: How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
E: O.S.
N: Nicky's body jerks around.
C: NICKY
D: Adrian, please...
E: O.S.
N: Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large truck bearing down on him. JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them. Peter looks down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.
C: PETER
D: Check this out. The number of the beast.
N: They laugh and hi-five. ON THE TV - DAY

C: DAN RATHER
D: Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly's shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city. Today, some disgruntled cast members of the play CATS broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner.
N: VIDEO FOOTAGE A few CATS are down in the aisle physically pushing around shocked audience members. BACK ON DAN RATHER
C: DAN RATHER

D: I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
C: KATHY LEE
D: You keep a bat under your seat?
C: REGIS
D: Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
C: KATHY LEE
D: Yes, great movie...
C: REGIS
D: I was DeNiro!
N: The blue haired lady AUDIENCE is crying. The TV turns off. We PULL BACK to see that we are in.
S: INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Beefy turns to Nicky.
C: BEEFY
D: Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
C: NICKY
D: What can I do about it?
C: BEEFY
D: You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
C: NICKY
D: Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
C: BEEFY
D: Go get a soda out of the fridge.
C: NICKY
D: But those are my roommate's sodas...
C: BEEFY
D: "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
E: high-pitched mocking
N: Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it on the coffee table. He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare at the Coke.
C: BEEFY
D: You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid - engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
E: CONT'D

D: Release the evil?

S: INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY
C: BILL WALTON
D: What an odd game, folks. The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans.
N: A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING. The REF blows the whistle and makes the travelling signal.
C: REF
D: He's walking, get him a bus!
C: BILL WALTON
D: Oh, another awful call. There is no way that was travelling.
N: Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face.

C: GLOBETROTTER FAN
D: Get your head out your ass, ref! The kids came to see the Globetrotters win.

D: It's time for the Globetrotter's halftime half-court heave throw, where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars!

She is happy being creative. Nicky feels his heart swell as he watches her. ON NICKY He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her. His head bumps the window. She turns, startled. She sees the beaming Nicky.

C: NICKY
D: I can't see you but I can smell you. And you make me feel alive in a way I've never felt before.

C: NICKY
D: Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
N: Nicky resumes floating up.
C: VALERIE

C: VALERIE
D: Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
E: CONT'D
C: NICKY
D: That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.

D: Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
C: VALERIE
D: Yes...

D: ... "The Devil?"...
C: NICKY
D: ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and...well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.

The chief grabs something and starts to pull. Then out of his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the chief's body slumps to the ground.
C: ADRIAN
D: Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
C: JOHN
D: Noon...
N: They look at the clock. It's noon.
C: JOHN
D: ...ish.
E: CONT'D
N: Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.
C: PETER
D: So even though you're not really the chief, we still get the rest of the cash, right bro?
C: ADRIAN
D: You know what you'll get? An indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity.
C: JOHN
D: But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
C: ADRIAN
D: Sure, why not?
N: They high five. Adrian smiles and waits. It is real hot down there. We hear a train coming in the distance. A fan circles slowly. They all wait for him.
C: LADY
D: Food stamps? They should call 'em "dude stamps." Cause ever time I get one, some dude takes it away...
E: mumbling to herself
N: We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way towards them, drunk. Adrian scowls at her.
C: LADY
D: Hey, studs. I'll let you make out with me for a dollar!
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: No thanks...but we'll take that bottle of booze.
E: grabs the bottle, laughs
C: LADY
D: Hey...that's mine.
N: Peter pushes her away.
C: PETER
D: Beat it, ya freak.
N: John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.
C: JOHN
D: Schnapps...
C: PETER
D: Peppermint...alright.
E: takes the bag, swigs
N: Adrian raises his eyebrows. We see that the homeless lady is actually VALERIE in disguise. She looks back, tense. John offers Adrian the flask.
C: JOHN
D: Wanna hit?
N: Hands it to him. He takes it.
C: PETER
D: Drink up. Here's to fifty million clams.
C: ADRIAN
D: To the defilement of Earth and the corruption of its people.
C: PETER
D: Whatever. Knock it back, grab Nicky and let's get outta this hell-hole.
N: Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag. He stops just before it hits his lips. He looks at John curiously.
C: ADRIAN
D: It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
C: JOHN
D: Weed lowers the body temperature. I read that...in, uh...er, science magazine.
E: stuttering
N: Adrian stares at John. He raises the bag again.
C: ADRIAN
D: This liquid will probably quench my thirst. Cool me off.
C: PETER
D: Definitely.
C: JOHN
D: And give you a good buzz.
C: ADRIAN
D: Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
C: JOHN
D: Uh. No it won't?
N: John starts to tremble a bit.
C: ADRIAN
D: Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
C: JOHN
D: Urr...uggg...errr...
C: ADRIAN
D: I'm calling you out, brother...
E: eyes getting red
N: Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John. Nicky/John wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.
C: JOHN/NICKY
D: Urrr...uggh... Oww. Adrian, this is very painful.
E: as Nicky
N: Nicky comes flying out. John's body slumps to the floor next to the chief's. Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see the flask wrapped in paper. He peeks inside.
C: ADRIAN
D: Hello, Cassius.
C: CASSIUS
D: All right. Let me out.
E: O.S.
C: ADRIAN
D: You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
C: CASSIUS
D: You mother...
E: O.S.
N: Adrian hands Nicky the flask.
C: ADRIAN
D: But Cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity. So get in the flask.
N: He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.
S: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER
N: The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal. Beefy starts whining and stops. The cops look down. Beefy raises his leg.
C: COP
D: Oh, he's gotta pee.
N: A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the group. Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.
C: TODD
D: Run, Beefy! Run!
S: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS
N: Adrian stares down Nicky.
C: NICKY
D: I won't drink. You can't make me.
N: Adrian looks over at Valerie. Suddenly she comes flying over to him. He grabs her by the throat. We hear a train coming in the distance.
C: ADRIAN
D: Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
E: Nicky is scared
C: NICKY
D: Let her go.
C: ADRIAN
D: I hear a train coming. Drink.
N: The train sound is coming CLOSER. Valerie looks at Nicky. Nicky raises the flash to drink.
C: VALERIE
D: Don't do it.
C: NICKY
D: I have to, Valerie.
N: We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into ADRIAN'S LEG.
C: ADRIAN
D: Ahhh!
C: BEEFY
D: Now that hurt the both of us.
N: Valerie is able to escape momentarily. Adrian reaches for her, grabbing her. They both spin and fall down onto the tracks. Right into the oncoming train.
C: NICKY
D: Valerie!!!
N: Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from Adrian and tosses her off the tracks. Adrian looks at Nicky.
C: ADRIAN
D: See you in Hell!
N: WHAMM! The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.
S: INT. HELL GATES - CONTINUOUS
N: Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell. He looks around. Confused, there's no Nicky.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY
N: Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass. He sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there. Nicky looks around, alarmed. He seems to be in a mountain vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps. It's gorgeous. Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday cake. Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating down to him.
S: EXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY
N: The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar. After a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.
S: INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS
N: Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA and CHRISTA. They are doing arts and crafts sort of things on a glass table in front of them. They stare at him. Angel rises.
C: ANGEL
D: Oh. My. G-d. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
C: CHRISTA
D: So excited.
C: JENNA
D: She really is.
C: NICKY
D: That's terrific. Now could you ladies point me to the Black Palace? I should check in with my dad...
N: Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.
C: ANGEL
D: I'm sorry, you're just so cute.
C: JENNA
D: Do you have any idea where you are right now?
C: NICKY
D: The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
C: ANGEL
D: Maybe try the opposite of that.
N: The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five. Nicky's confused.
C: ANGEL
D: Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
E: CONT'D
C: NICKY
D: My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
C: ANGEL
D: A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
E: annoyed
C: NICKY
D: My mom wasn't a goat?
C: ANGEL
D: Try an angel.
C: NICKY
D: An angel?
C: ANGEL
D: Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
N: Nicky is floored.
C: NICKY
D: Wow. What...what did she look like?
C: ANGEL
D: Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
N: The GIRLS start laughing.
C: ANGEL
D: I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you. I'm your mom.
E: CONT'D
N: Nicky is even more floored. FLASH. Jenna has taken a picture of Nicky.
C: JENNA
D: I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest look on your face.
C: CHRISTA
D: You're gonna be so happy she did that.
C: NICKY
D: How come you're not older?
E: stunned
C: ANGEL
D: Angels don't get any older, son.
C: JENNA
D: I can't believe you just called him "son."
C: ANGEL
D: Oh my G-d. This is so wild.
N: They laugh. Nicky is quite baffled.
S: INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY
N: Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne. Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand around.
C: DAD
D: I can't see shit. You're all still here, right?
N: Adrian enters. They all cheer.
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Adrian's here. You'll be back to normal in a jiffy, sir.
C: DAD LIPS
D: Yea! I can't believe little Nicky came through.
C: ADRIAN
D: Where's Nicky?

D: He came with you and Cassius, right?
C: ADRIAN
D: I came through that gate alone.
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Sorry, sir, false alarm.
C: DAD
D: Boooo.
C: ADRIAN
D: Somebody explain what's going on.
N: Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: You'll get nothing out of me.
C: ADRIAN
D: Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips.
N: He twists a breast. The Gatekeeper babbles out the information immediately.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely.
C: ADRIAN
D: How much time does Dad have before that happens?
N: Adrian twists hard.
C: GATEKEEPER
D: Thirty minutes. And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power.
N: Adrian throws him down.
C: LUCIFER
D: All boobs and no balls.
C: ADRIAN
D: Thirty minutes. Hmmm. I hope you don't mind if I take a seat while I wait for you.
N: He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.
C: DAD LIPS
D: Ahhh!
N: He pushes Lucifer out of the way.
C: LUCIFER
D: I don't get no respect.
C: ADRIAN
D: Ten thousand years. And I never once got to sit here.
N: He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little. He grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.
C: ADRIAN
D: Wow. And this is just a little taste of my power.
E: CONT'D
C: DAD
D: Hell's gonna bust wide open. Demons, get him out of the chair!
N: The demons approach.
C: ADRIAN
D: Ah-ah. Not so fast, demons. There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested. Anyone interested?
N: The demons stop. Now loyal to Adrian. All except Jimmy.
S: INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY
N: Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.
C: NICKY
D: Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?
C: CHRISTA
D: No, their mother's weren't angels.
C: ANGEL
D: I think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like...
N: There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.
C: CHUBBS
D: Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo lesson.
C: ANGEL
D: Oh, Chubbs. I totally spaced. I'm so sorry. I have company. It's my son, Nicky. My son. Can you believe it?
C: CHUBBS
D: Wow, that's terrific.
C: ANGEL
D: Nicky, this is Chubbs. He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor.
C: CHUBBS
D: You mambo?
C: NICKY
D: I don't think so.
C: CHUBBS
D: Remember, it's all in the hips. It's all in the hips.
N: Chubbs dances as he leaves.
C: NICKY
D: Where did you meet my father?
C: ANGEL
D: It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
C: CHRISTA
D: I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
C: ANGEL
D: Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
C: JENNA
D: He was really conceited.
C: ANGEL
D: But I don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body.
C: NICKY
D: And that made you want to make a baby with him?
N: The Angels laugh.
C: ANGEL
D: Well, I really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time!
N: Her cell-phone rings. She answers it.
C: ANGEL
D: Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back... Oh my G-d, I will call you back, goodbye. That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
E: CONT'D laughs hangs up
C: NICKY
D: Well tell her I said "hi" back.
N: Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.
C: ANGEL
D: I'll call her later.
C: CHRISTA
D: You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
C: JENNA
D: That was so cool.
C: ANGEL
D: That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell. Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here.
C: NICKY
D: How did you see me?
C: ANGEL
D: We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
N: Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in front of them. Angel touches the glass and it turns into a reflection of Earth below.
S: EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT
N: People are rioting in the streets. Looting appliance stores...
C: ANGEL
D: All these good people have totally been led astray.
E: O.S.

E: O.S.
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT
N: People are drinking and smoking and burning things. A large circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist fighting. One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then jumps on her and starts wailing away. The spectators exchange money.
C: ANGEL
D: There's like a three day rave goin' on down there. No on is going to work anymore.
E: O.S.
N: Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian on his throne start to be thrust upwards. Demons swarm around him.
C: ADRIAN
D: Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
C: NICKY
D: Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
E: O.S.

S: EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT
N: Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX HERO DEMONS. He begins addressing the crowd.

C: CARDINAL
D: There is most definitely a Hell! And you're all going there when you die! Which will happen in about fifteen minutes.
S: EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT
N: The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad and they get scared. The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.
C: PREACHER

S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT
N: Nicky dissolves into walking. He checks his pocket to see the ball. He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards him, ready to attack. Nicky closes his eyes and concentrates.
C: NICKY
D: Release...the good.
N: When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around the head of five of the DEMONS. They stop approaching. THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL. And their facial expression changes to happiness. They wave at the butterflies. ANGLE ON MORE DEMONS keep closing.
C: NICKY
D: Release the good...

C: ADRIAN
D: You know, from this angle, you're kind of cute.
C: VALERIE
D: You think so? Why don't you come a little closer and I'll show you a better angle.

E: O.S.
C: NICKY
D: Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.

C: REFORMED DEMON
D: It's true!
E: eating Popeye's chicken
N: Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON. His eyes shoot out an evil ray. The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces. His golden insides splatter on the crowd. The Army of Good is shaken. Another Demon lowers his chicken.
C: ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
D: It's not true?
N: The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away. Nicky steps forward bravely.
C: NICKY
D: Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no choice.
N: Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.
S: EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.
C: NICKY
D: Love lifts me up where I belong.
N: ANGLE ON Crowd reacts. ON HELL STAGE Demons are ready to attack. Adrian waves them off.
C: ADRIAN
D: Not bad, little brother. Let's see what you've got.
N: Nicky thinks, holds out his hands. A rainbow shoots out onto the stage between them. PAUSE. We see that a cute little chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut. ON CROWD The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see this. BACK ON HELL STAGE Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out. He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the baffled chipmunk in one bite. Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of flowers. Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a lawn mower comes by and mows them down. Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage. Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who leaps out and starts beating up on the mother. Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF. The evil Dwarf stops beating her up and holds her hand.
C: ADRIAN
D: Enough. I'm going to kill you with my bare hands.
E: CONT'D

D: Yah you did.
N: CHUBBS is there, too.
S: EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT
N: Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him. Nicky rolls away at the last second. Adrian hits the bed hard and bounces up. Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed. Nicky holds out the flask.
C: NICKY
D: Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the flas...
N: Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face, sending him flying off the bed.
C: NICKY
D: Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!
E: CONT'D
N: Nicky is an expert pillow fighter. He lands a series of awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves. Adrian is dazed. Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air to him. Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face. Adrian goes down hard. Nicky towers over him.
C: NICKY
D: Now will you get in the flask?
E: CONT'D
C: ADRIAN
D: Absolutely not.
N: Adrian turns to his demons.
C: ADRIAN
D: A little help over here.
E: CONT'D
N: A bunch of Demons advance. ON FLAGPOLE We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run over and lowers the five from the flagpoles. ON ADRIAN He looks up and glares at Henry.
C: ADRIAN
D: Henry!
E: CONT'D
N: ON FLAGPOLE Henry's eyes widen.
C: HENRY WINKLER
D: Oh no.
N: He is covered in bees again. BACK ON ADRIAN He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by demons. Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't open his mouth. Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his mouth.
C: ADRIAN
D: Goodbye, Nicky.
N: We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.
C: CASSIUS
D: Come on in, bro.
E: O.S.
N: Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth. Adrian jams the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in. Adrian smiles. But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him. As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:
C: CASSIUS
D: Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.

E: O.S.
C: NICKY
D: Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I heard him keep saying.
E: O.S.
N: We HEAR the sounds of a struggle. All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large circle around the flask. Valerie and the gang make it down off the stage. We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump. The crowd REACTS. A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a horrible thud.
C: VALERIE
D: Nicky!
C: NICKY
D: That was Cassius!
E: O.S.
N: The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road. People get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the street. They root for their side.
C: DEMON

N: John and Peter start beating up the Demon.
S: INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS
N: The Angel and the Friend are praying.
S: EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS
N: We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then the flask stops bouncing. SILENCE. Everybody outside holds their breath. Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY. HOORAY. Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living people CHEER. The student, very happy, opens his kimono. The people and demons near him are grossed out. Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.
C: VALERIE
D: Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
C: NICKY
D: From my dad's side of the family.
N: She laughs and kisses him on the mouth. The crowd CHEERS. But Nicky won't stop kissing her. She starts to struggle for air. Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh. The crowd stops CHEERING. Valerie is waving her arms for help. Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss. Adrian lets her go. And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.
C: ADRIAN
D: What? No tongue?
N: Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns into a GIANT BAT. He lets out a huge roar, then flies around, laughing, scaring people. Valerie runs over and picks up the flask. She looks inside.
C: VALERIE
D: Nicky. Nicky.
E: whispering
N: No response.
C: VALERIE
D: You gotta fly out...I know you can do it. Do it for the butterflies.
E: CONT'D still no response
N: A long beat, then:
C: NICKY
D: Butterflies...
E: O.S.
N: And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands on his feet. Adrian lands and stares down Nicky. The clock is one minute from midnight. Adrian swoops down. Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground. Out of it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.
C: OZZY
D: Hello, New York.
C: JOHN AND PETER
D: Ozzy.
N: They faint. The Bat's eyes go wide in fear. Ozzy grabs the bat, his mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off. Valerie hands Ozzy the flask.
C: VALERIE
D: Put him in, Ozzy.
N: Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.
S: EXT. CLOCK TOWER
N: The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.

D: Aw, man, not again.
C: NICKY
D: Sorry, Henry. Release the Evil.

C: NICKY
D: Do me.
E: CONT'D

C: NICKY
D: What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
C: DAD
D: Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.

N: He pats him on the back.
C: JIMMY THE DEMON
D: Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time for Hitler's punishment.

S: EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK WEST
N: PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and Valerie both pushing it. We see Beefy walking with them. Unbelievably happy. A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.
C: LADY
D: Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.
C: VALERIE
D: Thank yo.
C: LADY
D: Such a little angel.
C: BEEFY
D: Only a quarter, ma'am.
N: She tickles the baby. It giggles and a small stream of fire shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.
C: NICKY
D: Zachariah, say you're sorry.
C: BABY ZACHARIAH
D: Sorry.
E: sounds like Nicky
N: The Lady scurries away. Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue walking in absolute bliss. They pass the Preacher who runs towards us.
C: PREACHER
D: He has spilled his seed! He is multiplying! Beware the progeny of the unholy union! We're all gonna die!
N: The Preacher runs straight into the camera. BLACK. THE END.
