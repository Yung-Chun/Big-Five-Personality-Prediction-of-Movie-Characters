N: "This is a story of one man's fight against himself, knowing he would never win but trying anyway. Every fucking day of it was a war." - Billy Moore Based on a true story
S: INT. SHACK (THAILAND) - NIGHT - ON A MAN'S HANDS
N: strong...raw skin, callused, with hard scar tissue build-up. Knuckles raised and damaged...They unfold a scrap of aluminum foil with a red pill inside it: `YABA'...Southeast Asia's crack cocaine. Zippo sparks beneath the foil -- Huge inhale, fumes rise and steam a glass Pyrex pipe. The Man chokes back, tries to hold the toke. He burps, smoke spurting from his nostrils. Meet BILLY MOORE...mid-20's, rugged, handsome, intense. We HEAR THAI VOICES O.C., sharp tones. Billy moves to a wall of rotted wood planks that divides the shack into two "rooms." He peers through a crack, SEES -- BILLY'S POV: a larger MUAY THAI BOXER in his 30's (ECKACHAI). Barrel chest, crude. A TRAINER holds mitts as Eckachai snaps HARD/LOUD COMBOS of knees/fists. It's intimidating as hell. Billy stares through the cracks...Suddenly, a distant CROWD ROARS. A thousand voices firing at once, and we -- SMASH TO:
S: INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NIGHT - TWO MUAY THAI BOXERS
N: -- both twelve years old, are fighting in a ring surrounded by GAMBLERS. It's loud, primal...A Thai promoter, PAPA (50's) commentates rapid-fire on a mic, his voice echoing over bad speakers as his wife, MAMA, shouts from the crowd... In the ring, the smaller child boxer, NINDAM, is on the attack -- Bodies twisting, grappling, their tiny fists, knees and shins crashing, as--
S: INT. SHACK - BILLY
N: gets ready. Shirt off, his ripped build, battle scarred...He POUNDS a cement post with his bare fist. One blow after another, fists then forearms...Slow, dense thuds, tempering his nerves NOT to feel, as--
S: INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NINDAM + OPPONENT
N: are fighting, jack-rabbit fast. Ringside gamblers shove and shout. Bets exchange, hand signals flashing, odds rising, the violence shocking, as--
S: INT. SHACK - BILLY
N: stands, legs apart and brutally slams a 4x4 BOARD against each of his shins...bruises blossom, shins cracking, NUMBING, again, again and again, and--
S: INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NINDAM
N: jabs Opponent, who reels and drops his guard. Nindam fires a kick to the jaw... ...and Opponent drops cold. Crowd roars. TRAINERS swarm in. The REFEREE lifts Nindam's arm in victory. He smiles. As Nindam exits the ring, two ADULT THAI FIGHTERS climb in... Papa intros each, new odds soar. That fast, while --
S: INT. SHACK - BILLY
N: paces the room, anxiety rising, a caged beast...He pauses... drops his shorts and cup guard, then grips his knees and takes several fast, deep breaths.... Billy...sopping sweat...yanks up his guard/shorts...His hands are shaking as he wraps them in KNOTTED ROPE... We HEAR the SOUND of Eckachai leaving. Billy peeks outside the shack, sees Eckachai and his Trainer walking away... Billy smokes more Yaba. Breathes it deep in his lungs. AND THE DOOR BANGS OPEN. Nindam enters -- Billy spins, quick hides his pipe and foil in a gym bag, just in time; Nindam says something in Thai, grabs a pair of BOXING GLOVES and helps Billy put them on. There's a feeling of urgency, that Billy is late. As Nindam ties and tapes the gloves, Billy is too high/amped and avoids Nindam's gaze. After, both nod, bump fists.
S: EXT. SHACK - NIGHT - FOLLOW BILLY
N: with Nindam, hurrying together beneath a ROARING OVERPASS... they cross a TRASH STREWN ALLEY lined with other shacks, slum tenants drinking and smoking. A MAN sits on a bucket holding a chain with a TINY MONKEY on the end. The monkey wears a plastic doll mask; Two other MEN quickly carry a BLOODIED, UNCONSCIOUS FIGHTER on a stretcher, the opposite way; Billy and Nindam rush past...Sounds of the crowd and music rise...They enter the slum gym... Papa joins them...
S: INT. RING: SLUM GYM - AS BILLY STEPS THROUGH THE ROPES
N: with Nindam and Papa. Adrenaline charged...methamphetamine spiked POV, he darts a look to the crowd: Gamblers trading fistfuls of cash. Mama rallies loudly in Thai...A wired Billy turns to Eckachai in the opposite corner with his Trainer... The crowd getting louder...LOUDER... Nindam and Papa, and Trainer exit the ring. A COW-BELL rings for ROUND ONE. BILLY + ECKACHAI come out firing -- Explosive trades, bone-on-bone impact -- Through BILLY'S HEIGHTENED SENSES, we FEEL the visceral rage-- Mid-round, Billy sees an opening and SMASHES a hook to Eckachai's jaw -- He hits the canvas hard -- Crowd ROARS -- Eckachai gets up -- Billy charges, a wild boar -- two fisted, savage attack to the head and body....Eckachai survives. THE BELL.
S: INT. RING: BILLY'S CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS - BILLY
N: sits. Papa and Nindam, as cornermen, go to work...but Billy's HEART IS RACING, PULSE POUNDING, TOO FAST -- the drugs have zapped his energy. As Billy inhales several sharp breaths, a strange RINGING fades in OVER the following... -- GAMBLERS' hands signals, the odds rising; -- MAMA watching, concerned; -- PAPA and NINDAM shouting instructions to Billy, but he/we can't hear them, only this shrill RINGING... -- ECKACHAI gets off his stool, revived and ready; AND THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO.
S: INT. RING - ROUND TWO - BILLY
N: storms out, tries to put Eckachai away -- Billy SWINGS HEAVILY, THUNDERING HAYMAKERS THAT MISS and MISS -- Nindam, screaming encouragement in Thai as -- Eckachai AVOIDS, then SLAMS an elbow into Billy's eye, jarring and concussive -- Billy staggers, blinking, dazed... Eckachai unleashes a ROUNDHOUSE KICK and Billy's out on impact. BILLY'S HEAD bounces off the canvas -- eyes flash -- brain stem shocked. SENSES CONTORT...He tries to get up as the Ref counts over him. Takes seconds, feels like hours. AS HIS SENSES RECONNECT ...Billy climbs to his feet -- but the Ref counts "Sip!" (ten) The fight's over. The crowd goes crazy, IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR, as -- Billy protests to the Ref, who affirms in Thai. Billy doesn't understand. CORNERMEN pour in. Ref and Billy keep arguing. Nindam gets between them -- Ref violently SHOVES Nindam away, and -- Billy reacts -- hair trigger fast -- HEADBUTTS Ref full in the face. Ref goes down. A nasty cut opens above Billy's eye as he KICKS/STOMPS the Ref with MANIC, UNCONTROLLABLE RAGE -- BOUNCERS/OTHERS swarm over Billy, forcibly restraining him from killing the Ref -- He tries fighting them too -- NOW PAPA FORCES IN -- grabs Billy hard around the neck, yanks him close, sees the drugs in his eyes...And Billy knows it. Billy's POV, SEES: Nindam is crying. SEES: the Ref writhing on the floor, blood oozing through cupped fingers. SEES: the crowd roaring. All of it, a disaster. HOLD TIGHT ON BILLY'S FACE as the RAGE...becomes REMORSE...becomes SELF-HATRED...and PAIN. SMASH TO:
S: EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT - MOVING WITH BILLY
N: as he walks the crowded streets. Face bruised, blood dried through a bandage above his eye... From Billy's DRUGGED POV, IMAGES are kinetic and abstract, a nightmarish KALEIDOSCOPE: Flashing lights. Psychoactive. Multicolored. Shadows pass/undulate. Stray dogs everywhere... SOUNDS are discordant, reverberating: Car horns. Motorbikes. People talking, laughing, shouting... Billy moves through it, focus jumping, blurring. Everything pulsing, pounding, claustrophobic.
S: INT. GO-GO CLUB: RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT
N: Music assaults us. Bass so heavy, it jars our teeth. We're in a seedy sex playground, under harsh neon lights. Strippers on stage, on poles, in cages...Most of them high on drugs, empty eyes, bored. "Coyote Girls" in string bikinis, servicing tourists, all sweating like fiends... AT THE BAR - BILLY slams a double-shot of whiskey. He turns and scans the crowd till he spots a young Thai girl...NINA, 20's, bikini clad...giving a lap dance to a mid- 60's CUSTOMER. To Billy, Nina is impossibly beautiful, an angel, a rose. His anger builds, as the Customer paws Nina's breasts and legs. Nina looks up from her Customer, and sees Billy watching her. Eyes meet...Billy forces a smile...Nina nods to a booth where two YOUNG AUSTRALIAN MEN (20's) nervously wait. Billy slams another whiskey, then--
S: INT. STALL: CLUB BATHROOM - BILLY + AUSTRALIAN #1 + #2
N: are in a stall. The Australians stare at Billy's bruises and bloodied bandage...as he counts out two packets of 100 Yaba, wrapped in cling film. Australians hand Billy cash. Billy counts, pockets it. Gives them the pills. Then Australians #1/#2 watch as Billy cooks up a hit of Yaba. Foil -- lighter -- smoke -- suck...
C: THUNDEROUS FUCKING
D: RUSH
N: SMASH TO: LATER - BILLY works the club... ...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Billy hustling deals...Yaba for cash, deal after deal. Getting HIGHER with customers. Getting HIGHER alone, in between SHOTS OF WHISKEY and BUMPS OF COKE. The music gets LOUDER. The action HEAVIER. More NARCOTIC... BATHROOM. LATER A very intoxicated Billy throws water on his face. He shadow- boxes a few punches in front of a filthy mirror...then stares at his reflection, morosely.
S: INT. MAIN FLOOR: GO-GO CLUB - NIGHT - BILLY
N: looks around for Nina. He finds her in a corner chatting with other girls. THE MUSIC DEAFENING NOW -- We cannot hear what's being said as... Billy heads over. Nina sees his condition and stands up. Billy tries to talk to her. Nina rejects him. Billy takes her by the arm and pulls her close. Nina catches the desperate pain in Billy's eyes, and looks at him, gravely. Billy lets Nina go. She hurries off -- LATER. BILLY is obliterated, sweating profusely as he walks through the club...Only the hardest sex/drug addicts remain. Billy's legs buckle; he uses a wall for support, sparks a JOINT to slow his heart. His distorted POV.....A Stripper slides a cigar from her vagina and pumps out smoke rings. Men applaud, hurl cash on stage. Billy blinks, unsure if he's hallucinating. DANCE FLOOR. LATER Billy dances, alone, trancelike. Releasing himself from himself. Everything rising to a fever pitch. Then, without warning... SOUND CUTS OUT...and Billy starts to weep. OVER THIS LONG, VERY LONELY SILENCE; A STRANGE THUMPING begins, quietly, that carries us into....
S: INT. BILLY'S APARTMENT - PRE DAWN - BILLY
N: sits in a chair, nude, his back to us. Billy is, by now, paralytic. Mouth open, head tilted back, like a corpse...The strange and dull THUMPING builds, like a muted heart beat... boom... boom... boom... Billy mumbles, incoherent. Eyes rolled back, the drugs cocooning him in a blissful isolation from all else. The thumping, louder now... Boom... Boom... Boom... Billy's eyes start to flutter. Tries to open them: can't. Suddenly, loud/startling... BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! Billy snaps alert -- turns to the door. Someone's BANGING on it from the other side; THEN, LOUD VOICES BEGIN SHOUTING IN THAI... Billy peers through the peep-hole: SEES 4 THAI COPS, guns out. He spins, looks at his table -- It's full of EIGHT YABA PACKETS, burned matches, a pipe. He looks at his desk -- it's covered with WEAPONS: a Colt .45, machete, a stun gun, knuckle duster, a pile of cell phones/sim cards, and a Samurai sword. Fuck. POLICE BANG AWAY AT THE DOOR -- Billy quickly grabs a few yaba packets and forces them up his ass -- painfully as -- POLICE KEEP SHOUTING/KNOCKING VIOLENTLY -- BILLY STARTS TO EAT THE OTHER YABA PACKETS: SIX OF THEM. THE COPS KICK THE DOOR. THE SLIDE LOCK HOLDS IT SHUT; BARELY. BILLY CHOKES DOWN THE LAST PACKET DRY. HACKS, SWALLOWS -- ANOTHER KICK. THE LOCK IS ABOUT TO GIVE. While pulling on clothes, Billy takes a fall, gets up, as -- DOOR BREAKS OPEN -- NEARLY OFF IT'S HINGES. COPS STAMPEDE IN AND ROUGHLY THROW BILLY TO THE GROUND -- THEY CUFF HIM, SEARCH HIM. GUNS AT HIS HEAD, A FOOT ON HIS NECK, ALL SHOUTING IN THAI -- COPS #1 + #2 inspect Billy's arsenal, chattering fast, as COPS #3 + #4 find TWIN SYRINGES in a pie tin on the stove. They immediately search for drugs: ripping open cabinets, rifling drawers, kicking out panels, trashing everything they touch... ON BILLY, terrified, sweating.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STAIRWELL: APT BUILDING - PRE DAWN - BILLY
N: is dazed, his cut reopen, bleeds down his face and t-shirt as the Cops walk him downstairs in handcuffs... They slow for a moment, passing the reception desk...where the MANAGER sits, staring at Billy in horror. Billy looks away in shame. They force him outside to...
S: EXT. CITY STREET - PRE DAWN
N: ...a waiting POLICE PICKUP TRUCK. Billy is shoved in the back of the truck, like an animal. And as they drive away, the first streaks of dawn light the horizon over Bangkok... I/E. POLICE PICKUP (TRAVELING) - PRE DAWN - BILLY in back. A POLICE MOTORBIKE follows, headlight glaring bright. Billy watches as various BANGKOK STRATA goes past...Empty streets. Markets opening. Vendors and shops. The city waking, coming to life. Title: A PRAYER BEFORE DAWN
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM: POLICE STATION - DAWN - BILLY
N: We slam in mid-scene. Billy -- sweating, nervous, hands cuffed behind his back, sitting in this room -- as five THAI COPS are all SCREAMING in Thai at Billy. All the weapons and phones from his apartment are spread across a desk, along with his passport...Billy is terrified, doesn't know what's being said. Then, FIRST OFFICER slams down a DOCUMENT before Billy: it's written in Thai.
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: You sign, na!
N: Cop #1 roughly uncuffs Billy, shoves a pen in his hand.
C: BILLY
D: I can't read Thai.
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: SIGN!
N: Billy, scared, shakes his head "no."
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: --SIGN!
N: The Cops all SHOUT again in Thai. Voices ARGUE, OVERLAPPING, GETTING ANGRIER, SCARIER. It goes on and on and on...Billy frozen. Until:
C: BILLY
D: GET ME THE EMBASSY!! GET ME THE FUCKING EMBASSY!!!
E: erupts; top of his lungs
N: BEAT...thick silence.
C: BILLY
D: AY?!
N: First Officer smugs. He smokes a cigarette.
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: You steal, na.
E: re: the weapons + phones
C: BILLY
D: I bought those.
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: Drug dealer.
C: BILLY
D: No.
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: --Yaba: Death for you.
C: BILLY
D: No...fuck no.
N: First Officer glances -- Cop #1, lightening fast, yanks Billy to his feet. First Officer grabs the KNUCKLE DUSTER off the desk and SLAMS a vicious punch to Billy's sternum. Billy loses wind, vomit/pills tunneling up his throat -- He retches violently, gags it back; First Officer and Cops watching, waiting like vultures..... Billy slumps in his chair, trembling hard, about to puke. First Officer slides the confession + pen to Billy, closer...
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: For the weapons and phones.
C: BILLY
D: ...the Embassy...
E: can barely speak
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: They no help you.
E: grins
N: First Officer picks up the knuckle duster again; Billy signs.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOLDING TANK: POLICE STATION - AFTER - BILLY
N: is shoved inside by Cops. The cell is small, dark and foul, filled with 30 or so other sweating bodies. Billy paces intensely, anxiety in his eyes. He waits for the Cops to vanish down a hall. THEN... ...Billy turns around and VOMITS. Yaba packets hit the floor, plastic burned by intestinal acid. Billy drops to his knees, anxiously digs through chunks and fluid to find the Yaba pills. A few others in the cell take notice: ADDICTS, sweating, scratching...They hungrily move toward him... Billy quickly starts to eat the pills. He looks up, sees the Addicts standing over him. Threatening tension hangs. Billy moves back. The Addicts swoop in, devouring the rest of his pills like wolves. Billy watches, helpless.
T: CUT TO:
N: I/E. CAGED PRISON BUS (MOVING) - A WEEK LATER - BILLY rides, crammed among PRISONERS. He's having acute withdrawals. Sweat soaked, in a lot of pain. Even sunlight hurts.
S: EXT. PRISON - DAY - AS THE PRISON BUS ARRIVES
N: Gates open, revealing the compound...High concrete walls and barbed electric fences. Looming guard towers at intervals. The bus lurches forward, rumbling through the gates...GUARDS approach with SHOTGUNS and CATTLE PRODS. The door jerks open: prisoners disembark, all in CHAINS, Billy among them... He gazes around, swallowed by the prison.
S: INT. RECEIVING BLOCK - DAY - BILLY + PRISONERS
N: are herded in. It's dim, narrow. Guards unlock the shackles; chains drop, rattling to the floor...Guards bark orders in Thai and the prisoners shed their clothes, lining up for cursory exams -- mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass... Billy watches, repulsed, as a SKINNY GUARD wearing a latex glove, uses the same finger for each exam, without sterilizing. Suddenly a muffled THAI RING-TONE plays from somewhere. It RINGS, RINGS and RINGS... Guards look around. Prisoners/Billy are still. NO ONE MOVES. The ring-tone keep playing. Then, Skinny Guard looks at a naked Thai (NOK, 20) and orders him to step forward. He squats, coughs...and a CELL PHONE drops out. The name of the incoming caller: "Mom" (in Thai) Cued by Skinny Guard's look, a BULL GUARD lashes out, BATON across Nok's jaw, splaying it open. He goes down in a heap, gash gushing red, defenseless. Billy stares in shock as Bull Guard hails a series of blows, baton beating Nok hard...The room goes DEAD SILENT. Bull Guard walks away, leaving Nok a motionless pulp... Skinny Guard says something in Thai...Billy steps up. Mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass -- demeaning. GUARD #1 hands Billy his clothes. As he puts them on, GUARD #1 extracts a SWITCHBLADE and cuts Billy's pants into shorts.
S: INT. RECEIVING BLOCK (END OF THE LINE) - AFTER - BILLY
N: is seated on the floor...He's dopesick, scared, and looks it. Other Thais sit with him, cross-legged, not looking up. NOW: OFFICER PI SIT steps in, lowering his head to get thru the door. Chief of guards. 50, large, imposing. Without a doubt, the man in charge. He motions Billy to stand. Billy does, staring dead ahead, nervous, shaking...not meeting Officer Pi Sit's stare.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Chi yeng yeng...
E: keep cool heart.
N: Officer Pi Sit taps Billy's chest lightly. And again:
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Chi yeng yeng...
E: keep cool heart.

D: I don't speak Thai.
N: Officer Pi Sit takes a clipboard and pen from Guard #1.

N: Officer Pi Sit looks at Billy: eyes red, nose drips, dried blood caked on his t-shirt and face.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Professional?
C: BILLY
D: ...I fought for tips.
N: Officer Pi Sit walks away, leaving Billy with his troubles.
T: CUT ABRUPT TO:
N: MUG SHOTS OF BILLY: Left, right, center. Holding a Thai slate. Billy is fingerprinted. Billy is weighed on a scale. PHOTOS FLASH: Billy's scars, of which there's many.
S: INT. TRUSTEE CAGE - THAT MOMENT - ON THE CAMERA
N: A visage rises up from behind it: Burmese, 30's, hawk-like features...Meet ELYIAS. Dressed in a clean blue-T/blue shorts, ID around his neck on a silver chain. Elyias is a `Trustee.' As he photos a sickly Billy, Elyias sees old track marks between Billy's scarred knuckles.
C: ELYIAS
D: Can make pain go `way...
N: BILLY
C: ELYIAS
D: Me name Elyias. You sick, yes?
N: Billy nods, in great pain... ...Elyias reaches into the seam of his shorts, pulls out a small object and discreetly slips it into Billy's hand: 50mg of white powder sealed in a 1/4 straw, burned at both ends.
C: ELYIAS
D: Heroin. Good medicine.
N: Billy hesitates. Then he quickly bites the top off the straw, snorts the heroin, and --
T: CUT TO:
N: I/E. VARIOUS CHAMBERS + AREAS - DAY/LATE DAY A series of scenes. Billy high on heroin, as -- 1. Getting his scalp shaved by a prison barber. 2. Bathing at a filthy trough, among prisoners. Billy washes the blood from his face. 3. Waiting in line to piss/shit in open-air toilets. 4. Eating with prisoners, rice and soup, on the canteen floor. Billy stirs his soup: A raw chicken head rises.
S: INT. BUILDING SIX - NIGHT - BILLY
N: is taken by GUARD #2 through corridors that twist and turn. A series of STEEL GATES and BARRED DOORS are unlocked and locked again as they pass. The feeling is endless, unsettling. They finally arrive at --
S: INT. NEWCOMER CELL - NIGHT - BILLY + GUARD #2
N: It's jam packed with over 70 THAI PRISONERS on threadbare blankets, inches apart...Their clothes tattered, some with blood-stained bandages, some in shackles. The chattering is loud, incessant. Stench, unbearable. Flies and mosquitoes ...Like a mass grave. Billy enters, nervous...The cell becomes VERY quiet. Guard #2 barks something in Thai and forces Billy along. He tries to keep a brave face as all the prisoners STARE at him... Seated on a blanket is TIFFANY, a Lady-boy in his 20's, long hair, unshaven, scabbed lips, fake tits, penis bulging under loosened shorts, and a t-shirt w/slogan: "NO MONEY, NO HONEY" Nearby: A BODY lies on a damp, stained mattress. Insects feed on open wounds. A shirt covers his face. Guard #2 points Billy to the hard cement floor, between Tiffany and the corpse.
C: BILLY
D: I'll sit somewhere else.
N: Guard #2 shouts in Thai.
C: BILLY
D: No, somewhere else... I'll sit over there.
E: gestures desperately, hoping Guard #2 understands--
N: Guard #2 shouts louder now.
C: BILLY
D: --Are you off your fuckin' nut? He's dead.
N: Guard #2 throws Billy down hard to the floor, walks away.
C: TIFFANY
D: No worry. Tomorrow he go. Many, many happy.
E: re: the dead body
N: Billy tries to get situated, inches from the corpse.
C: TIFFANY
D: Me name Tiffany.
N: Billy just glares: it's deadly.
C: TIFFANY
D: Relax. I no like farang. Cock too big.
N: Tiffany looks Billy over.
C: TIFFANY
D: You got nice eyes.
C: BILLY
D: -- Keep fuckin' back! And tuck that tackle in or I'll fuckin' rip it off.
E: sharp
N: Tiffany shrugs, buttons her shorts. Then, she slides out a pack of cigarettes.
C: TIFFANY
D: You like smokey?
N: Billy hesitates, then snatches the cigarette. Tiffany smiles, lights it for him. Billy takes a long, deep drag...An awkward beat:
C: BILLY
D: Thanks...You speak good English.
C: TIFFANY
D: I speak nit-noy. I speak a little bit.
N: A naked Indian Prisoner with an orange turban runs past, screaming: "I HAVE GOD POWER! I HAVE GOD POWER!"
C: BILLY
D: So what happened to him?
E: to Tiffany, re: the corpse
C: TIFFANY
D: Who knows? Just die, maybe two hour. You want his bed? All yours.
C: BILLY
D: What about a pillow? Blanket? Some fuckin' food I can eat...?
E: fuck no
C: TIFFANY
D: Need money. Five hundred baht: Lady- Boy sew you blanket. Prison shop sell food. All inmate work for guards or other inmate to survive. No money? You die-- --like him.
E: the corpse
N: And a loud WHISTLE BLOWS.
C: TIFFANY
D: Sleep now, no more talk...
N: Billy lies back, staring miserably up at the lights that will stay on all night...He then sees a SECURITY CAMERA pan/zoom onto him...Ceiling fans RATTLE and WHIR. Thousands of insects BUZZ in the air...Louder, LOUDER, VIOLENT CRESCENDO, THEN -- Billy shuts his eyes.
T: CUT TO BLACK, HOLD, THEN: CUT HARD TO:
N: GUARDS loudly dragging their batons along the bars of each cell, one cell after the next... Billy bolts awake, looks around, disoriented. It's morning;
S: INT. NEWCOMER CELL - MORNING - BILLY
N: and prisoners sit in rows for head count. Each shout a number in Thai, Neung, Song, Sam, etc...It STOPS on Billy; Guard #1 looks up from his clipboard, SHOUTS THAI at Billy. Billy doesn't understand. All eyes on him. GUARD #1 (angrier) Farang, number you!
C: BILLY
D: Six?
N: GUARD #1 In Thai!
C: BILLY
D: I don't know...
N: GUARD #1 Hok!
C: BILLY
D: Hok.
N: GUARD #1 Hok!!
C: BILLY
D: Hok!!
N: Count resumes: others shout. Guard #1 writes it down. Billy watches as two TRUSTEES enter to remove the corpse, now black with rigor mortis. Billy quickly snatches the corpse's blanket, as they carry him away. Prisoners roll up their blankets. Billy does the same. TIMECUT. Water begins pumping from a black pipe and fills up a plastic barrel. Billy watches as other PRISONERS quickly grab large, plastic lemonade bottles from a pile in the corner and fill them up with water. Billy, still sitting there, hears someone giggle...He looks over to see a mentally retarded Thai inmate, filthy, in moldy flip-flops, (NOI, 19) watching him...Laughing. Noi is the only other prisoner not trying to get water. Now, Billy gets up and hurries in to get water. It's rowdy, chaotic: NUMEROUS PRISONERS all yelling in Thai, forcing their way in to fill up their bottles. Billy gestures/talks. No one understands him. Billy finally manages to fill up three bottles for himself.
S: EXT. TROUGHS - MORNING - BILLY
N: in line among prisoners. Billy struggles to hold/carry his bottles of water. One is leaking. He tries to cover the hole. Two THAI PRISONERS in their underwear, leaving the troughs, bump into Billy...and he drops all his water. Billy holds in his frustration...barely.
S: INT. CANTEEN - MORNING - BILLY
N: and prisoners are fed breakfast. Rice and soup (fish skeleton with only the head attached). Billy forces it down.
S: EXT. OPEN-AIR TOILET AREA - MORNING, AFTER - BILLY
N: in line, looking nauseous. He waits, and waits...It's finally his turn. He runs into the stall and vomits.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CORRIDOR - DAY, LATER - BILLY
N: walks down this long corridor alone, then heads out a door...
S: EXT. THE COURTYARD - WIDE - WITH BILLY
N: ...into the chaos and cacophony of the MAIN YARD, a strange world overflowing with bodies: all selling, eating, thieving, drugging, betting, fighting and fucking. MAKESHIFT SHOPS and STANDS throughout: Thai massages, a barber, laundry, food, crafts, flavored water on ice for sale. STATIC, THAI MUSIC drones over speakers... PRISONERS IN SHACKLES play tackle FOOTBALL, argue and fight. Some are in groups (North and South Thai gangs), gambling and hawking wares. Lady Boys on the prowl. A human piranha tank. Above it all, GUARDS watch from the two-story cell block and surrounding towers. ON BILLY -- taking it in...
C: UNSHAVEN LADY BOY
D: Yoo-hoo, farang! You want fuck arse me?
E: off Billy's look
N: The Unshaven Lady-Boy lifts up her top to show giant, fake breasts. Billy ignores. Billy notices a few Westerners together: Australian and Arab. They look at Billy...Billy stares them down. Then; BILLY'S POV -- across the yard...Amidst it all, he spots who he's been looking for: Elyias. As Billy approaches...he sees Elyias with TRUSTEES #1 + #2 in a heated argument with THREE MUSLIMS. It's loud, threatening, lots of shoving, shouting in Thai. Billy stands back, watches. The Muslims storm away. Elyias turns...sees Billy, who discreetly gestures with his hands what he needs... E/I. PRISON LOCKER AREA - DAY - BILLY follows Elyias through a gate, into the hangar-like structure. It's dim, red bulbs hang, row upon row of lockers. Elyias signals Billy to wait, then disappears into the shadows.
C: HOLD ON BILLY
D: alone. Nervous. Above him, Guards loom on balconies. They eye Billy, then move on...Billy waits and waits...It's intense and unnerving. Feels like forever.
N: He decides to leave -- when Elyias suddenly returns with Trustees #1 + #2. Billy looks at them, ill at ease. Then, Elyias slips Billy a lighter, gum foil, and YABA PILL. As Trustees #1 + #2 stand watch, Billy lights up, cooks the drug. Thick smoke rises...Billy hard INHALES, and -- SMASH TO:
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY, AFTER - PRISONERS
N: A FIST-FIGHT breaks out among prisoners. Then ANOTHER. Someone gets STOMPED. Other prisoners crowd around and gamble on who will win.
C: BILLY
D: is alone, motionless and drugged. WE SEE what/how HE SEES...
N: The nude INDIAN PRISONER in the turban runs past, yelling, "I HAVE GOD POWER! I HAVE GOD POWER!..." A BLIND PRISONER with a stick...An OLD MAN in a broken wheelchair...Another prisoner with NO LEGS on a wooden board with tiny wheels pulls himself along...A few PRISONERS being publicly punished, jogging in chains in the scorching heat... The Indian scurries onto a low divider laced with BARBED WIRE. GUARDS shout at him to get down. The Indian keeps moving/yelling "I HAVE GOD POWER," then jumps for the main wall -- hits the ELECTRIC FENCE -- instantly fried. "God Power" gone. The Guards cut the Indian down. Billy just stares, over-fucking-whelmed. Then, a strange calm washes over him...as if feeling the Indian is now free.
S: INT. NEWCOMER CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY
N: lies awake, depressed. Fluorescents blaze, humidity hangs. He looks around at the other prisoners, inches apart. BILLY'S POV: Some are asleep. Most in bad health: open sores, diseases. Tiffany snores beside him. One prisoner mumbles to himself, incoherent. Another cries quietly, his foot badly infected with gangrene. A third prisoner makes a crude weapon out of a SPOON. An OLDER PRISONER sits on the toilet steps, whistle around his neck, on suicide watch. He just stares at Billy, saying nothing... ON BILLY. ALONE. In the distance, faintly rising, we hear atonal CHANTING. The Islamic call to prayer. It drones, hypnotic, a hundred voices bypassing the prison walls... "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akba, Ash-hadu anla ilaha illah Allah," on and on. Billy rises, drapes a wet rag over his head, then moves to the bars and listens...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NEWCOMER CELL - DAYS LATER - PRISONERS
N: do morning head-count for Guard #2. When the count reaches Billy, he yells "Nok!" and the count keeps going...
S: INT. NEWCOMER CELL - DAY - BILLY
N: sits on his blanket. Sweating, nauseous. Leg bouncing rapid. The itch to get high...Tries to fight it. He looks at the nail on his thumb. Starts to bite it. He begins to tear it off with his teeth. He rips it completely off and spits it on the floor. His thumb is torn and bleeding. Billy just stares at it. He hears someone laughing. Billy looks over to see Noi, the mentally retarded inmate...laughing at him again. Then, Billy bursts out the door.
S: INT. PRISON LOCKER AREA - DAY - AS A LIGHTER
N: sparks, a yaba pill boils...and Billy inhales full blast. Trustee's #1 + #2 keep watch. Then, Elyias:
C: ELYIAS
D: Yaba...Tiger. Horse. More you use, more you need...
N: Billy, in some otherworldy place.
C: BILLY
D: The fuck are you on about?
C: ELYIAS
D: Now time, you pay me.
C: BILLY
D: ...I'll pay when I can.
E: slow, high
C: ELYIAS
D: Must pay now. No money, you pay other way...
N: AS BILLY AND ELYIAS MOVE OUT TO THE YARD they/we see a distant GROUP OF MUSLIMS...CHANTING in Muslim prayer, using newspapers for prayer mats: "Allahu Akbar, Allahu, Aakbar..."
C: ELYIAS
D: Muslims. Bad for business... You, boxer-- Boom boom them.
N: Elyias pounds a fist into his hand.
C: BILLY
D: I don't do that. Fuck off.
C: ELYIAS
D: Then me sell your debt to supplier: "the Samurai."
N: Billy follows his gaze to a gang of SIX THAI in a nearby section of the yard. Predatory, junkie-thin, full tattooed. The leader, KENG, face tattooed, holds court.
C: ELYIAS
D: HIV, AIDS, all them... Syringes are swords. Buy drugs and you no pay? Give AIDS to you...
E: off Billy's look
N: Hidden by the rest, A YOUNG SAMURAI sits in the dirt...a full skeletal structure tattooed on his hands. He uses a strange, CROOKED KNIFE to deeply carve/scar his own arms. He looks at Billy. Eyes meet. Billy looks away.
C: ELYIAS
D: Choice yours.
N: As Billy stands there, on the edge of a precipice....
S: INT. PRISON KITCHEN: BUILDING SIX - LATE DAY - THREE MUSLIMS
N: busily work the stoves. Steam and flames rise in the dark as they cook. Malaysian music plays low on a RADIO. They talk in good spirits (AD LIB). THE OLDEST MUSLIM fills a large bowl with food and leaves to feed the others. MUSLIMS #1 + #2 talk/cook. One makes a joke, the other laughs...Then, SOMEONE (O.C.) turns the radio up, LOUD. The Muslims stop, turn...
C: BILLY
D: stands there. STARK STILL. A pain in his eyes: self hatred, remorse. Then, his rapid breathing induces a RAGE, RISING...
N: The Muslims furrow their brows. A split-second heartbeat...just one; AND BILLY ATTACKS. MANIACAL VIOLENCE. So fast, so shockingly brutal it's hard to watch. Malaysian music blares, drowning out the Muslims' screams. Billy destroys them both...till the Muslims lie there, barely breathing, bloody, crippled pulps. MOMENTS AFTER - BILLY'S HANDS are blood covered. He runs water in a sink, fills up a bucket, and sinks his hands into it. The water turns red. Billy stares at it. Silent and tense.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NEWCOMER CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY
N: lies awake, under a white sheet. Empty, sick, defeated. Nowhere to turn. Nothing to hope for. One Prisoner on watch; everyone else asleep. HOLD ON BILLY....staring up at the security camera, his sheet pulled to his chin. He glances at Tiffany, asleep nearby. It's VERY TENSE, VERY QUIET... Prisoner on watch looks around. Then, Billy makes the tiniest flinch. And we see something dark -- moving... A SPOT OF BLOOD FORMS ON THE SHEET. THEN ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...ALL THEM POOLING OUT UNTIL THE SHEET IS SOAKED WITH BLOOD. Under the sheet: BILLY IS CUTTING HIMSELF WITH THE CRUDE SPOON WE SAW EARLIER. CUTTING DEEP. CUTTING EVERYWHERE. FLOODING WITH SELF-HATRED. Billy holds in tears; Suddenly, FEAR sets in. Instant REGRET and PANIC. Billy throws the sheet off...It's an horrific sight...His arms and leg and stomach opened and bleeding. Billy drops the spoon by the inmate he stole it from, waking and startling him. Nearby, Tiffany wakes up too, shocked as -- Billy staggers toward the bars...wounds pumping blood, air leaving him... Everyone begins chattering, incessant Thai; The prisoner on watch loudly blows his WHISTLE. Again and again. Billy grips the bars...Blood and drool and foam in his mouth, he sputters, no words...
C: BILLY
D: Hel-- Hel-- I, I need--
N: Billy, scared, lost-- rears up, SCREAMING---
C: BILLY
D: HEEEEELLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPP!!!!!
C: BLACK.
D: INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - DAYS LATER - BILLY
N: lies still and bandaged in a bed. Other patients in beds: AIDS-ridden, organs failing, runaway sepsis. One can't stop shaking. We're in Death's waiting room. Billy just lies there. Grave emotion. He quietly breaks down, ...then wipes the tears away.
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - LATE DAY - BILLY
N: is walked by two Guards past the ENTIRE INMATE POPULATION (500), gathered in the yard for head-count. All eyes on Billy. Humiliated. Officer Pi Sit watches from a distant balcony as the Guards lead Billy toward a tiny cell, built beneath the prison staircase -- And that is...
S: INT. THE ISOLATION CELL
N: No bed or sink. Just a bucket for a toilet. Paint peels in scabs off the ceiling, only three-feet high. Porno mag photos are stuck to a wall, among dozens of markings from previous prisoners counting down days. Billy grips the bars, on his knees, staring across the yard. THE WHISTLE BLOWS and all prisoners return to their cells. Officer Pi Sit returns to his office. WE HOLD ON BILLY for the longest time...alone with the empty courtyard. Only a large BUDDHA STATUE remains; incense and candles burning, it's solemn face staring at Billy. Billy staring back. And as the sun starts to dip...In the distance, two GUARDS exit a cell, followed by a group of MEN...well built, full tattooed, shackled and chained...GYM BAGS in hand and BOXING GLOVES tied around their shoulders. The Boxers and Guards go past, not looking at Billy... Billy watches them go. Forlorn. Numb.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SECTOR 5: CORRIDOR - DAY - BILLY
N: Days have passed. Billy -- bearded, filthy -- and three THAI INMATES are led down a corridor.
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - DAY - BILLY, THAI #1, #2 + #3
N: enter this huge, crowded cell, deemed maximum security. Guards slam the bars behind them. It's dark, foul. Wet clothes hang on lines. Bottles of murky fluids. It's a SAMURAI CELL. Wall-to-wall packed w/INMATES, tattooed from head-to-toe, many in shackles. Surveillance cameras...The air itself is dangerous. Billy and the three Thai Inmates stand before the "cell boss," we saw in the yard: KENG. He sharply barks the rules in Thai. Billy's quiet, doesn't like the tone. A few Samurai laugh. As Billy looks for a space to sit, one Samurai gets up...KIAW (30, Thai, body and lips tattooed, wearing shackles). He shouts in Thai at a sleeping Samurai, "Bie!" (move!) then kicks him hard in the ribs to make room for Billy. Then Kiaw looks at Billy and smiles...
C: KIAW
D: Okay, farang. You sleep here.
N: Billy sits.
C: KIAW
D: I am Kiaw.
C: BILLY
D: Billy.
C: KIAW
D: Me hear of you...
E: smiles
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, what'd you hear?
C: KIAW
D: That you crazy foreigner. Farang, ba. I like that. Kiaw friend to you...
N: SUDDEN COMMOTION. EVERYONE TALKING. Billy looks up to see the three Thai Inmates he came in with are clutching the cell bars as Samurai take turns kicking them from behind.
C: KIAW
D: Initiation...not for Westerner.
N: When it's over, the three Thais celebrate. Samurai embrace them. Billy watches, feeling oddly rejected.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHOWER AREA - MORNING - BILLY + KIAW
N: wait in a long cue of prisoners leading up to the troughs. When it's their turn: five cups water, ten seconds soap, four cups water; Next prisoner's turn. After, Billy and Kiaw shave, using dull razors and sharing a small plastic bowl of water. Kiaw gives Billy a clean t-shirt. Billy puts it on.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LAUNDRY AREA: PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - A SEA OF WHITE
N: linen sheets, clipped to lines, undulates in the breeze. Go behind it TO REVEAL: small clusters of junkie prisoners, using makeshift rigs out of Bic pens to boot heroin.
C: BILLY
D: watches, nervous and horrified as Kiaw builds a "syringe": taking apart a Bic pen, then using a lighter to burn/melt one end of the stem around a needle;
N: As Kiaw breaks open a straw of heroin and mixes it with water in a bottle cap... Kiaw sucks the heroin mix up through the "syringe," then forces the needle into his vein, and blows the heroin in; Billy is shocked.
C: KIAW
D: Now you.
C: BILLY
D: Fuck that.
C: KIAW
D: Best high like this.
N: Billy, ill at ease, contemplates, then.... ....we HEAR a distant chorus of SOUND, IN THE DISTANCE: rhythmic POUNDING, chains JANGLING, ropes WHIRRING... It gets Billy's attention...he's unsure what it is;
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - RIGHT AFTER - WITH BILLY
N: as he starts thru the yard...He moves through the chaos, not saying a word... The SOUNDS get louder as we get closer, Billy following it... drawn to it, now arriving at... A PRISON BOXING GYM Billy enters...Its cage enclosed, decrepit, yet full to bursting with MUAY THAI BOXERS at work: SKIPPING ROPES, POUNDING BAGS (Two on each bag alternating kicks), HAMMERING MITTS and PADS, SPARRING and SHADOWBOXING -- a great machine of perpetual violence. A DESK GUARD sits, reading a newspaper. BILLY'S FACE as he edges forward, transfixed. Everything that's happened writ deep in his eyes. Everything he did wrong. All he'll never become. Wounded and frightened by the abundance of strength around him... The Boxers are aware of him now. They stop training. And Billy freezes. The Boxers staring at him. Every one of them, dangerous. Billy staring back. SCARY SILENCE. And just like that.... AN ANGRY THAI MAN SPRINGS INTO FRAME, STARTLING US -- SHOVING BILLY BACK AND SHOUTING AGGRESSIVELY IN THAI --
C: BILLY
D: --I'm sorry...sorry, I didn't--
E: stumbling backwards
N: The Man (NAN, 40's) keeps shouting/driving Billy out --
C: BILLY
D: Wait, I'm a fighter! I'M A FIGHTER!!
N: A LIGHTENING FAST SHOVE and Billy's balance goes -- He falls completely out of the gym, lands on his back, on cement. Nan yanks the gate SHUT. Locks it with a SNAP. Billy looks at him, dumbstruck. Nan stares through the gate, smoking a cigarette. Then turns, disappearing into the gym. OFF BILLY. Mad. Stung. Confused. Roaring sounds of the gym
T: resume, and we CUT TO--
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY
N: sits alone, head in hands, feeling sick. Other prisoners ignore him. A Guard looms on a balcony. Billy wipes sweat, stands and gestures to him:
C: BILLY
D: I need a doctor.
S: INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - DAY - DOZENS OF PRISONERS
N: line up to a medical hatch, where TRUSTEE #3 hands out little cups of pills, with little cups of water. Other TRUSTEES mill. Billy, among the queue, ill, says to anyone in line --
C: BILLY
D: What're they knocking out up there?
N: In front of Billy, an enormous NIGERIAN INMATE answers --
C: NIGERIAN
D: Tramadol. Good for pain.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah? It's enough to do damage?
C: NIGERIAN
D: Not like Dilaudid or Roxinol. But good enough.
C: BILLY
D: I'm Billy Moore. What's your name?
E: slight laugh
C: NIGERIAN
D: Black Dildo.
C: BILLY
D: "Black Dildo--?" Got a Christian name, haven't you?
C: BLACK DILDO
D: God name me this. I am Black Dildo.
E: NIGERIAN
C: BILLY
D: Well you know your painkillers, Black Dildo. How much they charging for it?
N: Black Dildo regards Billy. He doesn't look well.
C: BLACK DILDO
D: Free to all. Help get prisoners clean.
N: Billy nods; Black Dildo reaches the hatch. Trustee #3 hands him a cup. Black Dildo swallows his pills, then water. Billy's turn...Trustee #3 hands him a cup: it's empty.
C: BILLY
D: Where's me pills?
N: TRUSTEE #3 You pay.
C: BILLY
D: "Pay?" The hell you mean? It's free, isn't it?
N: TRUSTEE #3 You, farang. Pay five pack cigarette.
C: BILLY
D: -- What?!
N: Prisoners in line grumble, getting impatient. Another TRUSTEE #4 approaches...so does Black Dildo;
C: BLACK DILDO
D: Come back tomorrow. You no want trouble here.
C: BILLY
D: No, no. It's alright, Dildo. I got this...
N: The situation is now very dangerous. Billy, a volcano of violence, is about to erupt.
C: BILLY
D: Now look, you lil' fuckin' cunt-- There's people waitin' here...I don't want no trouble, so play fuckin' nice and give me my pills.
N: Trustee #4 shouts something in Thai.
C: BILLY
D: What'd he say?
N: TRUSTEE #3 No pill for you!
C: BILLY
D: I NEED these pills--
N: Trustee #4 shouts in Thai again. TRUSTEE #3 --He say you go now! Billy, rattlesnake strike, grabs Trustee #3's head and slams it into the wall -- plaster splits -- startling us. Billy snaps a hard right-left across #3's snout, blood sprays. And all hell breaks loose. Prisoners yell and scatter. Trustee #3 screams, cups his nose, gushing. Trustee #4 and another, #5, grapple with Billy.
C: BILLY
D: GET OFF! GET FUCKIN' OFF ME!
E: to Trustees
N: Billy breaks loose and sinks his TEETH into #4's throat. Blood spurts, #4 howls. Billy bites down even harder. Even by his own brutal standards, it's shocking. Trustee #5 chops away at Billy's head, who takes the pain. Trustee #4 collapses. Billy hurls Trustee #5 to the floor. A WHISTLE blows in the distance. Blood is everywhere: On Billy's clothes/face/mouth. He looks at the injured Trustees, smiles bloody teeth, crazed and raises both middle fingers.
C: BILLY
D: Three on one, shitbags!
N: Black Dildo grabs Billy and restrains him in a rear/jaw headlock.
C: BLACK DILDO
D: STOP! CALM DOWN! NO MORE!
N: Billy, straining with anger, in Black Dildo's grip. A DOZEN MORE TRUSTEES arrive with BATONS shouting in Thai.
C: BILLY
D: Okay! Alright, Dildo. I'm calm. I'm calmed down.
N: The Trustees w/batons look at the Trustees that are injured. They see the blood, then the bite marks. Trustee #6 turns to Billy and grins. TRUSTEE #6 Hey, farang. You no good boxer. Fight very bad. Billy, ADRENALINE SURGE at the insult -- SCREAMS and breaks loose again, charging Trustee #6. The other Trustees knock Billy down with their batons and bury him.
S: EXT. CONTROL SECTION - AFTER - ON THE DOOR
N: it slams open. Two TRUSTEES throw Billy on his face, like a sack of raw meat. Trustees go back inside... Billy rolls to his back, leaving a blood mask on the ground. Billy lies there...bloody and swollen. Eyes, purple slits. The sun beating down on him, flies nipping at him, barely able to breathe... Then, a YOUNG WOMAN approaches, blocking out the sun. Early 20's. A paige-boy hair cut. We see her in SILHOUETTE...
C: BILLY
D: ...help me...
E: barely a whisper
N: The Woman gently dabs Billy's wounds with a wet rag, cleaning the blood. When she leans closer, her FACE comes into light. Her name is JOM. And she's a man...in bright red lipstick.
C: JOM
D: You okay?
N: Billy isn't.
C: JOM
D: Face look very bad.
N: Billy blinks.
C: JOM
D: No worry now. Me name Jom. I help you.
N: Jom sits Billy up, continuing to nurse him. After a moment, she helps Billy get to his feet. Billy holds onto Jom for support...step-by-painful-step, slowly making their way toward a looming ADMIN. BUILDING in the center of this fenced-in compound. Suddenly GUARDS #1 and #2 arrive, and shout at Jom in Thai. Jom shouts back. Arguing ensues. She's protecting Billy. Guards roughly grab Jom and throw her aside. Billy collapses again.
S: INT. ADMIN BUILDING: CHAIN ROOM - DAY, LATER - AS A HAMMER
N: SWINGS DOWN onto an iron cuff, around Billy's ankle. WIDEN. And Billy's leg is set on an anvil. A BLACKSMITH hammers a bolt through the clasp. Officer Pi Sit stands by with the Guards. Blacksmith hammers ANOTHER CUFF around Billy's ankle, then runs two ENORMOUS 6 KG CHAINS between shackles... Billy stands, bound, shackled...his swollen eyes, defiant. Officer Pi Sit signals to the Guards and Blacksmith to leave. Then, Officer Pi Sit exhales heavily, glares at Billy...
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Why are you so fucked up?
N: Billy says nothing, inwardly tense.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Disappoint me, William Moore. Fight like mad dog, no good. Must be same- same like Buddha.
N: Billy is silent. Officer Pi Sit slowly circles him...
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: You say you are "boxer."
C: BILLY
D: Are you sayin' I'm not?
E: defiant
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Why you need drugs?
C: BILLY
D: Who said I "need" it?
N: Pi Sit stops. Stares. Cold. Billy stands there. All his failures, like shrapnel, moving through his heart...
C: BILLY
D: -- I've got a lot of bad shit in me head...I don't want to think about. When I use, I don't hear it.
E: concedes, honest beat
N: Pi Sit looks at Billy: sees the hard miles in his eyes. The pain in his voice.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: If you want fight, you should fight in the ring. But you must deserve it.
N: Billy is silent;
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Behave, William Moore. Chi yeng yeng...and maybe real fighters can teach you something.
C: BILLY
D: ...I can't box with chains on...
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: For three months, get used to it.
S: EXT. CONTROL SECTION - HOURS LATER - BILLY
N: waits alone, chained and shackled, seated against a wall. In the b.g., two LADY-BOYS (MAY and CHAR) give massages to a pair of Guards on a shaded veranda of the Admin. buiding. Now, Jom approaches Billy...
C: JOM
D: So you like fight?
N: Billy is quiet, morose.
C: JOM
D: -- Officer Pi Sit, good man. He protect us. And now, he try and protect you...
E: leans in close to Billy
N: Billy is silent. He touches his lip: it still bleeds.
C: JOM
D: Here, I feel safe. I go outside compound,-- danger!
E: MORE
C: JOM
D: Four thousand man want boom boom me...'cause I have pussy. Am real girl...
E: CONT'D
N: A BEAT. Billy just stares at her, unsure what to say.
C: JOM
D: I spend next thirty-five years of my life here...very much afraid. I had boyfriend, say he love me. Then he lie and cheat, and I slit his throat when he beat me.
E: beat
N: Billy is silent.
C: JOM
D: Do you have girlfriend in prison?
E: smiles
N: Just then, two Trustees arrive to escort Billy from the compound. He struggles to rise, chains rattling...glancing back once at Jom as he leaves...
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY, LATER - BILLY
N: walks with great difficulty through the yard, flanked by Trustees. The iron cuffs cutting into Billy's ankles...step by step... A few Samurai hang around...Billy keeps walking.
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - LATE NIGHT - BILLY + KIAW
N: face to face, both high, smoking heroin, lying under blankets to avoid being seen by Guards. The effects of the drug hit Billy hard. He crawls out of the blanket amidst a plume of SMOKE. Slumps back against a wall, sweating, heart pounding, eyes/lungs burning... Thru Billy's haze he/we see/hear...a Thai pop-music video playing on a small tv, sealed to the wall...Fans whirring... Kiaw's lighter sparking under a blanket...Smoke and heat rising... Then, cell boss, Keng, sits up and signals to other Samurai. One by one, three then four then five get up, and quietly scale over other prisoners sleeping...making their way toward the Young Thai inmate (we saw initiated earlier). Billy stares, unsure what's happening. Suddenly, Keng and five Samurai throw themselves onto the Young Thai, cover his mouth and rape him. Billy tries to move. Can't. The attack's silent. Terrifying, AIDS infecting. The Thai pop-song keeps playing...
S: EXT. OUTDOOR KITCHEN: PRISON COURTYARD - MORNING - COOKS
N: crack eggs, scramble, pour, flip and fold them. The stoves are electric. PRISONERS wait in line for omelets, then move to a gallery of lawn chairs and eat. BILLY + KIAW sit on buckets, using toothbrushes to scrub their ankles beneath their shackles. Their eyes are hollow, black circles from weeks of abuse. Track marks visible. Billy scrubs roughly...His ankle starts to bleed. He keeps scrubbing. Suddenly the sound of HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS WHISTLING, making CAT-CALLS in Thai. Billy and Kiaw look up -- Jom -- in a long wig and makeup -- is being escorted through the yard by TRUSTEES. She swings her hips with exaggerated sexiness, like a peacock flaunting it's feathers. Billy is surprised at how attractive she looks. Jom sees Billy, waves and calls out to him:
C: JOM
D: Hey, farang ba! You think me beautiful?
N: Billy just watches. No words. Jom enters a shop with an encaged window for protection. The Trustees lock her in. Ready for business...
S: EXT. PRISON SHOP AREA: COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY
N: is trying to find cigarettes from one of the shops and stands. It's loud, unruly: DOZENS OF PRISONERS all bargaining, arguing, shoving at once. Billy gestures over the noise. Every SHOP OWNER refuses him.
C: ANGLE, JOM
D: behind the counter of a CAGED-IN SHOP. She's selling cigarettes, toiletries, coffee, homemade Valentine cards, etc, along with May and Char.
N: Deep in the crowd, Jom sees Billy -- frustrated, vulnerable. Billy notices Jom watching, and works his way toward her.
C: JOM
D: Hello. How I can help you?
E: smiles, flirtatious
N: Billy, getting bumped on all sides, tries to hold ground.
C: BILLY
D: ...cigarettes...
C: JOM
D: Five dollar.
C: BILLY
D: Can I buy `em on credit?
E: pause, low
N: Jom looks at him.
C: BILLY
D: -- I'm expecting some cash from me mum.
E: lying
N: Jom regards him, then opens her ACCOUNT BOOK.
C: BILLY
D: William Moore.
C: JOM
D: I know...
N: She writes down Billy's name with a baht amount.
C: JOM
D: I give you fifty dollar credit. Pay me back when you can?
N: Billy nods, embarrassed. Jom slides him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES.
C: BILLY
D: -- I never thanked you for fixin' me head. So...
E: pause, then
N: Billy nods "thanks."
C: JOM
D: You want, I can be your sexy girlfriend...
N: Billy's uncomfortable. VERY uncomfortable. So Jom just smiles and then he leaves. Jom watches him go.
S: EXT. SECTOR 5 CELL - NIGHT - BILLY
N: and a THIN SAMURAI trade cigarettes for straws of heroin. LATER - BILLY is hunched under a blanket. He cuts two lines of heroin on a bucket. Billy SNORTS one line, quickly switches nostrils, SNIFFS the other, both barrels. Billy's eyes press shut, to ESCAPE, for a moment. SILENCE... precious silence... Billy lifts an edge of the blanket, peers out: Thin Samurai sits there, smoking a cigarette, watching him. AMBIENT SOUND/REALITY...SELF-HATRED comes back; Thin Samurai smiles, puts the cigarette out on his tongue. Then he eats it. Billy just looks at him. Then -- REVEAL NOW, across the cell...the YOUNG SAMURAI w/tattooed hands. His head is bowed as Keng uses the CROOKED KNIFE we saw earlier to shave Young Samurai's scalp...Slowly, methodically...hair falls in bits, revealing Young Samurai's scalp is full tattooed with the image of a DRAGON. Billy watches this ritual, nightmarish and surreal -- I/E. SECTOR 5 CELL - DAWN - BILLY is alone at the bars. Arms slung over the crossbars, smoking a cigarette. Quiet, sullen. It's DAWN - faint Buddhist and Muslim CHANTING O.C. Kiaw hides a handful of heroin straws in a SHAMPOO BOTTLE. Billy notices. Kiaw looks at him, smiles. Billy picks up the carton of cigarettes. Only one pack left. When he opens it, he finds a small NOTE tucked inside between cigarettes. Billy mumbles low, as he reads --
C: BILLY
D: "Hi Billy.
E: to himself MORE
C: BILLY
D: You missing me, yes or no?...I want you be a good man for me, Billy. I can be a good person for you too...Can't say love now, but when everything okay, you will be the one, my boyfriend."
E: CONT'D
N: At the bottom of the note, a lipstick mark. Signed: "Jom" Billy's jaw tenses. Silent. Disturbed. Then, we hear the sound of MEN RUNNING. A lot of men. Billy looks up: THE MUAY THAI BOXING TEAM is doing wind sprints in the yard. Back and forth, powerful as horses, no one out there but them. Billy watches. One man coaching, looks up: NAN, smoking a cigarette. Eyes meet. And as the team keeps running... The chanting grows louder... Louder... Fearful... CUT TO: BLACK. A LOUD SIREN SCREAMS ACROSS THE PRISON GROUNDS......
S: INT. SECTOR FIVE CELL - LATE NIGHT - BILLY
N: and all his cellmates bolt up. Billy looks at Kiaw:
C: KIAW
D: Someone killed...
N: SMASH TO:
S: EXT. PRISON WALKWAY - LATE NIGHT - MOVING SHOT: ELYIAS
N: lies mortally wounded -- the CROOKED SAMURAI KNIFE plunged into his chest, as Trustees quickly push him on a cart to-- THE COURTYARD where Officer Pi Sit + Guards have also found the corpses of Trustees #1 + #2, blood sodden, knife wounds bleeding out. Guards HEAVE the corpses onto PUSHCARTS. An ENRAGED Officer Pi Sit shouts in Thai at Guards and Trustees, and we--
C: SMASH TO:
D: PRISON RAID SEQUENCE
N: GUARDS in riot gear -- move FAST and LOUD, charging into cells with batons, flashlights and DOGS -- shouting rapid-fire Thai as -- PRISONERS are violently grabbed, yanked out -- Their cells are ransacked -- bedding and pillows ripped apart -- bins dumped over -- false bottoms kicked out...sifting, searching...
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - THAT MOMENT - BILLY
N: peers through the bars to get a glimpse of what's happening. We HEAR distant mayhem. Batons hitting flesh. Men screaming insanely. Billy turns to see all of the Samurai sitting in silence. Cross-legged, waiting. Only Keng looks at Billy...and gestures for him to stay quiet. The sound of beatings/screaming intensifies as the raid gets closer to their cell. Billy tries to swallow his fear, but it's impossible. We begin hearing FOOTSTEPS somewhere. Lots of them. Coming hard and fast. HEAVY KEYS jangling. Billy steps back. He blinks.
T: CUT TO BLACK/THEN ABRUPT TO:
N: THAT MOMENT - GUARDS crash in. So fast, so frightening, giving us only glimpses -- BILLY + KIAW and other Samurai are roughly grabbed and thrown in line. A few Samurai protest/spit back -- Dogs bark and bite them -- Guards kick and punch them -- smashing batons across Samurai bare backs with relentless force. Billy sees another Samurai being dragged out by the hair. Contraband hits the floor: cell phones, chargers, pocket knives, spikes, shivs, drug paraphernalia, porn mags; Guards keep shouting -- Terrified prisoners are marched along landings -- down stairs -- Billy and Kiaw among them.... Chaos everywhere, impossibly violent. Then;
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - PRE DAWN - BILLY + KIAW +
N: the ENTIRE PRISONER POPULATION stand in rows, nude, their clothes on the ground. For Billy, and those in shackles, their shorts/underwear are pulled to their ankles. SILENCE IS DEAFENING. BRIGHT LIGHTS FLOOD THE YARD. GUARDS body-search the prisoners one by one, then search their clothes. The dead bodies of Elyias, Trustees #1 + #2 displayed for all to see. Billy sees Nan and the Boxing Team amongst prisoners, also nude. Nan doesn't notice Billy. Then, TRUSTEES push Jom, May and Char to a distant corner, wearing bras and panties. For the first time, we see Jom without any makeup on. She looks at Billy, his pale, naked body amongst tattooed Samurai. Jom stares...Billy looks away...it's awkward.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: walks the line, tapping his baton against his leg, scanning prisoners' faces, a cold anger in his eyes...
N: A paranoid Kiaw VERY SUBTLY kicks his shirt on the ground in front of Billy...but Billy doesn't notice. The Guards are getting closer, roughly searching prisoners and their clothes. THEN Bull Guard arrives/searches Billy: mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass. Bull Guard grabs Kiaw's shirt off the ground (thinking they are Billy's). Billy SEES they aren't his... Bull Guard folds back the seam of Kiaw's shirt: REVEALING A HIDDEN POCKET stitched inside. Billy glances at Kiaw in disbelief...Kiaw just stares ahead. Bull Guard rips the pocket out, finds: STRAWS OF HEROIN -- then shouts in Thai to Officer Pi Sit. Officer Pi Sit walks over. Takes the heroin. Bites open one straw, tastes the powder. Officer Pi Sit glares at Billy.
C: BILLY
D: Those aren't mine.
N: Kiaw says something in Thai. Bull Guard shouts angrily back. Kiaw talks/gestures to Billy -- says the heroin is his; Billy shakes his head "no," frantic, terror stricken. Officer Pi Sit just keeps staring at him. As Bull Guard shouts in Thai, Billy snatches the shirt from his hands and tries to put it on. Too small. Doesn't fit. A SLEEVE rips, then hangs off. Bull Guard goes silent. Officer Pi Sit looks at Billy and Kiaw. A VERY SCARY, VERY INTENSE MOMENT..... Officer Pi Sit turns, signals sharply to the Trustees. IN A FLASH, the Trustees grab Kiaw and fiercely hurry him out of the yard. Kiaw protests, frantic-- as Billy watches, shackled, still. Trustees wrestle Kiaw to an upstairs office and shut the door. There's a sudden SQUALL OF FEEDBACK over the LOUD SPEAKERS, followed by SOUNDS of footsteps scuffling -- A door being slammed -- A chair being dragged -- Kiaw being interrogated -- IT GOES ON AND ON FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN JUST STOPS. SILENCE. Then the SCREAMING begins. Billy and the prisoners are frozen, listening to the SOUND OF KIAW'S BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAMS as TRUSTEES SAVAGELY BEAT HIM WITH BATONS. I/E. - VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS + PRISON LOCATIONS - THAT MOMENT The beating/screams/sobs broadcast across the entire prison.
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - BILLY + PRISONERS
N: all staring at the speakers: NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS. HOLD ON BILLY, this just awful moment.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LARGE ANTECHAMBER - DAY
N: A rather dark room, or lobby, filled with inmates lounging and smoking cigarettes. Billy is high, among them. The antechamber is connected to a small cell. And behind those bars: a dressed up Jom is singing Karaoke. May and Char sing back-up, lyrics roll on a shitty tv, as Jom sings into a microphone. It's a slow, very seductive Thai BALLAD...
C: BILLY
D: his eyes glazed, watching Jom through the smoke...as do all the other inmates. The room pulses slowly. Billy is totally captivated by Jom's singing and stares without blinking.
N: Jom looks right at Billy, as if singing just for him. With the effects of the drugs -- DREAMLIKE, SURREAL -- Jom becomes emotional as she sings, appearing like a star...an angel... For Billy, forgetting the prison surroundings for just this moment, he's trancelike...mesmerized...as if he and Jom are alone. Even the cell bars disappear; When the song ends, Billy continues watching Jom and everyone else loudly APPLAUDS.
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAYS LATER, MORNING - WIDE
N: The usual chaos and activity. We hear a TRUSTEE'S VOICE over the loudspeaker:
C: TRUSTEE'S VOICE
D: William Moore, yat yeim...William Moore, yat yeim
N: No sign of Billy. Instead, he --
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - MORNING - BILLY
N: lies inert on his blanket, alone in the cell. A shirt covers his face. Kiaw's shampoo bottle is open, empty, next to him.
C: BULL GUARD
D: stands over, puts a boot on Billy's chest. No response. He yanks the shirt off Billy's face.
N: Billy's mouth is wide, eyes rolled back. Looks like a corpse. Bull Guard lifts Billy's head, shakes it. Then harder. Billy is totally limp. Bull Guard gives him a VIOLENT KICK to the ribs. Billy's eyes snap back in place. He wakes up, as if from a coma. Bull Guard shouts something in Thai. Billy doesn't get up, zombie-like. Bull Guard yanks him to his feet, throws a sky-blue uniform shirt on him, and drags him out of the cell.
S: INT. VISITING AREA - MORNING - BILLY
N: is dragged in by Bull Guard, chains jangling. He's dumped onto a stool before a STEEL MESH PARTITION. Billy almost falls over. Bull Guard sits him up straight. Billy is badly disheveled, bloodshot eyes, grey skin, unshaven, beyond high. To his left and right, PRISONERS shout back and forth to VISITORS on the opposite side -- ten feet apart -- divided by bars/mesh. A BABY cries. It's madness. Like talking across a freeway. BILLY'S POV swims for a moment to an OUT OF FOCUS VISITOR seated on the other side of the mesh... As Billy blinks, strains to see, the Visitor comes INTO FOCUS revealing: NINDAM (the young boy from the opening scene.) He stares at Billy in shock. Shock of his decay. Shock of time gone by. Billy looking back, his bloodshot eyes moving down to: BILLY'S POV -- NINDAM'S HANDS, holding a small TROPHY. He grips it nervously, speaking slow and distinct; unsure if Billy understands:
C: NINDAM
D: ...Billy...you hear me?
N: Billy's mouth moves: no words come out.
C: NINDAM
D: I win tournament. In Bangkok. Muay Thai, number one.
N: Billy tries to respond. Strains to focus...Can't. Then, Nindam sadly sets an OLD GYM BAG on the divider: Billy's gym bag.
C: NINDAM
D: This from gym locker. We wait long time. Can no more keep for you... Sorry.
E: upset
N: Billy clenches his jaw-- a flood of emotion roils inside him. Nindam FEELS it too, trying to be brave...
C: NINDAM
D: Next time I fight...when you leave here, me want you walk me to ring.
N: Billy tries to smile. It falls quickly;
C: NINDAM
D: ...bye, Billy...
E: low, tears welling now
N: Billy nods -- fighting back tears. Nindam, staring at him. Then quietly, as if whispering a prayer...
C: BILLY
D: bye.
N: As Billy stands, Bull Guard searches him, checks his chains. Nindam watches desperately. After a moment, Billy turns back to look at Nindam... ...He's gone. Billy, seeing it...feeling every fucking bit of it...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - MORNING, WEEKS LATER - BILLY
N: Time has passed. He sits alone, clean shaven, writing a letter in pencil. We see GLIMPSES of his crude, childlike handwriting: "...I know how difficult this is...""...I made a mistake..." "...no one to blame but myself..."
S: INT. CHAIN ROOM - DAY - BILLY
N: is having his chains removed by the Blacksmith. Officer Pi Sit stands nearby with Bull Guard; After the shackles are pried off, Billy stretches his legs. The lack of weight is relieving. Bull Guard signals Billy to sit on the floor. He does, then;
C: BILLY
D: I want to fight.
E: to Officer Pi Sit
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: You already did that.
C: BILLY
D: I mean with the team. I need to fight...
N: Officer Pi Sit stares.
C: BILLY
D: You understand me.
N: BEAT.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: It's you who no understand. Boxing come with good behavior, long time. We have prison tournament each year, government allowed. A chance for boxers at life, privilege...and honor. You've earned nothing, William Moore.
E: off Billy's look pause
C: BILLY
D: So let me fight. I need it to change. That's something...
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: No.
N: BEAT; Billy reaches into his pocket, pulls out a folded addressed envelope.
C: BILLY
D: Will you mail this?
N: Pi Sit doesn't move.
C: BILLY
D: It's for me mum.
N: Pi Sit takes the envelope. Then he pulls out a SWITCHBLADE and swiftly cuts the envelope open. Billy watches, uncomfortable, as Pi Sit reads the letter inside. After a silence, he nods to Billy that he'll mail it.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHOP AREA - ANOTHER DAY - JOM
N: is working, selling. She wears a tight t-shirt that says, "GUILTY" across the front. Muscular Trustee stands sentry.
C: BILLY
D: without his chains, approaches the shop and Jom smiles, bats her eyelashes.
C: JOM
D: Hi, Billy! Missed you! Long time, I thought you got released...
E: off Billy's look--
C: BILLY
D: I, uh...I need cigarettes. A lot of `em.
C: JOM
D: You need for drugs?
N: Billy looks at Muscular Trustee.
C: JOM
D: Relax. He no speak English.
E: smiles
C: BILLY
D: -- No, it's not for that. Not this time.
N: Billy's hand is on the counter. Jom watches his expression as she reaches through the bars, slowly...and lays her hand on his. The tips of her fingers brush Billy's scarred knuckles, lightly back and forth. He's uncomfortable, and slides his hand back.
C: BILLY
D: I can pay you back. I mean, I will.
N: They look at each other for a moment, then...
C: JOM
D: I believe you.
N: She gives him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES, then discreetly hands him another LOVE NOTE. Billy pockets it.
C: JOM
D: What they for?
E: then, re: the cigarettes
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - RIGHT AFTER - MOVING WITH BILLY
N: through the heat and congested yard. He grips the cigarette carton in one hand, his old gym bag in the other. He pulls Jom's note from his pocket, throws it away without reading it. Then Billy looks, walks with steely determination toward -- E/I. THE PRISON BOXING GYM -- and reaches for the gate. From inside, a BAMBOO STICK comes down hard. Billy yanks his hand back...It's Nan.
C: BILLY
D: You speak English?
C: NAN
D: ...Some.
E: stares; then
N: Billy holds up the carton of cigarettes. Says intensely:
C: BILLY
D: Let me train, and they're yours.
N: BEAT. HOLD. THEN: Nan draws back the gate. Takes the cigarettes. Billy enters. INSIDE THE GYM - MOMENTS AFTER - TWENTY BOXERS work out. It's very loud. Desk Guard in the corner.
C: BILLY
D: stands ringside, and wraps his own hands. Nan lights a cigarette and watches as Billy pulls a small jar of Vaseline from his gym bag and greases up his face, then inserts his old mouthpiece and bites down. Last, he pulls out his old boxing gloves .
E: worn in, blood-stained
N: Billy puts them on, looks to Nan to lace them. As Nan laces Billy's gloves, he sees the SCARS on Billy's arm and looks at him. Billy says nothing. Nan finishes tying the gloves. Billy climbs into the ring, THROUGH the ropes...and waits. Nan looks around the gym at all the BOXERS training. He gestures to one: LEK (20's) -- lean, tattooed, much smaller than Billy -- to get in the ring. Billy, dead staring, watches as Lek steps OVER the ropes and moves to a corner... There's a moment. A LONG one.
C: NAN
D: Chok!
E: fight
N: Billy charges out fast. Lek feels his aggression and starts to circle. Billy attacks and Lek nails him with a front kick to the chest. Billy takes it, then fires a punch. Blocked. A leg kick. Blocked. Lek snaps Billy's head back with a jab. Then again. And again. Then a HUGE KICK to the jaw -- THAT HITS WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK -- Billy goes down in a heap. He shakes it off, clears his head. Other Boxers stop what they're doing and watch as Billy picks himself up, fire in his eyes...and goes after Lek with a vengeance -- Within moments, Lek is throwing and battering Billy like a rag doll. Pounding him at will, with solid PUNCHES and KICKS that knock Billy to the canvas over and over. Billy keeps getting up...But the harder he retaliates, the harder he gets hurt. Nan, ringside, stoically smokes cigarettes, as -- Finally, Lek grabs the back of Billy's head, hauls it down and launches knee after knee after knee into Billy's ribs. Billy goes down hard. He slowly gets up. Balance wavers. Then he turns and VOMITS over the top rope; Humiliated. Nan nods to Lek, who then exits the ring. Billy looks up at all the Boxers talking in Thai, joking and laughing about Billy. He exits the ring...Nan removes the gloves, saying nothing. An assistant trainer, TANE (45) approaches with a MOP and BUCKET on wheels. He points to Billy's puke with disdain. Billy mops the floor. The Boxers resume training. When Billy finishes, he shoves the gate back, and leaves.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PRISON SHOWER AREA - DAY - BILLY
N: his back to us, as he angrily breaks a block of ice in a bucket, stabbing it repeatedly with a bike cog. TIMECUT. Billy sits alone against concrete, holding ice wrapped in a towel against his face. His head is throbbing, ribs and legs hideously bruised and swollen... He takes the ice pack off, revealing bad facial damage: Black eyes, forehead knotted with welts. Dried blood in his nose. He runs a finger inside his mouth, spits blood on the ground. Billy sets the ice-pack on the back of his neck, and hangs his head. A portrait of abject loneliness.
T: CUT ABRUPT TO:
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - MORNING - BILLY
N: sits among Samurai as Bull Guard takes head count. When Billy yells his number: "paet" -- Bull Guard SEES Billy's welts and bruises and calls a halt to the count. Bull Guard shouts something in Thai at Billy. Billy doesn't understand; Bull Guard then shouts at Keng and a few others in Thai ("Who fucked this guy up?! He looks like shit, who did this?!") The Samurai all deny it. Bull Guard storms out. The Samurai glare at Billy...a VERY uncomfortable tension.
S: EXT. TOILET AREA - LATE DAY - BILLY
N: stands in line. Other prisoners chatter in Thai. Billy says nothing. Surrounded, yet alone.
S: INT. SECTOR 5 - NIGHT - BILLY
N: lies awake. Everyone else sleeps. And he thinks, realizes he's not a fighter...but wants to be.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON BOXING GYM - MORNING - NAN
N: is watching the team train. He hears someone outside BANG on the gate and walks over: it's Billy. His bruised face.
C: NAN
D: What you want?
N: Billy presses a new carton of CIGARETTES against the gate.
S: INT. PRISON BOXING GYM - BILLY + NAN
N: walk onto the main floor, passing the Desk Guard. Billy watches the boxers hitting bags, mitts, skipping ropes, sparring, getting massages, etc. They all ignore him; Lek is pounding a heavy bag. He stops and looks at Billy. Lek smiles, nods...Billy nods back. There's a mutual respect in this exchange. Nan sits on the steps of the ring and lights a cigarette.
T: TIMECUTS - BILLY
N: stretches alone...the bruises and welts make it difficult. Billy jumps rope. His legs are sore. Feet get tangled. Billy's slow on the heavy bag. Sweats profusely, breathing hard. Skills/body gone dormant from drugs. Billy does sit-ups hanging off a bench. Grimaces thru a set. No one holds his legs. Billy shadowboxes before a large mirror. He watches the other boxers, and tries to emulate their movements... ...then, Billy sees his own reflection: the face/body of a drug addict. Inward/outward decay. Billy can't look at himself. As Nan finishes his last cigarette, CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON BOXING GYM - LATE DAY - BILLY + NAN
N: sit and talk; The other Boxers are cooling down, packing up gear, talking. Desk Guard waits.
C: NAN
D: You fight before?
E: to Billy
C: BILLY
D: Boxing, six years. As a kid, I won the Northwest area in England.
C: NAN
D: No Muay Thai?
C: BILLY
D: ...Not much.
C: NAN
D: Father train you?
C: BILLY
D: When he used me as a punching bag, I might've learned some.
E: wry
N: BEAT.
C: NAN
D: -- Why you want fight? You in danger?
C: BILLY
D: It helps me forget where I am. When the gloves are on,-- I don't have pain.
E: shakes his head "no"
C: NAN
D: Drugs no do that?
N: BEAT. HOLD. THEN:
C: BILLY
D: I don't want to die.
E: the honest truth
N: Nan stares at him...nods. Then:
C: BILLY
D: How long you got here?
C: NAN
D: One hundred years.
N: PRELAP SOUND A WHISTLE BLOWING, CUT TO:
S: EXT. LANDING/VARIOUS CELLS - LATE DAY - BILLY + PRISONERS
N: are herded back to their cells. Guards lock them in.
S: INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - MORNING - BILLY + NAN
N: train together, using focus pads. Time has passed, the wounds on Billy's face/body look better.
C: NAN
D: Time, work!
N: Billy fires combos -- as Nan catches with the pads -- no pause -- teaching rhythm -- pushing Billy to his limits -- He's clearly exhausted -- so Nan pushes even harder -- LATER: Billy unable to breathe, vomits in a trash can, drugs leaving his system. One of the Boxers hands him a bottle of water. Billy is surprised by the gesture, and drinks.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - NIGHT - CHINESE FIGHTING FISH
N: swim in a whiskey bottle filled with water. WIDEN, REVEAL: All 70 Samurai crowded around, loudly making bets -- holding up cigarettes -- on which fish will win.
C: BILLY
D: is among them, surrounded on all sides by Samurai.
N: Billy gestures/insists to Keng he wants to bet. The Samurai ignore him, a few insult him. Keng shouts at Billy to show him cigarettes.
C: BILLY
D: On my account... My account...
E: off Keng's stare
N: Billy keeps gesturing, pointing to which fish he wants to bet on, bluffing an amount. Finally, Keng nods -- he shouts in Thai at Thin Samurai, who shakes the whiskey bottle up, then sets it down -- The agitated fish begin to circle, then fight...Nipping and thrashing...scales and blood floating... All the Samurai scream/shout, push/shove. Billy is nervous, hoping his fish will win. It does. He exhales. Some Samurai cheer, others are mad. Cigarettes wildly exchange. Billy doesn't get his. He points to the fish he bet on. Samurai refuse to pay. More shoving and shouting. Billy shoves back; One Samurai, in a rage, grabs the whiskey bottle and SMASHES IT against the wall, holds it to Billy's throat. Billy watches the fish flop on the ground and die. Keng, staring at him, signals to the Samurai to pay Billy his cigarettes. They finally do.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - EARLY MORNING - BILLY
N: gets up, dresses quickly. First one to leave, while the Samurai are asleep.
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY
N: runs laps alone around the crowded yard, trying to navigate the madness. The PRISON FOOTBALL TEAM get into a fight during a game. All of them shouting and shoving... Billy runs through it; E/I. PRISON SHOP AREA: COURTYARD - DAY Jom is working behind her cage. Billy walks up...She's happy to see him.
C: JOM
D: Hello, Billy! How my Westerner boyfriend...?
N: He drops a shoebox on her counter: it's filled with all the cigarettes he won. Jom looks at them.
C: BILLY
D: You don't need to send me no more love letters.
N: Jom's smile falls.
C: BILLY
D: I can't be your boyfriend. I just can't...and never will be. Thanks anyway.
N: Jom's eyes well up. Billy walks away...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON BOXING GYM: RING - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY
N: is in line behind three other Boxers in the ring. Across from them, stands a ripped powerful fighter: PON (28). One at a time, each Boxer challenges Pon to grappling combat, until one of them is thrown to the floor. Billy watches as Pon destroys each opponent with astonishing speed and strength. Then, it's Billy's turn. Pon grins and waves him forth. Billy moves in and -- PON + BILLY slam into a clinch. Working hard, Billy takes the brunt of the pain. He pushes Pon, the stronger man, toward the ropes...They grapple aggressively. Then, Pon picks up Billy and tosses him 180 degrees with his power. Billy hits the canvas like a rag doll. Stunned. Pon just laughs...He's extremely dangerous.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAWN - BILLY
N: waits alone with a Trustee in the empty yard. Eyes bleary, Billy just woke up. THE BOXING TEAM jogs past. Billy watches them go...Then, Trustee gestures that Billy's allowed to join; Billy hesitates, then starts to jog...and falls in line... MOVING WITH THEM through different SECTORS of the empty prison. Some shadowbox while running. Billy struggles to keep pace, huffing and puffing. But then he realizes...he's jogging through areas of the prison that he's never seen... Streaks of dawn light the sky. Cool morning air. For Billy, he feels ALIVE...and smiles.
S: INT. PRISON GYM: RING - DAY - BILLY
N: is hitting the pads as Tane holds them. Billy fires fist/shin combos. Hard shots resound. Sweat pours off Billy ...his skill clearly improving. Nan stands at the ropes, giving instructions. THE BUZZER SOUNDS. Billy paces the gym, dripping sweat, hard breathing. He suddenly FREEZES.... OFFICER PI SIT is in the gym. Two GUARDS with him. They stare at Billy. IMMEDIATE TENSION.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Why you here?
N: BILLY
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: I warned you. Made very clear, you must earn this. And how you do that? By defying me--?
C: BILLY
D: I have earned this.
E: low, sincere
N: Officer Pi Sit says something in Thai to the Guards. Then turns to Billy:
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: You will be punished for a month. Whole cell will be punished too.
N: One Guard pulls out shackles. The other, a baton. Billy sighs and exits the ring. The Guards remove his gloves. Nan just watching, then... ...As Officer Pi Sit angrily walks over to the Desk Guard, talks firm, Nan walks over and talks to Pi Sit in private. The Guards roughly cut off Billy's handwraps as he watches Nan and Officer Pi Sit talk in the distance. WE/BILLY CANNOT HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING OVER THE ROAR OF BOXERS HITTING BAGS, MITTS, PADS, ETC. Billy just watching, several tense moments... ...then Officer Pi Sit walks back to Billy. A BEAT, THEN:
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: I give you one chance: You will fight at Songkran.
E: firm, still angry
N: Billy lets out a deep breath, nods.
C: BILLY
D: thanks.
N: As Officer and Pi Sit and Guards start to leave --
C: BILLY
D: Who am I fightin'?
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Could be yourself.
E: keeps walking
N: Nan joins Billy.
C: NAN
D: You know what is Songkran?
C: BILLY
D: No.
C: NAN
D: Thai New Year. In three weeks: all prison celebrates...Boxers fight to qualify for National tournament.
N: Off Billy's look --
S: INT. PRISON BOXING GYM - WEEKS LATER - PON
N: is on a scale. All the Boxers are checking their weights for Songkran. The gym is crowded with Guards and Officer Pi Sit, who supervises. Outside the gym gate: DOZENS OF PRISONERS have gathered to watch, deciding who they'll bet on. Among them, are the SAMURAI. Pon makes weight: 175 Next, Billy steps on. Pi Sit leans in to read Billy's weight: 210 lbs. (about 35 lbs overweight)
C: BILLY
D: The fuck? Is the scale broke?
N: Billy looks down: Someone else's foot is on the scale: Pon. He grins, malevolent. Billy heels Pon's leg off. Officer Pi Sit watches without expression. On the verge of erupting...Billy gets off the scale, Nan resets, and Billy gets back on. Pon inches up behind...blows in Billy's ear, then whispers something we can't hear. Billy makes weight: 175 Then, he reels and throws a punch that doesn't land, because they're separated. Shouting. Pushing. The entire team now,
T: the Guards-- CUT OUT;
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - PRISONERS
N: celebrate. The yard is alive with festivities. Carnivalesque. ON STAGE, with A LADY-BOY BAND, Black Dildo wears a long wig, performs a romantic Thai song. Prisoners and Guards are mixing, eating, dancing to music, throwing water in all directions and laughing. Everyone in high spirits... OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF THE GYM, Billy and the boxing team emerge, carrying the RING out to the sunlit yard, where they set it down. THE SOUND OF A CELEBRATION FILLS THE AIR.... Billy stand with Lek, watching, in disbelief. Then, a prisoner runs by and hurls A BUCKET OF WATER on Billy. He's soaked, freezing. Lek starts laughing, as--
C: ANGLE, THE BUDDHA STATUE
D: Two Prisoners on stools pour flowered water over it, as others pray, light incense and candles.
N: A LINE OF BUDDHIST MONKS young and old, in bright orange robes, move through the yard, as the far as the eye can see. Billy SEES Prisoners and Guards flock to the Monks, kneeling, making offerings of fruit and ornaments. In return, the Monks give blessings, sprinkling sacred water with a stick on the prisoners' hands and faces...
C: ANGLE, A YOUNG MONK
D: that summons Billy forth.
N: Billy hesitates, then steps closer. The Young Monk smiles and applies the sprinkles Billy's face. He doesn't know what it means. Doesn't need to. It feels peaceful. AND AS MUSIC CARRIES OVER...for the first time, Billy smiles. WIDEN. THE WHOLE YARD IS CELEBRATING. Only the ring is empty. Then, Black Dildo voice booms over the microphone:
C: BLACK DILDO
D: Lady-boys and gentlemen, iiiiittt's FIGHT TIME!!
N: SMASH TO:
S: EXT. RING - DAY - LEK
N: is fighting THAI BOXER #2. They trade shots. Then, a HUGE PUNCH from Lek CRASHES HARD into Thai Boxer #2's head -- AND HE FALLS FACE DOWN ON THE CANVAS, EYES WIDE, KNOCKED OUT. THE CROWD GOES CRAZY. Billy stands outside the ring, gloves on, just inches from the ko'd boxer's face. We SEE the FEAR on Billy's face. As the REFEREE (a Guard) tries to revive him, he sharply signals to Billy that he fights next. Lek exits the ring, pats Billy's shoulder and smiles, encouraging him. Billy swallows, then climbs the steps to the ring, and we --
T: TIMECUT/SMASH TO:
S: EXT. RING - BETWEEN ROUNDS, PON'S CORNER - PON
N: sits as Tane and another CORNERMAN shout advice fast/loud in Thai, over the noise of the crowd. As-- BILLY'S CORNER - A WHITE TOWEL fills the frame. It's soaked with BLOOD. Go behind it as Nan is working Billy's corner. He's breathing hard, his EAR IS SPLIT OPEN down the middle. It's grotesque.
C: BILLY
D: How bad is it? Is it bad?
C: NAN
D: Not good.
C: BILLY
D: His elbow done it, the cunt.
C: NAN
D: Next round not for you. Your ear almost come off.
C: BILLY
D: Fuck that. I got another one.
N: Billy looks to the crowd: Everyone from Songkran going crazy, gambling. Keng and Samurai betting big on Pon. In the front row: is Officer Pi Sit, arms folded, watching stoically. JOM, in a short skirt and high heels, walks the ring w/a CARD FOR ROUND 4. The crowd WHISTLES/CHEERS. Jom winks at Billy, who looks away, annoyed. AND THE BELL.
S: INT. THE RING - ROUND 4 - BILLY + PON
N: rush in. Trade heavy shots. FISTS, KNEES and SHINS... Their bodies absorbing the shock. Pon GRINDS HIS GLOVE into Billy's ear. Blood and white cells pour. It's hard to watch. Billy reacts and fires a three-punch flurry that lands, then Pon steps over and hammers a hook to Billy's exposed kidney. Billy drops to one knee, air leaves him, pain engulfing him. As the REFEREE (a Guard) counts, Billy looks to the crowd: SEES Officer Pi Sit watching him, SEES gambling prisoners going nuts. Samurai sensing victory. Then, he SEES Nan who signals Billy to rise.... ....and he does. A split-second, and Pon charges. Billy blocks A RAGE OF PON'S HEAD SHOTS and KNEES, doing his best to cover. A FIST SLAMS through Billy's guard, like a shotgun. Billy comes off the rope and hits Pon with a vicious three- shot combo, right-left-right. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM. Feints. Then a solid OVERHAND RIGHT that BREAKS the bridge of Pon's nose. THE BELL. The Ref pulls them apart. Billy throws Pon a crazed look of defiance -- The crowd ROARS for Billy, as he goes to his corner and sits;
S: INT. BILLY'S CORNER
N: Nan works Billy's arms and legs;
C: BILLY
D: How's the ear?
C: NAN
D: Still there.
N: Jom walks the ring with a CARD FOR ROUND 5. This time, she blows Billy a kiss...taunting him. Billy gets even madder...Nan slaps him hard across the face.
C: NAN
D: Last round, Billy! Must knock out or lose fight!
E: shouting
N: IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER: Pon stares at Billy with disdain. Ready to finish him off; THE BELL. ROUND FIVE: A PON BARRAGE slams us right into mid-round five. Billy covers. Pon -- insulting, taunting -- grapples with Billy, cursing through his mouthpiece... Pon launches a short right that Billy counters with a BIG LEFT HOOK that connects. Pon's head snaps, sweat sprays. And Billy goes for the kill. A HARD RIGHT CROSS SLAMS HOME on Pon's face -- knocking him to the canvas with a HEAVY THUD, out cold. No need to count. The Ref waves it over, removes Pon's mouthpiece: it's a bloody mess. The Crowd erupts. The Samurai, staring, simmering. Officer Pi Sit, in disbelief. Pon lays unconscious, as Cornermen try to revive him. As Billy, drapes his arms over the corner, and breathes...he looks up, sees Jom being escorted out by Trustees. A beat of regret;
S: EXT. RINGSIDE - LATER, LATE DAY - BILLY
N: lies on a bench as a THAI CUTMAN stitches up Billy's ear. KENG + 70 SAMURAI stand nearby...all shouting/cursing/spitting/vehement in Thai, angry at having lost their bets. FOUR GUARDS stand post, keeping them back, as -- Two THAI BOXERS fight in the ring, the tournament hasn't stopped. The crowd going wild. We can see the pain in Billy's face.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHOWER AREA: PRISON COURTYARD - DUSK - THE BOXING TEAM
N: celebrate. The courtyard empty, but them and two Guards. Billy (his ear now bandaged) with Lek and the team, bathing their WOUNDS, their CUTS, their SWOLLEN LIMBS from their own fights at Songkran. They laugh and throw water, for the moment, as if children. Nan is with them, smoking, smiles.
S: INT. PI SIT'S OFFICE: COMMAND CENTRE - NEXT DAY - BILLY
N: his ear bandaged, enters with a GUARD. Pi Sit waits at his desk. Billy sits on the floor, placing his hands together, as a mark of respect. After a moment:
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Your fight at Songkran was impressive. Insane, but impressive.
N: BILLY
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: I'm going to transfer you to the boxing team's cell... You will share in their privileges: better food, earlier to shower to avoid line, same thing at night.
E: off Billy's look
N: Billy nods, tight smile.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: But if you lose in National tournament, you will be sent back to live with regular prisoners.
N: Billy's smile drops.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: You are first Farang to compete. Consider this an honor. But for us to win, every - fight - count. Have two months to train...and you'll need it.
N: Billy's silent. Reality of the pain ahead floods in.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Tournament will take place in maximum security prison. The men you will face have life and death sentence. They no just try win, they try kill.
N: Billy reacts. The weight of these stakes hadn't occurred to him.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: If you no want face this, and can't represent this prison...say now.
N: PAUSE.....
C: BILLY
D: I won't let you down.
N: Officer Pi Sit signals to the Guard, who then lifts Billy to his feet. As he starts to leave...
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Wait.
N: Billy turns to see Officer Pi Sit pick up an envelope from his desk and holds it out to Billy. It's already been opened and read.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: From your Mother.
N: ON BILLY. HOLD.
T: CUT TO:
N: I/E. SECTOR 5 CELL - DAYS LATER - KENG + 70 SAMURAI sit in silence, angry, simmering, as TWO GUARDS stand by the door, waiting --
C: BILLY
D: collects his belongings. He's being transferred out of the Samurai cell.
N: As Billy heads for the door, he looks back at Keng, who gestures a knife cutting Billy's throat. Billy walks out.
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - FOLLOW BILLY
N: and Guards as they escort him across the yard...into a separate, WOOD BUILDING and move down a long, dark hall in silence. Billy is led into a LARGE CELL and first sees the FOOTBALL TEAM, standing looking at him... ...Then, suddenly, Billy discovers Nan, Lek and the ENTIRE BOXING TEAM waiting for him in this SPORT TEAMS' CELL ("Hong Nak Geela"). All the boxers cheer and whistle, call him "Crazy Farang." All except Pon. Billy, bewildered by it all, dives into the team. All of them laughing and wrestling.
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - BILLY
N: is awake, as everyone else sleeps. Billy reads the letter from his Mum quietly to himself; Deep emotion fills Billy's face. He wipes his eyes. SMASH TO: E/I. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - PRE DAWN - GUARDS loudly drag their batons along the bars of the team cell, waking Billy, Nan and the Boxers. A Guard gives them a head count.
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAWN - WIDE:
N: The yard is very still, very quiet. As the sun dips low, the boxing team, in silhouette, jogs laps around the courtyard. Billy runs among the them...He sees a rapist Samurai, naked, hands tied behind his back, being forced to roll in the yard, while getting kicked and humiliated by Guards. Billy looks up at the Sector 5 Cell, sees the rest of the Samurai behind bars, watching. Billy keeps jogging... ALL WE HEAR IS BREATHING...IN/OUT/IN/OUT/IN/OUT/IN/OUT/AND
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - BILLY
N: lies on his stomach in the dark, amidst a circle of Boxers, conducting a sacred Sak Yant tattoo ritual. It's EXTREMELY HOT, EXTREMELY INTENSE. Lek and two Boxers hold Billy down, as another: TIGER uses a 40cm long needle (the "Mai Sak") to apply the ink onto Billy's back with fast, repeated jabs....the image of a LEAPING TIGER beginning... Billy fights the pain, holding it in; The boxers invoke a deep, hypnotic mantra (the "Kata"), some clutching amulet fragments, the chanting becomes ONE VOICE... CU's. Billy's pores, needle scraping ink made of snake venom, and jabbing. Lek wipes blood off Billy's back, revealing the Leaping Tiger and SAK YANT tattoos forming. Billy's eyes roll back, the mantra inducing a trance state. As Nan blows into the tattoo, the Boxers become shadows, silhouettes...The cell walls fading. All we see is Billy. All we hear is chanting...
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY
N: walks alone, thinking. Time has passed. His bandage is gone. Billy watches the swirl of activity from a distance. Prisoners eating in the outdoor kitchen. And Jom, in her shop, selling wares...engaging with prisoners. Billy stares for a moment...then keeps walking.
S: EXT. PRISON GYM: CANTEEN - DAY - BILLY, NAN + BOXING TEAM
N: are crowded around a long table. Plates/bowls of fish, ant eggs, crab somtam, chicken, pork, chiang-mai noodles are passed around as Billy and the boxing team eat. AD LIB talking/joking/banter.
C: THAI BOXER
D: Hey Crazy farang, why you in prison?
C: BILLY
D: ...Drugs...
C: THAI BOXER
D: What kind?
C: BILLY
D: All of `em.
N: The Team laughs. Billy can't help but smile.
C: BILLY
D: How `bout you?
C: THAI BOXER
D: No, I no do drugs...I just kill.
N: Thai Boxer pounds his own chest, as if stimulating a knife stabbing. The Team LAUGHS harder....so Billy laughs too.
S: INT. PRISON BOXING GYM: RING - DAY - BILLY + LEK
N: in protective gear, spar and grapple. Flesh on flesh impact. Nan stands at the ropes, instructing. Billy gets thrown down. Nan yells at him to get up. Billy jumps up and re-engages. Lek throws him down again. Billy pounds the canvas with his fist, in frustration. Nan signals Billy to exit the ring. Two more Boxers climb in.
S: INT. SPORTS TEAM CELL - EVENING - BILLY, NAN + BOXING TEAM
N: are given head count by a Guard at night.
S: INT. SPORTS TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - BILLY + LEK
N: sit together, looking at a PHOTO ALBUM of Lek's family. Lek points to things in the photos, then teaches Billy how to say them in Thai: ..."my house"..." "...my son..." "...my temple..." "...my father..." Billy repeats each in Thai. Then:
C: LEK
D: Do you have father?
N: Billy pauses, then nods "yes."
C: LEK
D: He come visit you?
C: BILLY
D: ...no...we don't talk anymore.
S: INT. PRISON BOXING GYM - MORNING - BILLY
N: shadowboxes before the large mirror. He looks strong, fast. Now, comfortable facing his reflection.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOCKER AREA - DAY - BILLY
N: leaving the gym, walks out to his locker. He opens it, shoves his gym bag inside, shuts it. Then, Billy turns to see someone standing there. It's Kiaw. Cold stare at Billy.
C: BILLY
D: Kiaw...When'd they let you out?
C: KIAW
D: When I heal.
N: Billy sees new scars on Kiaw's face. They're unnerving.
C: BILLY
D: I haven't got time for this.
C: KIAW
D: Your hair look good...
C: BILLY
D: --What?
C: KIAW
D: You take my shampoo bottle-- smoke all heroin inside it.
N: Billy's silent. Then:
C: BILLY
D: So? You was gonna throw me to the guards...Now we're even.
C: KIAW
D: That heroin belong to Samurai. Cost much money!
C: BILLY
D: That's your problem...
N: Kiaw persists, getting angry:
C: KIAW
D: You pay now.
C: BILLY
D: I don't owe you nothin'.
E: in disbelief--
N: SOMEONE WHISTLES from above...A GUARD on the balcony. He sharply gestures to Billy and Kiaw to move on. Billy walks away. Kiaw steps in his path:
C: KIAW
D: You know I have AIDS. You pay my debt to Samurai or I inject you with my blood.
N: Kiaw holds Billy's stare: it's murderous. Then, he leaves.
S: INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - AFTERNOON - BILLY
N: and a few other BOXERS sit on a bench, having their training injuries treated by DOCTORS: cut knuckles, cut lips and eyebrows, hyper-extended knees, black-eyes. Billy, still angry, is having his bruised ribs taped. A GERMAN INMATE in his 60's -- pale, fat, sweaty -- sits on another bench, waiting, eating a plate of food. Near the medical hatch, Jom is talking to a MUSCULAR TRUSTEE, fanning herself with a Chinese fan and flirting. She notices Billy-- glancing over, then ignores him and struts toward the other Boxers, as if an audience:
C: JOM
D: ...You good fighters, not bad. My father want me to be Muay Thai, like him.
N: The Boxers all look at her, in disbelief. Jom smiles;
C: JOM
D: But his dream not mine. I start taking hormones when I was fifteen. Father say I bring great shame, and he disown me. But now I am who I want to be. Happy with myself.
E: she looks deliberately at Billy--
N: Billy, simmering, as Jom turns back to Muscular Trustee and smiles;
C: JOM
D: My only regret is I should have had kids before I cut my dick off.
N: Muscular Trustee smiles back. Billy hides his jealousy, but can't keep from watching Jom deliberately feign affection for Muscular Trustee.
C: GERMAN INMATE
D: Well me, I like to fuck `em younger. Much younger...Dick or no dick, it don't matter.
N: The German grins. Jom looks at him, uncomfortable. For Billy, the tension rises to a boiling point.
C: GERMAN INMATE
D: How many cigarettes to suck me off?
E: to Jom
C: JOM
D: You, Westerner-- what your problem?!
C: GERMAN INMATE
D: -- I haven't got a problem, I've got cigarettes. Are you going to blow me or not--?!
N: THE SIREN BEGINS TO WAIL: time to go back to the cells. They keep arguing; back and forth. Jom becomes livid, shouting in Thai and -- Billy reacts -- He charges across and yanks the German Inmate up by the neck -- grabs the FORK from his plate -- German Inmate SCREAMS, terrified -- as an enraged Billy puts the fork to his throat.
C: BILLY
D: -- Shut your mouth, or I'll bash your fuckin' skull in, nob head!
N: Jom is frozen. Surprised. But also flattered.
C: GERMAN INMATE
D: Fuck off, faggot!
E: pulls away; then to Billy--
N: A crazed Billy overpowers the German Inmate -- fiercely, intensely -- pushing the fork toward the German's EYE -- He can't hold Billy off --
C: BILLY
D: Open your eyes...
N: He doesn't.
C: BILLY
D: I SAID, OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES!!!
N: He does, then shuts them immediately. The fork's within centimeters -- about to force in --
C: JOM
D: BILLY, NO! CALM DOWN! LET HIM GO!
E: shouts
N: Billy reacts; Now, Muscular Trustee shoves Billy off -- as the Boxers forcibly restrain Billy from killing the German Inmate. Jom moves away, well protected by Muscular Trustee. THE SIREN KEEPS WAILING;
C: JOM
D: You scare me, farang...very crazy! Can no control yourself!
E: shouting
C: BILLY
D: -- You, you're just a whore!
N: Jom's eyes go wide with shock. Anger.
C: JOM
D: -- You make everything bad! You fucking junkie! Will never change! You think too much! Mi dong kit mak!
E: then You think too much!
N: Billy, held by Boxers, looks at her -- His rage replaced by shame.
C: JOM
D: I no want see you, farang ba! Don't ever come around me!
E: crazy foreigner
N: Jom leaves down a hall w/Muscular Trustee, who comforts her. Billy is led toward the exit by the Boxers, but he keeps staring after Jom. He feels rejected. THE SIREN STILL WAILING, AS --
S: INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - DAY - BILLY
N: unleashing a hailstorm of violent Thai kicks, pounding the bag -- harder and harder, yelling out with each attack.
S: INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - LATER - LEK + ANOTHER BOXER
N: are in the ring, demonstrating the Ram Muay ritual dance. They each wear a "mongkhon" (headband) and "pra jiad" (armbands). Wai Khru music plays on an old radio. Billy and Nan, also in the ring, stand near the ropes.
C: NAN
D: Ram Muay...before each fight, we pledge respect to spirits.
N: Nan points/bows/prays AROUND the ring: the ropes, the canvas, the gloves, the fighters themselves...
C: NAN
D: --Bless...spirit...bless...spirit, bless...
N: Billy watches Lek and the boxer gracefully move through a series of rhythmic gestures and postures. Billy is deep in a stew of his own confusion, trying to hide his state of mind from the others.
C: NAN
D: Now you.
E: re: the Ram Muay
C: BILLY
D: I'm no dancer.
C: NAN
D: Can no compete tournament without.
N: Billy doesn't move. Nan shoots him an angry look.
C: NAN
D: Muay Thai more than just "fight." Disrespect spirits or no believe, you never understand Muay Thai!
C: BILLY
D: I "believe."
C: NAN
D: No--! When you at peace, can control anything, and win. Anger: lose everything.
E: off Billy's look
N: ON BILLY.
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - EVENING - BILLY
N: among the entire Boxing Team, and Football Team, as they kneel for Buddhist Evening Prayer ("Suad Mon Yen"). Chanting fills the cell, and Billy watches them, isolated and apart. His thoughts elsewhere. SMASH TO:
S: INT. RING: PRISON GYM - DAY - BILLY
N: is nailed with a punch in this sparring session. A combo of THREE MORE HARD SHOTS from Lek hit Billy clean, and he bounces off the ropes. Lek looks over at Nan, who is standing on the ring apron, watching: Billy is NOT throwing back.
C: NAN
D: Hands up!
N: Billy takes a kick to the chest. Then another. Lek gives an imploring look, then fires a series of PUNCHES; Billy just takes it, refusing to cover. Lek knees his ribs, and Billy slumps forward into a clinch. Lek shoves Billy off, paws with a jab...concerned. Suddenly, Billy dips and CRASHES A HOOK ON LEK'S JAW -- stunning him. As Lek staggers, Billy unleashes FOUR DEVASTATING PUNCHES AND LEK IS BADLY HURT.
C: NAN
D: Billy! Hya Suk!
E: that's enough!
N: Other Boxers stop training now, looking over, as-- BILLY KEEPS ATTACKING -- A BARRAGE OF HOOKS, BOTH LEFTS AND RIGHTS -- LEK IS OUT ON HIS FEET. DESK GUARD, ALARMED, SHOUTS SOMETHING IN THAI; NAN JUMPS IN THE RING, GOES TO JUMP IN-BETWEEN AS -- BILLY LANDS A HUGE UPPERCUT AND LEK FALLS, HIS NECK BOUNCING OFF THE BOTTOM ROPE, WHERE HE LAYS, UNCONSCIOUS. SILENCE falls over the gym. Billy is shocked at what he's done. So is Nan, as he quickly goes to Lek's aid. Billy storms out of the ring, rips off his gloves with his teeth, then slams them in a trash bin and leaves... Desk Guard hurries after him. The rest of the Boxers, confused, watch Billy go.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PUNISHMENT CELL - NEXT DAY - BILLY
N: is walked in by Desk Guard, holding his belongings. He's been transferred to another cell: 12 square feet. Only five Thai inmates inside. As the Desk Guard shuts the bars, Billy hears someone giggle. He turns to see Noi -- the mentally retarded inmate from earlier. No one else says a word.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PUNISHMENT CELL - DAYS/NIGHTS - BILLY
N: condemned in here for a week. No talking. Very little light. In the days/nights that follow.... Billy pounds the wall with his fist. Slow, heavy thuds, that come one after another. Billy pumps out sit-ups. Billy does furious push-ups. Noi watches Billy, giggling. Billy stops and looks at him. Billy does push-ups with Noi on his back. Guards enter, drop off food, then lock the bars again. Billy and Noi sit/eat together. Noi smiles. Billy smiles back. Prisoners' clothes hang on a wire. Billy rips it down and uses it as a jump rope. As he does, Billy's eyes glaze over, somewhere else. Billy/Cellmates sleep, inches apart. Noi right next to Billy. Guards enter again. Drop off food. Shut the bars. In back of the cell/shower, Billy helps Noi bathe. Then dries him off with a towel. Later, Billy stands with a DULL RAZOR and starts to shave his own head. Intense expression on his face; All the prisoners watch in ominous silence. A few drops of blood stream down the back of Billy's scalp and neck. His head now shaved, he now shaves off his eyebrows...leaving the skin underneath beaded in blood. Guards bring in food; shut the bars. Billy starts shadowboxing. FIRING COMBOS that get faster and harder -- More and more violent... The other prisoners move back, nervous, afraid -- Except Noi. Billy keeps punching, pivoting, attacking...dripping with sweat. The combos coming with blazing force and speed -- Billy finally stops, drops to his knees. Noi applauds, his eyebrows shaved as well. Noi gives Billy water, smiles. And for the first time, Billy SPEAKS in THAI:
C: BILLY
D: Pom chuu Billy khrap? Khoun chuu aray? .
E: My name is Billy What's your name
N: Noi giggles.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PRISON - DAWN - WIDE:
N: It's still and quiet. Everyone in their cells, asleep.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - EARLY MORNING - NAN + BOXING TEAM
N: are sitting in their cell, quietly. Lek, among them, still with bruises. There's a sound of the door opening and a figure walks in: It's Billy...released from punishment. Brought in by Desk Guard. Everyone stares. Billy tries to gather courage as he walks up to Nan. There's a long moment before he speaks:
C: BILLY
D: I fucked up. I know it, Nan. Honest.
N: Nan says nothing...
C: BILLY
D: I just lost it, is all. I lost me self,-- everything you taught me. If I could, I'd rip me own heart out and show it to you... I didn't come this far to quit.
E: beat beat, then
N: Nan stares. Silent. Billy tries not to break down. Then, Nan hands Billy a pair of BOXING SHORTS. Billy looks down, sees the name written on them: "CRAZY FARANG"
C: NAN
D: Tournament very soon. Must train twice as hard now. Don't disappoint me.
N: Billy nods, quietly comes alive.
C: BILLY
D: I forgot cigarettes.
E: realizes
C: NAN
D: I no more smoke. Bad for health.
N: Billy's back on the team. He walks to Lek and sits down next to him. There's a moment...Then, Lek holds out a fist...Billy bumps it, both smile.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON GYM - DAY - BILLY
N: holds a rope between his teeth, that's tied to a weight. He lifts it up and down, strengthening his neck.
S: EXT. COURTYARD: SHOP AREA - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY
N: walks in the strangely almost empty courtyard. Like an uncomfortable dream. Suddenly he SEES in the distance... NOI sitting alone, on the ground. He's sad, dejected, for once not smiling. Billy walks over. Noi sees Billy and his mood changes immediately. He runs to him with his moldy FLIP-FLOPS split down the middle;
C: NOI
D: BILLY!!!
N: Noi hugs Billy tight.
C: BILLY
D: You need new shoes...
N: Noi doesn't respond. Billy speaks in Thai:
C: BILLY
D: Rong tow, see lao.
E: Your shoes are not good
N: Noi looks up, grunts.
C: NOI
D: Roo lao!
E: I know!
C: BILLY
D: Pom Ja sue longtow mai hai khun na.
E: I'll buy you new ones.
N: Noi, a huge smile...He removes his flip-flops, gives them kiss, then HURLS them over the prison wall. He then marches quickly away, singing a Thai song loudly and out of tune.
S: EXT. SHOP AREA - LATER - BILLY + NOI
N: are at a stand, rummaging through items for sale. The shop owner is a VERY OLD THAI PRISONER. Billy inspects items: coffee, shaving cream, soup cans...They agree on the flip=flops that Noi likes. As Noi tries them on, Billy then moves to a row of feminine items: lipstick, eye shadow, a woman's headband with a plastic flower attached. He looks up at the Old Man watching him. Billy picks up the flower headband;
C: BILLY
D: ...it's not for me...
E: to the Old Man
N: The Old Man SMILES. Noi looks at Billy, concerned. Hopes it's not for him. Shakes his head, "no." Billy is amused. Both laugh.
S: INT. ANTECHAMBER - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY
N: is alone in the empty chamber, practicing the Ram Muay dance. The music plays on a bad radio...His movements are stiff, uncomfortable. He's clearly frustrated. There's a sound. Billy turns;
C: REVEAL: JOM
D: is standing outside the chamber. She wears the hair band with the plastic flower. Two TRUSTEES stand sentry as Jom enters the chamber and walks to Billy.
N: Billy stares at her in silence. Emotion roiling through him. They look at each for a long, unspoken moment. Then Jom steps back and begins to perform the Ram Muay dance. Billy watches, transfixed as she teaches. It's strange and spiritual. Her movements graceful, yet surprisingly powerful. Now, Billy tries, following Jom's lead. Back and forth...She guides him along, together...both moving like water. Both smile. Forgiving.
S: INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - EVENING (TWO WEEKS LATER -
N: BILLY + PON are sparring. The gym is otherwise empty except for Nan, Tane and the Desk Guard. (Billy's eyebrows are mostly grown back.) BILLY + PON engage, grapple, then fight out. It's intense, but more for technique, ironing out Billy's flaws. Mid-round, Pon CRASHES a shin into Billy's kidney. Billy takes it. Covers and assaults, aggressively going after Pon. THE BUZZER ends the round...Billy and Pon bump gloves. IN THE CORNER: Nan gives Billy water, then notices that Billy is sweating profusely.
C: NAN
D: Faster! Let hands and feet go!
N: Billy takes a labored breath, nods. THE BUZZER Billy circles, on the defensive. Pon cuts down the ring and tries to nail him, but Billy avoids and clinches. He's having trouble breathing... Pon wrestles Billy to the ropes. Billy hacks and splutters... a few FLECKS OF BLOOD spray onto Pon's shoulder. Only Billy notices... Something is wrong; They break apart and Billy fends off more blows from Pon. THE BUZZER ENDS THE ROUND.
S: INT. PRISON GYM: BATHROOM - RIGHT AFTER - BILLY
N: walks in and shuts the door. Locks it. He stands there a moment, afraid. When suddenly and without warning -- a knife-like pain shoots through Billy's side -- his chest begins heaving -- AND HE VOMITS BLOOD VIOLENTLY.
S: EXT. PRISON GYM + COURTYARD - MINUTES LATER - BILLY
N: with Nan, Pon, Tane follow Desk Guard back toward their cell. WE SEE the concern on Billy's face. He tries to hide it from Nan...
C: NAN
D: You okay?
C: BILLY
D: ...yeah...
E: he isn't
C: NAN
D: Fear is good for fight. Like fire, inside you.
N: Billy's silent, struggling to hide his pain from Nan.
C: NAN
D: It's almost time.
N: Billy considers telling Nan about his pain: He doesn't. BLACK.
S: INT. PRISON INFIRMARY: SMALL OFFICE - AFTERNOON - BILLY
N: waits, alone. In the hallway, two other Westerner inmates wait on a bench.
C: A MAN'S VOICE
D: Mr. Moore?
E: O.C.
N: Billy looks up: DR. ADI (40, British) has entered, holding a clipboard.
C: DR. ADI
D: Mr. Moore, I am Dr. Adi.
C: BILLY
D: Never seen you here before...
C: DR. ADI
D: I come once a month to give medical aid to foreigners.
N: BEAT.

D: I'm not sure.
C: DR. ADI
D: You have a delineation of the esophagus.
C: BILLY
D: A what...?
C: DR. ADI
D: It's a tear. Primary cause: drug and alcohol abuse. Through years of this, it's worn away the lining of your esophagus.
N: BEAT.
C: BILLY

C: DR. ADI
D: You need to stay that way.
C: BILLY

C: DR. ADI
D: Make other plans.
C: BILLY
D: Doc, I'm in prison. I haven't got no "other plans."
N: BEAT.
C: DR. ADI
D: Boxing is what caused the rupture. You vomited blood because you had at least a pint in there. Any more trauma, and you could hemorrhage. You'll bleed to death.
N: Billy looks at him. Dr. Adi starts to write on his clipboard.
C: DR. ADI
D: I'm putting in a request to have you transferred to a government hospital. They'll patch your esophagus, or perhaps cauterize it.
C: BILLY
D: I'll just, I'll keep my guard up.
C: DR. ADI
D: Mr. Moore --
C: BILLY
D: -- I'll watch my pace.
C: DR. ADI
D: Mr. Moore. You must never fight again.
N: ON BILLY. HOLD.
S: EXT. PRISON INFIRMARY - AFTERNOON - BILLY
N: steps out of the infirmary into the heat. He stands there, alone, looking around...a lost animal.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - DAY, LATER - NAN
N: stands at ring center, in full protective gear w/large pads -- one by one, five boxers take their turn unleashing rapid-fire Thai kicks (20 at a time), shouting with each shot. It's fast. It's loud. It's relentless.
C: BILLY
D: is the last to go. Hoping to prove the doctor wrong. He attacks the bag. fast. loud. violent.
N: REVEAL: NOI is in the gym now, sitting on the ring steps. He LAUGHS and APPLAUDS Billy. (He also wears new flip-flops.) Nan points to a BROOM nearby.
C: NAN
D: Nong Chai, Kub pai tum ngan khun na krub.
E: Little brother, go back to work.
N: Noi quickly gets up, starts to sweep the gym. He's the new team assistant. Billy looks at Nan, nods "thanks." And Billy walks away. Light-headed, he clutches his chest, hiding the pain.
C: BILLY
D: ...fuck...
E: low, to himself
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SHOWER AREA (TROUGH) - DAY - BILLY
N: under the water. It flows down his neck and tattooed back. Cup after cup. He breathes in the cold...breathing in that place where fighters go...where emotion is stilled and eyes focus, concentrating. Then --
C: BILLY'S FACE
D: plunges into water, FULL FRAME. Bubbles spiral, eyes peel open. Then, he whips his head back...
N: ...out of a trough, as he stands in THE COURTYARD. He wipes water from his face. Then, sensing something in the distance, he instinctively turns... To his left: two Samurai. To his right: Kiaw and one more. Then Keng. All of them, staring. Billy freezes, staring back. Now, something in the Samurai's eyes goes dead and realization hits him... Utter fucking TERROR Billy RUNS -- heart hammering, thru prisoner traffic as the Samurai give chase. Suddenly, KIAW catches Billy from behind, both go sprawling -- Billy, on his feet fast, STOMPS KIAW HARD -- then sprints away, as the other Samurai close in... THE LAUNDRY AREA - BILLY -- bursts in, frenetic thru a maze of sheets. He gets tangled, screams, falls. AND ALL FIVE SAMURAI POUNCE, fists and feet...pounding Billy, trapped in the sheet, as-- KENG rips the sheet back. Faces inches apart. He shouts to Kiaw in Thai, who pulls out a SYRINGE and plunges it into his own veins...drawing out INFECTED BLOOD. Kiaw hands Keng the syringe, as the others hold Billy's neck.
C: BILLY
D: NO! NO!
C: KENG
D: You have tournament come up, yes?
E: to Billy
N: Billy frozen, wide-eyed, nods.
C: KENG
D: Win fight and pay us your earnings. You lose, it end bad for you...
N: TENSE PAUSE. FUCKING ALL HELL TERRIFYING. Billy nods. The Samurai drops Billy in the dirt, then walk away.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY
N: back in the cell with the entire Boxing Team and Football Team, as they kneel for Buddhist pre-dawn sutras. Chanting fills the cell. Billy shows Noi how to pray; They all pray together.
T: INTERCUT: OTHER CELLS/AREAS + PRISONERS
N: also praying. Lady Boys, Samurai, et al. In the COURTYARD, Muslims pray ("Salat al-Maghhrib"). All of it, hypnotic, tonal overlapping floods the air... The prayer before dawn. BLACK/HOLD IN BLACK/THEN:
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY, NAN, LEK, TIGER + A FEW
N: OTHER BOXERS march in chains and shackles; gym bags in hand, some with boxing gloves tied around their necks. Guards watch the line. The yard is otherwise empty. All the prisoners, locked in their cells, watch the team pass. Billy sees: Jom in the Control Section. She smiles, waves through the fence. Billy nods, gratitude behind it. Then he glances at the Isolation Cell as he passes. They team is marched through a series of MASSIVE GATES and BARRED DOORS, onto the MAIN GATES...where a pair of GUARDS pull them open, showing us the outside....
S: EXT. PRISON: MAIN GATES - BILLY, NAN, LEK, TIGER + BOXERS
N: step outside the prison gates. Billy pauses for a moment... taking in the open air. There's a few houses around, offices and empty lots. The slightest smile comes to his face. ANGLE, A WAITING PRISON BUS It's packed to the rafters with prisoners. Faces peer through steel-mesh. Billy follows the team into the bus...
S: INT. PRISON BUS - BILLY
N: gets on. Prisoners crammed like cattle, everyone in chains. Billy squeezes through and sits next to Nan.
C: BILLY
D: They all here for the fight?
C: NAN
D: Only boxers go to tournament.
N: Billy looks to the back of the bus: a group of prisoners are caged in a smaller compartment, facing a Guard w/a shotgun.
C: BILLY
D: So where they headed?
C: NAN
D: Some get transfer. Others go to death house.
N: E/I. PRISON BUS (MOVING) - DAY/LATE DAY - VARIOUS shots of the prison bus, traveling through Thailand.
C: BILLY
D: watches scenery pass. People on the streets; temples; markets; life on the outside.
N: As the bus moves through lush Evergreen forests...Billy leans against the mesh window, wind hitting his face. He breathes in clean air.
S: 166 INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RECEPTION - BILLY, NAN, LEK, TIGER166
N: + OTHER BOXERS enter. They're given a SECURITY CHECK. Guards search them and their gym bags. Chains and shackles are removed. Nearby, FAMILIES wait in line as their bags are inspected.
S: EXT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: COURTYARD - LATE DAY - WIDE:
N: It's huge, filled with people. Guards and Prisoners, Families visiting. Some play basketball, some gamble, others talk and laugh with their loved ones. Lady Boys, dressed as Ring Card Girls, are in a separate caged area, putting on makeup. In the center of the yard, a BOXING RING is being prepared: Prisoners set the canvas (a giant logo: "Department of Corrections"); they secure the ropes, and corner pads. A gallery of chairs around it.
C: BILLY
D: sits alone. He watches other boxers with their families. Pon, Tiger, etc. Lek, holding and kissing his INFANT SON. Then, Billy looks away and quietly stares at the ring.
C: ANGLE, OFFICER PI SIT.
D: talking to Government Officials. He sees Billy sitting alone, walks over and sits. They both watch the families and prisoners interact for a moment. Then:
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: I talked to your Mother. She could no afford airfare, but she sends her love.
N: Billy is silent.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: They say boxers should have no pleasure before fight.
N: BILLY
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: They say it softens you,-- steals your hunger.
C: BILLY
D: Well maybe "they" are full of shit.
N: Officer Pi Sit smiles. Billy's loneliness is evident.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: The man you fight tonight, he no deserve to ever leave prison...So he'll do anything he can to win.
N: BEAT, THEN:
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: But you... You had to go to prison in order to be free.
E: off Billy's look
N: Billy is still. Hard truth.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LARGE CELL: MAX. SECURITY PRISON - NIGHT - BILLY
N: lies on a table, in this improvised locker room. Nan is giving Billy a pre-fight massage...Applying heated oil to the skin, the scars, the back tattoo, working the muscles with his hands. It's very quiet but intense, ritualistic, as wel FEEL the BUZZ in the air... Lek, Tiger, a few other boxers enter the cell. All sweating, breathing hard, just having fought. Billy sits up. Alert.
S: INT. BATHROOM: MAX. SECURITY PRISON - NIGHT - BILLY
N: enters. Alone, he looks in the mirror, touches his chest nervously. Eyes closed, he prays. Focus and intensity builds... FADE IN SOUNDS of a distant crowd. Fights underway. CHANTING. SHOUTING. MUAY THAI MUSIC on the loudspeakers. There's a knock on the door. Billy opens it:
C: NAN
D: It's time.
N: CU'S: BILLY -- as he pulls on his cup guard, then his shorts. -- as Nan tapes his hands. -- as an OFFICIAL signs the tape. -- as Lek ties Prajiads around his biceps -- a garland of flowers around his neck. -- then the gloves. -- Billy bows as Nan puts the Mongkhon on his head. He's ready. I/E. MAX. SECURITY PRISON - NIGHT - FOLLOW BILLY with Nan and Lek, as he leaves the cell and makes the VERY LONG WALK down a corridor, lined with cells... The TIGER TATTOO vibrant on Billy'S back. Prisoners cheering, some taunting, other reach through the bars and pat him... Billy keeps moving, eyes charged, fixed ahead, shadowboxing a few punches as he goes... DOWN A FLIGHT OF STEPS into the bowels of THE YARD, where SIGHT/SOUNDS EXPLODE. Prison spotlights REVEAL THE YARD IS PACKED. Around the ring, a sea of prisoners. Guards in uniforms, Gov. Officials. Numerous families throughout. The NOISE builds to deafening levels as Billy makes his way toward the ring, and steps OVER the top rope...
S: INT. RING - WITH BILLY
N: as he enters. And we're seeing him, now, at this moment, as a full Muay Thai warrior. Another ROAR sweeps over the crowd...His opponent entering the ring...And Billy turns to face the man who intends death for him: DIESEL CHOR (25, pure malevolence). Prisoners ROAR for him. Billy and Diesel walk the ring, opposite sides, praying to each corner, touching the ropes, "sealing" the ring... Ceremonial music begins...Billy and Diesel both perform the Ram Muay. As Billy moves rhythmically, in time to the music, his arms and legs telling his journey w/beatific precision...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LADY BOY CELL - NIGHT - JOM
N: with May and Char are watching a small TV, chatting up a storm. Women's bras, thongs, hang on wires. Perfume and makeup abound. Jom watches Billy on TV intently, sees him perform the Ram Muay as she taught him.
S: BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NIGHT - BILLY
N: FEELS the spirit now rising inside him...When he finishes the Ram Muay, the music cuts out. Billy locks eyes with Officer Pi Sit, ringside, for a moment. Then, Billy heads to his corner, lowers his head so Nan can remove the Mongkhon... They pray together, head-to-head... The crowd baying for blood, grows louder... LOUDER now... Then, suddenly, abruptly--
T: CUT TO BLACK/SMASH TO:
N: THE BELL;
S: INT. RING - ROUND ONE - BOTH
N: rush in. A measured pace at first. Billy and Diesel circling, feinting, like a storm brewing... Billy fires jabs and teeps with a balance and deftness we haven't seen before... Diesel, taking shots, trying to cut the ring, but Billy evades... UNTIL: DIESEL'S TRAINER shouts something Thai. And Diesel fires an OVERHAND RIGHT that Billy doesn't see and hits him like a pole-ax. Billy's entire body feels it. (So do we.) A barrage of pulverizing kicks, elbows and punches follow, Billy trying to cover up. Diesel's attack goes through like bullets. It's fast. It's shocking. Hurts to watch. And -- THE BELL. Diesel throws Billy down, smiles. The crowd ROARS; the Ref warns him. Billy gets up, goes back to his corner. Ringside: Officer Pi Sit watches, concerned.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SAMURAI CELL - NIGHT - KENG, KIAW + ALL SAMURAI
N: watch the fight on their shitty TV. They argue, shove and shout, wildly gambling cigarettes, as-- BACK TO: MAX. SECURITY PRISON/RING: BILLY'S CORNER - BILLY breathes, panicking. Nan and Lek work his legs.
C: BILLY
D: He's too strong!
C: NAN
D: Breathe, Billy. Have calm.
C: BILLY
D: I can't keep him off me!
C: NAN
D: You can!
C: BILLY
D: --No--
C: NAN
D: -- Remember what I teach you! Remember what you fight for!
N: A LADY BOY WALKS THE RING WITH A CARD FOR ROUND TWO. AND THE BELL. ROUND TWO Billy is under attack in seconds. Diesel firing in punches. Billy bounces off the ropes just as Diesel strikes with a flying knee that CRASHES into Billy's forehead-- then Diesel spins him around and KICKS BOTH LEGS OUT from under him. Billy goes down hard. HIS HEART STARTS POUNDING. Billy clutches his sternum, takes a breath and fights through it. The Ref counts. Nan and Lek shout from the corner in Thai.
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - NOI
N: sits up close to the TV. Eyebrows shaved. Worried for Billy. The Football Team, remaining Boxing Team watch in the b.g.
S: INT. LADY BOY CELL - NIGHT - JOM
N: also worried. May and Char shout at the TV in Thai for Billy to get up.
S: BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - BILLY
N: staggers up. Diesel resumes his assault. Billy tries to grab as Diesel drives him into a corner, where a STORM OF KNEES batter his legs and organs. Billy, taking HUGE SHOTS, can't escape, then--
C: CU, BILLY
D: under a BLUR of shots, something in him SLOWS...CALMS -- AS IF SPIRITUAL...HE/WEE SEE a split-second opening in Diesel's attack and Billy FIRES -- a COUNTER PUNCH that hits and hurts Diesel. His face is damaged. He staggers back.
N: THE CROWD ROARS.
S: INT. SAMURAI CELL - KENG, KIAW + ALL THE SAMURAI
N: go wild. Cigarettes flying. Shouting, cheering, cursing, as--
S: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NIGHT - BILLY
N: bores in...nailing Diesel with aggressive kicks, elbows and teeps, that knock Diesel back to a corner. Billy unloads: PUNCH AFTER PUNCH AFTER PUNCH!! THE CROWD GOES CRAZY. Even Officer Pi Sit.
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - NOI
N: is excited, squealing with laughter, and --
S: BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NIGHT
N: THE BELL. And the Referee yanks them apart. SUDDENLY BILLY'S GASTRAL TRACK LURCHES and Billy doubles over, again clutching his sternum.
S: INT. BILLY'S CORNER - BILLY
N: sits. Nan and Lek feverishly rub Billy's legs. Billy spits in the bucket: it's a lot of blood.
C: NAN
D: You okay, Billy?! You alright?!
C: BILLY
D: ...yeah...
C: NAN
D: You SEE, Billy?! You FEEL it?! Muay Thai in HERE-- And HERE-- Now, FIGHT! Khun samarth chna!
E: pokes Billy's heart pokes Billy's mind
S: INT. DIESEL'S CORNER - HIS TRAINERS
N: shouting advice. A DIFFERENT LADY BOY WALKS THE RING WITH ROUND THREE CARD. AND THE BELL.
S: INT. RING - ROUNDS THREE + FOUR
N: They trade. Back and forth. Both fighters standing ground, creating angles, traps, dodging and attacking. "The Art of Eight Limbs" in full force. They slam into a clinch (reminiscent of the exercise with Pon). But this time, Billy throws Diesel down. Diesel jumps up immediately and attacks Billy; AND THE BELL. BILLY AND DIESEL CONTINUE TO FIGHT AFTER THE BELL. The crowd roars, shifting momentum, rooting for Billy, the Crazy Farang.
S: INT. LADY BOY CELL - JOM, MAY + CHAR
N: chattering, clapping, watching another LADY BOY on TV walk the ring with a card for ROUND 5.
S: INT. BILLY'S CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS
N: rubbing Billy's legs that are brutally swollen at the tendons around the calves and knees. He struggles to breathe.
C: NAN
D: Last round! No get tired now!
C: BILLY
D: I won't!
C: NAN
D: No go down, Billy! Need last round to win!
C: BILLY
D: Okay.
C: NAN
D: Okay?!
C: BILLY
D: Okay!!
N: WE DON'T HEAR A BELL. INSTEAD, WE SLAM HARD RIGHT INTO--
S: INT. RING - MID-ROUND FIVE - DIESEL'S BARRAGE
N: has Billy hurt. A right to the jaw then three knees to the ribs knocks the wind out of Billy. He stumbles to his left. Diesel takes advantage and fires a left lead kick that almost knocks Billy down. They grapple, shove each other off. Both boxers exhausted, it's a matter of will. Trading shots. As Billy finds, masterfully, his distance, his timing, he chops a hard kick to Diesel's thigh that buckles him. THE HUNGRY CROWD ON IT'S FEET. Even Officer Pi Sit, who jumps up from his seat, CHEERING BILLY, as -- Billy RUSHES in -- -- but mid-charge, his GASTRAL TRACK LURCHES AGAIN. HEART POUNDING, DANGEROUSLY FAST. BILLY GRIMACES IN PAIN, AS -- DIESEL COMES RIGHT BACK, SLAMMING IN SHOTS. BILLY FIGHTS THROUGH THE PAIN. PUSHING HIMSELF. IT'S BACK AND FORTH -- BOTH MEN LANDING.... UNTIL A SOLID COMBO STAGGERS DIESEL...BILLY GOES FOR THE FINISH -- SEVERAL CHOPPING KICKS -- THAT BRUTALLY, FINALLY KNOCK DIESEL'S ENTIRE LOWER BODY BACKWARDS AND DROPS HIM ON HIS FACE. Diesel writhes in agony. The Ref pushes Billy back. Diesel is counted out. The Ref raises Billy's hand. CROWD GOES CRAZY.
S: INT. LADY BOY CELL - NIGHT - JOM, MAY + CHAR
N: all on their feet. Chatting, clapping. A smile comes to Jom's face, as--
S: INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - NOI
N: His face filled, with emotion. Watching his friend win.
S: BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NOW - BILLY
N: is swarmed by Nan, Lek, Pon, Tiger, and the rest of the team that floods the ring. Officer Pi Sit climbs in and congratulates him. AND SUDDENLY, ABRUPTLY, ALL SOUND CUTS OUT. BILLY/WE SEE ALL THE EXCITEMENT AROUND HIM IN THE RING AND CROWD, PEOPLE TALKING, CHEERING, ETC... FOR NOW, IT'S PERFECTLY SOUNDLESS. Then, Billy's knees buckle...and he COLLAPSES to the canvas. On his back. Eyes roll to WHITE. His body in shock, CONVULSES VIOLENTLY -- as BLOOD fills his mouth and he starts to CHOKE. The team gathers around him, all shouting in Thai (We can't hear any of it). Nan rolls Billy onto his side, and blood pours out... Nan reaches into Billy's mouth, digs out his tongue. Officer Pi Sit shouts to all security, this terrible silence,
T: and CUT TO--
S: INT. PRISON AMBULANCE (MOVING HIGH SPEED) - NIGHT - BILLY
N: lies in back, eyes rolled, breathing erratic. A MEDIC puts an oxygen mask on his nose. The siren wails. We do not see the GUARDS faces as they drive Billy to the hospital. BLACK.
S: EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - WIDE
N: The yard is empty. We hear a TRUSTEE'S VOICE over the loudspeaker:
C: TRUSTEE'S VOICE
D: William Moore, yat yeim...William Moore, yat yeim.
N: No sign of Billy.
S: INT. VISITING ROOM - DAY
N: A MAN is waiting (50's, white, UK). He is alone. No one else is in the visiting area. He is still for a VERY LONG MOMENT. Finally, a Guard emerges.
C: GUARD
D: Sorry, Mister Moore. We no can find your son.
C: MR. MOORE
D: It's okay. I'll come back.
E: nods
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GOV. HOSPITAL: RECOVERY ROOM (DAYS LATER) - BILLY
N: stirs awake. He sees a light overhead and an air vent working. Billy takes a moment to get his bearings...Lying in a clean bed, white sheets, quiet surroundings. There's a large post- op bandage on his side where a drain was removed. Then Billy looks down, SEES his ankles are shackled/chained. A PATIENT in a neighboring bed stares at him awkwardly. HOLD ON BILLY, THIS VERY LONG AND AWFUL MOMENT...then, he slowly sits up, turns to a window, peers out; REVEAL NOW: We're in a GOVERNMENT HIGH RISE, overlooking the city of Bangkok -- 20 stories below. Billy pushes opens the window, BREATHING IN FRESH AIR...HE LOOKS OVER THE LEDGE...A LOOOONGGG WAY DOWN. There's a sudden SOUND. Billy drops back into bed, just as the door opens and a NURSE walks in.
C: BILLY
D: Nurse. `Think I should go to the loo.
N: Nurse helps Billy out of bed. She looks down at his chains, then hands him a SARONG. Billy wraps the sarong around his waist, covering the chains.
S: INT. CORRIDOR: GOV. HOSPITAL - BILLY
N: as the Nurse escorts him...They pass a GUARD seated at a nearby desk. He hardly glances over from the TV he's watching. The Nurse leads Billy around the corner to the bathroom. She waits as he goes in alone.
S: INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM - BILLY
N: pisses in the urinal, then goes to the mirror and looks at himself. He washes his hands and face. Then walks out...
S: INT. CORRIDOR: GOV. HOSPITAL
N: ...and finds an empty corridor. The Nurse is gone. Billy peers around the corner, SEES the Nurse talking to an AIDE down the hall. PAUSE...THEN; Billy moves to an elevator and quickly taps the button. The elevator door slides open...and Billy FREEZES. Inside: is a DOCTOR and two NURSES. They all STARE at Billy.
C: DOCTOR
D: Going down?
N: Billy nods, steps in, SLOW, careful not to shake the chains.
S: INT. ELEVATOR (DESCENDING) - BILLY
N: avoids eye contact. Instead, he focuses on the floor lights dropping: 9...8...7- DING! Door opens: two more DOCTORS get in. Billy tenses. The descent resumes: 6- DING! Door opens again: now an ORDERLY w/a WHEELCHAIR PATIENT enters. Billy edges to the back corner; Floor by floor, the elevator keeps stopping. Rapidly filling with NURSES, DOCTORS, ORDERLIES and PATIENTS. We can FEEL Billy's panic in this now crowded elevator, descending agonizingly slow... It finally reaches the LOBBY. Everyone files out, until Billy is alone. He steps out carefully, minding the chains...
S: INT. LOBBY: GOV. HOSPITAL - DAY - BILLY
N: turns a corner, into the LOBBY. It's full-to-bursting with PEOPLE waiting for medical attention. Some in plastic chairs, wounded and sickly. Some on the floor. Others on gurneys, shoved against the walls. The Staff under siege, outnumbered. BILLY'S POV: at the far end of the lobby, is the EXIT TO THE STREET. Pulse racing, nervous, Billy moves toward it...ever-tiny steps, so NOT to hear the chains...step by step. A few people look at him curiously. Billy, heart pounding through his chest now, just reaches the exit and --
S: EXT. HOSPITAL/CITY STREET - BILLY
N: bursts out. WE'RE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE ROAR OF BANGKOK'S RUSH HOUR. CARS/PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, OVERWHELMING BILLY AND US. Billy, sweating profusely, walks down the sidewalk, fast as the chains will allow (which isn't fast at all); He glances nervously back at the hospital, keeps walking....
S: EXT. BANGKOK: VARIOUS CITY STREETS - WITH BILLY
N: One city block after the next, navigating crowds, unsure where he's going. He turns down a quiet street lined with parked cars. He tries several car doors. All of them locked. Frustrated, scared, he looks across the street and STOPS. BILLY'S POV: A DRUG STORE. All lit up, open for business.
S: INT. DRUG STORE - DAY - BILLY
N: enters. It's empty. No customers. He heads to the back for the pharmacy counter...then SLOWS when he SEES... AN ENORMOUS FLOOR-TO-CEILING WALL OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS. (Painkillers, amphetamines, etc.) Billy stares, in awe. Billy's reverie snaps when a YOUNG PHARMACIST (Female, 25) appears behind the counter.
C: YOUNG PHARMACIST
D: Can I help you?
N: Billy just stands there. Staring. Realizes:
C: BILLY
D: ...no...
S: EXT. DRUG STORE - MOMENTS AFTER - BILLY
N: steps out to the street. Exhales. He watches people, cars, life go by. And suddenly it's clear. All the chaos in Billy's eyes is replaced with steel. He wants to live. And now he's walking. Toward the hospital. Walking faster. Determined. Faster and faster, toward the
T: hospital as we....CUT TO:
S: INT. RECOVERY WARD + ROOM - DAY - GUARD
N: looks up from his TV, oddly, at Billy walking in, sweating.
C: BILLY
D: -- How you doin'? Took a fuckin' helluva piss in there.
E: smiles
N: Billy enters his room, hoists himself into bed-- and right at that moment, the Recovery Ward door opens: it's Officer Pi Sit. Accompanied by two other GUARDS with SHOTGUNS. Without a word, they help Billy out of bed, cuff his wrists. E/I. BUREAU OF CORRECTION VAN - DAY, AFTER - BILLY is put in the back seat, next to Officer Pi Sit. The Guards up front, drive in silence....Then:
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: Why did you come back?
E: without looking at Billy
N: BEAT. Billy looks at him.
C: OFFICER PI SIT
D: You could be free. Why did you turn around?
C: BILLY
D: You saw me?
E: caught, stunned
N: Officer Pi Sit still won't look at him.
C: BILLY
D: I don't want to run anymore.
N: Billy waits for a response; Officer Pi Sit doesn't give one. And as they ride in THICK SILENCE, en route back to prison...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAYS LATER - MR. MOORE
N: is waiting in the Visiting Area alone. WE HOLD ON HIS FACE. THEN; TEXT ON SCREEN: After serving three years, Billy Moore was transferred to a UK prison and released on an amnesty by the King of Thailand in October 2010. Upon his return, he reconnected with his family. With the help of Narcotics Anonymous, Billy remains clean to this day, and works with other addicts who are in recovery. Now, a smile comes to Mr. Moore's face. Across from him, REVEAL: sits Billy. They look at each other for a LONG MOMENT, in deep silence. Emotion is palpable between them. Then, Billy smiles to his father.
T: CUT TO BLACK:
N: A PRAYER BEFORE DAWN
