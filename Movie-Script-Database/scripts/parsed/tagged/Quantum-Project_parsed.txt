S: INT. A BIOCHEMICAL LANDSCAPE
N: A violent electrical storm. Veins of light pulse outward, branching off into a spidery network of GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS We are inside a human brain. A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left, and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve. Passing the eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the retina) on which we see an image projected: AN UPSIDE DOWN COMPUTER SCREEN Neurons PING into the membrane: the picture suddenly FLIPS RIGHT SIDE UP and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse POV and
S: EXT. THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT - DAY
N: CLOSE ON A PAIR OF EYES Deep deep blue. Radiating more intelligence than wisdom. Inside each pupil is the reflection of a COMPUTER SCREEN. A deferential VOICE sounds from off camera.

N: Pentcho raises his blue eyes from the computer screen and up at ARLETTE (50's), his mannish Swiss assistant.
C: ARLETTE
D: We can start the descent now.
S: INT. THE LABORATORIES (MOVING) - DAY
N: A SERIES OF SHOTS as Pentcho and Arlette stride through the facility. They pass a group of green-tagged VISITORS and their Swiss-accented GUIDE.
C: GUIDE
D: Two hundred feet below us is the world's largest particle accelerator...
N: His VOICE continues on overlap as they reach a hallway.
C: GUIDE
D: 27 kilometers in circumference, the beam pipe actually runs beneath the borders of Switzerland and France...
E: OC CONT'D
C: PENTCHO
D: Did you get that data off to Braverman at Cal Tech?
N: They are facing the CAPSULE/ELEVATOR that leads to the tunnel.
C: ARLETTE
D: Done.
N: Next to the elevator, two plants are dying in their pots, their growing lamps off. Pentcho looks around, finds the plug, pushes it into the socket. The lights glow. He peers at a leaf: a tiny bug crawls across...

E: OC
C: ARLETTE
D: We need to progress.
N: He breaks out of it, swipes his I.D. card. The capsule doors WHOOSH open. Pentcho nods at the man inside. This is JACQUE, his accent heavily Italian.
C: JACQUE
D: Hey, it is 3-P-O! P, P, P! Professore Paulo Pentcho!
C: PENTCHO
D: That's not an official nickname, Jacque.
N: Pentcho looks from Jacque to Arlette, who blushes. Pentcho sits down in the heavily consoled captain's chair.
C: JACQUE
D: Beh! Eets just tun-nel humor.
N: The giant lab disappears from sight as they DROP twenty stories below the earth.
C: PENTCHO
D: Did they recalibrate the 3k turn?
N: Jacque nods. They hit bottom. Pentcho keys in data on the console computer as the capsule moves LATERALLY on a track parallel to the beam pipe, stopping in front of the RF CAVITY, bursting with a billion dollars worth of nanotechnology.

S: INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN FIELD - DAY
N: The camera surges forward into Pentcho's eyes: DOUBLE CLICK We see an image draw itself on the empty 'page' of the field: A BLACK DOT LOOPING INTO A STRING accompanied by the following thought text: "...two spatially separated particles will irresistibly attract..." MOUSE CLICK - A WOMAN'S FACE wide-set brown eyes brimming with emotion. A hint of a SONG playing somewhere in the BG. MOUSE CLICK to the previous 'page' where the LOOP has formed into a sheet moving through space, followed by the floating thought text: "...until the force of the collision fuses them into..."
C: PENTCHO'S VOICE
D: Ten, nine, eight...
N: MOUSE CLICK - POV: LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN AT the BROWN-EYED WOMAN, her face dreamy, her body naked beneath silk sheets. PULL BACK: she's floating on an enormous Renaissance mural - a wedding scene - that is a bedroom floor. Off in the corner, PENTCHO sits hunched over a clunky laptop, his fingers dancing, dervish-like, across the keyboard.
C: PENTCHO'S VOICE
D: Four, three, two...
E: CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: Then goodbye...
N: CRACK! Suddenly, the woman drifts away. Pentcho looks up: THEIR EYES LOCK WITH LONGING AS:
S: INT. THE CAPSULE CONSOLE - SAME TIME
N: Pentcho's FINGER depresses the START button.
S: INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR - DAY
N: as we follow the PULSE SIGNAL from the keyboard to the CPU, across the LOCAL AREA NETWORK to the MAINFRAME in the RF cavity, sending its own signal into the BEAM PIPE, where two soon-to-be accelerated ELECTRONS are released, like horses bolting from the same starting gate, but in opposite directions. THE ROLLER-COASTER RIDE BEGINS. POV - ONE LIGHT INFUSED ELECTRON BLASTING through the beam pipe like a COMET, fused inside of a looping, twenty seven kilometer single lane race track. WHOOOSH! As the electron accelerates, so too does the sound, rushing to GUT SPLITTING, EAR WRENCHING DB'S. Heading around the turn, it barrels STRAIGHT INTO THE PATH OF THE SECOND ELECTRON on its own speed-of light power surge. HERE COMES THE IMPACT POINT... but SCREEEEECH! What disc brakes might sound like, slammed to the floor of a vehicle travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per hour. SUDDENLY THE ELECTRON HAS STOPPED, SUSPENDED, its phosphorescent glow trained like a spotlight on: PENTCHO - EXTREME CLOSE UP the dual computer screens reflecting out of his pupils, again. A VOICE speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:
C: FEMALE VOICE
D: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
N: The camera SURGES into Pentcho's eyes as the brain field opens to the sounds of a nine alarm fire. DING DING DING DING DING! The thought text marches by in giant, attention-getting letters: "ELECTRONS DON'T TALK!"
C: FEMALE VOICE
D: WHAT DO YOU WANT, PAUL?
E: CONT CONT'D
N: More thought text scrolls by on the field, now in RED LETTERS: "I'm having a psychotic episode." The field collapses back into PENTCHO, ashen-faced, watching his computer screen, and seeing: the cursor (electron) blinking.
C: JACQUE'S VOICE
D: Impact!
N: Suddenly, we are back inside the pipe, HURTLING toward KABLOOM! THE SUB-ATOMIC EXPLOSION A particle meteor shower of magnificent proportions. They glow and charge off and disappear, as the laws of E=mc2 take visual flight inside this billion dollar kaleidoscope.

S: INT. THE AIRPLANE (PENTCHO) - DAY
N: puts down a drink glass on the tray table of the seat next to him. Places headphones onto his ears. Fiddles with the music channels: country, stand-up, classical... Stays put on a Mozart concerto. He gazes back out at the clouds, fails to notice that HIS DRINK GLASS IS MOVING sliding slowly across the tray table. It stops near the edge and waits, as Pentcho looks up from the window. As his head drifts back toward the clouds outside THE GLASS MOVES ACROSS THE TRAY TABLE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
S: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
N: Pentcho's plane touches down.
S: INT. A RED VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE - DRIVING
N: On the freeway, heading for Berkeley, in eternal rush hour. Stop, go, sixty miles per hour, then five, then thirty. Pentcho drives, distracted, stares at his own eyes reflected in the rear view mirror. The camera SURGES in: CLICK
S: INT. FLASHBACK - AIRPLANE - DAY
N: It's Pentcho himself, on the airplane, listening to Mozart. In the foreground, the tray table and glass. In the BG, his eyes fixed aimlessly on the clouds outside. Suddenly, Pentcho's face SPLITS INTO TWO DIMENSIONS One stays focused forward, while the SECOND ONE turns to the side and watches in amazement as THE GLASS SLIDES ACROSS THE OPEN TRAY TABLE Suddenly a horn BLARES, and CRASH!
S: INT/EXT. THE BEETLE (PENTCHO) - DAY
N: SLAMS into the car in front of him, triggering SLOW MOTION EFFECT A three car COLLISION with Pentcho in the middle, an object lesson in physics seen from ten different camera angles: SCREECH CRUNCH CRUNCH Bumpers crumple, metal tears, human molecules SNAP forward. POP POP POP! Like gunfire, bullet AIRBAGS clamp the drivers' heads back against their headrests.
S: INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN - DAY
N: The field ROCKS SIDEWAYS, in total OVERLOAD, so flooded with messages that each one is undecipherable.
S: EXT. THE FREEWAY ACCIDENT SITE - DAY
N: The three cars form a tangled metal sculpture. Incredibly, as Pentcho himself sees, they are all RED VW BEETLES. He sits in a daze. A man's voice interrupts, scaling up into a SHOUT.
C: VOICE
D: What the hell were you thinking? What? I want to know! WHAT?!!
N: This is WILL (30's), a scratch over one eye, peering in at Pentcho, still behind the air bag/steering wheel, craning his stiffening neck forward and back at the crumpled row of red automobiles. He blinks, then answers in an eerie voice.
C: PENTCHO
D: Probability of this happening, same make, model, color and year is less likely than the proof for the existence of God.
C: WILL
D: Sorry I asked. You got insurance?
E: seething beat
S: EXT. THE FREEWAY SITE (LIGHT RAIN IS FALLING) - DAY
N: A tow truck backs up to Pentcho's car. He stands, dazed, off on the shoulder, luggage next to him. His eyes drift toward Will, giving instructions into his cell phone.

N: A woman from the Durango is approaching, as Will, back on the phone, argues with his boss.
C: WILL
D: I'll be there, Trent. Yes. 20 minutes --
N: Click. Will reddens, sees the sunglassed face of the woman, looking past him and over to PENTCHO, signing the tow truck papers. The battered front end of his Beetle CRANKS upward.
C: WILL
D: Son-of-a-bitch. As if it was my fault I got rear-ended by...
E: CONT'D
N: The woman stares, curiously, at Pentcho.
C: WILL

E: CONT'D
N: She doesn't hear him. Takes off her sunglasses, slowly. Wide-set brown eyes.
C: WOMAN

S: INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN - (PRESENT DAY MIA)
N: overlapped by another photograph that slowly comes into focus - top third, middle third, bottom - like a downloading Internet image from his personal files. IT'S MIA, YOUNGER, THE SAME WIDE-SET DARK EYES Pentcho's heartbeat pounds LOUDER, drowning out the whisper:

D: I've been dreaming about you.
E: CONT'D

S: EXT. HEADING TO XANADU (A SERIES OF INTERCUTS) - DAY
N: as the Durango motors into the alpine landscape. Mia turns, looks at her former lover. He stares back, smiles.
C: MIA
D: Why am I doing this?
C: PENTCHO
D: It's an experiment.
N: Mia turns onto a private road. A MANSION appears in the distance, cresting the hill. 23a EXT/INT. XANADU - NIGHT 23a A massive wooden door. Mia holds a flashlight, slips an oversized key into the lock and turns. POV: THROUGH THE DOORWAY An enormous hall. Scaffolding rises from the stone floor. Forty foot high walls are draped in thick sheets of plastic. They enter like thieves. 23b INT. XANADU - A SHORT TIME LATER 23b Mia stands on top of an eight foot riser. Pentcho passes up harnesses and rope to her outstretched hands.
C: MIA
D: We flopped the first time out.
C: PENTCHO
D: At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic. They connect in unimaginable ways.
N: Mia slings the gear over her shoulder. Looks very much in her element.
C: MIA
D: And you think this is relevant to our relationship?
N: Pentcho starts his own climb up the scaffolding. Reaches the first plank.
C: PENTCHO
D: Could be.
C: MIA
D: What universe are you in, Paul?
E: wryly
C: PENTCHO
D: A quantum one.
N: 23c INT. A HIGHER SCAFFOLDING - A SHORT TIME LATER 23c Pentcho clips a safety line to his belt. The two of them wear yellow hardhats and climbing harnesses. They suddenly KICK OFF the scaffold and DANGLE twenty five feet above the stone floor. Hand over fist, they start to ascend, hoisting themselves up the tug ropes.
C: PENTCHO
D: The shorthand is, when you send electrons through space, it's impossible to say precisely what they are: particles or waves.
N: They spin around slowly like tops as they hoist themselves up.
C: PENTCHO
D: They come into being as one or the other at the moment we observe them.
E: CONT'D
N: His words echo off the giant walls.
C: PENTCHO
D: Nothing is real until it's perceived.
E: CONT'D
C: MIA
D: The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
C: PENTCHO
D: How?
N: Mia reaches an electric box, hanging a yard below the ceiling.
C: MIA
D: Baby, reality is what you choose to make it.
N: She flips the switch. A set of lights FLARE ON. Pentcho swallows a breath. In awe.
C: PENTCHO
D: God.
N: WE SEE WHAT HE SEES: A GIANT RENAISSANCE-STYLE FRESCO COVERS THE ENTIRE CEILING. Flocks of ANGELS fly above a GODDESS. Cherubs. Heralds. Pentcho's face flushes. He's exhilarated. She takes note:
C: MIA
D: But only if you live your life that way. If you experience every moment as discovery.
N: Pentcho's already there. He kicks his legs out. Joyrides on the tug rope, arcing back and forth like a mad pendulum.
C: PENTCHO
D: Mia! You're restoring heaven with dabs of paint. You're bringing new order to the universe.
N: She beams from his excitement.
C: MIA
D: I always said we were in the same business...
N: His wayward motion swings him STRAIGHT INTO HER. They lock arms. The ropes shudder.
C: PENTCHO
D: If you're right, we have a chance. To be together.
E: beat
N: Pentcho reaches out to kiss her. Doesn't see that their collision has jogged the clutch on his harness rope. Now it opens all the way. WHOOSH! In an instant, he's gripping air, FALLING at the speed of Newton's discovery. He hurtles downward in slow motion. There's a SOUND rushing in behind him, the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE. Pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder: the angels, the goddess, Mia, all of it has been SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE... as Pentcho's eyes stare for a millisecond at THE VOID. NOTHINGNESS. NADA. And then he's FALLING again, accelerating toward his own last particle collision, when a VOICE murmurs from somewhere.
C: VOICE
D: I'm not done.
E: OC
N: THWACK! The safety line holds, dangling Pentcho a meter above the stone floor. 23d INT. XANADU - SOME TIME LATER 23d They camp on old couch cushions, side by side, staring up at the illuminated fresco. Pentcho is bruised, battered, vulnerable.
C: PENTCHO
D: When I was a kid I used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to catch a glimpse behind me.
N: Mia props her head up on one elbow.
C: MIA
D: Of what?
N: ON THE FRESCO: A CHORUS OF ANGELS
C: PENTCHO
D: God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness. Mia.
N: It's a plea. She turns, stares directly into his eyes.
C: PENTCHO
D: The universe is snapping my head back. I'm losing my focus.
E: CONT'D
N: Mia's face fills with light. Her best smile.
C: MIA
D: Welcome, Paul. Welcome.
N: She traces a line from his forehead to the bridge of his nose, quoting Yeats (from "The Second Coming") as a celebration:
C: MIA
D: "Things fall apart; the center will not hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."
E: CONT'D
N: He pulls her close to him. They lie, spooned together, breathing in unison, gazing up at the painted heaven. A firefly enters from outside, flutters in the air above them, blushing a trace line of yellow light.
C: PENTCHO
D: An electron spoke to me yesterday. I swear.
E: beat
N: Mia tries to suppress a giggle. Can't.
C: MIA
D: What did it want?
C: PENTCHO
D: That's what it asked me. "What do you want?" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment.
C: MIA
D: Like now?
N: He hesitates, then surrenders to the fact.
C: PENTCHO
D: Yes.
N: The firefly dances above them. Pentcho sits up (and away from her). Mock serious:
C: PENTCHO
D: Did you know electrons have lovers?
E: CONT'D
N: Mia notes his distance. Faces him, cross-legged.
C: MIA
D: No. I didn't. I'm listening.
E: dryly
C: PENTCHO
D: Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
N: She looks, sees him disappear into his head.
C: PENTCHO

E: CONT'D
N: The vulnerability is gone. And Mia, with it.

C: PENTCHO
D: A five hundred foot thick steel wall. But the connection between these two electrons is so --
E: plowing ahead
C: MIA
D: Dysfunctional --
C: PENTCHO
D: That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
C: MIA

N: Silence. The story hangs between them like a fog.
C: MIA
D: Don't science me Paul. What do you want?

S: INT. PENTCHO'S COTTAGE - ENTERING
N: An alternately stark and cluttered space, less lived in than occupied by a man on the run between his office and his mind. Rivulets of water run from an open window, across a large desk, and down onto the wood floor. Pentcho scans around, unfazed. Locates a towel. Mops up. Dries off the computer and keyboard. Bag still on his shoulder, he fires up the machine and logs ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN E-mail. Lots of it. Hundreds and hundreds of messages scrolling by on the screen. He turns away, sees his own rain soaked clothes forming a puddle on the floor. LIGHTNING cascades across the sky, visible through the large bay window behind the desk. Pentcho's eyes stray back to the screen STILL SCROLLING E-MAIL MESSAGES as the thunder follows almost immediately. CRACK! He looks up: Veins of light pulse outward, branching into a spidery network OF GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS A voice SOUNDS from somewhere non-local:

N: The sign says: "Hollywood - North. Long Beach, San Pedro - South."
S: EXT. SAN PEDRO/HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The rain has stopped. The red bug parks in front of a GRAND HOUSE GONE TO SEED. Ditto the neighborhood. A 7-Eleven sign blinks on the corner. Pentcho walks up the cracked sidewalk to a sagging wooden porch. Looks for signs of life. A light. Something. He pushes on the front door. Locked. Rummages through his key ring in the dark. Slides one into the top lock. Won't turn. Tries another key. Gets stuck. He pulls it out. Presses his face close against the window. TIRES SCREECH. POLICE SIRENS BLARE. Pentcho turns, his EYES lit by the flashing bubble lights.

N: bursts into the darkened foyer. His foot catches on a thick doormat. He SPRAWLS forward as A GUNSHOT ERUPTS ABOVE HIS HEAD He drops, convulsed with fear. Snaps his head back to see: THE EINSTEIN MAN (ALEXANDER) in bathrobe and slippers, hands shaking around a shotgun.
C: ALEXANDER
D: Paul... Pauly...

S: INT. BAR AREA (A TEA KETTLE WHISTLES) - NIGHT

D: 22 I built the first machine to transfer digital bits over a land line. I wrote the TCP/IP protocol before thirty. This mind , the one and only, was OBGYN at the birth of the Internet. And where has it taken me?
E: CONT'D tapping his temples
N: He shoots upright. Peers out the row of double sash windows, covered by impenetrable iron grates.

S: EXT. SAN PEDRO WHARF - NIGHT
N: Pentcho slogs down the wharf. Running from it. Looking for it. Past homeless people slipping in and out of the shadows. He snaps his head back over his shoulder, sees an OLD WOMAN playing the accordian. She stops. Her eyes bore in on his own.

He stops dead in his tracks, tries one last time to play gunfighter with the quantum reality: HE SNAPS HIS HEAD BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER and we see him, making the same move, from four different camera angles: from his LEFT, his RIGHT, from the TOP OF HIS HEAD, and looking up FROM GROUND ZERO as HE FINALLY WINS THE DRAW. The RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE is unleashed. Here it comes, rolling in with a giant WHOOSHING SOUND... POV PENTCHO: WATCHING REALITY SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE The ships, the dock, the harbor OBLITERATED by an onrushing, transparent cloud of NOTHINGNESS, EMPTINESS, a tabula rasa superimposed upon the disappeared wharf. ON PENTCHO, FALLING TO HIS KNEES hammered by his own victory, numb from shock and ecstasy, staring into the void as we surge forward
S: INT. THE BRAIN FIELD
N: It's completely blank, just like the void. The VITALS are flatlined. A single piece of thought text floats across the emptiness, almost like a screen saver: Say Uncle.... Say Uncle...
S: EXT. THE WHARF - (A VOICE) - NIGHT
C: VOICE
D: Uncle, hey...
N: A face, peering down at Pentcho. The face belongs to the MAGIC MAN, in a mad hatter hat, and a potpourri of found item clothing. Like a Baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit:
C: MAGIC MAN
D: Can you feel it, uncle? Can you feel it right down to your bones?!
N: ON PENTCHO: EXTREME CLOSE UP Inside each pupil is the reflection of the NEON HEART. We pull back on Pentcho's face. Calm. Serene.
C: PENTCHO
D: Yes. Yes I can.
E: beat
S: EXT. ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Pentcho turns the key, effortlessly opens the front door.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HOUSE - AN ORNATE TILE SHOWER - NIGHT
N: He stands beneath the stream of hot water, cleansing himself of a day that began a very long time ago.
S: INT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Pentcho dresses, taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes against his body. He sits down on the bed. Sees a clock. 5:00 a.m. TUGS UP one of the double sash windows that faces the 7-Eleven. VOICES rise from the parking lot. Pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread, eyes on the carved plaster ceiling. Suddenly, floating up through the open window:
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: What do you want?!
N: Pentcho cranes his head.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Tell me! Now! Now!
E: CONT'D
N: The old sash falls shut. BOOM. It's like a dam bursting inside him, only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous GUFFAWS. The sound rocks the house. Pentcho's smile is a mile wide. His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the FRONT DOORBELL RINGS He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs.
S: INT. THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT
N: Alexander's already there, ushering MIA inside to:
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - AT THE MOMENT THAT
N: Pentcho arrives. He stops, incredulous, at the sight of her.
C: ALEXANDER
D: Guess who's coming to dinner.
N: Mia jumps right in. To Pentcho:
C: MIA
D: I didn't want to leave things the way we did. Not this time.
C: PENTCHO
D: Wait. I want to tell you something.
N: He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living room. She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL.
C: MIA
D: I've been dreaming about this.
C: PENTCHO
D: Then you get it. You'll understand.
E: excited
C: MIA
D: What?
N: His face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon the pirate's treasure.
C: PENTCHO
D: I know what I want. I let go, and a second later you materialized at the door. You see?
N: CLOSE ON PENTCHO feeling the feelings.
C: PENTCHO
D: Mia. I can create reality. I can choose to love you with all my heart.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Tears pool along the rims of her eyes. She stares straight at him, hiding nothing.
C: MIA
D: You know those people who won't be photographed because they're afraid you're stealing their souls...? I came to take back my picture. The one I keep leaving with you.
E: long beat
N: His heart deflates. His voice follows. Barely audible:
C: PENTCHO
D: Why?
C: MIA
D: So I can move on. You too.
N: A horn blares from outside.
C: MIA
D: Be who you are, Paul. I love who you are. I do.
E: CONT'D
N: She turns and runs out the front door.
S: EXT. ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT
N: Mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend WILL holds open the passenger door of the red Durango.
C: MIA'S VOICE
D: I'll drive.
N: She circles the car, disappears behind the wheel. Will gets in his side. ON THE FRONT PORCH Pentcho, agitated, pushes open the door. Alexander's already outside, watching Mia motor off. He turns, stares at his son.
C: ALEXANDER
D: Do you want to think about it some more?
N: PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB. Jumps into the Beetle. The headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night.
S: INT. THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT
N: Mia grips the wheel with two hands. Will feigns nonchalance.
C: WILL
D: You okay?
N: She nods. Barely. They merge onto the highway.
S: INT. THE BEETLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT
N: Pentcho grips the wheel. Eyes focused. We surge into
S: INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN FIELD - OPENING ON
N: PEARLS, PLAYING OUT, LOOPING INTO A STRING whose shape recalls the original brain field. Thought text scrolls below, accompanied now by Pentcho's own inner voice.
C: VOICE AND TEXT
D: Each part of physical reality is constructed of all the other parts...
N: EXTREME CLOSE-UP, ON A SINGLE PEARL inside of which, the entire strand is reflected.
S: VOICE AND TEXT (CONT'D)
N: A web of connections created by the interdependence of all things... The field collapses back into:
S: INT. MIA IN THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT
N: eyes on the rear view mirror, as a horn BLARES from the entrance to the Long Beach bridge. She re-checks the mirror, filled with bobbing headlight beams. One beam LOCKS ON, straight into the center of the glass, blinding her for a split second. She blinks. Gasps to herself as the beam seems to LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR and train its phosphorescent glow on: MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP the point of light reflecting out of her pupils. PENTCHO'S VOICE speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:
C: PENTCHO'S VOICE
D: What do you want?
N: Mia blinks again. The beam is gone. She looks over at WILL, oblivious, checking his watch. BACK ON MIA the understanding flooding her eyes as SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER) And we see her making her move from FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES, from her left, right, up above, and from the back seat of the car as the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY... POV MIA: THE BRIDGE, THE CARS, THE BAY all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but THE VOID. NOTHINGNESS. NADA. CRASH!
S: INT. THE DURANGO (SLAMMING INTO THE CAR AHEAD) - NIGHT
N: triggering a chain reaction of vehicles fish-tailing across the bridge. In quick succession come a STREAM OF IMAGES: The pearls colliding... Mia and Will exchanging a LOOK... Traffic HALTING on the bridge... Will getting SCORCHED by the MAN they plowed into... Mia, exiting her side, looking BACK BEHIND HER... PENTCHO, ditching his Beetle, ten car lengths south... HE RUNS FORWARD, straight down the path of a tunnel-like headlight beam. MIA PICKS UP SPEED, churning from the other direction. PULL BACK: FROM THE BRIDGE as the two of them move toward the same point. Suddenly, tiny sparks of light GLOW and JUMP from portions of the bridge cable. SLOW MOTION: PENTCHO AND MIA gliding still closer. A VOICE sounds:
C: VOICE
D: Impact!
N: Their bodies CONNECT, arms intertwine, lips touch lips... PULL BACK - HIGHER It's like a plug in the socket of the physical landscape LIGHTING THE ENTIRE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM Every cell line, radio wave, satellite feed, fiber-optic cable, all stretching in every possible direction FROM BRIDGE TO SEA TO SKY pulsing outward into a spidery network of GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS. THE END
