S: A1 EXT. PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT A1
N: CLOSE ON... A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET BRIDGE." ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE. It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain. IN THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT
N: THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY. POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on... The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to his body. His left holds a GUN! Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man. ONLY SEE THE DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND. A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the camera...
C: KAREN CROSS
D: ... Police on scene are approaching the suspect. They're at the center of the Bridge now.
N: The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives. The Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: SUDDENLY... THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING OUT! SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 2.
C: KAREN CROSS

T: FADE IN:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS, HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND TONIC, is... DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood. The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face. IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE: most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)
C: KAREN CROSS
D: After a two month investigation, Det. Jason York has been relieved of duty for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John Curtis. Key testimony against York came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was on scene that night. The Seattle Police Department is handing this case over to the King County District Attorney's office. Criminal charges are expected.
E: OS
N: ON A TELEVISION SCREEN-- The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.
C: JENKINS
D: In a civilized society, the men and women entrusted with serving and protecting the community are to be held accountable just like everyone else. Simply put... Just because you are a cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to you. This is no longer the wild, wild west.
S: 3A EXT. KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY (THROUGH TV CAMERA) 3A
N: KAREN CROSS stands on the steps, a PHOTO of Conners appears. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 3.
C: KAREN CROSS

S: 3B INT. LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT 3B
N: Conners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of Conners and a YOUNG WOMAN (TEDDY) during happy times. He stares at the photo, finishes his drink.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: END OPENING CREDITS.
S: EXT. SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING
N: A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...
S: EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY
N: An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC, street and pedestrian, go about their business. ACROSS THE STREET... A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.
S: INT. BLACK TRUCK - DAY
N: LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold, merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD - HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR! Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace. Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...

S: 7A INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 7A
N: PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on COMPUTERS. GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 4.
S: 7B EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 7B
N: Lorenz and the Black Clad arrive at the doors. They RAISE THEIR MASKS and...
S: INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK
N: Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER... AT THE FRONT DOORS-- The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move into position. Lorenz stands center stage. Gun in hand, he aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!
C: LOREN
D: Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden moves! You! Hands on heads, drop to your knees. Now! Do it!
E: to the Tellers
N: PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED! Lorenz is in COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL. BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the counters! One on one side, one on the other. BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points them into the lobby! BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd level, forces them downstairs. From the corner of Lorenz's eye... The SECURITY GUARD's hand creeps toward his gun.
C: LORENZ
D: That... you don't want to do.
N: The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out. Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to Black Clad #2!
C: LORENZ
D: Y'all picked the wrong day not to use the ATM. You will not be harmed if you do exactly what I say, when I say it. You
E: Beat MORE
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 5. LORENZ (cont'd) take your chances if you choose not to listen. BLACK CLAD #2, keys in hand, flies across the counter, carrying a large duffel bag... Heading to the vaults!
C: LORENZ
D: No one will say I didn't give you a choice.

S: INT. THE LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK
N: Lorenz gets the message, finds THE BANK MANAGER cowering behind his desk.
C: LORENZ
D: You, up. You understood what I just said?
E: the Bank Manager obeys
C: BANK MANAGER
D: Yes.
C: LORENZ
D: Your security system, you can electronically lock all entrances...
C: BANK MANAGER
D: Yes. Right-right away.
C: LORENZ
D: With that attitude, you and I are going to get along famously. Now go.
N: The Bank Manager nods nervously. BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.
S: 10A INT. BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE 10A
N: The Bank Manager taps on his computer keyboard.
C: BANK MANAGER
D: It's done. We're locked down.

N: BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around.
S: INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY
N: Jenkins fastens his cufflinks. In the bed behind him... HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around her.
C: JENKINS
D: Have you seen my watch?
N: Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't love, this is a relationship of convenience. Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one last check in the mirror...
C: JENKINS
D: This was fun. You should get out of bed. You'll be late for work.
N: And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to close, then collapses back onto the bed.
S: INT. SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK
N: PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies the detonation device and... BLACK CLAD #2 (into his headset) Fire in the hole. He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM! AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE VAULT!
S: INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK
N: A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected. BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS-- An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment. He reaches up and PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON! SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 7. BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS profusely from his neck, not dead yet. Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.
C: LORENZ
D: What do you think you're doing?
N: BLACK CLAD #4 Fucker pushed the alarm. Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.
C: LORENZ
D: It would've made more sense to shoot him before he pushes the fucking alarm. Not after. Jesus.
E: looks at the Eager Teller
N: Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's head and...
C: LORENZ
D: And... If you're going to do something. Do it right.
E: FIRES his weapon!
N: The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead. Lorenz checks his watch... 9:26 a.m.
C: LORENZ
D: Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock. Get these people out of the way.
E: into microphone to Black Clad #4
S: A14 EXT. MOTEL - DAY - ESTABLISHING A14
N: The Four Seasons it ain't.
S: INT. SHOWER/ MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
N: There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off screen, chimes!
S: INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY
N: Teddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager. The number: 911. She picks up the TELEPHONE, dials. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 8.
C: TEDDY
D: This is Detective Galloway.
E: beat, then
S: EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY
N: SIRENS BLARE... POLICE CARS brake hard, blocking traffic. OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out! HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things... DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow him.
C: CALLO
D: I want all points of entry identified and covered. We need SWAT here now. Have emergency crews standing by!
E: into his radio
C: OFFICER AT BANK
D: Didn't take them long.
E: re: the Media
C: CALLO
D: Set a perimeter. Move'em back.
C: OFFICER AT BANK
D: How far?
C: CALLO
D: Portland.
S: A17 INT. SMALL OFFICE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY A17
N: A phone cord is YANKED from the wall! Black Clad #1 and #4 push Customers and Employees inside! They door SLAMS SHUT.
S: INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - AMERICAN NATIONAL - DAY
N: POV OF LORENZ - Callo approaches the Tech Van. Lorenz peeks through the curtains. A phone pressed between his shoulder and ear. He places a VOICE MODULATOR over the phone's mouthpiece (this will leave his voice sounding LIFELESS and DISTORTED to those on the receiving end).
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 9.
S: EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY
N: Callo arrives at the POLICE TECH VAN. So state-of-the-art NASA is green with envy. BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on, hands Callo a phone. Several other OFFICERS listen in.
C: DAX
D: We have them on the line.
N: Dax presses a series of buttons.
C: DAX
D: We're hot.
C: CALLO
D: This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D. Who am I speaking with?
E: into phone
C: LORENZ
D: No questions. It's time to set the rules. I am in complete control of this facility. No one gets in or out without my say and I will execute every last man, woman and child in here if my needs are not met. Do not test me. Today, I am a man of zero patience.
C: CALLO
D: I'm listening.
C: LORENZ
D: See if you can't screw this up, Detective... I have but one demand. One and only demand.
N: OMIT (COMBINED INTO SC. 17/18)
S: INT. CONNERS APARTMENT - DAY
N: Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his deck. Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a long beat...
C: CONNERS
D: Do you have a warrant?
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 10.
C: JENKINS
D: I need to speak to you, Quentin.
C: CONNERS
D: There's where your shit out of luck because I don't need to speak to you.
C: JENKINS
D: It's important.
N: Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE STACKS AND STACKS OF BOOKS.
C: JENKINS
D: Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.
C: CONNERS
D: Huh? You don't look like much of a Detective.
C: DEKKER
D: Funny. I was going to say the same about you.
C: CONNERS
D: Charming.
C: JENKINS
D: Shane just transferred in from Tacoma. His father...
C: CONNERS
D: Save your breath. I really don't care.
N: Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE. The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION, retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has passed...
C: CONNERS
D: Why don't we can the chit-chat. Get to what's on your mind.
C: JENKINS
D: We've got a hostage situation, American National Bank. The sonsabitches said they wouldn't talk to anyone but you.
C: CONNERS
D: No shit?
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 11.
C: JENKINS
D: No shit. I need you to do this.
C: CONNERS
D: Why should I?
C: DEKKER
D: Because people's lives are at stake. That takes priority over your ego.
C: CONNERS
D: You may want to put a leash on him. Saying I did want to help... I'm still suspended or did that slip your mind?
E: to Jenkins; re: Dekker beat; thinks
C: JENKINS
D: The commissioner's office has ordered me to reinstate you. As of now, you're back on the force.
C: CONNERS
D: Just like that?
C: JENKINS
D: Just like that. I won't, however, unleash you alone.
E: beat
C: CONNERS
D: Always a catch.
C: JENKINS
D: Shane, here, is your new partner. Consider him a younger version of me, looking over your shoulder, watching every move you make.
N: The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.
C: JENKINS
D: Don't think I endorse this. If it were my call, you'd be with your partner...
C: CONNERS
D: You mean ex-partner.
C: JENKINS
D: ... On the unemployment line with him.
C: CONNERS
D: For a moment there, I thought you cared.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 12.
C: JENKINS
D: I care about those innocent people down there. I hope to God someone hasn't made a monumental mistake letting you back in.
C: CONNERS
D: I appreciate the words of encouragement and the confidence you have in me. I look forward to the continuing, positive relationship we've shared in the past.
N: OMIT (COMBINED INTO SC. 20) OMIT OMIT OMIT OMIT
S: EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 10:27 AM - DAY
N: POLICE CORRAL the ever-growing group of SPECTATORS. A SWAT TRUCK pulls up, the BACK DOORS FLY OPEN! SWAT exit in a flurry, race into position. Amidst the commotion... JENKINS' CAR navigates the scene, stops next to... KAREN CROSS immediately recognizes Conners, orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him. Conners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head towards the crime scene, when...
C: KAREN CROSS
D: Detective Conners? Detective, can we have a few words?
N: Conners turns, recognizes Karen. Relishing the moment...
C: CONNERS
D: I'll give you two... Blow me. If you need a follow-up comment let me know? Cunt made her career off me.
E: pauses for effect to Dekker
N: AT THE POLICE TECH VAN-- SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 13. Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop. Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.
C: CONNERS
D: Teddy, Vincent... ... Nice to see you both.
E: completely ignores Callo
C: JENKINS
D: Conners has been reinstated to full active duty. It's his scene.
N: This info comes as a surprise. Especially to Callo.
C: CALLO
D: The last hostage situation this guy headed, an innocent civilian died.
C: CONNERS
D: I was not responsible...
C: CALLO
D: You never are. That girl would be alive today if it weren't for your cowboy antics. You destroy lives.
C: CONNERS
D: Fuck you. Look who's talking about destroying lives.
C: JENKINS
D: Decision's been made, Bernie.
C: CALLO
D: I was first on scene and I have seniority. Don't do this, Martin.
E: pleads
C: JENKINS
D: We'll talk about it later. Take a hike.
C: CALLO
D: Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from home.
E: beat
N: Callo exits.
C: CONNERS
D: I'm going to miss him.
E: sarcastic
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 14.
C: JENKINS
D: SWAT, because of the special circumstances will defer to Conners. He's in charge.
C: VINCENT
D: First time I've heard SWAT defer to anyone.
C: JENKINS
D: Second chances don't come around often. Don't blow it.
E: pulls aside Conners
N: Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away. He motions for Dekker to walk with him.
C: JENKINS
D: Anything questionable happens today, you let me know.
C: DEKKER
D: Yes, Captain.
N: Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.
C: TEDDY
D: Looks like you got yourself a baby- sitter.
N: Conners glares at Teddy out the corner of his eye, then dismisses the comment.
T: TIME CUT TO:
S: EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY
N: More SPECTATORS, more MEDIA. Conners, Dekker, Teddy and Vincent hover behind the first barricade. Conners unwraps gum, sticks it in his mouth.
C: VINCENT
D: We have approximately four to seven, heavily armed men holding an unspecified number of customers and employees hostage.
C: CONNERS
D: You're just a wealth of knowledge, aren't you?
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 15.
C: TEDDY
D: Witnesses heard shots fired and some kind of explosion. And their only demand has been to speak with you.
C: CONNERS
D: I'm sure it won't be the last. Get me a line into the bank. Let's see what they really want.
T: TIME CUT TO:
S: INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK
N: A PHONE RINGS... Lorenz enters, shuts the door and REMOVES HIS MASK. He lets a few rings pass, before ANSWERING.
C: LORENZ
D: Detective Conners?
E: into voice modulator
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY
N: Conners and company gather outside of the Police Tech Van. Dekker pulls a pad and a pen, prepares to take notes. Dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation.
C: CONNERS
D: Who am I speaking with?
C: LORENZ
D: For now... You can call me Lorenz.
N: Dekker writes, "Lorenz."
C: CONNERS
D: Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there? Can we get you anything? Food, medical supplies. We heard an explosion.
C: LORENZ
D: Everyone who matters is fine. Of course, I would've preferred not having the authorities involved at all. We weren't planning to be here this long. But, since Seattle's finest needs a presence on the scene, I'm glad it's you.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 16.
C: CONNERS
D: My fame proceeds me.
C: LORENZ
D: Don't be flattered. I needed someone who's been through the experience before. Hopefully this time it will go better for all involved. I plan on living a full, long and rich life. I didn't, however, expect them to find you so quickly. I thought you were suspended.
N: Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.
C: CONNERS
D: I was, but I'm back. You're information's old.
C: LORENZ
D: You never get what you pay for. You want to know about the hostages? How many and are they okay?
E: back to business
N: Dekker scribbles, "Pro".
C: CONNERS
D: Yes.
C: LORENZ
D: Approximately forty, they're fine, considering. All except one. We had a situation.
C: CONNERS
D: Someone's dead?
C: LORENZ
D: Theory... put to practice isn't always perfect. Can't expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may... randomly decide to revolt. Chaos... has some order to it. Detective? Are you still with me?
E: Conners drifts in thought
N: Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention. There's a new intensity to his demeanor.
C: CONNERS
D: What else will I be looking for?
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 17.
C: LORENZ
D: Demands... Probably too much to ask for you and your colleagues to pack up and go home?
C: CONNERS
D: Safe to say.
C: LORENZ
D: Stay by the phone. I'll contact you shortly.
C: CONNERS
D: Lorenz...
C: LORENZ
D: Don't worry, I have no plans until sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's going to be a long one.
C: CONNERS
D: Wait, we're talking here...
C: LORENZ
D: Patience, Detective. We don't want another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?
N: Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge. Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.
C: DAX
D: He's off.
S: EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY
N: THE CROWDS GROW. The MEDIA BUILD UP INTENSIFIES. THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... Karen Cross reports:
C: KAREN CROSS
D: This standoff is approaching two hours now. We've been told Detectives have made contact with the perpetrators inside the bank. Whether any specific demands have been made, we cannot confirm. As soon as we know something, we'll pass it on to you. Reporting live, Karen Cross, channel two news.
C: CAMERAMAN
D: We're clear.
E: OS
C: KAREN CROSS
D: Who the hell writes this shit?

S: 30A INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 30A
N: Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys, an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun. #1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear, repeats. POLICE TECH VAN-- The Detectives huddle. Impatience level high.
C: CONNERS
D: Try again.
E: to Dax
C: DAX
D: He's not picking up.
C: CONNERS
D: Try again.
E: stern
N: Dax, humbled, does as ordered.
C: CONNERS
D: Where's our fearless Captain?
E: glances about
C: DEKKER
D: Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.
C: CONNERS
D: So you're here in his place.
N: Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices.
C: CONNERS
D: Nicotine gum.
C: TEDDY
D: You quit smoking?
E: shock
C: CONNERS
D: Caffeine, too, if you must know. What? A man's capable of change.
E: Another shock
C: TEDDY
D: A man, yes. You... I'm not so sure.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 19.
C: CONNERS
D: Don't worry, I still have a vice or two.
C: DAX
D: Fifteen rings. No answer.
C: CONNERS
D: Try again in five.
C: TEDDY
D: What are they doing in there?
C: VINCENT
D: Wasting our time.
N: Time. The word rings in Conners's head. He starts to put it together.
C: CONNERS
D: Precisely. He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct. He's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before. He's heavily armed and well-connected. He knows he's surrounded. He hasn't asked for a damned thing. He drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait. He's buying time. Why?
C: VINCENT
D: To figure out his next move. He wasn't expecting us.
E: brainstorming
C: DEKKER
D: No, he wasn't expecting you. He said, he thought you were still suspended.
C: CONNERS
D: Probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me. Giving him the time he needs.
C: TEDDY
D: He's stalling.
C: DEKKER
D: He almost has what he came for.
N: Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 20.
C: CONNERS
D: Or... he's got what he came for and he's waiting for his ticket out of here. We're going in.
E: the decision
C: TEDDY
D: What?
C: CONNERS
D: The bank has three points of entry. Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team, head to the West side. We'll have the SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker, you're with me. Where is the SWAT Commander?
C: VINCENT
D: I'll find him.
N: Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.
C: TEDDY
D: That's a big call, Quentin. Thought about what you're doing?
E: to Conners; concern
C: CONNERS
D: You questioning me, Teddy?
C: TEDDY
D: Unfortunately... yeah.
C: CONNERS
D: I question how you can fuck that asshole and still manage to look in the mirror.
C: TEDDY
D: I'm not going to get into this now. And you're one to talk. I hear...
C: CONNERS
D: The hostages are in imminent danger. They've confessed to killing someone, an automatic murder one charge - that's a life sentence, maybe a needle for all of them. So why keep witnesses around to testify? Longer we wait, the greater the risk. We need to go in. Now.
E: interrupting
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 21.
C: TEDDY
D: Okay.
E: beat; then relents
N: Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a "Don't FUCK with me" attitude.
C: SWAT COMMANDER
D: I got snipers up top and ten soldiers on the ground.
C: CONNERS
D: What's the best way in?
C: SWAT COMMANDER
D: Tear gas, blow the doors...
C: CONNERS
D: Hold on. No explosives. I got forty civilians in there, too great a chance. Any other way?
C: SWAT COMMANDER
D: There's no pussy way in. The doors are locked electronically from the inside. We ain't getting in without force.
C: CONNERS
D: What if we cut the power? That will disable the system and we can open the locks manually, come in that way?
E: beat; thinks
C: SWAT COMMANDER
D: That'll work.
E: thinks; concedes
C: CONNERS
D: So we'll take the pussy way, Commander. We cut the power and go in at 11:15 sharp!

D: So we can't ID them.
C: DAX
D: There's a four minute, fifty-two second gap, before the image returns. But...
C: CONNERS

E: beat; thinks
C: DAX

E: MORE
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 32. AGENT DOYLE (cont'd) across the country. Along with this bank, he also had a box at Eastern Federal Savings in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was hit last month. Same M.O.
C: TEDDY

D: We don't keep records. The boxes are private. Since 9/11, we screen for live tissue, viruses or explosives, but if it passes those tests, we don't ask.
C: CONNERS
D: This is all real fascinating shit, but what about the money? Bank robbers still like cash, don't they?
C: BANK MANAGER
D: The cash drawers don't appear touched. Neither does the cash vault.
C: TEDDY
D: So they broke into a bank and didn't steal any money?
N: Odd glances all about.

N: Jenkins ignores Teddy.
C: CONNERS
D: You came to me. I didn't ask for this.
C: JENKINS
D: Commissioner's office is scrambling to cover their ass. They need a scapegoat... And I have zero problems serving you up.
C: CONNERS
D: You wanted this to happen.
C: JENKINS
D: No. But if it had to happen to somebody.
N: Jenkins exits.

D: What?
S: INT. DINER NEAR THE BANK - DAY
N: A grade "B" rating, tops. CUSTOMERS dine, choke down coffee. AT A BOOTH-- Empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. Conners finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. Dekker, all about work, goes over his notes. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 34.

C: CONNERS
D: Try that again?
E: confused
C: DEKKER
D: Pretty much... initial state of events may seem unrelated and random, but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together.
N: The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.
C: WAITRESS
D: Anything else, officers?

E: to Dekker
C: DEKKER
D: U Dub.
C: CONNERS
D: Not exactly Princeton, but not bad. How did you end up on the force?
C: DEKKER
D: It's kind of the family business.
C: CONNERS
D: Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's Dad and so on and so back?
N: Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.
C: DEKKER
D: Do we really need all this "get to know you" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't give a shit.
C: CONNERS
D: You've grown on me. Besides, I am entrusting my life to you. I should know something about you. I would
E: MORE
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 35. CONNERS (cont'd) think you'd like to know a little something about me.
C: DEKKER
D: I know about you, Detective. Everyone does.
C: CONNERS
D: You don't say that with much enthusiasm.
C: DEKKER
D: Not much to be enthusiastic about.
N: Conners reaches his limit. Time to put him in place.
C: CONNERS
D: Listen, my reputation often proceeds me. You, however, have no reputation; a fact I need to deal with. After you've been through the shit I have, then you can judge me. Now... we can try to work together, make the best of a bad situation or we can compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you. But since this is your first day here... today... mine's bigger.

D: No.
C: TEDDY
D: Excuse me.
N: Teddy exits.
C: DEKKER
D: Gina claims she doesn't know anything about a bank robbery.
C: CONNERS
D: Of course she doesn't. Vincent!
N: Vincent trudges out of the kitchen.
C: CONNERS
D: Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation one and turn the A/C on full. Leave her alone and cold. Let me know when her nipples can cut glass.
C: VINCENT
D: Will do. Detective... I didn't realize when we first met who you were. I worked with your father. It was only for a brief time when I first got outta the academy, but it was an honor.
E: To Dekker
C: CONNERS
D: Your father was Harry Dekker?
E: surprised
C: VINCENT
D: I wish it could've been for longer.
C: DEKKER
D: Thanks.
N: Vincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light. Dekker starts away, until... SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 44.
C: CONNERS
D: That was some fancy riding. You have a bike?
E: new subject
C: DEKKER
D: Used to, but I sold it. They're dangerous.
E: shows his scrape on his arm
N: MARNIE ROLLINS, 20's, a CSI OFFICER, wears gloves, pokes her head in the room.
C: MARNIE
D: Detectives. Ready for you.
N: THE BEDROOM-- TWO LARGE SUITCASES rest OPEN on the bed. Marnie prepares a report.
C: CONNERS
D: Somebody going on a trip?
C: MARNIE
D: Looks like it, don't it?
C: CONNERS
D: Marnie, you're looking well.
C: MARNIE
D: Heard you were back, Conners... and keep dreaming.
N: Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.
C: MARNIE
D: You, on the other hand... I gotta bike myself. Maybe we can go for a ride sometime? Or maybe I can just ride you.
E: to Dekker
N: Conners looks at both of them.
C: CONNERS
D: Can we get back to work?
C: MARNIE
D: We got passports, sun tan lotion, Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully hers and this...
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 45. She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.
C: DEKKER
D: Must be a fifty large there easy. His cut?
C: MARNIE
D: You'd think, right?
C: DEKKER
D: It's not?
C: MARNIE
D: Don't put words in my mouth, but... Two things jump out here. First, each bank branch has their own money bands. This is not American National's. After a little checking, it belongs to Pacific Savings of Seattle.
C: DEKKER
D: That sounds familiar.
C: MARNIE
D: It should. Four months ago, a half million dollars was stolen in an armed robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab job. They caught the guys a day later, recovering about $400,000. Those guys have been in lock up since and their trial's still pending. Which leads us to point number two. Do you smell that?
C: DEKKER
D: What is it?
E: smells the bills; grimaces
C: MARNIE
D: When evidence is taken in, any physical contact might affect the ability to lift prints, so, to mark it, we now spray a scented solution directly on the bill.
C: CONNERS
D: Is that new?
C: MARNIE
D: Wave of the future. Gotta keep up with the times, Conners.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 46.
C: DEKKER
D: So this money's not from our bank.
C: MARNIE
D: No. This is the money from the Pacific Savings job and our evidence room. Now... For a list of things you can put in my mouth.
E: smiling; to Dekker

D: I think it was Callo. Why?
C: CONNERS
D: No reason. Just thinking out loud.
N: I/E CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - DAY Conners and Dekker head back to the police station. It's quiet between these two, until...
C: CONNERS
D: When you said it was your "family business" I didn't think... I guess I just didn't connect the dots.
C: DEKKER
D: Don't worry about it.
C: CONNERS
D: Your father was a hero.
C: DEKKER
D: Yes he was.
C: CONNERS
D: At first I thought maybe you were related to the Captain.
C: DEKKER
D: No. No relation.

S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT
N: A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL. Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT. Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in the corner, observing.
C: CONNERS
D: We found the money.
C: GINA
D: That money was Dwayne's...
C: CONNERS
D: That money came from our evidence room.
C: GINA
D: I told you. I don't know nothing about a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was into, I didn't know!
C: CONNERS
D: So, where were you going?
C: GINA
D: Vacation.
C: CONNERS
D: This isn't possession or solicitation, Gina. This is felony-murder one. You could get life.
C: GINA
D: Me!? I didn't do nothing!
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 48.
C: CONNERS
D: It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't do nothing" is a double negative, infers the positive. The grammar in this country sucks.
E: frustrated
C: GINA
D: Then I didn't do ANY-thing!
N: Conners takes a seat next to Gina. His EYES BURN through her.
C: CONNERS
D: This isn't going away. You want to walk out of here, you tell me something... now.
C: GINA
D: I swear I don't know. Now I'm done talking. I want a lawyer.
N: Dekker lowers his head. Disappointed.
C: CONNERS
D: You sure that's what you want?
C: GINA
D: Yeah.
C: CONNERS
D: Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll make. The first will be to the public defender's office. The second to children's services.
C: GINA
D: What?
N: Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears. Suddenly a scared and lonely girl.
C: CONNERS
D: It's simple... if you insist on a lawyer, I take your kids.
C: GINA
D: No.
C: CONNERS
D: Not like you cared about them anyway. You were ready to fly the coop with "Shit-for-brains."
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 49.
C: GINA
D: No. You can't do that.
C: CONNERS
D: I can and I will.
C: GINA
D: Don't.
C: CONNERS
D: Tell me what I want to know!
N: Dekker stares incredulously at Conners.
C: GINA
D: I don't know anything. Please don't take my kids. Please.
E: broken
N: Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth. Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders.

N: Dekker and Conners...
C: DEKKER
D: You believe her?
C: CONNERS
D: I think for the first time in that girl's life she's telling the truth.
C: DEKKER
D: You had to know, once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us would have been inadmissable.
C: CONNERS
D: Who would've known? It would've been my word against hers. Who do you think the jury would've believed?
C: DEKKER
D: Justice by any means. Even if you cross the line.

S: INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT
N: Occupies almost the entire basement of the police station. A STEEL CAGE protects the contents. AT THE FRONT COUNTER-- Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present. Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone. Dekker RINGS the service bell. Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners.
C: CONNERS
D: Buzz us in.
E: cold
C: HARRY
D: You gotta sign first.
E: colder
N: Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.
C: HARRY
D: I heard you were back. Kinda liked not having you around, Conners.
N: Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied. Then reluctantly BUZZES them in.
C: CONNERS
D: Have another donut, Frankie.
N: Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number.

D: Like I said... No one takes anything out of here, unless they sign for it.

C: HARRY
D: He must've.
C: CONNERS
D: You don't remember?

D: The money from Richards's place traced back to the Pacific Savings heist a few months ago, a case Callo headed up.
C: TEDDY
D: Callo signed the money out of evidence two weeks ago.
C: JENKINS
D: How much?
C: TEDDY
D: $433,000.
C: VINCENT
D: If it's Callo, it would explain how they knew police protocol and how our department operates.
C: TEDDY
D: Also explains why he was so pissed this morning about being replaced by Conners. He wanted to be the point so everything went according to plan.
C: CONNERS
D: He doesn't need another reason to be pissed at me.
C: JENKINS
D: What about motive? Do we have one?
C: VINCENT
D: Pressure might've been getting to him. He's been getting the cold shoulder from cops since he testified about Pearl Street Bridge.
C: JENKINS
D: No. Don't buy that.
C: TEDDY
D: He was also getting divorced.
E: beat
N: This is news to everyone. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 53.
C: TEDDY
D: About a month ago, he told me he and his wife might be splitting. Asked if I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him out. I didn't think it was this bad.
C: JENKINS
D: Bernie Callo is a first rate cop. A boy scout. This doesn't make any sense.
E: conflicted
C: CONNERS
D: They never do, Captain.
C: JENKINS
D: Don't act like you're not enjoying this, Conners. I know what you think of him.
C: CONNERS
D: Doesn't matter what I think. Facts here speak for themselves.
C: DEKKER
D: No they don't. We haven't asked the question... Why, if Callo's involved, don't they ask for him at the bank? They asked for you.

N: The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED by COP CARS.
S: INT. BERNIE CALLO'S HOME
N: A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS. CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle her. In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD, a bullet wound right between the eyes. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 54. SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...
C: OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE
D: Wife came home approximately forty-five minutes ago. Found him here. None of the neighbors heard anything. There's no forced entry and no one saw anyone fleeing the scene.
N: Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.
C: VINCENT
D: Blueprints from the bank, schematics, pictures... Also, about a dozen internet articles on the Saudi Prince. Found it behind the furnace.
N: Conners nods.
C: DEKKER
D: Well, that's it, right?
N: Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS UP...

S: EXT. BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - DAY
N: Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...
C: CONNERS
D: What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with.
C: DEKKER
D: You'd think a cop would be smarter.
C: CONNERS
D: As cops we come across every temptation in the book. Money, drugs, power. We'd all like to think we can resist any urge, but... We're not saints.
C: DEKKER
D: So, Callo was involved and now they're dragging you into it. Why?
C: CONNERS
D: Man said he wanted vengeance.
C: DEKKER
D: Piss anyone off lately?
C: CONNERS
D: Me?
N: Both can't help but smile. Jenkins walks up.
C: JENKINS
D: I just got off the phone with Agent Doyle. After the Charlotte break in, the Prince withdrew all his possessions from every safe deposit box in this country.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 56.
C: DEKKER
D: Let me get this straight, they didn't touch the cash or the safe deposit boxes. So, they... break into a bank, blow it up, and steal nothing? Still make sense to you?
E: to Conners
C: CONNERS
D: Nothing about today makes sense.
N: Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home. Dekker's mind works overtime, then...

C: DAX
D: See what?

D: Go back a little.
C: CONNERS
D: What?

D: Notice the camera angles, they're all fixed. They don't rotate or pan.
N: Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...
C: DEKKER
D: There. Stop. Play it. Look closely, camera five, the vault cam, dominates our attention because of the explosion. But while that's happening, check out Camera two, customer service.
N: ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad. Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE SECURITY CAMERA.
C: DAX
D: Where'd he go?
N: ON SCREEN... As the EXPLOSION GOES OFF, CAMERA #2 PANS AWAY FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SECTION, TOWARDS THE LOBBY. SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 58.
C: CONNERS
D: He moved it. Changed the angle. He didn't want us to see something.
C: DEKKER
D: What's in that corner they didn't want us to see?
N: Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.
S: INT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK
N: AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's, carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints. Dekker and Conners look on.
C: DEKKER
D: Are you at all concerned that there's some whacko out there looking to get you?
C: CONNERS
D: If I worried about every threat made against me, I'd never leave the house.
N: The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS APPEAR ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD! Conners looks to Dekker, impressed.

C: CONNERS
D: No, four. More are coming.

N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 60.
C: ITALIAN HOST
D: It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best table in house. Now relax, I bring you food.
N: LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT-- A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy. PATRONS sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry. AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE-- Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day. Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the Detectives, admires in their closeness.
C: CONNERS
D: Shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about "returning to the beginning path" or something?
C: DEKKER
D: It's a Buddhist story.
C: CONNERS
D: We're all ears.
C: DEKKER
D: One day the Buddha found his heart in turmoil. So he retreats to the forest, to the earth, to the base of a great tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this elephant comes up and tells Buddha he doesn't like seeing him discouraged.
C: TEDDY
D: He can talk to an elephant?
C: DEKKER
D: He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th level of consciousness. He's capable of communicating with plants, trees... even rocks.
C: VINCENT
D: Rocks?
C: DEKKER
D: You asked.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 61.
C: CONNERS
D: Continue.
C: DEKKER
D: The Buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from, the beginning, to find the path, the answer. So when you hit a dead end, go back to the beginning to find your way. Or something like that.
C: CONNERS
D: We have a genuine philosopher in our midst.
C: VINCENT
D: You're a Buddhist?
C: DEKKER
D: No. Just something I picked up along the way.
C: TEDDY
D: But you're religious?
C: DEKKER
D: Not particularly.
N: Conners stares curiously at his new partner. Then excuses himself to go to the men's room.
C: DEKKER
D: You're all pretty tight.
C: TEDDY
D: We've been through a lot together.
C: DEKKER
D: I guess I just thought... I don't know. With all the trouble he's been in lately, coming back from suspension, everyone would treat him differently.
C: VINCENT
D: You can't believe what you read or see on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners is stronger. He's one of the best. Even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked, he was in control. That doesn't just happen. He's just that good.
C: TEDDY
D: Excuse me.

C: CONNERS
D: Prick used to work for some big-time software company until they caught him dipping into the company's slush fund. They didn't want the publicity so they didn't press charges. Couple years later, he was busted for looting the pension plans of retired cops. For a genius... he's a fucking moron.
C: DEKKER
D: This was your case. You and York. You made the bust. Why didn't it stick?
C: CONNERS
D: His lawyer put us on trial. Said we were crooked, abusive, that we planted evidence... We were in the midst of the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury bought it. They let him walk and we were the scapegoats.
C: DEKKER
D: Was it true?
C: CONNERS
D: The guy was guilty. He was scum. That was the truth. There's something they don't teach you. The system breaks down. You have to compensate to get results.

D: Meaning?
C: DAX
D: We've just witnessed the largest heist in history. Somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars.
C: DEKKER
D: Come again?
C: DAX
D: It's a computer virus. "The Computer Virus." It randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys' account. If you check the transactions, no two withdrawal amounts are the same and none of'em are over $100. Most security systems work on the size of the money, not number of transactions. Wire out one million from a handful of accounts and red flags go up. Wire out a less than a hundred from ten million accounts, no flags.

D: Where's the money now?
C: DAX
D: I tried following one of the transactions. It took me an hour and when I finally had it... It went away.

C: DAX
D: Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from any bank doesn't usually go into affect until the next business day. So it's going to keep jumping around until it clears at 9 AM tomorrow.
