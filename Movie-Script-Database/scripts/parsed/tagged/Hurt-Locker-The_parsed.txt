T: CUT TO:
S: EXT STREET/DAWN
N: A grainy, low-resolution view, seen from sixteen inches above street level. And we're moving fast -- nauseatingly fast. From this angle close to the ground we FLY down a road strewn with war garbage: munitions, trash, rubber, animal shit -- all of which, from this odd, jarring perspective, looks gigantic, monstrous. We zoom towards a crumpled COKE CAN, the white `C' growing enormous on the screen, filling the screen like a skyscraper. We SMASH into the can and barrel ahead. A RAG flutters, blocks the view, then tumbles away, as we -- -- zoom downhill, see nothing but gray sand, then zoom back up hill and off, catching air, a flash of the horizon line, BRIGHT SUN, and land hard on a packed road. We close in on one particular pile of trash, which is topped with a white plastic garbage bag, and stop. Puffs of dust and fluttering plastic. We glide across the fluttering plastic. Flies buzzing. Advancing slowly, inch by inch, to the edge for our first glimpse inside the bag: A RUSTY ARTILLERY SHELL.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT MIDDLE EASTERN STREET/DAWN
N: A military ROBOT (about 3 feet long and 2 feet high, aka `the bot') that rolls on tank-like treads and has a mechanical hand and an array of CAMERAS is moving around the bag. TITLE OVER: BAGHDAD, IRAQ - JANUARY, 2005 This is all taking place on a dusty stretch of road in a quiet section of Baghdad, barren except for a few shops, some cement houses and a couple of parked cars. THE U.S. MILITARY HAS CONTROL OF THE CITY, BUT INSURGENT GROUPS ARE MOUNTING FRESH ATTACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS ON 31 JANUARY 2005. THEY'VE ADOPTED A DEADLY NEW TACTIC, USING I.E.D.s - IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES - TO AMBUSH AMERICAN TROOPS. THE BODY COUNT IS RISING. IN RESPONSE, THE ARMY HAS DEPLOYED THE LAST OF ITS ELITE BOMB SQUAD UNITS, HOPING THAT THESE THREE MAN TEAMS CAN DISARM THE BOMBS BEFORE THEY EXPLODE, AND STEM THE TIDE OF DESTRUCTION. SOUND of far off GUNSHOTS and CALL to prayer. SEVERAL U.S. INFANTRY SOLDIERS are moving PEDESTRIANS away from the bag. Another group of SOLDIERS is clearing out all the shops: bakery, sandwich shop, and a butcher shop. Next to a parked Humvee, THREE EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal, aka Bomb Squad) SOLDIERS are crouched over a laptop computer, looking at the screen and the same image of the metal artillery shell inside the fluttering plastic. SERGEANT MATT THOMPSON wipes at the sweat on his forehead. This is summer in the desert and the median temperature on this bright clear morning is 110 degrees.
C: THOMPSON
D: It's to the left.
N: Thompson tears open a mushy Snicker's. He is fleshy around the arms and middle, but there's real muscle underneath the flab and truth be told, after so many years in EOD, he's lost the need to have a show-off build.
C: SANBORN
D: Going left.
N: SERGEANT J. T. SANBORN works the joystick on the laptop. He is a strapping Iowa farm boy, with a thick back from bailing hay. In contrast to his bulky frame, his face is soft, open, kind. He has a relaxed demeanor. Which might lead you to think nothing ever bothers Sanborn. But if you thought that, you'd be mistaken. Before joining EOD, Sanborn was in Military Intelligence. He quit. Military Intel was too easy.
C: THOMPSON
D: Up a little.
N: LAPTOP SCREEN Rusty artillery shell now almost full frame. SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: There?
C: THOMPSON
D: Closer. I want to see the ojive.
N: Zoom on the nose cone of the shell. The third soldier leans in for a better look. SPECIALIST OWEN ELDRIDGE is a tall, lanky young man, the youngest of the group. He's a fighter like the others but also a reader, and something of a thinker. Eldridge crouches behind the other two soldiers, sipping a bottle of water, eyes never leaving the screen.
C: THOMPSON
D: Push it in.
C: SANBORN
D: I can't get it inside.
C: THOMPSON
D: Pretend it's your dick.
C: SANBORN
D: I'm pretending it's your dick.
E: SMILES
N: Eldridge laughs. He clearly likes the two men he's with.
C: THOMPSON
D: Let me try.
C: SANBORN
D: Give me a second.
C: THOMPSON
D: Give me a crack at it.
C: SANBORN
D: Shit. Okay.
N: They change places. Thompson now on the controls.
C: THOMPSON
D: Hello mamma. See that?
C: SANBORN
D: Looks like a one-five-five.
N: Eldridge gets up and goes to the Humvee, fishes around inside.
C: THOMPSON
D: Yeah. That can do some damage.
C: SANBORN
D: We're going to need a charge.
N: Eldridge is already on it, approaching with the four blocks of C4. He's done this enough to know what they need.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Figured four blocks. Hey with these four blocks and the ninety pounds, are we going to be far enough away?
N: Now we see the tiny toy robot in the far distance -- far, far away. Behind the Humvee and on either side of the road INFANTRY SOLDIERS are still clearing civilian onlookers from nearby stores. Thompson stands and takes a good look at his surroundings.
C: THOMPSON
D: The blast is going to roll out there the shell will probably kick out there , and most of the shrapnel is going to rain up in an umbrella pattern. Some smaller pieces and shell fragments will come out this way -- but we'll be okay if we are behind the truck.
E: pointing pointing
N: The idea that he would be standing in the open amuses Eldridge.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You know I'll be behind the truck.
C: THOMPSON
D: Nothing wrong with that, Owen. Let's get the area cleared-- (looks around at the crowd
C: OF ONLOOKERS)
D: --as best we can, then load up the bot.
N: Eldridge double times it over to a nearby soldier. Together they herd away various bystanders.
T: CUT TO:
N: DOWNRANGE The bot dutifully makes its return voyage to the plastic bag, this time towing a cart which is loaded with C4 and a blasting cap, and a coil of unspooling detonation wire. The robot hits a bump causing the blasting cap to tumble to the ground, where it begins to roll -- UPRANGE Everyone cringes. The cap doesn't explode. Close call.
C: SANBORN
D: Damn.
N: DOWNRANGE The blasting cap has rolled into a gully, out of reach of the robot hand. UPRANGE Sanborn wiggles the stick. It's not happening.
C: SANBORN
D: Matt, the bot's not going to do it.
C: THOMPSON
D: Keep trying.
N: DOWNRANGE The robot hand tries again. No dice. UPRANGE
C: THOMPSON
D: Okay, you're right. I have to go down there - don't you think?
N: Sanborn nods.
C: THOMPSON
D: I don't want to wait around here in this neighborhood anyway.
C: SANBORN
D: What, you don't like it here?
E: WRYLY
C: THOMPSON
D: Let's just get me dressed.
T: CUT TO:
N: HUMVEE Sanborn unpacks "THE SUIT." A bizarre contraption that looks like an astronaut suit and helmet crossed with the Michelin Man. Because of its weight and complexity it takes two men to put it on - or one Sanborn. Sanborn kneels down and guides Thompson's feet into the suit's black boots, then lashes up a series of Velcro straps to secure the armor, like a squire working on a knight. A strap near the crotch prompts Thompson to wisecrack:
C: THOMPSON
D: Watch it.
C: SANBORN
D: I thought you already had your children, Sergeant.
E: SMILING
C: THOMPSON
D: Need to keep my options open.
N: Thompson twists to get his chest protector on. Eyes tight, brow furrowed, squints into the far distance. That's going to be a mean motherfucker.
C: THOMPSON
D: Okay. I'm going to make my approach. This area looks okay. No power-lines. Clean line of sight. If it looks alright when I get down there, I'm going to plug it in and we'll just blow it. Boom -- no more bomb -- give these people something to think about.
E: MORE
C: THOMPSON
D: I want them to know if they're going to leave a bomb on the side of the road for us, we're going to blow up their little road. Leave them a crater and an ear ache.
E: CONT'D
N: Sanborn and Thompson put in their earplugs.
C: SANBORN
D: Ready?
N: Thompson nods.
C: THOMPSON
D: I'm craving a hamburger, is that strange?
N: Next, Sanborn takes a metal helmet with a thick glass front and seals Thompson's face in. Sanborn attaches the breathing hose. Taps his boss on the shoulder.
C: SANBORN
D: Not for you. Happy trails.
E: sealing him in
C: THOMPSON
D: This is Blaster One.
E: HEADSET
C: SANBORN
D: Copy, that. Blaster One. You're good to go.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: Thompson turns to face the white bag and begins his walk toward it.
S: EXT. ROAD DAY
N: Thompson's stride is slowed by the eighty-pound suit...He CLUNKS down the road. Dust clouding from his boots... He moves past the same mounds of charred and rotting stuff, inner tubes, soda bottles, crumpled cans, steaming animal waste, and bits of fluttering plastic that the bot passed... The question is not - do you see a white garbage bag? It's which of these bags is the BOMB? Sweat slides down into his eyes.
C: THOMPSON
D: 200 meters. It's boiling in here.
E: HEADSET
N: UPRANGE
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that. 200 meters.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: The RASP of Thompson's BREATHING loud on Sanborn's walkie- talkie... DOWNRANGE Thompson walks on. A knot of flies floats in the air in front of his helmet. He lifts an arm and they disappear. The desert sun glints off a nearby car and momentarily bleaches his mask bright white. A YOUNG GIRL with an INFANT BABY in her arms appears in a far off doorway, then withdraws out of sight. He looks down, CAREFULLY watches his footfalls. Garbage piled on top of garbage. UPRANGE Eldridge and Sanborn are at the ready, scanning the area and watching Thompson.
C: THOMPSON
D: One hundred.
E: 0.S OVER WALKIE
C: SANBORN
D: Copy, that. 100 meters out.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: DOWNRANGE Thompson: careful footfalls on sand. Breathing. Heat. Sun. Sweat. Flies. Suddenly a DOG out of nowhere charges, BARKING ferociously. Thompson is momentarily startled. Then resumes his walking. The dog runs off. Thompson blinks more sweat out of his eyes.
C: THOMPSON
D: Twenty five.
E: HEADSET
N: UPRANGE WITH SANBORN Sanborn lifts the walkie. Sweat in his eyes. Wipes it away.
C: SANBORN
D: Copy twenty five. You're in the kill zone.
C: THOMPSON
D: Thanks for reminding me.
E: HEADSET
N: Eldridge nods. Everything progressing nice and easy. DOWNRANGE WITH THOMPSON Thompson is standing over the blasting cap.
C: THOMPSON
D: Alright. I'm here. I'm gonna put it in.
E: HEADSET
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that.
E: OVER WALKIE
N: Thompson picks the blasting cap off the ground and looks up -- As distant THUMP of approaching chopper wash quickly becomes super loud in his ears.
C: SANBORN
D: Hold on. Bird coming in.
E: OVER WALKIE
C: THOMPSON
D: I hear it.
E: HEADSET
N: Thompson pulls the cap back out. He looks up to see the giant black shape passing over him. [Note: we see now what Thompson is worried about: as it chops the air, a helicopter rotor produces static electricity. We see this electricity as a faint, nearly transparent rippling wave.]
C: THOMPSON
D: Guy is trying to kill me.
E: HEADSET
N: The helicopter turns, and swings back around.
C: THOMPSON
D: If he brings that electricity back here, I'm going to put a bullet in his tail.
E: HEADSET
N: The helicopter banks in the other direction, away from Thompson. UPRANGE A collective sigh of relief.
C: SANBORN
D: Jesus. I think he figured out we were EOD. You're good, Blaster One.
E: into walkie
N: DOWNRANGE Thompson inserts the cap back into the C4.
C: THOMPSON
D: We're armed and ready to blow, Blaster Mike.
E: HEADSET
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that. You coming back?
E: OVER WALKIE
C: THOMPSON
D: Copy that, I'm on my way.
E: HEADSET
N: Thompson gets up. Looks around at the expanse of empty, still road under heavy guard. The war has stopped for him -- and he knows it. Thompson begins to walk back uprange, looking carefully at the ground around him. UPRANGE Sanborn and Eldridge lower their rifles. DOWNRANGE Thompson carefully nudges a Coke can out of the way of his boots. UPRANGE Eldridge turns away from Thompson and opens the HUMVEE trunk to stow the bot. Sanborn swats a fly and takes a sip of water. Eldridge loads the bot. Out of the corner of his eye he sees some movement in the butcher shop.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Hey Sanborn --
C: SANBORN
D: Yeah?
E: TURNING
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Butcher shop - dude has a phone.
C: SANBORN
D: He shouldn't be --
N: Eldridge is already moving towards the store. Sanborn raises his gun and puts it on the store. The back of Eldridge moving in and out of his scope. He can't get a shot.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Hey - put that down--
E: shouting, waving his gun
N: The BUTCHER in a white apron nods and puts up his hand as if to say, `give me a minute.' THOMPSON --walking towards the Humvee away from the bomb. Lumbering steps.
C: THOMPSON
D: 50 meters. Why is Eldridge running?
E: HEADSET
N: ELDRIDGE --RUNNING HARD--
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Hey - put the phone down!
N: SANBORN --bolting sideways trying to get Eldridge out of his line of SIGHT--
C: SANBORN ELDRIDGE
D: PUT THE PHONE DOWN! Burn him!
E: shouting to Eldridge
N: ELDRIDGE --legs pumping, his thumb flicks the rifle safety-- The butcher smiles. Gives Eldridge the thumbs up sign. His other thumb is jamming a button on the phone. Now Eldridge is panicked, shouting:
C: ELDRIDGE
D: DROP THE PHONE!!!
N: THOMPSON --starts to run. Fear in his eyes. BUTCHER --smiles back at Eldridge-- MACRO: thumb on send button of the cell phone. THOMPSON --running full out now-- BOOM --- - Fireball blasts out from the bomb -- flattening Thompson -- Blood splatters the inside of his helmet. -- thick cloud of particulate matter roils out in slow motion -- hitting Eldridge and Sanborn -- turning them black. With the roiling cloud we begin to float up and out over the entire city of Baghdad: --we see intersections jammed with traffic; American Humvees and tanks idle next to red-and-white taxis, beat-up Opals, the military and civilian mixed up in one snarling line, all competing for space, advantage... --we continue to rise until we take in the entire massive metropolis. Mosques and office towers ascend from a maze of dusty streets teeming with life despite two decades of war... The roiling black cloud thins in a light breeze and we hard

S: INT CAMP VICTORY TRAILER DAY
N: A shaft of afternoon sun creeps past a plywood-covered window, faintly lighting the interior of a narrow, low- ceilinged room. In the dimness we see contours: desk, chair, a large locker, and the silhouette of a MAN moving a cot away from the window. On the cot is a small duffle bag. We hear a knock from the outside. The man moving the cot stops.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah.
C: SANBORN O.S.
D: Sergeant James?
C: JAMES
D: It's open.
N: The door opens and in the light we see Sanborn.
C: SANBORN
D: Sergeant James. J.T. Sanborn. Welcome to Bravo Company and welcome to Camp Victory.
E: extending his hand
C: JAMES
D: Victory? I thought this was called Camp Liberty.
C: SANBORN
D: They changed it last week. Victory sounds better.
E: SHRUGS
C: JAMES
D: It's Will. Good to meet you J.T.
N: SERGEANT WILLIAM JAMES extends a hand. A former DELTA soldier is in his late twenties, good-looking, appealing face, solid build, one of the lucky ones. And yet, look closer. In the right light, there's an unusual depth to his expression, to his eyes and all-American face, as if he's guarding an inner chaos that could rush out at any time. Right now, however, James is doing his best to act like a regular nice guy. Sanborn looks around the empty room. One duffle.
C: SANBORN
D: So, is that all you brought from Kabul?
N: James motions to the locker.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah. Here, give me a hand with this.
N: Sanborn helps James move the locker against the wall.
C: JAMES
D: By the window.
N: They push the locker over the window, blocking the light. It's very dark in the room now.
C: JAMES
D: A mortar once hit near my trailer -- boom -- a two inch piece of frag cut through the aluminum and flew this far over my head, past my balls and landed in my computer hard-drive. Where's the damn light?
E: gesturing with his hands
N: Sanborn finds the switch in the corner. Then he comes back and taps the metal locker, testing its strength.
C: SANBORN
D: This should stop any lateral pieces.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah, I'm good unless it comes through the roof in which case I'm gonna need a closed casket.
E: smiles
N: Sanborn doesn't like the joke, tries to change gears.
C: SANBORN
D: The accent -- you from Georgia?
C: JAMES
D: Tennessee. Trailer park off I-5.
C: SANBORN
D: Oh, right. I'm from Vermont. You know, "live free or die." Trees. Snow. Maple syrup. Pot.
N: James gives him a polite smile. Sanborn soldiers on:
C: SANBORN
D: Well, if you need anything to get squared away, just let me know. Either myself or Owen -- Eldridge -- be happy to steer you in the right direction for supplies, whatever.
C: JAMES
D: Okay. Thanks.
E: pause
C: SANBORN
D: Anyway, the mess tent can be hard to find the first time ... so ... if you want ... we're going over there now to grab chow ... come along.
C: JAMES
D: Thanks. But no.
C: SANBORN
D: You want me to bring you back a burger or something?
C: JAMES
D: Nah. I'm good.
E: shaking his head
N: James unzips his duffle and gets up to put his clothes on an overhead shelf. Sanborn watches him, then starts for the door. James turns to face Sanborn.
C: JAMES
D: I'm sorry about Thompson, I heard he was a good tech.
C: SANBORN
D: Yeah, he was. And he was a good team leader too.
C: JAMES
D: I know I can't fill his shoes, but I'm here to try--
C: SANBORN
D: Appreciate it.
C: JAMES
D: --but you know, if it's your time it's your time. No man can change that.
C: SANBORN
D: Yeah, I guess that's true. So, we roll at oh-six-hundred.
E: PUZZLED RECOVERING
N: James smiles slightly as he contemplates the next day's mission.
C: JAMES
D: Looking forward to it.
S: EXT TRAILER MOMENTS LATER
N: Sanborn comes out and sees Eldridge, who has been waiting by the door. They walk towards the mess tent. Sanborn is absorbed in thought. Eldridge doesn't want to interrupt. After a moment.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: So?
C: SANBORN
D: A good `ole boy. You know, loves the Army, blood runs green. Country boy. Seems solid.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I always liked southerners, for some reason.
C: SANBORN
D: Then he's just your type.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Why is it always the gay jokes with you. It's not even funny.
C: SANBORN
D: It's your time it's your time.
E: growing serious, he imitates James' accent
C: ELDRIDGE
D: He said that?
E: CONCERNED
N: Sanborn nods.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY ELDRIDGE'S TRAILER EARLY MORNING
N: The sand has completed its daily march across Eldridge's steps. His boots sweep a bit away as he steps outside in full battle gear, and kisses a photo of the Virgin Mary and slips it inside his helmet. He steps out into the bright morning sun.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY HUMVEE PARKING LOT
N: Sanborn is gearing up, strapping on a shitload of weapons and ammunition. Ready for anything. Eldridge comes up.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Where's the FNG?
N: [Note: FNG. Fucking New Guy.]
S: EXT JAMES' TRAILER
N: Eldridge, surprised to see James is not outside ready to go, knocks on his door. Beat.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah?
E: O.S.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: It's oh-six-hundred.
N: The door opens a crack, revealing James dressed in his skivvies and wrapped in a blanket, blinking awake.
C: JAMES
D: Gimme a minute.
N: Before Eldridge can express the shock that's written all over his face, James has closed the door.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY
N: An American Humvee drives past a long line of parked tanks arranged in a neat rows, and gathering dust on all horizontal surfaces.
S: INT HUMVEE
N: Sanborn is behind the wheel, simultaneously driving and loading his rifle. James sits next to him in the passenger seat, loading his rifle and looking out the window. Eldridge is in the back seat.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Those Abrams have been parked ever since I got here nine months ago, and I ain't seen them move once. They should put those on eBay. Hey, J.T., how much you think one of those would cost?
E: looking out window
C: SANBORN
D: Ten million?
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Well I guess it makes sense. Anybody comes alongside the Humvee, we're dead. Anybody looks at you funny, you're dead. Pretty much, the bottom line, is if you're in Iraq you're dead. How's a tank going to stop that?
C: SANBORN
D: Gimme a break, Owen.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Sorry. Just trying to scare the new guy.
E: SMILING
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY/BAGHDAD OUTSKIRTS MORNING
N: The Humvee moves out of the base and into the outskirts of the city. Heat and sand and little else.
S: INT HUMVEE
C: JAMES
D: We had a few bombs up in Kabul too.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Sure, I bet you did. But you're going to be real busy here, boss.
N: James smiles, settles back in the seat.
S: EXT HUMVEE
N: The Humvee is now approaching a cluster of cars.
S: INT HUMVEE
C: SANBORN
D: Hey Owen -- watch the fucking road.
N: Eldridge moves up to the gunner's seat on top of the Humvee.
S: EXT HUMVEE
N: Eldridge has a collection of rocks he keeps in the gunner's nest and now he throws one at the car in front of him. The passenger turns around.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Imshee -- Imshee !
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BAGHDAD STREET EARLY MORNING
N: The Humvee grinds to a stop on the outskirts of town. It's a place teeming with trash, with dwellings that look as beaten down as the people. The ghetto of the ghetto. James is first out, Sanborn comes up behind him. Eldridge climbs out of the turret. They are now out in the open -- standing on Iraqi sand -- where anything can happen.
C: SANBORN
D: Clear here.
E: TO ELDRIDGE
N: Eldridge nods and begins turning suspicious bits of plastic over with the tip of his boots.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Clear here.
C: JAMES
D: (looking around at the
C: EMPTY STREET)
D: Where are the guys who called this in?
N: James walks on. Sanborn and Eldridge exchange a glance `what the hell,' and follow him.
C: SANBORN
D: Victory Main, Victory Main, this is Blaster Mike. Interogative, Do you have an updated poz for the link- up? Has their position changed?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: After a moment a scratchy voice over his walkie.
C: DISPATCH O.S.
D: Blaster Mike, this is Victory Main. Negative. Figures to follow. Three- four-five-three is your grid. You should have a visual on them right now. They're waving an American FLAG
E: OVER WALKIE
N: Sanborn keys his GPSw unit.
C: SANBORN
D: Negative, Main. No one in sight.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: DISPATCH O.S.
D: Blaster Mike. You should have a visual, waving a flag.
E: OVER WALKIE
C: SANBORN
D: Well, that's were I am and I don't see any guys in fatigues, and I sure as hell don't see any American flag, Over.
E: INTO WALKIE looking at empty space
N: James, Sanborn and Eldridge continue their slow walk down the street. An empty Humvee comes into view.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: They abandoned their vehicle?
N: James walks forward. Unconcerned. Takes out a cigarette and lights it. Sanborn's walkie comes to life.
C: DISPATCH O.S.
D: Roger, Blaster. I copied you the first time.
E: OVER WALKIE
N: James approaches the empty Humvee. Stops. Turns to see a tiny American flag being waved in the window of a nearby building. James jogs over to the building, opens the door.
C: JAMES
D: Hello boys --
N: Looking into a room full of SOLDIERS who are trying not to look afraid.
C: SANBORN
D: Yeah, thanks. Roger that.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Don't tell me the bomb is in there with you.
E: TO SOLDIERS
N: A SERGEANT, slightly embarrassed, climbs out into the open and tries to act nonchalant. He points down the block, which is a sea of trash and white plastic bags.
C: SERGEANT
D: (pointing far down the
C: ROAD)
D: Down on that block, one of our informants says there is an IED in a white plastic bag.
N: James has heard enough and even though the Sergeant may have more to say --
C: JAMES
D: I'll get it. Break out the suit. ) Keep your guys back.
E: turning to Sanborn turning back to the SERGEANT
N: Sanborn is already unloading the robot.
C: SANBORN
D: What about the bot?
C: JAMES
D: Don't need it.
C: SANBORN
D: What? Aren't we going to send the bot down to take a look?
E: SURPRISED
C: JAMES
D: Nah, I'm going to take care of it.
N: Sanborn shoots Eldridge a look. Is he an FNG or what?
T: CUT TO:
N: JAMES Sanborn and Eldridge kneeling before James, buckling on the suit.
C: SANBORN
D: I was thinking if we sent the bot down first --
N: James ignores him. As soon as he's enclosed in the suit, James moves quickly toward the rubble pile. UPRANGE
C: ELDRIDGE
D: He's a rowdy boy.
C: SANBORN
D: He's reckless.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Somebody should tell the U.N. to send the rice in clear plastic bags so there's no place to hide the IEDs. The insurgent would be like, `Allah has forsaken me all the bags are clear'.
N: [Note: IED Improvised Explosive Device. A homemade bomb. The number one weapon of the Iraqi insurgency.]
C: SANBORN
D: I've seen so much garbage I'm starting to like the smell.
E: SMILING
N: JAMES As he advances downrange, he passes a line of bushes and tosses an incendiary grenade at it, setting the foliage ablaze. UPRANGE Sanborn looks on in confusion.
C: SANBORN
D: Blaster One, what are you doing?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: No answer.
C: SANBORN
D: Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike, what's with the fire on the side of the road, over?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: No answer. Sanborn and Eldridge struggle to get a visual. They dash to a better vantage point.
C: SANBORN
D: Hey James, can you hear me? What's with the fire on the side of the road, over?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: JAMES FINALLY:
C: JAMES
D: Creating a diversion.
E: OVER HEADSET
N: Sanborn can barely see James through the flames and smoke. UPRANGE He climbs up on top of the Humvee to get a better look but gets only a partial view.
C: SANBORN
D: From what? Is there a threat?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: Eldridge scans the area with his rifle, tense, trying to figure out how to behave.
C: SANBORN
D: Get up on that wall.
E: TO ELDRIDGE
N: Eldridge hustles over to the wall, but can't manage to pull himself up with all his gear on, so dashes down to a mound of dirt, which gives him a leg up.
C: SANBORN
D: James, I can't see you, over.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: The last thing he expects is James' laconic reply:
C: JAMES O.S.
D: Copy that.
E: OVER WALKIE
N: Sanborn shoots Eldridge a look - what the fuck.
C: SANBORN
D: Tell me what you see, Specialist.
E: TO ELDRIDGE
N: Eldridge, on the wall, feels awfully vulnerable and in the open. The wall is quite narrow. His feet are precariously balanced. His view of James is not much better
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I see his back. He's walking downrange. Oh, I lost him.
C: SANBORN
D: Eldridge, move down that wall and maintain a visual. Move. Move.
N: Eldridge teetering down the wall.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Roger, roger. I'm on him. He's still walking.
N: SOUND of BREATHING in Sanborn's walkie.
C: SANBORN
D: James, the smoke is killing my visibility. Where are you in relation to the IED? Are you 100 meters, yet?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: JAMES
C: JAMES
D: Hell, I don't know. I'll let you know when I'm standing over it.
E: HEADSET
N: We see the world from James' point of view now, the city of Baghdad has taken on an intense and dreamy hue, as if we're in some sort of fugue state: --He looks down the strange, threatening Iraqi street. He walks on. The suit is heavy, little puffs of sand with each footfall. The sun beats down. James nears an intersection guarded on either side by a Humvee and several SOLDIERS, when... INTERSECTION Suddenly a red-and-white TAXI swerves past the SOLDIERS on the left side of the intersection. The soldiers take cover and shout contradictory commands - Get Down Motherfucker! Don't Move! Back up! Out of the vehicle! The TAXI BRAKES in front of James. UPRANGE Sanborn and Eldridge can hear the shouting but the lingering smoke still obscures their sight.
C: SANBORN
D: JAMES --
E: INTO WALKIE
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Car! Car! A car stopped in front of him.
E: shouting to Sanborn
N: JAMES James' HEADSET WALKIE barks to life:
C: SANBORN O.S.
D: Come back.
E: HEADSET
N: James pulls a pistol from his holster, and --
C: JAMES
D: I got it.
E: HEADSET
N: -- shoots two rounds into the dirt, near the car's front tire. DRIVER'S FACE Impossible to read. Is he a taxi driver annoyed by the roadblock, or an insurgent fighter getting ready to blow a suicide bomb? ONE OF THE ARMY SOLDIERS With field glasses on the intersection he speaks into the walkie.
C: SOLDIER
D: EOD has a nine on this Haji in the car. I'm going to get two guys over there to back him up.
E: OVER WALKIE
N: SANBORN Still can't see clearly. Processing this information. Turns to Eldridge. Eldridge using his rifle scope as well - shakes his head. No visual.
C: SANBORN
D: Negative, negative. You're too close to the IED-- Stand down. EOD has the situation under control.
E: into walkie to soldier HESITATING
N: Sweat on his forehead. JAMES Now aiming at the windshield. But the driver is impassive. UPRANGE Eldridge looks through his rifle scope.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: We're in a kill zone!
E: shouting to Sanborn
N: INTERSECTION James fires, shattering the windshield. But the car doesn't budge. James is pissed. He lunges through the windshield and jams his gun into the driver's forehead. SOLDIER
C: SOLDIER
D: Three or four rounds fired. The nine is now pressing into the Haji's forehead.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: INTERSECTION The gun digs into the driver's forehead. Beat. The driver shifts into reverse. He rolls back to the soldiers, who then rush the car, yank the driver out, and deliver a savage beating as James looks on. JAMES
C: JAMES
D: (chuckling into his
C: HEADSET)
D: If he wasn't an insurgent he sure as hell is now.
N: And he resumes his walk towards the white garbage bag and the rubble pile, noting possible threats -- a MAN in a window down the road. UPRANGE
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that.
E: coolly, into walkie MORE
C: SANBORN
D: But I have no idea what you're talking about, Blaster One, since I can't see you. Over.
E: CONT'D
C: JAMES O.S.
D: I'll tell you later. James out.
E: HEADSET
N: PILE OF RUBBLE One of a million in this city. James draws near. Two wires protrude from the mess. Moving quickly, he deftly removes rubble and trash to expose the wires and the artillery shells they are attached to -- sees out of his peripheral vision the MAN in the window -- reaches for his pistol -- but the man disappears from view -- he then goes back to work, with swift sure hands. He loves this, loves being close to oblivion. The wires are exposed. He cuts one. Then flips the artillery rounds over and cuts the other wire.
C: JAMES
D: We're done.
E: HEADSET
N: He stands and uses his big boot to clear more rubble. A banana peel is pushed away, revealing: Another wire snaking out of the ground.
C: JAMES
D: Secondary!
E: HEADSET
N: James spins to look uprange. Sees Sanborn motioning for the men to get down. UPRANGE
C: SANBORN
D: Off the wall, Owen! Get behind something. Find cover.
E: TO ELDRIDGE TO SOLDIERS
N: Soldiers scrambling to find concrete to hide behind. JAMES James YANKS the wire out of the dirt but it turns out to be buried like a root, and the more he rips the more the wire is revealed. He rips and rips, going back ten feet. ---The wire is stuck in the ground, and it will not come out anymore. James digs with a knife -- FURIOUSLY moving earth -- until he reaches a third artillery shell, which he pulls out of the ground. --CU knife blade inside the shell -- --CU James' helmet - glass clouding over from condensation -- losing visibility. --ECU blasting cap -- --ECU knife tip separates the wire...
T: CUT TO:
N: UPRANGE MOMENTS LATER James strides uprange. Eldridge isn't sure what to make of James. Sanborn is, but not ready to show it.
C: JAMES
D: (gulping air as the helmet
C: IS REMOVED)
D: Did you see that guy? (smiles, recovers his
C: MACHO)
D: Man, I need a beer.
N: Sanborn begins the bomb suit removal ritual - unstrapping Velcro.
C: SANBORN
D: We can arrange that.
N: He yanks at the strap - a little roughly.
C: SANBORN
D: What do you like?
C: JAMES
D: Colt.
C: SANBORN
D: Nice southern brand.
N: Yanks at another strap. James looks down, the tone of Sanborn's voice and the force of the strap gets his attention. Eldridge picks up the pieces of the suit and places them into the Humvee. Listening to this exchange.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I'd take a beer.
C: JAMES
D: Hey, that wasn't too bad, for our first time working together.
E: SMILING
C: SANBORN
D: I think working together is I talk to you. And you talk to me.
C: JAMES
D: Are we going on a date, J.T.?
N: Sanborn stands, removing the last piece of the suit.
C: SANBORN
D: No, we're going on a mission. And it's my job to keep you safe, so we can keep going on missions.
C: JAMES
D: Hey, this is combat.
N: With that James walks to the Humvee and gets inside. Sanborn closes the trunk, hard, startling Eldridge. Eldridge comes close, speaking out of James' earshot.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: It's just thirty nine days.
C: SANBORN
D: Thirty eight. Assuming we survive today.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
S: INT HUMVEE
N: James is in the passenger seat, waiting impatiently. Sanborn and Eldridge get in.
C: JAMES
D: I don't mean to mix it up. But the situation dictated it.
C: SANBORN
D: Roger that.
E: COOLLY
C: JAMES
D: I'm serious. We're gonna work together. You'll get used to my ops tempo.
C: SANBORN
D: Your ops tempo?
C: JAMES
D: I don't always stop to chat, and I like to go fast. You know, so the insurgents don't have time to plan. I don't want them make any cell phone calls.
N: Off Sanborn's face.
S: INT. CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT DAY
N: Eldridge and Sanborn chowing down - two guys among a sea of SOLDIERS. Behind them in the mess tent hang the signs of various fast-food restaurants that cater to the troops: PIZZA HUT, SUBWAY, BURGER KING.
C: SANBORN
D: Ketchup?
N: Eldridge passes his ketchup over to Sanborn.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: This is not Pizza Hut. (removing a slice of
C: PEPPERONI)
D: And this is not pepperoni. It's round and meaty, but it ain't pepperoni.
C: SANBORN
D: Goat meat, probably.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Goat meat pepperoni? I'd be glad if this was goat meat pepperoni.
E: MORE
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I'd eat a truckload of goat meat pepperoni. No, this is something else. This is unholy.
E: CONT'D slapping the fake pepperoni on the table
C: SANBORN
D: Pray for something better -- and while you're at it, pray for a new team leader.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You sure you want to be the guy in the bomb suit?
N: They see James at a food station.
C: SANBORN
D: Be better than him.
N: James approaches the table.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Hey, James.
N: James sits down to an awkward silence. Eldridge stops eating. Considers him.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: That was some crazy shit you pulled out there.
E: TO JAMES
C: JAMES
D: Yeah?
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Hell yeah. You're either really lucky or really good. Right up on the car like that. Gun to the head. Crazy. You know it might backfire on you someday. You know that. You might actually die. And then what?
N: James is puzzled.
C: JAMES
D: I don't know, what?
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You don't meet your maker. You just get vaporized into little bits of DNA.
N: Sanborn watches Eldridge closely. Is he referring to Thompson?
C: SANBORN
D: He asks everyone what they think about death. Ever since Thompson was KIA.
E: trying to be helpful
N: James nods, turns to Eldridge:
C: JAMES
D: I don't think about it. Waste of time.
N: James goes back to eating. Eldridge keeps looking at him, then lets it go.
S: EXT. CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT DAY
N: Midday in Iraq. The heat is oppressive, biblical. James, Sanborn and Eldridge emerge into the blazing sun and the tumult of the base. Trucks barrel by. And troops -- everywhere, troops. James stops in front of young Iraqi KID selling pirated DVDs, while Sanborn and Eldridge continue on to the head shed. The kid, whose name is PELE, has DVDs fanned on a table.
C: PELE
D: One for five, two for nine.
C: JAMES
D: Three for twelve?
E: HAVING FUN
C: PELE
D: Three for thirteen. And for you, no tax.
C: JAMES
D: Keep the change.
E: laughing, fishes out a five
S: EXT HEAD SHED PORCH
N: Sanborn is smoking a cigarette and watching James buy DVDs, weighing him, when the team's FIRST SERGEANT, stocky with a paternal way about him, holds out a white envelope to Sanborn.
C: FIRST SERGEANT
D: The tags finally came. Figured you'd want to be the one to take them over.
E: handing Sanborn the ENVELOPE
C: SANBORN
D: Thanks, I will handle it.
N: The Sergeant nods. Sanborn stuffs the envelope in his back pocket. And the Sergeant heads inside, walking past --
S: INT HEAD SHED SIDE OFFICE
N: A small office space with the door opened a crack. Behind the door, Eldridge is sitting on a swivel chair, looking at a computer screen, playing a computer game. Next to him in another swivel chair is LT. COL. JOHN CAMBRIDGE, a MILITARY PSYCHIATRIST, who is looking at Eldridge and the screen.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: "Be all that you can be," right? But what if all I can be is dead on the side of an Iraqi road?
E: singing the jingle
C: LT. COL CAMBRIDGE
D: I'd like to see you move past this feeling that you're going to die, Owen.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Why? I think it's logical. This is a war, right Doc? People die all the time. Why not me?
E: looking at the screen
C: LT. COL CAMBRIDGE
D: That's true. But what concerns me is how much you think about it. You have to change the record in your head, think about other things.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What do you think about?
C: LT. COL CAMBRIDGE
D: I don't dwell on death. I don't obsess. You understand what I'm getting at?
E: looking at his watch
N: Eldridge looks up at last.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY JAMES' TRAILER NIGHT
N: James stands before the open door of his trailer with the satellite phone in hand. Overhead a canopy of stars blinks. Through the earpiece of the phone the faint but unmistakable BEEP of an answering machine.
C: JAMES
D: Hey, guess you're out...wherever you are you're probably wearing those tight jeans, damn those look good... Anyway, Baghdad's alright, guys are a little uptight down here, but then they just lost a brother so I understand... uh... ...really beautiful night, wish you could see these stars...miss you...bye...
E: INTO PHONE looking up at the stars
N: He disconnects. Sits in the darkness. Distant WASH of engine noise.
S: INT CAMP VICTORY SHOWER STALLS NEXT MORNING
N: Sanborn is shaving in a mirror, otherwise dressed for combat and ready to go, when James shuffles in wearing a T-shirt and boxer shorts, looking like he just woke up. Sanborn can't believe James is this relaxed.
C: SANBORN
D: Hey.
C: JAMES
D: Hey.
N: James starts to brush his teeth.
C: SANBORN
D: I gotta talk to you about something before we roll out.
N: James keeps brushing.
C: JAMES
D: Shoot.
C: SANBORN
D: Yesterday -- that was not cool.
C: JAMES
D: I know. We'll get it.
N: More tooth brushing. Face cleaning. James notices a tatoo on Sanborn's forearm.
C: SANBORN
D: I was in Military Intel for seven years. Before EOD. We ran combat missions in every shit hole on the
C: PLANET
D: So I'm pretty sure I can figure out a dumb trailer park redneck like you.
E: beat, smile on his face
C: JAMES
D: (spitting out water,
C: SMILES BACK)
D: Looks like you're on the right track.
S: INT HUMVEE SOMEWHERE IN BAGHDAD MORNING
N: Sanborn drives. James in the passenger seat. Eldridge is in the gunner's turret. They ride in silence, each man alone with his thoughts. TITLE OVER: DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 37
S: EXT ROAD BEHIND BRITISH EMBASSY DAY
N: A faded blue Opal sits by a high wall laced with concertina wire. It's at the end of a narrow cul de sac which backs onto the embassy. The narrow cul de sac dog-legs into another street. At the entrance to the cul de sac, there is a phalanx of SOLDIERS and our EOD techs. Sanborn and Eldridge are unloading the robot from the Humvee. Other soldiers are evacuating OFFICE WORKERS from the embassy. James seems frustrated with the situation - frowning into the face of the SERGEANT in charge.
C: SERGEANT
D: An office worker called it in. The car doesn't belong to anyone who works at the building. It's been parked there for an hour. No license plate and the suspension is sagging, so there's something heavy in the trunk -- three or four hundred pounds. Could be a bomb.
C: JAMES
D: Did you evacuate?
C: SERGEANT
D: We're trying. But the English Ambassador said we're supposed to guarantee his safety.
N: Sanborn approaches, lap top in hand.
C: SANBORN
D: Bot is ready.
S: EXT ROAD BEHIND EMBASSY
N: A WOMAN in a Bhurka on a motorcycle rides past the Soldiers and towards the Opal -- SOLDIER 1 (raising his rifle) Shit -- What do you want me to do? SOLDIER 2 Shoot her. SOLDIER 1 We can't shoot her for riding a bike... -- CU the motorcyclist's hands, holding a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. It's hidden from view of the soldiers. -- She rolls the cocktail under the car and darts down an ALLEY The car BURSTS into flames, and the scene breaks into -- PANDEMONIUM -- -- Eldridge frantically straps James into the suit, as the car burns. -- James takes off his sunglasses, cleans them, calmly. -- Sanborn runs to the truck and returns with a fire extinguisher, which he hands to James.
C: JAMES
D: Eldridge - I want you in that window - keep the alley clear. Sanborn, cover it from the street.
N: Sanborn looks at the alley: not a happy place. Eldridge takes off towards the Embassy entrance.
S: INT. AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE
N: AMBASSADOR SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES, the epitome of the old style of British foreign service: elegant, self assured, a gentleman adventurer in Seville Row, hoping to improve the world, certain he'll profit in the attempt. He's holding court with a group of EXECUTIVES. The executives are seated around a conference table under the Ambassador's sway. There's a model of a British Petroleum gas station/convenience store, in English and Arabic, in the center of the table.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: ...So in sixteen months time I believe five million gallons per day is in fact rather conservative.
N: SOUNDS out the window. An Executive turns his head nervously.
T: EXECUTIVE
N: But security is still the big variable? The Ambassador brushes his hand in dismissal.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Only on the margins. Everyday, the risks diminish and the rewards multiply--
E: SMILING
N: Eldridge enters.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Ah, and here is EOD. You see gentlemen, everything is fine. The site is secure. The bomb -- if there even is one -- will easily be dispensed by the crack American team.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Excuse me.
N: Eldridge rushes over to the window to see the street.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Blaster Mike, I'm at the window.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: SANBORN He's stationed himself near the mouth of the alley. Wisps of smoke and flames in the air.
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that. How's the fire look from up there.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Flames a meter high, over.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: JAMES Close to the burning car. SMOKE rising from the hood and the under carriage awash in FLAMES, like a sleeping dragon. James sprays the fire-extinguisher and the fire subsides. He inspects the interior - looks normal enough - and tries to open the trunk with a pair of pliers, but the handle doesn't give and snaps off under his effort. He kicks the trunk but it remains shut. He turns and lumbers up range, jaw set. SANBORN Watching James walk back uprange.
C: SANBORN
D: Blaster One, what is going on?
E: INTO WALKIE
C: JAMES O.S.
D: Stay put, I'll be right back.
E: HEADSET
N: Standing alone in the kill zone at the mouth of the alley.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What's happening?
E: OVER WALKIE
C: SANBORN
D: Good question. But I'm not liking it.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: HUMVEE James is buried inside the Humvee, searching. He tosses what he doesn't need, and a succession of items comes flying out -- food, clothing, a tarp. Now James walks back towards the Blue Opal without saying a word. In his hand is a crowbar. BLUE OPAL James winds up and swings hard at the door. Wham! Nope. Wham! Wham! Wham! He drops the crowbar and tries the trunk. Presto, it opens, revealing: a trunk overflowing with EXPLOSIVES -- ten times what we've seen before. James is taken aback.
C: JAMES
D: We're all in the kill zone on this one.
E: HEADSET
N: SANBORN Sanborn stares at James and the car. Great. JAMES Now inside the car, slipping on the slimy seats, he cuts the seat cushions with his knife, and rips out the foam upholstery, and finds more bad news buried underneath: SIX ARTILLERY SHELLS and a WIRE that leads to the floorboard and goes under the carpeting. James DIVES to the wire and cuts it, then rips open the carpet to reveal more wire -- and follows the wire through the car, ripping apart the car PIECE by PIECE, cutting wire as he goes. AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE An executive gets up to look out the window.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Sir, I'm going to need you to stay away from the window.
E: TO EXECUTIVE
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Yes, please, sit down. It's safe.
T: EXECUTIVE
N: Why is he here, if it's safe?
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: He is just an observer.
T: EXECUTIVE
N: (TO ELDRIDGE) Is that true, we're safe here?
C: ELDRIDGE
D: In my opinion, no.
E: DISTRACTED
N: Executives take this as a cue to leave. Getting up, shuffling out of the room. The Ambassador is furious at Eldridge, advancing on him.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: This is idiotic. Why not tow the vehicle away from the building?
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I believe the lane is too narrow for a Humvee, Sir.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Donkeys. Use donkeys.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I don't believe we have any of those on hand, Sir.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Jesus, Lord. You Americans really are incompetent. No donkeys on hand? What do you think I'm talking about, a full squadron of farm animals?
N: Eldridge trying to stay on task.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: SIR--
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Go downstairs, grab a farmer or one of those street vendors and procure - meaning purchase, buy - several donkeys. Then tow this car bomb away from my office.
E: cutting him off
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Sir, I'm going to need you to step away from the window.
E: STEELING HIMSELF
N: Geddes looks out the window at the burning car. SANBORN His walkie barks to life.
C: JAMES O.S.
D: Lot of pink Det cord here.
E: over Sanborn's walkie
C: SANBORN
D: Where's the switch?
E: INTO TALKIE
N: JAMES
C: JAMES
D: Not in the back seat.
E: HEADSET
N: James is now in the front seat, tearing up the upholstery.
C: JAMES CONT'D
D: Not in the front seat. Doors. Dash.
E: HEADSET
N: A WISP of smoke curls out of the heating vents. James doesn't notice.
C: SANBORN O.S.
D: If you haven't found it yet, it's probably under the car.
E: WALKIE-TALKIE
C: JAMES
D: None of the cord goes under. It's up here -- somewhere.
E: HEADSET
C: SANBORN O.S.
D: Try the weather-stripping.
E: WALKIE-TALKIE
N: James rips off a chunk of weather stripping. Just bare metal. SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: It's been thirty seconds. You need to bail.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: JAMES O.S.
D: I can find it.
E: WALKIE-TALKIE
N: JAMES He crawls to the back seat, slipping on the foam and slime. More smoke escapes from the vents.
C: SANBORN O.S.
D: James, seriously, you need to bail.
E: WALKIE-TALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Roger that. Be right out.
E: HEADSET
N: James retraces what's left of the wire, yet again, ignoring Sanborn. He sits back in the seat, strangely relaxed.
S: EXT. ALLEY
N: A shadow comes into Sanborn's sight. It's an IRAQI on a bicycle, riding straight towards him.
C: ELDRIDGE O.S.
D: Incoming.
E: WALKIE-TALKIE
N: Sanborn raises his rifle. The man peddles on, waving his hand.
C: BICYCLIST
D: Where is the entrance to this building?
E: IN ARABIC
C: SANBORN
D: Imshee! Imshee!
N: The bicyclist looks at the car. ELDRIDGE Trains his scope on the head of the bicyclist.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I'm going to burn him on three. One.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: Geddes just looks at the big man at the window.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Oh, that's rich. Give him a count.
N: Through Eldridge's scope the bicyclist grows. He flicks off his safety.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Blaster Mike, do you copy? ) Please don't make me kill you.
E: INTO WALKIE TO HIMSELF
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Been in combat very long?
N: SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that. James, you need to get out. There's another potential bomber here.
E: into walkie to Eldridge TO JAMES
N: BACK TO JAMES
C: JAMES
D: So shoot him.
E: TO SANBORN
N: BACK TO SANBORN

D: Two!!
E: INTO WALKIE
N: SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: Negative, Negative. Hold your fire. Get the fuck out of here!
E: INTO WALKIE shouting at bicyclist
N: The bicyclist does an about face, but not before casting a last suspicious glance back at the car bomb. Sanborn refocuses on the Opal; he's losing his cool.
C: SANBORN
D: Blaster One, do you copy, over?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: JAMES Still sitting in the back seat. Now he sees the smoking vent.
C: JAMES
D: Gimmie a minute.
E: HEADSET
N: ELDRIDGE Eyes never leaving the street below, flicks the safety of his rifle back on. Geddes notices the sweat on Eldridge's face, and feels a sudden surge of sympathy for the younger man.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Well done. That took great self control.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Thank you, sir. Again, I apologize for the intrusion into --
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: Yes, but I doubt the insurgents will appreciate your restraint. If I may give you a piece of free advice, next time, pull the trigger.
E: in a kindly, paternal tone
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Well, actually, the uh--rules --
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: That's the only way out, I'm afraid. When you're in a losing battle, you have to draw blood. No insurgency in modern history has ever been truly defeated, so all you can do is manage your exit. Clear a wide swath of bodies so you have room to withdraw.
N: Suddenly the office door opens and a YOUNG AIDE appears.
C: AIDE
D: The building is empty, Sir, except for you.
N: Geddes nods, grabs his coat and moves to Eldridge for one last jab.
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: I'm sorry to say it, but that's just how it's done. You need to show some vigor. In Kenya, we executed the insurgents in their beds, until they gave us room. Falklands, the same. That's just how it's done.
N: Eldridge looks up, he's had enough. Swings around.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Is that how you did it in Northern Ireland? With murder?
C: AMBASSADOR GEDDES
D: There you are. Now you're showing some vigor.
E: SMILING
N: And leaves.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: J.T, the building is clear now. We can pull out.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: Roger that. Will, we can pull out. The building is evacuated. James?
E: INTO WALKIE to James NO ANSWER
N: Still no answer.
C: SANBORN
D: Blaster One, we are cleared to leave this fucking site. Walk away. Do you copy, over?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: JAMES
C: JAMES
D: Stay where you are, Sanborn. I'm not done.
E: HEADSET
N: And with that, James turns off his walkie. CLICK. ELDRIDGE
C: ELDRIDGE
D: J.T., are we moving?
E: INTO WALKIE
N: SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: Negative. Negative.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: ELDRIDGE O.S.
D: I didn't copy that. Did you say negative?
E: OVER TALKIE
C: SANBORN
D: Roger. We are staying until James is finished. James, what's the situation? Goddamn, Will, I need a report.
E: INTO WALKIE NERVOUSLY NO ANSWER
N: JAMES James' POV. He sees in the corner of the back seat, having just wiped away a puddle of fire retardant, a little black box, with a wire leading out of it. He grabs the box.
C: JAMES
D: Got it.
N: BLUE OPAL The black box goes flying out of the car.
S: EXT MOUTH OF CUL DE SAC
N: Sanborn is furious, stalking ahead of James as they return uprange. Sanborn passes Eldridge, who has come down from the ambassador's office.
C: SANBORN
D: Take the suit.
N: HUMVEE James' face looks flushed, red, sweat dripping. Eldridge begins ripping apart the Velcro from James' legs. MOMENTS LATER James sits in the car, smoking. Sanborn leans into the window.
C: SANBORN
D: Hey, James.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah?
N: Sanborn JABS him in the jaw, knocking the cigarette out.
C: SANBORN
D: Don't you turn off your walkie again.
N: Sanborn stalks off and James explodes out of the car. He crouches down -- searching the floor of the Humvee. Sees his cigarette, damaged and dirty on the mucky floor, but still burning. He extracts it and carefully cleans it off, then jumps on the hood of the Humvee and goes back to his smoke. He's calm as can be. The Marlboro man. As he puffs away, watching Sanborn converse with a group of SOLDIERS, a JEEP drives up. COLONEL REED jumps out wearing a uniform covered in army bling - medals he won a long time ago, before he traveled up the food chain. An AIDE trots along beside him.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Hi boys.
N: James turns around.
C: JAMES
D: Hello, sir.
E: UNCHARACTERISTICALLY AWED
C: COLONEL REED
D: That you in the bomb suit?
E: points to James
C: JAMES
D: Yes, sir, it was.
C: COLONEL REED
D: You were the guy in the flaming car, Sergeant James?
E: reading his name tag
N: James is concerned.
C: JAMES
D: Yes, sir.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Well hot damn, that was some hot shit. You're a wild man, you know that?
N: The Colonel spins his head around to Eldridge.
C: COLONEL REED
D: He's a wild man, you know that? Let me shake your hand.
E: back to James
N: Extending his meaty paw.
C: JAMES
D: Thank you, sir.
N: Slapping him on the back.
C: COLONEL REED
D: How many bombs have you disarmed, Sergeant?
N: James seems slightly self-conscious. Eldridge listens in.
C: JAMES
D: Hell, I'm not sure. A lot.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Sergeant, I asked you a question.
C: JAMES
D: One seven three. Counting today, Sir.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Holy shit. One hundred and seventy fucking three bombs. God damn. That must be a record. So tell me, what's the best way to go about disarming one of these things?
N: James doesn't answer as he looks at the black box. Finally:
C: JAMES
D: The way you don't die.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Good one, spoken like a wild man. I'd like a picture with this man - anybody here have a camera?
E: LAUGHING LOOKING AROUND
N: A nearby soldier holds a digital camera up to his eye. Colonel Reed smiles big, arm draped around James's shoulders. SNAP.
C: JAMES
D: Thanks, sir, thank you very much. Sir, couldn't do it without my team Hey, Sanborn! Get over here!
E: looking around for Sanborn
N: Sanborn trots over, glowering.
C: JAMES
D: This here is Sergeant Sanborn, the key to the whole team. And Specialist Eldridge.
E: to Col. Reed rubbing it in
N: Colonel Reed extends his hand. Sanborn is shocked.
C: COLONEL REED
D: You guys should all get Bronze stars and I'm gonna recommend it.
C: JAMES ELDRIDGE
D: Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir.
C: SANBORN
D: Thanks, Sir.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Good luck, boys. Keep on keeping on.
N: FEW FEET AWAY Out of earshot Colonel Reed addresses his aide.
C: COLONEL REED
D: You wouldn't catch me walking down on no fuckin' bomb. Hell no, you're not gonna get me in that monkey suit.
N: HUMVEE James sits in the front with his IPOD earphones on. Lost to the world. Eldridge starts to climb into the turret. Before he does he speaks softly to Sanborn.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Bronze star?
C: SANBORN
D: I don't care, the guy is not safe. You can have mine and I'll pin it on your coffin.
E: not caring that James may overhear
C: ELDRIDGE
D: So you do think I'm going to die.
C: SANBORN
D: Fuck, Owen. I don't know. Probably not.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY WEAPONS DISCHARGE STATION AFTERNOON
N: James, Sanborn and Eldridge are discharging their weapons, dry firing them into steel drums. Clicking of ammunition. Long shadows.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY FIRST SERGEANT'S TRAILER AFTERNOON
N: James steps out, grabs a smoke, as a soccer ball rolls beside him. It's Pele's. Inviting James to play.
C: PELE
D: Ball! Ball!
E: SHOUTING
N: James picks it up, and carries it over to a pile of sandbags and sits down. Pele runs up.
C: PELE
D: Give it.
C: JAMES
D: Give me my five bucks and I'll give you your ball.
C: PELE
D: Five dollars - for what?
C: JAMES
D: Those DVDs were crap. They were so fuzzy I couldn't see a thing.
C: PELE
D: No, impossible.
C: JAMES
D: I'm telling you, they were fuzzy.
C: PELE
D: That's Hollywood, my man. Special effects.
N: The boy's chutzpa amuses James. He's starting to like this kid.
C: JAMES
D: What's your name anyway?
C: PELE
D: Pele.
C: JAMES
D: Oh yeah - like the soccer player?
C: PELE
D: Yes, the great Pele
N: James gets up. Motions for the kid to give him space.
C: JAMES
D: Ready? One, two --
N: He smashes the ball in Pele's direction -- it flies up. Pele blocks it easily, kicking high in the air.
C: JAMES
D: -- three. Shit.
N: Pele comes back over to James, who has sat back down. He notices the bomb patch on James' uniform.
C: PELE
D: So you are EOD -- boomala boomala. It's fun, no?
E: pointing to the patch
C: JAMES
D: I like to disarm them. Tell you what, kid, I'll buy another DVD from you but if this one is fuzzy you better watch out. Cause I'm coming for you.
S: INT CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT DAY
N: Sanborn and Eldridge eat together. In the corner of the room, James is eating alone in a sea of soldiers.
S: INT CAMP VICTORY HEAD SHED
N: Eldridge and the psychiatrist are back in session.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What if I should be pulling the trigger more often? Killing people? Bomb makers.
E: LEANING FORWARD
C: LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE
D: That's not your mission. Your mission is to protect life. Render safe.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: But what if I need to change the mission - to survive? That bicyclist I told you about? I'm ninety percent sure he was an insurgent. I could have shot him. Not my mission. But it would have been legal.
C: LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE
D: You don't have to turn into an animal just to protect yourself.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You don't?
C: LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE
D: No.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: And you know this from your extensive work in the field.
C: LT. COL. CAMBBRIDGE
D: I've done my field duty.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Where was that? Yale?
C: LT. COL CAMBRIDGE
D: Look, Specialist, if you want to stop talking to me, you can. These sessions are voluntary. You chose to be here, talking to me, just like you chose the Army, just like you chose EOD. You're in an elite volunteer unit. Not many guys have the IQ or the nerves to do it. Be proud of it.
N: Eldridge considers this. The psychiatrist taps his pencil. Waiting.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Keep the soldier in the fight and the fight in the soldier, right Doc?
N: Eldridge puts out his hand, and they shake.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Seriously, I appreciate what you're saying. But you need to get out from behind this desk more.
S: INT CAMP VICTORY LAUNDRY ROOM NIGHT
N: James is watching his clothes dry as they tumble around the machine. Sanborn comes in with a pile of laundry. Sees James.
C: SANBORN
D: Hey.
C: JAMES
D: Hey.
N: Sanborn stuffs his laundry into a machine. James is still watching the drier, starts to speak.
C: JAMES
D: If you ever get in my shoes and put on the bomb suit you'll see your whole mind changes when you're in front of a bomb. You lose 20 IQ points just from the weight of the suit. Your brain gets so much adrenaline that you hallucinate. Turn off the walkie?
E: QUIETLY
N: Sanborn stares straight ahead.
C: JAMES
D: You'll be lucky if all you do is turn off the walkie.
N: Off the spinning dryer, we --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BAGHDAD SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY MID AFTERNOON
N: Heat playing tricks with light on the ribbon of road - imaginary water pooling on the surface. Again, the auditory landscape of Baghdad: distant CALL to prayer and the incessant RAT-TAT-TAT of gunfire. TITLE OVER: DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 23 James is walking uprange with a large artillery shell. It looks very heavy and he's sweating profusely. He brings the bomb to the Humvee where Sanborn and Eldridge are waiting. They're also suffering in the heat. They take the shell from him, and stow it in the truck.
C: JAMES
D: How are we on water? I'm dying.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: J.T.'s got some.
C: JAMES
D: Water?
E: TO SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: No. I'm all out.
N: James just looks at him.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BAGHDAD PURGATORY DAY
N: We're at the south end of an EXPLOSIVES DISPOSAL RANGE, nicknamed, `Purgatory' -- an empty expanse of dirt pockmarked with craters and bordered on one side by a small number of dwellings. BOOM!!! A huge bomb explodes, sending dust and debris into the air in a mini mushroom cloud...We move across the field with the cloud, and settle where our EOD team is positioned by their Humvee. Sanborn has a remote detonator in his hand and is about to blow it.
C: SANBORN
D: Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole
N: James interrupts --
C: JAMES
D: Hold on a second. I think I forgot my gloves back there.
N: James jumps into the Humvee and drives down range, reversing the course we just took. It's a long way to the explosives, at least half a mile, and Sanborn and Eldridge watch him recede in the distance. James is a tiny figure, ambling around the explosives pile. There's nobody else around. Sanborn looks down at the detonator in his hand. Eldridge notices the look.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Those detonators break all the time. Accidental misfire.
C: SANBORN
D: With that shot laid out like that, it could be a UXO that just cooks off.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Boom.
C: SANBORN
D: Boom.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: A shot that size would obliterate everything in its path.
C: SANBORN
D: His helmet, you'd have that.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Oh yeah, there'd be half a helmet somewhere.
C: SANBORN
D: And little bits of hair stuck to it.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Little bits of hair.
C: SANBORN
D: We'd have to recommend a major change in techniques and protocols so that kind of accident never happens again. You'd write the first draft of the report.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Are you serious?
C: SANBORN
D: I'm not going to write it.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: No, are you serious about killing him?
N: -- Sanborn looks up at Eldridge. Smiles. James starts driving back uprange.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT FIELD OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD LATE AFTERNOON
N: Another dusty nowhere. The EOD team is stopped in the middle of a road that cuts through a swath of desert. At the roadside are several SOLDIERS and their vehicles. The soldiers look sunburned, tired. Sanborn and Eldridge are near the soldiers, looking down the road where -- TITLE OVER: DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 17 CRATER James is inside a CRATER in the middle of the road, working on an EIGHT-FOOT MISSILE. He attaches A ROCKET WRENCH, a metal band with two explosive tubes, to the nose of the missile -- and flips a switch. The two tubes ignite like a firecracker, shooting small flames. Then the flames grow and band spins and FLIES off, ZIPPING into the air above James' head like a metal frisbee, landing fifty feet away. James peers into the nose cone. A hollow void.
C: SANBORN
D: James? Do you copy? James?
E: OVER WALKIE
N: He climbs to the top of the crater.
C: JAMES
D: It's empty.
E: INTO HEADSET
S: EXT/INT CRATER MOMENTS LATER
N: The soldiers are gathered around the pit to see EOD work. It's not everyday you get to see an eight foot missile towed out of a hole. James is down in the pit. Sanborn hands him a chain. Working together, they wrap it around the missile. When they're done, Sanborn signals Eldridge, who is behind the wheel of the Humvee, ready to tow the missile out of the crater.
C: SANBORN
D: Rock it out, slowly.
E: TO ELDRIDGE
N: The chain creaks, then stops. The tires spin uselessly.
C: SANBORN
D: Try gunning it.
E: CONT'D
N: The tires only spin faster. Sanborn moves to get a closer look. His knees come very near to the creaking chain.
C: JAMES
D: Sanborn, watch that chain.
E: seeing this from the pit
C: SANBORN
D: It's alright.
N: When... KA-BOOOOM -- the sky flashes orange overhead --James flat on his back, dazed. A shard of metal ZOOMS into the pit, missing him by inches -- as the soldiers dive into the pit for cover, shouting "RPG, RPG!" HUMVEE Eldridge, who is in the driver's seat, starts shooting his M4 rifle.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What am I shooting at?
E: SHOUTING
N: Sanborn jumping into the Humvee.
C: SANBORN
D: I don't fucking know! -- but James is down!!!
E: SHOUTING BACK
N: He fires in the same direction as Eldridge. The Humvee gets peppered with bullets. The armor holds. But it doesn't look like it's going to last for much longer. Sanborn grabs Eldridge. And they dive back into the pit, joining James and THREE SOLDIERS: a SERGEANT one PRIVATE and a CORPORAL who is a SNIPER. James is sitting up, taking off his bomb suit. He appears to be unharmed. ROAD One of the soldiers is in the turret of a Humvee, firing the big .50 machine gun in all directions. CRATER
C: SERGEANT
D: Get up there with your Barret and help him out.
E: TO SNIPER
N: [Note: Barret is the large .50 SNIPER RIFLE carried by one of the soldiers, a specialty gun with an extremely long range.] The SNIPER hoists the heavy gun to the edge of the crater and looks down the scope. As he does, Sanborn, Eldridge, and James, and the other soldiers pop up and lay down covering fire. Then they quickly pop back down. ROAD The soldier in the Humvee is still churning his machine gun, shooting in all directions, expending hundreds of bullets a minute. CRATER
C: SNIPER
D: I don't see nothing out there. Chris is shooting wild.
E: TO SERGEANT
C: SERGEANT
D: Hey Chris - can you hear me? Chill out on the fifty man.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: ROAD The soldier in the Humvee fires a few more seconds. Picks up his walkie.
C: SOLDIER
D: Copy that.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: -- As a bullet hits him in the neck, killing him instantly. CRATER
C: SNIPER
D: Holy shit. He killed Chris.
N: Everyone in the pit pops up and fires in every direction, a knee-jerk response. A soldier picks up his walkie and keys it. We can't hear him talking over the retorts of the soldiers firing rifles. The men are pinned down, paralyzed by fear. Sniper fire from one of the buildings rakes the top of the crater. -- Bullets kick up sand on the far side of the crater, opposite the men. -- Eldridge looks like he's having a heart attack. This is how it ends, he thinks. --James seems preternaturally calm. After a while --
C: JAMES
D: We should save our ammo at least until we can see these bastards.
N: The Sergeant takes off his pack, and pulls out a pair of binoculars. Inching up to the edge of the crater, where he joins the SNIPER
C: SERGEANT
D: Do you see anything.
E: TO SNIPER
C: SNIPER
D: It's got to be coming from those buildings. Somebody moved on the roof of the tall one there.
N: We see the buildings in the distance. They look too far away to be threatening.
C: SERGEANT
D: Hit him if you see him again.
N: As suddenly -- The SNIPER is hit in the breastbone.
C: SERGEANT
D: Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Jesus.
N: In the pit: total meltdown. This is it. The day you die. Everyone starts talking at once.
C: SOLDIER SANBORN
D: Man we got to get out of I'll get on the Barret. here.
C: ELDRIDGE SERGEANT
D: Don't do that J.T. Shit. Okay. We need help. ) This is Alpha Nine. We're in deep shit. Over.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: DISPATCH JAMES
D: Roger that, Alpha Nine. Go ahead. Let me see those binocs.
E: O.S. to Sergeant
N: The Sergeant hands the binocs to James.
C: SERGEANT
D: We are taking incoming fire. I have two KIA. The grid --
E: INTO WALKIE
N: James gives Sanborn a look. He leans in to say something to Sanborn, which we can't hear. Over the Sergeant's walkie:
C: DISPATCH
D: I know where you are Alpha. Go ahead.
E: O.S.
N: Sanborn crawls into the SNIPER's position, moving the dead body out of the way. James follows next to him to observe with the binocs
C: SERGEANT
D: Copy that. Okay. Can you get us some help. Don't do that fellas.
E: INTO WALKIE to James and Sanborn
N: Sanborn is already shooting. The SNIPER RIFLE puts down bullets slowly. It has a clip of six rounds. One by one Sanborn expends them.
C: JAMES
D: Eldridge, I need ammo.
N: Eldridge pulls two clips of ammunition off the bloody chest of the dead sniper.
C: JAMES
D: (looking through the
C: BINOCS)
D: You're shooting high.
N: Eldridge hands the ammo to Sanborn, who jams the clip in the rifle, and then adjusts the sight. He pulls the trigger. The gun jams.
C: JAMES
D: Clear it, clear it. Eldridge clean the bullets. The blood is making them jam.
E: TO SANBORN the clip is removed, passed to James
N: Eldridge is handed the bloody clips. He pops the bullets out, one by one, and tries to clean them. But the blood is sticky. A bullet slips out of his hand, rolls down the crater. The soldier helps him by picking up the bullet and cleaning it. James looks back to see Eldridge's progress.
C: JAMES
D: Spit on `em Eldridge. Spit. Rub. Spit rub.
N: Eldridge is trying. He's really trying.
C: JAMES
D: Come on, Eldridge. I need ammo.
N: James sees that Eldridge is not getting it and he draws close to him.
C: JAMES
D: You're doing good, man. . You're okay.
E: putting his hand on Eldridge's shoulder
N: Eldridge nods. His mind is there but his hands are disobeying him. James attempts to clear his head.
C: JAMES
D: I will keep you safe, Owen, that's my job.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Roger.
N: The soldier hands the ammo to James.
C: JAMES
D: Alright. Scan your sectors.
E: to both of them
N: Then Eldridge positions himself so he's looking in the opposite direction that James and Sanborn are looking. Sanborn fires two more rounds.
C: JAMES
D: Still high, adjust your windage. Elevation.
E: CALMLY
C: SANBORN
D: Got it.
N: SNIPER RIFLE POV The roof of the tall building in the distance bobs in and out of view. At this great range, the scope dances. CRATER
C: JAMES
D: He's on the left by the smoke stack. Guy in white.
N: Sanborn fires once. He turns his head away from the gun and makes an audible exhale to release tension -- the sniper breath control technique.
C: JAMES
D: Good. There's another one just behind him. Up a meter.
N: Sanborn fires once. Audible exhale.
C: JAMES
D: Good.
N: James scans the area. Silence. CRATER AN HOUR LATER The sun lower in the sky. Around the pit, the fallen soldier has been pushed to one side, and the living are hanging on to their sanity. Eldridge and the remaining soldier have exhausted their water supply. Sanborn and James are in EXACTLY the same position as when we left them. Focused. Sanborn's finger on the trigger. Sanborn breathes out, the sniper breathing. He's been doing this for an hour, time and the desert heat have taken their toll. Sanborn blinks sweat away. SANBORN POV The scope BLURS. He regains focus. JAMES Noticing Sanborn's fatigue.
C: JAMES
D: Eldridge, grab me the juice out of an MRE.
N: Eldridge digs around the DEAD SOLDIER'S backpack and retrieves a packet of juice, which he passes to James. James inserts the straw into the juice pack. He hesitates, not sure if Sanborn will accept the gesture after all the hostility that's passed between them. But he brings the straw to Sanborn's lips. At first, Sanborn keeps his attention on the rifle scope. But then he opens his parched mouth, and sips. --Suddenly, there's movement, a flutter of fabric, in the distance off Eldridge's shoulder. He stiffens.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Uh, Will.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: At my one o'clock. Two hundred meters. Something moved behind a parked car. Either a tan dog or a man in a light-colored shirt.
C: JAMES
D: Deal with it.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Uh--Ok.
N: Eldridge looks down his scope, unsure. James keeps his focus forward on the building.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I don't think it's a dog. Should I fire?
C: JAMES
D: It's your call.
N: Eldridge shifts his weight onto his rifle. There's a flutter of movement in the distance. Eldridge pulls the trigger. Spraying the car in the distance. Empties his entire magazine. From behind the car, something falls to the ground, and the tiniest sliver of a rifle clatters after it. The soldier in the pit comes over to Eldridge to see what he's done.
C: SOLDIER
D: Good hit, man.
N: James and Sanborn don't turn around. Eldridge slumps, spent. CRATER TWO HOURS LATER Sun casting long shadows. James and Sanborn in the same focused position. Eldridge still watches the rear. The soldier in the pit reaches his breaking point.
C: SOLDIER
D: I'm going to go for the Humvee. What do you say?
C: SERGEANT
D: I don't know.
C: SOLDIER
D: We've been here two hours and they ain't seen nothing. I'm going to go for it.
N: And with that he dashes up and out of the crater. Sanborn keeps his eye on the scope. ROAD The soldier runs to the Humvee, gets in, and turns the vehicle around, driving it back to the pit. He dives out of the vehicle and back to the pit.
C: SOLDIER
D: Those fuckers are dead.
E: EXCITED
C: SERGEANT
D: What if they hit us with an RPG when we get out? What if they were just waiting for us to get in the Humvee.
C: SOLDIER
D: It's safe. I'm telling you You got those fuckers.
E: TO SANBORN
N: The soldier jumps out of the pit. Stands in the middle of the road. A sitting duck.
C: SOLDIER
D: See? You got them. (turning to building,
E: to men in the pit
C: SHOUTING)
D: We got you mother fuckers. You're fucking dead Hajis. Haha.
N: The soldier pulls down his pants and moons the building.
C: SOLDIER
D: Kiss this mother fucker!!!
N: James lowers his binocs. Sanborn lowers his rifle. They exchange a mirthful look.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT CAMP VICTORY JAMES' TRAILER NIGHT
N: James and Sanborn face each other; both men are red-faced, drunk, swaying.
C: JAMES
D: Ready?
N: Sanborn nods. Wham! Sanborn reels back from the punch. James is standing over him. Glowering. He looks good. The rage is like a vitamin.
C: JAMES
D: Now we're even.
N: Sanborn stumbles back, recovers. Around them in James' room are the remains of an Irish wake: two bottles of Scotch, already empty. A third half gone. Cigarettes burned down in an ashtray.
C: SANBORN
D: Be right back. I gotta piss.
N: As Sanborn stumbles out, James turns to Eldridge
C: JAMES
D: One more, boy.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: (imitating a young
C: RECRUIT)
D: Yes, Sir, Sergeant James Sir. You're not very good drunk are you SIR!! You're a good fighter, Sir. Natural born warrior, Sir.
C: JAMES
D: You acquitted yourself well on the field of battle today.
E: SEMI-SERIOUSLY
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Really? I got scared.
C: JAMES
D: Everyone is a coward at some point in their lives.
N: Sanborn comes in. He sees a box under James' bed. Sanborn picks up the box under James' bed and plops it on the table, intentionally breaking up the love-fest between James and Eldridge.
C: SANBORN
D: Hey Owen, look! Will has possessions! I didn't know you owned anything, Will.
N: Sanborn pulls a picture frame out of the box. It's a picture of a baby boy. Eldridge leans in.
C: JAMES
D: That's my son. A real tough little bastard. Like me.
C: SANBORN
D: So you're married?
N: James is uncomfortable with the subject. Intimacy isn't easy for him. He rolls his eyes, nods.
C: JAMES
D: Well, she was my girlfriend, we had a baby, then she became my wife, then we got divorced. I thought we got divorced. But she's still in the house, and she says we're still together.
E: pause pause MORE
C: JAMES
D: So, I don't know. What does that make her?
E: CONT'D
C: SANBORN
D: Dumb, to be with you?
C: JAMES
D: She ain't dumb. She's loyal.
C: SANBORN
D: My problem is the one girl who I like keeps talking about kids. Kids. Kids.
C: JAMES
D: Give her your sperm, stud.
E: TO SANBORN
C: SANBORN
D: Nah. I'm not ready. ) And what's this?
E: looking around the box, finds a circuit board.
N: Sanborn sees there are many such parts in the box.
C: JAMES
D: Bomb parts.
C: SANBORN
D: No shit. Why do you have them?
N: James reaches into the box. Pulls out a circuit. Looks at it admiringly.
C: JAMES
D: This is from the Blue Opal. It's wild, isn't it, to hold something in your hands that could have killed you.
E: to himself he tosses the board to Sanborn
N: Eldridge leans over, pulls another board out of the box. He's fascinated by James' obsession.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What's this one from?
C: JAMES
D: That was one of our early roadside bombs we disarmed, the one with --
E: warming to the attention
C: SANBORN
D: --it's a piece of junk from Radio Shack.
E: looking at the board
N: James shrugs. He reaches over to get the circuit board from Sanborn, who clearly doesn't share his fascination.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: IT'S INTERESTING
C: JAMES
D: I agree.
N: In the distance, sound of BOMBS going off. The men pause to listen.
C: SANBORN
D: The only reason he likes you is because you act like his bitch, and you look up to him, and he likes to be the top dog.
E: TO ELDRIDGE
C: JAMES
D: I agree with that too.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Oh no, The humiliation is too great to bear. . Good-bye world.
E: picking up James' pistol he pulls the trigger while slipping out the clip
N: The gun clicks harmlessly. Eldridge laughs. A gust of wind rattles the front door.
C: SANBORN
D: That punch was harder than I hit you. I'm owed a good one.
C: JAMES
D: Alright.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Hold on, we need some rules. No face shots.
N: James lifts off his shirt, getting into fighting mode. Eldridge picks up a marker and begins to draw a bulls-eye on James' stomach, stopping when he sees a cluster of scars.
C: JAMES
D: Beauty mark, my mother dropped me at birth.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Looks like frag scars.
N: Sanborn slugs James. James doubles over, loses his balance and falls back. James gets up, laughing so hard it hurts. Tears of laughter falling down his face.
C: JAMES
D: Ahhhh! Excellent. Now your turn.
N: Sanborn braces for the blow. James gets ready to strike, then fakes a swing -- his fist stops just shy of Sanborn's cheek. Sanborn's eyes go wide as -- James nails him with his other hand, right in the gut -- Sanborn doubles over.
C: JAMES
D: Looks like it hurt.
E: LAUGHING
N: Moving forward aggressively, suddenly James looks like he could kill. A complete change in his demeanor, as wind rocks the trailer, causing the light bulb to rattle and cast a STRANGE SHADOW -- then James rushes Sanborn, tackling him -- they crash into the corner of the room -- in a flash James is on top of Sanborn, pinning him -- Sanborn moves to punch James but James pins his hands -- James taps Sanborn lightly on the cheek, caressing his cheek.
C: JAMES
D: There there. It'll be okay.
C: SANBORN
D: Get off of me you freak.
N: Sanborn tries to buck James off. Forcefully raising his hips.
C: JAMES
D: Oh yeah, ride me, ride me.
N: Sanborn reaches for his boot knife. He flicks it open, brings the blade to James' throat. Their eyes lock. James dismounts, laughing. Stumbles back to the table.
C: JAMES
D: You're alright, Sanborn. Let's have another.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY LATER
N: The wind is blowing harder, kicking up sand. Overhead, a full moon is blazing. James looks up at the moon. It's dazzling. James and Eldridge support Sanborn as they weave towards Eldridge's trailer.
C: JAMES
D: I got him.
N: Eldridge passes Sanborn off to James, and heads up the stairs to his trailer.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Later.
N: Sanborn sags. James pulls him back. They walk a little farther to Sanborn's trailer --
C: JAMES
D: Okay. Here we go big boy.
N: And half carries Sanborn up the steps.
S: INT. SANBORN'S TRAILER
N: James eases Sanborn onto a cot, and as he falls onto the cot, the WHITE ENVELOPE falls out of his pocket.
C: SANBORN
D: Do you think I have what it takes to get in the bomb suit?
N: James didn't expect this.
C: JAMES
D: Sure.
N: James picks up the white envelope and puts it on Sanborn's night table. He looks back. Sanborn is already asleep.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY AFTER MIDNIGHT
N: The whole camp is asleep but James is standing outside, holding a satellite phone. He's swaying. Drunk.
C: CONNIE O.S.
D: James, my God, what time is it? Are you alright.
E: SLEEPILY
N: Pause.
C: CONNIE O.S.
D: James?
C: JAMES
D: I'm doing fine, babe. How are you?
E: SLIGHTLY SLURRED
C: CONNIE O.S.
D: Well, you woke me up. But - ah - we - we're fine. Will junior said "bobba" He means bottle, but he's talking, Will.
E: getting more lively
N: James looks around the camp. All he sees is its immensity, the tremendous scope of the operation. This is military might, raw power. As good as it gets.
C: JAMES
D: Great. I'll call you tomorrow when you're awake.
C: CONNIE O.S.
D: Will, I can't wait until you come home.
N: Silence.
C: CONNIE
D: Will?
E: CONT'D
C: JAMES
D: (trying his best to mean
C: IT)
D: Yeah, me too.
C: CONNIE O.S.
D: Will you call me again soon?
C: JAMES
D: Sure. Bye honey.
C: CONNIE O.S.
D: Bye honey.
N: James hits the END button on the phone and walks up the steps to his trailer --
S: INT JAMES TRAILER LATER THAT NIGHT
N: He stumbles inside, drops the satellite phone down on his desk, next to his bomb suit helmet, and sinks into bed. He lies there, clothed and awake, and stares at the helmet, looking at his reflection in the polished glass. Then James reaches over to the helmet and lifts it up, hefts it. He puts the helmet on his head. Alone in his bed, wearing his helmet. Smiling behind the glass, for he now he can sense the bomb, and feel his nearness to death. We hear the RASP of his breathing.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT SANBORN'S TRAILER MORNING
N: Sanborn blinks awake to a painfully bright sun. He shifts his attention to the white envelope on the table.
S: INT CAMP VICTORY WAREHOUSE DAY
N: A SOLDIER wearing glasses is talking to Sanborn.
C: SOLDIER
D: What can I do for you?
C: SANBORN
D: I have something?
C: SOLDIER
D: Remains?
C: SANBORN
D: No.
C: SOLDIER
D: Personal effects?
C: SANBORN
D: Yeah.
N: Sanborn reaches into his back pocket, withdraws the white envelope. He opens it. Inside are Thompson's DOG TAGS. He crumples the envelope, lets it fall to the floor. And grips the tags tightly.
C: SOLDIER
D: What's the name?
C: SANBORN
D: Thompson, Matt. Sergeant EOD. Baker Company.
C: SOLDIER
D: Okay let me see. He's at three- three-eight. third aisle down the hall.
E: looking at a form looking
N: Sanborn turns to look, and now we see where he's standing: in the MORTUARY AFFAIRS UNIT, in a large room filled with white boxes. It looks like an art installation, each white box spaced evenly in a cavernous space.
C: SOLDIER
D: I'll walk you over there.
N: They walk down the aisles, passing rows and rows of white boxes, and finally stop. The soldier opens one. Inside are a pair of boots. A stack of clothes. Books. Photographs. The remains of a life.
C: SOLDIER
D: Here you go. Did you know him?
N: Sanborn places the tags on the uniform in the box.
C: SANBORN
D: Yeah, I did. He was my team leader.
C: SOLDIER
D: Oh, I'm sorry brother.
N: They walk up the aisles, again passing the rows of white boxes. At the entrance, Sanborn turns. The soldier offers his hand. They shake warmly.
C: SANBORN
D: Thank you. Thank you.
N: The soldier, a little perplexed at Sanborn's gratitude, doesn't know what to say. Sanborn leaves, notices the empty ENVELOPE on the floor. Litter. He picks it up and stuffs it back into his pocket.
S: INT MESS TENT DAY
N: James and Eldridge eat in hung-over silence. Tired. After a while...
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Tough night.
C: JAMES
D: Hell, yeah.
N: Eldridge nods. Wind picks up. The whole tent shakes.
C: JAMES
D: Aren't you supposed to be at your shrink?
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I fired him. I said, Doc, shooting a man had a salubrious effect on me.
C: JAMES
D: What the hell does that mean?
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Healthy.
C: JAMES
D: You're healthy? Well, why not.
N: They go back to eating. Sanborn joins James and Eldridge.
C: SANBORN
D: What's up team?
N: They nod silently as he sits. Sluggishly he throws his hand down on the table.
C: SANBORN
D: Can I get a Huu-haa?
N: Eldridge slaps a tired hand on top of Sanborn's. James follows suit. They wearily lift their arms in mock enthusiasm. All at once: "Huu-haa." Sanborn wolfs down some food.
C: JAMES
D: I'm going back to sleep now.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Let's roll.
N: They get up to bus their trays. And nearing the dirty-tray bin, the flaps of the tent billow more and more vigorously. Outside, a storm is brewing. Each man unfurls the checkered scarf around their neck and wraps their face for the wind.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY DAY
N: Wind rakes sand and dust over the tent city, giving it an otherworldly aspect. Throngs of men and vehicles fight the swirl. It impedes their every move. The three men continue onwards, as the intensity of the storm grows.
S: EXT HEAD SHED DAY
N: The storm is HOWLING now. Visibility is reduced to a few feet. Red sand blows mercilessly. It's Mars. TITLE OVER: DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 16 As they approach the head shed, a Humvee comes blasting out of the storm from the other direction. It skids to a halt in front of them. Three wounded EOD TECHS and an EOD TEAM LEADER tumble out. They look awful. One step shy of death. One man's face is smeared brown. Blood oozes from a deep gash in his cheek. Another tech is covered in black soot. Their hands still clutch their weapons -- the battle still wages in their minds.
C: TEAM LEADER
D: It was a car bomb. Fucking nasty one -- they had a decoy detonator set up so that when I disarmed it nothing happened -- then, I'm walking back uprange to get some more tools and boooom!!! If I hadn't been wearing the suit, I'd be dead right now.
E: shouting to James
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Get a Medic to look at your cheek.
N: The wounded TEAM LEADER touches his face and blood smears on his hand...he looks down...surreal to see your own blood. The First Sergeant trots over.
C: TEAM LEADER
D: ) It's no big deal. It's no big deal. ) Be careful. They're starting to hide the detonator really well.
E: amazed at the sight of HIS BLOOD now turning his attention back to James now turning his attention back to James
N: The FIRST SERGEANT turns his attention to James:
C: FIRST SERGEANT
D: Sorry to ruin your day off, but your team is up.
N: James blinks back sand and dust blowing into his eyes. So much for the nap.
S: INT HUMVEE CAMP VICTORY PARKING LOT
N: Lt. COL. CAMBRIDGE knocks on the window. Startling the men. His face appears in the sand storm.
C: LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE
D: Are you guys about to go out?
E: SHOUTING
C: JAMES
D: Yeah.
C: LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE
D: Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death of sitting behind a desk all the time.
N: James shoots Eldridge a look. Eldridge shrugs.
C: JAMES
D: Anytime, Sir. It's a privilege.
N: The LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE gets in. As they drive out.
C: JAMES
D: Don't mean to insult your intelligence, Sir. But if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out of these windows. They're bullet proof and the round will just bounce around the cabin.
S: EXT. ABU GRAIB CENTER BOMBED OUT BUILDING DAY
N: A partially destroyed building fills the screen. A mess of bricks and rebar. Wind swirls sand up into the air. Nearby, an OLD IRAQI MAN with a DONKEY drawn cart is unloading new bricks to repair the building. Farther up the road, a good distance from the building, are two parked Humvees. Nearby, James and his team are talking to a small cluster of SOLDIERS. SOLDIER 1 (pointing back at the
C: BUILDING)
D: Right up those stairs.
C: JAMES
D: You been inside already?
N: SOLDIER 1 In there? Fuck no. We've had reports of all kinds of shit coming out of that house -- and-- James takes his eyes off the building and turns to the Soldier.
C: JAMES
D: AND WHAT--
N: SOLDIER 1 --bodies. James turns to Cambridge.
C: JAMES
D: Why don't you wait here? We'll bring out anything of interest.
S: INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING LATE MORNING
N: James, Sanborn and Eldridge enter a landing. The floor is very wet. They cross it, and come to a room that has been severely damaged by a bomb, with rubble everywhere and exposed electrical wires dangling from the ceiling, and busted pipes gushing water. A tea pot sits on a STOVE, steaming hot, and a plate on the table has bread on it. James bends the gushing pipe, stemming the flow of water to a trickle. Now the spitting wire hanging above the water pipe looks less ominous. But not by much. CORRIDOR They continue down a narrow corridor, light diminishing. They switch on the lights on their M4s. The corridor ends at a door.
C: SANBORN
D: This would be a great place to put a pressure activator.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah, with like twenty pounds of high explosives on it so you get anyone in the room when you open the door.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Rope trick?
N: Eldridge uncoils rope from his pack and hands it to James, who makes a lasso and tosses it over the doorknob.
S: EXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING
N: James yanks the rope -- we follow the rope inside through the kitchen to the doorknob, watching it turn. No bomb. They head back in.
S: INT DOOR/STAIRS BOMBED OUT BUILDING
N: Ascending a staircase. James unstraps a flash grenade from his vest and heaves it onto the floor above. They stick their fingers in their ears... Blinding FLASH and DEAFENING sound. Then silence. No movement.
C: JAMES
D: Guess no one's home.
C: SOLDIER O.S.
D: Blaster One, what was that?
E: WALKIE-TALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Sorry, one of ours, just a flash grenade.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: They come to a landing that opens up to the second floor. SECOND FLOOR A large cavernous space filled with what looks like Santa's bomb making factory: A pile of motherboards. Batteries. Boom boxes. Electronics in various states of disassembly. In another corner, stacks of artillery shells. Blocks of C4 plastic explosives. In the back half of the room, there is a work table, and on the table is a DEAD BODY of a young man, wearing pants but no shirt. A JACKET draped is over its torso and face. Even for these hardened EOD experts, the sight is unnerving, and the copper smell of spilt blood and death is staggering, sickening. James, Sanborn and Eldridge approach the body cautiously. James pulls a retractable aluminum pole from his pack and telescopes it to its maximum length, about 10 feet, and uses the pole to lift the jacket. Gently. The FACE appears. All that we can determine about this face is that it is young. The distinguishing lines of the nose and cheeks are so covered by bruises and blood and further obscured by the shadows and dappled light, that it could be the face of almost any young man. The violence done to the face exerts an odd pull on James.
C: JAMES
D: The kid at camp.
C: SANBORN
D: What?
C: JAMES
D: He sells DVDs.
C: SANBORN
D: No, that's not him.
C: JAMES
D: You see him every day. He sells DVDs by the mess tent. His name is Pele.
C: SANBORN
D: Different kid.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: This is sick.
N: The dead young man's chest has been cut open. An artillery shell is shoved inside the cavity where the heart used to beat. Wires protrude from the shell. It's meant to be a booby trap, to be placed on a street and elicit as much damage as possible.
C: SANBORN
D: You seen a body bomb before?
N: James shakes his head no. Sanborn moves closer to the body and inspects the wiring in the chest.
C: JAMES
D: Don't touch it. Let's blow it.
N: JAMES Positioning three blocks of C4 on the body, then plugs blasting caps into the explosives. James nods to Sanborn and Eldridge, and they leave him alone with the body. James walks backwards out of the room, unspooling a roll of detonation cord as he goes. But before he gets to the door...
C: SOLDIER O.S.
D: Blaster, we've got a hold. I'm not getting airspace clearance.
E: OVER WALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Copy that, How long?
E: INTO WALKIE
C: SOLDIER
D: Roger. Could be anything. At least 15 minutes is what they're saying.
E: O.S. WALKIE-TALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Can you -- you need to explain to them that we don't have 15 minutes.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: SOLDIER
D: Roger. I'll see if we can push this ahead.
E: O.S. WALKIE-TALKIE
N: James squats down, rests his rifle, looks at the floor. Moments pass and he feels a set of eyes on him. He swivels his head to the left and makes eye contact with the dead kid on the table. The face doesn't have any of the markers of death; it looks alive. James turns away, then is compelled to make eye contact again. He looks at his watch. The seconds tick by all too slowly. He grabs his walkie-talkie.
C: JAMES
D: Fifteen is not going to work. I need to do this now.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: SOLDIER
D: Roger, I understand. If it was me, I would go for it, but I don't think command is going to budge under the circumstances.
E: O.S. WALKIE-TALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Tell command I'm in a fucking war zone. And I'm going to blow now.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: James gets up, clips his rifle, and takes the last few steps out of the room.
C: SOLDIER
D: Blaster One, I don't know who you know, but you got your permission. Ready to det any time you say so.
E: O.S. WALKIE-TALKIE
N: At the door he stops to look at the dead boy on the table. He looks and looks. Finally:
C: JAMES
D: Cancel that det.
E: INTO WALKIE
T: CUT TO:
N: JAMES Reaching over the body of the boy. He pulls the artillery shell out of the boy's abdomen with his bare hands. He wipes his hands on his pants.
C: JAMES
D: This is Blaster One, I'm coming down.
E: INTO WALKIE
S: INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING
N: James carries the body down the staircase. The head and feet bump the sides of the staircase as he descends.
S: EXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING MOMENTS LATER
N: The BODY lies on the street, James standing over it. A blue and white pickup TRUCK emblazoned with the logo of the Iraqi National Police pulls up to their position. A pair of POLICEMEN get out and after a few words with James, they load the body. HUMVEE Sanborn and Eldridge sit across from each other, watching James.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: ...So you really don't think it was the DVD kid?
C: SANBORN
D: No, I don't.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You're positive?
C: SANBORN
D: Yeah. Could it be? One in a million chance.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I don't know. Will seemed positive. But that was weird.
C: SANBORN
D: Very weird.
N: They look out the window and notice Lt. Colonel Cambridge down the street surrounded by a crowd of IRAQI MEN. CAMBRIDGE Cambridge is trying to talk to several of them at once.
C: CAMBRIDGE
D: This is not a safe area for you. Imshee!
N: They don't leave. Cambridge lifts his rifle, not quite shouldering it. Then one MAN, mid thirties, in a suit, steps forward.
C: IRAQI MAN
D: Why do you talk to us like children. We are not children.
E: FLAWLESS ENGLISH
C: CAMBRIDGE
D: Gimme a break, will you?
C: IRAQI MAN
D: Why should I?
N: Cambridge, suddenly not so sure of himself, looks back to the Humvee and sees -- JAMES Watching the police truck drive away. He then moves for the Humvee, motioning for Cambridge to load up.
S: INT HUMVEE
N: Eldridge guzzles some water. Wipes sweat from his brow.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: But then Will's pretty weird. He keeps bomb parts under his bed.
N: Passing the water to Sanborn.
C: SANBORN
D: I bet you he doesn't put this one under his bed.
N: Sanborn laughs. James cracks the door, jumps inside. He sees Cambridge walk past the brick pile that the OLD IRAQI MAN had created. The man is no longer there. Something crosses his mind when-- --The brick pile explodes in a A SICKENING BLAST, obliterating Cambridge and flipping the Humvee --James, Sanborn and Eldridge SPIN upside down as the Humvee is buffeted by the blast - landing upside down. --Suddenly CAMBRIDGE'S helmeted HEAD crashes into the windshield. --Billowing smoke, dirt and debris smears the windshield blotting out the sun. --Inside, a flurry of HANDS yank on the heavy armored Humvee door. It doesn't budge.
S: EXT HUMVEE
N: A SOLDIER runs to the rescue. He reaches for the Humvee door, the metal sears his hand, and he pulls back in pain. The soldier uses his rifle butt to jam the door open - but that doesn't work, because the butt doesn't catch the handle. From inside, the POUNDING and YELLS grow louder. The soldier drops the rifle and grabs the searing metal with his hand, burning his flesh as he pries the handle. The Humvee door finally gives. Three men tumble out onto blackened sand.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING LATER
N: James is standing in the doorway into the building, dividing his attention between the outside and the interior -- where Sanborn and Eldridge are slumped against a wall. Sanborn stares at a blank wall. Eldridge is running his hand over a cigarette lighter -- seeing how much of the flame he can bear. He looks as if he's hoping the physical pain will help put the psychic pain in perspective. James, standing in the light of the doorway, is smoldering with rage and ungovernable purpose. He's smoking. We stay here for a moment to watch as each man makes his own deal with himself. Through the open doorway a Humvee comes into view. James stomps out his cigarette.
C: JAMES
D: Our ride is here.
N: Beat. Sanborn and Eldridge remain in a trance.
C: JAMES
D: We're movin'.
N: He walks out into the glare. Sanborn and Eldridge rise to follow him.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY DUSK
N: Funnel of wind erases a tank tread in the sand. More sand drifts and piles like snow up against a small mountain of sand bags. Sand disappears the windshield of a parked Abrams as day moves into night.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT MORNING
N: Dust. Wind. James is stalking towards an OLDER IRAQI MAN who is selling DVDs at Pele's usual table.
C: JAMES
D: Hey - you haven't seen that kid around here by any chance - who sells movies?
N: The man shakes his head.
C: DVD MAN
D: Sorry. No English.
C: JAMES
D: No English? Don't lie to me. Where's that kid?
C: DVD MAN
D: Sorry, my man. Movie? Five dollars.
N: James shakes his head and walks away, heading towards a clump of SOLDIERS standing in the shade of a tree.
C: JAMES
D: Are you guys responsible for this area?
C: GUARD
D: What's up?
C: JAMES
D: That motherfucker over there could be an insurgent, watching the camp and giving intel to his buddies so they know where to launch their mortars.
E: pointing to the Man
C: GUARD
D: I think he's just a guy selling DVDs.
C: JAMES
D: He's a security risk. You should get rid of him.
C: GUARD
D: The merchants are cleared. I couldn't do anything to him without the say-so from my CO.
N: James realizes that he has no hope of prevailing. Agitated, he turns away, and we stay with him as he trudges down one of Victory's dusty roads.
S: EXT. CAMP VICTORY MESS TENT DUSK
N: It's the end of the day and the DVD seller packs up his wares to go. James, in sunglasses, sweatshirt covering his army fatigues, follows him to his car. James draws near, and points his pistol at the guy's crotch.
C: JAMES
D: Does this change anything?
N: The DVD man looks stunned.
S: INT DVD MAN'S CAR CAMP VICTORY GATE DUSK
N: James leans across the DVD man and flashes his ID to one of two GUARDs.
C: JAMES
D: OGA.
N: The guard looks to his buddy who mouths "CIA"
C: GUARD
D: Are you cleared to leave the camp through this gate, Sir?
N: James nods.
C: GUARD
D: I'm going to need to see your ID again.
C: JAMES
D: Don't fuck with me man, I'm having a bad day already.
N: The guard stares at James. James stares at the guard. The guard shrugs, waves James through.
S: EXT BAGHDAD STREET NIGHT
N: The truck goes down a series of streets. It comes into a poor neighborhood and stops at a house.
C: DVD MAN
D: Pele.
C: JAMES
D: Wait here.
N: James gets out.
S: EXT BAGHDAD STREET HOUSE
N: The dwelling is set back behind a low wall. Hard to see much of it in the dim light. James takes a step forward, toward the wall. SUDDENLY-- the DVD truck peels out. James looks at its retreating tail lights. A moment of indecision as he considers his situation: alone in Baghdad. Then he vaults the low wall, landing in
S: EXT BAGHDAD COURTYARD
N: A modest courtyard. Light comes from one window in the house, the rest is dark. Crickets. James walks around to the back of the house. There's a door. He tries the knob. It opens.
S: INT IRAQI HOUSE HALLWAY
N: In a dark hallway. Murmuring of a television. James moves towards the noise.
S: INT IRAQI HOUSE ANTECHAMBER
N: James comes to an antechamber. Behind it is a very low stone archway. He goes through the archway, where -
S: INT IRAQI HOUSE LIVING ROOM
N: A MAN -- call him Kalim -- older, fifties, dressed in traditional garb, sits at a table drinking tea, watching an Egyptian game show on television. James walks in, gun drawn. The man is spooked. He spills his tea, looks wildly for an exit. James puts his fingers to his lips.
C: JAMES
D: Do you speak English?
C: KALIM
D: English, French, Arabic.
C: JAMES
D: I want the people responsible for Pele.
E: QUIETLY
C: KALIM
D: For whom?
C: JAMES
D: Pele. The body bomb.
C: KALIM
D: Pele? I don't know. But please sit down. I am professor Kalim, this is my home. You are a guest. Sit.
C: JAMES
D: Take me to the people responsible.
C: KALIM
D: Of course, whatever you seek, I will help you find. Please, please sit, down. You are CIA, no? I am very pleased to have CIA in my home.
N: James raises his gun to aim at the man's face.
C: JAMES
D: Maybe you don't understand?
N: The man is suddenly very afraid.
C: KALIM
D: Please, be careful. Be slow. A gun can go off.
N: As the back door opens -- James spins to see -- a WOMAN, older, matronly. She sees James, his gun. And she starts shouting at James in Arabic, then English, "Get out, get out." James swings his gun to her. SUDDENLY-- -- behind the woman comes Pele. He runs to his father's side. -- James turns to the boy, to say something -- -- his mother is rushing James now, swinging a candlestick -- he spins to the door, trying to get out of there -- -- SMASHING his head on the stone archway on his way out.
S: EXT. IRAQI HOUSE
N: -- the street. James is shaken. He looks around, down the street. It's murky. Dangerous. Even the shadows have shadows. He runs...and runs...and we stay on his eyes. Blood runs from the wound on his head. SOUND of far off EXPLOSION. The sky turns orange briefly,
T: then fades into blackness.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY GATE NIGHT
N: A blast of bright white light floods James. He's stunned - and raises his ID in his open palm over his head. A scrap of blood stained fabric is wrapped around his head wound. Multiple rifles suddenly trained on his upturned face. VOICES SLAP CONCRETE:
C: GUARDS
D: On your knees, on your knees!!
N: A big offish GUARD walks up and slams a rifle butt into the side of James' head. He falls to the ground.
C: GUARD
D: What're you doing?
C: JAMES
D: Ficke, ficke.
E: GASPING
N: The guard sees the military ID splayed on the ground.
C: GUARD
D: Yeah?
N: James nods.
C: JAMES
D: Whorehouse two clicks from here.
C: GUARD
D: If I let you in, will you tell me where it is exactly?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY NIGHT
N: James walking along a dark camp road. He walks up to the head shed porch, and goes inside. His walkie, sitting on a desk, comes to life.
C: SANBORN
D: I repeat, do you copy? Do you copy?
E: OVER WALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Yeah, I'm right here. What's up?
E: INTO WALKIE
C: SANBORN
D: Oh nothing.
E: OVER WALKIE MORE
C: SANBORN
D: Just wondering if you might want to join us in the Humvee for a little outing the Army wants us to go on.
E: CONT'D sarcastically
C: JAMES
D: Copy that. What's you're twenty.
E: INTO WALKIE
C: SANBORN
D: We're at the south gate, James. We've been waiting for you for half an hour. Where have you been? Over.
E: OVER WALKIE
S: INT HUMVEE MINUTES LATER
N: James jumps in. Sanborn and Eldridge shoot him impatient looks. Sanborn hits the gas.
C: SANBORN
D: A tanker blew up near the Green Zone about an hour ago. We're doing a post-blast on it. To figure out how the suicide bomber pulled it off. So where did you say you were again?
C: JAMES
D: I didn't. Sergeant. Let's go.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What happened to your head.
C: JAMES
D: Watch the road, Owen.
N: Sanborn looks at him, shakes his head. James stares out the window.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BAGHDAD STREET LATE NIGHT
N: A pair of Humvee headlights, glowing orange in smoke filled air, come rapidly toward us. They stop, the Humvee groans on idle. James' team gets out. They walk down the street, guns low, combat flashlights on.
C: JAMES
D: Sanborn, get the big spotlights.
N: Sanborn doubles back to the truck, roots around in the back, comes running back with two giant flash-lights. James hits the switch. Sanborn hits the switch. A pool of intensely bright light opens in front of them, revealing a rubble strewn street. Concrete. Bits of glass. Metal. Everything that goes into a city -- pulverized. We hear CRUNCHING sounds as the men walk down the street and their feet fall on the blast remnants. The crunching gets louder as they walk towards a GLOWING RED INFERNO at the end of the block. A Soldier's head, then his shoulders visible in the distance.
C: SANBORN
D: Friendlies, coming `in.
C: SOLDIER
D: You guys the Medics?
C: JAMES
D: No, we're EOD.
N: They walk past, deeper into the gloom. Two soldiers run past them, carrying a stretcher.
C: SANBORN
D: Hey.
N: They stop to see what he's looking at. Twisted metal.
C: SANBORN
D: That's an engine block. A big one, too. From a truck probably.
C: JAMES
D: Oil tanker?
C: SANBORN
D: It's what I'm thinking.
N: The men keep walking, and now the SOUNDS from the Inferno are louder. Another man rushes towards them, his face shrouded in blackness. Sanborn points his rifle at the man's head. Hits him with the Hi-Beam of his light. The man is wearing a black wool ski mask.
C: SANBORN
D: Stop! Wagef! Wagef!
C: SKI MASKED MAN
D: No. I am working here.
N: Sanborn looks at him. Doesn't reply. James puts his gun up on the guy. Now Eldridge does too. This guy is about to be toast. When... A face appears next to him.
C: FACE
D: He's with me.
N: Guns cover the face... Then they see that above the face is a helmet... And on the top of the helmet is a COLONEL'S INSIGNIA.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Okay fellas?
C: JAMES
D: Sorry, Sir. I didn't recognize you.
N: Guns are lowered, fast. Now that the Colonel is fully visible in the light we can see that he's shaken by the scene of destruction around him.
C: COLONEL REED
D: We haven't found a body so it could be a suicide bomber or some clever bastard that caused all this -- and slipped away to sip tea with his mommie -- we just don't know.
N: As the Colonel struggles to define the horror he's just seen, James jumps in to save him:
C: JAMES
D: We'll take a close look, Sir.
C: COLONEL REED
D: This kind of situation we may never know what happened. This is a mass casualty situation - terrible destruction.
C: JAMES
D: Roger that, Sir. We'll do our best.
N: A stretcher comes by.
C: COLONEL REED
D: They're cowards, you know. I wish they would stand up and fight us, man to man, instead of playing hide and seek with me.
C: JAMES
D: Roger, Sir. We better get moving.
C: COLONEL REED
D: Right, go ahead Sergeant.
N: The Colonel nods and moves off. His translator stands for a moment. Takes off his ski mask to reveal an intelligent face with deep set eyes and a dirty smear of five o'clock shadow.
C: SKI MASKED MAN
D: I'm Ahmed. My name is Ahmed. Thank you for not shooting me.
N: The men move on... Advancing toward the plume of smoke and embers rising into the sky...smell of burning rubber and charred metal... ...until they see it -- --the twisted steel carcasses of two small vehicles and a TANKER. The image is biblical - the wounded and dead piled together in one Hieronymus Bosch maze of tangled limbs, body parts... Palm trees burning at the top...like Olympic torches. SOLDIERS secure the area. GRIEVING FAMILIES swarm around the dead and dying -- James, Sanborn and Eldridge approach. Wind fans nearby flames into a fountain of embers that float up into the black desert night. James moves through charred metal, stumbling over something sharp. -- then something hits his leg... What? Flashlight, gun -- DOWN! -- it's a CHICKEN, charred -- feathers burned off but still walking around - disoriented, dying... James stumbles sideways to avoid the charred hens... SOUNDS distant and near of wailing, MEDICS racing onto the SCENE -- A WOMAN wearing Bhurka appears out of the distant flames and haze -- looking disoriented, in apparent state of shock -- SANBORN A BODY lies trapped beneath a pile of rubble. Sanborn reaches down to remove one of the chunks of stone. It slides away, but another falls in its place. ELDRIDGE Shines his light on a concrete wall, stained with what looks like threads of black lace. He draws closer. What is it? Sanborn leans in.
C: SANBORN
D: It's hair.
N: JAMES Approaches the woman in the Bhurka --
C: JAMES
D: Hey! Hey -- you alright? -- Keef Halek?
N: She turns to face him...madness in her eyes. James' flashlight illuminates a massive crater, black...and empty. Eldridge swirls around.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: James?!
E: CALLING
C: JAMES
D: Hey, I'm right here.
N: James is shining his light into a orange tree. There's a PERFECTLY formed ORANGE, unharmed, nestled among the burnt leaves.
C: JAMES
D: This is where the blast stopped. Look over there.
E: beat
N: James is pointing to a building in the distance. It's past a row of houses and a field. Sanborn comes into view. James nods to him and points again.
C: JAMES
D: Perfect vantage point for a remote det -- and I bet he's out there right now watching us make fools of ourselves. We could get him.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You want to go out there?
N: James keeps looking into the distance.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah, let's go hunting.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: I could stand to get in some trouble.
N: Sanborn stares at James and the bandage on his head.
C: SANBORN
D: No.
C: JAMES
D: No?
C: SANBORN
D: Man, this is bullshit. You got -- what?-- three infantry platoons here. That's their job.
C: JAMES
D: You don't say No to me, Sergeant. I say No to you -- and I'm not going to let this bomber slink off while the grunts get their act together.
E: FIERCELY MORE
C: JAMES
D: Let's go. Now.
E: CONT'D on the move
N: James glowers at Sanborn and Eldridge and stomps off, down the alley toward an empty field. Eldridge shoots Sanborn a sympathetic glance, and follows James. Sanborn watches them recede into the darkness. Sanborn runs after them. FIELD They move three abreast across a dark field, guns raised commando-style. Poised to strike. They walk in silence, alert to every decibel. Gravel underfoot. Enveloping night. They come to a high wall, behind which the ground raises to a gentle hill that looks out onto the tanker. WALL Sanborn gives James a leg up over the wall. James helps Sanborn over. They lean over to pull Eldridge up but with the forty pounds of gear he's got on he's too heavy.
C: JAMES
D: You got to work on your pull ups.
N: James and Sanborn drop over the other side, and we follow them as they crouch low and approach a building construction site. WALL Eldridge pushes his back against the wall and scans the area. It dawns on him that he's alone. CONSTRUCTION SITE Sanborn and James come to the edge of the site and find what may or may not be the remains of the trigger man's camp. There's a florescent lantern still glowing and cigarette butts in a pile.
C: JAMES
D: That little bastard. Let's torch this spot so he can't use it again.
N: James pats his pockets down, looking for something.
C: JAMES
D: Do you have an incendiary?
C: SANBORN
D: No.
N: Three quick SHOTS ring out -- they sound very close. Sanborn and James instinctively fall to one knee. They scan the area -- nothing. As one man, they rise and start running back to the wall.
C: JAMES
D: Eldridge!!!
N: There's no answer. WALL
C: SANBORN
D: He's gone.
N: They both drop to the ground on the other side. They scan the ground with their flashlights. The BODY of an Iraqi insurgent is lying close to where Eldridge had been standing. He's pulped from bullet wounds, and gasping for breath.
C: JAMES
D: This guy comes out of the dark - Eldridge shoots.
N: He scavenges the ground looking for brass casings. Nothing.
C: SANBORN
D: Three shots, close range. He takes a step forward to see what he's hit.
C: JAMES
D: Another guy comes from behind him -- gets the drop on him. You're a hostage.
N: They look up and down the wall.
C: SANBORN
D: That way is towards the tanker, troops.
N: DARK STREET They run about fifty yards when Sanborn TRIPS, stumbles, James catches him as he falls, and they keep going. In the distance, they see Eldridge's back and the backs of two other MEN, just as they are turning a corner. They SPRINT to the corner, and pause to catch their breath as James hands Sanborn his flashlight.
C: JAMES
D: Hit `em with both lights on three.
C: SANBORN
D: Fuck. Okay.
C: JAMES
D: One. Two.
N: Sanborn shoulders his rifle and readies both spotlights.
C: JAMES
D: Three.
N: They spin around the corner - flash of light revealing NOTHING but an empty street. They sprint to the next block, where Eldridge is being walked quickly at gun point. The men's rifles are at his head.
C: JAMES
D: Again. One two three. Do it. Do it.
N: Sanborn shines the lights on the backs of both men. James fires. Three shots at the guy on the left of Eldridge. Three shots at the guy on the right. Sanborn kills the flashlights. James goes running towards the group, Sanborn running next to him. Both have their guns up but lights off. They get to the group and all three men are on the ground. Both Iraqis are dead -- shot clean in the back. Eldridge is bleeding profusely from his leg, but he's alive. James and Sanborn pick Eldridge up and drudge back with him.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Am I dead?
C: JAMES
D: No. You're fine.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Am I dead? Am I dead? Am I dead?
N: Off James' face --
S: INT CAMP VICTORY SHOWER STALLS LATER THAT NIGHT
N: James walks in. The room is empty. Florescent lights hum. James is still wearing his fatigues. His whole midsection is red with Eldridge's blood. James heads to the shower and steps inside, fully clothed. He turns on the water. Aims the shower head to his stomach. Sinks down so it can hit the bloody stains. As the uniform grows wet, then gets soaked, the pinkish water swirls down the drain --
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY FIRST SERGEANT'S TRAILER
N: James and Sanborn emerge into the wind.
C: SANBORN
D: So how you doing with this?
C: JAMES
D: Fine. I'm fine.
C: SANBORN
D: Fine? You know I lied to our sergeant.
E: MORE
C: SANBORN
D: So Eldridge wouldn't have to go around saying he was shot by his own team leader.
E: CONT'D
C: JAMES
D: Yeah. Thanks. I'm just tired.
C: SANBORN
D: You want some sleeping pills?
C: JAMES
D: Nah, I'm good.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY HEAD SHED MORNING
N: James walks purposely out of the head shed toward a waiting Humvee. He passes Pele who looks up and shouts:
C: PELE
D: Hey, Boomala, Boomala!
N: James keeps walking. Eyes straight ahead.
C: PELE
D: HEY--
N: Running up to James, holding DVD's, walks next to him.
C: PELE
D: Look at these, best quality. No special effects!
E: SMILING
N: James just keeps walking. He gets in the car, Sanborn in the driver's seat. Pele watches him go. Hurt.
S: EXT CAMP VICTORY TARMAC MORNING
N: Eldridge is on a stretcher, being loaded into a military transport helicopter. Sanborn and James are there to say good- bye. As Eldridge is being loaded in, James touches his shoulder.
C: JAMES
D: You'll probably be walking in a few months.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: My tibia is shattered in nine places I don't think I'm going to be walking soon. The doc said six months if I'm lucky.
C: JAMES
D: Wow. Six ain't bad.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Not bad? It fucking sucks man.
N: Eldridge is jostled as he gets put down. And he cries out in pain.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You see that motherfucker. That's what happens when you shoot somebody.
E: ANGRILY
C: JAMES
D: I'm sorry.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You're sorry? Fuck you, Will. Really fuck you. Thanks for saving my life and all but we didn't have to go hunting for the trigger man. You invented it, to get your adrenaline fix. You war mongering fuck.
E: meaning it
N: James is stunned.
C: SANBORN
D: Take care of yourself, Owen.
E: grabbing Eldridge's hand
N: A TRANSPORT SOLDIER looks at Sanborn and gives a hand signal to wrap it up. Time to go. The door is closed on Eldridge. James and Sanborn watch as the helicopter takes off. The rotor wash chops the air. JAMES Wind and sand buffet his face. He turns to say something to Sanborn. But he's already walking away.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BAGHDAD STREET LATE AFTERNOON
N: A new sand storm has begun. And so it's in a cloud of dusty orange air that we find James, encased in his bomb suit, taking the first steps of his trek towards... DOWNRANGE A WASHING MACHINE. Sitting in the middle of the street. TITLE OVER: DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 5 UPRANGE Sanborn casts a nervous look around the poverty-stricken neighborhood. It has taken on a forboding vibe in the unrelenting storm. DOWNRANGE James approaches the washing machine.
C: JAMES
D: I hear ticking.
E: headset, impish grin
N: He uses a long pole to open the door of the washing machine. It's empty inside. Getting closer, he sees the washing machine timer is at 30 minutes. James rests his head on the timer, listening. He turns his attention to the back of the washing machine, unscrewing the rear plate. Inside, just a tangle of wires. He traces the wires with his hand. Shrugs. Then he turns back to the front of the machine. He twists the timer with his hand, slowly, all the way back to zero. It DINGS -- harmlessly.
C: JAMES
D: Hey, Sanborn.
E: HEADSET
C: SANBORN
D: Copy. What's up?
E: OVER WALKIE
C: JAMES
D: Send your skivvies down here on the bot, I'll run a quick bleach cycle. Somebody threw out a perfectly good washing machine.
E: OVER WALKIE
N: UPRANGE
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that.
E: RELIEVED
N: --When, suddenly, the SOUND of SOLDIERS SHOUTING in the distance catches Sanborn's ear.
C: SANBORN
D: Hustle back, something's going on.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: MOMENTS LATER James comes back sweating profusely from his run. Sanborn helps take his helmet off. As two SOLDIERS come running over. More SHOUTING in the distance, louder now. "Hands on your head." "Don't move asshole." "Stop. Stop." In addition, the sound of SHOUTING IN ARABIC. A loud jumble. Over that, SOLDIERS YELLING: "Get back." "Form a perimeter." A NERVOUS SOLDIER trots up to James and Sanborn.
C: JAMES
D: What's going on?
C: NERVOUS SOLDIER
D: We've got a situation with a suicide bomber.
C: JAMES
D: We'll follow you.
N: They follow the soldier down the road. The soldier is sweating, terrified.
S: EXT BAGHDAD ROAD
N: The road has been cordoned off by SOLDIERS on all sides. In the middle of the road an IRAQI MAN IN A NEW BLACK SUIT is standing with his hands above his head. He's distraught. Hair mussed. A SERGEANT seems to have taken command of the situation, and now he alone is shouting to the man. "Stay still. Don't Move. If you keep walking we will shoot you." A TRANSLATOR in a black ski mask is helping him get the message across. The translator edges forward to talk to the BLACK SUIT man.
C: SERGEANT
D: Keep that translator back.
N: One of the soldiers grabs the translator.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: But the bomb was forced on him. Against his will. He is not a bad man!
E: to the soldier
N: James and Sanborn and the NERVOUS SOLDIER come onto the scene. The Sergeant turns to James and explains.
C: SERGEANT
D: He came walking up to our checkpoint, said he had a bomb strapped to him. He was sorry. He didn't want it to blow up. He begged us to take it off him.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: Help this man. He's not a bad man.
E: TO JAMES
C: SANBORN
D: Not a bad man? You've got to be kidding me. This is a trap. He wants to draw people close to him.
E: TO JAMES
C: JAMES
D: Tell him to open his jacket. I need to see the bomb.
E: TO TRANSLATOR
N: The translator SHOUTS in Arabic and the MAN unbuttons his jacket, revealing several sticks of dynamite strapped to his chest.
C: JAMES
D: With that much bang, I'd need a hundred meter perimeter. Tell him to get on his knees.
E: to the soldier TO TRANSLATOR
N: The translator SHOUTS. BLACK SUIT complies.
C: SERGEANT
D: Can we just shoot him?
N: As James considers that option when --
C: TRANSLATOR
D: NO. He's not a bad man. He has a family. The bomb was forced on him. He is asking for help. Only help.
C: JAMES
D: I want you one hundred meters away, like everybody else.
E: TO TRANSLATOR
C: TRANSLATOR
D: But how will I hear?
C: JAMES
D: You don't need to. I'm going down there.
N: Meanwhile, the BLACK SUIT man is SHOUTING something in Arabic.
C: JAMES
D: What the fuck is he shouting now?
E: TO TRANSLATOR
C: TRANSLATOR
D: He's asking you to hurry. He thinks the bomb has a timer on it.
N: James turns to Sanborn
C: JAMES
D: Where's that helmet?
N: Sanborn pulls James aside.
C: SANBORN
D: We've had our differences. Eldridge? That's water under the bridge. It happened. But this -- this is suicide.
N: James smiles at Sanborn. He just doesn't get it.
C: JAMES
D: That's why it's called a suicide bomb.
C: SANBORN
D: It's suicide for you, Will.
C: JAMES
D: Nah. That guy wants to catch an American? I'll give him an American.
N: Sanborn reluctantly hands him his helmet, and seals him in. James grabs a nearby soldier's walkie then starts the walk downrange. Soldiers moving back to their perimeter. PEDESTRIANS gathering for a look. Soldiers scattering them quickly. BLACK SUIT Smiles thinly as James nears. James nods at him. The man nods, frightened.
C: BLACK SUIT
D: Inshalla. Inshalla.
C: JAMES
D: Uh-huh.
N: James kneels down to get a closer look at the bomb strapped to the man's belly. He takes out his 9mm and puts it on the guy's forehead. Cocks the trigger.
C: JAMES
D: If I shoot you now, I can disarm this bomb much more easily. Do you understand?
N: BLACK SUIT stares at him blankly.
C: JAMES
D: Sanborn, give your walkie to the translator.
E: HEADSET
C: TRANSLATOR
D: Yes?
E: OVER WALKIE
C: JAMES
D: What the hell is this guy saying?
E: HEADSET
N: BLACK SUIT jabbers on in Arabic. UPRANGE The translator keys his walkie.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: He says, I don't wish to die. I have a family. Please take this off me.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: JAMES Holds his walkie up for the man to hear the translator.
C: JAMES
D: Hands have to stay behind his head or I will be very happy to shoot him.
E: HEADSET
N: Translator conveys this to BLACK SUIT in Arabic. BLACK SUIT starts yelling in Arabic. Forehead wet with sweat.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: He says, please hurry he has a family.
E: OVER WALKIE
C: JAMES
D: That's not what I asked you. Now I'm going to shoot if he doesn't understand that he can't move his hands.
E: TO TRANSLATOR
N: James holds the walkie up to the man's ear. Translator has another exchange.
C: BLACK SUIT
D: Yes. Yes. Yes!
N: Now James sinks to his knees and examines the bomb, all the while keeping his pistol on the man's head. There is a FOREST OF WIRES. He pushes them aside, revealing a cheap Casio digital WATCH, which is counting down from five minutes.
C: JAMES
D: Sanborn, I need to get this rig off. There's too many wires here to figure it out.
E: HEADSET
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that, what do you need?
E: OVER HEADSET
N: James feels around the bomb. It's strapped to the BLACK SUIT man with heavy gauge metal. The man is shivering with fear.
C: JAMES
D: Bolt cutters.
E: HEADSET
C: SANBORN
D: Copy that. I'll get `em.
E: OVER WALKIE
C: JAMES
D: You've got two minutes to get them and get down here.
E: HEADSET
N: UPRANGE Sanborn is already running towards the truck when he hears James.
C: SANBORN
D: Fuck. Copy that.
E: INTO WALKIE
N: DOWNRANGE James presses his pistol harder into the man's forehead.
C: JAMES
D: Don't move.
E: TO MAN
N: UPRANGE Sanborn runs to the truck. He roots around looking for the bolt cutter. At last he finds it, and comes charging out with it. DOWNRANGE The Casio watch is at 4:30. SANBORN Running hard with the bolt cutters. --Past a crew of soldiers. --Down the road, sprinting now. Rifle flapping. DOWNRANGE Sanborn skids to a halt, hands James the cutters. James hands his gun to Sanborn, who holds it on the man's forehead. James sets to work, applying the cutters to the thick metal holding the bomb to his chest. The man is crying now. Sanborn sees the Casio. It reads 4:00
C: SANBORN
D: Holy shit. You weren't kidding.
C: JAMES
D: Nope.
T: James works the cutter blade.
N: CU: Bolt Cutter. It SCRAPS futilely against the metal.
C: JAMES
D: What is this made out of?
E: SOTTO
C: BLACK SUIT
D: Please. Please.
C: SANBORN
D: Case hardened steel.
N: James doubles his effort. CU: Bolt Cutter. The blade bites the steel, but it doesn't give. James squeezes with all his might.
C: JAMES
D: Motherfucker. What's our time?
N: Sanborn looks at the Casio.
C: SANBORN
D: Three minutes.
C: JAMES
D: Shit. Ok. Let me think.
N: He puts the bolt cutter down on the ground.
C: JAMES
D: We'd need an arc welder to get this off properly.
C: SANBORN
D: I don't think we have one of those in the truck.
N: CU: Casio Watch 2:30.
C: JAMES
D: Let's try the back of it.
N: Sanborn nods. Keeps the gun on the man's head. His hand is starting to shake. James goes behind the man, and rips open the back of his shirt, revealing the back of the bomb. Here too it is a welded band, but the metal looks thinner. Weaker. James works it with the cutter. CU: Casio Watch 1:30.
C: SANBORN
D: We have to bail.
C: JAMES
D: Go. I got the suit.
N: Sanborn looks at the guy.
C: SANBORN
D: What do you want me to do with the pistol?
C: JAMES
D: Take it with you, that's a good pistol.
C: SANBORN
D: When do you leave?
C: JAMES
D: In forty five seconds.
N: Sanborn turns, and begins running uprange.
C: SANBORN
D: Get back! Get back!
E: shouting to soldiers
N: The soldiers turn and run. James tries and tries to clip the metal. It's a no go. He comes around to face the man.
C: JAMES
D: I'm sorry.
C: BLACK SUIT
D: Please, please.
C: JAMES
D: The metal is too thick.
C: BLACK SUIT
D: Help me. Help me!
N: James drops the bolt cutter, kneels down in front of the man, and shakes his head. That's it. The man understands James' gesture. He reaches forward, grabbing James' suit.
C: BLACK SUIT
D: No! No!
N: James clubs his hand away.
C: JAMES
D: Sorry.
N: CU: Casio Watch: 45 seconds. James gets up and starts running-- lumbers, really, in the suit -- as fast as he can towards a retreating Sanborn. Sanborn hears James' boots thumping towards him and cranes his neck to see --James running, arms akimbo --The Black Suit man stands up BOOM!! -- He explodes and the blast spits out fire and dust. --James is nailed with shrapnel and debris, knocked over. --Sanborn is blown to the ground. JAMES POV --through the helmet a hailstorm of particulate matter flying at 22,000 feet per second straight at us -- --chunks of molten metal hitting his stomach, stopped by the SUIT --bits of shrapnel and body parts thump into him --dust and blood splatters the outside of his helmet JAMES --CU his face: White. No movement. Total silence. --blood seeps from his nose --then, as if overcoming great resistance, his heart turns over -- Daaaa--duuuunk --sharp, loud inhale of breath. Like birth. The heart kicks in again. Da-dunk. Da-dunk. James struggles to stand. He looks uprange. Sanborn is staggering towards the soldiers.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT HUMVEE DUSK
N: The Humvee snakes along the desert floor. Traffic thickening. Shadows against a dimming sky.
S: INT HUMVEE
N: Sanborn is in the passenger seat, shivering, and covered in grime and dust. James, in the driver's seat. James looks over at Sanborn.
C: JAMES
D: You alright?
C: SANBORN
D: No. I hate this place
N: Sanborn stares out the window at the unforgiving landscape. James passes Sanborn some Gatorade.
C: JAMES
D: Have a hit.
N: Sanborn drinks, grateful, and puts the Gatorade down. Then he looks at James.
C: SANBORN
D: I'm not ready to die, man.
C: JAMES
D: Bro, you're not going to die out here.
N: Sanborn shakes his head. Unconsciously, his fingers touch his neck, finding the exposed area above the collar of his body armor.
C: SANBORN
D: Another inch or two difference. Shrapnel goes zing . Severs my throat. I bleed out in the sand. Fuck. If I die now, nobody will even really care. My folks, sure. But that don't count. Who else? I don't even have a son.
E: still touching his neck BEAT BEAT
C: JAMES
D: You got time.
C: SANBORN
D: No... I'm done. I want a son, Will. I want a son.
N: They drive on in silence. Then Sanborn looks at James, as if seeing him for the first time.
C: SANBORN
D: Why do you do it? Take the risks?
C: JAMES
D: Hell, I don't know.
C: SANBORN
D: But you know what I'm talking about, right? Every time we go out, you throw the dice. Live or die, you just throw `em down. You recognize that, right?
N: Beat.
C: JAMES
D: Yeah. I do. But I don't know why. Do you know why I am the way I am?
E: softly
C: SANBORN
D: No, Will, I don't.
N: Silence. Then after a while:
C: JAMES
D: This traffic is pissing me off.
C: SANBORN
D: Where are we, anyway?
C: JAMES
D: I know where I am but I'm lost.
N: They drive on. Dust off the desert floor blows into the WINDSHIELD --
T: TIME CUT TO:
S: INT KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE SUPERMARKET DAY
N: A big one. Vast, hyper-hygenic, the aisles stretching on, loaded with glistening produce. Muzac. A cathedral to consumerism. We find James walking through the supermarket, looking like a new man. His hair has grown, softening his features. He's scrubbed clean, dust free, and dressed in Bermuda shorts and a clashing Polo shirt. The All American Dad. A suburban softie. Pushing a shopping cart. Welcome home, son, for you are no longer in Baghdad. You're in the "big PX" -- America. A beautiful young WOMAN approaches him from the other end of the aisle. She too, is pushing a shopping cart, and in it is a small BOY. She smiles at James, and says:
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: Honey, you grab the barbecue sauce and I'll meet you in aisle four.
N: And CONNIE JAMES smiles again, and pats her husband on the shoulder. Now James knows he's really home. JAMES Pushes the cart over to the sauce section. Down the squeaky- clean aisle. His progress is impeded by an OBESE WOMAN who is mulling over cat litter. Her overflowing cart blocks the aisle. James stops. Hands tight on the shopping cart. He looks at her hard. She ignores him. Where's the 9mm when you need it? James clears his throat. She sees him. Moves her cart. He continues on, walking through the cavernous space. At last, he's at the sauce section. He is rattled by the abundance after the bleakness of Iraq, and the array of choices is dizzying. --He reaches for a bottle, then pulls back, unsure. --Giving up, he picks a bottle at random and tosses it into the cart.
S: INT KNOXVILLE JAMES HOUSE KITCHEN MORNING SOME DAYS LATER
N: James is washing the vegetables they've just bought at the grocery store. Mushrooms bob in a pool of water at the bottom of the sink. James tries to clean them individually, but can't. They crumble in his hands.
C: CONNIE
D: Let's put the chicken on first and the vegetables on last, so they don't burn?
N: James struggles with the mushrooms. Makes no reply.
C: CONNIE CONT'D
D: Will?
C: JAMES
D: Yeah, okay. You know, they're really short on bomb techs over there.
E: beat
N: Connie knows where this is going, but she fights the inevitable.
C: CONNIE
D: Well, good thing the army is hiring, and they've got so many great guys over there.
C: JAMES
D: Uh-huh.
N: James wipes his hands on the dish towel and walks out. Looking at his retreating back, she accidentally knocks a glass off the counter, and it shatters.
S: EXT JAMES HOUSE LATER THAT DAY
N: A few NEIGHBORS have gathered for a barbecue in James' backyard. It's a simple, low-key affair. James is tending meat on a grill.
S: INT JAMES HOUSE CONTINUOUS
N: The doorbell rings. Connie rushes to open it. It's Sanborn. She hugs him.
C: CONNIE
D: Thanks for coming. Maybe he'll listen to you.
C: SANBORN
D: I know how to talk to him.
S: EXT JAMES HOUSE A LITTLE LATER
N: Behind the barbecue, Sanborn finds a moment to confront James privately.
C: SANBORN
D: What the fuck is the matter with you? You got a family, kid, nice looking burgers.
N: James studies the grilling meat.
C: JAMES
D: I know, it's crazy. So how's life at home treating you?
N: Sanborn holds up his hand. He's wearing a wedding ring.
C: SANBORN
D: I made the plunge. But I thought we were talking about you.
E: big smile
C: JAMES
D: We just did, buddy.
S: INT JAMES' SON'S BEDROOM LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The boy is in a cradle, face up and wide awake. James comes in to tuck him in. James pulls a book of fairy tales off the shelf, flips through it. Can't read that fluff. He pulls up a chair. Begins to play with a Jack-In-the-Box. He winds it up. He opens it for his son. The Jack POPs out. His son squeals with delight, then his eyes go wide with fear. He's not sure what to make of the bobbing clown.
C: JAMES
D: (trying to settle him
C: DOWN)
D: Well, let's see. I bet you don't know the story of these magic boxes.
N: James looks at the box. He stuffs the Jack back in and closes it. The boy looks up at him with a son's pure admiration. Rapt.
C: JAMES
D: Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there were many magic BOXES
N: He stops to think.
C: JAMES
D: Every person had a magic box. But you couldn't tell they were magic boxes on the outside. Like this one.
N: He brings the box close to the child's eyes. The boy is dazzled by the colors. He reaches out to touch it.
C: JAMES
D: It just looks like a plain old box. Then a new king came along and told all the people, you have to give me all your magic boxes. But the people, instead of giving away their boxes decided to hide them. And they put their boxes in secret places all over the kingdom. They put them in the roads. They put them in cars. They put them in buildings. And the King said, "Well, how am I going to get my magic boxes now?" And one of the King's men said, "We have a special Knight with special armor, and he can find the boxes. And only he.
E: does a King's gravelly baritone
N: He tries to collect his thoughts.
C: JAMES
D: And this Knight gathered up all the boxes, far and wide. And sometimes - - when he wasn't sure if it was a magic box -- he opened them.
N: James slowly opens the box, holding the clown in with his hand so it doesn't pop. Releasing it slowly. The boy giggles and reaches up.
C: JAMES
D: And the King said to the Knight, you have done a wonderful job. I will grant you one wish. What do you wish?
N: James thinks, struggles to find an ending.
C: JAMES
D: But the Knight didn't know what to say.
N: James realizes he can't finish the story.
C: JAMES
D: You see, the thing is, son. One day you'll understand that when you start out like you are now, you love everything. You love your Mommy and your Daddy. You love your bobba. You love your blanket.
E: MORE
C: JAMES
D: You even love your little crib, and these dumb toys. But as you get older some of the things you love don't seem special anymore. That bobba is one day just going to look like an ordinary plastic bottle to you. And the older you get, the more this happens and the fewer things you love. And by the time you get to be my age, sometimes you only love one -- or two -- things.
E: CONT'D
N: James pauses.
C: JAMES
D: With me, I think's it's one.
S: EXT KNOXVILLE BUS STOP DAWN
N: James waits for the bus. Wearing his camo. He's alone. His hair is shaved again. The far off city BUS grinds its gears. James turns toward the sound when a Chevy PICKUP pulls ahead of the bus, and zooms to a stop in front of him.
S: INT PICKUP
N: Sanborn opens the passenger window.
S: EXT BUS STOP
C: JAMES
D: You lost again, Sergeant?
C: SANBORN
D: Get in, before I change my mind.
N: They drive away.
S: INT PICKUP
C: SANBORN
D: Couldn't risk letting you on a public bus. Probably shoot the damn driver if it wasn't moving fast enough.
E: SMILING
S: INT AIRPLANE
N: A stewardess passing out glasses of water and packages of peanuts approaches James' aisle.
C: STEWARDESS
D: Here you are, Sir Thank you for your service.
E: noticing James' uniform
C: JAMES
D: Your welcome, m'am.
N: The stewardess smiles lovingly, and waits for an opening to continue the conversation. When none comes, she moves on. James turns to the window. In his hand he holds a photo of his son. Tears well up. The plane's ENGINE WHINE swells and merges with--
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BAGHDAD DAY
N: --SONIC OVERLOAD: Angry drivers SHOUT in Arabic - car HORNS blare - loudspeaker CALL to prayer - Humvee RUMBLE - incoming CHOPPER WASH - RAT- TAT-TAT of distant gunfire -- As James' feet hit the tarmac. A SOLDIER is waiting for him, with a smile on his face.
C: SOLDIER
D: Welcome to Delta-Company.
N: A Middle-Eastern sun bathes James' upturned face lengthening into a smile. His pace slows...the tarmac transitions to dirt as little puffs of dust lift off his continuous passage. He is now in the bomb suit and we are --
S: EXT. BAGHDAD OUTSKIRTS DAY
N: -- in the desert. The small CLUSTER of SOLDIERS at the side of the road parts to make way for James. Hands pat his back as he begins the long walk down the street -- toward the bomb. All SOUND telescopes down to just James' BREATHING... --the view through James' eyes: the outside world of soldiers and Baghdad seems to pulsate with excitement -- -- James' face. As the SOUNDS of his breathing grow louder -- The noon day sun beats brilliantly onto a car's windshield, the glass shimmering. TITLE OVER: DAYS LEFT IN DELTA COMPANY'S ROTATION: 365 -- James moves into the path of that reflected sunlight. -- And vanishes into the glare. END
