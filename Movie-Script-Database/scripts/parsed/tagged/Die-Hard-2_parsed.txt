S: EXT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY
N: JOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a "GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD" sign on the rear window.
C: MCCLANE

C: COP
D: So Ask Santa to bring you another car.
N: MCCLANE (SOTTO) You son of a - BEEP drowns out his last word. McClave sweeps aside his coat, finds the beeper on his belt. He looks at the obviously unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement, then runs into the terminal.
S: INT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY
N: CHRISTMAS MUSIC wafting through the building from a SCHOOL CHOIR perched in front of a massive, three-story window. Blase travelers PAUSE in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic voices. McClane shoves his way through some people - when they GLARE at him he quickly APPLAUDS the kids, pulls up at an INFORMATION BOOTH - the girl there is watching a LITTLE TV on the shelf out of sight from the public.
C: MCCLANE 1ST NEWSCASTER

S: EXT. AIRPORT - THROUGH WINDOW - SAME TIME
N: A plane TAKES OFF. We PULL BACK and realize we're in a MOTEL ROOM. The TV is on and we SEE the TV PICTURE CHANGE to a TROPICAL AIRFIELD. Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and leg chains is hustled aboard a plane.
C: 2ND NEWSCASTER
D: Security was tight today at Escalon airport in the Republic of Val Verde, where government authorities escorted General Ramon Esperanza to the military transport that will bring him to the United States to stand trial for narcotics trafficking. A HAND thrusts in front of the CAMERA - FINGERS clenching and curling oddly.
C: WIDER
D: A half naked MAN is doing Tai Ch'i EXERCISES. This is COLONEL WILLIAM STUART, U.S.A. His body is hard, with SCARS from knives and bullets. On the TV, the words "FILE TAPE" blink under Esperanza's IMAGE,. here resplendent in a Latin American uniform, reviewing troops in the field and then moving to a table under a tarp to sign documents with American military officers. He hands a COLONEL the pen just used on the document - a souvenir.
E: Ret.

C: DISTINCTIVE CHRISTTMAS WRAP.
D: Stewart puts on the shirt. In the pocket is a PEN - the same pen we just saw on TV. If we haven't realized it yet, we realize it now; t s is the same man.91 Suddenly Stuart WHIRLS like a GUNFIGHTER. But all he's got in his hand is the remote control, snatched from the nightstand.

And now we SEE THEM - ten more TALL, HARD men, all coming into the hallway from their adjoining rooms within seconds of each other, all carrying SIMILAR GIFT WRAPPED PACKAGES. They get into two adjoining. elevators, the stark LIGHTS above their heads and their unmoving expressions making them look like Aliens ready to beam up. As the doors CLOSE we

N: HOLLY MCCLANE is here, AirPhone at her ear and a beautiful SUNSET over the plane's wing visible through the nearby window. With the Compaq portable computer, filofax and calculator piled on it, Holly'.s seat back table looks like a traveling office.
C: MCCLANE
D: Hello. This is Lieutenant McClane - Somebody there beep me?
C: HOLLY
D: I'd like to think I'm somebody.
C: MCCLANE
D: Holly! Did you land?

C: HOLLY
D: We're going to land about thirty minutes late, I wanted you to know. Kids okay?
C: MCCLANE
D: Just speeding on sugar, thanks to your parents. I really appreciate you coming a day late, honey. Nothing I like better than a weekend with the Munsters.
C: HOLLY
D: Mom give you any trouble about borrowing her new car?
N: MCCLANE (CAREFULLY) No... not yet. Uh...how 'bout if when you land, we don't drive over the river and through the woods to Grandma's house, but check into the Airport motel?

T: CUT TO:
N: A LITTLE SEMI-RURAL CHURCH - NEAR THE AIRPORT Charming until the SUB WOOFER ROAR of a big jet SCREAMS by, practically in the little church's backyard. Now we notice that the church is a little run down - trim needing paint, sidewalk cracked - and a neat SIGN confirms our SUSPICIONS: "FUTURE SITE OF PARISH DAY CARE CENTER. WORSHIP WITH US AT OUR NEW CHURCH, 52 KENSINGTON ROAD, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA." A DWP VAN pulls up, snow tires CRUNCHING on the driveway here. Two MEN (BAKER and THOMPSON) get out in official DWP wardrobe. But we remember the trim bodies, trimmer hair... and we remember those gift wrapped packages, - which one of these guys carries.
C: INSIDE THE CHURCH
D: On a TV here, the newscast CONTINUES, now back to the tropical airport. Esperanza is at the top of the steps, waving to the press like a triumphant hero - not a felon en route to prison. The plane doors close and it taxis down the runway. WIDEN from the set, which an elderly CUSTODIAN is watching while he eats some instant soup. The DOORBELL RINGS. The custodian answers it.

D: The three men walk down the main aisle of the church. Dust motes dance in the colored light.
C: CUSTODIAN
D: Don't seem right, somehow, closing a church down. Oh, I know the parish is gonna keep using it, but it won't be the same. Been here a lot of years; and I been right here with it. They've arrived at a rear window. FOCUS CHANGE to a green CONDUIT BOX on the the church's rear lawn, half covered in snow. FOCUS back through the glass. Thompson looks questioningly at Baker, who nods.
C: CUSTODIAN
D: Yep. I kinda feel a part of me is dying along with this church.

Thompson, meanwhile, takes out a very futuristic transceiver. He turns it ON; getting a RED light; enters a NUMBER CODE on the keypad and gets a GREEN LIGHT. There's an EERIE QUALITY to the transmission.
C: THOMPSON
D: This is team one. We're here.
C: NEWSCASTER

Quickly, they OPEN the trunk - slide, out a long OLIVE DRAB TUBE and a TRIPOD.

S: INT. DULLES TOWER - "THE CAB" - DAY
N: The top of the Tower, it's the heart, soul, brain of Dulles. We HEAR snatches of AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL as the CAMERA PANS the big room. We SEE PLANES outside, the airport LIGHTS already on against the grey of the snow. It's damn impressive. CONTINUED (X) CONTINUED - 0' CAMERA SETTLES on TRUDEAU. Chief Air Traffic controller, he's lived through hijackings, the Olympics, Reagan's mass firings -and he's still going (heart bypass notwithstanding.)

S: INT. AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT
N: WIDEN from McClane at the bar, his coat on a stool beside him. He's on his second scotch. On the BAR TV, we SEE SAMANTHA ("SAM") COPELAND, a reporter with "live" super'd over her body. She is clearly somewhere inside this airport SAM (ON TV) --here at Dulles, the quiet men from the Justice Department wait to put handcuffs on the man who has come to symbolize the enemy in America's fight against cocaine... This battle may be almost won... but the war is still in doubt. Samantha Copeland... . WNTW for NightTime News. CAMERA ADJUSTS to.show a MAN as he OPENS a PHONE BOOTH. It's very quick, but we REALIZE that while in there he. wasn't using the phone but one of the transceivers we saw before. This is MAJOR GARBER, Stuart's second-in-command; but his efficiency and chilly courage are second to none. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM to a TABLE.

He walks right past McClane, who doesn't notice him. A beat after Mil ergs exit, two AIRPORT COPS in snow-flecked JACKETS come into the bar. Seeing, them, the bartender is already pouring coffee for them. But-
C: GARBER AND COCHRANE
D: also see the cops - and very casually, Cochrane ulls the earplug from his ear. Equally casually, Garber Vs-Wed-If-is- foot to slide the two long Christmas package at his feet under the table.
N: ON MCCLANE - CAMERA PUSH This gets his attention. His eyes narrow. He looks from the two or d inary looking men towards the Airport cops, wonders why they got fidgety. Now he watches GARBER & Q HRANE who looks at his watch, signals Cochrane. Both rise. But as Cochrane bends to pick up his wrapped package... and as he moves, something dangles inside his jacket. Is it a holster?

N: Dark. Clatters and bumps, machine sounds... more bumps. McClane moves cautiously along. He JUMPS as a large SHADOW moves nearby, but it's a big CASE on a conveyor belt. Now, he stoops to go under another conveyor belt - the different tracks intersect and pass each other like freeway off-ramps discharging luggage from one to another - and then he SEES - (X) 39A COCHRANE AND MILLER 39A One has his jacket off, and just now dusts off his hands like a man finishing a job. The other one has one of those transceivers.

C: BELOW
D: The gun CLATTERS on the floor. Seeing it, the two men exchange a glance - split up.
C: MCCLANE
D: Drops from the belt, crouches near big gears. Desperate, he looks around for a weapon, anything. Then he notices all the luggage going past: Suitcases, camera cases, a bicycle... Skis.

McClane LEAPS like Tarzan to the BOTTOM of the i , empty "return" belt - the momentum swings him right towards Cochrane, who FIRES once more before McClane's KICK nearly toc e stf'his head - he loses the gun, but Jesus, these guys are tough and now Cochrane LEAPS UP and grabs McClane's belt and clothes and they're both hanging -suddenly they're both too damn high to get off!

C: UP AHEAD
D: The belt goes through a hatchway - a hatchway with virtually no clearance.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: McClane PUNCHES Cochrane - again, again - but the guy's gonna kill them both one way or the other - McClane KICKS him, again, again - finally his grip loosens - at the last minute McClane JUMPS to a thick conduit - and then Cochrane gets JAMMED
N: INTO THE HATCH HEADFIRST. NEW ANGLE - 20 FEET UP The conduit BREAKS FREE from its molly bolts, but doesn't drop -and three feet away the guy SCREAMS and then his neck SNAPS and his body TWITCHES AND JERKS and the machinery JAMS, smoking-

S: INT. BASEMENT -- DUCT ACCESS
N: With a cordless drill, Marvin unhinges the access door. Last bolt, it falls with a sheet-metal SLAM. McClane WINCES as a BLAST of AIR hits him - and, as. perspiration breaks out on his forehead, we realize it's hot air.
C: MCCLANE
D: Whoa.
C: MARVIN
D: Winter up there... Summer down here. He aims Marvin's flashlight down there, isn't enchanted with what he sees. He turns, takes Marvin's map.

Our people took out their Swat team... completely.
C: GARBER
D: You were right... they went for the antenna array. We're right on schedule.
C: STUART
D: Except losing our own team wasn't part of the plan. He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the improvised screens and terminals.

D: has reacted to both the mention of his name and of McClane's. His brow furrows. Ah, yes.
C: STUART
D: McClave? John McClane? The... policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages? I read about you in People magazine. You seemed out of your league on Nightline, though...
C: MCCLANE
D: Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous for five minutes. Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV. How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
C: STUART
D: I think Cardinal Richlieu said it best: Treason is merely a matter of dates. And this country has to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off men. like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression.
C: MCCLANE
D: And lesson one starts with killing policemen? What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb?
C: STUART
D: I think we can find something in between. Give me a flight number - one low on fuel. Another man hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, switches to another mike .

Now, he puts all his energy into levering the rifle against the steel. Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.

N: FUEL PORT - UPSIDE DOWN - HIS POV -423 BACK TO SCENE 423 He reaches for it. Too far. Stretches. Gets it - fucker is TIGHT. Wincing, he TURNS it a bit - then LOOKS up just in TIME to SEE STUART, knife whizzing DOWN -
C: NEW ANGLE
D: McClane ROLLS, but the knife CATCHES his SHOULDER. In pain, he manances to KICK Stuart's KNEE - Stuart FALLS, almost goes over the wing - McClane goes back to work on the fuel port -it,TURNS another 1/4 turn -and then he has to abandon it to deal with another CHARGE from Stuart.

C: ESPERANZA
D: sees this, smiles -
N: MCCLANE -AT EDGE OF RUNWAY crawls to a painful sitting position. Face impassive, he watches the jet move away... and - incongrous as it seems - he lights a cigarette, looks off at - (X) THE LINE OF JET FUEL running along the runway for 1/4 mile now -
C: MCCLANE
D: battered like a car wreck victim, now he looks up into the dark sky trying to find the SOUND OF JET ENGINES. Then he SEES -

C: 442C ESPERANZA 442C
D: TURNS at the EXPLOSION in time for a WALL OF FIRE that SHOOTS UP THE WING and through the cockpit FLOOR, and then he's ON FIRE
N: AND THEN

D: Honey... there's your landing lights.
E: towards the sky
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOLLY'S PLANE - COCKPIT
N: Blackness and driven SNOW outside - and then - in an almost cinematic FADE - through the glass we SEE the BURNING WRECKAGE -and, more importantly - the LINE OF FIRE RUNNING CLEAN AND STRAIGHT for almost a mile - A line right along the runway.
C: CO-PILOT
D: Look - ! The pilot grabs controls desperately, trims the plane -
N: IN THE CABIN - The passengers REACT as they level a bit -
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HER PLANE
N: It descends, a bit erratic, but now it's ALONGSIDE the line of fire, coming in from the wrong end of the runway, and then the wheels BOUNCE, once, twice, and then a tire BLOWS but the pilots (X) HOLD IT as it SWERVES and finally SKIDS TO A HALT, turning onto (X) the grassy field. Already we HEAR RESCUE SIRENS. IN THE CAB
C: BARNES
D: One forty is down! They used the fire to see -
E: listening to headset

N: 'EM -
C: TRUDEAU
D: They already know. Listen. And sure enough, there it is - the SOUND of ENGINES -
S: EXT. SKY - LANDING PATTERN
N: And now the lights come down from the sky, in a neat and patient row, the closest-filling the screen, the others dwindling down to the size of stars. MCCLANE - ON THE RUNWAY Stumbles along, maybe thinking he's dead or dreaming... IGNORING the giant PLANE LANDING BESIDE HIM, ignoring the FLAMES beyond that - His concentration is totally on Holly's plane -now another giant PLANE SKIDS down behind him - it's an assembly line, like B-29's coming home from war - then he SEES what he's praying for - breaks into a RUN -
C: MCCLANE
D: Holly - HOLLY -HOLLY!
N: HOLLY - IN PLANE DOOR HEARS this just as she goes down the RESCUE CHUTE, ushed by Stewardess controlling their own tears - (X) ('.. 456 MCCLANE 456 CATCHES her at the bottom like a child - CARRIES HER AWAY. THORNBERG - ON THE GROUND groggy, he raises his hands in supplication to the stewardess. She steps over him, puts her high heels back on - walks off.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE NEWS 'CHOPPER

C: BACK TO SCENE
D: The cameraman brings up his lens.
C: CAMERAMAN
D: God, that's beautiful -
C: SAM
D: Yeah. It sure is. And she yanks out his power cord, watches it dreamily.
N: THE AIRFIELD - NIGHT as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers pour down the steps into arms of friends, families, loved ones.
C: 461A MCCLANE 461A
D: Sets Holly down, kisses her - then both TURN at a HONK. Marvin is there in an airport cart. He looks at the chaos.
C: MARVIN
D: Damned if I'm cleaning up this mess. McClane and Holly get in the cart. Marvin drives them away, light BLINKING... and we PULLBACK until McClane and Holly are just part of the crowd.
N: THE END
