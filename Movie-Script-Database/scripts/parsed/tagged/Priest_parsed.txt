T: FADE IN:
N: THE MOON. So fat and full in the night sky you can reach out and touch it. HICKS W. 0. This is what's known: There has always been man...and there have always been vampires. BLACK SHAPES swoop past the moonscape, vicious looking things. Much shrieking and wailing. Atop a STONE ZIGGURAT -- We see a GROUP OF MEN -- AZTEC WARRIORS readying themselves with PRIMITIVE WEAPONS -- SLINGS, BOWS, SPEARS. Tonight they know they will die.
C: HICKS
D: Since the beginning -- the two have been locked forever in combat... The vampires were quicker, stronger and had the gift of flight. Quick glimpses of a bloody, brutal battle. Men screaming. Talons ripping. FIERY ARROWS launched against an unseen enemy.
E: CONT'D
C: WHOOSH!
D: With a HOWL, we see A MAN plucked off the ground, his body disappearing in the night. THE IMAGE DISSOLVES as -- the sky turns bright, the moon becoming a familiar ball of yellow gas.
C: HICKS
D: But man had the sun. THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find another GROUP OF MEN -- more sophisticated than the first. Makeshift weapons made of metal and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight. They stand before AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE, looks like a GIANT WASP NEST. Unsheathing their weapons, they step grimly inside. We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel.
E: CONT'D
C: HXCKS
D: And so it went like this over many years. As man and vampire both evolved -- the wars became bloodier. From afar, we see GIANT STACKS OF CORPSES as hydraulic machines stack the black bodies into pyres as big as buildings, smoke rising to the sky in twisting columns.
E: V.0. CONT'D
N: A LONE MAN Stands at the base of one of the mammoth pyres. Even from this angle we sens e his quiet dignity.
C: HICKS
D: Then came THE PRIESTS -- The Man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large CROSS TATTOO, cutting across his eyes and down the center.
E: V.0. CONT'D
C: HICKS
D: -- Specially trained warriors in the art of vampire combat. They single-handedly turned the tide for the humans. Quick glimpses of a GROUP OF PRIESTS battling a FURY OF VAMPIRES . Their technique is otherworldy -- combining the brutality of a Maori Warrior. with the grace of a Samurai. The--combat-is intense. Glorious. An explosion of blood and s b m i l
E: V.0. CONT'D we still do not get a good look at them
C: HICKS
D: Over time the vampire threat faded. The once fierce race now fatally diminished. A shadow of what they once. were. Through heavy smoke, we see a pile of VAMPIRE CORPSES, a ragged collection of fangs and claws.
E: V.0. CONT'D
C: HICKS
D: The remaining vampires were put Into camps and -- by decree of the High Clergy the Priests disbanded. The former warriors to be integrated as members of regular society. We see a WAX SEAL pressed onto an ancient parchment. The document carefully rolled and stored in an ORNATE CHAMBER.
E: V.0. CONT'D
C: HICKS
D: The human race thrived in relative quiet. The vampire menace quickly forgotten for other, more modern threats.
E: V.0. CONT'D
N: (BEAT) And the few surviving Priests faded Into quiet obscurity. The chamber is closed. We see an encrusted key turning in a heavy set lock and we --
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: .s. Our story begins with the rusty SCRAPE of a windmill...
T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. THE WASTELAND - DAY
N: Dust swirls in nasty tangles. A LONE MALE FIGURE moves across the plain, long and lean in overalls. AARON PACE. Shadows flicker across his sunburned face, the windmill looming above him. in his hands is an ELECTRONIC DEVICE, he plunges it into the earth. It makes a series of CLICKING SOUNDS, reading the soil. Aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a WOMAN standing in the doorway of his CABIN. He smiles, waving to her. His wife.
S: INT. OUTPOST 10 (NURSERY).- DUSK
N: A pioneer's wood cabin. Aaron sits surrounded, a lattice work of vines covering the walls and floors in beautiful patterns. Not a trace of soil anywhere in the room, everything hydroponically grown.
C: SHANNON
D: Supper's on! He smiles, studying a. stunning RUBY RED FLOWER, separate from the others. His crown jewel. He closes the door and enters --
E: O.S.
C: THE KITCHEN
D: SHANNON PACE carries a bowl filled with a steaming green broth, placing it on the dinner table, moving aside a tiny FIGURINE OF JESUS. The surrounding furniture cluttered with religious knickknacks.
C: SHANNON
D: You been spending an awful lot of time behind that door. Makes a woman suspicious.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: Special project. It's taking a little more time than I thought.
C: SHANNON
D: Nothing special about milkweed. Unless you like a thorn in the finger.
C: I AARON
D: It's not Milkweed. Not this year.
C: SHANNON
D: What is it?
C: AARON
D: You'll see. His eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss -- but he's
N: INTERRUPTED BY
C: LUCY
D: Yuck. Pershing-stew again. Their DAUGHTER . Already a heartbreaker. This girl is too young, too pretty to be out here in the badlands.
E: 0.S. 13
C: LUCY
D: I can't do it anymore. This outpost. Being all cooped up like this. I'm going
E: CONT'D
N: CRAZYL
C: AARON
D: Honey...we know this hasn't been easy for you -- In two years someone else'll study the soil and this'll be their outpost. But for right now -- this is my job.
C: LUCY
D: I don't know what it's like to have a best friend. To have any friends. I want to have a crush. I want secrets.
N: (SIMPLY) I want a life. Shannon looks at her husband. She knew this day would come.
C: SHANNON
D: Aaron. She's thirteen -- She should be with children her own age. Aaron lets out a breath.
C: AARON
D: Okay. Next year, we'll figure out a way to get you to a school close by. In town.
N: LUCY BUT
C: AARON
D: N year -- that's still plenty of time for you to have a "crush". Lucy deflates, knowing this is as good as it's going to get for awhile. Aaron takes her hand.
C: AARON
D: Tomorrow I'm heading in town to file. You come with, help your old man out, get a change of scenery. OK?
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Now c'mon, stew's getting cold. Bow your heads and say grace. The family clasps hands. Whatever their differences, there's a bond here.
C: LUCY
D: Dear Lord we thank you for what we are about to receive. Blessing us with your gifts... She.speaks with her eyes clenched shut, words spoken sincerely, nothing perfunctory about it. She's a believer.
C: LUCY
D: We thank you for the earth and the sky and for your bounty through Christ our Lord -- She.stops, opening her eyes -- staring at the plates and glasses on the table. They're RATTLING.
E: CONT'D
C: LU C Y
D: Daddy?
E: CONT'D
C: AA RON
D: Shh. He cocks his ear, heading a low rumble. Although he's never heard the sound before...he knows it can' only mean one thing. Trying to remain calm, Aaron goes to the window.
C: OUT THE WINDOW
D: Framed by a BLOOD MOON hanging over the horizon, a DOZEN BLACK MOTORCYCLES race across the plain, ENGINES thundering.
N: The Jesus figurine falls off the table, SHATTERING to the floor. Aaron looks at Shannon, an expression on his face she hasn't seen before -
C: AARON
D: Get the boards)
E: CONT'D
N: LUCY (ALARMED) What's going on? Aaron doesn't answer, Shannon helping him position pre-cut planks across every window and door. Each with an iron-cross strut for support
S: EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME
N: The CYCLES circle the house, kicking up dust in sheets.
S: INT.. OUTPOST 10 - SAME
N: The ROAR of the engines fills the house as Aaron pulls a POWERFUL LOOKING GUN from the drawer. He drops it, obviously not familiar with firearms.
C: AARON
D: Get by me. Shannon-and Lucy crouch at his feet.
S: EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME
N: The cycles cut their engines, headlights centered on the house. A blistering spotlight. It's quiet. The RIDERS step from their machines. We don't get a look at their faces as one by one they LEAP onto the house and windmill, SKITTERING across the walls and roof like spiders. The blades of the windmill slowly come to a stop. 11U. OUTPOST 10 r- SAME The power goes out, everything going black. LUCY (TERRIFIED) Daddy? We hear the Riders crawling over the outside of the house. Snarling, howling, making terrifying sounds. Then the worst sound of all. Wood being torn apart. BLAM! BLAN! Aaron SHOOTS like crazy, the white light MUZZLE FLASHES providing glimpses of SHAPES moving inside the house. BLACK BODIES blown back. Shrieking. Everything happening lightening fast. Finally, the gun clicks empty and we're plunged back into darkness. THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON Aaron is still standing, the house in shambles around him. He's alone. AARON
C: SHANNON!
D: From outside we hear the cycles revving. Aaron runs to the door. Rips off the board in time to see --
S: EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME
N: The motorcycles racing away, a cloud of dust in their wake. Aaron runs after but TRIPS on --
C: SHANNON
D: Her body lying in the dirt, head lurching at an obscene' angle. He brushes back her hair -- ere' g UNCT_URE MABKS in hem neck. Crying, he cradles his, wife. Feverishly looking around for
N: AARON
C: LUCY!
D: He keeps screaming but it's no use -- as the-motorcycles fade in the night he knows -- They've taken her. The CAMERA TILTS to the MOON hanging above the plain. it turns BLACK as we now find ourselves peering into --
S: EXT.. CITY FIVE/DISTRICT TWELVE - DUSK
N: The lip of an ENORMOUS SMOKESTACK. One of hundreds. A seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with soot and ash, while below, miles of FACTORIES stretch and stretch.
C: A STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS
D: Quitting time. Hundreds of WORKERS trail listlessly from a massive brick and stone COMPLEX. Grey faces betraying another day's toll.
C: A TATTOOED FIGURE
D: moves through the crowd, people stepping out of his way. They do this not out of respect. . .but fear. We don't get a good look at him. Just FLASHES -- Shaved head. Eyes like nail guns. Tendons clenching over muscle. As he walks,people whisper. He hears all of it. He heads into the streets. CITIZENS hurry by, some with. surgical masks over their mouths. There's a pale, sickliness to them. Malignant. The Figure suddenly stops. He cocks his bald head -- Something's caught his attention...
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: We move through trash and shadow finding -- A gang of FACTORY WORKERS, uniformed, surrounding a GIRL Their LEADER holds her close, BUTCHER KNIFE at her throat. Mouth at her ear.
C: LEADER
D: Go ahead ...scream.
N: (SMILES) Scream for daddy. He hears a noise, looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE standing at the head of the alley.
C: LEADER
D: Looks like daddy's already here. Well, then. Come on daddy...make it better. The Figure steps into a pool of white light, giving us our first good look at him -- A LAL RGE AK CROSS TATTOO shadows most of his-- a e. Across the eyes and down the center. The Mark Of The Priest.
E: CONT'D points the knife
N: LEADER (CONT'D) (LAUGHS) A Priest! Well, lookie here.. We got us a real life war-hero boysl Heard you guys were real baddasses. The Workers all pull out large knives.
C: LEADER
D: Guess we'll find out. They move in on Priest, chemicals burning in their blood, mouths leering. Priest folds his hands into the prayer position. The Workers look at each other. Laugh.
E: CONT'D
N: WORKER #1- What's he gonna do. . .BLESS us to death? VOOMI -- There's a whirling SNARL of sound -- the sonic equivalent of a back flip and -- Pries is holding their knives. Before they can react, he throws the knives into their feet. They HOWL, pinned to the concrete. Scared, the leader clutches the girl, pressing against the brick wall as Priest moves towards him.
C: LEADER
D: This ain't the war no more. You got no right meddlin'.
N: (BEAT) You don't belong here -- You ain't one of us. And with that he RAISES the blade to the girl's throat -- WHOOSHI A sudden RUSH OF AIR. The leader looks at the girl's neck, his blade's gone. So is his hand. Priest holds the severed limb, its fingers still clutching the blade. The Leader collapses, a Holy Shitl expression frozen on his face.
C: THE GIRL
D: Gawks at Priest, possibly more frightened of him than the workers. He turns to her, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how -- She flinches and runs away, disappearing into the street. A BEAT as Priest pries the butcher blade from the hand, wiping it off. Tucks it in his waistband. He moves on.
S: EXT. CHURCH (ESTABLISHING) - NIGHT
N: Gone to seed. The once proud house of God now a sad collection of moldering stone and cracked stained glass.
S: INT. CHURCH
N: PUSH past row after row of empty pews. We stop on the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH -- a foot sticking out from the door --
C: INSIDE THE BOOTH
D: FATHER KOEPPEN, body skinny and ravaged. The old man pours himself a drink and downs it. Coughing. The confessional door opens, someone steps inside the other booth. We can't see who it is.
C: FIGURE'
D: Bless me Father for I have sinned...again. The voice is like gravel from the bottom of a deep well. Quietly commanding. Koeppen knows it well.
C: KOEPPEN
D: I caught the ambulance picking up what was left of the factory boys...figured it was your handywork. The Shape leans forward, we see it is Priest.
C: PRIEST
D: This time there was a little girl.
C: KOEPPEN
D: if this keeps occurring it'll be .impossible to keep it from the Clergy. You'll get us both excommunicated. Priest gazes into the vestibule, his voice almost a whisper.
C: PRIEST
D: I want to see the other Priests.
C: KOEPPEN
D: You know you can't. The Clergy forbids it.
C: PRIEST
D: Why?
C: KOEPPEN
D: They have their reasons. Priest flicks his eyes over Koeppen as if he could see through the vestibule, but his expression doesn't change.
C: PRIEST
D: And their reasons for building more and more factories? The sky is turning black.
C: KOEPPEN
D: Since when is. industriousness a sin? Did Jesus not teach us to be productive?
N: (BEAT) As your appointed counselor take my advice, . .Relax -- Take up a hobby, pick a vice. Make friends.
C: PRIEST
D: You're my friend.
C: KOEPPEN
D: I'm a wicked old man who'd sell his parish for a pint of whiskey. Priest seems to deflate, his hard shell cracking.
C: PRIEST
D: I don't know what's happening to me. (7, Questions. Doubts. I'm not sure what it is. Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face.
C: KOEPPEN
D: The devil comes in many shapes. Do yourself a favor, keep your head down. Be smart. And most of all remember your oath... He hands Priest a set of ROSARY BEADS.
C: KOEPPEN
D: "To go against the Church is to go against God". This statement has always been the boilerplate of Priest's existence -- but tonight, it Just sounds like empty dogma. He squeezes his eyes shut, clutching the,rosary as we CUT TO:
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LOBBY OF TENAMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Garbage litters the floor. The sound of water dripping. Priest stands, waiting for the lift to arrive. A BOY AND HIS MOTHER wait too. The boy stares at Priest, fascinated, his mother doing her best to pretend not to notice him. The elevator arrives and they step inside.
S: INT. LIFT - MOMENTS LATER
N: As it rises, a single bulb flickers above. Buzzing. The boy continues to stare at Priest, bewitched by the tattoo. BOY (TO PRIEST) Did it hurt? The lift grinds to a stop. The mother quickly pulls her son out as the door rolls open, glaring at Priest, disappearing down a dark corridor. And only now does Priest answer. PRIEST (SOFTLY) Yes. The lift door clatters shut.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Sparse, containing only what's needed. Priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old battle scars -- Punctures. Scratches. Bite marks. His skin showing the early signs of aging. He goes to the lone decoration in his apartment -- A FADED PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY He takes the picture off the wall, studying it. The image bringing him peace. From the streets below, the sound of a GUNSHOT. He looks at the rosary beads, still in his hand. He turns out the light.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - 3 AM
N: Unable to sleep, Priest sits on the edge of his bed. Praying. There's a knock at the door.
C: PRIEST
D: Who is it?
N: MESSENGER (0. S.) Messenger. Priest opens the door. A MESSENGER holds up a PUNCH CARD. MESSENGER (CONY ' D) I gota Priority Punch. Originated in the wasteland. Priest takes the card, the man writing up a receipt.
S: INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Priest goes to a WOODEN BOX, feeding the punch card into it. A Rube Goldberg-like device of PULLEYS and WINCHES squeaks to- life, like a sail, a SCREEN rises and Aaron appears, his image a smudge. He looks awful. A man at the end of himself. AARON (FILTERED) L-Lucy's gone. They t-took her. I tried to stop 'em. I knowouu're..."retired". But can you find her? Find her before --. (SOBS) They killed Shannon. The screen goes blank. Priest shuts his eyes, making the sign of the cross. His hand curls into a fist.
S: EXT. CLERGY CITY (ESTABLISHING) - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Magnificent. At the Cities center, a municipal of baroque BASILICAS AND .CHURCHES -- all safely walled off from the rest of the metropolis.
S: INT. CLERGY CHAMBER - NIGHT
N: Giant shafts of moonlight hit a marbled floor. Priest and Father Koeppen are led by FOUR OFFICERS before A TRIBUNAL OF MONSIGNORS (all at least in their 70's). They sit behind a giant table cloaked in the florid robes of their religion. Men of scripture, creed and doctrine. Priest kneels, bowing his head.
C: PRIEST
D: Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Monsignors. Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader, ORELAS, leans forward, addressing him.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: Father Koeppen notified us of the situation. Our prayers are with your family.
C: PRIEST
D: I come before you because I would like my authority to be reinstated.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: On what grounds? Priest is taken aback.
C: PRIEST
D: She's my blood, Monsignor.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: The proper authorities are handling the situation. I'm sure they'll.do a fine job.
C: PRIEST
D: The proper authorities?
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: All occurrences of vampire. disobedience and felonies are strictly a Federal matter now.
N: (BEAT) You Priests did too good a job. The vampire population is classified as endangered. They're protected.
C: PRIEST
D: But Monsignor...they are the enemy.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: Were.the enemy. The war ended a long time ago.
C: PRIEST
D: Not so long that we should forget what they are capable of.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: You would do well to remember the words of our Savior: Turn the other cheek. Embrace your enemies.
N: (BEAT) It is not our place to interfere --- or yours. Priest looks up, obviously in great turmoil.
C: PRIEST-
D: I can be of.great service to the investigation. I -can
N: 0 The tribunal shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by Priest. Orelas stands.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: You forget yourself, Priest... It has been brought to our attention that you have engaged in a number of transgressions. Tell me...do you feel yourself to be above God?
C: PRIEST
D: No, Monsignor.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: Engaging in any kind of practice is sacrilege -- You bring shame upon our house. Priest turns the full force of his gaze on him.
C: PRIEST
D: "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven" --
N: MATTHEW 5:16
C: Â¢
D: The Monsignor POUNDS the table.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: You dare quote scripture to met Questioning the . authority. of the Clergy is forbidden1 If you engage in another transgression.you will be stripped from the Order and excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?
C: PRIEST
D: Yes, sir.'
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: I said do I make myself clear,. Father.
C: PRIEST
D: Yes, Monsignor.
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: You're a soldier. God's soldier-- Act like one.
N: (BEAT) Remember your vow: "To go against the Church is to go against God". The officers start to lead Priest and Koeppen out the chamber,
C: MONSIGNOR ORELAS
D: -- Eather..Kam, please stay behind for a moment, a .we have something we need to discuss. Off Koeppen's expression we CUT TO:
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. SOUP KITCHEN - ESTABLISHING
N: HOMELESS stand single file, wrapped around the corner, black flakes of ash drifting down as they await tonight's supper.
S: INT. SOUP KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Priest sits alone, rosary beads clutched in his hands. He looks up to find Koeppen, the old man staggering as he downs an EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, three sheets to the wind.
C: KOEPPEN
D: I knew I'd find you here. He sits, pouring himself another drink, toasting the poor souls at the surrounding tables.
C: KOEPPEN
D: How many nights in this very spot? You with your endless questions on the nature of suffering-Me with none of the answers. Priest doesn't even acknowledge him, lost in his thoughts.
E: CONT'D
C: KOEPPEN
D: Well, now I'm the one with a question. This one's a riddle.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) What is greater than God-but more evil than the Devil? The poor have it, the rich need it -- and if you eat it...you'll die. Priest looks, up, his eyes cold.
C: PRIEST
D: Why won't they listen to me? A beat. Koeppen takes another drink.
C: KOEPPEN
D: Okay. I'm going to.give you one more riddle and if you listen close - you might just hear an answer to your question.
E: clears his throat
N: (MORE)
C: KOEPPEN
D: How can a man who spent his whole life searching for devils miss the ones staring him in the face? From behind, a CLICKING sound. Priest turns to find an OFFICER standing, LASER-GUIDED SHOTGUN pointed at him. The soup kitchen suddenly deathly quiet.
E: CONT'D
C: KOEPPEN
D: The Church feels it's better to keep you under its care...at least until this trouble with your niece blows over..
E: CONT'D
C: PRIEST
D: You know I can't do that.
C: KOEPPEN
D: That's what I figured.
N: TEN TROOPERS IN FULL RIOT GEAR STORM IN Jackboots CLACKING, they form a circle around Priest and Koeppen. Guns SNAP into place, laser points dotting his body. Priest looks at Koeppen -- betrayed.
C: PRIEST
D: Why?
N: KOEPPEN (TOASTING RUEFULLY) "To go against the Church is to go against God'. Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle at the surrounding tables, terrified. There's only one thing left for him to do.
C: PRIEST
D: Then ...I go against God. In an eyeblink -- Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer, CRACKING it against the trooper's head, his attack graceful and precise -- a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES. When it's over, eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing. Everything goes quiet.
N: ANGLE ON: A LITTLE BOY He breaks, from his father.'' knee, slowly moving towards the window, drawn by a FLICKERING SHADOW. His mouth drops open as -- WHAM! -- TWENTY MORE TROOPERS PUNCH through the windows in unison, showering everybody with glass! BULLETS whistle through the air, everyone SCREAMING as they scramble for cover. The father diving for his son.
C: PRIEST
D: Folds his hands into the prayer position. VOONI There's a POP OF AIR and ---
C: SILENCE
D: The: troopers look around confused -- their guns have disappeared.
N: A...,
C: ON A NEARBY TABLE
D: A neat pile of shotguns sit, every FIRED BULLET collected harmlessly in a clean circle around them ...as if picked out of thin air.
C: THE LITTLE BOY
D: is somehow back with his father, the two safely holding hands, staring stupidly at each other. Priest is gone.
C: KOEPPE4
D: Looks at his fancy whiskey bottle, inside now floats Priest's ROSARY BEADS. He fishes them from the bottle, hand shaking.
C: KOEPPEN
D: Heaven help us. He takes a swig.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
N: The STRIKE of a match -- a prayer candle is lit, glowing in the darkness.
C: AT THE ALTAR
D: Priest kneels, eyes clenched shut in prayer. A large figurine of Jesus on the cross looms over him. The Christ is expressive -- He suffers.
C: PRIEST
D: oh my God...I am sorry for. having offended you. it was never my intention to do so... His words continue OVER
S: EXT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT
N: Priest standing in front of a STEEL DOOR. Hasn't been opened for some time.

C: PRIEST W.S. CONT'D)
D: But I can't.
S: EXT. STORAGE UNIT NIGHT
N: An ENGINE ROARS, RUMBLES, idling... a throaty GURGLE... Priest pulls out on a
C: BLACK MOTORCYCLE
D: if this thing were a horse it'd be the ultimate stallion-- Pulse engine. Nitrous. The works. A panel of black titanium solar cells covers the bike like armor. He races onto the street.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Sheets of rain fall like lead. Pooling in the gutters.
C: PRIEST
D: All I can do is ask for forgiveness for what is yet to come...
E: O.S.
N: The cycle knifes through the city. Expertly working his way through congested streets. Moving past tent cities, stockyards and rusty industrial machinery.
S: EXT. CITY LIMIT - NIGHT
N: We see a MASSIVE WALL -- A hundred feet high, surrounding the city. Priest pulls up to a CHECKPOINT TOWER. A PHALANX OF GUARDS with big shotguns at the ready, snapping into place. Mugs like anvils.
C: PRIEST
D: I now know the devil lives within me. The sins coming all too easy... Still on his bike, Priest's foot touches the ground, blocking our view as we CUT TO:
E: O.S.
S: EXT. CITY LIMIT - MOMENTS LATER
N: THE MASSIVE DOOR/WALL sliding open with a KLANG1 revealing the wasteland. PRIEST (0.3.) And all too frequently. Priest REVS his bike, gunning out the doors. UNCONSCIOUS BODIES left in his wake.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
N: Blazing sun. An endless plain of cracked earth. Nothing around anywhere...
C: VROOMI
D: Priest's cycle streaks across the salt flats. It's glorious.
S: EXT. WASTELAND - LATER
N: Priest rides past a line of ANCIENT STATUES dominating the landscape, each representing one of the seven deadly sins, sentinels marking the boundary into the deep wasteland. He FLOORS it, the bike PUNCHING for the horizon, a thick plume of dust funneling behind it...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OUTPOST 10 - NIGHT
N: It's quiet, Just the sound of the rusty windmill. The only light provided by the moon reflecting off Priest's cycle, he's just arrived. He crouches, examining,a fresh TIRE TREAD. He stares, taking in the landscap e, feeling it. Then he steps inside the cabin --
S: INT. OUTPOST 10
N: It looks like a war zone. Splintered furniture everywhere, sprays of dried, black blood over the floorboards. He brushes away rubble and finds a DRESS, Shannon's. Putting his face to it, he inhales, his expression softening.
C: BEHIND HIM
D: Quietly, A COWBOY HAT and a SHOTGUN BARREL emerge from a hole in the floor.
C: COWBOY HAT
D: Alright, now -- Not another step. Climbing out from the hole, both barrels pointed, is SHERIFF HICKS . You could say the name fits. But you'd only be half right.
E: 22
C: HICKS
D: Thought you'd come back for a souvenir, hub? You gotta be the dumbest bloodsucker I ever come across. Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face.
C: PRIEST
D: If I was a vampire you'd be dead already. The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing his hat back on his forehead.
C: HICKS
D: I'll be dammed. He casually spits some ATOMIC CHAW, hitting the floorboards with a SIZZLE.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HALBRIDGE - NIGHT
N: Hicks and Priest ride in tandem across the plain. Hicks' bike a standard police vehicle, nothing fancy but reliable. They head towards town, passing aWOODEN SIGN`-- HALBRIDGE
S: EXT. HALERIDGE (MAIN STREET) - NIGHT
N: At a glance this seems like one of those frontier towns from an old western. TOWNSPEOPLE gather around a SNAKE-OIL SALESMAN, the man pitching his wares before a painted van reading DR. TOMLIN'S MEDICINE SHOW. TRANCE MUSIC wafts from the nearby saloon.
C: SNAKE OIL SALESMAN

C: HICKS
D: That's one. KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb.
C: HICKS
D: Two. Immediately, the salesman quickly packs up his wares, scrambling for the van door. As he gets in, he catches a look at Priest, pauses a moment, then starts up the vehicle and quickly PEELS away. Hicks pulls the knife from the wall, holds the bag up to the crowd.
E: CONT'D
C: HICKS
D: Now you all listen up. This bag ain't good fornothin' but linin' that man's pockets with your hard earned money. Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their sheriff but they're frightened. An older man named, CROCKER, steps up.

C: WOMAN
D: And what about the girl? Hicks pauses. This is not easily said.
C: HICKS
D: I filed a report with the Cities last night. I'm sure they're Join' all they can. The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over to Priest, a GROUP OF CHILDREN have already gathered,. pointing and whispering at him.
S: INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: A hole in the wall. A few wanted posters and postal warrants tacked up on a board beside asingle jail cell. Hicks leads Priest inside.
C: HICKS
D: I've already had one of the boys send for your brother. We got him put up at Paddy's place. Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are milling out front, staring at him.. He pulls down the shade.
C: HICKS
D: You're gonna have to excuse the attention.. We don't get strangers `round here too much -- "Specially no Priest. 'Course we ain't never had no vampire attack in.these parts before. But then you're just here to perform the service, right? Priest doesn't reply, staring at a yellowed wanted poster.
E: CONT' D eyeing Priest.

S: EXT. CEMETARY ' - DAY

C: SHANNON'S COFFIN
D: Lies in a freshly dug hole. Priest sprinkles dirt across.the casket, offering prayers. Aaron watches,. silently. A GROUP OF TOWNSPEOPLE encircle the grave. Everyone wearing black goggles for protection from the swirling dust.
C: HICKS
D: Stands apart from the others, hat in his hands. His eyes focused on Priest. Not even watching as -- Aaron plants the RUBY RED FLOWER at the head of the grave. Its glorious color almost obscene in this barren wasteland.

S: INT. PADDY'S PLACE - DAY
N: A DOG rests lazily in front of a rotating fan. PADDY'S a bear of a man, the town bachelor. He plops down two bowls of brown stew before a waiting and hungry Aaron and Priest, The gruel smells foul, tastes fouler.
C: PADDY
D: Jackrabbit Stew. Never served no man of the cloth before. Hope you like it spicy, Father! He stands over both of them, eager for a response. Priest takes a sip, grimaces, tries his best to smile but fails hideously.
C: PRIEST
D: .Delicious
C: PADDY
D: `Course it isl it was me Ma's recipe. As Paddy jubilantly walks away, Priest puts the bowl on the floor and the dog pads over, eagerly lapping it up. Aaron smiles.

C: AARON
D: How come you never came round more? You know you were always welcome.
C: PRIEST
D: I know.
C: AARON
D: After the war was over we figured you'd stay with us. Shannon was real fond of you. Lucy too. She was always asking about you. Uncomfortable with the conversation, Priest pulls out a map, unrolling it onto the wooden table. He moves his finger across the paper.
C: PRIEST
D: The pack headed in this direction. There's a reservation up that way so that's where I'll start.

N: A SHOPCLERK mops the floor, guns of all types lining his walls. Everything from old Smith and Wesson's to the latest and most powerful hand cannons. With a jingle, the door opens revealing Priest. The clerk smiles. All he needs is one look and he knows -- This guy's good for business.
C: CLERK
D: Good afternoon, sir! How may I be of service?
C: PRIEST
D: I need bullets.
C: CLERK
D: How many?

C: AARON
D: Maybe if I knew how to use these she'd still be alive.
C: PRIEST
D: Sometimes things just happen. Fault's got nothing to do with it.
C: AARON
D: Funny. I'm the one who used to say that. You were the one who always said everything was God's will. Priest takes the bullet from him.
C: PRIEST
D: I'm not so sure anymore. There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's Sheriff Hicks.
C: HICKS
D: Aaron.
C: AARON
D: Sheriff.
C: HICKS
D: You mind if I have a word-with your brother? An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing what the other's thinking.
C: PRIEST (0.S.
D: It's alright. Let him in. Eyeing Priest, Aaron lets the Sheriff in, shutting the door behind him as he leaves. The vibe in the room is uncomfortable -- Priest not even acknowledging Hicks.

N: (MORE)
C: HICKS
D: it strictly states it is forbidden for anyone to hunt vampires anymore.
E: CONT'D

C: HICKS
D: On the other hand -- if I go after Lucy there'll be a warrant on mybead too...and that'll put us in the same briar patch.
E: CONT'D
N: Priest looks at the object -- It's Hicks' sheriff's badae. Five points glowing brightly in the candlelight.

D: We leave at sun up. Priest turns. A moment as each man studies the other.
E: CONT'D
C: PRIEST
D: Why?
C: HICKS
D: We're the only chance she's got. Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched CROSS now in its tip . He SNAPS it in the air.
E: this is what he's been doing
C: PHHHHTTI
D: Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the wall. A thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing, spilling to the floor. The kid's fast.
C: PRIEST
D: How you with a gun?
C: HICKS
D: Better than I am with a knife. Priest considers this.
C: PRIEST
D: I'll be there. Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out, stops at the door.
C: HICKS
D: What's with all the bullets anyway? I thought Priests don't use firearms.
C: PRIEST
D: We don't.
N: (BEAT) They're for you. Hicks nods, realizing Priest was ahead of him the whole time.
S: INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
N: Moonlight streams through an open window. Priest places his bible on the nightstand and crouches beside the:.bed, closing his eyes. Hands clasped.
C: PRIEST
D: Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven... As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and into the night, moving across HALBRIDGE.
C: PRIEST
D: Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. We see the TOWNSPEOPLE: lock their doors, bolting the shutters, tucking their children in safely for the night.
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: PRIEST
D: For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. And now the camera stops on a LARGE SHADOWY FIGURE perched on a nearby roofline.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: The only thing we can see of it is a DUSTER illuminated by the SOFT GLOW OF A LIT CHEROOT...the Figure watches Priest as he finishes his prayer and blows out a candle. Silently, the Figure takes off. Flying into the night.

N: The sky is brightening, the edge of the world turning white.
S: EXT. CENETARY - SAME
N: Sunlight hits Shannon's grave, the CROSS MARKER casting a shadow, the once glorious red flower already withered. Aaron watches the sunrise, some other time he would've been moved by the sight, maybe even cried. This morning... nothing. Priest is beside him.
C: AARON
D: You never talked much about the war but I know you saw things. Bad things.
C: PRIEST
D: Yes.
C: AARON
D: What'd you do...to make yourself unsee `em? To make it stop playing in your head?
C: PRIEST

N: KNOW THAT (THINKS) But then Lucy was born. .and as soon as I saw her I knew. I Just knew -ï¿½- There's no way something so perfect came from me. She was a gift. From God. (looks at Priest) You find her. Whatever it takes. Find Lucy. Priest nods, his brother's eyes burning into him. Hearing the sound of an engine, both men turn to find Hicks pulling up.
C: HICKS
D: Didn't mean to be late -- My deputies are a little green about keepin' the peace all by their lonesome. Needed a pep talk.
N: (TO PRIEST) Figure I'll ride point. I know my way `round the Wasteland better than just `bout anyone. ' Without so much as a word, Priest climbs on his cycle and kick starts it, the engine REVVING to life. VROOMI off he goes. Hicks can't help but laugh. HICKS (CONT'D) (TO AARON) Real charmer, your brother.
C: AARON
D: That's just his way. Don't pay it no mind.

C: PRIEST
D: Familiars are illegal.
C: HICKS
D: Nobody really enforces it. most come from the fringes. Drifters. They're creepy as all hell -- but harmless. They turn off their bikes and dismout. Hicks stepping awkwardly between the chickens. A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin. His gaze is slack -- More dead than alive. He picks up a chicken and CHOP1 off goes its head, blood draining into the container. His voice a hissing rasp.
C: FAMILIAR
D: Good afternoon, Sheriff... Father. What brings you to Nightshade?
C: HICKS
D: We're looking for a Vamp Pack. They woulda' came through here a couple nights ago.
C: FAMILIAR

S: INT. CRYPT - CONTINUOUS
N: The light of the sun's never been in here. Probably should have stayed this way. Tiny bones-cover the entire floor., excrement smearing the walls. The Crypt Familiar cowers-in the corner, shielding his eyes from-the light. His body'fishbelly white and sickly.

N: CRYPT FAMILIAR (SOBBING) Please. Please don't hurtmy Master.
C: PRIEST
D: Your.Master'll be dead. He shoves the slab more, the light rays hanging just outside the edge. And now The Familiar begins to laugh, a horrible rattling sound. Something in his mood has shifted.

C: HICKS
D: Pulls off his COWBOY HAT. Activating a release. With a CLICK! thousands- of needle--like teat ext e d fro the brim. With deadly accuracy, he flings the hat: It FLASHES through the air, DAIS'iWHEELING around a Familiar's neck, pinpricking his skin and finally whirling back to Hicks' band likean obedient pup. A BEAT as the Familiar stands, mouth agape. Then with a wet SNAP his head rolls off his shoulders, THUDDING in the dirt. Hicks falls to the ground, his wound starting to get the best of him. He musters up his strength for another hat attack but before he can --

D: Leaps in front. Blocking his way.
C: PRIEST
D: Not yet. With a HORRIBLE SCREECH the Familiars attack, LAUNCHING at Priest and Hicks. Blades in the air.

Look at this -- He goes to a shelf, it's been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE -- rw=ging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes, yellowed photographs, collected junk.

Whatever it is, it's fast. Quickly countering for every move he gives, neither able to get the upper hand. Too dark to make out what it is. Priest locks his arms around the shape's arms, SLAb24=G it against the wall, illuminating it under the torch light.

C: PRIESTESS
D: Should we lead it into open air? More room to. maneuver.

N: THE SERVANT FAMILIAR slides the door open, carrying food for Lucy, no tray this time. But she's not there. He SCREECHES, dropping the-food as he runs to a HOLE ripped in the wood floor, smatterings of blood around the edges. It's not very big, just enough for a small body to fit through. The Familiar sticks his head through the opening and -,-

D: CLACK past at a furious speed, inches from his head! The noise is deafening..
C: LUCY
D: Hey... The Familiar turns -- Lucy's perched inside one of the JOISTS lining the underside of the train. KRACKI- She lets loose with a well-placed KICK, snapping his head back so he catches on the track. With ascream, he's quickly SUCKED out the train, pulverized on the track. Lucy's covers her mouth, her nails an ugly bloody mass. She's come this far, time to go the rest. She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving along the underside of the train, her body just centimeters from the passing track.
E: 0.S.
C: OHB SLIPS
D: Catching herself just in time. Her eyelids practically brushing the wood. Taking a deep breath, she manages to hoist herself through the rest of the way finally making it to the CABOOSE. She pulls herself up onto the back of the car. Now what? The train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed. Only one thing to do. She makes the sign of the cross, closes her eyes and JUMPS
S: EXT WASTELAND (EDGE OF THE PLAINS) - DAY
N: A dustorm. The plain's a shifting veil of sand, parting to reveal a vista of dunes, wind shipping across them. As quickly as it opened the veil closes again, shifting to reveal OUR TRIO plowing through, blast goggles and respirators covering their faces. The Priestess riding a cycle identical to Priest's. In the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as they arrive at Jericho.
S: EXT. JERICHO - DAY
N: Riding into town. The storm making it difficult to see anything as they idle onto main street. It's deserted -- The only sound a saloon door creaking noisily in the wind. Ominous signs left in the vampires' wake are everywhere -- BROKEN DOORS, SHATTERED WINDOWS, OVERTURNED VEHICLES.
C: PRIEST
D: We separate. Go through each building, see what we find.
C: HICKS
D: I'll start with the sheriff.
C: PRIESTESS
D: Be careful. Just because it's daylight doesn't mean it's safe. Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest.
S: EXT. JAIL DAY
N: Everything is eerily quiet, just the sound of the wind. Hicks crouches just outside the door, examining SPENT SHELL CASINGS littering the walkway. He pulls out his six-shooter, pushing the door open with his gun, stepping inside --
S: INT. JAIL CONTINUOUS
N: The place is a mess. DUST BLOWN IN FROM THE STORM COVERS EVERYTHING, broken furniture scattered everywhere, glass littering the floor. Whatever went down here -- someone put up a hell of a fight.

S: INT. BROTHEL - SAME TIME
N: The Priestess walks in, flurries of yellow dust swirling in her wake, filling the room. if the jail was a disaster zone, this place is just plain creepy. Red sofas, red curtains, hell, even red wine. Everything set up for a great time...just no people. A PIANO sits nestled in the corner, she walks to it and runs her finger across the dust covered keys. It comes up wet and red. Blood. MUSIC SUDDENLY BURSTS FROM THE PIANO The plinking keys playing by themselves, activated by pneumatic pegs on a rotating paper roll, filling the lonely room with tin-pan music.
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: The sound of a record skipping. Priest steps through a doorway, the door already ripped off its hinges. Broken furniture and glass. It's obvious a FAMILY lived here, children's clothes and wooden toys messily strewn across the floor. He walks to an OLD PHONOGRAPH sitting on the windowsill, still playing, placing the needle back in its cradle. That's when so=thing out the window ratchgo hiseve...
S: EXT. JERICHO/MAIN STREET DAY
N: Hicks, done searching, meets up with the Priestess in the middle of the street, he's pretty disturbed. Wind howling around him.
C: HICKS
D: There ain't nobody left. Nobody.
N: PRIESTESS (OMINOUS) Too many mouths to feed.
C: HICKS
D: Where's Priest?
N: But the Priestess's already focused on something else, gazing at something behind the general store. He turns to see what it is.
C: PRIEST
D: On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of prayer. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the full
C: PICTURE:
D: Before Priest are THREE LARGE WOODEN CROSSES, A NAKED BODY ON EACH, crucified. Because of the swirling sand it's hard to make out their faces but it's obvious the poor souls are already dead. Immediately the Priestess drops beside Priest, joining him -- And it is only now that we get a good look at the crucifieds'

N: Bare feet running on the salt-flats. It's Lucy. Covered in dirt, battered and bruised but chugging along. There is absolutely NOTHING out here, only LUCY AND A BLACK FIGURE DROPS SILENTLY FROM THE SKY BEHIND HER it wears a BLACK COAT, fluttering in the wind as it touches down, the fabric cascading across the earth in long dark folds. The Figure's face is completely covered by a BLACK COWBOY HAT. The only thing we can see is a CHEROOT Sticking out from where the mouth would be. A brief moment as the tip of the cigar glows, a puff of smoke exhaled. It drops to the ground, silver spurs making a slight CHING sound as a BLACK BOOT stamps it out. Lucy hears the sound and turns just in time to see - y I ATHICK CHAIN __SHOOTING OUT from within the Fiaure', coat. a HUGE METAL_ FINGERED CLAW at use ! The claw SLAMS into Lucy, thick fingers CLAMPING around her, knocking her to THE GROUND She digs her nails into the earth but it's no use as the chain DRAGS her backwards and she quickly-disappears INTO the coat with a SCREAM. The folds enveloping her in a dark embrace. In one graceful sweep, the Black Figure leaps to the sky. Quickly disappearing. We see the cheroot on the ground. Spent. The only evidence that anyone or anything was ever out here at all.

N: Caught between sheets of swirling dust and.sand, the images like hallucinations, moments of ritual and grief -- A. The crucified Priests taken down from their crosses, their naked bodies like ragdolls. B. The corpses now wrapped in white cloth, carefully placed amongst the makeshift pyre. C. Flames engulfing the bodies, a twisty column of smoke rising, the sun and clouds painting the sky pink and gold. OUR TRIO stands before the pyre gazing into the fire, it Pops consuming more of the bodies, if the Priests listen close enough they can hear the end of an era.
C: HICKS
D: Don't make no sense. What were they doin' out here?
C: PRIESTESS
D: The same thing as us.
N: (BEAT) Someone's drawing us out.
C: HICKS
D: Who? The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea.
C: HICKS
D: I imagine you'll have to go back to the Cities, inform the Clergy. A sudden silence.
E: CONT'D
C: PRIEST
D: We're not going back.
N: The Priestess looks at him, he speaks for her as well but she's still shocked to hear the words out loud. A lifetime of conditioning..
C: PRIESTESS
D: We'll burn for this.
C: PRIEST
D: We already are. Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING. She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones, pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools. Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a

T: CUT TO.
S: INT. JAIL DAY
N: Hicks pulls a LARGE MAP off the wall, blowing off a layer of dust, drawing a line across the paper with his finger.
C: HICKS
D: The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way in the backcountry, bought the ore from the deep mines. There were about five stops along the route. I think. He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS.
C: HICKS
D: Looks like Jericho was, the last town it glances before'. heading around the Linwood Mountains...Then it goes to the last stop.
E: CONT'D
C: PRIEST
D: Where? He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.
C: HICKS
D: The Cities. So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.
C: PRIESTESS
D: They must have been picking up different factions along the way. Moving during the day, feeding at night.
C: HICKS
D: But headin' to the Cities is suicide. The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere to hide. Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled.
C: PRIEST
D: They won't have to. And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO:

N: The Night Train barreling down the track, blasting along on its grim trajectory. Suddenly --

C: WHISPER)
D: She'd be dead if not for me...swallowed by the wasteland. We see Lucy on the floor at the Figure's feet, his pale hand runs calmly through her hair. From the shadows, Black Hat steps forward, looking down at Lucy. She struggles but the hand tightens its grip.
C: BLACK HAT
D: What do you want for her? And now her captor lifts his hat -- revealing paper-thin skin, eyes like black coal. This is RUNE, a bounty hunter.
C: RUNE
D: You know what r want. Black Hat's eyes flick upwards, glinting in the. candlelight.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Don't. go too far, Rune.
C: RUNE

N: Black Hat eyes him.

C: RUNE
D: I was involved long before you showed up.
N: (SEETHING) I've been waiting years for a chance at him...and now that he's here I find x have to ask a Prime permission... Like a snake, a finger of the claw emerges from the folds of his jacket, wrapping itself around Lucy's neck.
C: RUNE
D: My how things have changed. Ever so slightly, the metal finger SQUEEZES Lucy's throat, choking her.
E: CONT'D
C: RUNE
D: I never cared about your war. Never got Involved. Us halfbreeds. We were exiles -- rejected by both humans and vampires. All we wanted was a quiet place. But he wiped out my whole tribe.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Maybe it's time to return the favor. The metal finger wraps TIGHTEtR, Lucy gasps, the "tension becoming unbearable until finally
C: BLACK HAT
D: Fine. He's Yours. As if on command, the finger retreats back into the jacket, Lucy COLLAPSING to the floor coughing and choking.
C: RUNE
D: And -- she's yours. He laughs, sounds like a death rattle, dropping the cigar to the floor, spurs chiming as he walks out the car door, long dark coat fluttering behind him, disappearing into the night.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Annoyed, picks up the still burning cigar, squeezing it in his hand. He turns to Lucy.
C: BLACK HAT
D: And as for you uy dear...You're more trouble than I anticipated. Must be your uncle's blood in you.

S: EXT. WASTELAND - DUSK
N: Twilight. Hicks and the two Priests ride past tumbleweed drifts, the surrounding desertscape golden in the fading light. Ahead a forboding series of CRAGGY MOUNTAINS, awaits, a WINDING TRAIL criss-crossing through the peaks. They stop, their machines idling next to each other, taking stock of the huge task _beâ¬ore' them.
C: HICKS

S: EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS NIGHT

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - LATE NIGHT
N: They've set up camp for the night on the lip of a ridge. Hicks and the Priestess sit by a fire dunking their feet in a nearby stream, the wear and tear of their journey evident on the sheriff's face. Priest lies close by, asleep.
C: HICKS
D: If we push it hard we'll gain two days on 'em. Should be enough to get us a jump.
C: PRIESTESS
D: We'need more than a jump. We need a miracle.
C: HICKS
D: That's the funny thing about time -- He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the liquid leak from between his fingers.
C: HICKS
D: It's always runin' right through my fingers.
E: CONT'D
C: PRIESTESS
D: You should try harder, sheriff. She cups her hand in the water, bringing it to her lips for a drink. Hicks smiles, leaning forward, something on his mind.
C: HICKS
D: You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest?
C: PRIESTESS
D: No.
C: HICKS
D: What about a husband, children...A family?
C: PRIESTESS
D: I've had a family -- just not the kind you're familiar with.
N: Hicks glances at Priest.
C: HICKS
D: What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there?
C: PRIESTESS
D: He's not so bad once you get to know him. A beat, Hick's expression becoming serious.
C: HICKS
D: He's going to kill her, isn't he? If. she's turned.
C: PRIESTESS
D: Yes.
C: HICKS
D: There's things that can be done. She doesn't have to die.
C: PRIESTESS
D: She's his bloodline... and he's a Priest. It's the only way. Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire, troubled, but he knows there's no point in discussing it any further... for now.
C: HICKS
D: And how many of you Priests are left now? A long moment before she speaks.
C: PRIESTESS
D: Two. Hicks doesn't know what to Say-,,

S: INT. VAMPIRE HIVE - DREAM SEQUENCE/FLASHEIACK
N: It's dark. A GROUP OF PRIESTS (OUR TWO amongst them) move silently through a DEEP TRENCH, moist earthen walls rising around them, the air putrid with stink, mud clinging to their feet. Last: in the line, is a particularly FEARSOME PRIEST ...unlike the others, he's smiling, enjoying the action. As a cohesive unit, the Priests, climb up from the trench, scaling through the muck. They find themselves at the base of the hive, looking around at a chilling sight --
C: THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS
D: stretching endlessly, rising high above in a cone. THOUSANDS
C: OF SLEEPING VAMPIRES.
D: OUR PRIEST, motions with his hand to the others, giving precise instructions, their movements well coordinated. He stops. Hearing a sound...a faint but incr. A BEAT as the Priestess looks at the others.
C: PRIESTESS
D: They know we're here. From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP, grabbing onto a Priest's leg, pulling him down. Suddenly DOZENS OF VAMPIRES emerge, seemingly birthed from the soil. The warriors fight valiantly. Fiercely. But it's too much. Most are quickly cut down.
C: PRIEST
D: Retreat!
C: FEARSOME PRIEST
D: Battles like a tiger, grappling with TWo VAMPIRES, their claws at his throat, fangs inches from his face. A couple of quick moves and - before you realize how - the vanires lay dead. He quickly joins the surviving Priests as they run through the hive, a dizzying maze of MUDDY TUNNELS AND TRENCHES.
C: FEARSOME SUDDENLY STOPS
D: A BLACK TOP HAT lying on the ground catching his eye, must be the last remanent of a dandy gentleman. He picks it up, admiring the souvenir. Puts it on his head. The Priestess races by, shooting him a we don't have time for this' look. He STOPS her, grabbing her shoulder
N: FEARSOME PRIEST (WINKS) What do you think -- Am I a "Dapper Dan"? She glares, running ahead to join the group. Fearsome just smiles, taking off the hat.
C: FEARSOME PRIEST
D: Guess not. From within the hive comes a MIGHTY SHRIEK -- and now Fearsome starts to run, trying to catch the others as they scramble for daylight. The exit just in sight. At the last second -- He's pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS. The hat still gripped tightly in his hand as he's dragged away. our two Priests reach for him but it's too late ...He disappears into the darkness as we CUT BACK TO:
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - NIGHT
N: Priest WAKING UP, breath catching in his throat. He looks over to find the Priestess working on her cycle, unable to sleep. There's a tension in the air, the sense of something about to break as he joins her.
C: PRIESTESS
D: Why would the Clergy forbid us from seeing each other?
C: PRIEST
D: Maybe they were scared of what we could do.
C: PRIESTESS
D: Or what we would do.
N: (PAUSE) We both know there's something inside the Order that's off. Even if we don't know what it is.
C: PRIEST
D: With or without the Clergy...we're still Priests. And we're the only ones who can stop that train.
C: PRIESTESS
D: If we survive this we need to expose them for what they are.
N: PRIEST (PAUSE) We won' t survive this. She puts down her tools, staring fixedly at him.
C: PRIESTESS
D: You scared to die?_
C: PRIEST
D: No.
C: PRIESTESS
D: I believed in Heaven my whole life. Believed everything we were taught -- And now...when it's finally my time...no more faith. They took it away from me. Priest gazes at her, trying his best to be comforting.
C: PRIEST
D: Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go. We'll go together. At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a little bit, a door opens -- never to be shut again.
C: PRIEST
D: What in greater than God but more evil than the Devil? The poor have it, the rich need it -- and if you eat it...you'lldie.
E: CONT'D
C: PRIESTESS
D: What?
C: PRIEST
D: It's a riddle. The Priestess thinks about it.
C: PRIESTESS.
D: Nothing. That's the answer.
N: (BEAT) Nothing is greater than God. Nothing is more evil than the devil. The poor have nothing, the rich need nothing. And if you eat nothing... you'll die. It's said that warriors can become close friends only when they see each other's hearts -- Priest now knows this to be true.
C: -PRIEST
D: What you said before...about those nights when you were dreaming of me --
C: PRIESTESS
D: The good nights.
C: PRIEST
D: Yes. The good nights. Do you think maybe tonight...
C: PRIESTESS
D: Could be one of those nights? She smiles. And then Priest does the most amazing thing. . .he smiles back. Things happen fast -- He finds himself planting his mouth on hers... the years of conditioning, all the ritual and tradition falling away in a flash. And it is here, together in this place, where they feel like they finally truly belong. The last two.

N: A blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze. Morning has come. A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS As our trio forges onward and upward, the trail more treacherous with every twisty ridge, the overhangs looming ominously as they head deeper into the mountain.
S: EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS - LATER
N: The final climb. Yawning crevices, the wind moaning as it whistles between the canyon walls. Carefully they ride across DEVIL'S BRIDGE, a finger of stone, just wide enough for the cycles, on either side a straight drop to, oblivion. The peak of the mountain Just ahead. The Priestess is in front leading the charge, closely followed by Hicks. Priest brings up the rear, he stops just past the bridge, looks around. Something's wrong.
C: HICKS
D: I- ee itl Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain.
C: IN THE DISTANCE
D: A long black line snakes along the rail, puffs of heavy smoke lining its path; The Night Train. They're ahead of it. Barely. In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to Priest. But he's gone. Off her reaction we CUT TO:
S: EXT. CREVASSE - DAY
N: Tall rock walls flank Priest on. either side, the surrounding mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps. Slowly he walks through the canyon, senses fully attuned. It's quiet.

C: PRIEST
D: This isn't the time to settle old scores, Rune.
N: RUNE (0. S. ) I disagree... This is the perfer, time. WOOSH! Like lightning, the claw LASHES out, appearing from. nowhere. Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he was standing. He lands on top of the chain, backflipping as it retracts back. Gearing up for another attack. RUNE (0.s.) (CONT'D) You've lost a step Priest...I never came this close before.
C: PRIEST
D: I'm older now. We can almost bear Rune smile.
N: RUNE (0.8.) Not me. And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction, WRAPPING around Priest like a snake, the metal cutting into his body, snapping a ribt Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's got. Rune flies from the mist, dragged by Priest, crashing at his feet. The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the coils, grabbing Rune by the jacket, picking him up. Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priest's stomach, the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh, tearing the muscle, Priest SCREAMS, a hot rush of, blood staining the desert floor. Rune leaps away, landing ontop a boulder.

It's a savage battle, Priest's muscles and laser-like focus the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider. Hunched, ready to strike BUT --
C: THE PRIESTESS
D: Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands beside Priest. The two together, a formidable presence. But Rune's a tough customer, he readies himself for another attack. ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound. Rune looks over, sees --
C: HICKS
D: Six-shooter pointed right at him.
N: A beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff. The air between them vibrating with energy. Crackling. Rune considering his options. RUNE (CONP' D) (HISSING) Another time, Priest. He skitters up the rock face, disappearing into the mist.
C: HAM!
D: Hicks fires a single shot, the echo ringing through the canyon.
C: RUNE'S BODY
D: Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead. And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest. Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise.

C: PRIEST
D: It's our way.
C: HICKS
D: And what is that? Some special Priest code of honor? You don't get it. Your "way' -- It's over!
C: PRIEST
D: Shoot me and it won't matter if you find Lucy. You won't stop that train -- and you won't save her. The Priestess steps between them, looks at Hicks.
C: PRIESTESS
D: He's right. We need to be together on this... it's the only shot we have. Hicks thinks about it, knows she's right. A tense beat then
C: HICKS
D: This ain't done. He lowers his gun and walks away. The two warriors stand together, the Priestess gazing at Priest...hedoesn't return it. Without a word, he heads back to his cycle. She doesn't see as his hand touches his stomach. It comes up red.

N: PRIEST At the last second, DUCKS, grabbing onto. the chain, swinging himself around in a graceful arc and KICKING his legs into a split. WHAM! his feet SLAM the two cyclists off their bikes and into the dirt. He lands back on the ground in a crouch, the steel chain tight in his grip -- Ready for battle. And he gets it.
C: THE OTHER FOUR RIDERS
D: Circle Priest, surrounding him, the ROAR of their engines like massive power drills.
C: PRIEST
D: Snaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out. The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a tangled mess. With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger, quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs.
C: A BRUTAL FIGHT
D: Spinning, twisting, kicking, gnashing. Bodies locked in deep combat as Priest fends off the ferocious attackers. War cries WHOOPING, the OTHERS TWO RIDERS continue to circle the gladiators, dust kicking from their wheels.
C: PRIEST
D: Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the harsh sun. Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the housing of the last cycle, the bike nosedives, sending the rider across the desert. Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle, VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the train...
S: EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME
N: Hicks and the Priestess are riding right beside the colossus, the sound incredible as the cars rattle across the tracks. Carefully, they pull up to the caboose.
C: PRIESTESS
D: You ready? Hicks nods, maneuvering to the side of his bike and jumping to the Priestess's, his cycle crashing into the dirt as he LEAPS onto the back of the train.
E: shouting to be heard
C: PRIESTESS
D: I'm going for the engine. Find Lucy. Before he does. Hicks nods, knowing this'll probably be the last time he sees her. And with that, she throttles forward, disappearing. Alone, Hicks takes a deep breath, looks at --
E: CONTIB about to speed off, stops
C: THE TRAIN CAR DOOR
D: Who knows what horrors lie behind it? He pops a WAD OF ATOMIC CRAW in his mouth and pulls his six shooters.
C: HICKS
D: My.tuxn now, Priest. BAMI He kicks the door in
S: INT VAMPIRE TRAIN CAR - SAME
N: Sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber, but only reaching 4 so far, as if the sun itself were scared to enter. Hicks rolls in, guns at the ready. It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust but when they do he finds a series of OLD WOODEN COFFINS stacked atop one another like cargo. He quickly moves through the car, careful not to disturb anything. We FOLLOW with him as he exits, entering --
S: INT. BLACK STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS
N: Designed so one can move between the cars without exposure to the sun, making the train a world of eternal midnight. Carefully, Hicks opens the next compartment's door.,.
S: INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: It's pitch black. The only thing we can make out is a LARGE CAGE, what's inside impossible to see in the darkness, just a GIANT HULKING C SHADOW. Its steady, hefty breathing letting us know whatever it is, it's asleep. Hicks covers his nose from the bestial smell, the cage taking up so much room he is forced to press himself against the bars, his body just inches from the thing inside. THE TWITCH OF BLACK LEATHER WINGS Makes Hicks stop in his tracks, silently praying to whoever's listening. A long moment...and then the steady breathing begins again. Whew. Hicks continues through the cabin, finally making it to the door as --
S: EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - DAY
N: The Priestess, engine at full boil, makes her way up the train, eyes on the engine up ahead. ACROSS THE BODY OF THE TRAIN A long line of tiny SLATS open up, RIFLE BARRELS quickly emerging, snapping into place with a click. BLAM! BLAMI BLAM! The guns FIRE AWAY, bullets blasting all around the Priestess, missing her by millimeters. She flicks down a TOGGLE SWITCH, there's a mighty roar, a massive surge of power and WHOOSH! she ROCKETS forward. The bullets chewing up the dirt behind her!
C: PRIEST
D: Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car riding the vampire cycle. He grabs onto a gun barrel and SWINGS into an arc, lifting himself off the bike and -

N: Lands on the roof of the train. Hard.
S: EXT. BELOW THE TRAIN - SAME TIME
N: The cycle quickly ripped apart as it falls under the juggernaut, getting crushed, sparks flying off the rails.
S: EXT. TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME
N: Priest collapses against the metal, the strain beginning to wear, he blinks up at the sky, close to passing out. Suddenly a FIGURE steps in front of him, blotting out the sun. Priest squints, unable to trust his eyes, he must be HALLUCINATING -- IT'S BLACK HAT. He looks down at Priest, bowing with a slight flourish.
C: BLACK HAT
D: "And the third day He shall rise again. Priest can't believe it, seeing his long dead comrade, his face etched with shock, all he can do is ask --
C: PRIEST
D: .How? Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Oh ye of little faith. The understanding hits Priest immediately, crashing over him like a wave.

D: No, Priest...I turned them. He smiles wider as we CROSSCUT TO:
S: INT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME
N: Hicks still hunting for Lucy, making his way to the next car. He slides open the door, stepping carefully inside, candlelight softly illuminating the space. He's greeted by a sight that makes his blood freeze: DOZENS OF OPEN COFFINS FILL THE CAR Long black boxes lined in orderly rows, flickering light bouncing warmly off their mahogany casings -- The sound of DEEP TORTURED BREATHING lets us know the OCCUPANTS are asleep. HICKS (under his breath) Shit. Gritting his teeth, he walks between the rows, quiet as possible. The interiors of the coffins are dark, hard to see what's lying inside, just that horrible breathing sound. As Hicks moves past, his body brushes the wood, the space so very tight. WHAM! The train CATCHES the rail and the car shakes, KNOCKING HIM INTO A COFFIN! Jarring it. He stops. Holding his breath...but Nothing happens. A quick Hail Mary (the man becoming more of a convert with every step) and he continues on. He doesn't notice as behind hi a PX rises from one of the, coffins
T: CROSSCUT TO:
S: EXT. TRAIN ROOF -SAME TIME
N: Priest and Black Hat eye each other, landscape whipping past at a furious rate, the train blasting along the tracks.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Lost souls abandoned by divinity. No belief, no voice to guide them through the wilderness. Sound familiar? Priest doesn't reply, warily eyeing him.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Lack of faith. That's what I found in my new brethren And so it was I discovered my true calling -- To teach. To lead.
E: CONT'D

D: By putting them in touch with a higher power.
E: CONTID
C: PRIEST
D: who?
C: BLACK HAT
D: Me. Something in the distance catches Priest's eye, a BLACK SPEC on the horizon -- It's The Cities. His jaw tightens, he knows there isn't much time.
C: PRIEST
D: So this is how you go about it? One by one killing every last remaining Priest?
C: BLACK HAT
D: It was the only way. The Cities are defenseless now...no one left to stop us from entering our Eden. But I was kind -- I gave every last one the choice I never had.
N: (SMILES) Now it's your turn. Almost imperceptibly the two make a shift in their postures, the tension between the two warming up. Two warriors steeling for a fight.
C: BLACK HAT
D: it's better to be with your enemies than to be alone, Priest. Humanity had its chance.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) It's time to make way for new blood. Priest lowers his head, when he raises it, his reply comes easy and without hesitation.
C: PRIEST
D: Yours.
C: WE HEAR A HUM
D: Molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits, the roar of the train gently subsiding as if the universe itself wants to leave these two room to battle. And before anyone knows it, they're already mid-fight. The SLAM and COLLISION of bodies giving way to the graceful sweep and echo of Priest combat.
N: Then as combustibly fast as it started -- the tableau drops. They stand, wind whipping around them in lethal currents, Black Hat having to shout to be heard.
C: BLACK HAT
D: They taught us God created man in His image. . .but they lied. Man created God in a image -- And so, like man, God is weak. Corrupt. Merciless. He wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Who do you fight for, Priest? The Order's collapsed. The Church nothing but a line of decrepit, ruined old men. Charlatans.
E: CONT'D
N: (SMILES) How do you think I'm getting into the cities? Priest's face drops.
C: PRIEST
D: I don't believe you.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Your faith has failed you Priest.
N: (BEAT) Join me. Join me and have the best of both worlds --Walk in the sun. Stalk in the night. Why pray to a God when you can BE one?
C: PRIEST
D: With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging into the metal. The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the next car. The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at j ust the right moment to land onto the next. But Priest is,outmatched. As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied.
N: Black Hat calmly approaches, his foot dangerously close to Priest's hand. The landscape below-whipping past at an incredible speed.
C: BLACK HAT
D: Your problem is you keep looking to God for-your power -- But I know the real truth.
N: (BEAT) You've been praying to an empty sky. And now he SWIPES his foot across the roof, knocking off Priest's hand as one would swat a bug. Priest falls below, getting caught under the train and quickly dragged under.
C: BLACK HAT
D: But you know that now.
E: CONT' D

N: The Priestess, cycle at full throttle, racing beside the TRAIN ENGINE. Up close it's a real mechanical monster, black metal and heat fused into a superpowered nightmare. The hull completely covered. Impervious.
C: MASSIVE PISTONS
D: Pump up and down furiously, moving so fast they blur, turning the-giant DRIVE WHEELS that power the locomotive. ANGRY BLASTS OF STEAM vent whi te hot from between the wheels, just missing the Priestess. She reaches into her pack and lugs out a CROWBAR, pulling up to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons hoping to jam up the works. The machine chews it up like candy.

S: INT. TRAIN COFFIN CAR - SAME TIME
N: Hicks is almost at the door, hand reaching for the handle. He hears a RUSTLING sound and turns to look behind him... But there's nothing, just the open coffins. Turning back, Hicks catches his breath: A VAMPIRE hangs upside down from the ceiling, blocking the door. Its red eyes snap in anticipation, a shiny BLACK PROBOSCIS darting from its mouth! Hicks SPITS a wad of ATOMIC CRAW at the creature. It RIEKSI dropping to the floor, writhing. The sick smell of cooked flesh filling the car.
C: HICKS LOOKS BEHIND HIM
D: DOZENS OF VAMPIRES ARE NOW AWAKE. Sitting up in their coffins, the foul creatures all blood-eyeing Hicks like the dinner he most surely is.
C: HICKS

N: and manages to SLAM the door behind him just in time as the hungry beings CRASH against itl He wedges a knife in the door-handle, bashing it with his revolver, jamming the door trapped shut. He turns to head to the next car but there's a THICK CHAIN AND PADLOCK wrapped around the door, aWILD-EYED FAMILIAR peering out from inside the door window. Hicks SHOOTS the padlock but no luck, it doesn't break. He's trapped. THE DOOR BEHIND HICKS BUCKLES ON ITS HINGES It'll hold. . .but not for long.
S: EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - SAME TIME
N: Priest is still alive. Barely. He hangs in tatters, desperately clinging to the undercarriage, face and body punched with bruises and blood. Jaw set, he begins to move through the undercarriage, hand over hand, every movement sheer agony.
S: INT. METAL ENCLOSURE - SAME TIME
N: Hicks stares at the door as it starts to BREAK from its hinges. He trains his gun on it, a feeble gesture --- but it's all he's got left. Then there's a horrible SCREECH.
C: HICKS TURNS
D: The WILD-EYED FAMILIAR charges, attacking from behind, having unlocked the chain and opened the door. He SCREAMS, sinking a KNIFE in Hicks' side! Hicks spins, slamming his attacker in the nose with a palm heel strike, knocking the Familiar out instantly. Hicks pulls the knife out, blood flowering across his shirt as the vampires continue to PUMMEL the door behind, him. He trips over the chain and staggers into --
S: INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Collapsing to the floor, he presses his body against the door to close it. HIS EYES SEARCH THE CAR It's bare. Absolutely nothing in here. A single candle burns: ,on the floor, dimly illuminating the room. Weakly, he crosses the space and goes to the next door. This one's got a THICK PADLOCK too,.
C: HICKS
D: 'Dam. He site on the floor, breathing hard, knowing this is as far as he goes. Gradually another sound becomes audible. Hicks listens, nervous. He holds his breath straining to hear. It's someone else's BREATHING.
C: IN THE CORNER
D: A HUNCHED FIGURE sits...its back to him. Hidden'in shadow. Hicks levels his gun, slowly moving towards the shape, the candlelight giving him a glimpse of its face. He can hardly believe it

C: THE SKYLINE,OF THE CITIES
D: Smudged like a greasestain, looms large across the horizon, right in the train's path. She squints up to the sky, analyzing the sun, making a quick series of calculationsin her head. Trajectory. Timing. Then she looks at the train. Smiles. She flicks the Nitros Toggle one last time. Her bike ROCKETS past the train engine, speeding into a curtain of dust. Disappearing...
S: INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME TIME
N: Hicks crouches beside Lucy, his gun trained on her. She site listlessly, her skin pale, eyes lost on the wall in front of her.
C: HICKS
D: Lucy, my name is Sheriff Hicks...I'm here to take you home. No response. She seems almost catatonic. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out her photograph, showing it to her.

E: CONT'D
C: WHAP!1

C: A TALON
D: Reaches through the opening, long bony fingers swiping at Hicks like switchblades as he falls backwards, pain shooting up his body. ANOTHER ARM breaks through the small window, clawing at the air, the door BANGING REPEATEDLY against the chain. Hicks places himself between Lucy and the door, not noticing as she eyes the blood soaking through his shirt.
C: HICKS
D: Stay behind me. I'll hold `em off as long as I can BLAMI BL.AM! Hicks FIRES, bullets peppering the creatures as they HOWL -- but they keep at it, the thick chain stretched tight, ready to snap.

D: Lucy? WHAM! A WOODEN. PLANK slams him over the head, knocking the gun from his hand. Woozy, he spins around to find Lucy standing over him, holding the plank above her head. He scoots back just as WHAM! the plank comes back down again, splintering apart across the floor.

D: Lucy, wait She doesn't, jabbing at him with the broken plank, he dodges it, barely, but she keeps coming.
E: CONT'D

D: PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor , wood splintering into tiny shards. Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy, knocking her unconscious. He dives for his gun, scooping it up and leveling it at the hole, ready to fire at whatever's coming through...

N: HICKS (SWALLOWS) Too late. THE CITYSCAPE t Towers above as the train approaches, so close the smell of sulphur and carbon clogs their noses. But that's when something catches Hicks' eye...up ahead on the tracks -- Someone stands. awaiting the train. IT'S THE PRIESTESS -- Standing defiant as the train barrels towards her. An ant in front of a battleship. She sees Hicks and Priest-on top of the train, Lucy with them. Taking one last look at Priest -- she smiles. And spreads her arms open.
C: ON PRIEST
D: Horrified, realizing what she's going to do...and powerless to stop her.

D: What happens next happens fast: Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy, hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as -- E ERYTH ggas BLACK The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition. A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the. Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND HER as if smashing into a building. She doesn't move. A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each other, the cars JUMPING the rails. MMMM gQES BLACK A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the earth, careening through the air.

D: He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching. A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to. A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air. Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful. Terrifying. Then in one horrible instant -- They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits.

Hicks' eyes, widen, witnessing an amazing eight as the vampires' bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm withering... quickly becoming nothing more than husks. Floating black kites. Hicks and Priest stand, surrounded by the epic destruction, fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze.
C: HICKS
D: You knew they wouldn't make it. A long time before Priest answers.
C: PRIEST
D: She knew. He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN as if smashed by the very hand of God.
C: THE PRIESTESS
D: Lies before it. Somehow not a scratch on her...But something's wrong -- something inside her broken, something elemental. She doesn't have much time. Priest kneels beside her, taking her hand. Trying to be strong for her.
C: PRIEST
D: Do you want me to?
E: CONT'D
N: PRIESTESS Priest lowers his head. The following having been spoken by him all too often.

C: PRIEST
D: .Me too. She reaches up, placing her hand on his chest.
C: PRIESTESS
D: Wherever it is we go -- we go together, right? She smiles weakly... but Priest can see she's scared. He gives her one last kiss, cradling her body, sand circling them as she draws her final breath.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE WASTELAND - DUSK
N: The sun setting on the horizon. A nearby PYRE consumes the last of the Priestess' body as Priest saddles up on a vampire bike, the flames rising behind him. Hicks approaches, Lucy huddled in a blanket, shivering. The two men exchange a look, the snap and flash of the fire reflecting in their eyes.
C: HICKS

C: KOEPPEN
D: Am I next? Priest approaches -- Koeppen closing his eyes, ready for the blow he knows is to come. But Priest only lifts the man's head, studying his neck. He's clean. And without a single word -- Priest just walks away. When Koeppen opens his eyes, he's a new man -- a man absolved. With renewed energy, he looks to the crowd around him. And for the first moment in a long time ...He believes.

D: Leans against the backwall watching. Lucy glances his way... then shyly looks away.
C: AARON
D: I can't thank you enough for what you've done, sheriff.
N: T I
C: HICKS
D: Just make sure she keeps on the tea. It's a special brew -- lessens the bloodthirst...something my granddad taught me. Aaron nods hopefully, squeezing his. daughter's hand.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OUTPOST 10 - LATER
N: A full moon. Hicks stands on the porch, enjoying the breeze as he pops a wad of chaw in his mouth. A MOVEMENT out in the darkness catches his attention. IN THE DISTANCE
C: A FIGURE
D: Stands astride a motorcycle, shadowed in the moonlight.
N: Hicks approaches, the wind kicking up, whistling through the emptiness. Even though he can't see him -- Hicks knows who it is.
C: HICKS
D: It doesn't have to be like this. Priest just stands, staring. Hick's hand curls around the revolver. Priest looks to the cabin, the challenge hanging in the air
C: THEN
D: He steps from the bike, advancing towards Hicks. Hicks pulls his gun, leveling it. Priest keeps coming, the wind blowing harder as he approaches. A feeling of inevitability. Hicks stands his ground, cocking his gun.
C: HICKS
D: D= I t- -make dQ this.
E: CONT'D
C: PRIEST
D: Stares into his eyes and -- Something passes between them something so strong and personal it transcends emotion. Hicks FIRES! But Priest is pone. Hicks looks around -- There's no sign of him, not even the bike.
N: HICKS (CONT'D) (REALIZING)
C: SHIT
D: He RACES back to the cabin...
S: INT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME
N: Hicks BURSTS through the doorway, finding LUCY AND AARON Sitting peacefully on the bed together, just as he left them. Aaron holds up the cup, turning it over.
C: AARON
D: All done.
N: (BEAT) We heard you fire your gun. is everything OK? A beat -- then Hicks nods.
C: HICKS
D: Nothing to worry about, just a coyote. Aaron smiles, happy enough to be with Lucy.
C: AARON
D: Well ...we're all God's creatures. Hicks turns, ready to leave, but something on the table catches his eye
N: THE DESERT RAT' S HOMEMADE CROSS He picks it up, turning it in his hand, the colored stones 0 catching the moonlight...How the hell did it get there?
C: AARON
D: Don't forget your cross -- It's beautiful. A flicker of a smile crosses Hick's face, realizing.
E: CONT'D
N: HICKS ACTUALLY -- (BEAT) I think it's for you...and Lucy.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT
N: Alone in the darkness, Priest sits on his cycle, his hand clutching the WELL-WORN PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY. His eyes shift, gazing into the distance at the outpost, a warm glow emanating from within the cabin. He places the photo in his pocket. The wind making a high, lonely sound. VRR00000MI Priest streaks into the night, bathed in moonlight, desolation opening around him. He disappears into the emptiness.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT
N: The vampire train. A car lies half-buried in the sand, mangled cage within.
C: A BLACK CLAW
D: Emerges from inside, clamping onto metal, something dragging itself out into the moonlight. It's a PUREBLOOD. With a SCREECH it takes to the night sky, massive black wings fluttering, arcing towards the twinkling metropolis.
T: FADE OUT
