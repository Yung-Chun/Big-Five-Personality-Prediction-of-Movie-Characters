M: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01
T: FADE IN:
N: EMPTY ROOM WITH SINGLE CHAIR We hear a DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, followed by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DANNY OCEAN, dressed in prison fatigues, ENTERS FRAME and sits.
C: VOICE
D: Good morning.
E: O.S.
C: DANNY
D: Good morning.
C: VOICE
D: Please state your name for the record.
E: O.S.
C: DANNY
D: Daniel Ocean.
C: VOICE
D: Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this?
E: O.S.
C: DANNY
D: As you say, ma'am, I was never charged.
S: INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING
N: Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table. BOARD MEMBER #2 Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time?
C: DANNY
D: My wife left me. I was upset. I got into a self-destructive pattern.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 2. BOARD MEMBER #3 If released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern?
C: DANNY
D: She already left me once. I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks.
N: Glances dart between the Board Members. BOARD MEMBER #1 Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released? Danny considers.
C: DANNY
D: I don't know. How much do you guys make a year?
E: deadpan
S: INT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - CHECK-OUT STATION - DAY
N: GUARD #2 Ocean, Daniel. Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to Danny. GUARD #2 Sign. (adding a piece of mail to the pile) This came today for you. Rest'll be forwarded to your parole officer. GUARD #1 (reading its return address over Danny's shoulder) Those your lawyers?
C: DANNY
D: My wife's.
N: He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little. GUARD #1 What's it say? OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 3.
C: DANNY
D: I'm a free man.
S: INT. CHANGING CUBICLE
N: Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?
S: EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON
N: A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it: "If you were in prison, you'd be home now." The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.) He hovers there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom. The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of the gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey): Life is hard out there. But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America...
S: A6 EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK A6
N: Any empty wintery boardwalk.
S: INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT
N: ... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting. As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS. And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy. He's home. ON DANNY'S WALLET As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of chips. AT BLACKJACK TABLE Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but without success. He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer. Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins. King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts. Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again. A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar face is welcome.
C: DANNY
D: Hello, Frank.
N: The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He quickly hides his astonishment.
C: FRANK
D: I beg your pardon, sir. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ramon. See?
N: He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit boss circles close by and glares at them both.
C: DANNY
D: My mistake... Table's cold anyway.
E: collecting his chips, doubled
C: FRANK
D: You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir. It gets busy around one.
C: DANNY
D: Thanks.
E: as he goes
S: INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND
N: Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon, folds back the New York Times and scans. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 5. His eyes move down the page and stop at a header -- "Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs... The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former owner, Reuben Tishkoff.
C: FRANK
D: Catching up on current events?
E: O.S.
N: Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him, changed out of his dealer's threads.
C: DANNY
D: Ramon?
C: FRANK
D: Glad to meet you. Frank Catton wouldn't get by the gaming board. You just out?
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: This afternoon.
C: FRANK
D: And already turning over a new leaf.
E: re: Danny's drink and whereabouts
N: Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.
C: DANNY
D: You seen him?
E: directly, this is why he's here
C: FRANK
D: Last I heard he was in L.A. Teaching movie stars how to play cards. Why? You don't have something planned already?
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: You kidding? I just became a citizen again.
N: Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye, and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 6. Frank turns his eyes to heaven...
C: FRANK
D: Jesus...
S: INT. SUB SHOP - NIGHT
N: MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.
C: FRANK
D: It's tough now, our line of work. Everybody so serious. Too many guns, too many computers. Whadda you gonna do? Steal from ordinary people?
C: DANNY
D: That would be criminal.
C: FRANK
D: So what's left? Banks? Hah. Banks got no money. It's all electronic. Only place that still takes cash is...
C: DANNY
D: Casinos.
C: FRANK
D: Oh, no...
E: realizing
C: DANNY
D: Oh, yes...
C: FRANK
D: When?
C: DANNY
D: Soon. Interested?
N: Frank smiles. Danny has his answer.
S: INT. SUB SHOP - FOYER - NIGHT
N: Danny pulls a business card from his jacket, picks up the phone again, and dials the card's number. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 7.
C: DANNY
D: Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is Danny Ocean. I'm just out, I'm supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours. No, sir, I haven't gotten into any trouble. No drinking, no sir. No, sir, I wouldn't even think of leaving the state.
E: listens listens, finishes his bourbon
N: OFF the sound of a JET fly-over we...
T: CUT TO:
S: A11 EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT A11
N: PULLING OFF the Capitol Building, we PICK UP Rusty (tall, angular, ebony) leaning against his Ford Falcon.
C: TOPHER
D: Hey! Hey, Rusty!
E: O.S.
N: Rusty turns to the voice and --
T: CUT TO:
N: ANOTHER ANGLE MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push down a back alley.
C: TOPHER
D: Hey, I don't know if you're, uh, you know, incorporated or anything, like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know, incorporated, but you should think about it, really, 'cause I was talking to my manager yesterday --
C: RUSTY
D: Bernie?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 8. A11 CONTINUED: A11
C: TOPHER
D: No, not Bernie, I mean not, not that Bernie, my business manager, he's also Bernie, he was telling me that since this, what we do, could be considered research for, you know, a future gig, that I should be able to write it off as a business expense. So he suggested that it'd be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby --
N: Rusty looks at him: are you stoned?
C: TOPHER
D: Or, or we could keep it cash.
N: By this time, they should have entered --
S: A12 INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT A12
N: -- where they must weave through hordes of young Hollywood nightclubbers.
C: RUSTY
D: Alright. Who's here?
C: TOPHER
D: Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn't make it. He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany.
C: RUSTY
D: That's a problem.
C: TOPHER
D: Barry is here.
C: RUSTY
D: I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.
C: TOPHER
D: Couldn't work the dates. Oh, and he brought his girlfriend.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 9. A12 CONTINUED: A12
C: RUSTY
D: Not the one from --
C: TOPHER
D: Uh-huh.
C: RUSTY
D: I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident.
E: beat
N: They pass on, and into --
S: A13 INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT A13
N: Small but stylish. Rusty enters, Topher in tow.
C: RUSTY
D: Good evening, guys. Let's play some cards...
N: A glance at the table reveals: the three waiting players are all young TV stars (Josh Jackson, Seth Green, Barry Watson) here for a group poker lesson with Rusty. (One star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, Katie, also a known actress, to observe.) A glance back at Rusty reveals: he's in for a long night.
C: RUSTY
D: ... and let's play some cards.
N: AT TABLE - LATER The group lesson has begun.
C: TOPHER
D: A hundred bucks to me... Ah, what the hell. Pocket change. Call.
E: mulling it over
N: Rusty leans into Topher's ear, whispering: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 10. A13 CONTINUED: A13
C: RUSTY
D: Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. Understand?
N: SAME SCENE - LATER To another player:
C: RUSTY
D: Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them doesn't change them. Leave 'em where they are and make your bet.
N: SAME SCENE - LATER To another player:
C: RUSTY
D: You're showing. Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't... Thank you.
N: SAME SCENE - LATER To another:
C: RUSTY
D: Josh. Deal to your left.
N: SAME SCENE - LATER A WAITRESS enters from the club, and DANCE MUSIC with her. As she distributes a fresh round:
C: WAITRESS
D: One McCallum neat. And four bottled waters.
N: Rusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a poker table.
C: SETH
D: Two pair -- nines and twos.
E: triumphantly
N: Rusty checks his hand: a full-house full of face cards. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 11. A13 CONTINUED: (2) A13
C: RUSTY
D: You got me. Let's take a little break.
E: folding as Seth rakes in his winnings
S: A14 INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT A14
N: At the bar, Rusty orders a double. He needs it.
C: BARTENDER
D: How's the game going?!!
E: shouting over music
C: RUSTY
D: It's been the longest hour of my life.
C: BARTENDER
D: What?!
C: RUSTY
D: I'm running away with your wife.
E: at the same volume
N: The Bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes a thumbs-up before moving away.
C: BARTENDER
D: Cool, man!
N: Behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light- district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued expression in their reflection. Then, out the corner of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through the pulsating crowd. Someone familiar to him. He follows.
S: A15 INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - BACK ROOM A15
N: Rusty returns.
C: TOPHER
D: Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that's alright.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12. A15 CONTINUED: A15 Topher indicates the new arrival: Danny. Rusty looks as if there's a bad smell in the room.
C: RUSTY
D: What's this?
C: DANNY
D: The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. I hope I'm not intruding.
C: TOPHER
D: No intrusion at all --
C: RUSTY
D: What was his name, the bouncer's?
C: DANNY
D: I don't remember.
C: RUSTY
D: A card player with amnesia. This should be fun.
N: AT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER Rusty deals the next hand.
C: TOPHER
D: What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean? If you don't mind my asking.
C: DANNY
D: Why should I mind? Two cards, please... I just got out of prison.
E: long beat
C: TOPHER
D: Really? Really...
E: a glance among the other players
C: RUSTY
D: Barry, you're showing again.
E: half to divert attention
C: BARRY
D: Sorry.
E: O.S.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12A. A15 CONTINUED: (2) A15
C: JOSH
D: What'd you, uh, go to prison for?
C: DANNY
D: I stole things.
C: JOSH
D: What, like jewels? Diamonds?
N: A beat, then:
C: RUSTY
D: Incan matrimonial headmasks.
N: Looks are exchanged. Everyone digests that.
C: JOSH
D: From a museum?
C: DANNY
D: Gallery.
C: SETH
D: There a lot of money in those? Incan matrimonial...
C: DANNY
D: Headmasks. Some.
C: RUSTY
D: Don't let him fool you, Seth. There's boatloads. If you can move the things... One card to me. ... but you can't.
E: finishing his deal to Danny, pointedly
C: DANNY
D: My fence seemed confident enough.
C: RUSTY
D: If you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence.
C: DANNY
D: Some people just lack vision.
C: RUSTY
D: Probably everybody in cell block E.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12B. A15 CONTINUED: (3) A15 Now the other players realize. These guys have a relationship. In fact, a criminal one. And, judging from their steely glares across the table, not a happy one.
C: DANNY
D: Well, that's all behind us now.
C: RUSTY
D: I should hope so.
N: Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls out his wallet.
C: DANNY
D: I raise you five hundred dollars.
N: A hush in the room. Danny has thrown down the gauntlet. He and Rusty hold each other's stares.
C: RUSTY
D: Guys: Day One: what's the first rule of poker?
C: BARRY TOPHER
D: Um, never bet on, uh, on 'Leave emotion at the a -- door.'
C: RUSTY
D: That's right. My friend here just raised me out of pique. Today's lesson. How to draw out a bluff. This early in the game, that much money, I'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards. Seth, raise him.
E: beat beat
C: SETH
D: Okay. Uh, your five hundred and... another two?
N: Rusty nods, and Seth pushes in his chips.
C: RUSTY
D: Tophe...
C: TOPHER
D: Seven to me. Plus three. What the hell.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12C. A15 CONTINUED: (4) A15
C: RUSTY
D: Indeed. But be careful you don't push him too high too fast. Want to keep him on the leash. I call.
N: It's Josh's turn. He hesitates...
C: JOSH
D: What's that to me? A thousand?
C: RUSTY
D: All you have to do is call.
C: DANNY
D: What? Your girlfriend holding your purse?
E: off Josh's further hesitation
N: That does it. Josh is in. The bet's to Danny. He checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.
C: DANNY
D: Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better. Five hundred to call. And two grand more.
E: digging his wallet out
N: Danny stares Rusty down. The others look a little pale.
C: RUSTY
D: Guys, you're free to do what you like. It's a lot of money. But I'm staying in. He's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.
N: Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to leave a grand on the table, either. Finally, Seth ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.
C: RUSTY
D: We call.
N: Danny sets down his hand. Four nines. It's a winner. The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. For the first time tonight, Rusty blanches. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12D. A15 CONTINUED: (5) A15
C: RUSTY
D: Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was sure he was bluffing.
N: As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, Danny rakes in his pot.
C: DANNY
D: Thanks for the game, fellas. Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? It's for the guys in the joint. They just love all your shows.
E: then
S: A16 EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT A16
N: A queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as Topher and company exit, and they begin signing autographs. Danny and Rusty exit, too, but of course nobody gives a shit about them.
S: INT. RUSTY'S FALCON - MOVING - NIGHT
N: Danny and Rusty ride silently, staring out opposite windows at Sunset Boulevard.
C: RUSTY
D: That was, that was just...
C: DANNY
D: Unprofessional.
N: Rusty agrees.
C: RUSTY
D: How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent you?
C: DANNY
D: Why do you think I came to see you first?
N: Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off half, and hands it to Rusty.
C: DANNY
D: Ten grand. Half of it's yours.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 12E.
C: RUSTY
D: You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you've got something better for me.
C: DANNY
D: I've got something better for you.
S: INT. CANTER'S DELI - NIGHT
N: They're sitting in a booth over coffee.
C: RUSTY
D: How's Tess?
N: Danny stares at him: next subject, please.
C: RUSTY
D: Alright. Tell me.
C: DANNY
D: It's tricky. No one's ever done it before. Needs planning, a large crew.
C: RUSTY
D: Guns?
C: DANNY
D: Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There's a lot of security. But the take...
C: RUSTY
D: What's the target?
C: DANNY
D: Eight figures each.
C: RUSTY
D: What's. The. Target.
C: DANNY
D: When's the last time you were in Vegas?
E: deep breath, then
C: RUSTY
D: What? You wanna knock over a casino?
N: Danny puts down his coffee. And shakes his head. And lifts three fingers: three casinos. Rusty must put down his coffee, too.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT
N: It's after hours downtown. Dark, empty, dead...
S: INT. LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: Lights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces: J.A. KUEHN & ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS. Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance. As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to its out box. At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.
C: DANNY
D: The vault at the Bellagio.
N: A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another underneath it.
C: RUSTY
D: If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. Oops. Actually, you know what, I'm wrong. It's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed.
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: Yep.
N: Rusty's brow furrows just a little. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 14.
C: RUSTY
D: You said three casinos...
C: DANNY
D: These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand. But every dime ends up here.
E: flips to next blueprint tapping vault
C: RUSTY
D: The Bellagio, Mirage, and... These are Terry Benedict's places.
C: DANNY
D: Yes, they are. Think he'll mind?
C: RUSTY
D: More than somewhat.
N: AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY No ding. The elevator just arrives. Its doors part to reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a large fellow, he has to duck to exit. BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers the plan (which, in our absence, Danny has pitched him).
C: RUSTY
D: You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.
C: DANNY
D: Like what, you think?
C: RUSTY
D: Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this?
E: beat
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 15.
C: DANNY
D: As long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.
C: RUSTY
D: But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose... Aha.
E: smiles, realizing
C: DANNY
D: Aha.
E: smiles, too
C: RUSTY
D: Reuben.
N: MOVING WITH SECURITY GUARD as he approaches Danny's and Rusty's voices... BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY
C: DANNY
D: So...
C: RUSTY
D: So, here's what I think: You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then: never bring it up to me again.
C: DANNY
D: Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
C: RUSTY
D: I'm saying: this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.
C: DANNY
D: Really? I thought it was much harder than that --
N: Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes. Danny and Rusty put their hands up to block the light.
C: DANNY
D: Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 16.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Sorry. You two done up here? Find what you wanted?
E: lowers beam
C: DANNY
D: Yeah, thanks. You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? Make some copies.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Whatever you need.
N: Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard's hand.
C: DANNY
D: 'Preciate it.
N: AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator. When its doors open, Rusty stops Danny from boarding.
C: RUSTY
D: I need a reason. And don't say money. Why do this?
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: Why not do it?
N: Rusty stares at him: enough bullshitting around.
C: DANNY
D: Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys. Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. And then you take the house.
E: beat
N: A beat. Rusty smiles.
C: RUSTY
D: You're been practicing that speech, haven't you?
C: DANNY
D: A little. Did I rush it? It felt like I rushed it.
C: RUSTY
D: No, it was good.
N: They step aboard the elevator. As the door closes:
C: RUSTY
D: I wonder what Reuben will say?
N: Danny and Rusty look at each other.
C: TISHKOFF
D: You're out of your goddamn minds.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. TISHKOFF'S OPULENT BACK YARD (LAS VEGAS) - DAY
N: REUBEN TISHKOFF, the grimace of a man in mid-movement, forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch guests (Danny and Rusty) at his poolside.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Are you listening to me? You are, both of you, nuts. I know more about casino security than any man alive. I invented it, and it cannot be beaten. They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris. Okay, bad example...
C: DANNY
D: It's never been tried.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Oh, it's been tried. A few guys even came close. You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas history?
S: FLASHBACK - INT. SANDS CASINO FLOOR (1965)
N: An Adlai Stevenson-lookalike approaches a lockbox carrier from behind and snatches the box. He takes almost three steps before five security men leap at him and -- FREEZE FRAME on his wide-eyed expression of horror...
C: TISHKOFF
D: Number three. The bronze medal. Pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the Sands. He got two steps closer to the door than any living soul before him.
E: V.O.
N: RESUME ACTION: Adlai Stevenson gets a taste of what NFL quarterbacks experience every Sunday... five fold.
S: INT. FLAMINGO CASINO FLOOR (1971)
N: A hippie races toward the electronic sliding doors, clutching a tray full of chips, and as the doors begin to part for him -- FREEZE FRAME: A billy club appears out of nowhere...
C: TISHKOFF
D: Second most successful robbery. The Flamingo '71. This guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got him.
E: V.O.
N: RESUME ACTION: The billy club comes down -- whap! -- across the hippie's skull and it's Chicago '68 all over again.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Course, he was breathing out of a hose the next three weeks, goddamn hippie.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. REUBEN TISHKOFF'S BACK YARD - DAY (PRESENT)
C: TISHKOFF
D: And the closest any man has gotten to robbing a Las Vegas casino...
S: FLASHBACK - EXT. CAESAR'S PALACE ENTRANCE (1987)
N: Tourists and valets scatter as a Euro-thief (pastel T-shirt beneath a white linen suit) bursts from the casino and takes five steps before -- FREEZE FRAME: GLASS EXPLODES from three different doors behind him and he arches his back in agony...
C: TISHKOFF
D: Outside of Caesar's in '87. He came, he grabbed, he got conquered.
N: RESUME ACTION: BULLETS rip the man to shreds and he collapses on Caesar's steps a bloody pulp.
S: EXT. REUBEN TISHKOFF'S BACK YARD - DAY (PRESENT)
C: TISHKOFF
D: But what am I saying? You guys are pros, the best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert!
N: Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.
C: RUSTY
D: You're right. He's right.
E: to Danny
C: DANNY
D: Reuben, you're right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.
C: RUSTY
D: That's exactly it. Pure ego.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Yeah yeah blah blah.
C: DANNY
D: Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you.
N: They both rise to go.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Look, we all go way back. I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it.
C: DANNY
D: It was our pleasure.
C: RUSTY
D: I'd never been to Belize.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you.
N: Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave. Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob?
N: Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this question, which of course he has.
C: DANNY
D: The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.
E: nostrils flared, smelling a rat
C: RUSTY
D: Say, you know, he's right.
N: Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed cocktail.
C: TISHKOFF
D: You guys... Whadda you got against Terry Benedict?
C: DANNY
D: What do you have against him? That's the real question.
C: TISHKOFF
D: He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I don't see what you're doin'.
C: RUSTY
D: What are we doing, Reuben?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 21.
C: TISHKOFF
D: You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. Done. But Benedict... At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you.
E: bristles
C: DANNY
D: That's why we've got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you have in mind?
E: pregnant silence
N: Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish. And so it begins...
C: RUSTY
D: Alright. Who's in?
E: V.O.
C: DANNY
D: Frank C. is in.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CASINO OFFICE (ATLANTIC CITY)
N: Frank Catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief. Across a desk, his boss fills out paperwork.
C: DANNY
D: Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY
N: Frank carries his bag toward the taxi bay. He stops to light a cigarette, inhales with deep satisfaction before a banner: "WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS."
C: DANNY
D: What about drivers?
E: V.O.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 22.
S: EXT. VACANT, WEEDY DRAG RACETRACK - DAY
N: CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross it. Now take a step back... That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper. It's a remote-controlled toy. The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race. The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really. Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.
C: RUSTY
D: I talked to the Malloys yesterday.
E: V.O.
C: DANNY
D: The Mormon twins?
E: V.O.
C: RUSTY
D: They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours.
E: V.O.
N: Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead. It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his brother's vehicle. Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.
C: DANNY
D: Electronics?
E: V.O.
C: RUSTY
D: Livingston Dell.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY
N: On a black and white monitor: Two mobsters, on a meet in a public park, peer over their shoulders, making certain no one is watching them. Little do they know... ... LIVINGSTON DELL, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a continual flop sweat, crouches before their image, masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a joystick in his left hand. He is flanked by FBI MEN. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 23.
C: RUSTY
D: Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad.
E: V.O.
C: DANNY
D: How are his nerves?
E: V.O.
C: RUSTY
D: Okay. Not so bad you'd notice.
E: V.O. beat
N: As a FBI Man reaches to adjust a monitor...
C: LIVINGSTON
D: D-don't, don't-don't... touch... it.
N: FBI MAN #1 What?
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Do you see me pulling the gun out of your holster and firing it?
N: FBI MAN #2 Hey, Radio Shack: relax.
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA BOARDWALK - LATER
N: Livingston walks down the boardwalk. A rollerblader with a dog on a leash approaches and Livingston gets caught between the two. As he struggles to untangle himself from the leash...
S: INT. CAFE
N: With a view of Livingston on the boardwalk... Danny and Rusty wait for him over espressos.
C: RUSTY
D: Munitions.
E: next item on his list
C: DANNY
D: Phil Turentine.
C: RUSTY
D: Dead.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 23A.
C: DANNY
D: No shit? On the job?
C: RUSTY
D: Sun cancer.
C: DANNY
D: You send flowers?
C: RUSTY
D: Dated his wife a while.
C: DANNY
D: Basher...
E: onto next candidate
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 24.
C: RUSTY
D: We may be too late.
E: checks his watch
S: INT. BANK - CLOSE ON BASHER TARR - NIGHT
N: the explosives expert. A pair of goggles over his eyes reflects a match being struck, then touched to a fuse.
C: BASHER
D: Sweet...
N: BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around; Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. As the dust settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into (what the settling fog now reveals to be) a dynamited bank vault. ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news.
C: BASHER
D: You know, you guys had one job to do.
E: to the rest of his gang, his temper flaring
S: EXT. BANK - ONE MINUTE LATER
N: The men exit through the front doors, their hands over their heads, Basher trailing them. Policemen and SWAT members encircle the group, weapons trained on them, chock full of instructions.
S: EXT. POLICE CAR - LATER
N: Basher sits in the rear, handcuffed behind his back, feet on the pavement. An explosives COP kneels in front of him. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 25.
C: COP
D: And that's all you used during the event? Nothing else?
C: BASHER
D: Are you accusing me of booby- trapping?
C: COP
D: Well, how 'bout it?
C: VOICE
D: Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
E: O.S.
N: The Cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is Rusty, in a dark suit and shades.
C: RUSTY
D: Isn't that right, Basher?
C: BASHER
D: That's right.
C: RUSTY
D: Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a guess. A simple G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. That's our man. Tell me something else. Have you checked him for booby traps on his person? I mean really checked, not just for weapons...
E: flashing badge, briefly off Cop's reaction
N: The Cop looks bewildered. Rusty steps forward, yanks Basher onto his feet, spins him around. He moves his hands up and down Basher's legs, around his waist, under his arms.
C: RUSTY
D: Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need to see him?
C: COP
D: Who?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 26.
C: RUSTY
D: Just go find him, will you? How fast can you put something together with what I passed you?
E: loud as Cop stalks off; under his breath
C: BASHER
D: Done. Thirty seconds all right?
C: RUSTY
D: From when?
C: BASHER
D: Now.
E: as we hear something SNAP from behind his back
N: MOVING WITH RUSTY AND BASHER They're hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars, a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.
C: RUSTY
D: Ten seconds?
C: BASHER
D: Not quite. Is Danny here?
C: RUSTY
D: Around the corner.
C: BASHER
D: Be good working with professionals again. Okay: go.
E: beat
N: And they both start running.
C: RUSTY
D: Everyone down! Get down! There's a bomb in the...
N: And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG! A collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks, cops hit the ground and cover their heads. Rusty and Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs like tires on an obstacle course. By the time the Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they've both disappeared. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 27.
S: INT. UNDER BIG TOP - DAY
N: The Chinese National Circus, currently on tour in the Western United States. Trapeze artists, gymnastic teams, and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and swing through the air. A full house applauds every feat. Danny and Rusty sit in the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on spindles of cotton candy. Tough guys in toyland.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing Yen.
E: V.O. in Chinese, then English
N: A funambulist (YEN) begins his high-wire act...
C: DANNY
D: So he can walk on a rope.
C: RUSTY
D: More than that.
C: DANNY
D: So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list?
C: RUSTY
D: He is the list.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 28.
C: DANNY
D: Who else?
C: RUSTY
D: Watch.
N: Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance. Even Danny is impressed.
C: RUSTY
D: There's your grease man.
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Danny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car.
C: DANNY
D: We need Saul.
C: RUSTY
D: He won't come. He swore off the game a year ago.
C: DANNY
D: He get religion?
C: RUSTY
D: Ulcers.
C: DANNY
D: You can ask him.
N: Rusty stops, stares at Danny, sighs.
C: RUSTY
D: I can ask.
S: EXT. DOG TRACK/BETTING WINDOW (MIAMI, FLA) - DAY
N: SAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off... THROUGH TRACK LOBBY Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul disappears into the tunnel, he moves. IN INFIELD Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps under the box seats. He produces an orange from his pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but doesn't turn around.
C: SAUL
D: I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning.
C: RUSTY
D: How ya been, Saul?
C: SAUL
D: Never better.
C: RUSTY
D: What's with the orange?
C: SAUL
D: My doctor says I need vitamins.
C: RUSTY
D: So why don't you take vitamins?
N: For the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a look up at Rusty.
C: SAUL
D: You come here to give me a physical?
C: RUSTY
D: I got a box seat. Come on.
S: EXT. BOX SEATS - LATER
N: A waiter serves coffee to Rusty and Saul.
C: RUSTY
D: I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul.
C: SAUL
D: A man shouldn't drink on the job.
C: RUSTY
D: Who we rooting for here?
E: re: race
C: SAUL
D: Number four.
N: There's the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and the dogs break out of the gate. From this point on Saul's eyes never leave the race.
C: SAUL
D: You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and get it over with?
C: RUSTY
D: Saul, you're the best there is. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want?
C: SAUL
D: Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's. I've changed.
C: RUSTY
D: Guys like us don't change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change.
C: SAUL
D: Quit connin' me.
N: They watch the race.
C: RUSTY
D: That your hound way in the back there?
C: SAUL
D: He breaks late. Everyone knows this.
N: On the track: The dogs are now coming around the back stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.
C: SAUL
D: You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is?
N: Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting. Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line... last by several lengths. Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a ticket to Las Vegas.
C: DANNY
D: And Saul makes ten.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BAR - NIGHT
N: Danny and Rusty look weary from all this recruitment. A nearby TV with the sound off plays a promo for an upcoming Tyson fight.
C: DANNY
D: Ten should do it, don't you think? You think we need one more? You think we need one more. Okay. We'll get one more.
E: as Rusty shrugs as Rusty shrugs as Rusty shrugs
S: INT. CROWDED SUBWAY CAR (CHICAGO)
N: Native Chicagoans demonstrate their indigenous sixth sense -- L-car balance -- as the TRAIN bends and SHAKES at a corner. One passenger in particular keeps his footing, a young man in a frayed jacket: LINUS. Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets. The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with a flick of his thumb and forefinger. From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss, and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems... A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld, lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus. It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is aware of the ongoing heist. Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight, but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when the train hits another curve... ... he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man of his wallet.
C: LINUS
D: Sorry 'bout that.
C: STOCKBROKER
D: No problem, guy.
N: The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his arm as...
S: INT. UNION STATION - SUBWAY STATION
N: ... The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop. Linus jumps out, leaving his prey aboard, and a few moments later, Danny steps off, too.
S: INT. UNION STATION - EVENING
N: The hurly-burly of rush hour in Union Station. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 33. Commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious schedules, and Linus slips blithely through them, in no hurry, a man who's pulled this job a thousand times before. He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times tucked under his arm), he escapes the station without incident.
S: EXT. UNION STATION - EVENING
N: Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count his winnings. And his face falls. All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card. On one side, in engraved printing: "DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice pull. Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division."
S: INT. MURPHY'S BAR - FIVE MINUTES LATER
N: On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk Guinness. Linus enters the front door, cases the joint, spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.
C: DANNY
D: Hi, Linus. Sit down.
C: LINUS
D: Who are you?
C: DANNY
D: A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. Sit down.
N: Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he sits.
C: DANNY
D: Bobby told me about you. Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.
C: LINUS
D: That wasn't work, that was practice.
N: Danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on the table. He keeps his hand over it.
C: DANNY
D: You're either in or out, right now.
C: LINUS
D: What is it?
C: DANNY
D: A plane ticket. A job offer.
C: LINUS
D: You're pretty trusting pretty fast.
C: DANNY
D: Bobby has every faith in you.
C: LINUS
D: Fathers are like that. He didn't tell you? He doesn't like me trading on his name.
E: off Danny's reaction as Danny shakes his head
C: DANNY
D: You do this job, he'll be trading on yours.
C: LINUS
D: What if I say no?
C: DANNY
D: We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.
N: Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet. It's one or the other. A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill. When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone. Linus is reading it.
C: DANNY
D: That's the best lift I've seen you make yet.
C: LINUS
D: Las Vegas, huh?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 35.
C: DANNY
D: America's playground.
N: And our MAIN THEME KICKS IN as we...
T: CUT TO:
N: LAS VEGAS - AERIAL VIEW - ESTABLISHING - DUSK The city looms out of the desert like an infernal machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon fortress. One thing in particular catches our eye: an enormous billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis. Below it, a promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call girls.
S: INT. REUBEN TISHKOFF'S MANSION (LAS VEGAS) - NIGHT
N: Frank Catton is already here, mixing a drink, when -- DING DONG -- the DOORBELL CHIMES. Tishkoff shuffles toward the front (he's given the help the night off) and opens his door to find...
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Trick or treat.
N: ... Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus crowding his doormat. A taxi-van pulls away behind them.
C: TISHKOFF
D: What, you guys get a group rate or something?
S: INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while Virgil and Turk pile shrimp onto plates, Saul pockets an orange for later.
C: TURK
D: You make it out to Utah much, Saul?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 36.
C: SAUL
D: Not as much as I'd like.
E: last man you'd see in the Tabernacle
C: TURK
D: You should. You'd like it. You'd like Provo.
C: VIRGIL
D: Anybody see the salsa goes with this?
E: scarfing a jumbo shrimp
N: At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment. In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. Until...
C: DANNY
D: Gentlemen: welcome to Las Vegas.
E: O.S.
N: Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the room, flanked by Rusty and Tishkoff. He starts down...
C: DANNY
D: Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago.
N: Linus trades nods around the room.
C: DANNY
D: Okay. Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me.
E: pauses, soberly
N: He turns and walks out of the living room, into another. Rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye over the assembled and keeps going. The guys look each other over, sizing things up. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 37.
C: BASHER
D: What the hell.
N: And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.
C: LINUS
D: Hi.
C: TISHKOFF
D: You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh?
C: LINUS
D: Yeah.
C: TISHKOFF
D: From Chicago?
C: LINUS
D: Yeah.
C: TISHKOFF
D: It's nice there. You like it?
C: LINUS
D: Yeah.
C: TISHKOFF
D: That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn room.
S: INT. GAME ROOM
N: A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here. Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas: three casinos and hotels with the Strip running between them. As the eleven surround the table and the model...
C: DANNY
D: Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 38. Danny removes the Strip from the model. Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault.
C: DANNY
D: Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. And we're going to rob it.
E: beat
N: Everyone takes a breath, awed.
C: LINUS
D: Smash-and-grab job, huh?
C: RUSTY
D: It's a little more complicated than that.
N: Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs.
C: DANNY
D: Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.
N: On the monitors: three montages of black-and-white security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages, moving into the tunnels, then (as the TVs unite in their images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the vault. As the group's glances shoot back and forth from the TV to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...
C: DANNY
D: Okay. Bad news first. This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. First: we have to get within the casino cages --
C: RUSTY
D: -- here, here, and here --
E: indicating
C: DANNY
D: -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications --
C: RUSTY
D: -- which we can't fake --
C: DANNY
D: -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
C: RUSTY
D: -- which we won't get.
C: DANNY
D: Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --
C: RUSTY
D: -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped.
C: DANNY
D: Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 40. Silence. For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself. At last, one speaks up... The Amazing Yen. In Cantonese. Of course, no one understands him. Except Rusty.
C: RUSTY
D: No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. Anyone else?
E: in response
N: Another silence. Either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak.
C: TURK
D: You said something about good news...
C: DANNY
D: The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat. Now there are eleven of us. Each with an equal share. You do the math.
E: smiles, happy someone asked gazing about room
N: MOVING AROUND the table ON ten faces, as everyone does precisely that, in their heads, except for Virgil who does it on his fingers. He whistles.
C: RUSTY
D: That's what I said.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 41-43. Everyone seems suitably impressed by their share.
C: SAUL
D: I have a question. Say we do get into the cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can't open...
E: as Danny turns to him
C: RUSTY
D: Without being seen by the cameras.
C: DANNY
D: Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to mention that.
E: off everyone's astonishment
C: SAUL
D: Say we do all that. We're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped?
N: Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one Rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny now.
C: DANNY
D: Yeah.
N: Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.
C: DANNY
D: Alright. Here's how we'll begin.
S: INT. MGM GRAND CASINO - DAY
N: MOVING WITH a cash cart as security guards push it past tourists, past cocktail waitresses, past Linus sitting at a blackjack table.
C: DANNY
D: First task: reconnaissance. I want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos. From the rotation of the dealers to the path of every cash cart...
E: V.O.
S: INT. BELLAGIO - BREAK ROOM - DAY
N: Two security TECHNICIANS on a smoke break grumble about their sex lives. Across the room, Frank sits innocently doing a crossword.
C: DANNY
D: I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass. I wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee...
E: V.O.
N: BETTER VIEW REVEALS: On his crossword, Frank has scribbled a transcript of the Technicians' conversation. As he glances up at an electronic keycard clipped to one Technician's belt...
S: INT. MIRAGE CASINO - DAY
N: ... an identical keycard is swiped through a keypad, its light flashing red to green, admitting a guard into an "Employees Only" doorway. The Malloys, who've shadowed the guard here, note a sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security camera embedded in the ceiling above: No one walks through that portal unchecked.
C: DANNY
D: Most of all, I want you guys to know these casinos. They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. I want you guys to know the quick routes out.
E: V.O.
N: Their job done, the Malloys start toward the casino's exit... in different directions. They begin to argue: The exit's that way -- no, it's that way.
S: EXT. LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD - OUTSIDE THREE CASINOS - DAY
N: With two dozen other tourists, Basher crosses the street and when he meets a manhole cover he stops and, extracting a small metal hook from his jacket, removes it from its perch, so casual about the action that no passerby looks twice at him.
C: DANNY
D: Second task: power. On the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city. Basher, it's your show.
E: V.O.
N: Basher drops into the hole, pulling the cover over him, as we PULL UP OVER the Bellagio and...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: Dozens of monitors manned by dozens of watchers canvas dozens of casino tables; only NASA's control rooms house more technology. Apart from the fray, another bank of monitors manned by two watchers (let's call them, for no particular reason, FAT and SLIM) oversee a different section of the casino: the cage, its tunnels, the elevator, and the vault it leads to; everything, in fact, which our team saw in the game room.
C: DANNY
D: Third task: surveillance. Casino security has an eye and ear on everything, so we'll want an eye and ear on them. Livingston...
E: V.O.
S: INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SET OF
N: SCHEMATICS OF BELLAGIO - NIGHT A page of the set Danny and Rusty "borrowed" from Kuehn & Associates. Danny and Livingston study it. WIDER
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Well, it's not the least accessible system I've seen, but it's close. I don't suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into?
N: Danny shakes his head: no such luck.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Then this is definitely a black bag job. Do they employ an in- house technician?
N: Danny looks to Rusty who, behind them, tampers with Livingston's audio-video setup: several portable monitors, a laptop and modem, telephone headset, etc.
C: RUSTY
D: Two. And one of them is lonely.
N: DANCE MUSIC overwhelms the SOUNDTRACK...
S: INT. OLYMPIC GARDENS STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
N: ... as we join a lap dance already in progress. A security Technician (one of the two Frank eavesdropped on in the break room) shells out twenty bucks every three minutes for a DANCER to grind her pelvis against his chest... ... and while the Technician grins not-very-soberly and ogles her perfect breasts and paws at her midriff, the Dancer secretly removes the keycard from his belt.
C: DANCER
D: I'll be right back, honey. Don't move a muscle.
C: TECHNICIAN
D: Depends on the muscle.
E: drunk and in love
N: She pouts, flirtingly, as she does for every idiot who drops a line like that, then makes her way to...
S: EXT. OLYMPIC GARDENS STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
N: ... where Rusty waits for her, and when she slips him the keycard, he slips her a c-note.
C: RUSTY
D: Thanks, Charmaine. I'll have it back within the hour. Say hello to your mom for me.
E: as he goes
C: DANCER
D: Say it yourself. She'll be onstage in five minutes.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
N: FOLLOWING a bunch of balloons -- all congratulating "Happy Anniversary!" -- as a delivery boy carries them through the casino, and just as he's passing an "Employees Only" door (complete with sentry and embedded ceiling camera)... ... he bumps into a TOURIST, and the balloons drift out of his hand and into the camera...
C: TOURIST
D: Hey, watch it, bud...
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: As the balloons fill the frame of one monitor...
C: SLIM
D: 433, we have visual impairment on the east door camera.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT
N: The SENTRY (#433) hears this and spots the balloons covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery boy (who by freak accident happens to be Virgil Malloy)...
C: SENTRY
D: Excuse me, sir: You're going to have to move your balloons.
N: ... but Virgil's too busy picking a fight with the Tourist (surprise, surprise: Turk Malloy) to listen.
C: VIRGIL
D: Who you calling 'bud,' pal?
C: TURK
D: Who you calling 'pal,' friend?
E: TOURIST
C: VIRGIL
D: Who you calling 'friend'... ... bud...
E: can't think of another
N: And with the Sentry out of position... ... Livingston (dressed now in a technician's uniform, don't worry about how he got it) goes quickly to the door and swipes the newly-acquired keycard and when it flashes red-to-green, he enters... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 48.
S: INT. CAGE - HALLWAY
N: He's in. Livingston takes a moment, his brow perspiring (he's in the lions' den now), then checks his palm: drawn there in ballpoint is a diagram of the cage corridors.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY - ON MONITOR NEXT TO BALLOON-CLOUDED ONE
N: Livingston appears and, as nonchalantly as he can, he ambles down a hallway, then another, until he reaches...
S: INT. CAGE - HALLWAY
N: ... an unmarked door next to the entrance to the security center. Livingston swipes his keycard to enter...
S: INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM
N: A giant walk-in closet/switchboard full of wires, plugs, lights, etc. Livingston goes to work: FLURRY OF SHOTS He splices into all sorts of wires and lines and cables. Meanwhile...
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT
N: ... Virgil and Turk argue, nose-to-nose, "accidentally" blocking the Sentry from the balloons...
C: VIRGIL
D: You hear about this new medical discovery they made? It's called a 'sense of direction.' Apparently we're all supposed to have one...
C: TURK
D: Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, balloon boy.
C: SENTRY
D: Gentlemen, gentlemen...
S: INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM
N: Livingston's work here is almost done: he clips a small mechanism (known in his industry as a "spider" -- it's small, black, antenna-less and hides in dark places) to a main conduit, then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is picking up the spider's feed. One last click into place...
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: ... causes a brief, unnoticed blip on Slim's monitors...
S: INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: ... and transmits all the views of the cages onto the monitors upstairs. Danny and Rusty witness their appearance.
C: DANNY
D: Why do they paint hallways that color?
C: RUSTY
D: They say taupe is very soothing.
S: INT. CAGE - HALLWAY
N: Livingston steps outside. His job done, he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and... Whoops. His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. He's flying blind. He looks left down a corridor, then right, trying to remember which way he came from. No idea.
S: INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM
C: DANNY
D: Uh-oh.
S: INT. CAGE - HALLWAY
N: MOVING WITH Livingston as he tries to find his way out. He takes a left... Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead. Livingston has no recourse but to march right by him.
C: FAT
D: Hiya.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Fine, thanks.
N: Livingston continues on, and maybe for a second he thinks he's in the clear, especially when he sees the exit looming ahead, but then Fat turns behind him and hails him back...
C: FAT
D: Hey...
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT
N: At last, the Sentry outmaneuvers Virgil and Turk and grabs the balloons himself. Virgil quickly snatches them back...
C: VIRGIL
D: Hey... get your own balloons.
S: INT. CAGE - HALLWAY
N: Livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green.
C: FAT
D: Hey...
E: on his tail
N: Livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his keycard. He tries again. Red flashes to green. He pulls the door... ... but Fat blocks it. Livingston peers up, certain he's had it.
S: INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM
N: Danny and Rusty simultaneously lean forward.
S: INT. CAGE - HALLWAY
C: FAT
D: You dropped this.
N: Fat holds out Livingston's receiver and drops it in his hand. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 51.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Thanks.
N: And he's out.
S: INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S SUITE - NIGHT
N: Danny and Rusty exhale.
C: DANNY
D: Well...
C: RUSTY
D: Yeah...
C: DANNY
D: Fourth task: construction...
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools, paint, etc. -- and Yen hauls three times his share, carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus act in a hardware store.
C: DANNY
D: We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault.
E: V.O.
C: RUSTY
D: For practice.
E: V.O.
C: DANNY
D: Something like that.
E: V.O.
N: As Linus hauls in materials, Danny takes him aside.
C: DANNY
D: Fifth task: intelligence. We need those codes, Linus. From the only man who has all three.
C: LINUS
D: Benedict.
C: DANNY
D: Learn to love his shadow. Sixth task: transport...
E: back to the team
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 52.
C: LINUS
D: Wait, wait, wait. All I get to do is watch him?
E: young and eager
C: DANNY
D: For now. You gotta walk before you crawl.
C: RUSTY
D: Reverse that.
E: to Linus, correcting Danny
C: DANNY
D: Sixth task: transport...
E: toward the Malloys
S: EXT. BILLY TIM'S VAN AND TRUCK DEALERSHIP - OFFICE - DAY
N: Outside a window: Turk and Virgil jump up and down on opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability. Inside, Frank negotiates with BILLY TIM, a Cal- Worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays attention to him, half-frets over the Malloys outside.
C: BILLY TIM
D: I'm sorry: eighteen-five each is the best offer I can make you.
C: FRANK
D: Oh, I understand perfectly. They are beautiful vans. Well, I thank you for your time, Mister...?
E: playing a bit of a dandy
C: BILLY TIM
D: Denham. Billy Tim Denham.
C: FRANK
D: Yes, Denham, like a jean. You know: you have lovely hands -- do you moisturize?
E: they shake
C: BILLY TIM
D: I'm sorry?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 53. Frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now is to force Billy Tim into lowering his price just to get Frank out of his office.
C: FRANK
D: I swear by it. I try all sorts of lotions. I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in...
C: BILLY TIM
D: Uh-huh. You said you'd be willing to pay in cash?
E: just can't get his hand back
C: FRANK
D: I did. You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies...
C: BILLY TIM
D: If you could pay cash, I could probably drop the price a little. To, say, seventeen... ... sixteen each.
E: as Frank squeezes a little
C: FRANK
D: That would be lovely.
E: big smile
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - BACK TO DANNY - DAY
N: overseeing the construction, reviewing his list of tasks on his fingers, suspecting he's missed one.
C: DANNY
D: ... Power, surveillance, transport...
C: TISHKOFF
D: Anything I can do?
N: Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him, dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he missed.
C: DANNY
D: Get your wallet.
S: INT. HABERDASHERY
N: A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...
C: SAUL
D: This is nice material.
C: DANNY
D: It's Armani, Saul.
C: SAUL
D: It's very nice.
N: Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a moment."
C: DANNY
D: Saul, you sure you're ready to do this?
N: Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes icicles.
C: SAUL
D: If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won't wake up the following morning.
N: They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never waver.
C: DANNY
D: You're ready.
N: Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices...
C: SAUL
D: Hello. My name is Lyman Zerga... My name is Lyman Zerga...
E: this time a little deeper
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
N: Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could be Scottish, could be Israeli...
C: SAUL
D: My name is Lyman Zerga... My name is Lyman Zerga...
N: Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.
C: DANNY
D: There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last.
N: Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...
C: SAUL
D: You seen my...
C: DANNY
D: Bought you a fresh roll.
E: handing him Rolaids
N: The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for him.
C: VIRGIL
D: Mr. Zerga, we're here.
C: DANNY
D: Good luck, Lyman.
C: SAUL
D: Luck is for losers.
E: hesitates, then gets out
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY
N: Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and trailing him. He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE...
C: V.I.P. CONCIERGE
D: Good afternoon, sir. How can I be of service?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 56.
C: SAUL
D: My name is Lyman Zerga. I'd like a suite, please.
C: V.I.P. CONCIERGE
D: Do you have a reservation with us?
C: SAUL
D: I don't make reservations.
E: long glare at him
N: A longer glance at Lyman's bodyguards tells the Concierge this is not a man to be denied. As he jumps to it...
S: A93 INT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE - DAY A93
N: Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.
C: RUSTY
D: Okay. Tell me about Benedict.
C: LINUS
D: The guy is a machine.
S: EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)
N: TERRY BENEDICT emerges from a Town Car and, from his haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless perfection. He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye contact to no man. He strides into his casino and, appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in.
C: LINUS
D: He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m. Same Town Car, same driver. Remembers every valet's name on the way in. Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BELLAGIO - ELEVATOR BAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)
N: The doors open, and Terry Benedict steps out. Linus watches from a craps table.
C: LINUS
D: Offices are upstairs. He works hard, hits the lobby floor at seven on the nose.
E: V.O.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 57.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (SUPER SLOW MOTION)
N: From a balcony, Benedict stands overlooking the casino floor. His CASINO MANAGER approaches and they confer.
C: LINUS
D: Spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager.
E: V.O.
C: RUSTY
D: What do they talk about?
E: V.O.
C: LINUS
D: All business. Benedict likes to know what's going on in his casinos. There's rarely an incident he doesn't know about or handle personally.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM (SUPER SLOW MOTION)
N: Benedict works the room. He speaks to a Japanese High Roller in Japanese, to a Swiss in German, etc.
C: LINUS
D: He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers. He's fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he's taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. He's out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. Contents: the day's take and new security codes. Then he heads to the restaurant.
E: V.O.
N: Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands him a black portfolio.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - OUTSIDE RESTAURANT
N: Rusty and Linus watch the entrance: No one enters.
C: LINUS
D: Give him another ten seconds.
N: Around the corner comes Benedict, carrying his black portfolio.
C: LINUS
D: As I said: a machine.
C: RUSTY
D: And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 3/30/01 58.
C: LINUS
D: Two minutes after they've been changed, he's got 'em in hand. I'll tell you: you guys picked a helluva target. He is as smart and ruthless as they come. The last guy caught cheating here, Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize the guy's home and bankrupted --
E: beat
C: RUSTY
D: -- his brother-in-law's tractor dealership, I heard.
C: LINUS
D: He doesn't just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood. And everyone-you- ever-met's livelihood.
C: RUSTY
D: You scared?
C: LINUS
D: You suicidal?
C: RUSTY
D: Only in the morning. Now what?
E: beat
C: LINUS
D: Now comes the girl... if she comes in after he does, that means they're in a snit.
C: RUSTY
D: Where's she come from?
C: LINUS
D: The museum downstairs. She's the curator there. Wait... here she is. You'll like this.
N: Rusty looks up as... ... a beautiful woman (the one Danny saw on Benedict's arm in the New York Times photo) appears. Elegantly dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own private space. And Rusty's face just about drops at the sight of her. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 3/30/01 58A.
C: LINUS
D: I don't know if we can use her yet. I haven't even caught her name.
C: RUSTY
D: Tess.
C: LINUS
D: What?
C: RUSTY
D: Her name is Tess.
E: looks very certain about this, very certain and very upset
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 59.
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Construction continues into the wee hours.
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape. Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then matches its image (of Frank staple-gunning floorboard into place) to a security tape of the real McCoy. On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and blow torches. Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil handles.
C: TISHKOFF
D: This looks familiar. Where'd you get this?
C: VIRGIL
D: Off your Rolls.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Danny! Tell 'em not to touch the Rolls!
N: Overlooking the whole enterprise is Danny, grinning from ear to ear, happy in his work. He checks a stopwatch in his hand as... ... the false top to the cash cart before him flies open, revealing Yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded into a three-by-four foot space. He whips an air hose from his mouth and inhales deeply. Danny checks his watch.
C: DANNY
D: 29:47. Everything okay in there?
N: Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn't understand him. But Rusty does, appearing behind him.
C: RUSTY
D: But what doesn't beat the shit out of being a circus performer?
N: Danny turns to Rusty: he looks very, very serious.
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Danny and Rusty adjourn from the warehouse.
C: DANNY
D: What is it?
C: RUSTY
D: Tell me this isn't about her. Or I'll walk off the job right now. Tess. She's with Terry Benedict now. Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife.
E: off Danny's reaction
C: DANNY
D: Ex-wife.
C: RUSTY
D: Tell me.
C: DANNY
D: It's not. About that. Entirely.
N: A beat.
C: DANNY
D: You said you needed a reason. Well, this is mine. When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren't gonna hurt anybody. We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That's why I'm here.
E: beat
N: A beat.
C: RUSTY
D: Here's the problem: we're stealing two things now. And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose? And remember: Tess doesn't divide eleven ways.
N: A beat.
C: DANNY
D: If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice.
N: The two men stand quietly for a moment.
C: DANNY
D: How'd she look by the way? Tess...
C: RUSTY
D: I've seen her happier.
N: CLOSE ON PICASSO'S WOMAN WITH GUITAR
C: TESS
D: 'Radiant' is the word. Absolutely radiant.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BELLAGIO ART GALLERY - DAY
N: The painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall between a van Gogh and a Monet. At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the seller's AIDE-DE-CAMP. A staff photographer and other personnel mill nearby. Off to the side, in a sharp blazer, Tess stands transfixed by the painting.
C: TESS
D: He painted it in the summer of 1912, after the break-up with Fernande Olivier.
C: SELLER
D: She must have put him through hell.
C: TESS
D: You can see the conflict. He makes her both erotic and grotesque. He's hopelessly drawn to her, and yet she drives him crazy.
C: AIDE-DE-CAMP
D: Mr. Santaniello has an early flight. Do you think Mr. Benedict will be late?
E: checking his watch
C: TESS
D: Mr. Benedict is never late.
N: Just then the double doors to the gallery swing open, and Terry Benedict enters, right on time. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 62. He is elegant, beaming, commanding. All that's missing is a blare of trumpets.
C: BENEDICT
D: Am I late?
C: TESS
D: Not at all, Mr. Benedict. Allow me to introduce to you Mr. Jean Santaniello.
E: greeting him
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Santaniello, I apologize if I kept you. I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter. I gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.
E: to Seller
C: SELLER
D: I understand it's going to be a hell of a fight.
C: BENEDICT
D: We hope.
N: Tess angles Benedict toward the painting.
C: TESS
D: Here it is.
N: Benedict moves toward the painting, and as he does he catches Tess in his glance, and his smile deepens. Then:
C: BENEDICT
D: Magnificent! I've been following her for fifteen years now. At last I've made her a home. All the arrangements and so forth...
E: to Tess
C: SELLER
D: Done. She's yours.
C: BENEDICT
D: Not mine. She belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel. Isn't that right, Ms. Ocean?
C: TESS
D: Yes, Mr. Benedict.
C: BENEDICT
D: She's lovely, isn't she? I can't be the only one who was after her.
E: as the Seller is confused; Benedict specifies painting
C: SELLER
D: You're the only one who met my price.
C: BENEDICT
D: Ah, but this... You can't put a price on beauty. But I shouldn't philosophize. I own casinos, after all.
C: AIDE-DE-CAMP
D: Can we get a quick shot? Mr. Santaniello has a plane to catch.
C: BENEDICT
D: Of course, of course.
N: Tess understands: she is not to be part of the photo. Benedict and the Seller pose together and... Flash!
S: INT. BELLAGIO ART GALLERY - LATER
N: The Seller exits with the Aide-De-Camp in tow. Benedict remains, enthralled by the painting. Tess appears beside him.
C: TESS
D: You like it?
C: BENEDICT
D: I like that you like it. I have some bad news from the world of high fashion. It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night. Red trunks with a white stripe.
E: beat
C: TESS
D: Oh?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 64.
C: BENEDICT
D: And you, as I recall, will be wearing a red Donna Karan? And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row, that red dress...
C: TESS
D: I see.
C: BENEDICT
D: He's a charming man, but no one's going to be watching him when they can make a study of you. I've asked Paolo to find three or four things for you to try. I hope you're not too disappointed.
N: She is, but she buries it.
C: BENEDICT
D: Are you sure?
N: She nods, smiles faintly.
C: BENEDICT
D: I'll see you tonight.
N: Instinctively she leans in to kiss him. He recoils ever so slightly.
C: TESS
D: What? We're alone.
N: He lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling, over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there. She follows his look.
C: BENEDICT
D: In my hotels, there's always someone watching.
N: But he kisses her anyway.
C: TESS
D: I'll see you tonight.
N: He glances once more on the Picasso as he moves away.
C: BENEDICT
D: Actually, I do like it.

N: Quiet, elegant, tense. One table is operating only, in the corner, and at it Saul, as Lyman Zerga, furtively peels at the roll of Rolaids and slips one in his mouth. HIGH ROLLER #1 Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?
C: SAUL
D: I don't believe in weakness. It costs too much. I don't believe in questions, either.
N: This shuts the High Roller up fast. Saul looks up from the table, just perceptibly, to spot Terry Benedict, on his way in, right on schedule. He approaches the PIT BOSS by the entrance.
C: BENEDICT
D: Eddie. Anything for me?
C: PIT BOSS
D: Mr. Zerga, sir. Lyman Zerga. In the third position. Wishes to speak with you privately.
C: BENEDICT
D: Who is he?
C: PIT BOSS
D: Businessman of some kind, working mostly in Europe. He's very vague, but I asked around. Word is he deals primarily in arms. One of the biggest.
C: BENEDICT
D: Zerga? Never heard of him.
C: PIT BOSS
D: Yessir. That's why I don't doubt it.
C: BENEDICT
D: He's staying here?
C: PIT BOSS
D: Checked in two nights ago, sir. He's in the Mirador suite.
C: BENEDICT
D: How's he doing?
C: PIT BOSS
D: Up. Almost forty grand.
C: BENEDICT
D: Good for him...
E: knowing he can't duck this
S: INT. BELLAGIO - RESTAURANT - SAME TIME
N: Tess Ocean sits in a booth and sips at a glass of wine and checks her watch: Benedict is late or very close to being so... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 67. ... when a pair of hands slips over her shoulders and starts to caress her arms.
C: TESS
D: You're thirty seconds late. I was about to send out a search party... Danny...
E: without looking at him recognizing the hands, she turns, stunned
C: DANNY
D: Hello, Tess.
E: standing over her, grinning
C: TESS
D: What are you doing here?
E: thrilled and petrified and stunned to see him, but outraged mostly
C: DANNY
D: I'm out.
C: TESS
D: You're out.
C: DANNY
D: Of prison. You remember. The day I went for cigarettes and never came back. You must have noticed.
C: TESS
D: I don't smoke. Don't sit --
E: as he sits
C: DANNY
D: They said I'd paid my debt to society.
E: but he does
C: TESS
D: Funny, I never got a check.
N: Danny smiles. Tess stares daggers.
C: TESS DANNY
D: You can't stay. It's good to see you.
C: DANNY
D: You're not wearing your ring.
N: A beat.
C: TESS
D: I sold it. And I don't have a husband. Or didn't you get the papers?
C: DANNY
D: My last day inside.
C: TESS
D: I told you I'd write.
N: Danny reaches his hand (ringed) for hers (ringless), but she removes it from the table.
C: TESS
D: Danny. Go. Now. Before...
C: DANNY
D: Benedict?
N: She freezes: Danny knows. He smiles: it's okay. Then, to a passing waiter:
C: DANNY
D: Whiskey and -- -- whiskey.
E: his fingers two inches apart then one inch apart
C: TESS
D: Danny...
C: DANNY
D: You're doing a great job curating the museum.
N: She sighs, exasperated.
C: DANNY
D: The Vermeer is quite good. Simple but vibrant. Although his work definitely fell off as he got older.
C: TESS
D: Remind you of anyone?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 69.
C: DANNY
D: And I still get Monet and Manet confused. Which one married his mistress?
C: TESS
D: Monet.
C: DANNY
D: Right. Manet had syphilis.
C: TESS
D: They also painted occasionally.
N: A beat.
C: DANNY
D: You don't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years.
C: TESS
D: Did it always go this poorly?
C: DANNY
D: Yes.
C: TESS
D: Sounds frustrating.
C: DANNY
D: You were never easy. Okay. I'll make this quick. I came here for you. I'm gonna get on with my life, and I want you with me.
E: as she shrugs
C: TESS
D: You're a thief and a liar.
C: DANNY
D: I only lied about being a thief. But I don't do that anymore.
C: TESS
D: Steal?
C: DANNY
D: Lie.
C: TESS
D: I'm with someone now who doesn't have to make that kind of distinction.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 03/20/01 70.
C: DANNY
D: No, he's very clear on both.
C: TESS
D: Nice. Work on that for two years, too?
C: DANNY
D: Year and a half.
N: A light smile from Tess.
C: TESS
D: Do you know what your problem is?
C: DANNY
D: I only have one?
C: TESS
D: You've met too many people like you. I'm with Terry now.
E: then
C: DANNY
D: Does he make you laugh?
C: TESS
D: He doesn't make me cry.
S: INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM - SAME TIME
N: At the table, Saul bets heavily for the bank. Benedict approaches, stands off to the right, watching.
C: HIGH ROLLER
D: You don't want to get in the hole too heavy to this Benedict. A friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g's from the guy. Two months went by, Benedict hadn't heard from him, he calls my friend up, asks 'Where's my money?' I'll get to it when I get to it,' my friend says. Half hour later Benedict's in my friend's hotel room, dangling him off his 10th floor balcony by his feet. 'You gonna get to it now?'
E: to Saul, noticing his heavy bet
N: High Roller turns over a nine. Saul wins. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 03/20/01 70A. CONTINUED: (A1)
C: FRANK
D: Bank wins -- natural nine.
N: Benedict steps forward.
C: HIGH ROLLER
D: Hiya, Terry.
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Weintraub. How's everything?
C: HIGH ROLLER
D: Eh. They put too much grenadine in my Shirley Temple.
C: BENEDICT
D: And here I thought you were drinking vodka. Mr. Zerga.
E: turning attention to Saul
C: SAUL
D: Mr. Benedict. I recognize you from the TV. You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want. I respect your waiting.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/01 71.
C: BENEDICT
D: You're the guest, sir.
C: SAUL
D: And I have to impose on your hospitality. Can you sit in for a hand?
C: BENEDICT
D: I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers.
C: SAUL
D: That's a shame. You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley.
C: BENEDICT
D: No shame at all. Reminds me of my youth.
N: CORNER - MOMENT LATER Benedict and Saul are huddled in a corner.
C: SAUL
D: The fight is Saturday, is it not?
C: BENEDICT
D: Yes. I can get you seats...
C: SAUL
D: No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.
C: BENEDICT
D: I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you.
C: SAUL
D: The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. I'm afraid I need something more secure.
C: BENEDICT
D: I can assure you, the house safe is utterly...
C: SAUL
D: I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. Now: what can you offer me besides the safe?
E: his looks stops Benedict
N: Saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar with being denied. And Benedict recognizes that fact.
S: INT. BELLAGIO - RESTAURANT - SAME TIME
C: TESS
D: See, the kind of people you steal things from, they have insurance to compensate them. They get made whole again. I had to leave New York to get away from what happened. How do I get my five years back, Danny?
C: DANNY
D: You can't. But what you can do is not throw away another five years.
C: TESS
D: You don't know anything about --
C: DANNY
D: Listen, you don't love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else? Fine, I'll have to live with that. But not him.
E: leaning in
C: TESS
D: Spoken like a true ex-husband.
C: DANNY
D: I'm not joking, Tess.
C: TESS
D: I'm not laughing. You have to admit there's a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life.
E: beat
N: Danny exhales and leans back. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 73.
C: DANNY
D: Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
N: She looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he isn't. She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful. He sees her looking at it.
C: TESS
D: Do you remember what I said to you when we first met?
C: DANNY
D: You said: you better know what you're doing.
C: TESS
D: Do you? Now? Because -- truly -- you should walk out the door if you don't.
C: DANNY
D: I know what I'm doing.
C: BENEDICT
D: What are you doing?
N: Terry Benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his meeting with Saul.
C: DANNY
D: Catching up.
C: TESS
D: Terry, meet my ex-husband...
C: DANNY
D: Danny Ocean.
E: extending his hand
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Ocean. Forgive me for being late. A guest required my attention.
E: taking it to Tess
C: TESS
D: Danny was just walking through the restaurant and spotted me.
C: BENEDICT
D: Is that right?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 74.
C: DANNY
D: I was shocked myself. Imagine the odds.
C: BENEDICT
D: 'Of all the gin joints in all the world...' You've been in prison until recently, isn't that right? How does it feel to be out?
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: About the same. Everything you want is still on the other side.
C: BENEDICT
D: There's the human condition for you.
C: TESS
D: Terry, Danny was just about to...
C: DANNY
D: I just wanted to say hello. For old time's sake.
C: BENEDICT
D: Stay for a drink, if you like.
C: TESS
D: He can't --
C: DANNY
D: -- I can't.
E: simultaneously
N: An awkward silence. Benedict takes Tess's hand in his.
C: BENEDICT
D: Well, then I don't imagine we'll be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean.
C: DANNY
D: You never know.
C: BENEDICT
D: I know everything that happens in my hotels.
C: DANNY
D: So I should put those towels back.
C: BENEDICT
D: The towels you can keep.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 75.
C: DANNY
D: Good seeing you, Tess.
E: smiles, rises
C: TESS
D: Take care, Danny.
N: Danny goes. When he's out the door...
C: TESS
D: I'm sorry --
C: BENEDICT
D: Don't be.
E: like lightning
N: OUTSIDE RESTAURANT MOVING WITH Danny as he exits, his fingers snapping, he saw the mist in Tess's eyes just now, he knows he's got a fighting chance with her, but what he does not know is... ... Linus is tailing him, ten steps back. He stops, glances back at the restaurant quizzically, then continues following Danny.
S: INT. BASHER TARR'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg. Basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles, whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an emerald shape. There's a KNOCK at the door...
C: MAID
D: House cleaning.
E: O.S.
C: BASHER
D: Just jumping into the shower, can you come back later?
E: eyes never leave his work
N: The maid moves on, on TV: A Reporter broadcasts live...
C: REPORTER
D: We're here at the historic Paradiso Hotel and Casino, once the prize resort of Las Vegas, now seconds away from demolition...
E: V.O.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 76.
S: EXT. PARADISO HOTEL (ON STRIP) - DAY
N: Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino. A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.
C: REPORTER
D: ... and here's Reuben Tishkoff, former owner of the Paradiso, come to bid farewell to his fabled resort and wish Terry Benedict all the best with his future plans for the property...
N: Terry greets Reuben before the TV cameras and newspaper reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but behind those smiles and under their breaths...
C: BENEDICT
D: Good to see you.
C: REUBEN
D: Go shit in your mouth.
N: Tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring back at her: Danny's. She holds his glance a moment -- long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice -- before turning away, to... ... Benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and Benedict leans into a microphone...
C: BENEDICT
D: I hope there's as much dynamite in the Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday's fight.
N: ... and -- WHOOMPH -- the PLUNGER comes down and -- write your own onomatopoeia here -- the PARADISO IMPLODES. Reuben wipes a tear from his eye.
C: REUBEN
D: G'bye, honey...
S: INT. BASHER TARR'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
N: As the Paradiso crumbles outside his window, the lights and TV in his room flicker and go out.
C: BASHER
D: Shit.
N: As he scrambles out the door, making sure to post a "Do Not Disturb" sign...
C: RUSTY
D: Saturday day is yours. Do whatever you like with it.
E: V.O.
S: INT. TISHKOFF'S - GAME ROOM - NIGHT
N: FROM ABOVE, SLOWLY DESCENDING: Ten of our eleven (Basher is missing) surround the model of the three casinos. Rusty leads everyone in a run-down of the heist...
C: RUSTY
D: Call is at five-thirty. Makeup and costume. Saul's package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. All goes well there and we're a go. Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we're committed. From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates.
N: We DESCEND ONTO the miniature of the vault, then --
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT
N: FROM ABOVE, DESCENDING STILL: This is the Real Deal. The Bellagio vault. A clock reads: 8:03.
C: RUSTY
D: Once the electricity goes, all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes. That's when we make our move...
E: V.O.
N: Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vault's center and march out again, closing the thick metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK... ... We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart. There is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then... ... the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen within, folded neatly. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 78. He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. He takes in the room: vacant and silent. Except for Rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously.
C: RUSTY
D: Okay: they've put you in the middle of the room, far from everything. You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor. What do you do?
N: A WIDER ANGLE reveals we're...
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and what we've been watching has been a trial run. Ten of the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew watching a dress rehearsal.
C: FRANK
D: Fin says he shorts it.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Make it a sawbuck.
N: From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with both hands without touching the floor. From this position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door... Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.
C: BASHER
D: We're in deep shit.
E: and he's not happy
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if nobody understands a word he's saying, that's okay... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 79.
C: BASHER
D: The damn demo crew didn't use a coaxial lynch to back the mainline! Onioned the mainframe couplet!
N: Reuben leans into Livingston...
C: REUBEN
D: You understand any of this?
C: LIVINGSTON
D: I'll explain later.
C: BASHER
D: Blew the backup grid one by one! Like dominoes!
C: DANNY
D: Basher. What happened?
E: as he hardly understands this either
S: FLASHBACK - INT. VEGAS SEWERS - THAT AFTERNOON
N: A cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse boxes, and Basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of effluent.
C: BASHER
D: They did exactly what I planned to do. Only they did it by accident. Now they know their weakness. And they're fixing it.
E: V.O.
N: An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.
S: INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: Basher towels off his hair...
C: DANNY
D: So...
C: BASHER
D: So unless we decide to do this job in Reno, we're screwed.
N: Danny rises and paces, frustrated. He's come too far for things to go awry now. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 80.
C: RUSTY
D: We could --
C: DANNY
D: By tomorrow?
N: Danny keeps pacing; Rusty hangs his head and thinks; Basher dries his hair.
C: BASHER
D: We could use a pinch.
E: an idea occurs to him
N: Danny stops; Rusty looks up.
C: DANNY
D: What -- is a pinch?
S: INT. LAB - DAY
N: Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.
C: BASHER
D: A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry. Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb. Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity. That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death. So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.
E: V.O.
S: A121 INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT A121
C: RUSTY
D: For how long?
C: BASHER
D: About ten seconds.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 81. A121 CONTINUED: A121
C: DANNY
D: Could a pinch take out the power of an entire city? Like, I don't...
C: BASHER
D: Las Vegas? But there's only one pinch in the world big enough to handle it.
E: beat
N: Danny and Rusty trade a look: They have their answer.
C: DANNY
D: Where?
C: BASHER
D: Pasadena.
E: a beat, then balefully
S: B121 EXT. CAL TECH CAMPUS - NIGHT B121
N: Headlights hit a sign: "Cal Tech. HIGH-SECURITY AREA. KEEP OUT." A white VAN SHOOTS PAST it.
S: INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT
N: Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.
C: DANNY
D: You two ready?
E: to Basher and Yen
N: They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door. Linus starts to follow but...

D: Coming with you.

N: They can be heard WRESTLING. Linus has had enough. He sneaks out the van's back door without the Malloys hearing him. AT PERIMETER DOOR Linus sulks along the laboratory's perimeter, finds the door Danny pick-locked, and disappears inside. A moment passes. A moment passes. And the next door opens, and Danny, Basher, and Yen appear, pinch in hand -- they've succeeded. They weave a path to the van...
S: INT. VAN
N: Turk and Virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears. Danny, Basher and Yen pile in the back...
C: DANNY
D: We got it. Let's go.

N: Turk brakes, and they're not.
C: DANNY
D: Where's Linus?
N: Everyone realizes: he's not here. Just then: SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life. Uh-oh. Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by his side. His eyes scan the compound, then:
C: DANNY
D: There he is.
N: DANNY'S POV of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell. Linus scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasing guards. As he ascends out of sight... Danny shifts his focus to - DANNY'S POV The other side of the building, and two more guards arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase: Linus will be trapped. BACK TO SCENE Danny, Basher, and Yen squat side-by-side-by-side, watching all this. Yen makes a colorful observation about Linus's predicament; of course, no one understands it.
C: VIRGIL
D: One of us should help him.
E: O.S.
C: BASHER
D: Then there'll be two of us who need saving.
E: who speaks Danny's mind
C: DANNY
D: He knows where we are.

N: BACK TO SCENE Danny and Basher slowly turn: Turk and Virgil crouch inches behind them, wanting to spectate as well.

E: appearing from the rear doors
N: Linus scrambles back over the van, and Danny and Yen pull him in. Virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway, but he does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them slams shut right on Yen's hand -- CRUNCH!
C: YEN
D: Ahhh!
S: INT. WHITE VAN
N: as it hurtles away. Basher tends to Yen, cradling his hand, and Danny stares down Linus, breathless.

D: Where are they? That's what I want to know. Where are they?
C: SAUL
D: They'll be here.
E: as Lyman
C: TISHKOFF
D: 'They'll be here.' Thanks a lot, Fidel.
E: to himself, mocking "Lyman"
N: AT LIVINGSTON'S CONSOLE Punching up a new set of views from the Eye In The Sky, Livingston thrusts forward, alarmed by one.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Yikes.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - LOBBY - DAY
N: Rusty keeps watch on the hotel's side entrance. He glances at his watch, then outside again as the white van arrives, dropping off only Linus and Danny, who slaps the van's roof before it pulls away. As Danny and Linus enter the lobby, Rusty falls into step with them, exchanging a smile with Danny but not Linus, he still looks chastised from the car-trailer.
S: INT. ELEVATOR
N: Riding up...
C: RUSTY
D: You boys have a nice trip?
N: Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny. Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: We have a problem.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - ON LIVINGSTON'S LAPTOP - DAY
N: A mug-shot of Danny, complete with vital information: height, weight, criminal history.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: You've been red-flagged. It means the moment you step on the casino floor, they'll be watching you. Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.
C: DANNY
D: This is a problem.
N: A pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem, this is disastrous. Only SAUL dares make a noise, HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room.
C: RUSTY
D: Saul: time to get out.
C: SAUL
D: It's time when I say it is.
E: O.S. as Lyman
C: RUSTY
D: Now!
N: We hear HIM JUMP-TO-IT out of the tub... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 90.
C: SAUL
D: I'm out.
E: O.S. himself again
C: RUSTY
D: You have any idea how this happened?
E: back to Danny
N: Before Danny can answer...
C: LINUS
D: I do. He's been chasing Benedict's woman. Got into a real snarl with him two nights ago. I was tailing you.
E: off Danny's look
C: DANNY
D: Who told you to do that?
N: Before Linus can answer...
C: RUSTY
D: I did. I knew you couldn't leave Tess alone.
E: he and Danny hold a stare
C: TISHKOFF
D: Who's Tess?
C: DANNY
D: My wife.
C: RUSTY
D: Ex-wife.
C: SAUL
D: Tess is here?
E: appearing in a bathrobe
C: RUSTY
D: I'm sorry. I didn't know if it would sting you, but it did. You're out, Danny.
E: eyes still on Danny the most difficult words he's ever had to say
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 91.
C: TISHKOFF
D: He's out?!
C: RUSTY
D: It's that or we shut down right now. His involvement puts us all at risk.
N: Danny and Rusty face off, furious with each other.
C: DANNY
D: This isn't your call.
C: RUSTY
D: You made it my call. When you put her ahead of us. You made it mine.
C: DANNY
D: This is my job.
C: RUSTY
D: Not anymore.
N: Danny stares daggers at Rusty. But he can see: everyone in the room is on Rusty's side. Defeated, he stalks out of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down Linus.
C: TISHKOFF
D: But, but... he can't just be out. Who's gonna take his place?
N: Rusty turns to Linus.
C: RUSTY
D: Kid, you up for it?
N: Linus's eyes drift to Danny outside -- whatever acrimony he felt before, he never meant to kick Danny off the job. He nods, half-cocksure/half-scared-pissless: he's up for it.
C: RUSTY
D: Find everyone else. Let 'em know the change in plan. Curtain goes up at seven.
E: to Livingston
N: Livingston exits. Everyone else in the room staggers about, like witnesses after an execution. Rusty steps out onto the balcony, perhaps to console Danny, but (as Linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be heard. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 92.
C: SAUL
D: Tess is with Benedict now? She's too tall for him.
E: as nobody responds
S: INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Tess, readying herself for the big evening, meets her own glance in a dressing mirror, then spots Benedict in its reflection, pacing the bedroom behind her.
C: BENEDICT
D: Yes. Yes. No. Very much no. Then inform Mr. Levin he'll find a better view of the fight in front of his television. Surely he must have H.B.O.
E: on phone beat
N: Hanging up, Benedict approaches her, puts his hands on her shoulders...
C: BENEDICT
D: What are you thinking about?
C: TESS
D: You.
N: She smiles at him in the mirror. His glance in it, turns from her to himself.
S: INT. EXECUTIVE ELEVATOR
N: Riding down, Terry Benedict checks his watch. The elevator doors open and...
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - ELEVATOR BAY
N: ... he steps onto his casino's floor, the king of Las Vegas. The time is 7:00. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 93. ON BALCONY OVERLOOKING CASINO FLOOR Benedict meets his casino Manager, according to schedule.
C: BENEDICT
D: Any sign of Ocean?
C: MANAGER
D: Not in a couple hours. You want him out? I can bounce him from the state for parole violation if you like.
E: WALSH
C: BENEDICT
D: Put a guy on him. He's here for a reason. I'd like to know what it is. But if he comes anywhere near Tess, take it to the next level.
E: shakes his head
C: MANAGER
D: Bruiser?
N: Benedict nods, goes on his way. AT CASINO ENTRANCE Saul, as Lyman Zerga, stands ramrod straight, looking through sliding glass doors out at the valet station. From behind, Terry Benedict approaches, two security guards walking half a pace behind him. Saul spots him in the glass's reflection; he does not turn.
C: SAUL
D: Mr. Benedict.
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Zerga. It's a very busy night for me. Are we on schedule?
C: SAUL
D: I have no reason to suspect otherwise. My couriers should be here momentarily.
N: A beat as Benedict studies Saul.
C: BENEDICT
D: It's a nice evening. Shall we wait outside?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 94. POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - ON BELLAGIO VALET AREA Benedict and Saul emerge, guards positioned around them.
C: TURK
D: They're in position.
E: V.O.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Okay. We're a go.
E: V.O. over STATIC
S: EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - VALET AREA - SUNSET
N: A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait. Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard suits.
C: TURK
D: Mr. Zerga. A gift from Mr. Hesse.
N: Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the cuff on Turk's wrist, transfers it to Saul's, clamps it shut, and hands Saul the key.
C: SAUL
D: Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther.
N: He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO
N: Frank deals blackjack to a full table. His eyes gaze past his players to Saul, the guards and Benedict passing by.
C: FRANK
D: Lookin' like a bad night for the house.
E: as he busts
N: MOVING WITH Benedict as he spies out of the corner of his eye Danny, lurking at a slot machine. To one of his guards...
C: BENEDICT
D: Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean's in the west slots.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 95. The guard goes, and Benedict continues with Saul...
C: BENEDICT
D: I'm afraid I can't allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages. I hope you don't mind...
C: SAUL
D: Of course not.
N: Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when... ... passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an old RACETRACK DENIZEN happens past this cabal and, worse yet, happens to recognize Saul.
C: RACETRACK DENIZEN
D: Saul? Saul Bloom, is that you?
N: Saul does his best to ignore the man. But even Benedict notices: this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga.
C: RACETRACK DENIZEN
D: Saul, it's me. Bucky Buchanan, remember? From Saratoga.
N: At last Saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes.
C: SAUL
D: Friedrich, Gunther.
N: An order: dispose of this man. Virgil and Turk pick up the Denizen by his elbows and haul him away.
C: SAUL
D: Mr. Benedict... Please: I have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin.
E: gesturing to the cage; re: his briefcase-cuff
N: They proceed. AT SLOTS Danny sits in a row of octogenarians, all vacantly dropping $1 coins and pulling levers. As he watches Saul and Benedict disappear into the cage... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 96. DING! DING! DING! DING! Four cherries. Danny smiles, a big winner, but he's got bigger pots to win tonight. He steers a neighboring senior citizen (blind as a bat) to his slot machine...
C: DANNY
D: Pops, you won.
N: ... then slips away.
S: A153 INT. MIRADOR SUITE A153
N: Linus stands dressed in a sharp, conservative suit -- a far cry from the threadbare thief in Chicago. Rusty circles him, inspecting.
C: RUSTY
D: Where you gonna put your hands?
N: Linus clasps them.
C: RUSTY
D: No...
N: Linus goes for his pockets.
C: RUSTY
D: Not the pockets, either. And don't touch your tie. Look at me...
N: Linus does.
C: RUSTY
D: That how you gonna stand?
N: Linus shifts his balance.
C: RUSTY
D: Wrong again. I ask you a question, you have to think of the answer, where you gonna look?
N: Linus looks down.
C: RUSTY
D: Death. You look down, they know you're lying --
N: Linus looks up. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 97. A153 CONTINUED: A153
C: RUSTY
D: -- and up they know you don't know the truth. Don't use three words when one will do, don't shift your eyes, look always at your mark but don't stare, be specific but not memorable, funny but don't make him laugh, he's gotta like you then forget you the moment you've left his sight, and for God's sakes whatever you do, don't under any circumstances --
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Rust, can you come here a sec?
E: O.S.
C: RUSTY
D: Sure thing.
E: wandering off
N: Linus is left utterly bewildered, a thousand commandments to remember and fifteen minutes to remember them in.
S: EXT. ALLEY - DUSK
N: Turk and Virgil's white van whips around a corner and shoots inside...
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - SECOND VAN POV
N: Of which, importantly, we never see the exterior, just an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror... The white VAN SCREECHES to a halt inches from Basher who stands ready beside the pinch (and the now-gutted and dismantled mockup of the Bellagio vault) and faster than a NASCAR pit crew Basher, Turk and Virgil load the pinch into the white van's rear and before you can say "electromagnetic pulse" the VAN SCREECHES back out of the warehouse fully loaded. The time is 7:16.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CAGES - EMPTY COUNT ROOM
N: The room is empty save for a large table. Saul places his briefcase on it, adjusts its numbered combination locks, and opens it. Inside the case: five rows of glittering emeralds. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 98.
C: BENEDICT
D: They're very beautiful. A gift.
N: Saul stares at him: none of your fucking business.
C: BENEDICT
D: Can you lift them out, please?
N: Saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and Benedict pats down the case's interior. Saul replaces the tray.
C: BENEDICT
D: Alright, Mr. Zerga. I acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material. I further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in our secured vault. While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault...
C: SAUL
D: Why not?
C: BENEDICT
D: Insurance, for one. Security, another. And I don't trust you.
N: There is a KNOCK at the door, and Walsh the casino manager enters. He speaks low in Benedict's ear.
C: WALSH
D: I put two plainclothes on Ocean. He's at the keno bar now.
E: MANAGER
N: Walsh nods, and Benedict turns back to Saul.
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my casino manager. If you will allow, he will arrange for your briefcase to be stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor. Those are my terms. Yes or no?
E: beat
N: Saul and Benedict eyeball each other.
C: SAUL
D: You leave me no choice.
N: Saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 98A.
S: EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - KITCHEN ENTRANCE - NIGHT
N: The white van slows enough to unload Virgil and Turk, changed into waiter uniforms, and they hurry a table- clothed room service cart inside as Basher pulls away.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT
N: RISING FROM a spotless pair of wingtips shifting side-to- side, OVER hands flexing and stretching, UP TO Linus Caldwell. He keeps an eye on the cage door, waiting for Benedict to appear, as he tries anything to shake out his nerves. Then, from a discreet earpiece he wears, comes:
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Deep breaths. You'll do fine.
E: V.O.
C: LINUS
D: Thanks.
E: breathes deep
C: LIVINGSTON
D: No sweat, kid. You're a rock. Now don't fuck up.
E: V.O. as Linus smiles, feeling good about himself
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - ON LIVINGSTON'S MONITOR - NIGHT
N: Linus's smile disappears as he continues to bounce. There's a KNOCK at the door.
C: VOICE
D: Room service.
E: O.S.
N: Rusty checks through the peephole, then ushers in Turk and Virgil in costume with their room service cart.
C: TURK
D: Who ordered the penne?
N: Livingston raises a hand, and as Turk serves him his plate, Virgil whips off the cart's tablecloth: underneath it's the false-lid cash cart. Rusty turns to a corner.
C: RUSTY
D: You ready?
N: In it, Yen finishes bandaging his busted hand and nods.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - THE EYE IN THE SKY
N: Fat and Slim sit before their monitors, feet kicked up, as behind them Walsh, Benedict, and Saul enter.
C: WALSH
D: This is our security center, where we oversee all gaming in the casino as well as our vault. You'll be able to monitor your briefcase from here.
N: Walsh, finding Fat and Slim as they are, coughs; the two watchers leap immediately to their feet. Benedict checks his watch.
C: SAUL
D: Don't let me keep you.
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Zerga...
N: And Benedict takes his leave...
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
C: RUSTY
D: Linus... you're up.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT
N: Linus nods, shakes out his hands some more... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 100.
C: LINUS
D: Deep breaths, deep breaths.
N: ... and here comes Benedict, exiting the cage just as his assistant arrives with his portfolio. As he turns toward the restaurant...
C: LINUS
D: Mr. Benedict...
C: BENEDICT
D: Yes?
C: LINUS
D: Sheldon Wills. Nevada Gaming Commission. Could I have two minutes of your time?
E: presents proper identification
N: Benedict sighs -- his evening's been sidetracked enough already -- but...
C: BENEDICT
D: Of course. Anything for the N.G.C.
N: AT KENO BAR Danny watches Benedict escort Linus toward the blackjack tables, unaware that TWO PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GOONS watch him from across the bar, and when he turns in their direction, they look away, acting incognito, but it's not them he's turning toward... ... it's Tess, rounding a corner toward the restaurant. Danny jumps to his feet, throws a tip on the bar, and goes.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: The time is 7:27. Yen tucks himself into the cash cart's hidden compartment with a slim oxygen tank for company. Meanwhile, Rusty drills Virgil and Turk...
C: RUSTY
D: Okay: when do you make the deposit?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 101.
C: TURK
D: Not until we get your signal.
C: VIRGIL
D: Hey. What do we look like: a couple of peckerwood jackasses or something?
N: No one responds.
C: RUSTY
D: Amazing: how's it feel? You alright? Want something to read? Magazine?
E: turning his attention to Yen, squeezed into the cart as Yen nods
N: From the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to show Rusty what he can do with a magazine.
C: RUSTY
D: Okay. I'm counting down. Thirty minutes of breathing time starts... now.
N: On "now" a RUNNING CLOCK APPEARS ON-SCREEN, descending from 29:59. It will REMAIN there for the duration of the pre-pinch heist, jumping at times BETWEEN SCENES. Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug: it's shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the way to the door.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: You get no tip.
S: INT. CASINO FLOOR - 28:37
N: and counting. MOVING WITH Benedict and Linus into the Pit Boss's station.
C: LINUS
D: It only came to our attention this morning, Mr. Benedict. Apparently he has a record longer than my arm.
C: BENEDICT
D: If he is who you say he is. Charlie. Call over Ramon Escalante.
E: hailing a PIT BOSS
C: PIT BOSS
D: Certainly, Mr. Benedict.
N: Benedict and Linus wait, side-by-side. While Linus does his best to play it cool, Benedict dips into his portfolio.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - ON LIVINGSTON'S MONITOR - NIGHT
N: An overhead view of Benedict as he pulls out the combination to the vault, reads it, then buries it in his jacket pocket.
C: RUSTY
D: Did you make it out?
C: LIVINGSTON
D: His head blocked the last two numbers. We missed it, Linus. You gotta grab the combination yourself.
E: into his microphone
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
N: Linus half-nods in response, and Benedict notices. Suspicious of the young man, he decides to test him.
C: BENEDICT
D: You new at the commission?
C: LINUS
D: Been there about two years.
C: BENEDICT
D: I know Hal Lindley over there. You work with him at all?
C: LINUS
D: Not since he died last year.
E: a pause; will he pass?
N: He passes. The Pit Boss returns with Frank in tow.
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Escalante. Would you come with us, please?
C: FRANK
D: What's this about?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 103.
C: BENEDICT
D: I think it's better if we talked off the floor.
N: Linus and Benedict lead Frank away. As they pass an elevator... ... its doors open, revealing Turk and Virgil, dressed now as security guards, pushing out the false-lid cash cart. They leave behind a pile of dishes, waiter uniforms, a tablecloth.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - 24:26
N: and counting. A MAITRE D' scours his reservations list, then peers up to find Reuben Tishkoff approaching, on either side of him two gorgeous young women, all blonde hair and breasts and legs, women who wouldn't give Hefner the time of day.
C: MAITRE D'
D: Good evening, Mr. Tishkoff.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Good evening, Marcel. My nieces and I would like a table. Something quiet before the fight.
C: MAITRE D'
D: I can put you at 19 in just a couple minutes.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Quick as you can. The meter's running here.
E: re: the girls
N: The Maitre d' turns to his next customer: Tess. She, of course, merits a table instantly.
C: MAITRE D'
D: Good evening, Miss Ocean. Right this way...
N: Reuben can't help but stare as Tess passes by. His eyes linger a little too long and a little too low...
C: VOICE
D: Hey...
E: O.S.
N: Reuben pivots; it's Danny, and he strolls past Reuben and his lady friends and into the restaurant... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 104.
C: DANNY
D: Try to keep your tongue in your mouth.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Yeah, pal, well only if you take your thumb out of your...
E: shocked to see Danny; thinks he's off the job, but covering
N: ... Reuben gets brushed from behind by the two Plainclothes Goons following Danny.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Hey: you have any idea who I think I am?
E: outraged
N: AT TESS'S USUAL TABLE Just as she's sitting, Danny approaches. She goes straight at him, apoplectic.
C: TESS
D: Danny: No.
C: DANNY
D: I'll just be a moment.
C: TESS
D: I'm having you thrown out of here.
N: She starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and she wheels on him.
C: TESS
D: You're up to something, Danny. What? And don't say you came here for me. You're pulling a job, aren't you?
C: DANNY
D: Tess...
C: TESS
D: Well, know this: no matter what it is, you won't win me back. I can't afford it.
C: DANNY
D: I just came to say good-bye.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 105. This surprises Tess, and, truth be told, saddens her; she studies him a moment, unsure of what to say.
C: TESS
D: Oh... then... good-bye.
C: DANNY
D: Good-bye.
N: Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it...
C: DANNY
D: Be good.
N: Danny leaves her. Tess watches him go.
C: TESS
D: Good-bye, Danny.
E: already missing him
N: AT RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE Danny runs smack into the Plainclothes Goons. PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1 Mr. Ocean. Mr. Benedict would like to see you.
C: DANNY
D: I thought he might.
E: resignedly, these men are much too big to tangle with
N: The Plainclothes Goons escort Danny away, right past Reuben who frowns, concerned.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO MANAGER'S OFFICE - 18:25
N: Frank stands at attention before Linus and Benedict. Linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt when it pinches him. Benedict checks his watch: the fight's opening bell is growing closer and closer.
C: LINUS
D: Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Escalante. Or should I call you Mr. Catton?
E: as Frank nods, not at all
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 105A. Frank bristles, tries not to let it show. Linus pulls out a Xeroxed mug shot and bio of him.
C: LINUS
D: You are Frank Catton? Formerly of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary system?
E: MORE
C: LINUS
D: Your silence suggests you don't refute that. Mr. Benedict, I'm afraid you've been employing an ex-convict. As you know, the N.G.C. strictly forbids...
E: CONT'D as Frank remains quiet to Benedict
C: FRANK
D: Goddamn cracker...
E: under his breath
C: LINUS
D: Pardon me.
E: a pause; he can't believe he just heard that
C: FRANK
D: You heard me. Just 'cause a black man tries to earn a decent wage in this state...
E: leering at Linus, simmering
C: LINUS
D: That has nothing to do with...
C: FRANK
D: ... some cracker cowboy like you's gotta kick him out on the street. Want me to jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton, won't let me deal cards, might as well call it whitejack.
E: over him, ranting
C: LINUS
D: I resent your implication that race has anything to do with this. Now, as I was saying, the Nevada Gaming Commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored... ... I mean...
E: a beat, then to Benedict whoops
N: That does it: Frank attacks Linus, lunging at the man, and as Benedict steps in to separate the two... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 3/30/01 107. ... Linus's hand dips into his tuxedo jacket and withdraws the vault combination.
C: FRANK
D: Okay, okay, I'm cool.
C: BENEDICT
D: You alright?
E: to Linus
C: LINUS
D: Yeah.
E: a beat, then
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
C: RUSTY
D: He's got it. Virgil, Turk: deliver your package.
E: hearing this into his mike
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - 14:05
N: Two guards stand sentry outside the cage door. Virgil and Turk move up with their cash cart, and when Virgil reaches for his keycard... it's gone.
C: VIRGIL
D: Aw, I think... Jesus. I lost my card.
N: The guards frown at him. A SECURITY OFFICER approaches.
C: SECURITY OFFICER
D: What's going on here?
C: VIRGIL
D: I think... Jesus! I lost my keycard.
C: SECURITY OFFICER
D: Okay. Leave the cart. Go find it. Take this cart inside.
E: and this, he knows, will get this guard fired to one of the sentries
N: The sentry nods, swipes his keycard, and enters with the cash cart. Turk and Virgil hesitate a moment to watch it enter, then hurry off. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 108.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: On a monitor: The sentry pushes the cart down a cage corridor. On another: Saul's briefcase is escorted by another guard to the vault elevator. On another: Danny is escorted inside the cage by the Plainclothes Goons.
C: WALSH
D: There it is now.
C: SAUL
D: Wonderful.
E: beginning to sweat this a bit, nerves overtaking him
N: ON MONITORS The yen-filled cash cart joins Saul's briefcase on the elevator. PULL OUT to...
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - 11:19
C: RUSTY
D: That's my cue. Give Basher the go.
E: as he exits
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Bash, what's your status?
E: into mike
S: EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - MOVING WITH BASHER - NIGHT
N: driving the white van, listening to a books-on-tape of Jane Eyre.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Bash!
E: V.O.
C: BASHER
D: No need to yell.
E: turning Bronte down
C: LIVINGSTON
D: What's your status?
E: V.O.
C: BASHER
D: I'm there.
N: And he SCREECHES to a halt on the parking structure's top level. Vegas can be seen in every direction. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 109.
S: INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - 08:36
N: and counting. Benedict exits the casino Manager's office with Linus and Frank. Benedict hails two GUARDS...
C: BENEDICT
D: Please show this man off the premises. Don't step foot in my casino again.
E: to Frank
C: FRANK
D: Cracker.
E: as he's led away, over his shoulder, to Linus
N: Benedict checks his watch again: he's really running late.
C: BENEDICT
D: Mr. Wills, if you don't mind... Mr. Wills?
E: as Linus forgets to respond
C: LINUS
D: Of course.
N: They start toward the exit. But halfway there...
C: LINUS
D: My beeper. I'm sorry. I forgot it.
N: Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras all about and he decides to risk it.
C: BENEDICT
D: You know how to get back out?
C: LINUS
D: Of course. Enjoy the fight.
C: BENEDICT
D: Thank you.
E: shaking his hand, then hurrying away
N: Linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of combinations he lifted off the man. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 110.
S: EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - 06:47
N: and counting. The Guards show Frank out. Frank tries to tip them...
C: FRANK
D: Thanks, fellas.
N: ... but they snarl at him before returning inside. Frank smiles and goes on his way, his job complete.
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - 06:36
N: Danny sits opposite two Plainclothes Goons in absolute silence, waiting.
C: DANNY
D: How much longer do you think Mr. Benedict will be?
N: GOON #1 Just a few minutes more. He scans the room.
C: DANNY
D: No cameras in this room, huh? Don't want anyone seeing what happens here?
N: The Goons say nothing. Danny checks his watch.
C: DANNY
D: He's not coming, is he?
N: The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their bluff.
C: DANNY
D: Who is?
N: There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile: Danny's about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher in... ... the BRUISER, come to beat the shit out of Danny Ocean. The guy's at least six-six, three hundred pounds, but it's not his size that draws attention, it's his teeth... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 111. ... or the lack thereof; the Bruiser doesn't hold a single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth. Gum city. And there's something really terrifying about the sight.
C: DANNY
D: I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like me talking to his girl.
N: The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a hole in this man. The Goons head for the door. GOON #1 We're gonna step outside now. Leave you two alone to talk things over. The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little blood from his lip.
C: DANNY
D: Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.
C: BRUISER
D: Sorry, Danny. I -- I forgot.
C: DANNY
D: S'okay. How's the wife?
E: shaking it off
C: BRUISER
D: Pregnant again.
C: DANNY
D: Then we better get to work.
N: OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM Standing guard outside, the Goons hear PUNCHES and GROANS from inside as...
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
N: ... Danny climbs onto Bruiser's shoulders and pushes through the ceiling rafters, groaning every time Bruiser slaps his fist into his hand. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 112.
S: A181 INT. VAULT A181
N: A guard wheels in the Yen-filled cash cart, parks it in a station next to its twin, then -- as an afterthought -- plants Saul's briefcase right on top if it -- clunk -- an unforeseen obstacle to Yen's escape.
S: B181 INT. MIRADOR SUITE B181
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Oh shit...
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - 04:30
N: Saul witnesses this, too, and stifles a reaction.
C: WALSH
D: Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?
C: SAUL
D: Yes, I'm very satisfied.
C: WALSH
D: Close it up.
E: to Slim
N: On the monitor, the vault door closes, but Saul looks anything but satisfied. He's sweaty, his mouth's so dry he can't swallow, and he keeps patting down his pockets for his Rolaids, without finding them.
C: FAT
D: You alright, sir?
S: INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - MOVING WITH LINUS - 04:02
N: as he circumspectly approaches the vault-elevator door, checking up and down hallways for guards.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: On a monitor, Linus comes into view...
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Almost there, kid.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: ... and Saul spots him, but so does Fat... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 112A.
C: FAT
D: Who's that?
N: ... and Saul can't handle the suspense: He grips his arm and groans and this is no ulcer problem, this is a full- fledged cardiac, and Walsh, Fat, and Slim all attend to him, their backs turned as...
S: INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - 03:42
N: ... Linus hurries to the elevator, punching Benedict's combination into a keypad. The elevator doors open for him. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 113.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: Livingston punches a few keys...
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Going to video now.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: As Saul and his heart attack hold the spotlight, a security monitor flips from a shot of Linus entering the elevator to a Livingston-fed videotape of an empty lift.
C: WALSH
D: Call for a doctor.
E: as Saul passes out
S: INT. ELEVATOR - 03:15
N: Linus immediately reaches up to the elevator's ceiling, rips down its panel to reveal a trap door. As he starts to push it open... ... a hand yanks it free from above. It's Danny.
C: DANNY
D: You didn't really think I was gonna sit this one out, did you?
C: LINUS
D: What, didn't you trust me?
C: DANNY
D: I do now.
N: He reaches down and pulls Linus, wide-eyed, up to the roof of the elevator.
S: INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA - 3:00
N: The boxers enter the ring before a full, cheering house. Benedict and Tess find their ringside seats, a row in front of Reuben and his "nieces."
C: RING ANNOUNCER
D: Ladies and gentlemen!!
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - 02:56
N: Rusty approaches the sentry on duty at the cage door.
C: RUSTY
D: Someone called for a doctor?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 114.
S: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE ELEVATOR - 02:21
N: Danny rips off his jacket and shirt to expose a rappelling line wrapped around his torso. Linus does the same.
C: LINUS
D: How'd you get here?
C: DANNY
D: Crawlspace. And I had to give away a couple mil.
C: LINUS
D: But what about -- I mean, that whole thing with Rusty...
N: Danny just smiles at him.
S: A192 FLASHBACK - EXT. MIRADOR SUITE - BALCONY A192
N: Earlier that night, just after Rusty kicked Danny off the job. As Linus watches from inside, deaf to their conversation, blind to their expressions, Danny and Rusty confer.
C: DANNY
D: You think the kid bought it?
C: RUSTY
D: Hell, I think Reuben bought it, and he knew we were screwing around. You sure about this?
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: Bobby Caldwell threw me into the pool first time. Least I could do is give his kid a push.
E: nods
S: B192 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE ELEVATOR (PRESENT) B192
C: LINUS
D: Why'd you make me go through all this? Why not just tell me?
C: DANNY
D: Well, where's the fun in that? C'mon: Yen's got about three minutes of air left.
E: starting toward elevator shaft ladder
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 115. B192 CONTINUED: B192 Danny leads Linus down and around the elevator and side- by-side they crawl onto the bottom of the elevator, gripping the undercarriage of the lift to keep from falling. Meanwhile, we DESCEND QUICKLY DOWN the shaft, just to illustrate how very high up they are.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - 00:53
N: Rusty, playing doctor, inspects Saul. At the same time, he inspects a monitor: the vault door closing with the Yen-filled cash cart and Saul's briefcase inside. Rusty stops, listens to Saul's chest, then drops his head...
C: RUSTY
D: He's gone.
N: Walsh, Fat and Slim all bow their heads. At the door, two paramedics arrive with a stretcher.
C: WALSH
D: You're too late, guys. He's dead.
N: The first paramedic turns to his partner and admonishes him:
C: VIRGIL
D: I told you to hurry.
E: to Turk
S: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BELOW ELEVATOR - 00:42
N: As Danny and Linus work, affixing suction-cupped anchors to their rappelling lines...
C: DANNY
D: Who do you like tonight?
C: LINUS
D: Huh?
C: DANNY
D: Tyson or Lewis.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 116.
C: LINUS
D: The fight...? Lewis. You like Tyson? How strongly do you feel about it?
E: as Danny nods as Danny shoots him a look as Danny nods
C: DANNY
D: You looking for action?
C: LINUS
D: I'd go in for a buck.
E: shrugs
C: DANNY
D: A buck it is.
N: And they're ready, poised at the top, looking into the abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared sensors.
C: DANNY
D: Livingston, we're set.
E: into his mike
S: A194 INT. CASINO FLOOR - OUTSIDE CAGES A194
N: Rusty leads the "paramedics" out, with "dead" Saul on their gurney.
C: RUSTY
D: Livingston, we're set.
E: into his mike
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - 00:21
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Basher, we're set.
E: hearing this, into his mike
S: EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - 00:17
C: BASHER
D: Just give me a minute.
E: fixing the pinch atop his van
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 117.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: We don't have a minute. Yen's gonna pass out in thirteen seconds.
E: V.O.
C: BASHER
D: Then give me thirteen seconds.
N: And Basher leaps down to hook up the pinch's wires to his van's engine.
S: INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA - 00:10
N: The opening BELL RINGS -- round one. The fighters break from their corners, feinting, jabbing... Sitting ringside: Benedict looks at Tess and smiles as she winces at the first sharp blow.
S: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BELOW ELEVATOR - 00:05
N: Peering down into blackness, Danny and Linus prepare to let go any moment...
C: LINUS
D: You ever rappelled before?
C: DANNY
D: Never. You?
C: LINUS
D: Nope.
S: EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - 00:01
N: Basher finishes preparations.
C: BASHER
D: Ready.
E: into his mike
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Then hit it.
E: V.O. over earpiece
N: Basher flips the switch. BOOM! A quick TREMOR, then stillness. He picks a point on the horizon, like Babe Ruth, and suddenly...
C: BASHER
D: ... One...
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 118. HIGH ABOVE LAS VEGAS whole blocks of lights disappear. Casinos vanishing one- by-one. FLAMINGO Every pink light vanishes. BELLAGIO The fountain goes flaccid.
C: BASHER
D: ... two, three...
E: V.O.
N: NEW YORK, NEW YORK The roller coaster stops dead; its passengers keep their arms raised, not sure what to do. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA Both fighters move in simultaneously, sweat flying, both reach back, both going for the lights-out power cut to the jaw, when... lights out.
C: BASHER
D: ... four, five...
E: V.O.
S: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
N: Blip -- out go the infrared sensors.
C: DANNY
D: Now!
N: And he and Linus lean forward and fall... HURTLING WITH DANNY AND LINUS DOWN the elevator shaft. Upside down, heads curled, and all we hear is the WHOOSH of their bodies in motion and the WHIRL of their CORDS UNCOILING. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 119.
C: BASHER
D: ... six, seven.....
E: V.O.
N: And now, looking STRAIGHT DOWN, the ground is rising up fast to meet them, a flat slab of gray concrete -- fifty feet, forty feet, thirty feet, twenty...
C: BASHER
D: ... eight, nine...
N: And SNAP -- the CORDS reach their full extension, and Danny and Linus bounce up, watching the floor recede.
C: LINUS
D: Aaaaahhhhh!
S: EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - NIGHT
C: BASHER
D: ... ten...
N: In the distance, lights come up again, first at the Mirage, then the MGM, gradually approaching...
S: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BOTTOM
N: Coming to a rest about ten feet from the floor, Danny quickly pulls a slim blade and slashes the two coils straight across. He and Linus go tumbling to the floor as their drop lines recoil lightning fast to their elevator anchors, just before... ... the infrared lights go back on-line.
S: INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA
N: The lights suddenly flash back on, revealing... ... both fighters standing, and Tyson takes advantage of Lewis's disorientation and throws a sucker punch to his jaw. Down goes Lewis, and up goes the crowd, roaring.
C: REF
D: ... One, two, three...
N: Benedict makes a quick survey; the arena is apoplectic from the blackout-knockout.
C: BENEDICT
D: What the hell was that?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 120. He cranes his neck, looking around the room, surveying his empire: he smells a rat. His eyes fall on Reuben behind him, but Reuben just shrugs: "I didn't pull the plug."
C: BENEDICT
D: The first goddamn round.
E: to himself
S: EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - NIGHT
N: All the lights are back on, and Basher observes his achievement with great pride, his job complete.
C: BASHER
D: Viva Las Vegas.
S: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BOTTOM
N: Linus and Danny arise from where they've fallen, clutching their heads and rubbing bruises. Danny doesn't recover as quickly.
C: LINUS
D: You alright?
C: DANNY
D: No, but you're sweet to ask.
S: INT. BELLAGIO VAULT
N: Lights are just flickering on here when... ... the false lid of the cash cart thrust upward slightly. It's Yen trying to get out, out of air and only now alert to Saul's heavy case resting atop him.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: Livingston watches this on his monitors, just coming back on, his finger poised on a play button, as Frank comes in the door.
C: FRANK
D: Are they in?
C: LIVINGSTON
D: One second. I thought you got kicked out?
E: a look at him
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 121. Frank shrugs. Suddenly one of the monitors aligns itself, and Livingston presses play. ON MONITOR A Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty. And of the vault itself: Yen trying to get out of the cash cart. ON MONITOR B Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty... and in totally different positions. Of the vault: no cash cart, but no Zerga briefcase, no Yen. LIVINGSTON
C: LIVINGSTON
D: This tape's from last night. Same guards, same...
N: His eyes fixing on Saul's briefcase pushing closer to the edge of the cash cart as Yen tries to free himself.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: ... shift.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: The room is abuzz with activity. The monitors here flicker back on, too, displaying the images from monitor B, but every watcher in the place is watching a table because...
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
N: ... the floor is going nuts. After the ten seconds of darkness, all bets are off. Some players doubled-down during the blackout, others miraculously halved their bets. Consequently, Livingston's video feed switch goes unnoticed. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 122.
S: INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE VAULT
N: Danny and Linus pry open the elevator doors and squeeze out. Just beyond the next doorway stand... ... three UZI-CARRYING GUARDS, hovering outside the vault door and wondering what the hell just happened to the lights.
S: A215 INT. VAULT A215
N: Yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the more he pushes, the more Saul's briefcase slides off. Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.
S: B215 INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE VAULT B215
N: The Uzi-Carrying Guards turn their backs to the elevator shaft... ... and Linus and Danny appear in the doorway; they both snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor. UZI-CARRYING GUARD #1 (sniffing something) Jesus, Ron, was that you? OUTSIDE VAULT CORRIDOR Linus and Danny wait, Danny silently mouthing a three- count before... THUD, THUD, THUD. They peer around the corridor to find... All three Uzi-carrying guards lie unconscious on the ground. Linus starts in, Danny holds him back...
C: DANNY
D: Not yet. Okay.
E: a beat; another beat; then
S: INT. VAULT CORRIDOR
N: Danny and Linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards' bodies.
C: LINUS
D: You think Yen made it out okay?
C: DANNY
D: I'm sure he's fine.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 122A.
S: A217 INT. VAULT A217
N: Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart, which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out to grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid until... ... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor... ... but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached to it and swings it round. He's got it. That threat over, he throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath of his life.
S: B217 INT. VAULT CORRIDOR B217
N: Linus punches in the code for the door to the vault anteroom (the one he stole from Benedict). He steps back as it slides open, revealing -- -- the vault door: it is sleek and immense and impregnable.
C: LINUS
D: Jesus...
E: jaw dropping
C: DANNY
D: There's a Chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars behind that door. Let's get him out.
N: Danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard.
S: INT. VAULT
N: Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's "emeralds"). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he knows: it's time for his leap. It's the same distance as the leap he made in the practice session, but this time he's only got one good hand.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE
N: Frank and Livingston watch nervously.
C: FRANK
D: Fin says he shorts it.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: No bet.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 123.
S: INT. VAULT
N: Yen prepares for his leap, then springs... ... across the room, to the ledge he must grab... ... and he grabs it, but with only one hand he's slipping right away, and in a second he'll hit the sensored floor... ... but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs, propping himself up between two walls, inches above the floor. An acrobatic wonder.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE
N: Frank and Livingston exhale.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Shit.
E: wishing he had bet
N: OUTSIDE VAULT Danny, oblivious to this close call, slaps the door again. A moment passes, then: Yen responds with a slap, too.
C: DANNY
D: Okay.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: As Basher enters, Livingston and Frank watch on a monitor Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a detonator.
C: FRANK
D: That's it?
C: LIVINGSTON
D: There's still the five pins and the floor sensor. Not much we can do about that from this side of the door. But from this side...
N: He punches up the image of Yen in the vault.
C: BASHER
D: ... a little bit of Semtex should do the trick.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 124.
S: INT. VAULT
N: Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is. He affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set. A224 OUTSIDE VAULT A224 Danny responds with two slaps of his own. He steps back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault door.
C: DANNY
D: Counting down from twenty -- -- now.
E: checking watch
S: B224 INT. VAULT B224
N: Yen starts his retreat from the door, but gets yanked back. His hand's bandage is caught on the door. C224 OUTSIDE VAULT C224
C: DANNY
D: -- seventeen, sixteen, fifteen --
S: D224 INT. VAULT D224
N: Yen tries to free himself, but he can't use his other hand lest he drop to the floor. He tries gnawing at his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a plastic explosive. E224 OUTSIDE VAULT E224
C: DANNY
D: -- eleven, ten, nine --
S: F224 INT. MIRADOR SUITE F224
N: Livingston et al. are alert to the danger.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: Linus, can you read me? Linus, do not blow the door, you're about to kill Yen.
E: into his mike
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 124A. G224 OUTSIDE VAULT G224 Linus hears nothing through his earpiece.
C: LINUS
D: -- five, four, three --
S: H224 INT. VAULT H224
N: Yen finally frees himself just as -- -- ZOOMING INTO a plastic explosive -- I-224 OUTSIDE VAULT I-224
C: DANNY
D: -- one --
N: He presses his detonator. Nothing.
S: J224 INT. VAULT J224
N: Yen, still on the door, remains frozen. Trembling. A beat. Then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he can get. K224 OUTSIDE VAULT K224 Danny presses it again. Still nothing.
C: LINUS
D: What's wrong?
C: DANNY
D: I don't know.
N: Linus comes over to look.
C: LINUS
D: You check the batteries?
N: Danny blanches. Linus shoots him a look. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 124B.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: Livingston, Frank, and Basher watch the monitors in disbelief... Saul enters, alive and dressed as himself again. His job is complete.
C: SAUL
D: Everything going okay?
S: INT. VAULT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE VAULT
N: As Danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in power meters: both at zero percent), Linus ransacks the Uzi-carrying Guards' gear for replacements. He finds AA's in their flashlights.
C: LINUS
D: You know, you lose focus for one second in this game --
C: DANNY
D: -- and someone gets hurt, yeah yeah. I don't hear Yen complaining.
N: He takes the batteries, inserts them in his detonator, then slaps the door twice more.
S: A226 INT. VAULT A226
N: Yen catches his breath on the far end of the room. He hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the line of fire. B226 OUTSIDE VAULT B226 Danny presses the detonator.
S: C226 INT. VAULT C226
N: The "EMERALDS" EXPLODE. D226 OUTSIDE VAULT D226 Several MUTED but powerful BLASTS. Linus inches forward, almost dreading this moment, pauses... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 124C. D226 CONTINUED: D226
C: DANNY
D: Do it.
N: Linus pulls... and the door opens.
S: INT. VAULT
N: Danny and Linus enter. Silence. The cash carts have crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held.
C: DANNY
D: Amazing?
N: Linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens it... Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone.
C: YEN
D: Where the fuck you been?
E: his only English
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: Livingston, Frank, Saul, and Basher watch as the first wave of bills gets tossed onto the vault floor. Smiles all around.
C: SAUL
D: Ever been in love?
C: FRANK
D: No, I guess not. Not really.
E: considers it for a moment
C: SAUL
D: This is better.
S: INT. CASINO - OUTSIDE FIGHT ARENA
N: Rusty steps forward as people stream past him out of the fight arena. He dials his cell phone, listens...
S: INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA
N: MOVING WITH Benedict and Tess, pushing their way out through the crowd. A PHONE is RINGING nearby... again and again...
C: BENEDICT
D: You gonna answer it?
C: TESS
D: I don't have a cell phone.
N: They keep moving, but the RING pursues them. Finally, Benedict stops, pulls Tess's purse from her shoulder and opens it: inside, he finds a CELL PHONE, RINGING.
C: TESS
D: It isn't mine.
C: BENEDICT
D: See who's on the other end.
N: She takes the phone, activates it.
C: TESS
D: Hello?
C: RUSTY
D: May I have a word with Mr. Benedict, please?
E: V.O.
N: Tess looks up, confused.
C: TESS
D: It's for you.
N: Benedict takes the phone.
C: BENEDICT
D: Who the hell is this?
N: ON RUSTY in the distance, at the arena's exit, unseen by Benedict or Tess, on the phone...
C: RUSTY
D: The man who's robbing you.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: Benedict enters, and fear enters with him. And, of course, Tess. As the room buzzes with activity, he keeps the cell phone pressed to his ear.
C: BENEDICT
D: What the hell is going on down there in the vault?
C: FAT
D: Nothing, sir. All normal.
C: BENEDICT
D: Show me.
N: Fat points to the security-cam view of the vault corridor and vault -- Livingston's tape.
C: FAT
D: All quiet.
C: BENEDICT
D: I'm afraid you're mistaken.
E: on phone, venomously
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: Frank, Basher and Saul watch over Livingston's shoulder as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small speaker.
C: RUSTY
D: You're watching your monitor? Okay, keep watching.
E: V.O.
N: Livingston punches in numbers...
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY -
N: ON FAT'S MONITOR New images suddenly appear. Three masked men in the vault throw stacks of money onto the floor; the three Uzi Guards lie bound and unconscious in the corridor. The security center, understandably, erupts in activity.
C: BENEDICT
D: Jesus Christ...
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 127.
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
N: Rusty strolls so casually there's no reason anyone passing would suspect he was doing more than ordering a pizza.
C: RUSTY
D: In this town, your luck can change just that quickly.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER
C: BENEDICT
D: Find out how much money we have down there.
E: close to apoplectic, takes a breath and cups the phone, then barks at Walsh
N: Tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious: how did that cell phone get into her handbag? And suddenly it hits her...
S: A235 FLASHBACK - INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER THAT EVENING A235
C: DANNY
D: Good-bye.
N: Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it... ... as he slips the cell phone into her handbag, unnoticed.
C: BENEDICT
D: Alright. You've proved your point. You've broken into my vault. Congratulations: you're a dead man.
E: on phone
N: Tess leaves.

D: Do you believe I'll simply allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors?
N: A distance beyond Rusty, Tess exits the cages. She stops, puzzling over what to do, happens to spot him.
C: RUSTY
D: No. You're gonna carry it out for us.
C: BENEDICT
D: And why would I do that?
E: has to laugh
C: RUSTY
D: Take a closer look at your monitor...
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 128A.
S: INT. SECURITY CENTER
N: Benedict does. As the three masked men stuff money into large canvas bags and mark the bags with X's, another portion of cash remains untouched, booby-trapped.
C: RUSTY
D: As your manager's probably reporting to you by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight.
E: V.O.
N: And, as if Rusty was in the room watching, Walsh approaches with the night's cash count: $163,156,759.
C: RUSTY
D: You may notice: we're only packing up about half that. The other half we're leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as a hostage.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CASINO FLOOR
C: RUSTY
D: You let our eighty million go, and you get to keep your eighty. That's the deal. You try and stop us, we'll blow both cash loads.
N: He spins and -- gasp -- comes face-to-face with Tess. She stares at him directly: she knows.
C: RUSTY
D: Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly. It's your decision.
E: holding her glance
N: He cups the phone.
C: RUSTY
D: Hi.
S: INT. SECURITY CENTER
N: Benedict cups his phone, too, and vents his rage. He knows what he should do -- let the money go -- and he knows what he wants to do -- stop these sonsabitches. He makes his choice...
C: BENEDICT
D: Make the call.
E: to Walsh
N: Walsh grabs a phone, punches numbers...
C: VOICE
D: 911. Emergency response...
E: V.O.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: Livingston listens in on the call...
C: WALSH
D: Hello, this is Mr. Walsh at the Bellagio.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SECURITY CENTER
C: WALSH
D: We have an incident here...
C: BENEDICT
D: Okay. You have a deal.
E: uncupping his phone
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 130.
S: INT. CASINO FLOOR
N: Tess and Rusty hold a stare as Rusty holds the phone.
C: TESS
D: Where's Danny?
C: RUSTY
D: He's fine. He wants you to go upstairs, and watch TV.
C: TESS
D: He does?
E: a little pissed
C: BENEDICT
D: You have a deal.
E: V.O.
C: RUSTY
D: It's alright, Tess. I promise. Good. Here's what you do. Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator.
E: back on phone
N: Tess isn't sure what to do. As Rusty continues on the phone, she backs off, debating: can she blow the whistle on her ex?
S: INT. VAULT ELEVATOR - CLOSE ON SIX CANVAS BAGS
N: each sealed tight, each marked with an X, loaded onto the vault elevator.
C: RUSTY
D: If they meet anyone, we'll blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CAGE - OUTSIDE VAULT ELEVATOR
N: A small cadre of guards await the arrival of the vault elevator. Its doors open to reveal the six large canvas bags, each sealed tight, marked with an X.
C: RUSTY
D: One minute after that, the elevator will rise to your cages. Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino.
E: V.O.
N: Six guards do precisely that.
S: INT. CASINO - NIGHT
N: MOVING WITH Rusty PAST slot machines...
C: RUSTY
D: If they take more than twenty seconds to reach the casino floor or if there's any indication a switch has been made, we'll blow the money in the vault and the money in the bags.
N: A SLOT MACHINE RINGS behind him...
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: ... and Benedict hears it.
C: BENEDICT
D: He's in the casino right now.
E: to Walsh
C: RUSTY
D: Of course, I'm in the casino. In fact, I'm staying in your hotel. And I have two words for you: mini-bar. Now as soon as your guards hit the casino floor...
E: V.O. back to business
S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
N: The six guards appear from the cage door, carrying six canvas bags marked with X's; Bellagio security escorts them from the building.
C: RUSTY
D: ... a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
N: The white VAN (now clean of the "Nevada Telecom" sign) IDLES before the Bellagio, its windows tinted, the driver's identity inscrutable. It is swarmed by security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.
C: RUSTY
D: Your guards will load the bags into the van's rear. If anyone so much as approaches the driver's door, we blow everything.
E: V.O.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 132. The guards carry out the money and load it into the van's rear. There, they find a video camera mounted within the back seat of the van monitoring them. Still they cannot catch a glimpse of the driver. They close the van doors. BELLAGIO - FROM HIGH ABOVE The white van departs the valet station in front, clandestinely shadowed by five sedans. Meanwhile, behind the casino, a SWAT van arrives and unloads its squad.
C: BENEDICT
D: Now what?
E: V.O.
C: RUSTY
D: Now, when I get word that the van hasn't been followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and once their safety is confirmed, you'll get your vault back.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: Walsh mouths to Benedict: "SWAT team is here." Benedict nods and throws him a thumbs-up.
C: BENEDICT
D: Sir, I have complied with your every request, would you agree?
C: RUSTY
D: I would.
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: Good. Now I have one of my own.
C: RUSTY
D: Yes?
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: Run and hide. If you get picked up next week buying a $100,000 sports car in Newport Beach, I'll be supremely disappointed. Because I want my people to find you. And rest assured: when they do, they won't hand you over to the police. Run and hide. That's all I ask.
E: at last, his venom released beat
N: And during the above rant by Benedict, we view... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 133. MIRADOR SUITE now empty, Livingston's monitors still displaying the masked men in the vault. WHITE VAN navigating the streets of Las Vegas. FIVE SEDANS tailing the van, security goons piled into each, and maybe we NOTICE (or maybe not) the Rolls-Royce tailing them. TESS pacing in Benedict's suite, biting her nails, debating whether to blow the whistle on Danny. ON TV: a newscast of the contentious aftermath of the prize fight. A254 UZI GUARDS, A254 bound and unarmed, unconscious to the activity within the vault. RUSTY'S CELL PHONE opened and unmanned. A255 BENEDICT A255 listens -- the line has gone dead. He hangs up.
C: WALSH
D: Our guys say the van is headed toward McCarren Airport.
C: BENEDICT
D: Get everyone in position. I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac.
T: LONGER MONTAGE now, CUTTING BETWEEN:
N: SWAT TEAM (six in all) hustling through the cage corridors, armed to the teeth, with body armor and helmets and vision guards: they're as faceless as storm troopers. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 134. WHITE VAN CONVOY as it approaches McCarren Airport. MONITORS OF THE VAULT The three masked men pace beside the booby-trapped money.

C: BENEDICT
D: Where's Zerga? Mr. Zerga? With the briefcase?
E: on second inspection off Walsh's sheepish look
C: WALSH
D: He's -- he died.
N: Benedict shoots him a slow, sideways glance. SWAT TEAM rappelling down the elevator shaft -- its ultraviolet sensors turned off by Walsh -- then moving into position...

C: SWAT LEADER
D: Night goggles on. Prepare to cut power.
E: V.O. over radio, on monitor
N: Fat mans the power switch.
C: FAT
D: Ready when you are.
N: Benedict scours the monitors: The masked men continue to pace on one screen. The SWAT team prepares to invade on another.
C: BENEDICT
D: Do it.
C: SWAT LEADER
D: Cut it.
E: V.O. over radio
N: Fat flips the power switch. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 135.
S: INT. MIRADOR SUITE
N: Livingston's monitors all go black.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: The monitors here go black as well. Benedict listens closely to the SWAT frequency.
C: SWAT FREQUENCY
D: First wave, in! Second wave, now! Guys, someone's here! Take him down! Now!
E: V.O. Leader's voice there is RUNNING, PANTING, then Linus's voice, distant and panicked Leader's voice
N: A brief SPURT of GUNFIRE, then... BARRROOOOOOM! Dead silence in the Eye in the Sky. Slim stares deep into a monitor's dark pitch. Then...
C: SWAT FREQUENCY
D: Lights! We need power now!
E: V.O. Leader's voice
N: Fat flips the power back on, and on the monitors... ... visions of destruction down below... smoke fills the vault as two SWAT members push through it... other SWAT members help evacuate the unconscious guards...
C: BENEDICT
D: What's the situation down there?
E: into intercom
C: SWAT LEADER
D: They blew it. They blew the... Oh, Jesus... If there was anyone in there, they're not in one piece anymore.
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: Tell them to take the van. I'm going down there. Find out how they fiddled with our cameras.
E: to Walsh, soberly as an afterthought, to Slim
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 135A. EXT. McCARREN AIRPORT - NIGHT As the white van arrives at a charter airline's entrance, the five sedans converge upon it, TIRES SCREECHING, Goons emerging, weapons drawn.
C: HEAD GOON
D: Get out of the van, now! Now!
N: No response within the van. The Head Goon signals and the others SHOOT the van's tires.
S: INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM
N: Slim investigates the Eye in the Sky's wiring. Reaching deep into a mesh, he finds a foreign object: Livingston's "spider."
S: INT. VAULT CORRIDOR
N: The vault elevator doors open and Terry Benedict makes his way into his smoke-filled vault corridor. He passes the Uzi Guards, awake now and stumbling to the elevator with SWAT members' assistance, then arrives before his decimated vault: Anything within -- people, money, Lyman Zerga's emeralds -- could only have been destroyed. OVER SWAT LEADER'S SHOULDER as he approaches Benedict.
C: SWAT LEADER
D: Mr. Benedict...
C: BENEDICT
D: Yes.
C: SWAT LEADER
D: We couldn't find any survivors. Or, I'm afraid, any of your money. I'm sorry, sir.
C: BENEDICT
D: Take your men out now.
E: doesn't want to hear anymore; the SWAT team failed him
N: HOLD ON Benedict, seething, as the SWAT Leader steps away...
C: SWAT LEADER
D: Okay, guys, grab your gear and clear out.
C: BENEDICT
D: Walsh: How are we with the van?
E: into walkie-talkie he has with him
N: EXT. McCARREN AIRPORT - NIGHT The stalemate with the van continues. Still no movement from inside. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 137.
C: HEAD GOON
D: Out of the van now! Hands up!
N: An EMPLOYEE from the charter airline sticks his head out of his office door.
C: EMPLOYEE
D: Hey, what's going on here?
E: innocently
N: Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction. The Employee disappears back inside his office. The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for the driver's door, and yanks it open... Inside: There is no driver. Just a video camera mounted at eye-level. The Head Goon cranes back his head, befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's rear bumper. The van suddenly lurches. SHORT DISTANCE AWAY - CLOSE ON REMOTE CONTROL complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van driver's POV) and a steering mechanism -- it's a near- replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster truck drag race against his brother. And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons scramble back from the flat-tired van.
C: TISHKOFF
D: Enough monkey business.
N: Virgil brings the van to a stop, then readies a distinctive red button on his remote. BACK WITH VAN As the Head Goon reaches for the rear door, his hand inches away when... ... BARROOOOM! The door EXPLODES open! Knocked on his ass, the Head Goon watches as the canvas "X" bags within burn to cinders. He does, however, happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged from a bag: It's a promotional flier for a call girl service. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 138.
S: INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT
N: Benedict steps over the scattered remains of his vault. He picks up a fragment of a cash cart, burnt to a crisp, then lets it drop.
C: WALSH
D: Mr. Benedict...
E: V.O. over walkie-talkie
C: BENEDICT
D: Yes?
C: WALSH
D: They took the van.
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: And?
C: WALSH
D: And they blew up the bags, sir.
E: V.O. hesitantly, this is bad news
C: BENEDICT
D: Shit.
E: dropping his walkie- talkie to his side
C: WALSH
D: Sir... sir...
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: What, Walsh?
C: WALSH
D: They say it doesn't look like there was any money in the bags, sir.
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: What?!
C: WALSH
D: They say the bags were filled with fliers. For hookers.
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: What do you mean there was no money in the bags?
C: WALSH
D: That's what they said, sir. I don't understand it: we both saw them putting money inside those bags.
E: V.O.
N: Benedict stops cold. He stares up at a wall where an engraved sign reading "Bellagio" has been smoke-stained.
C: BENEDICT
D: Walsh, cue up the tape of the robbery.
S: INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY
N: Walsh stands before several monitors as Slim cues up the "masked men robbing the vault" image of a few minutes ago beside the present image of Benedict staring at the vault wall.
C: BENEDICT
D: Does it say 'Bellagio' on the south wall of the vault?
E: V.O.
N: In the masked-men image it does not, in fact, say "Bellagio" there.
C: WALSH
D: No, sir. It doesn't. I -- I don't understand...
E: on walkie-talkie
S: INT. VAULT
N: Benedict exhales.
C: BENEDICT
D: We had that installed on Tuesday. The image we saw of the men robbing us was a tape.
C: WALSH
D: What?
E: V.O.
C: BENEDICT
D: Someone built a double of my vault, then made a tape of them robbing it. When we saw them putting money in those bags, that wasn't actually happening.
S: INT. SECURITY CENTER
N: Walsh's jaw drops as he watches the tape again.
C: WALSH
D: Then, sir...
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 140.
S: INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT
N: Benedict is absolutely fucking furious.

S: INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - CLOSE ON SWAT DUFFEL BAG - NIGHT
N: carried through the Bellagio casino, held by the SWAT Leader leading his men out (now eight in all), and at last we PULL UP to see his face for the first time... It's Rusty, in full regalia, leading Livingston, Turk, Saul, Frank, Basher, Yen and Linus out of the casino, each dressed as a SWAT member, each carrying a duffel bag with nearly $20 million dollars inside. As we PASS each man, under the HUM OF the CASINO, we see:
S: FLASHBACK - INT. MIRADOR SUITE - LIVINGSTON
N: takes the call from Walsh in the Mirador suite as Basher, Saul, and Frank dress behind him.
C: LIVINGSTON
D: 9-1-1. Emergency response.
N: TURK dressed as a SWAT member, hustles down a cage corridor. SAUL has trouble rappelling with the rest. BASHER takes position next to Rusty at the elevator shaft's bottom. They're on-camera, but just a few feet away and (off-camera) Danny sits smiling.
C: RUSTY
D: Prepare to cut power!
E: hiding his voice
N: YEN lights a short fuse leading into the vault... OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 4/16/01 141. LINUS feigns hysteria...
C: LINUS
D: Guys, someone's here!
N: RUSTY FIRES a SPURT of BLANKS. BARRROOOOM! No one is hurt. Nor is the money, stacked neatly in a corridor, ready to be packed into the phony SWAT team bags, body armor, etc.
S: EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: The SWAT team exits and boards the second vehicle Turk and Virgil have been working on all this time, the one in the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from its rearview mirror: it's a replica of a SWAT van. Turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back. Rusty flips open another cell phone...
C: RUSTY
D: Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer Brooks, New Jersey Probation Division. I have a violator in your jurisdiction... Hit it.
E: cupping phone
N: Turk hits the gas and the VEHICLE PEELS away, carrying its cadre of new multi-millionaires far away from the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.
S: INT. BELLAGIO VAULT
N: Benedict squats down to inspect a burnt scrap of paper on the vault floor. It's a flier for a strip joint.
C: BENEDICT
D: Ocean...
E: and it finally occurs to him
S: INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - MOVING WITH BENEDICT
N: Heated, he approaches the interrogation room, where his Plainclothes Goons keep watch. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 4/16/01 141A. CONTINUED: (A1)
C: BENEDICT
D: Where's Ocean?
N: PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1 Still inside, sir. With Bruiser. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 142. Benedict straightens his cuffs, cools himself, then:
C: BENEDICT
D: Open that door.
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
N: Bruiser throws a mean left hook across Danny's face as the door swings open and Benedict steps in. Bruiser sees him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles. Benedict studies Danny: the man is a bloody mess, head rolling, eyes puffed up.
C: BENEDICT
D: Wake him up.
N: The Goons step in, slap Danny alert. At last, Danny recognizes Benedict in the room.
C: DANNY
D: Heya, Benedict... How's the other fight going?
E: a little punchy
N: Benedict keeps his cool.
C: BENEDICT
D: Did you have a hand in this? Did you?
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: Did I have a hand in what?
N: Benedict scrutinizes Danny: Is he bluffing? He looks at Bruiser, then Danny again, and decides: no.
C: BENEDICT
D: Get him out of here.
N: As the Goons scoop him up and drag him out, Danny catches Bruiser's eye for just a moment. And barely winks.
S: INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE
N: The PHONE RINGS. Tess plucks it up.
C: TESS
D: Hello?
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 143.

D: Turn to Channel 88.
E: V.O. if you must know, it's Livingston's
N: CLICK. Tess does so. On her TV: A security-angle of the cage hallway. The Goons appear, escorting bloodied Danny out. As Tess gasps, we go live to...
S: INT. CAGE/HALLWAY
N: Where Benedict follows the Goons and Danny out, brooding: what's his next step? Walsh approaches.
C: DANNY
D: You get robbed or something, Benedict? Geez, that's a shame.
N: Benedict looks up, suspicious.
C: BENEDICT
D: Stop there.
N: The Goons stop, spin Danny around to face Benedict.
C: BENEDICT
D: Where. Is. My. Money.
N: They hold each other's eye.
C: DANNY
D: What would you say if I told you you could get your money back... ... if you gave up Tess? What would you say?
E: beat beat
C: BENEDICT
D: I would say yes.
S: INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE
N: She's crestfallen. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 144.

C: DANNY
D: Well, that's very interesting... ... but I didn't have anything to do with it.
E: beat
N: He grins. Benedict sinks.
C: BENEDICT
D: Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit. And contact the police. I would imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation of his parole.
E: to his Goons

D: No. Follow him. Everywhere.
S: INT. CASINO FLOOR - OUTSIDE CAGES
N: Benedict exits. Takes in his casino. It's been a bad night: he's down a hundred fifty million. He starts for...
S: INT. CASINO FLOOR - ELEVATOR BAY
N: As he arrives, the elevator doors open and Tess steps out. She breezes right past him.
C: BENEDICT
D: Tess... Tess?
E: as she doesn't stop
C: TESS
D: You of all people should know, Terry: in your hotel, there's always someone watching.
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 145. She keeps going. Benedict, now down a hundred fifty million and one woman, boards the elevator. Its doors close on him.
S: EXT. ALLEY/VACANT WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING
N: The SWAT van rounds a corner and ducks inside the warehouse. Three-and-a-half seconds pass. And the eight SWAT members reappear, now all in suits, perfectly pressed, and with grins on their faces and change in their pockets, they begin their victory stroll, single-file and sloppy... right down the... STRIP - MOVING WITH THEM Turk, Livingston, Frank, Basher, Yen, Saul, Linus and Rusty march down the strip single-file, and when they come to an intersection... ... Virgil and Reuben, also in suits, fall into stride for a victory lap in front of the Bellagio fountains. Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into different hotels or grabbing cabs, until there are only two left: Rusty and Linus. They take each other in, shake hands, and part.
S: EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT
N: Tess exits, searching for Danny. She rounds the building to...
S: EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE
N: Where a LVPD squad car has just arrived to take goon-held Danny away. She runs toward it.
C: TESS
D: Wait!
N: They do. As Danny is handcuffed and prepared for loading in the back, he and Tess hold each other's glance. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 145A.

C: DANNY
D: I knew what I was doing.
N: A beat.

C: TESS
D: How long will you be?
C: DANNY
D: Three to six months, I should think.
E: shrug
N: The squad car door closes him in and Tess stands vigil as it pulls away. ACROSS STREET Rusty watches Danny being driven back to prison, too.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FRONT GATE - MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - DAY
N: SUPERIMPOSE: THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER. The great metal gate opens once more, revealing Danny Ocean in its frame again, ready for release. He looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the view of New Jersey looks no brighter than it did before. He takes his first step into free America... ... to discover Rusty leaning against the prison wall. Beyond him sits his second-hand Mercedes from L.A.
C: RUSTY
D: Looking for someone?
C: DANNY
D: Thirteen million and you drive that piece of shit cross country to pick me up?
C: RUSTY
D: Hello to you, too.

D: Life... is a roomful of pillows. C'mon...

N: MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together again.
C: RUSTY
D: Where do you want to go first?
C: DANNY
D: To a phone.
N: Rusty had anticipated this.
C: RUSTY
D: I stopped and picked up your personal effects, put them in the back seat.
C: DANNY
D: My what?
N: Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see Tess sitting in the back. She smiles at him.
C: DANNY
D: I'm not sure these belong to me.
E: smiling back, then
C: TESS
D: Sure they do.
N: Danny and Rusty get in. Danny kisses Tess. Rusty STARTS the CAR.
C: DANNY
D: We need to find Rusty a girl.
C: RUSTY
D: There's a women's prison just down the road...
N: OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 148. He drives off. In the back, Danny takes Tess's hand in his. Notices a silver wedding band on it.
C: DANNY
D: You said you sold this.
C: TESS
D: That's what I said.
C: DANNY
D: Liar.
C: TESS
D: Thief.
N: As they drive away... ... another car STARTS its ENGINE begins to follow. At the wheel: Benedict's goons. THE END
