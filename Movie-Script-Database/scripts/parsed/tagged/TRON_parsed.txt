M: THE ELECTRONIC WORLD
N: On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice speaking.
C: VOICE
D: As astonishing advances in computer science are made, artificial intelligence programs are being designed to assist us in every area of life...
N: We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular, wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.
C: VOICE
D: In a world-wide network of electronics, they travel through miles of circuitry at the speed of light. We created them to calculate and research, to help us design and heal and think. With all that they can do, are they only electrical impulses... or are they a new form of life?
E: CONT.
N: The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it. As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light, a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of the screen in huge letters. T R O N ! ! The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as if it had an inner core of electricity. The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD. The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the electronic information in our computers, television sets and telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs, data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through the window of television screens.
T: CUT TO:
N: CYCLE GAME TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely encasing them.
T: CUT TO:
N: LONG SHOT as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the other.
T: CUT TO:
N: REAL WORLD Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles, as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear. THE REAL WORLD We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light, their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR electronic beeping and popping. ELECTRONIC WORLD Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound like a crack of lightning. REAL WORLD A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D maze. 8/9 OMITTED 8/9 ELECTRONIC WORLD Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines. REAL WORLD A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character' throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring down, LAUGHING. ELECTRONIC WORLD Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy at each other. ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing yellow. CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT fearful, nervous, poised on one ring. SARK sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet back with violent force. 16A THE SMALLER WARRIOR 16A desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate face as he falls to instant death. SARK triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words: "WINNER: BLUE - SARK!!"
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that time.
E: distant, echoing
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: REAL WORLD - THE VIDEO ARCADE We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM." BOY Lemme play you again?
C: TEENAGE GIRL
E: holds out a hand
N: Yeah, if you've got another quarter. FOCUS ON SCREEN, ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY AND
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ELECTRONIC WORLD Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as Sark comes in and one of them calls out: WARRIOR 1 Sark, my man! You are hot! WARRIOR 2 That knuckleball gets 'em every time, boy... Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge, removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of satisfaction. The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is hidden from view.
S: INT. CYLINDER - SARK'S POV
N: of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features, appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.
C: VOICE
D: You're getting brutal, Sark. Brutal and needlessly sadistic.
E: MCP
N: The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like a drug addict, eyes glazed.
C: SARK
D: Thank. you, Master Control.
C: MCP
D: We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
C: SARK
D: Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
C: MCP
D: Strategic Air Command.
N: SARK (impressed) Nice. The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to: A CORRIDOR BENEATH THE GAME GRID long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..
C: CAPTIVE
D: Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just a compound interest program, I work at a savings and loan. I can't play in these video games...
E: CROM
C: GUARD
D: Sure you can, pal. You're a natural athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...
C: CROM
D: Are you kidding? Me? I run out to check an the T-Bill rates, I get out of breath. Hey, really...you're gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson, really mad. He's a full branch manager...
C: GUARD
D: Great, another religious nut.
E: rolls his eyes
N: They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.
S: INT. CELL
N: as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door, an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows, we can see the back of another captive program, and through the other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:
C: PROGRAM
D: Welcome to luxury living.
E: RAM
N: The new captive looks up, nervous.
C: CROM
D: Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know what I'm doing here.
N: RAM You believe in the Users?
C: CROM
D: Sure, if I don't have a User, then who wrote me?
C: RAM
D: That's what you're doing here. Master Control Program's been snapping up all us programs who believe...if he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger... an' if he can't use you, he sends you down here to the Game Grid to get the bits blasted outta you. What's your name?
C: CROM
D: Crom.
N: RAM I'm Ram. They'll train you for the games, but ... well, I hope you make it okay. Hey, what's going on in the other sectors? I've been stuck in this Grid for 200 microcycles. He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.
C: CROM
D: It's murder out there. You can't even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that Master Control creep. Hauling me down here to play games...who does he calculate he is?
N: (holds his head in his hands) If only Tron was still around... He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange, still expression on his face.
C: CROM
D: You ever see that guy in action? Hundred-percent independent. MCP couldn't tell him what to --
N: He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.
C: CROM
D: What's wrong? What did I say?
E: continuing
N: There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE FIGURE AT THE WINDOW It turns slowly, silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor. CLOSE UP - CROM reacting. He GASPS and stares.
C: CROM
D: Oh my User...Tron--they've got you in here?
N: SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring.
C: TRON
D: Not for long, friend.
T: CUT TO:
S: ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR
N: OFF IN THE SYSTEM Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along one of the paths.
S: INT. TANK
N: A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck driver on an all-night run.
C: CLU
D: Think we can merge into this mem'ry okay, good buddy?
N: A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as it speaks.
C: BIT
D: 10-4!
E: eagerly
N: As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light.
C: CLU
D: Now, ol' Flynn said to look over in here ...
S: 28A EXT. TANK 28A
N: The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.
S: 28B INT. TANK 28B
C: CLU
D: ...but I don't see what he's looking for. I'd better get over to that input/output tower and let him know.
N: 28C ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER 28C at the instrument panel.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: REAL WORLD - INT. A DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT
N: A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of large video parlor game consoles.
C: FLYNN
D: Come on, you scuzzy little data, be in there...
N: A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive, charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye.
C: FLYNN
D: I've got such nice blue paper to print you out on, if you'll just sit still...
N: WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of the CRT screen reflected there.
T: CUT TO:
S: ELECTRONIC WORLD--EXT TANK
N: The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing "tower" -- an input/output component.
S: INTERIOR TANK
N: A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next to his head.
C: CLU
D: Uh oh...we got company.
C: BIT
D: No!
E: coming into shape again, but red this time
C: CLU
D: You said it ... one of those Recognizers comes after me, gonna hafta jump clear out of the data stream.
T: CUT TO:
S: REAL WORLD - INT. FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT
N: We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the keys.
S: ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. OF TANK
N: We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form, U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes-- a recognizer. It hovers above the ground. LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE A second Reco is coming up behind the first.
S: INT. OF TANK
C: CLU
D: Oh my...the long arm o' the law.
E: in dismay
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LONG SHOT THE TANK
N: FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley. The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction. CLOSE SHOT - TURRET Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away from the tank, fast. LONG SHOT A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape. CLU running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it. CLOSE UP - CLU'S FACE reacting in fear, looking up as the screen GOES TO BLACK.
T: CUT TO:
N: REAL WORLD INTERIOR, FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT SHOT OF THE SCREEN. A complex set of programming figures ends abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen over and over, gradually filling it completely. SHOT FROM THE SIDE Flynn. FLYNN Ah, hell...busted again. He tries clearing the monitor, but the repeating line just comes right back, monotonously moving across the screen. SHOT OF THE SCREEN - HOLD as we:
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly, torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP. Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.
C: GUARD
D: Got a pirate program here... says his name's Clu.
N: The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling a suspect.
C: MCP
D: What'd he pull?
C: GUARD
D: Came into the system with a stolen password ... an' we caught him tryin' to raid a high-clearance memory.
C: CLU
D: No...I must've gotten in there by mistake, I -
E: looks up, his face wracked with pain
N: The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets momentarily becomes unbearable.
C: MCP
D: Who programmed you?
N: The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.
C: MCP
D: You're in trouble, pal...big trouble. But if you tell us who put you up to it, you could make it easy on yourself. Come on, who's your user?
E: CONT.
C: CLU
D: Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty Master Control ... you're not makin' me talk.
C: MCP
D: Suit yourself ...
N: The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into electric static.
C: MCP
D: Get me Dillinger.
T: CUT TO:
S: THE REAL WORLD - EXT. CITY GRID - NIGHT - POV FROM
N: HELICOPTER We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:
C: DILLINGER
D: Hello?
E: O.S.
C: A SECRETARIAL VOICE
D: Mr. Dillinger?
E: O.S.
C: DILLINGER'S VOICE
D: Yes.
E: O.S.
C: A SECRETARIAL VOICE
D: Hello, please hold a moment for the Master Control Program
E: O.S.
N: As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and a passenger.
S: EXT. SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING
C: PILOT'S VOICE
D: will you be around for a while, or are you going right back out?
C: DILLINGER'S VOICE
D: Oh, I'll stick around a few days ... got some things to take care of.
N: THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine. In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology. 48/49 OMITTED 48/49
S: EXT. OF THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
N: We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.
S: EXT. THE HELIPORT - NIGHT
N: on top of the building. Several technicians are at hand, and as the helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it. 52-57 OMITTED 52-57
S: INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
N: A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see printed out on the screen: REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger. Password: MASTER. The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.
C: MCP
D: Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.
N: Dillinger settles into a chair.
C: DILLINGER
D: No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up?
E: shrugs
C: MCP
D: It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
C: DILLINGER
D: Flynn?
C: MCP
D: Yes. It felt like Flynn.
C: DILLINGER
D: He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
C: MCP
D: I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
C: DILLINGER
D: Meanwhile, he might find it.
C: MCP
D: I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
C: DILLINGER
D: I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
C: MCP
D: There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
C: DILLINGER
D: Cute.
C: MCP
D: End of line.
N: Dillinger watches as the computer screen wipes blank.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT of a very messy desk, with a coffee cup and half an egg salad sandwich lying on top of the computer console, with fingers visible typing on the keyboard. FULL SHOT of ALAN BAILEY blearily looking at the screen; he's a serious- looking man in his early thirties, wearing wire-rimmed glasses, and he looks like he hasn't slept for a week. On top of the terminal is a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is a small sign reading, "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto!" Alan types into the touch keyboard:
C: SCREEN
D: REQUEST: access to the TRON program, User code 717 - Bailey. Password: FREEDOM.
N: He starts to type again, but the screen clears and:
C: SCREEN ADDRESS FILE EMPTY.
D: TRON PROGRAM UNAVAILABLE.
C: ALAN
D: Huh...
E: surprised
N: He pushes his chair back, leaves his office. 61-65 OMITTED 61-65
S: INT. DILLINGER'S OFFICE
N: Dillinger opens the door, welcoming Alan.
C: DILLINGER
D: Come on in...
C: ALAN
D: Alan. Alan Bailey.
C: DILLINGER
D: Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
N: He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.
C: ALAN
D: Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
C: DILLINGER
D: oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
C: ALAN
D: Yeah...?
C: DILLINGER
D: We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.
C: ALAN
D: I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime. I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
C: DILLINGER
D: No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
C: ALAN
D: It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
C: DILLINGER
D: Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
C: ALAN
D: No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
C: DILLINGER
D: Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
C: ALAN
D: Ok
N: Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:
C: DILLINGER
D: Oh boy.
E: trouble
N: The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and through the speakers.
C: MCP
D: Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
C: DILLINGER
D: I'm sorry -
C: MCP
D: I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
E: sharply
C: DILLINGER
D: It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
E: nods
C: MCP
D: And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
C: DILLINGER
D: The Pentagon?
C: MCP
D: It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
C: DILLINGER
D: Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
C: MCP
D: I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
C: DILLINGER
D: What do you want with the Pentagon?
C: MCP
D: The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
C: DILLINGER
D: If you think -
C: MCP
D: You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
C: DILLINGER
D: You wouldn't dare.
C: MCP
D: So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
N: End of line.

S: INT. LASER RESEARCH HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: We see Alan push open the door under a sign reading "Laser Research."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LASER LAB CORRIDOR
N: Alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass WINDOW through which the laser laboratory is visible. A sign over the window, marked "Experiment in Progress," is illuminated by a red warning bulb. 71/72 OMITTED 71/72
S: INT. LASER ROOM - LONG SHOT
N: of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white- suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry- picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look at them. We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman, with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their bristling white eyebrows. In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist. Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks at the moment. As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:
C: LORA
D: Well, here goes nothing ...
E: sighs
C: GIBBS
D: Hah. Interesting, interesting. You hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."
C: LORA
D: Well, I meant -
C: GIBBS
D: Whereas actually, what we propose to do is to turn something into nothing and back again. So you might just as well have said, "Here goes something and here comes nothing." Hah?
N: They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical plat-form -- empty.
C: LORA
D: Let me make sure we're running
N: She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables. Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but close enough to watch. ANGLE - LORA She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.
C: LORA
D: Looks good...
N: GIBBS (O.S.) Let 'er rip... LASER LAB - AS BEFORE The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly, the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed, five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.
C: GIBBS
D: Perfect.
E: quietly
N: At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper shoe-covers, walking toward them.
C: ALAN
D: Beautiful!
C: GIBBS
D: Hello, Alan.
C: ALAN
D: Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
N: He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.
C: GIBBS
D: Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and... voila.
E: indicates ball
N: CONTINUED
C: ALAN
D: Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
C: GIBBS
D: Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
N: The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with their arms around each other's shoulders.
C: LORA
D: How's it going upstairs?
C: ALAN
D: Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
N: Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.
C: ALAN
D: Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
E: continuing
C: GIBBS
D: Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
C: ALAN
D: They'll start to soon enough.
C: GIBBS
D: Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
E: wryly
N: AD LIB goodnights.
S: INT. CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT
N: outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off her white suit, and Alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes.
C: LORA
D: Did you say Group 7 access?
C: ALAN
D: Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
C: LORA
D: Did he say why?
C: ALAN
D: Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
E: shrugs
C: LORA
D: Flynn had Group 7 access.
C: ALAN
D: Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
C: LORA
D: Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
C: ALAN
D: Okay, okay...
C: LORA
D: I want to go to his place.
C: ALAN
D: You call that getting over it?
C: LORA
D: I mean I want both of us to go.
N: She closes her locker. He follows her into the corridor.
S: INT. CORRIDOR
N: Alan and Lora, walking to the elevator.
C: ALAN
D: What for?
C: LORA
D: To warn him.
C: ALAN
D: Of what?
C: LORA
D: That Dillinger's on to him.
N: They get into the elevator.
C: ALAN
D: For what?
C: LORA
D: For being on to Dillinger.
C: ALAN
D: What -- ?

S: EXT. VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT
N: As van pulls up in front of it, a long ESTABLISHING SHOT with the name "Flynn's" high and blazing above the entrance.
T: CUT TO:
N: INT. VIDEO ARCADE (same arcade as in title sequence)-NIGHT CAMERA PANS AROUND. It's bright and jazzy, Las Vegas style, decorated with huge murals of computer chips and electronic circuitry. We see dozens of individual machines, where scores of GUYS and GIRLS, teenagers mostly, but older and younger kids too, are playing the games, watching, milling around, CHATTERING. As the kids play, colored glows from the video games light up their faces eerily. CLOSE SHOT of kid playing one of the games "Tailgunner."
T: CUT TO:
N: ANOTHER CLOSE UP of two GIRLS playing "Berzerk," with 2-D computer images of human figures running through the maze. CLOSE UP of "Battle Zone" screen. CLOSE UP of "'Lunar Lander". CLOSE UP of "Star Castle". CLOSE UP of "Space Invaders". CAMERA TRUCKS through the aisle, past the absorbed kids who crowd around each machine, oblivious to anyone passing them.
T: CUT TO:
N: ALAN AND LORA walking through the aisle of games, from behind. They are slightly bewildered and confused by the weird noises. Lora approaches a junior high school girl who's watching a hot game of "Battle Zone."
C: LORA
D: Hey, where's Flynn tonight?
N: The kid looks at Lora, then turns towards the center of the room and points. Alan and Lora look.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLYNN playing a game called Space Paranoids, CAMERA TILTING UP into his face, catching the orange glow from the console. The game has a prominent ICOM logo under the screen. Flynn is a cocky kid in his mid-20s, unshaven, wearing a T-shirt, jeans, jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score. Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans. As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to 999,999,999 -- then flashes the word "RECORD" as lights blink and a SIREN sounds. The kids cheer wildly.
C: FLYNN
D: It's all in the wrist, friends.
N: He grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora approaching him, with Alan in tow.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
E: continuinq
C: LORA
D: We have to talk.
C: FLYNN
D: Good luck. You can't even think in here.
N: He leads them toward the back of the arcade.
C: FLYNN
D: Come on.
E: CONT.
N: 93-96 OMIT 93-96
S: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
N: A dark, panelled room, with a few comfortable chairs, a business desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw Flynn working in scenes 29, 33, etc.), and a couple of video games -- Flynn's favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans against a game, nervous; Lora paces.
C: FLYNN
D: So...how's the world of serious science?
E: stretching his arms, relaxing
C: LORA
D: Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
C: FLYNN
D: Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
E: to Alan
N: Alan looks profoundly uncomfortable.
C: LORA
D: Flynn!
C: ALAN
D: Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
N: Flynn laughs.
C: LORA
D: You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
E: to Alan, indicating arcade
C: FLYNN
D: Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
C: ALAN
D: You did break in.
C: FLYNN
D: Tried to. Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
E: nods toward terminal
C: ALAN
D: Are you embezzling?
C: FLYNN
D: "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey... No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
E: Sydney Greenstreet normal voice
C: ALAN
D: I don't get it.
C: FLYNN
D: You haven't told him?
E: to Lora
N: She shakes her head.
C: FLYNN
D: Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... ...Space Paranoids.
E: CONT. sighs points to himself waves at one of the games in the room
C: ALAN
D: You invented Space Paranoids?
C: FLYNN
D: Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
E: gestures
C: ALAN
D: Senior exec.
C: FLYNN
D: Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
C: ALAN
D: I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
C: FLYNN
D: Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
C: FLYNN
D: My password ... Dillinger's instruction to divert the data ...
E: CONT.
C: LORA
D: I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
C: FLYNN
D: Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
C: ALAN
D: Dillinger?
C: FLYNN
D: Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
C: LORA
D: Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
C: FLYNN
D: Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
C: ALAN
D: Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
C: FLYNN
D: Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
N: They all look at each other. After a beat, Lora holds the keys to her van aloft.
C: LORA
D: Shall we dance?
T: CUT TO:
N: 98-100 OMIT 98-100 DILLINGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk. Gibbs, standing, faces him.
C: GIBBS
D: Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
C: DILLINGER
D: Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
C: GIBBS
D: That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
C: DILLINGER
D: The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
C: GIBBS
D: User requests are what computers are for.
C: DILLINGER
D: Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
N: As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board, and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth adding up, accounts receivable and assets.
C: DILLINGER
D: We're billing accounts in 30 countries, we've got one of the largest systems in existence...
E: CONT.
N: Gibbs turns wearily away from the display.
C: GIBBS
D: Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
C: DILLINGER
D: It can be arranged...
N: Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again.
C: GIBBS
D: That was uncalled-for.
C: DILLINGER
D: I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
C: GIBBS
D: Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
N: He exits.
S: EXT. ICOM BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box. 102a INT. VAN 102a A digital CLOCK on the dashboard reads 12:12. Lora is at the wheel, Alan next to her.
C: LORA
D: You better get in back with Flynn. And keep down.
N: She jerks her thumb over her shoulder.
C: ALAN
D: Do I gotta?
N: But he climbs over the seat, and Lora starts to drive slowly forward. CLOSE ON FLYNN AND ALAN
C: FLYNN
D: Hi, Alan.
C: ALAN
D: Hi, Flynn.
E: resigned
N: Flynn pulls a bag of doughnuts from his pocket.
C: FLYNN
D: My dinner.
E: explaining
C: ALAN
D: I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
C: FLYNN
D: Want one?
C: ALAN
D: Uh... got any cinnamon?
N: Flynn smiles, hands Alan a doughnut.
C: LORA'S VOICE
D: Keep it down, you guys.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. ICOM - THE GIGANTIC SECURITY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
N: Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.
C: LORA
D: I don't think I'm cleared for this.
C: ALAN
D: I'm certainly not.
C: FLYNN
D: Move aside. Let the kid have some room.
N: He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock, his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ... and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn starts LAUGHING.
S: INT. A CORRIDOR
N: The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall. But as they go past it, it swivels and aims right at them.
C: LORA
D: Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
C: FLYNN
D: Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
C: LORA
D: As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
N: POV SECURITY CAMERA A SHOT of the three backs retreating down the corridor. 107-111 OMIT 107-111
S: INT. HALLWAY AT ELEVATOR - POV OF MCP
N: from the rotating security camera outside the elevator on the floor of the laser lab. We see Flynn's face peek out and see the camera. His head pulls back in. SHOT OF HALLWAY As the security camera aims away from the-elevator, Flynn and Lora make a mad dash down the hall and we see Alan's face watching.
S: INT. DOORWAY TO LASER LAB - POV OF MCP
N: from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab. We see Flynn approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

N: Lora watches as Flynn sits down at her terminal.
C: LORA
D: This laser's my life's work. Don't spill anything.
N: Flynn LAUGHS as Lora goes out. CLOSE SHOT OF FLYNN settling in, loosening his fingers, like a concert pianist, or a safecracker. He types in a code number, presses the "enter" key. VIEW OF THE CEILING We see a camera emerging from a sliding panel. POV OF MCP from this camera. We watch as Flynn starts typing.

C: FLYNN
D: Hey hey, it's that big Master Control Program everybody's talking about... You don't look a thing like your pictures... Tell me, have you really been thinking about world domination like they say? CODE SERIES LSU-123 ... activate. CODE SERIES ESS-999 ... activate. CODE SERIES HHH-888 ... activate.
E: types.
C: MCP
D: That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn. I'm afraid you...
N: The voice lurches, goes into high speed, and then back to normal.
C: MCP
D: Stop, Flynn. You realize I can't allow this.
E: continuing; slightly shaken
N: SHOT OF LASER EQUIPMENT activating, lighting up. SHOT OF FLYNN AT-TERMINAL We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice. We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it is this section that is being activated.

C: MCP
D: You're entering a big error, Flynn... I'm going to have to put you on the Game Grid.
C: FLYNN
D: Games, huh? I'll give you --
N: Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light, being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic - with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one we saw at the opening of the film'. The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo, covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures, angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with an internal energy. We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs, and then we're right over this area and diving straight down, everything blurring with the speed.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ELECTRONIC WORLD - A TUNNEL made up of rings of energy, and we are diving straight down it.
T: CUT TO:
N: THIS TUNNEL We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops, staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.
T: CUT TO:
N: SHOT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL We see Flynn, or what looks like Flynn -- same face, etc, but now covered with a strange costume, made of electronic circuitry, glowing with energy. Flynn shakes his head dazedly.
C: FLYNN
D: Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only thinks it's happening...
N: He looks up and SEES something. FLYNN'S POV A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff, is right in front of him. This character reaches out an arm and grabs Flynn.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLYNN being dragged off the entry tube platform.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is about those parking tickets, I can explain everything...
N: THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER hovering over the Game Grid. We see Sark in his feet sockets, his hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the cylinder of the MCP.
C: MCP
D: SARK, ES-1117821. Open communication.
N: Sark suddenly snaps to awareness, directing all his attention to the MCP.
C: SARK
D: Yes, MCP.
E: hoarsely
C: MCP
D: I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
C: SARK
D: You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
C: MCP
D: He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
N: Sark looks up, shocked.
C: SARK
D: A User?
C: MCP
D: That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
C: SARK
D: Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
C: MCP
D: Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
E: disgust
C: SARK
D: But-what if I can't...?
C: MCP
D: You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
N: The circuits going into the energy sockets fade; we see Sark weaken.
C: SARK
D: Wait...I need that...
C: MCP
D: Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
N: Acknowledge.
C: SARK
D: Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
E: weakly

N: The hologram disappears and Sark's power returns.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CORRIDOR BENEATH GAME GRID
N: Two guards leading Flynn down it, ECHOING FOOTSTEPS. They turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a cell. The door opens automatically. Flynn holds back.
C: GUARD
D: Video Game Unit #18. In here, program.
C: FLYNN
D: Who you callin' "program," program?
E: trying to grab the guard's arm
N: The guard shoves Flynn inside and SLAMS the door, cutting off his voice.
S: INT. CELL
N: The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence. Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands. HIS POV Flynn's hands are glowing, electrified. CLOSE SHOT of his face. His head comes up and we see an expression of terrible understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening of the neighboring cell.
S: INT. NEXT CELL - RAM'S
N: Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's.
C: RAM
D: New guy...
E: looking over his shoulder
C: TRON
D: Another free program off line. What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
E: shakes his head
C: RAM
D: The Users...you really think they're still there?
E: sighs
C: TRON
D: They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
N: FLYNN'S CELL He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back, so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey! Who are you guys? What's the story around here?
N: But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells, it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock. RAM turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.
C: RAM
D: You want to watch those force fields...
N: He goes to the window opening.
C: RAM
D: You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
E: CONT.
C: FLYNN
D: Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
C: RAM
D: You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
C: FLYNN
D: Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
E: relieved
N: Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything, there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell opens. THE CORRIDOR we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the opposite direction.
T: CUT TO:
N: TRAINING ARENA A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of them. Flynn is in the front of the line.
C: HEAD GUARD
D: Look operative, you guys. Command Program Sark will explain the training procedures.

E: nods
N: The POUNDING on Flynn's cell begins again. THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous, frightened of this new User-warrior.
C: SARK
D: Wait a minute...put this guy against one of the other recruits.
E: over his shoulder
N: OMIT A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other. When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear. We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He looks over at Crom, who's anxious.
C: FLYNN
D: Looks like we're in the same boat here -
C: CROM
D: You think you're gonna wipe me right out, don't you?
E: jumpy
C: FLYNN
D: No, I
N: A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads straight for Flynn. Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches himself in time to keep from falling over the edge. FLYNN'S POV - DOWN down, down between the rings into an infinite pit. BACK TO FLYNN staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up. HIS POV Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey!
N: FLYNN reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back. CROM Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains, but misses. One of his rings disappears. FLYNN reacting
C: FLYNN
D: Okay!
E: happy he's scored
N: SARK'S AIRCRAFT CARRIER - THE BRIDGE High above the game we see Sark watching. FLYNN racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again. We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast. OMIT THE GAME IN PROGRESS
C: FLYNN
D: Here's an easy one...
N: Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of the next ring to keep from falling. 200-201 OMIT 200-201 FLYNN He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring. SARK His face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid... angry FLYNN He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above. Flynn looks up. There, appearing in the mirror disk above, is Sark's face, furious, huge.

D: No!
N: SARK'S HUGE REFLECTED IMAGE in the mirror platform, towering above Flynn.
C: SARK
D: You'll regret this.
N: SARK'S FINGER pressing a button. CROM The ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a SCREAM, he falls... and falls ... and falls... SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN with Flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of Sark above him. SARK on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.
C: SARK
D: No! You said he could die in the games
E: looking up
N: FLYNN staring up. The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves. SARK He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER SOUNDS. FLYNN as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting to run across to him. RAM AND TRON The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells. They look up. A CORRIDOR IN THE GAME AREA Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by and deliberately brush into Flynn.
C: WARRIOR
D: Outta my way, rookie.
E: turning on Flynn, snarling
N: Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back and pulls out his disk.
C: FLYNN
D: Out of my way, zero bit.
N: He moves as if to throw the disk.
C: WARRIOR
D: Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.
E: backing away
N: The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as Flynn and his guards continue on. THE HOLDING AREA FOR THE LIGHT CYCLE GAME Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another corridor. Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.
C: RAM
D: Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
C: FLYNN
D: Tron...?
E: under his breath
N: He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.
C: FLYNN
D: Alan!
C: TRON
D: Where did you hear that name?
E: frowning
C: FLYNN
D: Well, isn't it -- ?
C: TRON
D: The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
C: FLYNN
D: I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
E: thinking fast
C: RAM
D: He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
C: FLYNN
D: Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
N: Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.
T: CUT TO:
N: LONG SHOT OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena. ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start. A SHOT FROM ABOVE The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier hovering high overhead. CLOSE ON TRON
C: TRON
D: That's what my User wants, too...
N: SHOT OF THE THREE FRIENDS holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.
C: FLYNN
D: I know...
N: CLOSE SHOT - FLYNN With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed around him. SHOT OF THE THREE BLUE CYCLES ready to go. SHOT OF THE THREE CONSCRIPT CYCLES also ready. SARK His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again. SHOT FROM ABOVE OF ALL CYCLES TAKING OFF We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other: OMIT TRON'S POV of the other cycle heading straight at him. SHOT FROM ABOVE We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the arena.
C: FLYNN'S VOICE
D: Nice one!
E: into mike
N: SHOT OF TRON AND HIS OPPONENT They start making turns, passing walls they have already created, each trying to box the other in.
C: TRON'S VOICE
D: Ram, stay all the way over ...
E: into mike
N: CLOSE SHOT FROM THE SIDE - TRON rushing forward. SHOT OF THE CYCLES turning.
C: RAM'S VOICE
D: I've got control. Go ahead.
E: into mike
N: SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF TRON'S CYCLE SHOT FROM ABOVE They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall. There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
T: dissolve as he does.
N: SHOT OF FLYNN rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn. CLOSE UP OF FLYNN LONG SHOT They make another turn SHOT OF TWO CYCLES RUSHING right at the camera. FLYNN'S POV of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack in the bulwark. CLOSE UP - HIS FACE reacting, getting an idea.
C: FLYNN
D: You guys...follow me.
E: into mike
N: SHOT OF THE TWO CYCLES racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack. SARK observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User. FLYNN He races straight at the crack... and through it. SARK His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console in front of him. LONG SHOT OF THE GRID The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena. CLOSE UP - TRON reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes. ANGLE ON RAM SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns and races up next to Tron. SHOT OF THEM side by side. They look at each other.
C: RAM
D: What do you think?
E: into mike
C: TRON
D: Do it!
E: into mike
N: LONG SHOT We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:
C: VOICE
D: WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID. REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.
E: through loudspeaker
N: We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies out altogether. SHOT OF TWO RECOGNIZERS moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it. SHOT OF THE THREE ESCAPING CYCLES racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA... SARK He is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out of his way.
C: SARK
D: Get them. Send out every Game Tank in the Grid! Get them!
N: SHOT FROM BELOW FLYNN as he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about to come down for the kill.
C: FLYNN
D: Watch it!
E: into mike
C: RAM
D: Recognizers!
E: into mike
N: 252A SHOT OF RAM 252 heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage." SHOT FROM BEHIND as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked, way too big to fit through the opening.
S: INT. WEAPONS STORAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS
N: FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes, and follow.
S: EXT. MAZE
N: Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the face of the cliff. They stop for a moment. 255A ANGLE ON FLYNN 255A CLOSE UP - TRON'S FACE listening.
C: TRON
D: Game Tanks! Come on
E: into mike
N: SHOT FROM ABOVE as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing from view.
S: INT. OF THE CAVE
N: We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.
C: FLYNN
D: Oh man...when you're on the other side of the screen...it all looks so easy...
N: Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and grinning, until all three are LAUGHING. DESERT LABYRINTH as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft carrier hovering overhead. BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.
C: SARK
D: Get the pursuit force back into 404A. There's no place else they could be...
E: to one of the bridge personnel
N: Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark, where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible, moving through it. He turns to Sark.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: We'll have them in no time, sir. Long before the interrupt interface.
E: confidently
C: SARK
D: We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone. I want those programs!
E: whirls on him
S: INT. CAVE
N: Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.
C: FLYNN
D: It's all circuits... Must be an input/output component...
E: looking out points at tower
C: RAM
D: The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
C: FLYNN
D: Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
E: sitting down against a rock
C: RAM
D: PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ... ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
E: sits also starts counting them off on his fingers
C: FLYNN
D: It grows on you.
E: shrugs
N: He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is gazing upwards.
C: TRON
D: I can feel it ...
E: murmuring
N: Flynn and Ram turn.
C: FLYNN
D: Feel what? You okay?
C: RAM
D: Alan-One...
C: TRON
D: Yes... he's got something to tell me...
N: Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.
C: RAM
D: You think we can make it there?
C: TRON
D: We have to.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey, what's that?
E: pointing to a corner of the cave
N: They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream can just be seen. Ram gets up.
C: RAM
D: it's just what we need.
S: INT. NICHE
N: Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing, brilliant LIGHT.
C: TRON
D: Oh, that's nice. You always forget how good fresh energy feels, till you get to a pure source... Have some...you'll need it.
E: to Flynn
N: Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.
C: FLYNN
D: well... when do we pay a call on the ol' Master Control?
E: wiping his mouth
N: Tron and Ram are taken aback.
C: TRON
D: What, just the three of us?
C: FLYNN
D: You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
E: shrugs
C: RAM
D: Do you know what he's talking about?
E: to Tron
C: TRON
D: I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
E: to Flynn
C: FLYNN
D: Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows what to -
N: Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.
C: FLYNN
D: What's that?
E: CONT.
C: TRON
D: Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
N: With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back into shape and race up the ramp, and on out. 263-265 OMIT 263-265
S: EXT. CAVE
N: The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible avenues of escape in the terrain below.
C: FLYNN
D: How about over there...that empty memory?
E: points
C: TRON
D: No good...they might block off the old chip. This way.
E: shakes head points
N: The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind. POV OF A GUN SIGHT from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow arroyo. SHOT OF THE CYCLES They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come to the edge of a gaping ravine. Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.
C: TRON'S VOICE
D: The bridge! Come on!
N: The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons, lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank turning the corner.
T: CUT TO:
N: POV OF TANK GUNSIGHT as the turret swings around and focuses on the bridge. SHOT OF THE BRIDGE Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears, and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around. He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble. The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again, speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.
T: CUT TO:
N: 271-272 OMIT 271-272 FLYNN AND RAM Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet, sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him up. SHOT OF FLYNN struggling with Ram's limp body, wedging himself into a narrow crack.
T: CUT TO:
N: SARK in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.
C: SARK
D: Make contact with master Control... he'll be pleased to hear we're all finished with that User he sent us.
E: to lieutenant smiles
S: EXT. DESERT - TRON'S CYCLE
N: speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for the cityscape tower in the distance. SHOT IN FRONT OF HIM - HIS FACE Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously moving in his direction.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLYNN AND RAM Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is getting darker.
C: FLYNN
D: You gonna make it?
N: Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert, leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLYNN arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening. Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLYNN AND RAM sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.
T: FADE TO BLACK: FADE UP FROM BLACK
N: Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone. Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and RUMBLE.
C: FLYNN
D: What's goin' on?
E: holding onto the wall
C: RAM
D: We're inside a Recognizer... You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
E: looking around, weak to Flynn
C: FLYNN
D: Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
E: stumbling, trying to keep his balance
N: Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright position.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHOT OF THE RECOGNIZER
N: as it stands up, covered with a static overlay, partially de-rezzed.
S: INT. RECOGNIZER
N: Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below. Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's going fast.
C: FLYNN
D: You okay? You don't look so good.
N: Ram nods weakly.
C: FLYNN
D: Hang on. We'll get you outta here.
E: CONT.
N: Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with no result.
C: FLYNN
D: Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
E: CONT.
C: RAM
D: Come here.
N: Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey... !
C: RAM
D: Little more juice's all it needs...
N: Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes. Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow, but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE CITY LANDSCAPE Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a NOISE from above, and Tron looks up. TRON'S POV A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.
S: EXT. CITY LANDSCAPE
N: He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the figure, dissolving it. CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving. Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his head sadly, but walks on. TRON TURNS A CORNER Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building. CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side, figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the building stand a small group of the memory guards.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CITY - LONG SHOT
N: of the city, and the tower and beam rising high into the air, with Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CITY - LONGER SHOT
N: over the complex landscape, of the distant city and tower, with Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RECOGNIZER - FLYNN
N: This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs, then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another. One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer gives a violent shake, then stops.
C: FLYNN
D: Never gonna figure out how to work this thing...
N: There's a NOISE from above. He looks up. HIS POV We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment. FLYNN His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending to be still examining things.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE GLOW Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying to get a look at Flynn. The BIT. WIDE SHOT Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.
C: FLYNN
D: Okay -- hold it right there!
N: The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:
C: BIT
D: Yes!
N: The Bit subsides into energy form again.
C: FLYNN
D: What do you mean, "'yes"?
E: still suspicious
C: BIT
D: Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
N: From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character, red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.
C: FLYNN
D: That all you can say?
C: BIT
D: No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
E: of course not, you know better
C: FLYNN
D: Oh. Anything else?
C: BIT
D: Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
C: FLYNN
D: only yes and no... You're a bit.
E: it dawns
C: BIT
D: For sure...
E: hippie
C: FLYNN
D: where's your program? Won't it miss you?
C: BIT
D: No...
E: confused
N: Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.
C: FLYNN
D: I'm your program?
C: BIT
D: Right on the money!
E: emphatic
C: FLYNN
D: Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
E: sighs
N: In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows, stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and grabs the cross-bar.
C: FLYNN
D: Like so?
E: CONT.
N: Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer, and it takes off like a bat out of hell 297-298 OMIT 297-298
S: EXT. RECOGNIZER
N: heading for the city. It lurches forward unevenly, crashing drunkenly into a wall and bouncing off another one.
S: INT. RECOGNIZER
C: FLYNN
D: Way to go! We're haulin'!
C: BIT
D: Yes, okay, exactement!
N: 301-302 OMIT 301-302
S: INT. SIMULATION HANGER COMPLEX
N: This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces. We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along. Tron looks farther down the corridor.
T: CUT TO:
N: HIS POV We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards Tron.
T: CUT TO:
N: TRON as he moves back against the wall, into a niche. As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him. The line of workers mechanically files on past. We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly, half-heartedly.
C: TRON
D: I'm not gonna hurt you.
N: She stops struggling.
C: TRON
D: I'm going to let you go now... don't scream, or I'll be very sorry.
E: CONT.
N: His hands loosen, and he releases her.
T: CUT TO:
N: SHOT FROM IN FRONT We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face, still beautiful in its pallor.
C: TRON
D: Put your hand behind your back.
N: Slowly she obeys. CLOSE UP - TRON A slow smile appears on his face. SHOT OF THEM BOTH He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.
C: GIRL
D: TRON!!
N: She throws her arms around him.
C: TRON
D: Yori... hey...
E: smiling, hugging her tightly
C: YORI
D: Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
N: She-looks around nervously.
C: YORI
D: This way. Come on.
E: pulling him by his hand
N: They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE STREETS Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings, and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they hear snatches of conversation.
C: PROGRAM
D: ...artillery for Video Game Sector...
N: PROGRAM 2 ...all mathematical functions transferred to...
C: YORI
D: I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
C: TRON
D: That's all going to change, Yori...
C: YORI
D: How?
C: TRON
D: Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
N: Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SKY - HER POV
N: as she looks up. Recognizer.
T: CUT TO:
N: YORI She shivers, and holds Tron's hand tighter.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. YORI'S BUILDING - LONG SHOT
N: Tron and Yori arrive at the ground level entrance.
S: INT. HALLWAYS
N: Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door. She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. YORI'S APARTMENT
N: As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the walls and floors.
C: YORI
D: My quarters.
C: TRON
D: Why is everything...like this?
C: YORI
D: It's a flat. But wait a micro...
N: She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around; the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops. HIS POV With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.
C: YORI
D: Come here.
N: TRON His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is being fully rewarded for his efforts.
C: TRON
D: You're beautiful, Yori.
N: SHOT OF THEM BOTH as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their flattened palms. Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.
C: YORI
D: You've grown, big program.
C: TRON
D: I had to...in the games...
N: They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and are enveloped in the cloud of stars...
T: SLOW, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER
N: hovering in the air above the factory city, moving slowly forward. ZOOM OUT past the carrier towards the landscape beyond.
T: CUT TO:

N: He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts shouting:
C: BIT
D: Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -
N: Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.
C: BIT
D: Right, confirmed, I couldn't have put it -
E: that's more like it
T: CUT TO
S: EXT.
N: as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it, with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air, landing in what looks like a garbage dump.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT.
N: as Flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris, the Bit nervously hovering over him.
C: FLYNN
D: Catch me listening to you again.
E: to Bit
S: EXT.
N: A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see him.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine. Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks for your concern. So long.
N: They move on.
C: FLYNN
D: This town's full o' live ones.
E: to the Bit
C: BIT
D: Not a chance.
S: EXT. CITY PLAZA
N: Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.
C: PROGRAMS
D: I have to re-route the insurance information bits... Next cycle we start the war game simulation for the MCP... Did you make that accounts receivable adjustment for Sark... Certainly... the MCP wants only minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.
S: EXT. THE BASE OF THE I/0 TOWER
N: It looms high overhead. TRON AND YORI on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower, approaching a wide door in the wall. INSIDE THIS DOOR' We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead. SHOT FROM BELOW THEM looking upwards as they move. THE UPPER FLOOR as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery, dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate, preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean, sharp, angular surfaces. On this second story there is floor and ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below and beyond. Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for a door into the inner parts of the Tower. 334-349 OMIT 334-349 THE CENTRAL CHAMBER of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar supports the first, about fifty feet up a side. In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs, from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon, each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is only blackness beyond. DUMONT'S FACE asleep. REVERSE ANGLE Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide room, their footsteps ECHOING. 353-374 OMIT 353-374 CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.
C: YORI
D: Dumont... ?
E: quietly
N: The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't recognize either one.
C: DUMONT
D: Yes?
C: TRON
D: I... have come to communicate with my User.
E: nervous
C: DUMONT
D: Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best. Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
E: indicates empty chamber
C: YORI
D: Yes...what--?
C: DUMONT
D: You know, not so long ago, you could've come in here and seen programs lined up all the way back to those doors, waiting for communion with their Users. The building fund was doing well too...but now... ...this so-called Master Control Program is going around cutting programs off from their natural creators, grabbing all our believers and making them ride around on little motor scooters and shoot things at each other and Weiner knows what all-- oh, it's enough to give you a crisis of faith...
E: sighs
C: TRON
D: Well I want to communicate --
C: DUMONT
D: Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
N: Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.
C: TRON
D: Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
C: DUMONT
D: Hah.
C: TRON
D: Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
C: DUMONT
D: When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
E: sighs
N: He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:
C: DUMONT
D: Who is your User, program?
E: CONT. falling into ritual
C: TRON
D: Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
C: DUMONT
D: All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
N: Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.
C: DUMONT
D: You may pass, my friend.
N: Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness beyond.

S: EXT. 1/0 TOWER
N: We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.
T: CUT TO:
N: A CORRIDOR IN THE TOWER. A CORNER. We see a face peer around it. Flynn.
C: FLYNN
D: This is where Tron said he was going...
N: Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going down the hall, Bit following.
C: FLYNN
D: Looks like his kind of place, too... real serious.
E: CONT.
N: CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.
T: CUT TO:
N: A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM As he stares down at the far corner. The SOUND of marching feet coming closer.
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT - MANY FEET MARCHING FAST PULL BACK AND TRUCK IN FRONT as we get a view of these characters... Sark... and a force of guards and six Blue Warriors. Sark is in front, enjoyment on his face. As far as he's concerned he's just going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is trapped.
C: GUARDS
D: Hut! Hut! hut! Hut! Hut!
T: CUT TO:
N: A SHOT OF THE CORRIDOR WHERE WE LAST SAW FLYNN as Sark and his men come around the corner. Flynn is nowhere to be seen. Sark marches TOWARDS THE CAMERA, right into it.
T: CUT TO:

D: All right!
E: V.O.
N: Flynn looks up AT THE CAMERA, finger to his lips.
T: CUT TO:
N: A SHOT FROM THE CORNER OF THE HALL We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes.
T: CUT TO:

N: surrounded by his guards. He. is looking up, eyes narrowed.
T: CUT TO:
N: A LONG SHOT FROM BEHIND HIM We see that he is standing in front of the huge, closed door to the I/0 Tower central chamber. The guards have formed two long rows, and Sark's lieutenant is standing by his side.

T: CUT TO:
N: A CLOSE SHOT LOOKING OVER SARK'S SHOULDER He turns.
C: SARK
D: Bring in the logic probe!!
N: THE HEART OF THE TOWER We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter. Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.
S: INT. COMMUNICATION BELL
N: Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat, sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks down, and then up. HIS POV The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening. FROM THE OPENING We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the knowledge of the experience to come. A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP. He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell, illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source of the light. TRON'S FACE FROM ABOVE filled with a quiet awe, eyes narrowed against the strong light. His hands drop to his sides. The disk rises out of sight, and we

N: Tron is looking upwards. Suddenly a voice booms out, echoing, and distorted, Alan's voice.
C: ALAN V.0.
D: TRON... TRON... Location query... location query... Confirm.
C: TRON
D: Confirmed, Alan-One.
C: ALAN
D: There you are... look, before we get cut off again...
E: sigh of relief
N: In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting, transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a bright light at the center. We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the others dim.
C: ALAN
D: I'm going to put some new coding on your-disk, so you can get into the memory core of the Master Control... when you get there...

D: Wait! I can't hear...
N: He stops. The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it, pulls it down and stares at it.
T: CUT TO:
N: POV - THE DISK It is glowing with a new power. Superimposed on its surface is a complex mandala pattern, changing kaleidoscopically as we watch, shifting swirling liquid color.
T: CUT TO:
N: OMIT THE DOOR Almost gone. We can hear the voices of Sark's men outside.

N: YORI turning back to Dumont. Behind Dumont stands Tron, framed in the entry to the Communication chamber. OMIT SHOT OF DUMONT He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming winglike supports for the fabric.
C: DUMONT
D: I have waited for this moment many thousands of cycles. It is time for the new order to begin... The Users are waiting.
N: As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly. Then he holds out his hand to Yori. LONG SHOT as Yori steps forward up the steps.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHAMBER - THE DOOR
N: We see it is almost transparent, and as we watch, there is a burst of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots of light.

N: Tron and Yori enter. Solar Sailer simulation hovers. A LONG SHOT As Tron and Yori race across the floor.
C: YORI
D: This way...there's a simulation we can use...
E: V.0.
N: And we see them race towards it. 418 SHOT OF THEM RISING ON AN ELEVATOR PLATFORM, FROM 419 ABOVE, LOOKING DOWN AT THEM. A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER, RISING WITH TRON AND YORI We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft, designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and move with the speed of light. The sail is at the bow of the craft, and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the information paths to the Central Processing Unit.
C: TRON V.O.
D: Can it carry us?
C: YORI V.0.
D: The design is good... We don't know why the User abandoned the project...
N: The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center, forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked into place. SHOT OF THEM FROM THE LONG WALKWAY, FACING THE STERN We see Yori bending over a console of touch panels.
C: YORI
D: Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
C: TRON
D: As long as it gets us out of here

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SOLAR SAILER DECK - TRON AND YORI
N: Bending over the console, from the POV of the sail. As we watch, a head leans into the frame from the right. A memory guard. Then we see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the left.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE TWO OF THEM FROM A LOW ANGLE On the console, as Yori leans over it. We see that she is looking at a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the beam transfer points and transmission location.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE TWO GUARDS, CREEPING DOWN THE WALKWAY silently. We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise. His head snaps up; he sees the guards.
C: TRON
D: Yori! Get down!
N: THE GUARDS Abandoning any attempt at silence, leap forward, shouting, thrusting their staffs at Tron.
T: CUT TO:
N: A LOW ANGLE, AS TRON KICKS THE FIRST GUARD BACK and slashes the second across the face, knocking him out.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE HANGAR

T: CUT TO:
N: YORI'S POV - LONG SHOT looking down at the walkway. Beyond it we can see the great door starting to rise. TRON throwing his disk. It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them backwards.
T: CUT TO:
S: A SHOT FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE HANGAR
N: The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are racing towards the hangar. TRON Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway. We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated. There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing his balance. YORI smiling.
C: YORI
D: We're off!
S: EXT. HANGAR
N: The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft, from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast, accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of seconds.
S: EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - BRIDGE - SARK & MCP
N: Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and the Solar Sailer -- racing away.
C: MCP
D: I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
C: SARK
D: Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
C: MCP
D: Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
C: SARK
D: We'll get them, sir... These things take time.

We see one of the blue warriors hanging on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the edge, look over and see this guard. CLOSE SHOT OF TRON By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing shape comes into the frame from bottom right.

D: It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
N: Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.
C: YORI
D: A User -- in our world?
C: FLYNN
D: Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
E: nods
C: TRON
D: But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
C: FLYNN
D: You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
E: laughs
C: TRON
D: Then...
C: FLYNN
D: Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
C: TRON
D: Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
C: FLYNN

S: INT. DIMLY LIT CELL
N: Where we see Dumont plugged into energy foot sockets. Two memory guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest. Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND ANGLES UP to the second level where we see Sark looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell. CLOSE UP SARK MED. SHOT - DUMONT He looks up.

D: Where's he going?
T: CUT TO:
N: TRON'S FACE Also watching.
C: TRON
D: The beam connection... but he'll be de-rezzed!!
T: CUT TO:
N: SHOT IN FRONT OF SOLAR SAILER, FACING THE BOW We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly illuminated by the beam. He reaches forward with one arm.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLYNN'S HAND Entering the beam.
T: CUT TO:
N: SHOT FROM ABOVE FLYNN He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light. He raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same intensity as the beam.
T: CUT TO:
N: TRON AND YORI Shielding their eyes from the light.
T: CUT TO:
N: SHOT FROM ABOVE FLYNN His body glowing, arm outstretched. Suddenly another beam blasts out from his arm.
T: CUT TO:
N: LONG SHOT We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting to the safe beam. The craft starts to travel safely on its way.
T: CUT TO:
N: YORI'S FACE Radiant. Tron amazed.
T: CUT TO:
N: SIDE SHOT Tron races down the walkway toward Flynn, closely followed by Yori and the Bit.
T: CUT TO:
N: SHOT OF TRON Carrying Flynn towards the stern, carefully, gingerly with Yori watching.
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a moment, dazed.
C: FLYNN
D: Did we make it?
E: weakly
C: TRON
D: Yes.
N: Flynn smiles weakly.
C: FLYNN
D: Hooray for our side...
N: He faints.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A WATERY, WAVERING VIEW OF YORI Her face, upside-down, peering downward. SOLAR SAILER - TRON, FLYNN, YORI Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer is passing through a series of narrow canyons.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey... you guys OK?
C: TRON
D: How about you?
E: nods
C: FLYNN
D: Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
C: YORI
D: How did you do that, Flynn?
C: FLYNN
D: Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head Are we there yet, Mommy?
E: sitting up looks around -- to Yori
C: YORI
D: Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
N: She heads O.S., toward the bow. LONG SHOT The Sailer is about to pass the mouth of another canyon. TRON & FLYNN Tron looks away from Flynn for a moment to check the Sailer's progress. 492-500 OMIT 492-500 TRON'S POV as the new canyon comes into sight. CAMERA LOOKS UP AND UP... to the immense bulk of the aircraft carrier, moving fast toward the Sailer.
C: TRON
D: Sark!
E: V.0.
N: 502-519 OMIT 502-519 LONG SHOT The carrier lurches forward and rams the Sailer, splitting it in half. 521-523 OMIT 521-523 YORI AND FLYNN Falling on top of one another, Flynn trying to pull Yori out of the way as the bulk of the carrier appears to slam into Tron and he's gone.
T: CUT TO:
N: TRON falling through space.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLYNN AND YORI As the carrier keeps moving forward. Flynn holding Yori, and the Bit hovers beside them. A second level of the carrier, with an open hold, comes rushing at them. THEIR POV The gaping hold rushes forward and the screen goes black.
T: CUT TO:
N: 527A LONG SHOT 527A Their half of the Sailer is scooped up into the carrier.
T: CUT TO:
N: TRON catching hold of something. He is swinging freely. Hanging onto a wall, he starts pulling his feet up to gain a precarious foothold. 529/530 OMITTED 529/530
S: INT. DUMONT'S CELL
N: Dumont standing, facing the camera. HEAR door SLAMMING. FULL SHOT of cell. Yori rushes forward to Dumont. We see Flynn standing just inside the door, shoulders slumped and we can see that his disk has been removed. 532A MED. SHOT 532A Dumont holds Yori as she SOBS.
C: DUMONT
D: Quietly, Yori...
N: He looks up.
C: DUMONT
D: Tron... ?
E: continuing
N: Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the wall.
C: YORI
D: He's dead.
C: DUMONT
D: And who is this?
E: sighs, looks at Flynn
C: YORI
D: He's a User, Dumont. He came to our world... trying to help us...
N: Her voice breaks, she turns away.
C: DUMONT
D: If the Users can no longer help us...
E: despairing
N: His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the cell door.
C: SARK
D: So... we have erased the program that -
N: As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters.
C: SARK
D: You! No!
E: CONT.
N: Flynn looks up curiously.
C: SARK
D: You died! I saw you!
E: CONT.
C: FLYNN
D: Not me, boss.
C: SARK
D: Well... we can take care of that soon enough.
N: He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.
C: SARK
D: Take this program to the holding pit.
E: CONT.
N: The guards start to drag Dumont out.
C: YORI
D: Dumont...!
E: rushing after him
N: A guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell.
C: SARK
D: I'm taking our friend here, and some other religious fanatics, to Master Control... the MCP has expressed an interest in assimilating them -- probably for archival purposes. I'm not going back to the Game Grid on this ship, though -- I'll take the Transport Beam. Less traffic. But when I disembark, this ship...and everything that remains on board...will automatically de-rez. This means you.
E: indicates Dumont smiles
N: Enjoy your trip... LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow. SHOT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PIT CELLS into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs, the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards beginning to herd them out. ANGLE - LEVEL ABOVE CELLS where we can see Sark walking towards an open portal. He looks down into the cells at his feet and laughs again. FLYNN staring up as Sark moves past their cell and out of view. LONG SHOT of the carrier approaching a flat-topped mountain, with the communication beam of the MCP visible at the very center. 537/538 OMITTED 537/538 SHOT FROM THE CARRIER of the MCP's mesa moving closer, the only structure visible in a vast plain covered with a glowing grid.
S: EXT. BRIDGE AREA OF CARRIER
N: We can see the observation port and below that a section of the ship's structure is moving forward.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Docking module prepared to disengage, sir.
E: V.O.
N: INSERT Sark's hand touching a control panel. OMIT
S: EXT. SHOT
N: As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck clinging to one side of the pod... 543A CLOSE UP - SPECK 543A TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack. FLYNN, YORI AND THE BIT Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door testing it, running his finger along the edges. LONG SHOT Of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the MCP's mesa. A SHOT from behind the carrier of the pod getting smaller with distance. POD POV Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more and more detail visible. POD tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes, fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the structure.
S: INT. POD
N: There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly. Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam rises out of the center of this cylinder.
S: EXT. CARRIER
N: floating upwards and forward. MED. SHOT Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the door.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey!
N: The door is disappearing, dissolving.
C: FLYNN
D: Look, the door's almost...
E: continuing; turning
N: He stops in horror.
T: CUT TO:
N: HIS POV Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them. She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks up dimly at Flynn, with no expression. WIDE SHOT Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging her close, his energy flowing into her. Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.
C: FLYNN
D: Yori!
N: CLOSE SHOT Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch. Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.
C: YORI
D: You... you brought me back...? Why...? How ... ?
E: in awe
N: Flynn lets go of her.
C: FLYNN
D: I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!
N: He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers. Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration. Suddenly the Bit pops into life.
C: BIT
D: Yes!
C: FLYNN
D: Let's get outta here.
N: They head for the door. THE MESA TOP OF THE MCP The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger. The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the path.
S: EXT. POD DOOR - LIEUTENANT
N: on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand. CLOSER SHOT It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant. THE MCP from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside, up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP. SIDE SHOT OF THE ENTRANCE to the MCP. As the guardian programs enter. Sark stands waiting, watching them, his back to the camera. POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted, the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face, but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.
C: MCP
D: I am delighted that so many of you could turn out to give your power over to me...
E: echoing, booming
N: FULL SHOT - THE PROGRAMS lining the wall. They are sucked back, pinned, immobile, and we see them starting to de-rez.
C: MCP
D: You're very lucky, all of you. You are participating in the creation of the single most powerful program in the history of the system... of all systems...
N: The programs begin to disappear, one by one.
C: MCP
D: A program with a will... with ambition... a superior form of life...
E: continuing
S: EXT. MCP
N: Sark stands in front of Dumont.
C: SARK
D: Go!
N: Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner chamber. CLOSE - DUMONT'S FACE seeing the MCP, reacting.
S: INT. INNER CHAMBER OF MCP
N: Over Dumont's shoulder, with a view of the MCP. Zoom IN on MCP's face.
C: MCP
D: Welcome!
S: EXT. CARRIER BRIDGE
N: Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out the window.
C: FLYNN
D: Check out the controls.
N: As Yori looks over the control conso1e.
C: FLYNN
D: We're getting closer.
E: continuing
N: HIS POV Down the length of the carrier. It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone already. We see the CPU approaching, as the carrier rises.
S: EXT. LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT
N: The carrier drifts over the edge of the mesa, high above it, whole sections only visible as outlines.
S: 367A EXT. MCP 567A
N: CAMERA MOVING FORWARD towards the MCP's beam.
S: INT. MCP - MED. SHOT - DUMONT
N: He is slowly disappearing.
C: MCP
D: Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've finally come to terms with one another...
S: EXT. CPU MESA
N: Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to depart. His back is to the camera.
C: VOICE
D: SARK!
N: Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously.. SARK'S POV We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in one hand. It gives off a pure white light. CLOSE UP SARK'S FACE
C: SARK
D: I don't know how you survived, slave.
N: WIDE SHOT FROM THE SIDE
C: SARK
D: It doesn't matter. Prepare to terminate.
N: Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist. SHOT FROM ABOVE as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.
S: EXT. CARRIER BRIDGE
C: FLYNN
D: I can rev this baby up a little
N: He looks out sees something, does a double-take, looks again
C: FLYNN
D: Wait a minute Yori! YORI!! LOOK!
E: continuing
N: FULL SHOT as Yori runs to Flynn's side and-peers down.
C: YORI
D: TRON!!
N: CLOSE UP - YORI tears of joy streaming down her face. HER POV the fight continuing. 577A FULL SHOT - THE BRIDGE 577
C: YORI
D: Flynn, we've got to help him!
C: FLYNN
D: Let's get some power here.
N: His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE UP Sark's face.
C: SARK
D: You are very persistent, Tron.
N: MED. SHOT Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and immediately throws his own disk. SHOT OF TWO WEAPONS racing almost side by side through the air. SHOT OF TRON as the two disks come at him.
C: TRON
D: I'm also better than you....
N: He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as Sark's disk passes under him. SHOT OF SARK'S DISK Making a sharp turn in the air. SHOT OF TRON FROM BEHIND He looks over his shoulder, sees the disk coming at him. TRON'S HAND As he slams his own disk into Sark's, using his as a shield. 584A MED. SHOT SARK 584A
C: SARK
D: Very clever, Tron. You know you should have joined me.
N: OVERHEAD POV Tron hurls again. FLYNN AND YORI Flynn is at the controls, transferring power.
C: FLYNN
D: Any response?
C: YORI
D: It's starting
N: She looks down at the battle. Her hand reaches over and grips Flynn's tightly.
T: CUT TO:
N: SARK He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind, and holds up his own disk as a shield.
C: SARK
D: We would have made a great team.
N: TRON'S DISK turning sideways in its flight, edge on. SARK With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see energy pouring out of this wound like blood. LONGER SHOT Sark falls, dead, face first. TRON wailing past Sark's body. SHOT FROM BEHIND TRON as he goes in the MCP's inner chamber.
C: MCP
D: It is very good that you...
E: before he sees Tron
N: SHOT OF TRON framed in the doorway.
C: TRON
D: I don't think it is good for you, MCP.
N: SHOT OF MCP
C: MCP
D: Sark! How have you allowed this program to
N: SHOT FROM BEHIND TRON
C: TRON
D: Sark's out. Would you like to leave a message?
C: MCP
D: I am the message. The only message. Sark!
N: Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and returns to him.
C: MCP
D: SARK!
E: continuing
N: As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over to him. CLOSE SHOT - WALL Dumont is transparent. Tron runs up to him.
C: TRON
D: Dumont!
E: trying to pull Dumont away from wall
C: DUMONT
D: No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
C: TRON
D: Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
C: DUMONT
D: They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
E: very weak
N: MED. SHOT - TRON He turns, murder in his eyes, draws back his arm for the throw.
C: MCP
D: Program... stop. This is not allowed!
N: Tron throws. SHOT OF MCP The disk smashes into him. Once, twice...
C: MCP
D: I will not allow this Sark! SARK!!!
E: thundering
N: The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber. Tron continues to throw. INSERT Sark's dead hand. We see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy. The hand moves. TRON throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.
C: MCP
D: SARK!!!
E: thundering
N: SARK His body is glowing, expanding. He starts to rise, his face looks up. CLOSE UP - FACE It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises. LONG SHOT Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out, from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the beam. HIS POV OF BEAM very close. SHOT OF YORI AND FLYNN
C: FLYNN
D: Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
C: YORI
D: Why? What are you going to do?
E: going to controls
C: FLYNN
D: Jump.
E: staring down
N: Yori looks up.
C: YORI
D: But... won't you be de-rezzed?
C: FLYNN
D: Probably.
E: turns to her
S: INT. MCP - TRON
N: about to fire again. There's a sudden roar and Tron turns. TRON'S POV OF GIANT SARK Who rips open the doorway into the MCP and advances. BRIDGE Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn, goes up to him.
C: YORI
D: Flynn... you can't... I
C: FLYNN
D: Shhhhh.
E: lays finger on her lips
N: He takes her in his arms.
C: FLYNN
D: I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if... just once...
E: CONT. whispering
N: His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow, change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed. CLOSE UP - THEIR FACES Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second, then open.
C: FLYNN
D: Don't worry.
N: LONGER SHOT He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out. HER POV Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion directly into the center of MCP itself.
S: INT. MCP
N: Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but his voice is that of the MCP.
C: SARK/MCP
D: End of line, program...
N: We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle. Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once, and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy cones. And connects. SHOT OF THE APEX A brilliant explosion of lights bursts out. SHOT OF SARK Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely. SHOT OF THE MCP We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of the MCP glows brighter and brighter. YORI AND THE BIT on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this. HER POV A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the camera. YORI shielding her face from the power of the blast. LONG SHOT The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates, leaving the sky full of sparkling stars. YORI still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains regaining their life. HER POV one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows brightly, increasing. LONG SHOT The carrier starts to descend.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CPU MESA - TRON
N: Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending. SHOT OF CARRIER Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.
S: EXT. CPU MESA
N: Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.
C: TRON
D: Nice...
E: laughing
C: YORI
D: It's something Users do.
C: TRON
D: Where's Flynn?
N: He looks up at the bridge.
C: YORI
D: He's gone. He went into the beam. He saved you. He saved all of us.
N: Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.
C: DUMONT
D: He really was a User...
C: BIT
D: Yes...
E: quietly, sadly
N: LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: RACING OVER THE CIRCUIT PATTERN and returning to the real world. THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism. WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized. Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact -- back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world. He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent flesh and blood. He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with weak sunlight coming in. And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is coughing out a long document on wide blue paper. Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his face. The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant, tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA
N: Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey -- you guys
N: Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.
C: ALAN
D: Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
C: FLYNN
D: I know, I met him.
N: Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.
C: FLYNN
D: I mean, I saw it read-up - hey, look at this.
E: CONT.
N: He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of reading it to figure out its significance.
C: ALAN
D: Your old files -- ?
C: FLYNN
D: And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
C: ALAN
D: Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
N: Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.
C: FLYNN
D: You're telling me...
N: As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS on it. CRT SCREEN The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a typical video game: A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at first, then converge on the blue figure from three different directions.
C: FLYNN
D: you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
E: V.0.
C: LORA
D: Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
E: V.0.
C: FLYNN
D: Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
E: V.0.
C: ALAN
D: Your friend Dillinger sure won't...
E: V.O.
N: The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.
C: FLYNN
D: Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
E: V.O.
C: LORA
D: You're getting out of the business?
E: V.O.
C: ALAN
D: Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
E: V.O.
C: FLYNN
D: Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
E: V.0.
N: at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge. HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and BLACK OUT.
