T: FADE IN:
S: VARIOUS SHOTS OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS (EXT./DAY) ...
N: which may include the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market, scenes along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, Independence Square, the Russian Orthodox neighborhood, the ghettos of North Philly. MAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a SHOT OF...
T: CUT TO:
S: PHILADELPHIA'S GLORIOUSLY ORNATE CITY HALL (EXT./DAY) ...
N: TITLE: "Philadelphia City Hall." CITY EMPLOYEES, JUDGES, COPS, LAWYERS, CRIMINALS, TOURISTS pour into City Hall, into... TO: TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY). Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying an accordion file under his arm like a football. Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP. Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time TO: JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS making a racket... Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE." RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:
C: JOSEPH MILLER
D: This construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public!
E: OS
C: ANDREW BECKETT
D: My client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, Your Honor!
E: OS
N: Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT (in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes).
C: JUDGE TATE
D: One at a time. Mr. Miller?
C: JOE
D: Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
C: ANDREW
D: Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
N: Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs a document into Andrew's hand.
C: ANDREW
D: Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.
E: CONT.
N: Andrew submits the report to the Judge.
C: JOE
D: Innocuous?
C: ANDREW
D: Defined by Webster's as harmless.
C: JOE
D: I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
N: His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again:
C: ANDREW
D: Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. But nothing could be further from the truth. Rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! Granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society.
N: Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.
C: JUDGE TATE
D: Let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen. I thought we were talking about some dust.
T: CUT TO:
N: A MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ... As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro- cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite corner of the elevator, does exactly the same thing.
C: ANDREW JOE
D: ... plaintiff seeks to re- ... whereas decedent had strain defendants from con- pre-existing asthmatic tinued improper use of trade condition and ride on name without... Ultra Loop caused sub- sequent death...
N: Andrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other... And turn toward the corner, seeking privacy.
C: ANDREW JOE
D: ... plaintiff's permission or ... complainant seeks authorization... relief...
E: CONT. CONT.
N: There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their portable telephones at the same time. They look at each other: which phone is ringing?
C: ANDREW
D: You.
N: Andrew resumes his telephone conversation.
C: JOE
D: Right. Miller.
E: into phone
N: The ELEVATOR OPENS: Andrew breezes past the MAN ON CRUTCHES, saying to Joe:
C: ANDREW
D: Client of yours?
C: JOE
D: Funny.
N: Andrew hurries down the corridor. Joe waits a moment... then pursues the MAN ON CRUTCHES.
C: JOE
D: Excuse me..? Sir? Yo!
E: CONT.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANDREW EKERGES FROM CITY HALL, ONTO DILWORTH PLAZA BUSTLING with
S: PEDESTRIANS (EXT./DAY) ...
N: ... DARTS into the street, hailing a cab.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE CAB PULLS UP TO A BROWNSTONE ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET, Andrew hopping out, stuffing papers into his briefcase
S: (EXT./DAY) ...
N: RUSHING to the door marked "Dr. Roberta Gillman, Internal Medicine." Coming out is a YOUNG ASIAN MAN with a cotton ball taped to the inside of his elbow.
T: CUT TO:
S: CLASSICAL MUSIC (INT./DAY) ... AS CAMERA PANS PATIENTS
N: (MOSTLY YOUNG MEN) in a cheerful room... some, like a UPS DELIVERY MAN, are attached to IV's, some sit with arms extended, waiting to be hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a BLACK PHYSICIAN'S AID. CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running into his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of the CLASSICAL MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most of the people in the room look SICKER than Andrew. DIALOGUE CAN BE HEARD under the CLASSICAL MUSIC (although MUSIC dominates the SOUNDTRACK).
C: TYRONE
D: Gonna have to start looking for veins in your feet, sweetheart.
E: slapping a thin PATIENT'S wrist
N: DR. ROBERTA GILLMAN, passes through, speaking to Andrew:
C: DR. GILLMAN
D: Andy. Can you stop at my office on your way out?
C: ANDREW
D: Sure.
N: Andrew is distracted by A HISPANIC MAN across the room, rolling up his sleeve for an IV -- his bare arms, hands, face and neck are marked with PURPLE BLOTCHES. Andrew closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment on the CLASSICAL MUSIC... then goes back to work.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANDREW HURRIES OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, HAILING A CAB
S: (EXT./DAY) ...
T: CUT TO:
N: ANDREW HOPS OUT OF THE CAB, IN FRONT OF AN IMPRESSIVE skyscraper in downtown Philly, at the end of the work day
S: (EXT./DAY) ...
N: Andrew pushes through glass doors into the plush "Wheeler Building," pressing through the tide of WORKERS headed home.
T: CUT TO:
N: A BLACK PARALEGAL, ANTHEA BURTON, LEADS A YOUNG, BLACK LAW CLERK (in suit and tie) to the elevators, at the sedate, expensively appointed offices of Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown (INT./DAY) ...
C: ANTHEA
D: ... up to Tax, on fourteen, and get right back, I need you.
N: Andrew BLASTS out of the elevator, flashing Anthea a four- star smile. They stride down the corridor together.
C: ANDREW
D: Just the dazzling paralegal I wanted to see.
C: ANTHEA
D: I know what that means, and the answer is no. I have a class tonight. Exploit someone else. And since you've asked ...
E: friendly
N: They pass a silver-haired partner, KENNETH KILLCOYNE.
C: KILLCOYNE
D: Solid work on the Rockwell situation, Andy. Top-notch.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks, Kenneth. Your exam!
E: to Anthea
C: ANTHEA
D: Thank you. 98. I gotta go...
C: ANDREW
D: Ninety-eight?! Ninety-eight!
N: Andrew reaches the secretaries' station. A cheerful secretary, SHELBY, shoves documents at him.
C: SHELBY
D: Conference call's up. They just started the roll call. Here's the settlement agreement, the red-lined copy's on your desk. Need me in there?
C: ANDREW
D: No. Great. Thanks, Shelby. It's 6:30, go home.
E: checking his watch
N: Andrew passes a colleague on her way out, RACHEL SMILOW:
C: ANDREW
D: Rach.
E: CONT.
C: RACHEL
D: I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
C: ANDREW
D: Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
N: Andrew SAILS toward his office.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: ANDREW ENTERS HIS OFFICE, KICKING THE DOOR SHUT (INT./DAY).
N: ... DROPPING the documents on his desk, SCANNING them. ... ADMIRING a child's painting taped to the wall. ... PUNCHING into the speaker phone on his desk. The SCREEN SPLITS, REVEALING A TELECONFERENCE OPERATOR:
C: OPERATOR
D: ... Karen Hargreave, representing Lloyd Management Corporation?
N: The SCREEN SPLITS INTO THIRDS: Andrew, the OPERATOR, and HARGREAVE (a sharp, California lawyer.)
C: HARGREAVE
D: Present.
N: As the OPERATOR continues the roll call, the SCREEN CONTINUES TO SPLIT and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF LAWYERS in offices around the country, (MOSTLY WHITE MALES) saying "Present" while in Andrew's section of the screen... ... Andrew dials a number on another telephone line,
C: OPERATOR
D: Andrew Beckett, representing Saunders International?
N: Andrew punches into the conference call
C: ANDREW
D: Present.
N: The MULTI-IMAGE SCREEN is now joined by SARAH BECKETT, a suburban, 60ish American MOM, in her backyard garden, answering a portable phone.
C: SARAH
D: Hello?
C: ANDREW
D: Hi, Mom. It's me.
N: The LAWYERS are into the conference, in their portions of the screen, (their VOICES HEARD underneath Andrew's conversation with his mother).
C: SARAH
D: Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
C: ANDREW
D: I'm fine.
C: SARAH
D: What's Dr. Gillman say?
C: ANDREW
D: Hold on, Mom. There's no way my client will go along with that.
E: punching into the conference call
C: HARGREAVE
D: Who's this?
C: ANDREW
D: Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm sorry I interrupted...
N: He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing over his shoulder to make sure the door is shut).
C: ANDREW
D: Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ... Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns. My platelets look good too.
E: CONT. conference call back to Mom
C: SARAH
D: Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
T: CUT ON ANDREW'S LAUGHTER TO:
S: THE MOON ABOVE THE WHEELER BUILDING LATE AT NIGHT (EXT.)
N: TITLE: "One-thirty a.m."
T: CUT TO:
S: ANDREW AT WORK IN THE FIRM'S LIBRARY (INT./NIGHT) ...
N: Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer. Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather than a book.) Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a relevant citation:
C: ANDREW
D: Ah hah! Yes! Rentworth v. Pennsylvania... court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages for wrongful interference with prospective economic relations...
E: chewing a string bean
N: A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT. ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says:
C: KENTON
D: Look at this fucking guy. He's an animal.
N: Andrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard.
C: ANDREW
D: Walter.
N: The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos.
C: SEIDMAN
D: Are we interrupting, Andy?
C: ANDREW
D: In a word, Bob...
C: SEIDMAN
D: Charles is right behind me.
N: ANOTHER SILHOUETTED FIGURE APPEARS. This image has a horror-film feeling to it. Andrew WHIPS AROUND to face them.
C: ANDREW
D: I was just about to take a break. Good evening, Charles.
N: CHARLES WHEELER, also in tuxedo, remains in shadow.
C: WHEELER
D: Andy? Could you step into my office for a sec? I feel like firing someone tonight.
E: deadpan
N: Andrew throws an arm over Seidman's shoulder.
C: ANDREW
D: We're gonna miss you around here, Bob...
T: CUT ON LAUGHTER TO:
S: THE RECEPTION AREA (INT./NIGHT): A DOMINO'S PIZZA DELIVERY
N: MAN, waiting for clearance from a SECURITY GUARD, on Andrew's dim and quiet floor, WATCHES AS... Seidman, Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide, carpeted staircase. Wheeler finishes a story and everyone LAUGHS...
T: CUT TO:
S: A BOX OF CIGARS BEING HANDED AROUND (INT./NIGHT) ...
C: SEIDMAN
D: Andy's expressed a keen interest in the Kronos Inc. situation, Charles. Is that correct, Andy?
N: The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline.
C: ANDREW
D: The fate of the participants interests me, yes sir.
N: Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the cigars in and out of their rounded mouths. Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye. Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter. He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.
C: KENTON
D: It's good to be King, hey Charles?
C: WHEELER
D: Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant. It's an anti-trust action.
E: prompting Andrew
C: ANDREW
D: It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
C: WHEELER
D: Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would you desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
N: Andrew knows this is a test. And he loves it.
C: ANDREW
D: Sorry, Charles, but...
N: Andrew is distracted -- BY A LIGHT FALLING ACROSS HIS FACE.
C: ANDREW
D: I'd like to see Kronos win.
E: CONT.
N: Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its LIGHT FALLS ACROSS ANDREW'S FACE, REVEALING: a faint purple blotch about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw on the HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrew's doctor's office.
C: KENTON
D: Why, Beckett?
C: ANDREW
D: Because they deserve to, Walter.
N: Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed back, revealing the blotch. He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to cover the blotch.
C: ANDREW
D: If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
E: CONT.
C: SEIDMAN
D: Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
C: ANDREW
D: Bailey, Brackman.
C: WHEELER
D: Get with the program, Andy. As of this evening, about 8:05 this evening, right after the soup course... Kronos Incorporated is represented by Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown. Or, more specifically, senior associate Andrew Beckett.
N: A moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist in a victory salute.
C: ANDREW
D: Yes!
C: SEIDMAN
D: You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
N: An ASSOCIATE LAWYER in shirtsleeves taps on the office door.
C: ASSOCIATE LAWYER
D: Tokyo on four, Bob.
C: SEIDMAN
D: Great. Excuse me, fellas. Connichiwa. Itsumo osewa ni nari mashita. Arigato gozaimasu.
E: picking up a phone, speaking Japanese
N: Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks, Walter.
C: KENTON
D: What's that on your forehead, pal?
C: ANDREW
D: Whacked with a racquetball. I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
E: taking Wheeler's hand
C: WHEELER
D: Faith, Andy, is the belief in something for which we have no evidence. It doesn't apply to this situation. Go home. I mean, get back to work.
E: slapping his shoulder
N: Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks, Charles.
E: warmly, softly
C: WHEELER
D: No sweat, buddy.
E: with a father's affection
N: Smiling, Andrew exits the office. CLOSE ON WALTER KENTON, THINKING...
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: ANDREW STEPPING INTO THE EMPTY CORRIDOR, TAKING A FEW STEPS away from Wheeler's office (INT./NIGHT), then... ... DOING a JOYFUL END ZONE DANCE, running in place the way football players do when then score a touch down, saying "Yes! Yes! Yes!" to himself, soundlessly. The SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a maintenance worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his little dance and starts to laugh. Smiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS at Helena and says:
C: ANDREW
D: It's good to be King.
E: in a funny, kind of medieval way
T: CUT TO:
S: ESTABLISHING: ANDREW'S LOFT BUILDING (EXT. DAY)
N: TITLE: "Ten days later."
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON ANDREW'S FACE MARKED WITH FOUR BLOTCHES (WE'RE IN Andrew's loft -- INT./DAY) It's a mirror image. The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a dime, to the size of a half-dollar. He looks awful. A YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's face, trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend CHANDRA.
C: CHANDRA
D: You want to apply the foundation as evenly as you can, Andy. You don't want to look like you've thrown it on with a spoon.
E: O.S.
C: ANDREW
D: Uh huh.
E: O.S.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his loft, a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup. Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's command post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend, BRUNO, sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV.
C: CHANDRA
D: Okay. You try.
N: Andrew tries applying makeup to his face.
C: ANDREW
D: Chandra? Don't you think this color's a little... orange for me?
C: CHANDRA
D: Tahitian Bronze works best on lesions.
C: ALAN
D: Think of it as the "I just back from Aruba" look.
N: IN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in Andrew's "work area": desk, personal computer, etc.).
C: BRUNO
D: I got it.
N: Bruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to Andrew, handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks, Bruno. I've been out of the office four days. I don't want them to think I've been to the beach. Okay. Check this out.
E: giving the fax a quick scan to Alan and Chandra searching for something
N: Andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell frames, meant to help conceal the blotches.
C: ANDREW
D: Hides everything, right? What do you think?
E: CONT.
C: CHANDRA
D: You know who you look like, Andy? That actor, in that movie. Not the one where he was autistic, the one where he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera...
C: ALAN
D: Dustin Hoffman.
C: ANDREW
D: Tootsie!
E: horrified
C: BRUNO
D: Right.
C: CHANDRA
D: You want to try Light Egyptian?
N: Suddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut.
C: CHANDRA
D: What?
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Excuse me a sec...
E: clearly in pain
N: Andrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN.
C: CHANDRA
D: Just like my cousin Fredo.
N: CAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR slamming shut. Bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom door.
C: BRUNO
D: You okay, Andy?
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: TIGHT SHOT ON ANDREW, FACE TWISTED IN PAIN (INT./DAY) ...
N: Andrew rests his head against the wall, sweat covering his face. A storm of fire has passed through him, and he's hoping it's over for now.
C: ANDREW
D: I think I need to go to the hospital.
T: CUT TO:
N: MIGUEL ALVAREZ RUNS URGENTLY DOWN SPRUCE STREET, DODGING traffic as he crosses Eleventh Street, toward Jefferson Hospital (EXT./DAY). He hustles up the ramp toward the Emergency Entrance...
T: CUT TO:
N: MIGUEL SHOVES THROUGH GLASS DOORS, INTO THE BUSTLING Emergency Room (INT./DAY), FINDING ANDREW sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against his arm, where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over his shoulders, fighting chills. Chandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew. They exchange quick hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and goodbyes.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks, you guys.
C: MIGUEL
D: Yeah. Thanks, guys.
N: Miguel puts his arms around Andrew.
C: ANDREW
D: Gillman's out of her office today. I told her to take a day off, and she did, can you believe it? Did you get someone to cover your class?
N: Miguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever.
C: MIGUEL
D: Don't worry about it. They took blood? A specimen?
N: Andrew holds an empty specimen cup.
C: ANDREW
D: Aren't you giving an exam?
C: MIGUEL
D: I said, don't worry about it.
N: Miguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead.
C: MIGUEL
D: You got a fever, baby.
E: CONT.
N: Suddenly, the facade cracks and TEARS STING Andrew's eyes.
C: ANDREW
D: I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
C: MIGUEL
D: So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
E: holding him
N: Andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in control of his emotions once more.
C: ANDREW
D: Wait, here's my guy... Hey!
N: Andrew catches the attention of a harried INTERN, whose surgeon's greens are covered with blood.
C: INTERN
D: Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
C: ANDREW
D: About my blood work?
C: INTERN
D: We're waiting...
N: Miguel opens a small notebook, making notes.
C: INTERN
D: ... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
C: ANDREW
D: Sounds delightful.
C: MIGUEL
D: Why do you need to do this?
C: INTERN
D: Who are you?
C: MIGUEL
D: Who are you? Doctor... ?
C: ANDREW
D: This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
C: INTERN
D: Dr. Klenstein. It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
E: to Andrew
C: MIGUEL
D: It could be parasites, an infection...
C: ANDREW
D: A reaction to AZT...
C: KLENSTEIN
D: That's possible, but.
C: MIGUEL
D: He's not going through some painful procedure until we've cancelled out everything else.
C: INTERN
D: I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
C: ANDREW
D: He's upset, he's sorry.
E: to the Intern
C: MIGUEL
D: Don't apologize for me.
C: ANDREW
D: He's not sorry, okay, fine. Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
E: the diplomat
C: INTERN
D: Allright. I'll get on the lab about the blood work.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm sorry.
E: to the Intern
N: The INTERN walks away. Andrew's BEEPER BEEPS.
C: ANDREW
D: That's the third time. I better call the office. Would you relax, please?
E: smiling at Niguel
C: MIGUEL
D: I am relaxed.
N: Andrew HOBBLES toward a pay phone, outside a VISITOR LOUNGE, where weary relatives are watching TV. Andrew drops a quarter into the phone.
C: JOE MILLER'S VOICE
D: "If you or someone you know..."
N: ANDREW'S POV ON TELEVISION: Joe Miller on the screen, with the words "Negligence... Malpractice... Auto accidents"... and in the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS.
C: JOE
D: "... has been injured through the fault of others, you may be entitled to legal remedy...
E: CONT.
N: Andrew LAUGHS. Then, his call is answered:
C: ANDREW
D: Shelby? It's me. Jamey's been beeping me, I... Okay, okay, calm down. Put Jamey on.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: FIRST YEAR ASSOCIATE JAMEY COLLINS, SITTING AT ANDREW'S DESK (INT/DAY), GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew's intercom BUZZES...
C: JAMEY
D: Andy?! This is a disaster! We can't find your revisions on the Kronos complaint!
E: frantic
C: ANDREW
D: Slow down, Jamey, for Christ's sake!
C: JAMEY
D: I went down to Word Processing to pick up the corrected copy, but they said you haven't delivered the corrections. I told them you've been working on it at home, and...
N: Andrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important.
C: ANDREW
D: I brought it in last night, around midnight. It's in my computer.
C: JAMEY
D: What did you file it under?
N: Jamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard.
C: ANDREW
D: K-R-O-one.
N: Jamey types the file name.
C: ANDREW
D: Jamey, I don't have to mention, do I, that we're up against a statute of limitations on this complaint which runs out in... Seventy-five minutes.
E: CONT. checks his watch
N: Jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor.
C: JAMEY
D: It's not here, Andy.
N: Andrew closes his eyes. He can't believe this.
C: ANDREW
D: You go down to Word Processing and tell those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint, now! Or they are fucking dead! You tell them that comes from me!
N: Andrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle. He pauses, takes a deep breath, and says to himself:
C: ANDREW
D: Every problem has a solution. Every problem... has... a... solution.
E: CONT.
N: Calmer, Andrew returns to the gurney, putting on his shirt.
C: ANDREW
D: Every problem has a solution...
E: CONT.
N: Miguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen.
C: MIGUEL
D: Why are you getting dressed?
C: ANDREW
D: You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
N: Andrew puts his arms around Miguel.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... I will be back. An hour, tops.
E: CONT. pulling back, putting on his jacket
C: MIGUEL
D: You're going to the office?!
C: ANDREW
D: You're not smiling.
N: Andrew rushes toward the exit doors.
C: MIGUEL
D: You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
C: ANDREW
D: One hour!
C: MIGUEL
D: Drew!
C: ANDREW
D: I promise!
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: ANDREW RUSHES TO THE STREET, HAILING A CAB (EXT./DAY) ...
T: CUT TO:
N: ANDREW STEPS OUT OF THE TAXI IN FRONT OF THE WHEELER Building, heading for the entrance (EXT./DAY) ... But he changes his mind, darting to the corner of the block. Andrew stops to buy a baseball cap from a VENDOR. He trots down an alley, past bags of garbage, entering the building through a garage door.
T: CUT TO:
N: FROM A HIGH FLOOR, ANDREW CAN BE SEEN CLIMBING THE STEPS OF an emergency stairwell (INT./DAY) ... Andrew passes CAMERA, out of breath. He's wearing the ball cap PULLED TO HIS EYEBROWS to hide blotches on his forehead.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANDREW OPENS THE FIRE DOOR ON HIS FLOOR AT WYANT WHEELER, removing the ball cap, baring the purple blotches. (INT./DAY) He walks quickly down the hall. Passing a COLLEAGUE, Andrew pretends to scratch his face, attempting to hide the blotches as nonchalantly as possible. He dashes past an office, ignoring Anthea.
C: ANTHEA
D: Didn't expect to see you... ?
N: He ducks into his office.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: SECRETARY SHELBY AT ANDREW'S DESK, FRANTICALLY SEARCHING through papers (INT./DAY) ... Startled when he sees Shelby, Andrew spins toward the wall.
C: SHELBY
D: I'm looking through the files but...
C: ANDREW
D: Call the messenger service, have someone standing by... Your phone.
E: she reaches for the phone
C: SHELBY
D: Sure.
N: Andrew keeps his face averted, until she's out of the room. He goes to his computer, the monitor already glowing.
C: ANDREW
D: Think. You brought the discs in, you transferred...
N: Rachel comes into his office.
C: RACHEL
D: I thought I was supposed to be covering for you. God, Andy, you look awful.
E: blurts out
C: ANDREW
D: Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case... Every problem has a solution.
E: the mantra
C: RACHEL
D: What can I do?
C: ANDREW
D: Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
N: She rushes out. Andrew begins shoving floppy discs into the slots on his computer, bringing up each disc's directory.
C: ANDREW
D: No.
E: CONT.
N: He throws the disc to the floor. Shoves in another. Shoves in another, bending it in half.
C: ANDREW
D: No, goddammit!
E: CONT.
N: He pulls open a file drawer, dumping legal briefs onto the floor, frantically spreading them around with his foot. Andrew THROWS a document across the room, takes a breath. He picks up the telephone.
C: ANDREW
D: Bob? Something's come up. With Kronos. I don't want to upset Charles, but... Oh, shit, Bob, the complaint's due in forty minutes and I can't find it. No, you don't have to come... Great. Fucking great.
E: CONT. letting down his guard suddenly hanging up the phone
N: Andrew rubs his eyes, this is a nightmare. He switches off the overhead light. He slants the window blinds, filling the room with shadow Bob Seidman comes into the office, typically cheerful.
C: SEIDMAN
D: C'mon, Andy, you didn't lose anything...
N: Seidman is struck by the mess in the office, and Andrew's disheveled appearance.
C: SEIDMAN
D: Jesus.
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: I don't know what to do, Bob.
C: SEIDMAN
D: You'll never find it in the dark.
N: Seidman FLIPS ON the overhead light. Andrew flinches. Seidman approaches. Andrew gives up trying to hide the purple blotches, facing his mentor straight on.
C: SEIDMAN
D: What in God's name... ?
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Bob...
C: SEIDMAN
D: What's wrong with your face?
C: ANDREW
D: What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
C: SEIDMAN
D: Allright. Calm down.
C: ANDREW
D: Sorry...
N: Seidman sits in front of Andy's computer.
C: SEIDMAN
D: What was the file name?
C: ANDREW
D: K-R-O-one.
C: SEIDMAN
D: Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
N: Seidman goes to work. Andrew leans over his shoulder.
C: ANDREW
D: You're right, I probably just misfiled...
C: KENTON
D: Andy?
E: O.S.
N: Walter Kenton is standing at Andrew's door. His demeanor is casual. So casual it seems a little forced.
C: KENTON
D: Some sort of problem?
E: CONT.
N: Andrew has kept his face averted. But now he TURNS DIRECTLY TOWARD CAMERA, showing his face to Kenton.
C: ANDREW
D: Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of major problem.
N: HOLD ON THIS CLOSE UP OF ANDREW... SOUND OF A BABY CRYING CROSSES THE CUT TO:
S: A NEWBORN BEING LIFTED INTO A DOCTOR'S HANDS (INT./DAY) ...
C: DOCTOR
D: There she is, okay. You can relax now, Lisa.
N: LISA MILLER has just given birth to a baby girl. She collapses on her pillow, gasping for breath, moaning in pain, quietly crying a little. TITLE: "One month later." The NURSES and the (FEMALE) DOCTOR move professionally around the bed, doing their jobs. At Lisa's side, Joe fumbles with a camera while darting amazed looks back and forth between Lisa and the baby.
C: JOE
D: Oh my god... a girl... oh my god... Lisa... oh my god...
N: He's frantic.
C: JOE
D: You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
E: CONT.
C: LISA
D: Give me the camera, Joe.
N: Lisa pops the film into the camera, hands it back.
C: JOE
D: Thanks, hon. Oh my god...
N: With wildly trembling hands, Joe begins SNAPPING PHOTOS.
C: JOE
D: Oh my god... oh my god, look at her... oh my god...
E: CONT.
T: CUT TO:
N: JOE, WALKING THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR, STILL WEARING SURGEON'S greens, SPEAKING INTO HIS PORTABLE PHONE (INT./DAY) ...
C: JOE
D: Go to Famous Fourth Street and buy a pound of Nova. No! She likes Scotch salmon better. Ah heck, get a pound of both! Get a dozen onion rolls. Get some bagels. Get a dozen. Get a bottle of champagne. Dom Peringon... A hundred bucks a bottle?! Better get a good California...
N: Passing a PATIENT IN TRACTION, ROLLING BY ON A GURNEY, Joe drops a business card into the PATIENT'S broken hand.
C: JOE
D: Give me a call. Get everything over here as soon as you can, she's starved. No, not the baby! Lisa! ... Iris, listen: any calls I should know about? ... Uh huh... Uh huh... Beckett? Who's Andrew Beckett?
E: CONT. to the PATIENT into the phone
N: Turning a corner, Joe comes face to face with HIS RELATIVES, who charge at him joyfully:
C: JOE'S MOTHER/AUNTS/UNCLES, ETC.
D: Congratulations! How is Lisa?! When can we see the baby?!
T: CUT TO:
N: QUIET... JOE, LISA AND THEIR BABY CUDDLED TOGETHER IN Lisa's hospital bed, surrounded by debris from a party, paper plates, empty champagne bottle (INT./NIGHT) ... The relatives have gone. It's late at night. Lisa holds the baby. Joe holds them both.
T: CUT TO:
N: AN INTERSECTION IN THE HEART OF OLD, DOWNTOWN PHILLY: A movie palace (now a six-plex) across the street from the Peter Pan Coffee Shop, PHILADELPHIA WORKERS going about the business of the day (EXT./DAY) ... TITLE: "One week later." Above the Peter Pan Coffee Shop is a string of large windows, each of which is painted with a question: HEART ATTACK? ACCIDENT? MEDICAL MALPRACTICE? DOG BITE? In bigger letters, across several windows: D I A L 1 8 0 0 A - L A W Y E R We hear JOE MILLER'S VOICE-OVER:

E: OS
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: A HALLWAY BULLETIN BOARD ANNOUNCING THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS of "Macready and Shilts Legal Services" (INT./DAY), including "Auto/DUI/Collisions with Deer... Product liability... Medical malpractice... Pet bites..." The bulletin board stands at the entrance to a warehouse of lawyers' cubicles formed by office dividers and plastic ferns... PHONES JANGLING... INJURED CLIENTS LIMPING ABOUT...
C: JOE
D: And this hole was right in the middle of the street?
E: OS CONT.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: JOE IS IN HIS OFFICE, A BOX OF CIGARS ON THE DESK WITH PINK bands announcing "It's a girl!" (INT./DAY). On the walls are photos of INJURED CLIENTS (the same photos we saw in the background of Joe's TV commercial)... A FEMALE CLIENT (MRS. FINLEY) faces Joe, her arm in a sling.
C: MRS. FINLEY
D: Right.
C: JOE
D: Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
C: MRS. FINLEY
D: Why should I?
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: ANDREW IS SEEN FROM BEHIND, SITTING ON A SOFA IN THE WAITING area. Very little hair shows beneath a Phillies ballcap... A MAN WEARING A NECKBRACE, sitting next to Andrew, RISES, MOVING to a seat opposite Andrew. From this new position the MAN WITH THE NECKBRACE STARES at Andrew. MAN WITH NECKBRACE'S POV: The PURPLE BLOTCHES on Andrew's face are beginning,to recede, not as angry looking as before, thanks to chemo therapy. Andrew is dressed casually, in jeans and a softball jacket (from the Wyant Wheeler team) with "Andy" embroidered over the heart. Joe's assistant, IRIS, approaches.
C: IRIS
D: Mr. Beckett?
N: Andrew rises, following Iris past office dividers, HARRIED SECRETARIES and overflowing file cabinets. Iris cannot look at Andrew as she walks beside him. (Outside Joe's door is a sign: "Beware Mad Dog" with "Mad" written by hand.)
C: IRIS
D: In here.
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Thank you.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: ANDREW STEPS INTO JOE'S OFFICE (INT./DAY). ANDREW GLANCES
N: at the photos while Joe wraps up...
C: JOE
D: Explain this to me like I'm a six year old, okay? The entire street is clear except for one small area under construction, with a huge hole that is clearly marked and blocked off, and you decide you must cross the street at this spot. You fall into the hole and you want to sue the city for negligence? ...
E: to the FEMALE CLIENT
C: MRS. FINLEY
D: Yeah. Do I have a case?
C: JOE
D: Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement. Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
E: as they're leaving
C: MRS. FINLEY
D: Now that you mention it...
C: JOE
D: Tell Iris all about it. Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris. Beckett, come in.
E: leading her out to Andrew
N: Joe offers his hand, getting a look at Andrew's face.
C: JOE
D: Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: I have AIDS.
N: Joe WITHDRAWS his hand, before it touches Andrew's.
C: JOE
D: Whoa-oh! Sorry, I...
E: beat
C: ANDREW
D: It's okay. Can I sit down?
C: JOE
D: Uh, yeah.
N: Andrew hesitates. Joe doesn't sound sure.
C: JOE
D: Go ahead.
E: CONT.
N: Andrew sits, Joe returns to his desk. (Joe finds himself acutely aware of where Andrew places his hands.)
C: ANDREW
D: New baby?
E: the cigars
C: JOE
D: One week old.
C: ANDREW
D: Congratulations.
C: JOE
D: Little baby girl.
C: ANDREW
D: Kids are great.
C: JOE
D: Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it. What can I do for you?
E: glances at his watch
C: ANDREW
D: I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
C: JOE
D: You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
C: ANDREW
D: Correct. I'm seeking representation.
C: JOE
D: Continue.
C: ANDREW
D: I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
C: JOE
D: How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
C: ANDREW
D: Nine.
C: JOE
D: Continue.
C: ANDREW
D: I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
C: JOE
D: We?
C: ANDREW
D: My lover and I.
C: JOE
D: Your... lover?
C: ANDREW
D: Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
C: JOE
D: Continue.
C: ANDREW
D: I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
T: SUDDENLY PICTURE CUTS TO:
N: TIGHT ON ANDREW WAUKING THROUGH THE LOBBY OF THE WHEELER Building (INT./DAY). He's wearing MAKEUP, which sort of covers the blotches. (NOTE: PICTURE and ANDREW'S VOICE OVER do NOT match up. This is no ordinary flashback) ...
C: ANDREW
D: First on my leg. Then my forearm, my back. Then... my face. For a short period, I avoided the office during the day, waiting for the chemo therapy to clear up the lesions...
E: VO CONT.
N: IMAGE: ANDREW RIDING THE CROWDED ELEVATOR ON A WORKDAY.
C: ANDREW
D: But I never let anything slide. I made all my calls from home. I worked sixteen hour days on a complaint for a 350 million dollar copyright infringement suit.
E: VO CONT.
N: IMAGE: JOE IN HIS OFFICE, ABSORBED IN ANDREW'S STORY.
C: ANDREW
D: But the day the complaint was due, it disappeared. Erased from my computer. I thought I was losing it, mentally...
E: OS CONT.
N: IMAGE: ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING, ANDREW STEPPING INTO WYANT WHEELER OFFICES. NOW HE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO CAMERA:
C: ANDREW
D: That can happen, it's called AIDS dementia when it gets into your brain. But miraculously, a copy of the complaint was located at the last minute, and we got it to court on time...
E: CONT.
N: IMAGE: ANDREW'S POV OF COLLEAGUES, STAFF IN THE OFFICES, GIVING HIM LOOKS, WHISPERING. ANTHEA BURTON NODS HELLO.
C: ANDREW
D: The next morning, I was called to the office for a meeting with the managing partners. Walking down that corridor was strange. Felt like everyone was staring.
E: OS CONT.
N: REVERSE ANGLE ON ANDREW AND JOE WALKING AT ANDREW'S SIDE.
C: JOE
D: Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
C: ANDREW
D: Makeup.
N: ANDREW'S POV: RACHEL OUTSIDE HER OFFICE, SAYS "GOOD LUCK."
C: ANDREW
D: The partners were waiting for me in the main conference room.
E: CONT.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM, GIVING US ANDREW'S POV as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Bob Seidman are waiting (INT./DAY) ...
C: WHEELER
D: Sit down, Andy.
N: Wheeler's secretary, LYDIA, takes notes.
C: WHEELER
D: Thanks for coming in.
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Of course.
N: Bob Seidman CANNOT look directly at Andrew.
C: WHEELER
D: Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
C: JOE
D: You're in trouble.
N: (NOTE: Joe IS SEEN IN HIS OFFICE, or LEANING AGAINST A WINDOW IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM whenever he speaks.)
C: ANDREW
D: I know that, Charles.
C: WHEELER
D: More than your friend. Family.
C: JOE
D: Big trouble.
C: ANDREW
D: Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap. It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
E: smiling
C: KENTON
D: This time. What about next time?
C: ANDREW
D: There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
C: WHEELER
D: Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
C: KENTON
D: Helloooo...
C: KILLCOYNE
D: That's right, Andy. The last four, five months you've seemed really out of it...
C: SEIDMAN
D: At least... different, somehow.
C: ANDREW
D: Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
E: keeping it positive
C: KENTON
D: Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
C: ANDREW
D: Really? Who thinks that, sir?
C: WHEELER
D: I do.
N: Wheeler seems very grave.
C: ANDREW
D: I had no idea there was a concern in that area. Hey: I'll get to work on it right away.
E: a smile
N: NO ONE else smiles.
C: WHEELER
D: We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
C: ANDREW
D: Honesty is always best.
C: SEIDMAN
D: Do you really think so, Andy?
C: ANDREW
D: Yes, Bob, I do. Excuse me? Am I being fired?
E: to the group
C: WHEELER
D: Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
C: JOE
D: In a word, yes.
C: WHEELER
D: We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
N: Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.
C: WHEELER
D: And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
E: CONT.
C: JOE
D: But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
C: WHEELER
D: ... we've got a committee meeting.
C: ANDREW
D: Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
C: KENTON
D: Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
C: WHEELER
D: Take it easy, Walter.
C: ANDREW
D: If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
C: WHEELER
D: I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
C: ANDREW
D: A carrot?!
C: JOE
D: I buy that.
C: ANDREW
D: As in, the vegetable?
C: SEIDMAN
D: Andy, you nearly blew the case, for God's sake! That alone is inexcusable. It would have been catastrophic for us. Put yourself in our shoes, Andy. There's no coming back from an error like that, regardless of who you are! I'm sorry, Andy.
E: suddenly emotional softer
N: Andrew FREEZES -- the full nature of this situation hitting home. He looks each of the PARTNERS in the eye...
C: ANDREW
D: Uh huh... Okay... I see...
N: ... at last LOOKING DIRECTLY AT Wheeler's secretary Lydia, whose pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone to say something. Wheeler breaks the silence.
C: WHEELER
D: Good luck, Andy.
N: Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out. Andrew doesn't move. A SECURITY GUARD enters the room.
C: ANDREW
D: Who are you?
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: I'm here to escort you to your office so you can organize your belongings.
T: CUT TO:
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM ANDREW, WE'RE IN JOE'S OFFICE (DAY) ...
C: JOE
D: Okay. Explain to me like I'm a two year old, because there's an element to this I can't get through my thick head: Didn't you have an obligation to inform your employer you had this dreaded, deadly, infectious disease?
N: Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to disguise the effects of chemo.
C: ANDREW
D: The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
C: JOE
D: Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
C: ANDREW
D: Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
C: JOE
D: Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
C: ANDREW
D: They sabotaged me.
C: JOE
D: I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
C: ANDREW
D: Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
C: JOE
D: Correct. I don't.
N: Andrew rises, thoroughly business-like.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks for your time.
C: JOE
D: Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
C: ANDREW
D: Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
E: a smile
N: Andrew exits.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: ANDREW LEAVES JOE'S OFFICE, MOVING DOWN THE CORRIDOR (DAY) ...
C: IRIS
D: Have a nice day.
E: still uncomfortable, as Andrew's leaving
N: Andrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler named FILKO, who STARES SHAMELESSLY. Joe approaches Iris's desk.
C: JOE
D: Find out if Armbruster can see me this afternoon.
C: FILKO
D: What the hell's wrong with him?
E: still staring
T: CUT TO:
N: THE STREET: ANDREW EMERGES FROM THE LAWYER'S BUILDING (EXT./DAY). CLOSE ON ANDREW, standing there as an endless flow of people passes by. He watches them go, thinking...
T: CUT TO:
N: A SUBURBAN DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD
S: (EXT./DAY) ...
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
E: OS
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: A DOCTOR UNRAVELLING A BLOOD PRESSURE GAUGE (INT./DAY)
C: JOE
D: I'm not worried. What are you doing?
N: Joe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table.
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: Checking your blood pressure, relax.
N: The DOCTOR wraps the blood pressure unit around Joe's arm.
C: JOE
D: I didn't have contact. What do you consider "contact?" We were sitting in the same room, three, four feet... What if you shake hands? Wait. I know the answer. Only sex, or sharing needles. I know that. We didn't shake hands, anyway.
N: Dr. Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump,
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
C: JOE
D: Right.
N: Joe begins rolling down his sleeve.
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: Leave that.
C: JOE
D: Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You can carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
N: Dr. Armbruster has been preparing a syringe.
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: We're going to draw blood.
C: JOE
D: Why are we going to do that?
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
C: JOE
D: You want to give me an AIDS test?!
N: Joe HOPS off the table.
C: JOE
D: The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
E: CONT.
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: Right.
C: JOE
D: It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
C: JOE
D: Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
N: Joe throws on his jacket, opens the door... then TURNS BACK:
C: JOE
D: In my past?
E: CONT.
C: ARMBRUSTER
D: IV drug use.
N: Joe shakes his head.
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: A homosexual encounter.
E: CONT.
C: JOE
D: Get real.
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
C: JOE
D: Uh.... No. Not really.
E: thinking it over
C: DR. ARMBRUSTER
D: Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
N: A MOMENT. Joe returns to the examining table, and rolls up his sleeve.
T: CUT TO:
S: ESTABLISHING: JOE'S HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS (EXT./NIGHT) ...
C: LISA
D: You have a problem with gays, Joe.
E: VOICE OVER
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: JOB CRADLES HIS BABY AGAINST HIS CHEST (INT./NIGHT) ...
C: JOE
D: Not especially.
N: Lisa eats standing up, at the stove, while Joe walks the BABY in their modern kitchen.
C: LISA
D: How many gays do you know?
C: JOE
D: How many do you know?
C: LISA
D: Lots.
C: JOE
D: Who?
C: LISA
D: Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
N: For a moment, Joe is struck dumb. Then he says:
C: JOE
D: Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... lesbian?
C: LISA
D: Duh...
C: JOE
D: Since when?
C: LISA
D: Probably since she was born.
C: JOE
D: Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
C: LISA
D: Okay, Joe...
C: JOE
D: I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
C: LISA
D: Fine, Joe.
C: JOE
D: And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't stand that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
C: LISA
D: That's perfectly clear.
N: CLOSE ON JOE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA:
C: JOE
D: Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to breathe on me?"
T: CUT TO:
N: THE STREETS OF PHILLY ARE DUSTED WITH SNOW, STORE WINDOWS decorated for Christmas. Joe steps out of the Famous 4th St. Deli, with a package (EXT./DAY) ... TITLE: "Two weeks later."
T: CUT TO:
N: JOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN saunters by (INT./DAY) ... A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE: Andrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a package of tissues, blowing his nose.
C: JOE
D: Shit...
E: under his breath
N: Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him. JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS: Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes something. Sneezes. A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: This is the supplement. You're right, there is a section on... ... HIV related discrimination.
E: lowers her voice
C: ANDREW
D: Thank you.
N: Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: We have a private research room available.
C: ANDREW
D: I'm fine, thanks.
N: Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a research room?
C: ANDREW
D: No. But would it make you more comfortable?
E: pleasantly
C: LIBRARIAN
D: Whatever, sir.
N: The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating she's done all she can do. As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks up his books and moves away. Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye on Andrew, who concentrates on his work. Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew.
C: JOE
D: Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
C: ANDREW
D: Fine.
N: Andrew goes back to his work.
C: JOE
D: Who'd you get?
C: ANDREW
D: What?
C: JOE
D: Find a lawyer?
C: ANDREW
D: I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
C: JOE
D: Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
C: ANDREW
D: What's her name?
C: JOE
D: Rayisha.
C: ANDREW
D: Rayisha. Very nice.
N: Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away. Joe comes back.
C: JOE
D: How did they find out?
C: ANDREW
D: One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
E: a second, then:
N: Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she hears the word "lesion."
C: JOE
D: Uh huh...
N: Andrew concentrates on his work once more.
C: JOE
D: How do you get from one lawyer spotting a lesion, which could have been a bruise, to the partners deducing you had AIDS and basing a decision to terminate you on that conclusion?
E: CONT.
N: The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away.
C: ANDREW
D: Good point.
N: Andrew removes a legal pad with "KENTON" written in big letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.
C: ANDREW
D: The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
E: CONT.
C: JOE
D: They didn't fire her?
C: ANDREW
D: No. They didn't fire her.
N: Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there.
C: JOE
D: So Kenton connected the... lesion, and whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
C: ANDREW
D: Thank you.
N: Andrew goes back to work.
C: JOE
D: There is no relevant precedent.
C: ANDREW
D: Arline decision. Supreme Court.
E: not looking up
C: JOE
D: Arline?
N: Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe. CLOSE ON ANDREW'S HANDS (with one blotch) on the book's white pages. The book is still facing Andrew. If Joe wants to read it, he'll have to turn it around. Joe looks at Andrew's hands. A MOMENT. Joe turns the book around, begins to read:
C: JOE
D: "The Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination..."
N: CAMERA CRANES UP, TOWARD THE CEILING... JOE CONTINUES READING IN VOICE-OVER:
C: JOE
D: "... against otherwise qualified handicapped persons who are able to perform the duties required by their employment..."
E: VO CONT.
N: CAMERA GOES HIGHER, LOOKING DOWN ON THE ROWS OF BOOKS AND THE LONG TABLES DOTTED WITH PEOPLE...
C: JOE
D: "Although the ruling did not address the specific issue of HIV and AIDS discrimination..."
E: VO CONT.
N: DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER: Andrew and Joe face each other at their table, but NO ONE ELSE remains at that table, or at the table next to it...
C: ANDREW
D: "Subsequent decisions have held that AIDS is protected as a handicap under law, not only because of the physical limitations it imposes..."
E: VO
N: DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO NIGHT): Joe pacing, Andrew reading. Their section of the library is COMPLETELY EMPTY but for Andrew and Joe.
C: ANDREW
D: "But because the prejudice surrounding AIDS exacts a social death which precedes the actual, physical one..."
E: VO CONT.
N: DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE, LATER: Andrew and Joe sit on the same side of the table, reading the same book.
C: JOE
D: "This is the essence of discrimination: formulating opinions about others not based on their individual merits but, rather, on their membership in a group with assumed characteristics...
E: VO
N: The library is QUIET. Andrew SNEEZES. Joe scoots his chair away from Andrew by eight inches. DISCO MUSIC RISES ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOUNDS OF GRUNTING, HEAVY BREATHING AND SLAPPING FLESH AS WE...
T: CUT TO:
N: MUSCULAR, SWEATY MALE BODIES SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, sounds of GRUNTS, skin SLAPPING against skin (INT./NIGHT) ... ... Hand SLAPPING a butt under satin shorts ... Sweaty armpits... the ROAR OF A CROWD... ... BASKETBALL PLAYERS embracing, twirling each other around, high fiving... WIDE ANGLE REVEALS: A basketball game in progress, Sixers versus the Celtics in Philly's Spectrum Arena. ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TV: ROBERT PARISH going for a lay-up...
C: WHEELER/KENTON/OTHERS
D: Watch this guy! Nail him! Ouch!
N: Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Kenneth Killcoyne, Bob Seidman and SEVERAL LAWYERS and SPOUSES watch the game from a plush, private box, complete with TV, bar, snack table. The lawyers wear Ralph Lauren polos, chinos and ball caps. The place reeks of cigar smoke. Walter Kenton has a twentyfive year old WIFE. Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby. Wheeler turns the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling lovingly at the boy. JUST BEYOND WHEELER: The door to the box is opened by a SECURITY GUARD and a well-dressed, charismatic MAN looks in.
C: WHEELER
D: Julius!
E: spotting him
C: KENTON
D: Dr. J.!
C: DR. J.
D: Gentlemen... Ladies...
N: JULIUS ERVING enters, greeted by the LAWYERS.
C: LAWYERS
D: How's it goin', Doctor?/This is an honor!/etc ...
N: The door is opened again, by the SECURITY GUARD, REVEALING Joe Miller (in jeans and basketball jacket) and a MARSHALL.
C: JOE
D: Excuse me. Charles Wheeler?
N: Wheeler turns. Joe SLAPS a document into Wheeler's hand.
C: JOE
D: Summons. For you.
E: CONT.
N: NOW the box is QUIET.
C: DR. J.
D: Say. What's up, Chuck?
T: CUT TO:
N: THE BRIGHTLY LIT, RESTRICTED, INNER CORRIDOR OF SPECTRUM Stadium (INT./NIGHT) where Wheeler walks beside Bob Seidman, with Walter Kenton and Kenneth Killcoyne just behind. SOUNDS OF THE GAME STILL IN PROGRESS can be heard, but FAR AWAY. Occasionally the lawyers are passed by FOOD SERVICE or LAUNDRY SERVICE EMPLOYEES...
C: WHEELER
D: ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did any of them know Andy was sick? How did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
C: SEIDMAN
D: Jesus.
C: WHEELER
D: What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
E: ignoring Seidman
C: SEIDMAN
D: Charles...
C: WHEELER
D: What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!
E: with irritation
C: SEIDMAN
D: Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
N: They arrive at a quiet, semi-private cul de sac.
C: WHEELER
D: Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
C: KENTON
D: We ought to be suing him.
C: SEIDMAN
D: For Christ's sake, where's your compassion?
C: KENTON
D: Compassion? Andy sucks cocks, Bob. He takes it up the ass. He's a pervert.
N: Only Seidman shows any kind of REACTION.
C: SEIDMAN
D: That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
C: WHEELER
D: Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
C: SEIDMAN
D: He was doing a great job.
C: WHEELER
D: Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the best of my ability?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
C: KILLCOYNE
D: Beckett doesn't want to go to court, he's hoping for a quick tasty settlement.
C: SEIDMAN
D: A jury might decide that Andy has a case.
C: WHEELER
D: Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
C: KENTON
D: Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
C: SEIDMAN
D: No. Not really.
E: after a moment
N: Wheeler walks away, followed by Kenton and Killcoyne. Bob Seidman stands alone in this dark place. CITY SOUNDS ON A WORK DAY AS WE CUT TO: EXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, ON A THURSDAY MORNING.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: JOB'S COLLEAGUE, FILKO, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA (in Joe's offices, INT./DAY):
C: FILKO
D: Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler?!
N: Joe sweeps by, just arriving for work.
C: JOE
D: Morning, Filko.
N: Filko keeps pace with Joe down the corridor. ANOTHER COLLEAGUE calls out from an office as Joe passes:
C: COLLEAGUE
D: Hey, it's the local chapter of the ACLU!
C: FILKO
D: You're a Republican, Joe! You belong to the NRA!
C: JOE
D: How many toilet stalls are there in the women's restroom on this floor, Filko?
C: FILKO
D: How many... what?!
N: Filko follows Joe into Joe's office.
C: JOE
D: Two. How many toilet stalls are there in the men's room? Two, plus four urinals. How many wheelchair accessible toilets in either of those restrooms? Zero. In this entire building? Zero. Get the picture, Filko? Discrimination! You find yourself a female, paraplegic, legal assistant who is qualified to work here, except she can't take a leak... and you've got yourself a sex discrimination suit and a handicapped discrimination suit. Not handicapped. What do you call someone who can't use a normal restroom? "Gastro-intestinally challenged!"
N: Behind Joe, out a large window: PAINTERS on a scaffold. Iris comes into the office and says:
C: IRIS
D: Wyant Wheeler's asking for a postponement on the prelim, Joe.
N: Joe is dialing the phone.
C: JOE
D: Low-life, sleazy scumbags. Of course they want a postponement, I've got a client with a terminal disease. They're going to drag their heels every step of the way, the rotten bastards. (tapping on the window, to the
C: PAINTERS)
D: Is that spelled right?
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: JOE'S VOICE COMES THROUGH, ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE IN Andrew and Miguel's loft (INT./DAY)
C: JOE
D: I just wanted to tell you...
E: VO CONT.
N: CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH the loft, finding Andrew in the rooftop solarium, sitting crosslegged in front of a candle.
C: JOE
D: ... we're trying to set a date for the prelim. Hang in there.
E: VO CONT.
N: Andrew's eyes are closed. Next to him rests a tape player. A WOMAN'S VOICE IS HEARD, accompanied by NEW AGE MUSIC:
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: I can heal myself.
C: ANDREW
D: I can heal myself.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: I can heal myself.

D: I can heal myself.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANDREW AND MIGUEL IN THEIR BEDROOM AT NIGHT, LYING CLOSE TO each other in bed (INT./NIGHT) ...
C: MIGUEL
D: I was coming out of the gym today, and I ran into Jimmy. Do you know what he asked me? "What's it like knowing your boyfriend's going to die?"
C: ANDREW
D: Jerk... What did you say?
C: MIGUEL
D: I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
N: Miguel strokes Andrew's hair.
C: ANDREW
D: You got that right, Mikey... You still believe that, don't you?
E: beat
C: MIGUEL
D: Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
N: HOLD ON MIGUEL AND ANDREW, ON THIS QUIET MOMENT.
T: FADE OUT.
S: FADE IN: ESTABLISHING, EXT. PHILADELPHIA COURT HOUSE
N: (DAY) ... TITLE: "Three months later."
T: CUT TO:
N: A LONG CORRIDOR IN A CITY COURT BUILDING -- FAR DOWN THE corridor TWO FIGURES WALK TOWARD CAMERA (INT./DAY) ... The figures APPROACHING CAMERA are Andrew and Joe, stepping into and out of sunlight falling through tall windows. TITLE: "Pre-trial settlement conference." REVERSE ANGLE -- DOWN AN OPPOSITE CORRIDOR: A PHALANX OF LAWYERS -- at least ten -- APPROACHING CAMERA, a bulwark of white shirts and dark ties. ON ANDREW AND JOE: Andrew's hair is short, but growing back, the blotches have receded,his weight is up. He's in a stage of recovery. ON THE OTHER LAWYERS: Charles Wheeler (seeming ironic) and Walter Kenton (he's pissed) lead the battalion. Behind them, walk young lawyers BELINDA CONINE and JEROME GREEN. Belinda is white, Jerome is black.
T: CUT TO:
S: HUSHED VOICES (INT./DAY) ...
N: A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a loose circle, like a casual living room. Joe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team takes up several chairs. Belinda Conine and Jerome Green sit next to Wheeler and Kenton. Some of their ASSISTANTS stand. Wheeler is looking across the room at... Andrew, who catches Wheeler's stare.
C: WHEELER
D: You're looking better, Andy. How do you feel?
N: SILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction.
C: ANDREW
D: Fine, thanks, Charles.
N: JUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a Judge's robe). He shakes hands with Wheeler and Kenton.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Charles, Walter...
C: WHEELER
D: Congratulations on the new grandson.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Thank you. We're very happy.
N: The Judge brushes by Joe and Andrew without a word. The room becomes SILENT as the Judge takes a seat.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Attorney for the plaintiff?
C: JOE
D: Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the negligence of others."
C: JOE
D: I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: On behalf of the defendants?
C: BELINDA CONINE
D: Belinda Conine. Of Petersen, Lehigh, Monroe and Smith.
C: JEROME GREEN
D: And Jerome Green.
N: And a WASPISH lawyer wearing round glasses:
C: DEXTER SMITH
D: Dexter Smith.
N: A white-haired lawyer next to Belinda:
C: RALPH PETERSEN
D: Ralph Petersen.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: You're outnumbered four to one. Whom do I address? I can't talk to four lawyers at once.
E: to Joe to the others
C: BELINDA
D: I'm chief litigator, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Fine. I've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... There is nothing I hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. If you look at the opinion polls, when Mr. John Q. Citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... Where are the lawyers? Somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers. If we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list. And when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. And when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages.
C: JOE
D: If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this matter.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: By God you will settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
C: JOE
D: Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Hold it, Joe. He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
E: to Wheeler
C: WHEELER
D: That's impossible, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: That's impossible, Joe.
C: BELINDA CONINE
D: If it please Your Honor, we're prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty-five thousand dollars.
C: JOE
D: Your generosity overwhelms me, Belinda, considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Give me a break, Joe. Let's cut through these false attitudes. Give them a figure. How much do you want?
C: ANDREW
D: I want to go back to work, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: You're here at my indulgence, young man. I'm waiting for a figure, Joe.
N: Andrew and Joe confer with each other.
C: JOE
D: Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
N: Andrew WHISPERS to Joe, who interrupts the Judge:
C: JOE
D: One more thing, Your Honor...
C: ANDREW
D: Any settlement agreement must include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
E: jumping in
N: Charles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine.
C: BELINDA CONINE
D: Your Honor, Mr. Beckett's incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million dollar suit.
C: ANDREW
D: I was the one who was sabotaged.
C: BELINDA CONINE
D: We have complaints about Mr. Beckett's lack of preparation, his disorganization, his arrogant, defensive attitude... The list goes on.
C: JEROME GREEN
D: We have letters.
C: JOE
D: Why haven't you produced these letters?
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Take it easy. What's the big deal, Chuck? The boy wants a letter, to show to his mother, for her to keep after he's gone. Why are you being hard- assed about this?
E: to Wheeler
C: WHEELER
D: I wish I could exonerate you, Andy. But I'd have to lie to do it.
C: ANDREW
D: You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer. Gentlemen. Counselor.
E: very calm rises to Belinda
C: WHEELER
D: Don't do this, Andy.
C: JOE
D: Whoa, whoa... What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
E: to Andrew
C: KENTON
D: A trial takes time, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
C: ANDREW
D: I think I catch your subtle drift, Walter.
N: Andrew saunters out.
C: KENTON
D: You'll be sorry, Beckett.
C: WHEELER
D: Andy, you don't want this.
N: Joe scans the room, all eyes are on him. His frown turns into a grin. He faces the Judge.
C: JOE
D: With all due respect, Your Honor, my client chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial.
N: Joe exits.
T: CUT TO:
N: HAND HELD CAMERA SHOT OF: THE FRONT YARD OF A TWO-STORY Colonial house in Downington, Pennsylvania (EXT./DAY) ... Andrew walks toward the house, TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA.

E: pointing to the ground
N: The CAMERA POINTS to SEVERAL PAIRS OF CHILD'S HAND PRINTS in the sidewalk, then, BACK TO ANDREW IN CLOSE UP, SMILING.

E: CONT.

C: ANDREW
D: Today is my parents' fortieth wedding anniversary.

D: This is the front door. I caught a finger in this door, once... This one. Broke it. This is the hallway, my mother calls it a foyer...
E: CONT. holds it up stepping inside
S: INSIDE THE HOUSE (INT./DAY):
N: CHILDREN are running through the house, while WOMEN sporting corsages confer in the kitchen. A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL jumps into Andrew's arms.
C: ALEXIS
D: Uncle Andrew!
C: ANDREW
D: This is my niece, Alexis. Say hello, Alexis.
E: to CAMERA
C: ALEXIS
D: Mommy's pregnant again.
C: ANDREW
D: You heard it here first, folks. News as it happens.
E: doing Walter Cronkite
N: Andrew's older and very down to earth sister JILL, puts her arms around Andrew, squeezing tight.
C: JILL
D: Hello, darlin'.
C: ANDREW
D: This is my sister, Jill, the most fertile woman on the planet. She's married to Reverend Jim.
C: JILL
D: You feel thin. Hello, Miguel.
E: over Andrew's shoulder
N: As Jill leaves Andrew's arms, the CAMERA IS TRADED OFF TO ANDREW, who SHOOTS JILL GIVING MIGUEL A HUG.
C: MIGUEL
D: Hey, Jill. Nice to see you, sweetheart.
C: JILL
D: Handsome devil. Is he eating?
E: hugging Miguel referring to Andrew
C: MIGUEL
D: We don't discuss his weight. Do we?
E: to Andrew, behind CAMERA
N: CAMERA MOVES DOWN THE CORRIDOR...
C: ANDREW
D: And what will we find in... da duh da duh da duh... the KITCHEN!
E: OS
N: A GROUP OF LADIES SCREAM when CAMERA ENTERS KITCHEN.
C: LADIES
D: There he is! Hi, Andrew! Don't point that thing at me! etc...
N: Andrew's mother Sarah wears an unpretentious flowery dress.
C: ANDREW
D: Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
C: SARAH
D: Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
E: he keeps it pointed at her
C: ANDREW
D: Where's Dad?
C: SARAH
D: He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
N: One of Andrew's YOUNG NEPHEWS SHOVES HIS FACE into the CAMERA, UNTIL SCREEN GOES BLACK.
T: CUT TO:
S: QUIET (INT./DAY) ...
N: Andrew and his immediate family are gathered in the den, sitting quietly, facing each other. Andrew's father, BUD, with an American flag pin in his lapel, sits next to Sarah. Jill holds the hand of her husband, REVEREND JIM. Two of Andrew's brothers, MATT and RANDY, (big, athletic guys with mustaches) are there. Andrew sits next to Miguel.
C: ANDREW
D: Things might be said, at the trial, that... are not going to be easy for you to hear. Things about me, about my private life. And I want to make sure it's okay with everybody.
C: MATT
D: I appreciate you asking, Andy, but really, it's your call.
C: ANDREW
D: What do you think, Jill?
C: JILL
D: To be honest, I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy. They've had to go through so much already... And, we all know... There's going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually. I wonder if it's fair to put them through this.
E: very difficult to say
N: Andrew's father STARES at his folded hands.
C: ANDREW
D: Mom?
C: SARAH
D: All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks, Mom... Dad?
N: There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks.
C: BUD
D: Supposedly, the Lord doesn't give you more trouble than you can handle. But I'm having a hard time believing that these days.
N: Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears from his eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain.
C: BUD
D: Andy, the way you've faced this whole thing, you and Miguel, with so much courage... your mother and I have been so very impressed...
E: CONT.
N: Andrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts an arm around Andrew.
C: BUD
D: I can't imagine there is anything, that anyone could say, that would make us feel less proud of you.
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How about you, Randy?
E: full of emotion
C: RANDY
D: Hey. You're my kid brother, Andy. That's the bottom line. I mean, what are those bastards going to say? You're gay? Shit, I knew that when you were five years old.
N: Everyone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five.
C: MIGUEL
D: Wait a minute... You're gay?
E: to Andrew
N: More laughter. But Jill speaks seriously:
C: JILL
D: What about you, Andy? You're not a militant type. You've always been so private.
N: CLOSE ON ANDREW:
C: ANDREW
D: I guess... I don't have time for that any more.
C: SARAH
D: Jim? Will you lead us in a prayer?
N: Everyone bows heads, holding hands in a circle.
C: REVEREND JIM
D: Dear Lord. Sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful...
N: CAMERA PANS THE CIRCLE, THE PRAYING FACES.
C: REVEREND JIM
D: To remember, in our times of sorrow and confusion, that we have You to turn to, and each other. Bless and keep Andrew and Miguel, dear Lord, deepen and strengthen their love as they face the struggles that lay ahead. Bless and watch over all of us, fill us with Your love, Your light, and Your peace, which passeth all understanding. In Jesus' name, we pray...

D: Amen.
T: ROMANTIC MUSIC CROSSES CUT TO:
N: BECKETTS' LIVINGROOM, SEEN THROUGH THE VIDEO CAMERA (DAY) ... A local entertainer (GUIDO PAONESSA) launches into a standard, accompanied by a single guitar player, and Bud and Sarah begin to dance, surrounded by family and friends.
C: GUIDO
D: "After all the days of Spring have flown..."
N: VIDEO CAMERA PANS: RELATIVES eating cake, KIDS chasing each other, a GRANDMOTHER in a wheelchair holding a NEWBORN, watching silent, video home movies. CAMERA FINDS Andrew and Niguel eating anniversary cake (Andrew barely touches his). Playing for the camera, Miguel dips his finger into icing and smears it onto Andrew's nose. Andrew tries to reach the icing with his tongue. CAMERA PANS WITH ANDREW as he comes forward to dance with his mother, while Jill dances with their father. CAMERA RETURNS TO MIGUEL. MATT (behind the camera) says:
C: MATT
D: Hey, Miguel, can you imagine any two people being together for forty years?

D: There won't be any last minute, surprise witnesses...
E: OS CONT.
T: CUT TO:
N: A MAN LOOKING INTO CAMERA: HE'S YOUNG, CONFIDENT, ALL American, a Marine (INT./DAY) ... TITLE: "Opening statements." The MARINE is a JUROR. CAMERA PANS others: a BLACK LADY SCHOOLTEACHER, a POSTAL WORKER, an ASIAN COLLEGE STUDENT.
C: JOE
D: No one will break down on the stand with a tearful confession...
E: OS CONT.
N: REVERSE ON JOE, ADDRESSING THE JURY.
C: JOE
D: You are presented with a simple fact: Andrew Beckett was fired. You will hear two explanations for why he was fired. Ours. And theirs...
E: CONT.
N: Joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of... ANDREW, whose appearance has changed: thinner, paler than we've ever seen him, some blisters on his lips. But the most disturbing thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a much older man. He's taking notes (which he will do relentlessly throughout the trial.) And he has a cane at his side, which he'll use throughout the trial.
C: JOE
D: It's up to you, to sift through layer and layer of truth, and determine for yourselves the version that sounds the most true.
E: CONT.
N: Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Bob Seidman, Kenneth Killcoyne sit BEHIND their lawyers, Belinda Conine and Jerome Green, and SEVERAL ASSISTANTS at the defense table. JUDGE GARNETT presides from his bench. Among the spectators, Miguel sits next to Sarah, and Andrew's sister Jill. AIDS ACTIVISTS in the background.
C: JOE
D: There are certain points in our version, that I must prove to you... Point number one: Andrew Beckett was... is a brilliant lawyer. A great lawyer. Point number two. Andrew Beckett, afflicted with a debilitating disease, made the legal, understandable, personal choice to keep the fact of his illness to himself... Point number three: His employers discovered his illness. And ladies and gentlemen, the illness I'm referring to, is AIDS...
E: CONT.
N: Joe pauses, letting that sink in.
C: JOE
D: Point number four. They panicked. And, in their panic, they did what most of us would like to do with AIDS... Get it, and the people who have it, as far away from us as possible.
E: CONT.
N: Joe walks away from Andrew.
C: JOE
D: The behavior of Andrew Beckett's employers may seem reasonable to you. It does to me. After all, AIDS is a deadly, incurable, disease...
E: CONT.
N: CLOSE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY.
C: JOE
D: But however you come to judge the behavior of Charles Wheeler and his partners in moral, ethical, human terms... When they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, they broke the law.
E: CONT.
N: With a swift, direct glance at the Judge, Joe speaks with considerable power and emotion:
C: JOE
D: And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
E: CONT.
T: CUT TO:
S: BELINDA CONINE ADDRESSING THE JURY (INT./DAY) ...
C: BELINDA
D: Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did not know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
N: Belinda pauses in front of the plaintiff's table
C: BELINDA
D: Fact. AIDS is a tragedy...
E: CONT.
N: Andrew looks directly at Belinda.
C: BELINDA
D: Fact. Andrew Beckett is dying.
E: CONT.
N: Joe watches Andrew for his reaction.
C: BELINDA
D: Fact. Andrew Beckett is angry. Because his "lifestyle," his reckless behavior, has cut short his life... And in his anger, his rage, he's lashing out. And he wants someone to pay.
E: CONT.

N: ON THE WITNESS STAND: A SOLIDLY BUILT EXECUTIVE FROM A large insurance company, MR. LAIRD (INT./DAY) ...
C: JOE
D: Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
C: LAIRD
D: Wyant Wheeler represented us.
N: Andrew glances toward the jury box: the MARINE JUROR writes in a tiny notebook.
C: JOE
D: But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
C: LAIRD
D: That's correct.
C: JOE
D: Were you pleased with his work?
C: LAIRD
D: We were satisfied.
N: Joe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Laird's response surprises and disappoints them.
C: JOE
D: Were you satisfied, or were you pleased?
N: Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering.
C: LAIRD
D: We were satisfied.
N: Joe refers to legal documents.
C: JOE
D: Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
C: LAIRD
D: That's correct.
C: JOE
D: According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
C: LAIRD
D: I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
N: Joe takes on a street-tough tone:
C: JOE
D: Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
C: LAIRD
D: We won.
C: JOE
D: Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
C: LAIRD
D: It satisfied me.
N: Joe STARES at the guy.
C: JOE
D: It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
C: LAIRD
D: I might.
C: JOE
D: Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
C: LAIRD
D: Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
T: QUICK CUT TO:
S: JEROME GREEN CROSS-EXAMINING LAIRD (INT./DAY).
C: JEROME GREEN
D: Partner Robert Seidman was the supervising attorney for your lawsuit?
C: MR. LAIRD
D: That's right.
C: JEROME GREEN
D: Does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial?
C: MR. LAIRD
D: Often, he does.
C: JEROME GREEN
D: As far as you know, in the handling of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was simply following orders.
C: LAIRD
D: That's a fair assessment of the situation.
N: Andrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who meets his gaze.

N: ON THE TV SCREEN: The REPORTER wraps up her story.
C: REPORTER MEDINA

C: FILKO
D: Hey, Joe. You're not starting to get a little... light on your feet here on us, are you?
E: chuckles a wink to the COP
N: Joe does not laugh.
C: JOE
D: Yeah, Filko. I am. I'm on the prowl, Filko. I need a man. Not just any man. I need a hunk. A hunk like you. How about it, Filko? Want to play sailor? This time, I'll be first mate and you can be Columbus.

N: All eyes turn to the TV: SARAH BECKETT IN CLOSE UP.
C: SARAH
D: "This is a world full of war, famine, poverty, homelessness... and people make a fuss because two men or two women want to live together, or make love. Seems kind of silly, doesn't it?"

C: JOE
D: And Walter Kenton knew the lesions on your face and arms were caused by AIDS?
N: The witness: MARIA TORRES, Hispanic, 35, healthy-looking.
C: MARIA
D: Definitely. People were going around, whispering things. I figured I didn't have anything to lose, so I told all the partners.
C: JOE
D: How did Walter Kenton treat you, after you told him you had AIDS?
N: CLOSE ON KENTON, looking confident.
C: MARIA
D: Every time he came into contact with me, he'd get this look on his face. I called it, the "Oh God" expression. As in "Oh God, here comes that woman with AIDS."
N: Andrew LAUGHS.
C: JOE
D: Ms. Torres? Have your employers fired you for having AIDS?
C: MARIA
D: No. When I need time off, for medical reasons, we work it out.
C: JOE
D: Thank you. No more questions.
N: Jerome Green rises.
C: JEROME GREEN
D: Miss Torres. How did you contract the AIDS virus?
C: MARIA
D: During a transfusion. I lost a lot of blood giving birth to my second child.
C: JEROME GREEN
D: In other words, in your case you happen to be an innocent victim of the AIDS tragedy.
C: MARIA
D: Look. I'm no different from everyone else who has this disease: I'm not guilty, I'm not innocent. I'm just trying to survive.
T: QUICK CUT TO:
S: JOE, APPROACHING A WITNESS (INT./DAY) ...
C: JOE
D: Beyond noticing the marks on his face, were there other things about his appearance that made you suspect he had AIDS?
N: THE WITNESS: Paralegal Anthea Burton.

C: ANTHEA
D: Sorry.

C: ANTHEA
D: Is that a question?
C: JOE
D: No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
C: ANTHEA
D: Yes.
N: Wheeler shakes his head, disgusted. Kenton fumes, outraged. Seidman looks surprised.
C: JOE
D: In what way?
C: ANTHEA
D: Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
C: JOE
D: Your earrings?
N: Anthea is wearing large, dangling African-style earrings.
C: ANTHEA
D: Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
C: JOE
D: What did you say?
C: ANTHEA
D: I said my earrings are American. They're African-American.

N: ANGLE ON THE JURY: Several JURORS write in notebooks like the Marine's; he's been handing them out... Joe seems ill at ease today, a little off his game. When he glances at Andrew, it's with irritation.

C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Hold it, hold it!
N: Andrew trains his attention on Joe.
C: BELINDA
D: Objection! Where has this come from?! Suddenly Counsel is attacking his own witness. Mr. Collins' sexual orientation has absolutely no relevance to this case.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: I said, HOLD IT! Mr. Miller. Could you kindly share with me exactly what's going on in your brain, because I don't have a clue at the moment.
E: the courtroom QUIETS
N: Joe faces Andrew, also curious to know what Joe's up to.
C: JOE
D: Your Honor, everyone in this courtroom is thinking about sexual preference, sexual orientation, whatever you want to call it. They're looking at me, and wondering about it... They're looking at Mr. Beckett, and wondering about it. They're looking at Mr. Wheeler and wondering about it. They might even be looking at you and wondering about it. So, let's get it out in the open. Let's talk about what this case is really about: the general public's hatred... our loathing, our fear of homosexuals.

C: ANDREW
D: Very good.
E: to himself
N: CLOSE ON BELINDA CONINE. CLOSE ON CHARLES WHEELER. CLOSE ON MIGUEL. CLOSE ON WALTER KENTON. CLOSE ON BOB SEIDMAN. CLOSE ON THE MARINE JUROR. CLOSE ON JAMEY COLLINS, sweating bullets on the stand.

The MARINE JUROR whistles while he pees (a classic rock tune, like "Radar Love.") The BUSINESSMAN sighs, "Ahhhhhh." The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change. The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary organ. This does not escape the MARINE'S notice.
C: ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
D: I have some gay friends. What's the biggie?
E: innocently, to Marine
N: The MARINE says nothing.
C: ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
D: Everybody has a couple of gay friends. Don't you?
E: CONT.
C: MARINE
D: No, sir. I do not.
N: The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see his private parts.

C: JOE
D: Any women on board?
N: Kenton glances at the MARINE JUROR.
C: KENTON
D: Not when I was in the Navy.
C: JOE
D: So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal instincts... Anything going on?
C: KENTON

D: You had one guy "like that?"
E: to Kenton
C: KENTON
D: Yeah. But we took care of him.
C: JOE
D: How did you do that?
C: KENTON
D: We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
N: LAUGHTER and SOME APPLAUSE from some SPECTATORS, and some JURORS. ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS. The JUDGE POUNDS HIS GAVEL.
C: JOE
D: You taught him a lesson.
C: KENTON
D: Yes, we did.
C: JOE
D: Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson?
C: BELINDA
D: Objection!
C: JOE
D: I'll withdraw. You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
E: moving on quickly
C: KENTON
D: She didn't try to conceal it.
C: JOE
D: So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
C: KENTON
D: I know the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
C: JOE
D: But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
C: KENTON
D: I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.

C: MIGUEL
D: Maybe you should think about it.
E: low
C: ANDREW
D: What's that mean?!
C: MIGUEL
D: Maybe you should think about it.
E: very difficult
N: A MOMENT.
C: ANDREW
D: I'm not going to die.
C: MIGUEL
D: That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
C: ANDREW
D: You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims?
C: MIGUEL
D: Then, what are we, Drew?! The winners? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!

N: A MAN dressed as LA TOYA JACKSON (with fake snake) squeezes past Joe, reaching for a beer.
C: LA TOYA
D: 'Scuse me, darling.
N: Andrew is SMILING at Joe.
C: JOE
D: You think I'm uncomfortable...
C: ANDREW
D: Correct.
C: JOE
D: You're right.
N: Joe spills beer down his shirt.
C: ANDREW
D: Thank you.
N: CUT TO A SERIES OF PARTY MOMENTS OVER LOUD MUSIC: --Andrew and Miguel ROCKING to HEAVY METAL MUSIC, playing a battle of the guitars. At one point, Andrew has to sit down, but he doesn't stop "playing," while Miguel jumps all around him. --Joe talking to a MAN DRESSED AS MARIE ANTOINETTE:
C: MARIE ANTOINETTE
D: I'm an accountant. What do you do?
C: JOE
D: I'm a lawyer. That's my wife!
E: points to Lisa
N: --Andrew's mother Sarah, as Marge Simpson, delivers a tray of hors d'oeuvres to Joe (standing next to a POLICEMAN):
C: SARAH
D: Have a cocktail wienie.
C: JOE
D: Thanks, Sarah. Nice costume.
E: to the POLICEMAN
C: POLICEMAN
D: It's not a costume, I just got off work. You're cute.
C: JOE
D: That's my wife. Want to see a picture of my baby?
E: pointing to Lisa
C: POLICEMAN
D: Absolutely. Want to see a picture of my baby?
E: reaching for his wallet
N: --Everyone SLOW DANCES to the Talking Heads tune "Heaven" (Simply Red cover version): Joe and Lisa, Andrew and Miguel, Rachel with a sleepy Amy in her arms, the POLICEMAN and TYRONE, Sarah Beckett and MARIE ANTOINETTE, LA TOYA and her snake. "HEAVEN" CONTINUES OVER: A CAB IDLING IN THE STREET, LISA KISSING JOE (NIGHT).
C: JOE
D: I'll see you in an hour, max.
C: LISA
D: Night, honey.
N: Lisa climbs into the cab which she is sharing with the NUN and MARIE ANTOINETTE and LA TOYA.
C: NUN/MARIE ANTOINETTE/LA TOYA
D: Night, Joe!
N: "HEAVEN" CONTINUES OVER: QUIET IN ANDREW'S CONDO, THE PARTY LONG OVER (INT/NIGHT). Joe opens his briefcase, removing a legal pad with notes.
C: ANDREW
D: Congratulations, Miller.
N: Andrew clears away party debris from the table, making space for his legal work. He is attached to an IV line, which is connected to a drip bag on a rolling stand, that can move with him. He is no longer in costume.
C: ANDREW
D: You survived your first gay party intact.
E: CONT.
C: JOE
D: Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
C: ANDREW
D: Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
C: JOE
D: Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
N: Joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:
C: JOE
D: When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Uh huh...
E: distracted
C: JOE
D: Beckett?
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Charles. Okay. Miller?
C: JOE
D: What?
C: ANDREW
D: Do you... pray?
N: Joe hesitates. They're having a personal conversation?
C: JOE
D: Yeah. Sure.
N: Joe goes back to the notes:
C: JOE
D: Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: What have you prayed for?
C: JOE
D: For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
C: ANDREW
D: There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
E: no self-pity
C: JOE
D: I've considered that.
C: ANDREW
D: What happens?
C: JOE
D: We proceed, representing your estate.
C: ANDREW
D: I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
C: JOE
D: I know a good probate lawyer.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks. Do you like opera?
E: a beat
N: Andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him.
C: JOE
D: Opera?
C: ANDREW
D: Want to hear my favorite aria?
C: JOE
D: Opera?
N: SUDDENLY, AN ARIA BY MARIA CALLAS FILLS THE ROOM -- startling Joe with its VOLUME.
C: ANDREW
D: Andrea Chenier, by Giordano. This is Madeleine. She's telling how, during the French revolution, a mob set fire to her house. Her mother died, saving her.
E: over the MUSIC
N: "I look... The place that cradled me was burning!" Do you hear the heartache in her voice? Then, here come the strings. Everything changes. The music fills with hope. Madeleine says... Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed.
C: ANDREW
D: "It was during that sorrow that love came to me!
E: CONT.
N: A voice filled with harmony That said... Live still, I am Life!" "I am the god that descends From the heavens to the earth To make of the earth A heaven!" ANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable.
C: ANDREW
D: "I am Oblivion! I am Glory! I am Love, Love, Love!"
E: CONT.
N: The MUSIC ENDS. Joe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase organizing his notes.
C: JOE
D: I think I'll... I told Lisa.
N: Andrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair.
C: ANDREW
D: Right.
N: Andrew follows Joe to the door.
C: ANDREW
D: I'll look over the Q and A.
E: CONT. businesslike
C: JOE
D: You're ready, don't worry.
N: An awkward moment, both men standing with their hands at their sides -- will one of them initiate a handshake? Joe gives a little "salute," then leaves.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: JOE COMES DOWN THE HALLWAY OF THE MODERN CONDO BUILDING
S: (INT./NIGHT) ...
C: JOE
D: Jesus.
N: Suddenly, Joe HEARS: OPERA MUSIC PLAYING AGAIN. He pauses, listening.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: ANDREW MOVES THROUGH THE ROOM, DRINKING IN THE BEAUTIFUL, passionate MUSIC (INT./NIGHT) ... The IV stand catches against the sofa, tugging the line. Andrew pulls the line out of his arm. He moves, freer now.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: JOE STANDS OUTSIDE ANDREW'S DOOR, OPERA MUSIC PLAYING
S: (INT./NIGHT) ...
N: Joe lifts his hand to KNOCK. He changes his mind.
C: JOE
D: Fucking guy...
N: Joe moves down the corridor, rings for the elevator.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: ANDREW MOVING THROUGH SHADOWS, IN THE APARTMENT, LETTING THE MUSIC pull him along (INT./NIGHT) ...
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: JOE STEPPING INTO THE ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT).
N: The doors closing.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: ANDREW AND THE MUSIC (INT./NIGHT).
N: MUSIC FADING, CROSSES THE CUT TO: EXTERIOR: JOE'S SUBURBAN HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT... Joe crosses the yard to his dark house. MUSIC DISTANT, CROSSES THE CUT TO:
S: JOE'S BABY LIES SLEEPING IN HER CRIB (INT./NIGHT).
N: Joe looks down on the baby, adjusting the blanket.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: LISA FACES CAMERA, ASLEEP IN THE DARK BEDROOM (INT./NIGHT).
N: Joe doffs his jacket, sinking quietly onto the edge of the bed, careful not to disturb Lisa. With his BACK TO CAMERA, Joe puts his head into his hands... And begins to weep.
T: FADE OUT.
N: FADE IN: PANORAMIC SHOT OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS...
T: CUT TO:
S: HIGH, WIDE ANGLE ON THE COURTROOM, IN SILENCE (INT./DAY) ...
N: Andrew moves very slowly with his cane across the courtroom, toward the witness stand. --JUDGE GARNETT crosses his arms, waiting. --JOE glances at some notes. --MIGUEL and SARAH BECKETT look on anxiously. --WHEELER and the others observe in silence. CAMERA HOLDS ON BIBLE BEING CARRIED IN GLOVED HANDS, ACROSS THE COURTROOM. OVER THIS SHOT IS A... TITLE: "Plaintiff's case. day fourteen." The BAILIFF places the Bible in front of Andrew (a purple blotch is showing in front of Andrew's ear.)
C: BAILIFF
D: Place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand.
N: Andrew places his hand on the Bible.
C: BAILIFF
D: "Do you swear to tell the truth...
T: DIALOGUE OVERLAP AND DISSOLVE TO:
S: ANDREW ANSWERING A QUESTION AN HOUR OR SO LATER (INT./DAY).
C: ANDREW
D: Wyant Wheeler had aggressively recruited me. They were the most prestigious firm in Philadelphia, full of opportunity. And I was impressed by the partners.
C: JOE
D: Including Charles Wheeler?
N: (Andrew frequently wipes sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. His voice is hoarse, raspy.)
C: ANDREW
D: Particularly, Charles.
N: ANGLE ON WHEELER.
C: JOE
D: What impressed you about him?
C: ANDREW
D: He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
C: JOE
D: What kind of person is that?
C: ANDREW
D: Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street. The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
E: a smile
N: Belinda Conine MAKES A NOTE ABOUT THAT.
C: JOE
D: Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
C: ANDREW
D: It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
C: JOE
D: You didn't look then, the way you look now?
N: REVERSE -- ON ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND, BUT NOW HE LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT (The healthy. pre-AIDS Andrew.)
C: ANDREW
D: No. I was thirty pounds heavier. I was athletic.
C: JOE
D: A regular all-American guy?
C: ANDREW
D: I suppose you could say that.
C: JOE
D: Except... you were gay?
C: ANDREW
D: I still am.
N: SPECTATORS CHUCKLE.
C: JOE
D: In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
C: ANDREW
D: No. I didn't.
C: JOE
D: Can you explain why you didn't?
C: ANDREW
D: You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to have a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
N: IMAGE: WHEELER. ANDREW. SEIDMAN. OTHERS IN A LOCKER ROOM OF
S: A TENNIS CLUB, WEARING TOWELS, ENTERING A SAUNA (INT./DAY).
C: WHEELER
D: Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
C: ANDREW
D: I'm seeing him this afternoon.
N: INSIDE THE SAUNA: CAMERA PANS SEVERAL MEN.
C: ANDREW
D: "Somebody started telling jokes."
E: VOICE OVER
C: FIRST MAN
D: What do you call a woman who has PMS and ESP at the same time?.
C: SECOND MAN
D: What?
C: FIRST MAN
D: A bitch who knows everything.
N: LAUGHTER. Andrew keeps his eyes closed, leaning against the wall of the sauna, next to Wheeler, relaxing.
C: CHARLES WHEELER
D: How does a faggot fake an orgasm?
N: Andrew opens one eye.
C: CHARLES WHEELER
D: He spits on your back.
E: CONT.
C: SEIDMAN
D: Charles, that's revolting!
N: All the men LAUGH, and Wheeler LAUGHS THE HARDEST.
C: JOE
D: How did that make you feel?
E: VOICE OVER
N: IMAGE: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND (And it's the sick, thin Andrew with AIDS).
C: ANDREW
D: Relieved. That I'd never told him I was gay. Very relieved.
N: ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER: shakes his head, a denial.
C: JOE
D: Are you a good lawyer?
C: ANDREW
D: I'm an excellent lawyer.
C: JOE
D: What makes you an excellent lawyer?
C: ANDREW
D: I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
C: JOE
D: What do you love about it?
C: ANDREW
D: Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
T: CUT TO:
S: BELINDA CONINE STANDS BEFORE ANDREW (INT./DAY).
C: BELINDA
D: You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
C: ANDREW
D: Something like that.
C: BELINDA
D: Do you take risks?
C: ANDREW
D: In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
C: BELINDA
D: In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
C: ANDREW
D: Not unnecessary ones.
C: BELINDA
D: Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
N: Joe cringes a little with discomfort.
C: ANDREW
D: A few times.

N: Andrew steps into the booth.
C: ANDREW
D: Now what do we do?
E: CONT.
N: Robert laughs, closing the door of the booth.
C: ROBERT
D: I think we'll figure it out.
S: BACK TO THE COURTROOM (INT./DAY):
N: Joe sits with a stone-sober expression: this isn't easy.
C: BELINDA
D: When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
C: ANDREW
D: I guess it was 1984, 85.
C: BELINDA
D: Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
C: ANDREW
D: It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
C: BELINDA
D: But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
C: ANDREW
D: That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
C: BELINDA
D: You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?
C: ANDREW
D: I'd heard of something. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
N: CLOSE SHOT ON ANDREW -- losing strength.
C: BELINDA
D: Do you need a break?
E: OS sounds far away
C: ANDREW
D: No.
C: BELINDA
D: While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
C: ANDREW
D: That is not correct. I never lied about it.
C: BELINDA
D: Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
C: ANDREW
D: No.
C: BELINDA
D: Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
N: IMAGE: ANDREW IN BOB SEIDMAN'S OFFICE, WORKING, SPOTTING A
S: PHOTO ON THE WALL OF BOB'S WIFE AND CHILDREN (INT./DAY).
C: ANDREW
D: Some do. I didn't.
C: BELINDA
D: As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
C: ANDREW
D: In some situations.
C: BELINDA
D: Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
C: JOE
D: Objection!
C: BELINDA
D: I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
N: ANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah.
C: ANDREW
D: Yes.
C: BELINDA
D: You could have infected him, isn't that right?
C: ANDREW
D: Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
C: BELINDA
D: Really?
C: ANDREW
D: Yes.
N: Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead.
C: BELINDA
D: You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
C: ANDREW
D: That's right.
C: BELINDA
D: And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
C: ANDREW
D: Absolutely.
C: BELINDA
D: Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
C: ANDREW
D: One. Here, in front of my ear.
N: An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it before Andrew.
C: BELINDA
D: Remembering you are under oath, answering truthfully, can you see the lesion on your face, in this mirror, three feet away? Answering truthfully.
N: Andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is NOT very visible.
C: ANDREW
D: By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
C: BELINDA
D: Answer the question, please.
C: ANDREW
D: No. I can't really see it.
C: BELINDA
D: Thank you.
N: Andrew rubs his eyes.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: This would be a good time to break for the day...
E: OS far away
C: JOE
D: Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
E: OS far away

D: Beckett?
E: OS far away
N: Andrew finds the Judge looking at him.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Can you go on for ten minutes?
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Yes sir.
N: Joe JUMPS UP from the plaintiff's table.
C: JOE
D: I only need five! May I?
E: to Belinda, reaching for the mirror
N: Joe approaches Andrew, with the mirror.
C: JOE
D: Do you have any lesions on any part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Yes. On my torso.
C: JOE
D: If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we're talking about.
C: BELINDA
D: We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
C: JOE
D: Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's see what we're talking about.
N: ANGLE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY -- LOOKING APPREHENSIVE.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: I'll allow it. Would you mind removing your shirt, Mr. Beckett?
E: a moment, then
N: ANGLE ON MIGUEL -- TENSE.
C: ANDREW
D: Allright.
N: The COURTROOM TURNS SILENT. Andrew removes his suit jacket. He's weak, so the smallest gesture requires effort. ANGLE ON BOB SEIDMAN -- WATCHING. Andrew undoes his tie. ANGLE ON THE MARINE JUROR -- WATCHING. Andrew unbuttons his collar buttons, working his way down. ANGLE ON SARAH BECKETT -- WATCHING. Andrew stands, pulling his shirttails out of his trousers. ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER -- WATCHING. Andrew removes his shirt -- THERE ARE PURPLE BLOTCHES SPLAYED ACROSS HIS CHEST AND ABDOMEN AND ARMS. The SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR GASPS. Sarah Beckett is silently crying. The LESBIAN JUROR closes her eyes.
C: JOE
D: Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
C: ANDREW
D: Yes.
C: JOE
D: Thank you.
N: CAMERA MOVES IN ON CHARLES WHEELER...
T: CUT TO:
S: COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, ACTIVITY (INT./DAY) ...
N: Charles Wheeler strides down the corridor, flanked by Kenton, Killcoyne and Belinda, discussing strategy. Bob Seidman steps to Wheeler's side, keeping pace.
C: SEIDMAN
D: I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
C: WHEELER
D: ... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. What, Bob?
E: to Belinda to Seidman
C: SEIDMAN
D: No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
N: NOW he's got EVERYONE'S attention.
C: SEIDMAN
D: The system automatically makes a backup.
E: CONT.
N: Belinda holds up both hands, interrupting with:
C: BELINDA
D: I don't think I should hear this.
N: She walks away, giving a glance over her shoulder as:
C: SEIDMAN
D: You can erase the backup... But why would you?
E: a challenge to Wheeler
C: KENTON
D: What's the point, Bob?
E: venomous
C: WHEELER
D: Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
E: calm
C: SEIDMAN
D: Charles...
E: weary
C: WHEELER
D: If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
N: Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the high-ceilinged corridor. Belinda hesitates, before re-grouping with Wheeler and the rest, casting a curious glance toward Bob Seidman.
T: CUT TO:
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM CHARLES WHEELER -- ON THE STAND...
C: BELINDA
D: Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett to your firm?
N: Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate. Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity.
C: WHEELER
D: If you're the owner of a major league ball club, you recruit the hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously promising as a young attorney. That's why we went after him, that's why we hired him, and that's why we stuck with him, year after year... waiting for the promise to be fulfilled. But it never was.
C: BELINDA
D: You kept giving him another chance?
C: WHEELER
D: Of course we did. When you've groomed someone they way we groomed Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all kinds of special treatment on him... you've made quite an investment. We were waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver. But, ultimately, we could no longer ignore the gap between the promise and the reality... This is one of the saddest times in my life. To sit in this court, testifying to Andy's ultimate failure to make the grade. To discover that he is one of those people who wants to benefit by the system, but doesn't want to play by the system's rules. To think you know someone, only to find out... you don't know them at all. It's heartbreaking.
C: BELINDA
D: Thank you. That's all for now, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Mr. Miller?
N: Joe rises. Adjusts his jacket. Wheeler waits.
C: JOE
D: Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? Not about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
E: very gentle
C: WHEELER
D: Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
N: Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing difficult. He takes in the rest of the court, while Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH THE AIR...
C: WHEELER
D: Andy worked when he wanted to work, telling us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle...
E: CONT.
N: ANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get the feeling she's giving her testimony).
C: RACHEL
D: I didn't mind covering for Andy, but I did wonder... when was he planning to deal with his problem?
N: Andrew blinks... what's going on? Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler. Everything seems normal.
C: WHEELER
D: Sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people.
C: JOE
D: What kind of people?
C: WHEELER
D: People who want to bend the rules...
N: ANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table:
C: KILLCOYNE
D: If you want to be a leader in this society, you have to make certain sacrifices.
N: Wheeler keeps speaking:
C: WHEELER
D: ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
N: ANDREW'S POV -- WALTER KENTON:
C: KENTON
D: You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
C: JOE
D: Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler? You?
N: ANDREW'S POV -- BOB SEIDMAN:
C: SEIDMAN
D: Yes, I did see the lesions. I suspected he was sick...
N: CLOSE ON ANDREW: closing his eyes. THE VOICES GET LOUDER, FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER:
C: WHEELER
D: The everyday, common person with decent values...
C: RACHEL
D: It seems like he wasn't willing to face the reality of his situation...
N: Andrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER:
C: SEIDMAN
D: I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
C: WHEELER
D: ... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
C: SEIDMAN
D: ... But we shouldn't have fired him...
C: WHEELER
D: ... It's time to get this society back on track!
N: Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV: The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned. ANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor. Andrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion. He lies on the floor, looking up. ANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him.
C: ANDREW
D: Could you call an ambulance, please?
T: CUT TO:
S: A CRISIS IN A HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./DAY) ... MEDICAL STAFF
N: working frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The tube they're trying to put in place seems to be making matters worse. Miguel stands to the side, furious:
C: MIGUEL
D: It's making it worse. Take it out. Take it out!
N: Dr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes, obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and Andrew GASPS for breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over Andrew's face and he drinks in the air. His eyes are wide open with fear, sweat covering his face.

C: ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
D: He sounded pretty smart to me.
C: BUSINESSMAN JUROR
D: Why would they fire him? Why not a medical leave, or...
C: COLLEGE STUDENT JUROR
D: They freaked out over the AIDS.
C: SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR
D: They hate homosexuals.
C: BUSINESSMAN JUROR
D: It's not against the law to disapprove of homosexuals.
C: LESBIAN JUROR
D: It is against the law to fire someone for having AIDS. That's why we're here.
C: BUSINESSMAN JUROR
D: You're the foreman. You haven't said anything. What do you think?
N: ANGLE ON -- THE MARINE, sitting at the head of the table. CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON HIM:
C: MARINE JUROR
D: They're saying he wasn't a good lawyer. He was mediocre. And the fact that they gave him the most important lawsuit they'd ever had, for one of their most important clients... they say that doesn't prove anything, because that was just a test. What did they call it? A carrot. To see if he'd rise to the occasion... Okay... Say I've got to send a pilot into enemy territory, and he's gonna be flying a plane that cost 350 million dollars... Who am I going to put into that plane? A rookie who can't cut the grade, because I want to see if he'll rise to the challenge? Or am I going to give that assignment to my best pilot, my most experienced, my sharpest, my top gun... The very best I've got?
N: CLOSE ON THE MARINE:
C: MARINE JUROR
D: Could somebody please explain that to me... like I'm a six year old?
E: CONT.
N: HOLD ON THE MARINE, AS THE JUDGE'S VOICE FADES IN:
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
E: VO
T: AND CUT TO:
S: THE COURTROOM -- NO ONE STIRRING (INT./DAY).
N: Joe is utterly cool. Sitting beside Andrew's empty chair. Among the spectators, Andrew's siblings, Jill, Matt, Randy, and his parents, Bud and Sarah... Rachel, Anthea and Miguel's sister Maria. The Marine rises to his feet.
C: MARINE
D: We have, Your Honor...
N: Charles Wheeler looks the Marine in the eye.
C: MARINE
D: We find for the plaintiff, Andrew Beckett.
E: CONT.
N: Joe smiles, just barely, remaining calm. Charles Wheeler whispers to Belinda Conine.
C: JUDGE GARNETT
D: Have you awarded any damages?
C: MARINE
D: Yes, we have, Your Honor. For back pay and loss of benefits ... one hundred fortythree thousand dollars.
E: referring to a list
N: Joe shakes his head, disappointed, writing down the amount. Wheeler and his crew SMILE -- THIS IS THEIR VICTORY.
C: MARINE JUROR
D: For damages related to mental anguish and humiliation... we give no award.
E: CONT.
N: Joe is extremely disappointed.
C: MARINE JUROR
D: And punitive damages we award... Four million, eight hundred and eighty two thousand dollars.
E: CONT.
N: Joe throws his pen over his shoulder. COURTROOM BURSTS INTO AN UPROAR. Andrew's supporters, Joe's colleagues from his office rush forward, pounding him on the back. Andrew's family members hug each other... CAMERA CRANES AWAY FROM THIS GROUP, RISING TOWARD THE CEILING AS THE SOUNDS OF THE CROWD FADE... OPERA MUSIC FADES IN, TAKING US TO... ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING... JOE STEPPING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF a hospital (INT./NIGHT), carrying two shopping bags from the Famous 4th Street deli... Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room. Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them, entering Andrew's room, he hears:
C: DR. GILLMAN
D: ... if he comes out of the hospital this time, you mustn't expect him to be like he was before...
N: Joe steps into...
S: ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ...
N: A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed: "Victory." OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face. JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand, smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various parts of his body.) Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV. JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it. As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others. People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and happiness evident in the room. ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile. ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look. Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he wants Joe to sit there. Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed. With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His voice is raspy, weak:
C: ANDREW
D: What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
C: JOE
D: What?
C: ANDREW
D: A good start.
N: Joe smiles.
C: ANDREW
D: Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
E: CONT.
C: JOE
D: It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome. Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
E: sees the oxygen mask
N: Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears.
C: JOE
D: I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
E: CONT.
C: ANDREW
D: Sure thing.
E: muffled by the mask
N: Joe stands.
C: JOE
D: I'll see you, Beckett.
N: Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes are dancing.
C: ANDREW
D: Thanks for coming by.
E: through mask
C: JOE
D: You bet. We'll see you later.
N: Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there.
C: JOE
D: He's looking good. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets out of here soon.
E: to Miguel
C: MIGUEL
D: We just want to get him home. Thanks for stopping by, Joe.
N: Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps Miguel's back.
C: JOE
D: Night.
N: Joe leaves. Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying:
C: MIGUEL
D: He's tired. He ought to sleep.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
S: JOE STEPPING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT), AND
N: saying to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES:
C: JOE
D: What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
N: The elevator doors close.
T: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
N: ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM... Matt gives Andrew's hand a squeeze, before leaving.
C: MATT
D: Night, Andy. See you tomorrow, buddy.
N: Rev. Jim pats Andrew's shoulder.
C: REV. JIM
D: God bless you, Andy.
N: Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek.
C: BUD
D: Goodnight, son. Get some rest, okay?
N: Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead.
C: SARAH
D: Goodnight angel, my sweet boy...
N: Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug his brother. He begins to sob.
C: RANDY
D: Andy.
N: Andrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected, around his brother Randy, to comfort him.
C: ANDREW
D: I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow.
E: through mask
N: Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room. Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door. Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes. Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the remote control, and TURNS ON THE TV. Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say:
C: ANDREW
D: I'm ready...
C: MIGUEL
D: Ready for what, baby?
C: ANDREW
D: Whatever.
C: MIGUEL
D: I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
N: Andrew replaces the oxygen mask. They lie next to each other, watching television.
T: FADE OUT/FADE IN:
N: EXTERIOR: JOE'S HOUSE AT NIGHT, ESTABLISHING... From inside the house: the phone rings.
T: CUT TO:
S: JOE AND LISA'S DARK BEDROOM, QUIET (INT./NIGHT) ...
N: Lisa is sitting up in bed, having answered the phone. Joe is just waking up.
C: LISA
D: It's Miguel.
E: to Joe
N: Joe sits bolt upright.
C: JOE
D: Miguel?
T: CUT TO:
N: EXTERIOR: ANDREW AND MIGUEL'S LOFT BUILDING, DAY. A TAXI ARRIVES and an elegant, well-dressed older COUPLE step out.
T: CUT TO:
N: RACHEL OPENS THE DOOR OF THE LOFT, FINDING MIGUEL'S FAMILY on the other side: very dignified, handsome people who have just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where... A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying as they hug each other. Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew at various stages of his life, and things that meant something to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his favorite cat, etc. THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the music ("You're Miguel's parents?" "Do you remember when Andy..." "I went to college with Andy..." etc.) Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet. Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises, extending his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his head in sadness, reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for an embrace. CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEMING TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING... CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone... AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the images are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video... THE HOME MOVIES FEATURE a bright-eyed LITTLE BOY... Andrew... Riding a bike with training wheels... Swinging wildly at a wiffle ball... AS CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE TV, PARTY SOUNDS AND THEME MUSIC FADES... People are still talking, still laughing, still crying, but we CAN'T HEAR THEM ANY LONGER. Instead... We hear only the SOUNDTRACK from the HOME MOVIES... Andrew SHOUTING GLEEFULLY as he chases a new puppy... Andrew SQUEALING as he jumps into a tiny swimming pool... Andrew on a swing, going higher and higher... And laughing.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: ROLL END CREDITS. May we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that we cannot fill them with love and warmth...
