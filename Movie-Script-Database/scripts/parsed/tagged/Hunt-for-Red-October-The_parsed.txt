C: SUPER: POLWARNY INLET
D: Soviet Submarine Base on the Barents Sea 500 mi north of Murmansk Ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of Captain First Rank in the Soviet Navy. Behind him, out of sight, someone SPEAKS:

C: PUTIN
D: Ah,, Captain, every time I climb that ladder, I realize what an over-fed ox rve become. Put in smiles. Ramius smiles back, but his eyes are cold. Suddenly, there's not a lot of Lave on the bridge:
N: PUTIN (CONT'D) (EXPANSIVELY) Such a glorious day. So exciting to h t ally put the land behind us and be on our way. (TO RAMIUS) Bourgeois of me, I know, but my enthusiasm at being chosen polidcica]. officer on this historic mission Its me with pride. (BEAT) Me, a man of such humble birth, whose father was only a mill. worker. Think of it, comrades, a mill worker. Borodin CHUCKLES. Putin stares at him. Borodin covers with a COUGH. Putin keeps starring. Flushed, Borodin looks away. Putin turns porcine eyes on Ramius: PUTIN (CONT'D) (TURNING) Your father was a Lithuanian, was he not, Captain?
C: RAMIUS
D: You know he was.
C: PU TIN
D: I knew a Lithuanian once... His words hang like rotten fru

C: SALLY
D: Daddy?
N: RYAN (TURNING) Hey.., What are you doing up? You're suppose to be sleeping.
C: SALLY
D: I can't. Kneeing beside: her, Ryan talks in a steady unpatronizing way. He loves her to death:
C: RYAN
D: What's the matter?
C: SALLY
D: Where are you going?
C: RYAN
D: I have to go on a business trip and you have to go to sleep or when you grow up you'll only be two inches tall.
C: SALLY
D: Stanley keeps waking me up. Stanley is Sally's bear. Ryan talks to it like it was alive. it makes Sally grin.
C: RYAN
D: What's the matter, Stanley? Are you nuts or something?
C: SALLY
D: He's not, nuts. He's lonely.
N: (SLYLY) He needs a brother. If he had a brother then he could go to sleep better. Before Ryan can answer, a ravishing woman in her ..late-twenties marches into the study. She is
C: MARGARET RYAN

D: Won't do me any good ---
C: MARGARET
D: Jack.
N: RYAN (SHEEPISH) OK. I ll try. Taking the pil3s, he kisses her again. All of a sudden, he wants to climb inside, park someplace and steam the windows. Her smile is ALL KNOWING: " MARGARET You only have three minutes. RYAN (GIG) Hey.. If I'm lucky, might miss the damn plane altogether.

C: GREER
D: All right, what's important enough to get you on a . plane in the middle of the night?
E: CONT'D
T: JUMP CUT TO:
C: A PAIR OF PHOTOGRAPHS
D: dropping onto the tihle in front of Greer. They show the bow and stern of a submarine in dry dock. From the size of the construction crey, it's obvious the boat is huge.
C: RYAN
D: British Intelligence received these two days ago. She's the Red October. The Soviet's newest typhoon.
C: GREER
D: Jesus. The Brits actually got a man into the construction shed?
N: RYAN (DROPPING MORE
C: PHOTOS)
D: This pair was digitally enhanced for line resolution. This one for color.
C: RYAN
D: Twelve meters longer than the normal typhoon, three meters wider. The captain's name is Ramixts.
C: GREER
D: One of yours?
C: RYAN
D: Yes, sir. I did the bio on him last year. He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for ten years. Fairly good political connections. He's also trained most of their attack boat skippers. They can him the Vilnius schoolmaster. Greer studies one of the photos with a magnifying glass. Something captures his attention:
C: GREER
D: What are these doors?
C: RYAN
D: The doors, Admiral, are the problem. I don't know what they are and neither do the English.
N: (SIPPING CAFFEE) it's just pole our friends at the Ustinov Design Bureau have come up with something new. (BEAT) With your permission, I'd like to show these to someone. Do you know Skip Tyler?
C: GREER
D: Sub driver. Did he get hurt or something?
N: RYAN (NODDING) He was Captain on an attack boat. Got clipped by a drunk driver and lost a leg. Now he's teaching at the Academy and doing some consulting for Underwater Systems Command. GREER
C: GREER
D: When .do you want to talk to him?
C: RYAN
D: Right now if it's OX with you? 've. never met him personally, but -
C: GREER
D: I'll take care of it.
N: (PICKING UP
C: THE PHONE)
D: Margie, have a car for Dr. Ryan at the front gate in tan. minutes. Ryan retrieves his photographs. Getting Up, Greer watches him, choosing his words carefully:
C: GREER
D: One of our satellites caught Red October in Polijarny Inlet this morning.
E: CONT'D
N: RYAN (SHOCKED) They shouldn't have been sea ready for weeks. Ryan closes his case. Greer walks him to the door:
C: GREER
D: Relax, son. The Navy's got a Las Angeles c'la'ss sittJng right off their doorstep. In a few days we'll know everything about her but the wok's name.
C: RYAN
D: Well, In that case --
N: (GRINNING) Can you tell me where I can buy a bear?
C: GREER
D: For Sally?
N: (RYAN NODS) Same place you buy a baby brgther, I guess.
T: CUT TO:
C: A BANSHEE WAIL
D: in blackness. The groan of a primordial beast echoing in the dark, followed by a deep vibration that rattles bones and shatters eardrums. The black screen is moving. A massive cylinder glides over the top of us like a giant spaceship, outlined by flashes of e1ectxic-blue phosphorenscence.
C: SUPER: USS DALLAS
D: Los Angeles Class Attack Sub 50 mks west of Polijarny Inlet
N: DEPTH: 400 FEET
C: ON THE DALLAS
D: in the sonar shack, a state of the art sonar display glows blue. High tech graphics pinpoint movements in deep water beyond the hull..
N: SEAMAN SECOND CLASS RONALD JONES listens to a headset and eyeballs the display. A college dropout with a genius IQ, Jones is the kind of guy who likes tossing dead cats into crowded cathedrals.
C: SEAMAN CHARLES BEAUMONT
D: unruly red hair, a minion freckles and a wary smile, sits beside Jones. On SPEAKERS in the bulkhead, the PRIMORDIAL HOWL again, MUFFLED, clued with NOISE TRANSIENTS:
N: JONES HEAR I
C: BEAUMONT
D: No. Maybe. It's buried in...
N: JONES (LEADING) Yes?
C: BEAUMONT
D: Surface clutter? I should go to SAPS?
C: JONES
D: Correct, Seaman Beaumont. Surface Affects Processing. There is hope for your small brain yet.
N: (BEAUMONT GRINS) And like Mozart at Saltzburg, you have labored to produce... (ANOTHER HOWL) hiclocdc. BEAUMONT
C: JONES
D: A whale, Beaumont. A whale. A marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do. Beaumont frowns. Appearing in the sonar shack door, directly
N: BEHIND JONES
C: THE COB
D: Chief of the Boat, a barrel-chested bear, smiles at Beaumont:
C: COB
D: He gets to raggin you too bad, kid, you can always ask him about Pavarattt.. Jones sinks into his chair. Beaumont grins. Sea story coming. From the look on Jones' face, it promises to be a good one:
C: BEAUMONT
D: Tell me, Chief.
C: COB
D: Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak, right? And he figures this sonar system is basically just a big old 300 million ddllar stereo unit. So he gets this piece of Pavarmt3i --
E: taking his time
C: JONES
D: it was Paganini.
C: COB
D: Whatever. It's this piece of music he likes so much he wants to share it, right? So he re-wires the computer and figures how to put it in the water with a gigawatt of juice behind it.
N: (BEAT) Now, the Captain, he don't much care. But about twenty-one boats out of San Diego, including one way out at Pearl, starts hearing Pavarotti Doming out their ass. Jonesy has turned the whole fucking Pacific Ocean into a stereo speaker. (LAUGHING) And all of a sudden we got an Admiral in the middle of it and we're writing reports out the yang yang. Beaumont's LAUGHS. Even Jones sm Ies. Then, a flashing light on the. sonar display catches his eye. He starts flipping switches. Beaumont sobers:: up:
C: BEAUMONT
D: What should I --
C: JONES
D: Be sti 1, I got it. Jones works in silence, then punches the intervom:
C: JONES
D: Conn, sonar.
N: VOICE (ON INTERCOM) Captain, aye. What is it Jonesy?
C: JONES
D: Distant contact, submerged bearing zero- nine-seven. It's a wild guess, but I'd say we had a Boomer headed out of the barn.
C: IN THE COMMAND CENTER
D: forward of sonar, sailers drive the ship beneath a maze of pipes and equipment. At the center of the Conn, surrounded by fire control, quartermaster, helm :
C: CAPTAIN BARTOLOMO MANCUSO
D: skipper of the DaZa, early-forties, muscular body encased in a blue jumpsuit, works the intercom on the periscope plat6arm:
C: MANCUSO
D: Start a plot, Jonesy. IM be there in a second. Leaving the deck, Mancuso glances at his executive offker
C: LIEUTENANT PHIL THOMPSON
D: thirties, dark complected, standing at fire control:
C: MANCUSO
D: I'91 be in sonar, PhiL
E: CONT'D
C: IN SONAR
D: Jones is already working on the plot. In font of him on the sonar display, the flashing light is starting to move. Mancuso sticks his head in.
C: MANCUSO
D: What do you have?
T: CUT TO:
C: RAMIUS
D: in Red October's Conn. Much larger than the control center on the Dallas. Leaving the deck, Ramius heads aft, glancing at Borodin:
C: RAMIUS
D: When you see Putin, tell him that when it's convenient, 191 be in my stateroom. Leaving the Conn, Ramius enters
C: A HALLWAY
D: Moving past a radio compartment on his left, Ramius stops at a door,
N: ENTERING THE
C: CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
D: C3osing the door behind him, Ramius turns into the room. Surprised, he sees
C: PU TIN
D: seated at a desk, reading a bible. Startled, Putin looks up:
C: RAMIUS
D: What are you doing?
C: PT TIN
D: It's my responsibility to oversee the stability of the crew, Captain. You know that.
C: RAMIUS
D: And you accomplish this by searching through my papers and invading my privacy?
C: PUTIN
D: There is no such thing as privacy in the Soviet Union, Comrade. It's antithetical to the oal]ective good. Suppressing his anger, Ramius moves to a locker, changing into dungarees. He can fiee]. Putin's weasel eyes crawling up and down his back. Holding the bible, Put in muses:
C: PUTIN
D: You. surprise me, Captain. A man in your position reading trash about the end of the world.
E: CONT'D
N: (READING) "I am coming soon. I will give to each according to his deeds. I am the beginning and the end." (GLANCING UP) Did you underline these passages?
C: RAMIUS
D: The book belonged to my wife. I keep it only for sentimental value.
C: PUTIN
D: Your wife was a beautiful woman. A tragedy her life was cut so short.
N: RAMIUS (TURNING) I assure you, Comrade. There's nothing wrong with my mind.
C: PUTIN
D: Given the amount of fire power on Red October, I'm sure the whole world will. breathe a cm1 eotive sigh of relief.
E: trying to joke
N: RAMIUS (LKE ICE) How many more agents does the KGB have on my boat? PUTIN (STANDING) Captain, this is not your boat. It belongs to the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. You would be well advised to remember that. (RAMIUS BLANCHES) Anyway, I am only a political odfioer. If the KGB has an agent on board, I would be the last to know.
C: RAMIUS
D: I suggest we open our orders.
C: PUTIN
D: As you wish. There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside, another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys. Inside the second safe, a large envelope. it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at Putin; he reads:
C: RAMIUS
D: We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and rendezvous with the Akula submarine, Konovalov.
C: PUTIN
D: Captain Tupalev's boat.
C: RAMIUS
D: You know Tupolav?
C: PU TIN
D: I know that he is descended from a long line of aril rats and that he was a student of yours. it is rumored, he has no love in his heart for you. Why is that? Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup.
C: RAMIUS
D: There is no room in Tupolev's heart for anyone or anything except Tupolev.
N: (READING) Having made contact, we are ordered to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev w2l hunt us while we test our ship. Putting down his tea, Putin stands, suddenly formal, awkwardly OBSEQUIOUS:
C: PUTIN
D: Captain, this is an historic moment for all. of us. I should like to make a request.
C: RAMIUS
D: Before you do, I want to talk to you about something important.
N: PUTIN (NOT HEARING) I know that it is not aooording to protocxrl, but would you permit me to post the orders and inform the crew of our mission? RAMIUS (RESIGNED) As you wash, Comrade. Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him. Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways. Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL in the SHARP corner of the DESK. Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains, using all of his strength until..
C: PUTIN'S NECK SHATTERS
D: and his face goes slack. With surprising gentleness, Ramius lowers the shuddering body to the deck. Carefully, he checks the pulse in Putin's neck. Dying, Putin stares into Ramius' face.
C: RAMIUS
D: I an sorry my friend. But it is cyear to me now. Where I would walk, you cannot fallow. Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body with scalding tea. Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man. Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom and takes a deep breath. Pushing a button, he BELLOWS:
E: CONT'D
C: RAMIUS
D: Dr. Petrov. Come to my quarters at once. There's been an aociderit!
E: CONT'D

C: STEINER
D: Brilliant, Skip. You're one of those guys you can't hide things from, right?
N: Tyler. grits his teeth. Steiner closes the hatch. Across the room, Ryan enters. Spotting Tyler, he moves to the platform, staring at the mini sub. The propeller starts turning. It submerges. TYLER (TURNING) Ryan?
C: RYAN
D: Yes sir. What it that thing?
E: re: mini sub
C: TYLER
D: Deep submergence rescue vehicle.
C: RYAN
D: That's what a DSRV looks like.
C: TYLER
D: That's it. I designed this one. lt's aan d the Mystic.
C: RYAN
D: What are you doing with it? Tyler climbs off the piatfarm, working his cane with practiced precision. Taking Ryan by the arm, he heads for a door:
C: TYLER
D: Rigging it with a generic docking acllar so it will mate with British, German, other kinds of subs.
N: (NODDING) This one here is designed to be super mobile. We can get it anywhere in the world in twenty-four hours. If that lunatic doesn't crash it fast:. (BEAT) Admiral Greer says you have some pdr ures.- -

D: Bigger than a regular typhoon.
N: (SQUINTING) What are these doors? RYAN (GRINNING) You don't miss much, do you? They're too big for torpedo tubes. Could you launch a missile horizontaly?
C: TYLER
D: Could. Question is why would you? Besides, they're symmetrical right straight through the hull.
C: RYAN
D: How about a towed sonar array?
C: TYLER
D: Barely clears the screw in the -- Tyler freezes. Somewhere in that vast abundance of grey matter, a

E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: A what?
C: TYLER
D: Caterpillar drive. Magneto--hydrodynamic propulsion. Like a linear induction motor with saltwater as the ;tat-r. You follow?
N: RYAN (SMILING) Oh sure.
C: TYLER
D: Items like a jet engine for water. Goes in the front, gets squirted out the back. Only, It's got no moving parts, see. So it's' potentially very quiet.
N: RYAN
C: TYLER
D: Try silent If this works, we'll have to find a whole new way to track submarines. Ryan grapples with the implications. Tyler trips down memory lane:
C: TYLER
D: We messed with it. Years ago. Never could make it work. They really built this? This isn't a mock-up or anything?
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: it put to sea this morning.
N: TYLER (SHAKING HIS
C: HEAD)
D: You know when I was eleven years old, I helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in the basement because some fool parked a dozen warheads in Cuba, ninety miles from the Florida coast.
N: (RE: PHOTO) This thing could park two hundred warheads off New York or Washington and nobody'd suspect a thing til it was all over.
C: RYAN
D: Any records of our work on the caterpillar?
N: TYLER (GRABBING HIS
C: CANE)
D: We got an archive. Let's get dusty.

C: RAMIUS
D: We will not.

D: But how can we continue a m scion without a political offcer?
C: RAMIUS
D: For many years the Russian Navy went to sea before there were political offScers, Doctor.
C: PETROV
D: Yes, but -
N: RAMIUS (RE: ORDERS) These orders are quite specific. Putin's unfortunate death wall not change them. Turning, Ramius spots Loginov and waves his hand. Loginov freezes.

D: Making a mistake and...
N: (EXASPERATED) We must report this to Red Meet Command.
C: RAMIUS
D: Impossible. We are ordered to maintain strict radio silence.
N: (TO IOGINOV) That will be all, Comrade. Glad to be anywhere else, Loginov returns to his work.
C: PETROV
D: Captain, perhaps I should keep Putin's key until --
N: RAMIUS (SHARPLY) I suggest you return to sick bay, Doctor. Soon, I will address the crew and explain our orders. This is not a decision for discussion. Shrugging, Petrov disappears. Borodin and Ramius.. follow him. Freaked, Loginov watches them go.

C: IN THE ENLISTED MESS
D: crowded together at tables, men hear Ramius' voice:
N: RAMIUS (VO CONT'D) (ON SPEAKERS) We are to pass quiet as water through every one of the American's sonar nets. Maintaining strict radio. silence, we are to proceed across the Atlantic to the east coast of the United States.
C: IN ENGINEERING

IN THE MISSILE BAYS men are spellbound by their captain's intensity: RAMIUS (VO -CONT'D) (ON SPEAKERS) For many years, we have had to stand helplessly in the wings while poll ns compromise every advance our military has made.
C: BACK IN THE CONN
D: Ramius stands on the periscope platform holding the phone. All eyes are riveted on him :
N: RAMIUS (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) it is politicians who have crippled our armed forces while talking incessantly of peace. And now it is time, comrades, to exchange the cuckoo for a hawk. RAMIUS (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) Our missies will not be armed, of course, but imagine, if they were. In one bright moment, all that we believe in, all that we honor, would prevail forever.

C: BONAVIA
D: St M no sign of Red October, sir. I think we should surface and contact Red Fleet Command.
C: TUPOLEV
D: To what purpose?
C: BONAVIA
D: To inform them Red October has not appeared.
C: TUPOLEV
D: What makes you think she hasn't? Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him, Bonavia's stomach growls.
C: TUPOLEV
D: Has it occurred to you that Red October may already be in position? That Ramius is merely hiding behind his silent drive? Waiting for me to break radio silence and make a fool of myself?
N: BONAVIA (FRUSTRATED) BUT -
C: TUPOLEV
D: I will not break radio silence. We wilt lie here quietly for a few more hours. If Ramius hasn't arrived by then, I'll contact Red Fleet Command.

C: A LOBBY
D: decorated with secretaries and suits, all, in quiet motion. At speed, Ryan trues to keep up with Greer:

N: RYAN (WIDE-EYED) BUT
C: GREER
D: The yeoman'fl have the slides all, laid out. AIL you have to do --
N: Ten feet ahead, Greer realizes Ryan's no longer faUowing. Stopping, he comes back:
C: GREER
D: Look. No one knows this material better than you do. Give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand. He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers and say what you think. Yowll do fine. Come on. Ryan takes a deep breath.
E: CONT'D
T: JUMP CUT TO:
C: RYAN FOLLOWING GREER
D: into the White House Briefing Room. Joint Chiefs are gathered around a thirty foot conference table. Greer introduces Ryan to a GENERAL and an ADMIRAL, then mingles. Left alone, Ryan spot, a lectern at the foot of the tabl. Nearby, a yeoman tends a slide machine, an overhead projector and a large bulletin board. Ryan heads for the lectern. The yeoman has a list of slides, some photos and mustrations. Trying to gather his thoughts, Ryan steps behind the lectern.
C: JEFFREY PELT
D: the President's National Security Advisor arrives. In his mid-mss, wearing wire-rim spectacles, Pelt's nearsighted, brOliant and a crackerjack poker player. Generals and Admirals take their places. Pelt site at the head of the tabl, turning to Greer:
C: PELT
D: Let's get started.
C: GREER
D: Yes, sir. The preliminary briefing today w M be handled by Dr. Jack Ryan. I believe you've seen some of his :work.
N: PELT (TO RYAN) You may begin. Taking a sip of water, Ryan nods at the yeoman. Projector is TURNED ON:
C: RYAN
D: Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity. The first to sail was --
N: (SLIDE) this ship, the Red October. A variant of the typhoon class, she's some six hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two thousand tons submerged displacement, roughly the size of a World War II aircraft Carrier. (BEAT) Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped to fire long-range missiles from Russian waters, Red October carries fifty-six SS-311s, which is a short-range attack mis it with eight independent warheads. That's four hundred forty-eight warheads all spedfically designed to fire close in. (ANOTHER SLIDE) We believe these doors on the bow, and here again on the stern, enclose a magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar, which may allow the sub to run totally silent. (ANOTHER SLIDE) it is possible this new drive system allowed the captain, a man named Marko RAMIUS - Ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board. One is of Ramius alone. The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful woman.
C: RYAN
D: to elude one of ' our attack boats, the Dallas, which trailed Red October f r om harbor this morning.
E: CONT'D
N: (POINTKUY) This drive, if it's working, could render Red October invvsihl8 to our SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic.
C: PELT
D: You would characterize this as a first strike weapon, Dr. Ryan? Ryan glances at Greer. Greer smi reassuringly.
C: RYAN
D: There's no doubt about that, sir. She is designed to approach by stealth, and fire on a target with little or no warning.
C: ADMIRAL
D: An offensive weapon. The kind you start wars with.
C: RYAN
D: Precisely, Admiral..
N: (RE: MAP) if I may continue. Shortly after the Dallas lost contact, there were additional Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad and the Mediterranean. The Soviets have SOME -- (CHECKING NOTES) fifty-eight nuclei submarines headed at high speed into the Atlantic. And this afternoon's satellite pass over Policjarny found head blooms in the engineering plants of the Kirov, the Minsk and more than twenty cruisers and destroyers,, indicating that the bulk of their surface fleet is also preparing to sail. Flushed, Ryan sits beside Greer. Pelt turns to Greer:
C: PELT
D: Conclusions?
C: GREER
D: Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest this is probably just an exercise having nothing to do with the Red October. A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a white-haired civilian near the top of the table:
C: MOORE
D: NSA can speak to that, Mr. Pelt.
N: PELT
C: MOORE
D: I must emphasize the extremi ' sensitivity of this information and ask that on no aooount it leave this room.
N: (PELT NODS) Before sailing, Captain Ramius sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin, Chairman of Soviet Naval Deployment. Painting at Ramius' wedding picture, Ryan whispers to Greer:
C: RYAN
D: That's her uncle!
C: GREER
D: Whose uncle?
N: RYAN (WHISPEG) Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle! Greer has no idea what Ryan's saying. Moore's still talking:
C: MOORE
D: The contents of the letter are unknown, but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded a meeting with Premier Ligachev and within minutes of that meeting, the Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find Red October --
N: (PAUSE) And sink her. Audible intake of breath round the room. Pelt is the first to RECOVER:
C: PELT
D: Sink her?
C: ADMIRAL
D: My god. They've got a madman on their hands. He's gonna start a war. A spirited discussion ensues. Tuning it out, Ryan stares at the picture of Ramius and his wife. Urgently, he whispers to Greer:
C: RYAN
D: This is the twenty-gird, isn't it? Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain: SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him.
N: PELT (DRYLY) You've something to add to the discussion, Dr. Ryan? _
C: RYAN
D: Uhhmm...I was just thinking there was perhaps another possibility we ought to consider. Ryan takes a deep breath.
C: RYAN
D: Ramius might be trying to defect. Nobody moves. Ryan glances at Greer. Greer rolls his eyes. Too far out. Ryan's on his own. The.General bristles:
E: CONT'D
C: GENERAL
D: Do you mean to suggest -
C: PELT
D: Go ahead, Dr. Ryan.
C: RYAN
D: Well, Ramius trained most of their Officer Corps. He'd be in a position to sect men willing to help him. And he's not Russian.
N: (WARMING UP) He's Lithuanian by birth, and by heritage. He was raised by his maternal grandfather, who was a fisherman. He has no children, no ties to leave behind and - (BEAT) This morning was the first anniversary of his wife's death.
C: GENERAL
D: Oh, come on! Look, what are you doing here, anyway, Ryan
N: (TO GREER) That's his name, isn't, Ryan?
C: '
D: You're just an analyst, right? You can't possi,hly know --
E: TURNING
C: RYAN
D: I know Ramins, General. He's. been a maverick for his entire career. I even met him once at an embassy dinner. ï¿½met captain Ramius, sir? Have you ever The General darkens. Making a decision, Pelt turns to the Admiral:
C: PELT
D: Bottom line, how long before Rami>us will be in a position to launch his misses at us?
C: ADMIRAL
D: Four days.
N: -40-
C: PELT
D: Alright. I'll brief the President. That will, be all, gentlemen.
N: (BEAT) Dr. Ryan. Would you stay for a moment, please? Everyone gets up to leave. As Greer rises, he winks at Ryan:
C: GREER
D: I said speak your mind, Jack, but
N: JESUS -- shaking his head, Greer pats Ryan's shoulder and leaves. Ryan's mouth is dry. Pelt gets up:
C: PELT
D: You slammed the door on the General pretty hard, Jack.
C: RYAN
D: It wasn't my intention, sir -
N: PELT (GRINNING) Yes it was. He was patronizing you and you stomped on him. In my opinion, he deserved It. (BEAT) Look, I'm a politk:ian, Jack. That means I'm a liar, a cheat and when I'm nvt kissing babies I'm stealing their lallipops. But it also means I know people and keep my options open. (BEAT) Let's assume for a minute that you're right and he intends to defect What do you think we should do?
C: RYAN
D: Well, somebody has to go out and try- - to contact him.
C: PELT
D: OK. When can you leave?
N: RYAN (FLUSHED) Wait a minute. The General was right. I'm just an analyst --
C: PELT
D: Perfect. I can't ask any of these chaï¿½tacters to go. None of them would volunteer putting their reputations on the line. And anyway, none of them are expendable.
N: (RYAN FROWNS) IR]. give you three days to prove your theory, after that we won't have any choice but to hunt Ramius down and blow him away. Will, you do it? Ryan stares at Pelt.
T: CUT TO:
C: CHOPPY SEA
D: below haze-grey sky. A ape breaks the surface, trailing a small wake. Submarine is below.
C: IN THE KONOVALOV
D: Tupolav spins the .periscope in the Konova]ov's Conn. Bonavia brings him a message. Frowning, Tupolev reads it.
C: TUPOLEV
D: Mother of God.
N: (TURNING) Down scope. Dive the ship. Saes in the Conn, prepare to dive. Tupalev is furious. Turning to Bonavia, he sneers:
C: TUPOLEV
D: The entire Soviet Fleet has been ordered to hunt Ramius down and destroy him. And where were we? Out of contact. Dead in the water!
C: BONAVIA
D: But, Captain. Have you forgotten that it was you who -

C: T BILLSI
D: Before we begin, Captain. I would like to know exactly what happened to Putin?
N: (BEAT) He didn't slip on his tea. Did he?
C: RAMIUS
D: No, Vlktor. Visibly shaken, Stadnyuk waves his hands:
C: STADNYUK
D: Captain?
C: RAMIUS
D: There is no way we could have accomplished our task with Putin aboard. He would have stopped us.
C: T BILISI
D: I have no objections to eliminating him. He was a pig. But it's a decision we should all have made.
C: BORODIN
D: You're not in command.
C: T BILISI
D: Don't give me that command garbage, Vasily. This is no ordinary cruise. We're all risking our lives. Everything that happens affects-each of us.
C: RAMIUS
D: Enough! Putin is dead. The responsibility and the guilt are mine.
N: (PAUSE) There's something else you should know. On the morning we sailed, I posted a letter to Admiral Padorin announcing our intentions to defect. Borodin's jaw drops. Tbilisi. is speechless. Kamarov whispers:
C: KAMAROV
D: In the name of God, why?
C: RAMIUS
D: We needed to burn the bridges. Make a clean break.
N: I STADNYUK (SHRIEKING) They'll find us! They'll hunt us down! 80RODIN (HISSING) Keep your voice down, Ivan. Nobody can find us. TBILISI (TO RAMIUS) You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't` just fallow the plan and turn the; submarine over to the Americans. (VOICE RISING) You had to rub Moscow's nose in it and make some kind of hare-brained political statement. (ANGRY) Goddammit, Marko. You signed our death warrants! RAMIUS (EYES BLAZING) How many times have you served in my command, Viktrxr? T BILISI (STAMMERING) Many times --

E: CONT'D
C: BORODIN
D: You heard the Captain. Dismissed! One by one, the men file out of the wardroom. When they are gone, Borodin turns to Ramius,... speaking quietly:'
C: BORODIN
D: Captain. I would never disagree with you in front of the men. But Viktor is right. We are in this together. What we are attempting is d'f cult. And --
E: CONT'D
C: RAMIUS

N: JONES (TO MANCUSO) I know you're busy, Captain. But I may have something here.
C: MANCUSO
D: Go ahead.
C: JONES
D: I've been working on a sound I heard when the typhoon disappeared. I washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it. But when I asked the computer to identify it, the answer I got. was magma displacement.
C: MANCUSO
D: Magma displacement?
C: JONES
D: Yes sir. See, the system we are using was originally- designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it. to hunt for submarines -
C: MANCUSO
D: utto the chase, Jonesy._:.,
C: JONES
D: Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious, and. started tracking. the sound on our lateral array. I located it four different times. The fifth time it was gone and I couldn't find it. But I want to show you what I worked up. Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status board overlaying the nautical map:
N: -48-
C: JONES
D: The first contact was at zero-nine-Been hours and the bearing was two-six-nine.
E: CONT'D
N: (DRAWING LINE) Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine- forty-eight is was two-ive-zero. (ANOTHER LINE) I came back to it at about ten-hundred and the bearing was two-four-two. The last signal was real faint and I didn't have a very good lock on it.
C: MANCUSO
D: So?
C: JONES
D: Well, I figure it couldn't be very far away from us, right? Let's say it was halfway between us and Iceland. That would put it on a course like this. Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso recognizes a pattern:
C: MANCUSO
D: Headed directly into Red Route One.
C: JONES
D: Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and he's taking the inshore track off the Iceland coast.
C: THOMPSON
D: What do you think, captain? Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones:
C: MANCUSO
D: Let me see if I got this straight. The three minion dollar computer tells you you're chasing after an earthquake and you aren't convinced. So you get curious and came up with this theory: on your own?
N: JONES (UNCERTAIN) Yes, sir.
C: MANCUSO
D: Relax, Jonesy. You sold me. Jones grans.
N: -49-
C: MANCUSO

D: The Dallas picked up Red October and is tracking her again. The Admiral issued orders for her to fall back and pick you up. Davenport takes Ryan's arm.
C: DAVENPORT
D: Ryan, listen to me. Getting someone on a sub is a nightmare. The Admiral told me what happened to you in the Mediterranean. The next hour could be very rough. Ryan ftroes a grin. A sax7or helps him into the helicopter. Davenport steps back. ROTORS ACCELERATE.

C: PELT
D: How can I help you, Ambassador?
C: LYSENKO
D: I'm afraid there's been a pew development.
N: (PAUSE) Apparently, the initial reports that one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate.
C: (PELT IS

N: (SWEATING) He -posted a letter just before he announcing his intentions to fire his mis' it at the United Stat s. Pelt stares at Lysenko. Lysenko shifts his weight. _ The Russian finds Pelt's steadyâ¢.gaze unnerving:
C: PELT
D: Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met?
C: LYSENKO
D: In my position, I'm sometimes compromised by the fact that Moscow doesn't tea me everything.
C: PELT
D: So one of your submarine captains has gone insane?
N: (LYSENKO NODS) What is it you want from us?
C: LYSENKO
D: The other day you offered your assistance
C: PELT
D: The other day it was a rescue mission. You want us to help you hunt Ramius down and kill. him?
C: LYSENKO
D: Because American lives are at stake, I've been instructed to ask your President for precisely that.
N: (SWALLOWING) Since you were so adamant about the consequences of confusion, I thought we might ask him together.
C: PELT
D: I understand. Pelt picks up the phone.
T: CUT TO:
C: BROKEN SUNSHINE
D: dappling a choppy sea. Ice-cold WIND whips whitecapped waves and lashes the horizon. The helicopter with Ryan aboard circles into view.
C: IN THE CHOPPER
D: HOWLING. NOISE. PILOT and COPILOT navigate tricky winds.. TWO SAILORS crouch by an open door, checking a harness on Ryan. Tuiindng to the pi ot, the copilot BELLOWS:

D: Hang on. I have contact!
C: PILOT
D: OK. Tell them to surface.
N: (RE: RYAN) Hook him up! But hurry, we don't have much fuel left! Sai],or threads cable through a winch by the door. Ryan's white as a ghost. NOISE Is DEAFENING. Another saï¿½ar belts a harness to Ryan's back. Ryan peers down. Wind from the rotors crushes the waves. Between his feet, Ryan can see the small white wake from a periscope.
C: ON THE DALLAS
D: in the Conn, Mancuso spins the scope. Thompson watches him. Both he and Mancuso wear life jackets:
C: MANCUSO
D: Whoever this guy is, he's in far one hell of a ride.
N: ( NG) Officer of the deck. Surface the ship. A flurry of activity in the Conn. The Dallas prepares to surface. Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm.
C: IN THE CHOPPER
D: the saftors i nish strapping Ryan into the sling. One of them leans forward, painting to a ]ever on Ryan's chest, SHOUTING:

D: You got a man dangling at the end of a line with no paint of reference and helicopter rotors generating enough static electak ty that we have to ground him or it! l be like grabbing a hot wire and if he falls in the water the only way to get him out is with divers 'cause most of the ship's underwater.
N: (PAUSE) Fun? THOMPSON (G NING) Why I joined the Navy. A sager hands Mancuso a phone for the bridge.
C: THOMPSON

D: Ryan watches Mancuso and Thompson climb out of the sail onto the lurching bridge.The sailer leans close, HOLLERING:
C: SAILOR
D: Hang on! He trips a laver on the winch. Cable feeds out a few feet Holding his breath, Ryan inches into the abyss.
C: ON THE BRIDGE
D: Mancuso lays binoculars on Ryan. Thompson ties both of them to the sail The sub pitches and rolls. Forward and aft are buried beneath waves. Fingers freezing, Thompson clamps one end of a jumper cable to a metal lip on the bridge to ground the sub against static generated by the helicopter's rut
C: IN THE AIR
D: savage WINDS from the chopper's ROTORS start spinning Ryan like a top. Desperately, he trams to control the dizzying motion. Above, caught in an unexpected wind sheer, the chopper plummets seaward. Ryan's line goes slack. Angry sea rushes up at him with blistering speed.
C: IN THE CHOPPER
D: the pilot struggles for control. Behind him, loose equipment SLAMS into the WINCH, JAMMING the CABLE. CURSING, the pilot regains control. The chopper stabilizes.
C: IN THE AIR
D: CRACKING like a WHIP, the CABLE goes TAUT. Ryan feels like he's been hit with a sledgehammer. Unable to breathe, he RIPS off his HELMET. A rock in a sling, he tries to get his bearings. Everything's grey. Above, the chopper's rotors CHEW the SKY. Help] s, Ryan starts swinging like a pendulum.
C: ON THE BRIDGE
D: Mancuso and Thompson watch Ryan rocket by at Mach 10. A huge arc carries him way out over the angry sea. Slowing down, Ryan starts to spin again.
N: MANCUSO (SCREAMING) See if you can get a ground on his line. I'm gonna try and catch the bastard! Way out on the horizon, Ryan reaches the end of his arc and starts a comet-like ride back at the ship.

C: PILOT
D: Reel him back in!
N: SAILOR (TRYING) The cable's jammed!

C: IN THE AIR
D: Ryan watches the Dallas' saw rush at him with unbelievable speed, a towering black monolith on an ubiquitous canvas of grey.
C: ON THE BRIDGE
D: Thompson readies the ground, holding one end in the air. A wave BLASTS the DALLAS.
C: THE GROUNDING CABLE
D: rips free of the bridge. Surprised, Thompson goes overboard. Caught in his harness, he dangles helplessly above the water. Mancuso and Ryan reach for each other as Ryan hurtles at the bridge. All hell breaks loose:
C: A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY
D: arcs between their oohed hands. BLITZED, Mancuso is KNOCKED hard to his KNEES.
C: IN THE CHOPPER,

C: IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK
D: Jones hears Mancuso's voice BOOMING over SPEAKERS:
N: MANCUSO (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Man overboard! Twenty yards off the starboard bow! The COB SLAMS the HATCH, turning the trunk into an iron tomb. Jones pulls a mask over his eyes, activates his oxygen and drags open the exterior hatch.

C: IN THE AIR
D: the chopper banks hard to the left, climbs Into the mist and starts circling the Dams.
C: IN THE WATER
D: free of the harness, Ryan bobs like a cork in the waves. Fifty yards away, the keeness sub p bahes violently.
N: A ' DIVER surfaces next to Ryan. Removing his mouthpiece, Jones BELLOWS over the CRASHING SEA:
C: JONES
D: Are. you injured!?
C: JONES
D: I'm gonna take you in through an escape trunk! Jones hooks Ryan to the line. Salt stings Ryan's eyes. His, breathing's ragged.
C: ON THE DALLAS
D: BEDLAM in the CONN. STACCATO orders. Mancuso helps Thompson through the hatch. Hell on wheels, Mancuso disappears down a passageway.

D: into bruised silence. Pulling themselves downward along the Dalla rolling hull, Ryan and Jones share oxygen.
C: IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK
D: Ryan and Jones pull themselves inside. Blazing light ignites a fire storm of one-caned organisms. Eyes wide, Ryan watches Jones c3 se the hatch. Jones starts draining the trunk. Everything slows down. Echoes REVERBERATE. The water level in the trunk drops and the

C: OOD
D: Captain. Battle stations are manned.
C: MANCUSO
D: Very well.
C: RYAN
D: What do you mean battle stations?
N: (URGENTLY) Look, I've been authorized by the President of the United States to talk to the Captain of Red October. Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket:
C: MANCUSO
D: And I have been ordered to blow him out of the water if he stays on a course to the United States or demonstrates any hostile intentions.
N: RYAN (STUNNED) I don't understand. MANCUSO (RE: MESSAGE) According to this he's gone bughouse and intends to fire his missiles. So much f= your defection theory. Mancuso hands Ryan the message.. Ryan stares at. it. Mancuso turns back to the officer of the deck:
C: MANCUSO
D: Officer of the deck. Make,
E: CONT'D

C: MANCUSO
D: All. stop i Come left and stay in his baffles. Rig for quiet running.
N: The officer of the deck repeats Mancuso's orders. Mancuso and Ryan are eyeball-etc-eyeball.. Ryan whispers:
C: RYAN
D: Listen to me, Captain. There must be some way you can establish contact without violating your orders. I'm telling you, he wants to defect.
N: (MANCUSO FROWNS) If there's ever going to be peace in the world somebody has to take a risk. Give the man a chance. He's defecting. I know it. (MANCUSO HESITATES) Please.

C: MANCUSO
D: It means, he's a very cool customer,
C: YOUR RUS
D: sian. He knows we're here and that we are ready to fire. But he's not going to provoke us. He's heading to periscope depth to see what's on the surface.

C: BORODIN
D: Good. Then I will raise rabbits in Montana and marry a round American

C: PET RO V
D: Captain, there are high Esâºsion product levels in the primary coolant!
N: (BABBLING) I knew we should have checked the reactor before we started it. When the caterpillar broke down the vare must have been damaged!
C: RANIUS
D: Keep your vcadoe down, Doctor. There are several explanations -

Climbing out on the deck, Tblllsi and a half a dozen sailors try to inflate rafts. Red October PITCHES and ROLLS. Wind HOWLS. Frurated, Tbilisi SCREAMS into a headset.
C: IN THE CONN
D: through the open emergency door, the sea CRASHES. Frightened to death, shivering sailors in life preservers line up to leave. Petrov counts them. Ramius stands by Sorodin.
C: BORODIN
D: Captain. L,ieubenant Tbi3JsJ reports the sea state is too rough to launch the rafts' over the she. The men will be gushed!

RAMIUS (TO PETROV) There's only one thing we can do. Go topside and take care of the crew. I and my officers wall submerge the ship and take her elsewhere to scuttle. The Americans must never have this boat! All Petrov wants do to is get his ass off the boat. At the door, Ramius stops him:
C: RAMIUS
D: Doctor. When you get home. You will. hear many stories about me and some are true. But tell them that in the end I did my duty. Petrov splits. Borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it.

D: the ocean RAGES. Red October sets to submerge. GEYSERS of WATER and air EXPLODE hundreds of feet in the sky as she dives. The BLOWBACK is STAGGERING. Wild-eyed sailors in rubber rafts hang on for their lives. On the horizon, Petrov spots the American frigate hurtling forward, light flashing. A puff of smoke appears, fbnowed by a muted EXPLOSION. The frigate's FIRING. As the round comes in, there is an
C: EARSPLITTING SHRIEK.
D: A hundred yards beyond Red October's bow, the SEA EXPLODES. The CONCUSSION and the STORM are mind-bending. Petrov thinks the world's coming to an end. In the rafts, men slash at ropes binding them to the deck. One by one, they drift free of the submerging ship into foaming sea. One sailor can't cut his rope. His raft's dragged under. Wind HOWLS. The frigate FIRES AGAIN. Another EARSPLITTING SHRIEK. Another EXPLOSION. Tons of icy saltwater cascade over Petxov's head. - Gulping air, Petrov spots the raft and sail r pop back to the surface. Red October's sail disappears. Sailors haul freezing men from raging water. Hell on earth.

D: on the fwltml of the frigate, PILOT and copilot are strapped into the crowded cockpit. Copilot flips a bank of toggle switches above his head.
N: PILOT (INTO MIKE) Roger, Bravo Command. Seahawk one request vector to target Red October. (LISTENING) Copy that. We're on our way.
C: IN. THE AIR
D: the helicopter rises from the fantail of the frigate. In seconds, it passes over Petrov and his companions floating in rubber rafts in choppy sea.
C: IN Â°THE HELICOPTER
D: the pilot glances over his shoulder at a SENSOR OPERATOR working a computer behind the copilot:
C: PILOT
D: Torpedo Inputs?
C: SENSOR OPERATOR
D: Set and veri ed as ordered.
C: IN THE WATER
D: the life rafts converge on the frigate like insects hovering round an oversized queen. In one of the rafts, Petrov watches as a net is thrown down at him.
C: IN THE HELICOPTER
D: the p eyeballs the sea as it races by. Speaking into a mike:
C: PILOT
D: Roger that, Bravo One. Five hundred yards to the drop paint. Torpedo is armed and ready.
C: IN THE CIC
D: aboard the fcigate, Curry turns to one of the shadows:
C: CURRY
D: Seahawk One reports torpedo armed and ready to fire. Requests final authorization to drop.
C: IN THE RAFTS
D: Petrov and the others climb the nets. Halfway up, the doctor stares back at the helicopter hovering in the distance.
C: IN THE AIR
D: thirty feet above the water, the helicopter releases a torpedo in the area where Red October went down.
C: ON THE FRIGATE
D: Petrov climbs onto the fantail. U.S. sailors are waiting with coffee and blankets. Fuming, Petrov confronts an officer:
C: PETROV
D: I protest! What authority do you have to fire? I protest!
C: IN THE CIC
D: Curry coordinates information. AIL around him, men work intensely. Curry turns to one of the shadows:
C: CURRY
D: Seahawk One reports torpedo is launched and running normally at forty knots. I have it on sonar.
N: (TURNING) Four hundred yards from drop paint. Eight hundred yards. Twelve hundred yards. One of the shadows leans forward and presses a button on Curry's console. The button is marked Command Control Detonate. The SHADOW IS
C: ADMIRAL GREER
D: in a white uniform and cap. Beside him, Skip Tyler, leans on his cane, concentrating on Curry's display.
C: IN THE HELICOPTER
D: Pilot studies the sea. Suddenly, it BULGES. Loud CONCUSSION. Shock WAVE. A giant mushroom cap rises from the depths as gas bubbles vent.
C: ON THE FANTAIL
D: Petrov watches in horror as a huge concave impression vents below the helicopter. A huge plume of gas and water erupts skyward.
C: IN THE CIC
D: aboard the frigate, Curry turns to Greer:
C: CURRY
D: Torpedo has detonated.
C: GREER
D: And you understand, Lieutenant. I was never here. That torpedo did not self-destruct. It hit the target. Right?
N: (CURRY NODS) Now, Contact the Dallas and tell them to proceed. Curry nods.
T: CUT TO:
C: MANCUSO
D: in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message:
C: THOMPSON
D: Frigate reports phase one completed, Captain. We are ordered to proceed.
C: MANCUSO
D: OK. Now comes the weird part. Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into
C: A PASSAGEWAY
D: running aft. Mancuso and Thompson move at speed. Mancuso is far
N: FROM HAPPY:
C: MANCUSO
D: I don't like leaving the boat, Phil. But the orders are specific.
C: THOMPSON
D: We're gonna be f ne. Rounding a corner, they start
C: DOWN A LADDER
D: Thompson will never get over how fast Mancuso can move. Aren't guys that big supposed to be slow?
C: MANCUSO
D: This has got to be the craziest stunt I've ever heard of. There's only about two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong. At the bottom of the ladder, they enter
C: A PASSAGEWAY
D: Ahead of them Jones and Ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open hatch. Like Mancuso, Jones is armed. Jones starts up the ladder. Ryan follows. Mancuso turns to Thompson:
C: MANCUSO
D: Listen. If anything --
C: THOMPSON
D: Captain. We'll be all right. Mancuso climbs up the ladder, disappearing through the hatch. Thompson closes it.
T: CUT TO:
C: WARRANT OFFICER STEINER
D: sitting before a wheel at a brightly lit panel, just as cocky as when we last saw him in the mini sub at Tyler's lab. Next to him, a COPILOT checks a clipboard. Behind them, Jones, Ryan and Mancuso climb up through a hatch. Jones shuts it. Steiner speaks into a headset::
C: STEINER
D: OX. Passengers are aboard. Check-off complete. Request clearance to lift-off.
N: (TURNING) Gentlemen, we have clearance. Fasten your belts and grab your nuts. We're taking a ride. Ryan sits opposite Mancuso. Jones is to Mancuso's right. The bulkhead rocks slightly. Steiner turns a yoke.
C: STEINER
D: Battery sperm?
E: CONT'D
N: -95-
C: COPILOT
D: Eighty percent capacity. Homing beacon is five degrees to the right. Recommend new course zero-seven-five. Range now five hundred yards.
C: STEINER
D: Roger. Coming right to course zero-seven- ive. Make initial preparations to land. The copilot starts toggling switches. Behind him, Mancuso checks the .45 in his holster. Ryan watches.
C: COPILOT
D: Contact is two hundred yards below. One hundred yards ahead.
C: STEINER
D: Roger.
N: (BEAT) Hit the running lights.
C: IN THE WATER
D: -black on black. Then, in a single blinding flash of light
C: THE RED OCTOBER
D: is revealed. Hovering above it, floodlights blazing, the DSRV. Descending, it locks onto a hatch by the sail.
C: IN THE DSRV
D: Copilot turns to Steiner:
C: COPILOT
D: We have a seal. Skirt is dry.
C: STEINER
D: Roger. Open the hatch. Getting up, the copilot heads for the hatch.
C: MANCUSO
D: Wait. Copilot stops. Reaching into his jacket, Mancuso offers Ryan a .45.
N: RYAN (EYEING PI- ) He's defecting.
C: MANCUSO
D: And he can't change his mind?
C: RYAN
D: He's not going to change his mind.
C: MANCUSO
D: Willing to bet your life on that.' Ryan stares at the pistol. Sighing, he puts it in his jacket. Copilot opens the hatch. In the gloom below, another hatch. Copilot raps on it. Somebody opens the lower hatch. Mancuso, Jones and Ryan climb down into
C: THE RED OCTOBER
D: on a ladder at the forward end of the Conn. Waiting for them, Ramins, Borodin and all the other of Awkward silence. Nervous, Borodin drags out a cigarette and lights it. Unexpectedly,
N: RYAN- SMI1 :
C: RYAN
D: Russian Cigarette?
N: (BORODIN NODS) Could I try one? Mancuso frowns. Borodin offers Ryan a cigarette. Kamarov has a light. Ryan inhales and COUGHS: RYAN (CONT'D) (GAGGING) Jesus... Poking fun, Ryan rolls his eyes. Borodin grins. Ramius The ice is broken. Men shake hands.
C: RAMIUS
D: Gentlemen, I am Marko Ramius. I and my offers request political asylum in the United States.
N: (BEAT) Before I go any further, I want to know whose idea is this impos.ih18 plan? MANCUSO (RE: RYAN) His. RAMIUS (TO RYAN) Amazing. our intention was to publicly surrender this boat and request asylum. it never occurred to us there would be a way you could keep it. The idea to stage a radiation leak was inspired -- (FROWNING) You look familiar. Do I know you, Commander?
C: RYAN
D: You have a good memory, Captain. We meet briefly years ago. But I'm not a naval commander. I work for the CIA.
N: RAMIUS CIA?
C: RYAN
D: Easy, Captain. I'm not an agent. I'm just an analyst.
N: (SMRNNG) I write books. Suddenly, HIGH SPEED SCREWS passing over the HULL:
C: KAMAROV
D: Torpedo! Americans are shooting at us.
C: JONES
D: Wrong. Ours growl. Yours whine. It's Russian!
T: CUT TO:
C: GREER
D: leaning over Curry's console in the CIC aboard the frigate. Agitated, Curry works his computer.
C: GREER
D: What do you mean there's another torpedo? Where in hell did it come from?
T: CUT TO:
C: TUPOLEV
D: in the Conn aboard the Konovalov. His crew's at battle stations. Bonavia mans fire cost 'aL opening a mike, Tupolev SHOUTS:
C: TUPOLEV
D: Sonar. Why hasn't our torpedo impacted?
N: SONAR (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) The weapon enabled on the other side of the target. It passed Red October before it armed. TUPOLEV (TO BONAVIA) You had the wrong range, idiot! Fire again with the right settings. And reload both tubes.
C: ON THE DALLAS
D: Thompson stands outside the sonar shack. To his left, the COB is behind fire control. Beaumont has taken Jones' position.
C: BEAUMONT
D: New oorrtact. Sierra four-one, bearing zero-one-zero. Aku]a c1a.ï¿½.s Soviet submarine.
N: (BEAT) Launch noises. He's shooting again.
C: THOMPSON
D: What's the status of Red October?
C: BEAUMONT
D: Dead in the water.
C: THOMPSON
D: They can't maneuver with the goddam DSRV stuck to them.
N: (WHISPERING) Come on, Mancuso, move it. Get the hell out of there.
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: BEDLAM in the Conn. Tba'lisi and Jones are on their way to sonar. Ramius SHOUTS at Melekhin:
C: RAMIUS
D: Get back to engineering and give me some power!
N: (TO MANCUSO
C: RE: DSRV)
D: Get that damn thing off my boat. Mancuso's halfway up the ladder. He spots Steiner peeking down at
N: HIM:
C: STEINER
D: I think somebody just shot a torpedo at us!
C: MANCUSO
D: No shit, buckwheat. Get the hell. out of here!
N: STEINER (STUNNED) Where am I supposed -- Mancuso SLAMS the HATCH. Scrambling down the ladder, Mancuso hears Ramius bel]Dwing at Borodin who is manning the helm: -99-
C: RAMIUS
D: No, Vasily. I need you in fire control. We must track whoever's out there. Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair behind the helm :
C: RAMIUS
D: You sit here!
E: CONT'D
N: RYAN BUTICAN'T --
C: RAMIUS
D: Do exactly as I tell you! Stunned, Ryan grabs the helm. Jones and Tbilisi, must have made it to sonar. Speakers CRACKLE:
N: JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) DSRV is away. There's a Russian Akula about eight thousand yards starboard. TBILISI (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) It's the Konovalov. RAMIUS (TO RYAN) All ahead flank! RYAN
C: DNG)
D: I told you I'm just an analyst. I write books.
E: PANIC
N: RAMIUS - (LEANING FORWARD) Turn that knob all the way to the right. Ryan: does. AIL around him the world is going stark raving mad. Again, SPEAKERS CRACKLE: JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo in the water. High speed screws. Beaming zero-two-zero. I estimate range at about eight thousand yards. RAMIUS (TO RYAN) Turn the helm to the heft. Steer course zero-two-zero. MANCUSO (TO RAMIUS) Wait a minute! That's heading into the t o rpedo. You should turn away from it. JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Steady bearing to the weapon. Still zero-two-zero. Range about seven thousand yards. RAMIUS (TO RYAN) Turn that helm to the left until the dial says course zero-two-zero.
C: MANCUSO
D: No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn that goddam wheel! Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero.
N: RYAN (TOO MANCUSO) Sorry, Captain. I think -- MANCUSO (TO RAMIIUS) You're heading straight into that torpedo.
C: RAMIUS
D: I know.
C: IN THE CIC
D: aboard the frigate. Helms, Greer and Tyler lean over the display. Curry studies the blips:
N: CURRY (EYES NARROWING) Red October is turning directly into the t orpedos path.
C: GREER
D: Mother of God.
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: in the Conn, it's a deathwatch. Ryan thinks of Sally. Mancuso stares at Ramius. Goddamned if he's gonna be the one to whine.
N: JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo steady bearing zero-two-zero. Range five thousand yards. RAMIUS (ON MIKE) Me]ekhin. Can you give me any more speed? MELEKHIN (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Negative. We're going as fast as we can. JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Estimate range approximately three thousand yards. Closing fast.
C: ON THE DALLAS
D: Thompson's still outside the sonar shack. The COB's at Fare control. As before, Beaumont works sonar.
C: THOMPSON
D: Why is he heading into the torpedo? Is he trying to kill himself?
C: COB
D: Mr. Thompson. We have a solution on the Soviet Akula. Shouldn't we shoot back?
N: THOMPSON (ANGRY) She didn't shoot at us. Anyway, I can't attack a Soviet submarine. I have no goddam authorization!
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: in the Conn, an. payers have turned to stone.
N: JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo bearing steady at zero-two- zero. Best range nine hundred yards. Estimate impact in twenty seconds. RAMIUS (TO RYAN) What books?
C: RYAN
D: Pardon?
N: JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Fifteen seconds.
C: RAMIUS
D: What books did you write?
N: RYAN (HOARSELY) I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey, called, Fighting Sailor. It was about tam in combat -- JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Ten seconds.
C: RAMIUS
D: I know this book. I have read some parts of it.
N: (RYAN BLINKS) Your conclusions were wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly. CRASH. The Conn ROCKS. Sound of TORPEDO BREAKING UP. Metal SCRAPES along the SHIP. Realizing what's going on: - MANCUSO I'll be dammed.
C: RYAN
D: What happened?
C: MANCUSO
D: Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the distance before it could arm itself. I never would have thought of it.
C: RYAN
D: So we're safe?
C: RAMIUS
D: Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain, a man named Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons. He won't make the same mistake twice. Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand.
N: SUDDENLY:
C: A FIRE STORM
D: of GUNFIRE sprays the CONN. Everybody scatters. Borodin is HIT. SLAMMING into the bulkhead, he falls in a seated position, eyes wide. Fire control panel EXPLODES. Behind a console, Mancuso drags out his .45 and RETURNS FIRE. The shadow disappears.
C: ON THE DALLAS
D: Beaumont rips off his headgear, turning to Thompson in the sonar shack's door, breathing hard:
C: BEAUMONT
D: Jesus Christ. Gunge.
C: THOMPSON
D: Gunfire?
C: ON THE KONOVALOV
D: in the Conn, Tupa]av is furious. He YELLS at Bonavia:
C: TUPOLEV
D: Hurry up goddammit! I want all the enabling devices disconnected!
C: BONAVIA
D: Captain, I cannot go any faster.
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: in the Conn, cars crawl from hiding. Sparks ERUPT from WIRES. Fire contra is history. Ramius leans over Borodin:
C: BORODIN
D: I would have like to have seen Montana. And the Indians. captain? - _. He dies. RAGING, Ramius POUNDS the BULKHEAD. Kamarov notices a light on a panel:
E: eyes gT'âºg
C: KAMAROV
D: He's in the missile compartment!
N: RAMIUS (TO MANCUSO) The ship is yours.
C: MANCUSO
D: But the control is blasted to hell. I can't shoot.
C: RAMIUS
D: Then get behind him and stay there. Don't let him put you in his sights or we're all dead. Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan follows.
T: CUT TO:
C: TUPOLEV
D: a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking back at him :
C: BONAVIA
D: Enabling devices are removed.
N: TUPOLEV ABOUT TIMEL (INTO MIKE) Sonar, give me a bearing on Red October. SONAR (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) She's taken position behind us.
C: TUPOLEV
D: Damn.
N: (TO HELM) Left full rudder. T11 shake him loose.
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: in a passageway outside a door to the missile compartment, Ramius and Ryan hug the bulkhead:
C: RAMIUS
D: He'll break into a panel and short -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll be blown to pieces. Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the
C: MISSILE COMPARTMENT
D: coming face-too-face with a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Ramius is HIT. Ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel. Mercifully, the shooting STOPS. Ryan checks Ramius. His shoulder's a mess. Mind riling, Ryan studies his surroundings. He's never felt so alone. The compartment is vast, dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet
N: in diameter. Overhead, a catwalk. At the aft end, somebody's working with a wrench.
C: RAMIUS
D: We must stop him before he gets into a panel.. Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody. Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket,
N: MUMBLING: RYAN (TO HIMSELF) Next time memos. Only memos.
C: RAMIUS
D: Be careful what you shoot at in here, Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive. In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING:
C: RYAN
D: Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan. Very sensitive.. .in here...
C: IN THE CONN
D: on Red October, a handful of men struggle to fight the ship. Kamarov mans the wheel. Sonar SPEAKERS POP:
N: JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) He's going deep! MANCUSO (TO KAMAROV) Twenty degrees down on the bowl
C: IN THE MISSILE COMPARTMENT
D: The wall becomes the floor. Fighting to keep his balance, Ryan walks on the wall, still MUMBLING:
C: RYAN
D: Sensitive stuff...in here ...I have to... be careful... of course. The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan hangs at a ninety degree angle. GUNFIRE. Bullets RIP into the BULKHEAD inches from his HEAD:
C: RYAN
D: I have to be careful what I shoot at.. He doesn't have to be careful... He can shoot at anything he wants.
E: CONT'D
C: IN THE CIC
D: aboard the frigate, curry hunches over a console. Greer and Tyler
N: WATCH ANXIOUSLY:
C: CURRY
D: The Akula is too fast. No way Red October can stay behind her. lt's only a matter of time now.
N: (BEAT) The Akula's turning. She's fired another torpedo. This one can't miss.
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: in sonar, Jones and Tbzisi hear PINGING become LOUDER, more FREQUENT. Holding the mike, ashen:
C: JONES
D: Another torpedo, Captain. It has enabled and is active. It has acquired us and is homing.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE DEEP
D: Red October looms into view. To the right, the Konovalov shimmers in the dark. Between them, the torpedo appears. PINGS grow CLOSER and CLOSER. At the last minute
C: THE DALLAS
D: raves into view, rocketing forward at full, bore, streaking between Red October and the torpedo. it's really something.
C: IN THE CIC
D: aboard the frigate, Curry SHOUTS:
C: CURRY
D: Jesus Chi i t.
N: GREER
C: CURRY
D: The Dallas has moved between Red October and the torpedo. The torpedo is chasing the Dallas now!
C: ON THE DALLAS
D: in the sonar shack. Beaumont works his equipment, speaking into a
N: MIKE:
C: BEAUMONT
D: Conn, sonar. Torpedo is in acquisition. Range five hundred yards and c3nsing. You've done it, Mr. Thompson!
C: IN THE CONN
D: on the Dallas, Thompson stands on the deck. The COB is at ballasCt control, holding the emergency blow handles.
C: THOMPSON
D: Chief, release counter-measures and emergency blow all main valves. Let's hope to Christ this works!
N: COB
C: (ON PHONE}
D: Signal ejector station. Release counter-measures.
N: (PULLING HANDLES) Emergency blow ! SHRIEK of the BLOW is DEAFENING. The deck angles crazily upwards at thirty degrees. Gear CRASHES to the FLOOR. Eardrums SHATTERING, Thompson holds on, fighting gravity.
C: IN THE WATER
D: the DAIlas heads for the surface. Counter-measures head for the bottom. The incoming torpedo chases the counter-measures, disappearing into the abyss.
C: ON THE SURFACE
D: The Da11a ERUPTS from the WATER at THIRTY DEGREES, her bottom exposed well aft of the sail. A broaching behemoth, she CRASHES back into the sea, DISPLACING TONS of WATER.
C: ON THE FRIGATE
D: neither Soviet nor American sailors on the fantail can believe their eyes. Peirov's jaw drops. Has the entire world gone completely insane?.
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: in the missile compartment, blood pounding, Ryan leans flat against a missile tube. On the other side of the tube, METAL fans on
C: CONCRETE.
D: Rounding the tube, Ryan holds the .45 at arm's length. Kneeling before him, directly in front of an open panel on the missale bay is a Sovvet sail or with crazy eyes:
C: IT'S LOGINOV
D: the cook's assistant who witnessed the Putin key exchange. He's got a hot wire in each hand. Time stands sthl. Ryan stares at Loginov. Loginov stares back. There's something in the Loginov's eyes, an uncompromising, irrational vi lainy that asks no forgiveness. For a moment, Ryan's paralyzed, a rabbit before a cobra. Deliberately, Loginov begins to move his hands together, bringing the wires closer. Ryan tri es to speak. He can't. Loginov's grin cracks wide like a rotten egg.
C: RYAN FIRES
D: Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the .45. The pistol KICKS like a MULE. Loginov is delivered to eternity. Impotent, the wires fall to the floor.
C: ON THE KONOVALOV
D: Flushed, Tupolev towers over fire oontroL Seated before him, Bonavia tries to hang on to his sanity.
C: BONAVIA
D: Directly ahead. Range five hundred yards.
C: TUPOLEV
D: Got him. Match bearings and the.
C: BONAVIA
D: We are too close. I have to set
C: TUPOLEV
D: Shoot now! Tupolev pulls the lever himself.
C: ON RED: OCTOBER':
D: in the : Conn, Mancuso, Kamarov and the others are on pins and needles. What next? Suddenly, they hear PIN GIN G.
N: JONES (VO) (ON SPEAKERS) Launch transient astern. He's shooting again. Very close.
C: MANCUSO
D: Left full rudder!
N: JONES (LOUDER PINGS) Weapon is alive. (LOUDER PINGS) It has acquired. Sound of torpedo passing close to the hull: JONES (VO CONT'D) (ON SPEAKERS) Weapon passed close aboard. Is Ong re-attack. Hold on. It's reacquired. But not on us! Ryan appears with Ramius aft of the Conn. Pinging grows QUIETER, more DISTANT.
C: ON THE KONOVALOV
D: in the Conn, Tupalev is suddenly confused, disorientaed by the
N: PINGS.
C: TUPOLEV
D: Wait. I -
N: SONAR (VO) (OVER SPEAKERS) Our torpedo missed Red October and is homing on us! TUPOLEV (STUNNED) How could that be?
C: BONAVIA
D: The weapon was not properly programmed. PINGS CLOSER. LOUDER. Finally, PINGS become a SPINE- TINGLTNG HOWL. Bonavia SHOUTS:
C: BONAVIA
D: You stupid arrogant bastard. You've Idiled us all!
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE . WATER Blinding light. The Konovalov disintegrates. Billowing pockets of gas embrace the deep. Thirty-seven hundred tons of steel. and iron rip apart in the blink of an eye.
C: ON THE SURFACE
D: a white mountain of displaced water rises into the air, compresses and explodes.
C: ON THE FRIGATE
D: in shock, the Russian crew gapes at the explosion. The young sailor who took courage from Ramius makes the sign of the cross.
C: ON RED OCTOBER
D: in the Conn, as the aftershock subsides, Ryan helps Ramius up off the floor, trying to make him comfortable against a bulkhead:
C: RAMIUS
D: Captain Tupalev has just provided your pantomime with the one thing you could never have managed.
N: RYAN (NODDING) Wreckage.
T: CUT TO:
C: PELT
D: in his office seated across from Lysenko:
C: PELT
D: With the depth of the water and the wreckage scattered over such a wide area, it we]. be a long time before anything is recovered. Your people are already interviewing the crew and making arrangements for their r turn. (Lysenko nods,
C: SOBERLY)
D: This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador. I can only stress that if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avcdded.
C: LYSENKO
D: I appreciate your candor in the matter.
N: PELT (SMOOTHLY) And I yours, Andrei.. LYSENKO (PROBING) Perhaps in the future, the technology will be available for a more thorough I n vestigation of the wreckage... PELT (STEADY) Perhaps. A long beat as the two men stare at each other. Lysenko finally breaks it off:
C: LYSENKO
D: There is another matter... One I am reluctant to -
C: PELT
D: No. Please go ahead.
C: LYSENKO
D: One of our submarines, an Akula, was last reported in the Reykjanes Ridge. We have not heard from her for sometime. Pelt stares at him blankly, time hangs suspended. Finally, Peat reaches far the bridge of his now as if to stave of a ]dtler
N: HEADACHE:
C: PELT
D: You've lost another submarine?
N: (BEAT) Andre... Lysenko sits, hat in hand. Finally, he averts his gaze.
T: JUMP CUT TO:
C: A DRIVER
D: standing beside a limousine outside the Executive Office Building. Fuming, Lysenko approaches. The driver smiles. Not a good idea.
N: LYSENKO SNARL:
C: LYSENKO
D: Shut up! Don't speak to me Boris. Don't ever speak to me unless I speak to you first. And wipe that smile off your face! Lysenko pBe into the limo, slamming the door as hard as he can. Locked inside, he starts shouting and hitting things.
T: CUT TO:
C: BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
D: on the tree studded bank of a large coastal river. A gentle breeze touches the trees and punctuates the silence. Crickets and frogs sing on the shore:
N: SUPER: ORICOKE RIVER PAMLICO SOUND NORTH CAROLINA
C: THE RED OCTOBER
D: glides quietly up the river's surface. Ramius and Ryan stand on the sail. Behind them, two junior officers, one American and one Russian, Conn the ship:
C: RYAN
D: We're two hundred miles from the nearest naval base.
C: RAMIUS
D: Interesting notion, hiding a submarine in a river.
N: (EYEING SHORE) How do you know this place?
C: RYAN
D: I grew up not far from here.
N: (PAINTING) My grandfather taught me to f5sh right over there on that rock. Ramius spots a large rock on the shore. So warm and inviting, this land, when compared to the bitter cold coast he ]eft a ]ifetl,me ago. Ram hl studies Ryan in the stillness:
C: RAMIUS
D: There is one question you have not asked me.
C: RYAN
D: Why?
N: (RAMIUS NODS) I assumed you would speak when you were ready.
C: RAMIUS
D: We. are standing on part of the reason. I've spent my life preparing to fight a war I hoped would never happen. This ship was not built to fight such a war. it was built to start one.
N: (BEAT) And there were personal reasons.
C: RYAN
D: Your wife?
N: RAMIUS (NODDING) it started there, perhaps. Ramius glances at the rock. Beside it, a muskrat drops quietly into the water.
C: RAMIUS
D: Or perhaps it was something that started long ago...
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: Fishing?
C: RAMTUS
D: Fishing. Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights from farms twinkle in the night air.
C: RAMIUS
D: "The sea will, grant each man new hope, as sleep doth dream of home." Christopher Columbus. Ryan smilm.
E: CONT'D on Ryan's look
N: RYAN (QU`EDY) Welcome to the new world, sir.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: A STEWARDESS
D: walking down the aisle of an airplane, checking passengers. Stopping near the front of the cabin, she glances down at
C: RYAN
D: sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him
C: A TEDDY BEAR
D: smi> out at passing clouds. The bear's got a red ribbon round his neck-and a seat belt fastened over his bulging tummy.
N: Covering Ryan with the blanket, the stewardess leaves. Tea cup RATTLES. Ryan doesn't even twitch. Turbulence is a thing of the past.
T: FADE OUT
N: THE END
