T: CUT TO:
S: 3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
N: With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed bump. The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab. In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by. The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like the end of the world. The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later. Like a broken ragdoll shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass for a block. He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of blood forms out his nose. The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing howl for one entire city block.
T: CUT TO:
S: 4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY
N: Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others flesh. An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?
C: OLD MAN
D: Who the hell knows. What you have in your mouth?
N: The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.
C: OLD MAN
D: Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth out ... doctor said. What you tryin to do? SPIT IT OUT!!!
N: The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes. Out comes a tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.
T: CUT TO:
N: 5. WASP NEST A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest. A SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks. One kid busies himself shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the nest. Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk. All the kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.
T: CUT TO:
S: 6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

N: Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Mariettas twenty-year old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.
C: LULA
D: Mama???
C: MARIETTA
D: You know who it was and you know you arent, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
C: LULA

T: CUT TO:
S: 8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULAS ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY
N: Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo. Speed metal music jumps up to around one hundred twenty decibels.
T: CUT TO:
S: 9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
N: The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell. The iron bars of the door slide across Sailors face and close with a bang.
T: CUT TO:
S: 10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT
N: A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the club - leaning out the car in every direction. They scream out to the desolate-looking passerby.
C: TEENAGERS
D: EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!
N: The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.
T: CUT TO:
S: 11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT
N: Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH BOYS. The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.
C: BEANY
D: I can dig this music... But not that singer.
C: LULA
D: Why?... Hes right in the groove.
C: BEANY
D: Hes so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts aint quite my type.
C: LULA
D: Seeins how youre about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, dont know how you can criticize.
E: giggles
C: BEANY
D: Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, hes a liar.
N: Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.
C: BEANY
D: So, Sailors gettin out soon, and youre gonna see him?
N: Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.
C: LULA
D: Meetin him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mamas hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
C: BEANY
D: I didnt hate me so much, Id feel better wishin you luck.
C: LULA
D: Cant all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo probly wouldnta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadnt kicked his ass out.
C: BEANY
D: So youre gonna be needin the blue-bird pretty soon?
C: LULA
D: Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
N: The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

S: 12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY
N: Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 13. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
N: An empty livingroom. The smoke from the city fire appears during the course of the DISSOLVE to be in the livingroom - then it disappears. An empty hallway. An empty stairway.
S: 13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAS BEDROOM - DAY
N: Feet (Lulas) was across carpet. A closet door opens. A hand (Lulas) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mothers closet. The hand comes out clutching car keys.

N: Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage.

T: CUT TO:
S: 16. INT. BEANY THORNS GARAGE - DAY

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
N: Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the house. We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance. The calling changes - it becomes angry. The garage door opens and Marietta comes storming out. She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.
T: CUT TO:
S: 18. INT. SOUTHERN TIME BAR - DAY
N: Marietta enters the bar on the run. She calls out to the BARTENDER...
C: MARIETTA
D: Wheres Johnnie? Hes not in his office.
C: BARTENDER
D: Havent seen im yet today, Marietta.
C: MARIETTA
D: Well I gotta find him - right this minute!
E: slightly hysterical
T: CUT TO:
S: 19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
N: Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing out a cloud of dust. Theyre both smiling.
C: LULA
D: Hey baby...
C: SAILOR
D: Peanut...
N: They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.
C: SAILOR
D: Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
C: LULA
D: Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermads at The Hurricane.
C: SAILOR
D: Stab it and steer.
E: smiling
N: Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.
T: CUT TO:
S: 20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
N: Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the fan creak.
C: LULA
D: Did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in?... Did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone?
C: SAILOR
D: I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is Gods own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin?
C: LULA
D: Well, I was thinkin about smokin actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now Ive just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? Theyre longer.
C: SAILOR
D: I guess I started smokin when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
C: LULA
D: What brandd she smoke?
C: SAILOR
D: Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
C: LULA
D: Gee, Sailor. Im sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
C: SAILOR
D: Its okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didnt have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin. He was a good ol boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
C: LULA
D: Id stand by you, Sailor ... through anything.
C: SAILOR
D: Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man cant ask for more than that.
N: Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.
C: LULA
D: You move me, Sailor, you really do. You mark me the deepest.
N: Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.
C: SAILOR
D: Youre perfect for me, too.
C: LULA
D: You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
C: SAILOR
D: In a fire, as I recall.
C: LULA
D: Started he couldnt remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask... But I dont know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
T: CUT TO:
S: 21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the cabinet contents all across the counter and floor. He puts his fist through the kitchen window. He leaps on the counter and bats the kitchen ceiling light - smashing it. He kicks over the refrigerator.
C: CLYDE
D: FUCKIN BITCH!!!!
T: CUT TO:
S: 22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
N: Lulas eyes look off, remembering.
C: LULA
D: Finally in the middle of the one night, with me and mama asleep upstairs ... he poured kerosene over himself and lit a match.
T: CUT TO:
S: 23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT
N: Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair. The drapes behind him burst in flames.
C: LULA
D: Near burned down the house. We got out just in time.
E: voice-over
N: The whole livingroom goes up in flames.
T: CUT TO:
S: 24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
N: CU the red hot ash of Lulas cigarette as she inhales deeply. As she exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.
C: LULA
D: It was a year before I met you.
N: Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the ashtray by her bed. He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.
C: SAILOR
D: You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
C: LULA
D: Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
N: Sailor drifts his thumb over Lulas left nipple then cups her breast in his hand. They kiss.
T: CUT TO:
S: 25. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
N: Marietta pours JOHNNIE FARRAGUT another shot of scotch.
C: MARIETTA
D: I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble. Hes just got some kind of influence over her I cant decipher. Theres somethin wild in Lula I dont know where it comes from. You gotta find em, Johnnie.
C: JOHNNIE
D: He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there aint much can be done about it.
C: MARIETTA
D: Dont talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and thats why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! Hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead. Youd only be defendin yourself, and with his record, nobodyd fuss.
N: Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if shes with the Ripley boy, Ill give him a talkin to and try to convince her to come back with me. Thats about all I can do.
N: He takes a long swallow from the tumbler. Marietta begins to cry. She blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started. Her grey eyes glaze over.
C: MARIETTA
D: Ill hire a hit man if you dont want to help me stop this thing. Ill call Marcello Santos.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you. And dont be gettin carried away. You dont want to be bringin Santos and his people into it.
C: MARIETTA
D: Youre just jealous of Santos cause hes sweet on me.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Darlin, you aint seein Santos again, are ya?
C: MARIETTA
D: Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Dont you trust your very own Marietta?
C: JOHNNIE
D: Sorry, sweetheart. Bein in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
C: MARIETTA
D: Well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Sailor aint a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And fars I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin Lula. Even there he was protectin her. You oughta be thankin him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin after the both of em. Why am I tellin you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
N: CU of Marietta eyes as she thinks back.
T: CUT TO:
S: 26. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: We see Marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom. Dance band music can be heard in the distance. Sailor appears coming up the hallway - slightly drunk - he carefully sets his drink on the carpet outside the MENS ROOM. Mariettas POV of Sailor entering the MENS ROOM. CU of Mariettas glazed eyes and smiling face. Mariettas POV of walking toward MENS ROOM.
T: CUT TO:
S: 27. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
C: MARIETTA
D: Maybe I was there, but I didnt see anythin. All I knows that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now probly all over my baby!
C: JOHNNIE
D: Marietta, settle down now darlin... I want whats best for her, too - Like I said, Ill do what I can to bring her home.
T: CUT TO:
S: 28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
N: Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with her hair in front of the mirror. Sailor can see her through the doorway from where he lays on the bed.
C: LULA
D: Sailor, you are somethin else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon Id be startin to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
C: SAILOR
D: But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
C: LULA
D: Thats true. Uncle Pooch wasnt really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddys? And my mama never knew nothin about me and him - thats for damn sure. His real name was somethin kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised moren a little.
C: SAILOR
D: Howd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
N: Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns. She takes a cigarette from the pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while she teases her hair.
C: LULA
D: Youre terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
C: SAILOR
D: I cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
N: Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of the sink.
C: LULA
D: I said you can be too crude sometimes? I dont think I care for it.
C: SAILOR
D: Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
C: LULA
D: Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
T: CUT TO:
S: 29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
N: We see what she talks about.
C: LULA
D: Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
E: voice-over
T: CUT TO:
S: 30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
C: SAILOR
D: Didnt he say somethin?
N: Lula shakes her head. She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and throws it into the toilet. ECU of cigarette in toilet.
C: LULA
D: Not really. Least not so I recall now.
N: Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls down the hole. ECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls.
C: SAILOR
D: So howd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
C: LULA
D: No, he picked me up.
T: CUT TO:
S: 31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAIDS ROOM - DAY
N: We see what she talks about.
C: LULA
D: He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
E: voice-over
T: CUT TO:
S: 32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
C: SAILOR
D: We did it? Whattaya mean? Didnt he force you?
C: LULA
D: Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess theres all different kinds of rapes. I didnt exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didnt seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich.
C: SAILOR
D: And you never told nobody about it?
C: LULA
D: Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
E: pause
T: CUT TO:
N: 33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a 54 Ford Pick-Up and a 64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
T: CUT TO:
S: 34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
C: LULA
D: Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space...
C: SAILOR
D: Here she goes again...
C: LULA
D: Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin. Seems to me the government could do somethin about it. One of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
N: Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.
C: SAILOR
D: That aint never will happen, honey. Least not in our lifetime.
E: laughs
N: Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs. It is a kind of wild, crazy laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.
C: SAILOR
D: You okay, honey?
C: LULA
D: That womans laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin like that... somewhere before... Soundd like the wicked witch...
C: SAILOR
D: Just sounded like an old gal havin a good time to me... You ready to dance?
C: LULA
D: Im always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
N: Lula and Sailor kiss. In the middle of the kiss, the womans creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and Lulas eyes snap open with a kind of fear.

D: Thats not why I called.
C: SANTOS
D: Oh yeah - sure ... okay.
C: MARIETTA
D: Santos... It isnt.
C: SANTOS
D: Have it your way... But you want it.

D: Lulas gone off with Sailor.
C: SANTOS
D: What do you want me to do about it?
C: MARIETTA
D: I want you to take care of Sailor, so he wont ever be able to bother my baby again.
C: SANTOS
D: Take care of him?
C: MARIETTA
D: Yes.
C: SANTOS
D: What does take care of him mean?... Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
C: MARIETTA
D: Whats with you?... You know what take care of him means. I dont call Santos except for one big reason.
C: SANTOS
D: Big is the key word, and Im telling you I want it bad.
C: MARIETTA
D: I want you to get rid of Sailor.
C: SANTOS
D: Get rid of him?
C: MARIETTA
D: Yes... Get rid of him.
C: SANTOS
D: How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
C: MARIETTA
D: Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin this stupid game?
C: SANTOS
D: Just tell me what you want.
C: MARIETTA
D: I dont need to explain anymoren I have... You know damn well.
C: SANTOS
D: You need to explain it.
C: MARIETTA
D: All right... I want you ... to ... kill ... Sailor... As simple as that.
C: SANTOS
D: Simple? Kill him?... How?
C: MARIETTA
D: Thats your business... I dont care how.
C: SANTOS
D: Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
C: MARIETTA
D: NO... For Gods sakes, Santos!
C: SANTOS
D: Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
C: MARIETTA
D: Santos...
C: SANTOS
D: Explain it... I told you.
C: MARIETTA
D: Shoot him.
C: SANTOS
D: Shoot him? Like with a gun?
C: MARIETTA
D: Yes.
C: SANTOS
D: Where?... In the leg?
C: MARIETTA
D: No.
C: SANTOS
D: Where?
C: MARIETTA
D: In the head.
C: SANTOS
D: Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now Im beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
C: MARIETTA
D: Yes.
C: SANTOS
D: But where in the head?... Not the chin, I hope.
C: MARIETTA
D: No... In the brains... What little Im sure he has.
C: SANTOS
D: You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
C: MARIETTA
D: Yes.
C: SANTOS
D: Through the forehead?
C: MARIETTA
D: Yes.
C: SANTOS
D: Wrong! Its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head ... right toward the bridge of the nose ... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
C: MARIETTA
D: See! I knew you had it all under control.
C: SANTOS
D: Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?
C: MARIETTA
D: Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that town.
C: SANTOS
D: On one condition...
N: He pauses and smiles strangely.
C: SANTOS
D: You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
C: MARIETTA
D: Santos... No... Please, Santos...
E: whisper
C: SANTOS
D: Youre not tellin me that youre sweet on him?
C: MARIETTA
D: No... But...
C: SANTOS
D: One day hes gonna find out what were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
N: They stare at each other for a moment.
C: SANTOS
D: Im gonna take your silence as a yes...
C: MARIETTA
D: Santos... I cant...
C: SANTOS
D: Shhhh... Its all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
C: MARIETTA
D: You fucker, dont you ever touch Lula - You fucker, Ill kill you.
C: SANTOS
D: Put your shoulders back.
E: laughing
C: MARIETTA
D: What?
C: SANTOS
D: Put your shoulders back, I said.
N: Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of her.
C: SANTOS
D: You got nice tits.
C: MARIETTA
D: Someones gonna see us.
C: SANTOS
D: Thats just another part of the price to pay.
E: smiling as he starts to feel her breasts
C: MARIETTA
D: Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise hes gonna turn my baby against me.
N: Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up towards his.
C: SANTOS
D: Look at me... Theres no turning back on this... Im gonna kill Sailor... Thats for sure.
T: CUT TO:
S: 36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT
N: We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - as if in a hurricane. Two leaning palm trees border the sign. One hundred decibels of speed metal. We see the name Powermad on the bass drum. The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one. Sailor grabs Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical storm. a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula. They thought theyd seen everything. CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot. An IDIOT PUNK moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.

In the pile are four ready-made, plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, extra salted.
C: BLACK MAN

C: ERV
D: This be it?
C: BLACK MAN
D: Yall take American Express?
C: ERV
D: Yessir.
C: BLACK MAN
D: Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
N: Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.
C: BLACK MAN
D: Pussycats gotta eat, too.
E: to Sailor, smiling - showing no visible upper teeth
N: He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through the verifier. The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.
C: BLACK MAN
D: Id just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if its same to you.
E: to Erv
C: ERV
D: We dont have no paper bags.
E: shoving the plastic bag he filled towards the black man
N: A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around. The Black Man reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches send.
C: BLACK MAN
D: Hello... Yeah, mama, Im on my way... Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.
E: into phone to Sailor and other guy as he picks up his bag and heads out
N: Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.
C: SAILOR
D: All I wants ten bucks regular. Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.
E: to Erv
N: Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays it on the counter. Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.
C: SAILOR
D: I aint got my American Express card with me, so I gotta use cash. Hope thats okay.
N: Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his change. The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.
S: 75. EXT. MINI MART/THUNDERBIRD - DAY
N: Sailor goes back to the car.
C: LULA
D: That took long enough. You forget my Mounds?
N: Sailor tosses her the candy bar.
C: SAILOR
D: I really do think the country done changed just a little while I was away, peanut.
N: Lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate-covered coconut.
C: LULA
D: You got to keep an eye on it. Thats sure.
E: as she chews
N: Sailor starts pumping gas.

N: At a table near the window, Johnnie takes a man-sized pull off his Dixie beer in between bites of an oyster sandwich. A large, chocolate-colored man in his early thirties, REGINALD SAN PEDRO SULA, and a smaller white man, DROP SHADOW approach with their trays of food.
C: REGGIE
D: Do you mind if we share this table? ... The others, they are occupied.
N: Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he looks the men over quickly.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
E: cautiously
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Muchas gracias.
E: as he sits down
C: REGGIE
D: My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula. But please do call me Reggie. This is my friend, who we call Drop Shadow. He is always with me.
N: Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Johnnie Farragut. Pleased to meet ya.
N: Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their meal before saying anything more.
C: REGGIE
D: You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
C: JOHNNIE
D: Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
N: Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
C: REGGIE
D: Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
C: JOHNNIE
D: Only that its supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
C: REGGIE
D: Yes, thats so. But there is not much to destroy.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: No big buildings like in New Orleans.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Whattaya do there?
C: REGGIE
D: Oh, many things...
E: laughs
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance shop.
C: REGGIE
D: But I am also with the government.

C: REGGIE
D: In many capacities.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the Secret Service.

E: reading aloud
C: REGGIE
D: He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his operatives.
N: Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece of paper, folded once. Johnnie unfolds it. The printing is in Spanish.
C: REGGIE
D: That is my permiso.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.
C: REGGIE
D: Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country.
E: laughs
C: JOHNNIE
D: Of course.
N: Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to carry a .45.
C: REGGIE
D: United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
N: Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on the floor beneath his chair.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Why are you in New Orleans? If you dont mind my askin.
C: REGGIE
D: Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
C: REGGIE
D: We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
N: Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Its been a real pleasure. I wish you both buena suerte wherever you go.
E: extending his hand
N: Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up. They shake Johnnies hand.
C: REGGIE
D: The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
C: JOHNNIE
D: I couldnt say, which one?
N: Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line.
C: DROP SHADOW
D: Who cares?
E: grinning

C: LULA
D: I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of em. Oh, Sailor youre so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes its like its talkin to me when youre inside? Like its got a voice all its own. You get right on me.
C: SAILOR
D: You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
N: Lula lights a cigarette.
C: SAILOR
D: Lets head out into the crazy world of New Orleans... I gotta get somethin to eat.

C: GEORGE
D: My names George Kovich. Bet youve heard of me.
C: SAILOR
D: Dont know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin in particular?
C: GEORGE
D: Was in all the papers three years ago. Im seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted em killed.
C: LULA
D: Why were you killin pigeons, Mr. Kovich? Were you in the extermination business?
C: GEORGE
D: No, maam. I was a housepainter, in the union forty-one years. Im retired now, livin with my sister, Ida. Ida moved down here twenty-five years ago, married an oil man named Smoltz, Ed Smoltz. Hes dead now, so its just me and Ida. I sold my house and moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business. Hell, RWW was doin them a service, and they charged me with endangerin the public.
C: LULA
D: Whats wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich?
C: GEORGE
D: Theyre useless pests. Ive shot hundreds of em...

S: 84. INT. RONNIES NOTHIN FANCY CAFE - NEW ORLEANS - LATE EVENING
C: GEORGE
D: Shes stone deaf but the racket the pigeons made drove Earl crazy. He could hear em even with the TV on. He owned a bar thirty years, The Boilermaker, on Wyoming Street. Earls roof was a favorite spot for pigeons. They lit there day and night. I wanted to toss a grenade up there.
C: SAILOR
D: If your neighbors didnt mind, howd you get put out of business?
C: GEORGE
D: Woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didnt understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebodys cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didnt make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
C: SAILOR
D: What happened on the charges?
C: GEORGE
D: Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
N: Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter.
C: GEORGE
D: Its a serious situation. Not like the Turks and the Armenians, maybe, or the Arabs and the Jews, but I want people to remember me and what Ive done and pick up where I left off. Somebody had to make a move. It was nice meetin you folks.
N: George Kovich nods and leaves.
C: SAILOR
D: What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
C: LULA
D: Its just another case, Sailor.
C: SAILOR
D: Whats that, peanut?

C: LULA
D: Sailor?... Sailor, honey?
N: Sailor snaps awake with a snort.
C: SAILOR
D: Huh?
C: LULA
D: Ever imagine what itd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast?... Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
C: SAILOR

E: looks around
C: LULA
D: Shhhhh... Its four oclock... That womans laugh the other day had somethin to do with this feelin? ... Like bein ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
N: Lulas left hand opens and spreads wide.
C: SAILOR
D: Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
C: LULA
D: Anythin interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like were seein these days?
C: SAILOR
D: You got me, peanut.
C: LULA
D: You certain?
E: smiles - turns to him
C: SAILOR
D: I aint never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
C: LULA
D: Recall the time we was sittin one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, You feel it beatin in there, Lula?... Get used to it, cause it belongs to you now. Dyou recall that?

C: LULA
D: Talkins good. Long as you got the other? Im a big believer in talkin, case you aint noticed.
C: SAILOR
D: Too bad they dont give an award for talkin... Youd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
C: LULA
D: You think so, baby? Does my talkin bother you, honey?
C: SAILOR
D: No, I like gettin up around four a.m. and talkin bout wild animals ... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didnt remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldnt remember any of my dreams.
C: LULA
D: What was this one?

C: LULA
D: Oh, baby, what an idea. Id always be happy to see you, no matter what.
C: SAILOR
D: I know, peanut. But it wasnt all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein there was upsettin to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess youd got married and your husband was comin home any minute.
T: CUT TO:

C: LULA
D: Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
C: SAILOR
D: Hes just a regular guyt needs help, honey. Look at him.
N: The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is carrying a large, covered cardboard box. He is filthy, with an uneven smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth. Lula opens the door for him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.
C: ROACH
D: Thanks a lot. I been standin out there off and on for two hours, ha-ha! Since noon about, ha-ha! Cops catch ya hitchin on a Interstate around here they throw ya on a county road crew for a week, less you can pay the ticket, ha-ha! Which I aint got, ha-ha!

N: Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of them twice with a religiously unwashed hand. The dogs whimper and lick his dirty fingers.
C: ROACH
D: I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha! The Call of the Wild. I aint never seen snow, ha-ha! I got these dogs at the pound. Nobody wanted em, ha-ha! Everbody here got theirself pit bulls or some kinda hounds. Im gonna feed these boys good so theyll be big and powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

E: screeches as she sees this
N: Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops. Lula opens her door and jumps out.
C: LULA
D: Im sorry, but I cant take this. Roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant!
N: Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box of tiny canines after him. Once he and his belongings are deposited on the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.
C: LULA
D: Im truly sorry? Im truly sorry, Roach. But aint gonna make it to Alaska? Least not any part of the way with us. Youd best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die? And, if you dont mind my sayin so? You could most certainly use some serious lookin after yourself, startin with a bath!
N: Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.
C: LULA
D: Drive.
N: Sailor takes off.
C: SAILOR
D: You dont feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
C: LULA
D: I know youre thinkin that I got moren some of my mama in me? Well, I couldnt help it. Sailor, I really couldnt. Im sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!

N: The livingroom is on fire. The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom. The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window. Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

C: SAILOR
D: I dont know... Looks like clothes.
N: Sailor starts to slow down. The highway is suddenly littered with clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side of the road. Sailor slows down to a crawl. He and Lula turn to each other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES. One close to the side of the highway - and other just off in the desert brush. Off behind is an overturned car.
C: LULA
D: Oh God, Sailor.
C: SAILOR
D: One bad car accident...

C: SAILOR
D: Dont know, but shes gonna bleed all over our car, Ill tell ya that... Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
E: to Girl
N: Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.
C: GIRL
D: OWWW GOD!!! LEAVE ME ALONE... ROBERT!!!... Shit, I got this damn sticky stuff in my hair...
N: She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.
C: GIRL
D: Gotta find my wallet. Dont you say one word of this to my mother. God, shes gonna kill me.
E: to Sailor
N: The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up. Sailor and Lula each take an arm and try to help her.
C: GIRL
D: WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...
N: Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.
C: LULA
D: I cant take this, Sailor. Shes dyin right in front of our eyes...
C: SAILOR
D: Im afraid she is, baby.
N: Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her forehead.
C: GIRL
D: Get my lipstick... Its in my purse.
E: wide-eyed now whisper
N: The girl dies. Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment. Lula starts to cry.
C: LULA
D: She died right in front of me. Whyd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
C: SAILOR
D: Lets get outta here, honey.
N: Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead down over her eyes - closing them. He puts his hand on her cheek then gets up. He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car. Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her. He goes around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder. Sailor starts the car and takes off.

S: 136A. EXT. ROARITAS - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of the Eldorado. He peels back a brown army blanket.
C: BOBBY
D: Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off, Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape. Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson .32 handgun with a six inch barrel. Thesell do er... Loosen up that five grand... Two and a half for you and the little lady...
N: Bobby closes the trunk. Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.

C: LULA
D: Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
N: Sailor gets into bed.
C: SAILOR
D: You shouldnt be smokin if youre pregnant. Aint smart.
N: Lula sticks a More between her lips and lights it. She takes a deep drag, blows out the smoke, and stares at Sailor.
C: LULA
D: Who says Im smart? You up to somethin with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
C: SAILOR
D: What could I be up to, Lula?
C: LULA
D: Hes a stone fuckin criminal, honey, and you aint.
C: SAILOR

C: SAILOR
D: Lula, I got to get some sleep.
C: LULA
D: Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
C: SAILOR
D: What?
C: LULA
D: Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped em in a trench. Bobby Peru probly killed the most.
C: SAILOR
D: Lula, he mighta did, I dont know. But it dont matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it aint their fault.
N: Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.
C: LULA
D: I sure enjoy smokin, Sailor. I hate that its bad for you.
N: Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his head.
C: LULA
D: That mans a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, youll regret it. If you live to.
C: S AILOR
D: Thanks, darlin, I know you got my best interest in mind, and I preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
N: Lula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on the dresser top.
C: LULA
D: This whole worlds wild at heart and weird on top.
N: Lula turns over, away from Sailor.
C: LULA
D: I wish you really, truly loved me... I wish youd sing me Love Me Tender ... I wish I was somewhere over that rainbow... Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

N: Sailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is called by BOB RAY LEMON, who is coming down towards them fast. Marietta stands at the top - watching.
C: BOB RAY
D: Hey Sailor... Wait a minute... I got somethin for ya.
N: As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her legs. Sailor starts to see red. Bob Ray smiles and steps down to Sailor. He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.
C: BOB RAY
D: Shit, man... Marietta says you been tryin to fuck her in the toilets for the past ten minutes... You crazy fuckin bad boy tryin to fuck your girls mama... How do you think that cute little cunt Lula would feel about that? Hey, take a look at this... Marietta just gave me this to kill you right now, and afterward she said Lula was mine to fuck all the way into next Sunday.
E: shows Sailor one thousand dollars in cash
N: Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob Rays brain. From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone. Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead at the foot of the stairs. The crowd of formally dressed onlookers stand aghast. Sailor stares up at Marietta. Both their eyes burning with hate.

N: Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall.
C: BOBBY
D: Stayin a few extra days in the big N.O., huh? This you?
N: Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.
C: PERDITA
D: Yes.
N: We see the photo now. In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie.

C: PERDITA
D: Whats gonna happen when he sees me drivin the car tomorrow?
C: BOBBY
D: Maybe hell get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
N: Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her breasts. She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette. Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch onto the floor. Neither of them speak. She tries to stand, but Bobby keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded wrist. Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away. She stand up and spits at him.

E: grinning
T: CUT TO:
S: 141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY
N: Lula lays very still on the bed. Her head is close to the small turquoise radio on the bedside table. She is listening to a piece of sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the volume increases. Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues over) When he kissed her outside the jail gate. When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail. When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier. When they danced to Slaughter House. Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize. She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking through it at her. The image puzzles her. (The Music continues over)

D: Panty hose. Work bettern stockins. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol. Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, theyll know we aint foolin with em.

C: DEPUTY
D: Waitin for somebody, Miss?
C: PERDITA
D: Mi esposo. Hes in the feed store picking up some supplies.
C: DEPUTY

S: 146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY
N: The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind the counter. Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money. Sailor is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys. When Bobby finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole through the chest of one of the old men. Sailor goes into shock.
C: SAILOR
D: BOBBY!!!! STOP IT, MAN!!!

N: Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now. Bobby spins his shotgun around and points it at Sailor.
C: BOBBY
D: Youre next, fucker.
N: The second old man is reaching under the counter. Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby. There are no live bullets in his pistol. It just makes a dry click. Bobby smiles and is just about to kill Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own. Bobby instinctively spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the old gentleman. As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the front door. Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.
S: 148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY
N: The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped in both hands. He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his second into Bobbys left hip. The shock of the initial slug causes Bobby to drop the bag. The impact of the second forces Bobbys right hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under his chin. The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store. Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls. He puts his hand over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy orders him to stand up.

C: MARIETTA
D: Oh baby, I was beginnin to think I was never gonna see you again.
N: Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks. She holds Lula to her and Lula does not resist. Lula just stares at Santos.
C: MARIETTA
D: Youre comin home, precious. Santos gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
C: LULA
D: Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here. I just cant leave him.
N: Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her. Lulas eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are pale.
C: MARIETTA
D: Oh, yes, you can.
N: Santos steps forward. Lula begins to tremble.
C: SANTOS
D: Your mamas been real worried bout you, honey. Me too... Can you give your old friend Santos a hug, too?
N: Santos arms begin to go around Lula. Lula lets out a blood-curdling scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree. Santos grabs her hard - in a bear hug. On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, orange, and silver.

Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a boy or a girl. Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it? Its kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old when you get out. I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to show for it. Our child!! I love you Sailor. I dont know how much or what it means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know youre thinking about me cause I can feel it. I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that. Mama married Santos. It just about drove me crazy. My daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending it like there is no tomorrow. Im going to move out as soon as I can. Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin at the two of us in a different light - whatever that means. Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared. No one knows where. I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you. Time dont really fly honey does it? Love, your Lula P.S. I miss dancing...

He would be proud I know though he is long passed. Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound so bad do you think? This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee. Not pretty at all. There are boys inside these walls meaner than Peru you can bet. There is a Death House. I am getting along. The only thing is not thinking about the future. I miss dancing with you, too. I love you. It is hard to end this letter. If I stop writing youre gone. There is not a lot more to say though. Vava con dios mi amor. Sailor

D: Course he aint never killed nobody. Whyd you say that, Pace?
C: PACE
D: Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin.
C: LULA
D: And?
C: PACE
D: Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
C: LULA
D: Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didnt hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy aint always been so lucky... Were almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
T: CUT TO:
S: 157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING
N: Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the engine.
C: PACE
D: Why we sittin here, mama?
C: LULA
D: Thinkin a second, baby.
N: Lula gets out and goes around for Pace. They hold hands as they walk toward the station. The big clock on the side of the building shows ten minutes past six.
C: PACE
D: Im scared, mama.
C: LULA
D: Why, honey?
C: PACE
D: Case daddy dont like me. What if he dont like that I dont got his color hair.
C: LULA
D: Pace, your daddyd love you even if you didnt have no hair at all.
T: CUT TO:
S: 158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING
N: Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door. He is sitting in an orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette.
C: LULA
D: Still partial to Camels, huh?
N: Sailor smiles.
C: SAILOR
D: First pack of tailor-mades I had in a while.
N: He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with Lula. Sailor puts out his right hand.
C: SAILOR
D: You must be my son.
C: LULA
D: Shake hands with your daddy.
N: Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors. Sailor grips it gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.
C: SAILOR
D: Pleasure to meet you, Pace. I read a lot about you.
N: Sailor looks at Lula. Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them loose. Sailor tries to smile.
C: LULA
D: You hungry? Pace and I aint had dinner yet.
C: SAILOR
D: Lead the way.
N: Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.
T: CUT TO:
S: 159. INT. LULAS CAR - NIGHT
N: Lula drives.
C: SAILOR
D: No rag top, huh?
N: Lula starts to reply, then stops. She stares straight ahead, gripping the wheel hard. Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns off the engine and gets out of the car.
C: PACE
D: Whats wrong, mama?
C: SAILOR
D: Dont worry, son. Just stay here.
E: turning to Pace and patting his head
N: Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the hood.
C: LULA
D: Im sorry, Sailor. I just cant help it. Give me a minute and Ill quit.
C: SAILOR
D: Boys frightened, Lula. This aint no good.
C: LULA
D: Really, Sail, Ill be okay.
C: SAILOR
D: Its a mistake, honey. You two go on. Ill walk back to the depot.
C: LULA
D: Whatre you talkin about? Thats your son in there.
C: SAILOR
D: He aint never known me, Lula, so there aint much for him to forget. Not seein each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
C: LULA
D: How can you say that, Sailor?
C: SAILOR
D: What makes sense, is all.
N: Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys out of the ignition. He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and closes the lid.
C: LULA
D: Dont do this, Sailor, please.
N: Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the car.
C: SAILOR
D: Oiga, amigo. If ever somethin dont feel right to you, remember what Pancho said to The Cisco Kid... Lets went, before we are dancing at the end of a rope, without music.
E: to Pace
N: Sailor stands up and looks at Lula. Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks down her face. ECU of Lulas eyes. Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.
C: SAILOR
D: You been doin fine without me, peanut. There aint no need to make life toughern it has to be.
N: He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks away. She lets him go.
T: CUT TO:
S: 160. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care.
T: CUT TO:
S: 161. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing. Pace sits sadly, staring out the window.
T: CUT TO:
S: 162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: Sailor continues walking down the street. A GANG OF INSANE KILLER TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor. They circle around him, coming in closer for the kill.
C: SAILOR
D: What do you faggots want?
N: Thats all it takes. The gang is on him. Sailor tries to defend himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out. Blood begins to pour from his swelling nose.
S: 162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it. In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.
C: GOOD WITCH
D: Sailor Ripley...
N: Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids. His mouth speaks through closed lips.
C: SAILOR
D: The Good Witch...
C: GOOD WITCH
D: Sailor... Lula loves you.
C: SAILOR
D: But Im a robber and a manslaughterer and I havent had any parental guidance.
C: GOOD WITCH
D: Shes forgiven you of all these things ... You love her... Dont be afraid, Sailor.
C: SAILOR
D: But Im wild at heart.
C: GOOD WITCH
D: If you are truly wild at heart, youll fight for your dreams... Dont turn away from love, Sailor... Dont turn away from love... Dont turn away from love.
N: The Good Witch disappears.
S: 162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on his feet. The gang still stands around him.
C: GANG MEMBER
D: You had enough, asshole?
C: SAILOR
D: Yes, I have... And I wanna apologize to you gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals. I also want to thank you fellas, youve taught me a valuable lesson in life. LULA!!!!
E: lifts his head high
N: Sailor turns around and starts running back. The gang watches him go.
T: CUT TO:
S: 163. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam. She is still crying and horns are honking all around them.
T: CUT TO:
S: 164. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
N: Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME. He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars. He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he jumps on the hood of Lulas car. She sees him.
C: SAILOR
D: LULA!!!!
C: LULA
D: SAILOR!!!!
N: Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms. Behind them is a giant golden sunset. As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes away. Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield. It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, but now she knows what it is. It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking up at the two of them in love. Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love Me Tender. The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a feeling of love and happiness in their hearts. THE END
