S: EXT. QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1
N: A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation. Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their walk. MIIï¿½ is singing. The others are humming along. The melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie" but it's a loose version. MIME AND WHEN I DIE...WON'T YOU BURY ME ON THE"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND P BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS AND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS I HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R TO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P. I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR TO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL. By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a large trophy.
C: DAVE
D: Bravo, Mike! Bravo! Bellisimot
C: CYRIL
D: Did you really make all that up? They pass.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed by them. They have to climb over some.
C: MIKE
D: I sent away for this stuff from Wyoming. It'll tell you everything. Since you don't believe me maybe you'll believe it when you see it.
C: CYRIL
D: And we'd work on the same ranch and sleep in the bunkhouse together, eh? Cont.

C: CYRIL
D: Are you really going to shave your legs?
C: DAVE
D: Certo. All the Italians do it.
C: MIKE
D: That's some country. The women don't shave theirs.

C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: They are now standing above a huge pool of water with sheer cliffs on three sides. Abandoned derricks loom in the distance. Dave is now humming softly a Neapolitan song. They begin the descent.
C: CYRIL
D: I kind of miss school. You know. This will be the first time nobody's going to ask us to write a theme about how we spent our summer.

N: MIKE (TEACHER'S VOICE) Sex spelled backwards x-es.

N: REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 6/16/78 4 ROCKS BY THE WATER 1-B All four guys are sunbathing looking at the water. Deep X down, at the bottom of the quarry hole we see an old icebox. Mike is staring at it. The mood is one of total relaxation.

E: shakes his head
C: MIKE
D: How come you're so stupid, Cyril.
C: CYRIL
D: I don't know. I think I have a dumb heredity. What's your excuse, Mike? Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up. He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys talk as they follow his progress.
C: DAVE
D: You hear from your folks, Moocher? 567 Cont.
N: REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12/78 5 1-B Coat. MOOCHER .. Yeah, my Dad called. He says there's a lot more jobs in'Chicago. He hasn't got anything yet. Mike has reached the icebox. He opens the door. Goes in. Shuts the door.
C: MOOCHER
D: He wanted to know if the house was sold. They could use the money.
C: DAVE
D: You can come and live with me when it's sold. In Italy everybody lives together. All three of them are getting concerned about Mike.
C: MOOCHER
D: Ever since you won that Italian X bike you've been acting weird. You really think you are Italian.
C: CYRIL
D: I .wouldn't mind thinking I was s omebody myself. All three of them stand up.
C: MOOCHER
D: Maybe the door is stuck. God dammit! Moocher dives in. Dave and Cyril follow. Moocher swims down to the icebox, forces the door open. They surface. As soon as they hit the surface we hear:

D: ï¿½o.s.} Yoo--hoo .
C: THE GUYS' P.O.V.
D: They see Mike standing on top of the rock above them.
C: MIKE
D: It's got no back on it! He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other side of the quarry hole, we see several figures. The guys are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too. 5667 Cont.

D: Dave, Moocher and Cyril are standing on the rocks below Mike. Mike is still on top of the rock. High above him are the College Kids. Three guys and three girls. One of the guys is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful somersault into a swan dive.
N: CLOSEUP - OUR GUYS They are stunned. CLOSEUP - MIKE He's obviously envious.. He looks from the diver toward the guys and seems to feel his position undermined.

S: EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 6
N: Huge modern structures are looming in the distance in stark contrast to the town we just passed through. Mike's car-is speeding toward them. X
S: EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 7
N: Mike's car turns into a street called Fraternity Row.- Most of the fraternities and sororities-are located along this stretch. Neat lawns line the area. The houses are enormous: an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel. The college kids are outside on the lawns. Some are reading. Girls in bikinis sunbathing. Guys washing their cars. Some other guys passing the football around. Transistor radios playing. Mike drives slowly.
S: INT. MIKE'S CAR
N: All the guys are looking out of the windows as if they were in a museum. Mike looks at the expensive cars along the way. Cyril looks at the Girls in bikinis. Moocher looks at the huge well-built guys. Dave just looks.
C: CYRIL
D: Going to college must do'something 'to girls' tits. Just look at them. Campussies and sororititties. - Hi, there. What's your major? The Girls look up and kind of sneer.
E: sticks head out; shouts to a couple of Girls
C: MOOCHER

C: CYRIL
D: I wonder what it's like to kiss a coed. I wonder about it a lot. Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give' Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, those bastards are giving us the finger. He slams on the brakes.
C: MOOCHER
D: Hey, c'mon, Mike. We're on their turf. Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning the car.
C: MIKE
D: They think they own the place.
C: MOOCHER
D: They do.
C: CYRIL
D: Besides, you've humiliated them enough. In ancient Japan when you ran over a samurai's Frisbee he had to commit suicide. Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road. The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop, but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in the direction he came from. Cont.

Dave pulls off to let him take the lead but as he does the lst Italian pulls up behind him to block his way back. The 3RD ITALIAN sprints up front to block his way forward. Dave is trapped. The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The 4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues. He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry.
