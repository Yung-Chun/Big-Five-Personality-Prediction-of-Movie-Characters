S: EXT. BAR, LAE, NEW GUINEA - DAY
N: CLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving RAIN. A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the- art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting. PULL BACK to see... ...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open- sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And peering down through the mist and rain... ...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane. Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her. Something fierce lives there. SUPERIMPOSE: LAE, NEW GUINEA - 1937.
C: FRED
D: Sure I can't talk you inta somethin' more adventurous? She turns. FRED NOONAN is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt- streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a Coke which he sets down for her.
E: O.S.
C: AMELIA
D: Adventurous? You've got the wrong girl, Mister. You should know that by now. Her eyes study him. Assessing something as he pours himself four fingers.
C: FRED
D: Actually. I knew that the moment I met ol' George. He sips his drink. She says nothing.
C: FRED
D: I like how you don't talk about him.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: That why I get so many chances to not do it?
C: FRED
D: Well. Natural curiosity. His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila. She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her side of the table.
C: FRED
D: I mean, why would a guy who needs to run the show. Pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail?
N: No response. Just her clear direct gaze.
C: FRED
D: I'll bet he knew that. First time he met you.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks out to sea.
C: AMELIA
D: He thought I hated him. He never knew I was fascinated.
S: INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY
N: Alone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now, there are none to be seen. Even as... ...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad. Does he know she's there? SUPERIMPOSE: NEW YORK, LATER 1937.
C: GEORGE
D: The first time I met her she sat in that chair. The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down. And still with his back to her...
E: without turning
C: GEORGE
D: You may as well write it down, Mary. Write it all down. Even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring. He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: We'll see if I remember how to edit. She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as...
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: I'd kept her waiting two hours.
E: CONT'D
N: She hated me on sight, but she hought I couldn't tell. His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile.
C: GEORGE
D: She was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work. And there I was... His smile is kind. And honestly self-mocking.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances. A vain, fast- talking, manipulator. But then I guess you know all that, don't you? She looks up reproachfully. Nothing of the kind, and you know it.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, yes. And the kind of man who fishes for compliments. He's made her laugh.
E: CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO...
S: INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY
N: She is younger, dressed conservatively. The calm at the center of a storm. Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an exam. SUPERIMPOSE: G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS PUBLISHING CO. 1928.
C: GEORGE
D: The waiting made her furious. She undoubtedly felt I was
E: V.O.
N: stablishing my dominance and importance. She doesn't look furious at all. Thumbing through WE by COL. CHARLES LINDBERGH. Photos of Lindy beside the Spirit of St. Louis in Paris.
C: GEORGE
D: Actually, I hadn't given her a thought. Oblivious as usual. Which, perhaps, was even worse. Now, SKYWARD by ADM. RICHARD BYRD. Photos of the explorer preparing for his flight over the North Pole. One of Byrd with George himself, displaying considerable gravitas.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I figured he'd be pompous. Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers, explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of George with the great Lindbergh. A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises, smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down the corridor.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: I knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me. I had no discernible qualifications whatsoever. They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly pushes it open... ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him, negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric, masterful.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: But to be rejected by this... parasite. A man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous. He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is there. Sit, please. But she doesn't.
E: V.O
C: AMELIA
D: I didn't know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk. He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze from him. He hangs up the phone. They stare at each other for a frozen beat. He breaks the moment with a charming smile...
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Miss Earhart?
C: AMELIA
D: Mr. Putnam? GEORGE I asked you to sit.
E: softly
C: AMELIA
D: Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog. His smile now only a trace. But more genuine.
C: GEORGE
D: A Ah. Well, stand if you like. melia sits.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm told you want to fly the Atlantic Ocean.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I do.
C: GEORGE
D: In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have died.
C: AMELIA
D: I'll make it.
C: GEORGE
D: Three women died trying. Two others escaped with their lives. If you do make it, you'd be the first. Which...is the real attraction for both of us, I suspect. She nods. No smile.
C: AMELIA
D: Always nice to know what the real attraction is. His smile. Beginning to enjoy this conversation.
C: GEORGE
D: The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. She has asked for a replacement... He gestures. Perhaps you.
C: GEORGE
D: ...who is American, educated, well- spoken, a flyer, preferably physically attractive...
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Why would that matter?
C: GEORGE
D: Because she wants the world to pay attention. And pretty girls command more attention.
C: AMELIA
D: Was that your advice?
C: GEORGE
D: Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name. Understood...? G
C: EORGE
D: But all the money from these will go to Mrs. Guest.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Except for the part that goes to you.
C: GEORGE
D: Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you.
C: AMELIA
D: You said she wants a flyer.
C: GEORGE
D: Don't get your hopes up. The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger.
N: He waits for reaction. She keeps her mouth shut.
C: GEORGE
D: That's good for your chances. Because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. If the woman were to do any flying at all. No punches pulled. Not his style.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Why would anyone want a book from a passenger?
C: GEORGE
D: Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her flight.
C: AMELIA
D: Good for my chances, you said. What are my chan...
C: GEORGE
D: The job's yours. She blinks. Stunned speechless.
C: GEORGE
D: I chose you the moment you walked through the door. He smiles his charming smile. Several phones are RINGING.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Now assuming my awful manners haven't soured you on the enterprise. May I give you a lift to the station? Amelia rises. Is she pissed at being toyed with?
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam. I can find my way. The look holds. He shrugs. You probably can.
S: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - LATER
N: Two figures on the platform. Her train is ready to leave.
C: GEORGE
D: I honestly feel an apology is in order.
C: AMELIA
D: Fine. What have I done? She watches his smile.
C: AMELIA
D: I didn't mind waiting. Caught up on my reading. Knitted a sweater.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: I mean an apology. For what's coming. His voice softens.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm going to be pretty controlling these next few months. How you dress, move, cut your hair. Speak in public. It's all part of the package we're selling.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: We.
C: GEORGE
D: That's right. If you're not in there selling with me, it won't work. The smile turns friendly.
C: GEORGE
D: You're the star. I'm no one at all.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Spoken like a gentleman. She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man. He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches his cheery wave as she rolls away.
C: AMELIA
D: Of course a gentleman. Would have paid for my ticket.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. TRAIN - LATER
N: Gazing out the window as she rattles toward Boston. She looks down now to a notebook in her lap. As she flips pages, we see it is a collection of hand-written POEMS and thoughts. She writes...
C: AMELIA
D: Courage is the price that life exacts For granting peace We SUPERIMPOSE over her image the wall of a little girl's bedroom, filled with treasured NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS about women doctors, officials, bank presidents, women who had established themselves in positions previously thought to be available only to men.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: The soul that knows it not Knows no release From little things
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO HER
N: MEMORY OF...
S: EXT. FIELD, DES MOINES - DAY
N: Two LITTLE GIRLS, maybe 10 years old, walking in a field. Amelia and a girlfriend. They stop, hearing... The DRONING of an engine, a small red plane APPEARING above the treetops. The pilot seeing two girls alone in the field, SWOOPS down to BUZZ them. Amelia's friend runs for her life. But Amelia stands still, throws her arms WIDE, and the plane... ...DROPS lower, and LOWER, as it CLOSES straight in on the slender girl with her outstretched arms. LOUDER and FASTER, as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills. The aircraft SCREAMS past, just above her head.
C: AMELIA
D: As the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me. Amelia beams. She fills her lungs, transported.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: I don't think I've ever stopped listening. HOLD on her, hair and uniform whipping in the breeze.
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: SMASH CUT TO...
S: INT. AMELIA'S PLANE - DAY
N: Amelia flying her little yellow Kinner. Feeling the freedom she thrilled to as a A child.
C: MELIA
D: Ten years, 28 jobs and an unspeak- able number of crashes later, I hadn't changed my mind. She LIFTS the nose of the tiny craft. Begins to CLIMB.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: I even had my own plane. Bought with my last dime. At the apex of her climb, she FLIPS into a breathtaking LOOP THE LOOP, as...
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Course in the early days of flying... ...her engine SPUTTERS. Then STALLS. The plane DIPS into a TAIL-SPIN, PLUNGING downward...
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: ...crashing was so common, you almost forgot it could kill you... Amelia STRUGGLING to start the engine, the little plane HURTLING toward earth, SPINNING as it goes.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: ...until it did. The engine COUGHS to life and at the last second she SWOOPS harrowingly above the ground to SOAR FREE.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Almost.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
N: A small HANGAR in a lonely field. See a group of... ...MECHANICS in their grease-stained jumpsuits. Three big guys and one little one working on an engine that's been pulled from Amelia's Kinner. When the little guy comes up for air... ...he isn't a guy at all.
C: AMELIA
D: Got it. I think.
S: INT. DENISON HOUSE, BOSTON - DAY
N: SAM CHAPMAN, a handsome young man is being led down an institutional hallway and out onto the grounds of this venerable settlement house. He finds... ...Amelia sitting cross-legged on the grass. Reading to a group of CHINESE GIRLS, who hang on her every animated word. On the periphery, ADULTS sit, taking in the story. They are of various ethnicities, homeless or handicapped or immigrant. Two are blind. Amelia sees Sam...
C: MELIA
D: Girls, this is Mr. Samuel Chapman. Sam, say hullo to the Octopus Club. The Octopus Club waves to Sam. The adults wave, too.
C: AMELIA
D: You're just in time. Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well...
E: CONT'D
C: OCTOPUS CLUB
E: on cue
N: REALLY STRANGE!
C: AMELIA
D: They are, actually. She pats the grass beside her. Sam has no choice but to sit.
S: EXT. GROUNDS - LATER
N: Amelia and Sam walk a wooded path beside the grounds. Through the chain link fence, they watch other social workers playing with groups of children.
C: SAM
D: And it's a secret.
C: AMELIA
D: Has to be. Competition, you know. Millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots. If George knew I told you, he'd have me publicly flogged.
N: She looks over.
C: AMELIA
D: So long as he could sell tickets. He's not smiling.
E: CONT'D
C: SAM
D: And no one else knows.
C: AMELIA
D: Marion. She's giving me a leave of absence.
C: SAM
D: I would think so. Your name will be in all the papers, and not just Boston. Denison House stands to come in for funding, national attention.
C: AMELIA
D: Specially if I don't make it.
C: SAM
D: Don't joke about that. She wasn't joking at all.
C: SAM
D: You'll make it. And then you'll have opportunities to work in aviation. Anywhere you want. She laughs.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Well, I'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger. That's not exactly a career in aviation. She looks up at his eyes.
C: I AMELIA
D: 'm not going anywhere, social work is my life. After all the years of false starts, I found the thing I'm meant to do. Keep walking. She gives him time to say...
E: CONT'D
C: SAM
D: And where does that leave us?
C: AMELIA
D: You do love to look on the dark side. Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me? She gives him a sweet playful smile. It doesn't reassure him.
C: SAM
D: It's not as if I'd been putting pressure on you.
C: AMELIA
D: What love means to you. What it requires. Is the pressure. He stops walking.
C: SAM
D: I love you. Is that such a terrible problem? She gazes at him. Can he even hear this?
C: AMELIA
D: The problem is what it's always been. The problem is me.
S: INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL - DAY
N: MOVIETONE NEWSREEL footage, accompanied by their signature fanfare theme. Hotel conference room jammed with press. A sexy brunette in a sweater that seems to be made of strips of GOLD FOIL steps to a bank of microphones. Flashes start POPPING.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll, about to become the first female to fly the Atlantic in the wake of Lindbergh's historic journey, regales an eager world press... The sound switches to Mabel at the mikes...
E: O.S.
C: MABEL
D: Okay, boys. I'll take any questions you wanna throw my way. Except about what's behind this sweater. The boys ROAR. Mabel keeps her smile tight.
C: MABEL
D: The story. Behind it. Of course.
E: CONT'D
N: As the laughter CONTINUES... T
S: INT. HANGAR, EAST BOSTON AIRPORT - NIGHT
N: he heavy door rolls OPEN. George and Amelia enter the brightly-lit hangar to see two men working on the FRIENDSHIP, a sea-plane with golden wings. Its red-orange fuselage stands beside gigantic PONTOONS, each 29 feet long. The pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to the plane. They turn toward us now. BILL STULTZ is short and wiry with quick eyes. Only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures and the streaks of gray through his hair. He is not necessarily happy to see us.
C: AMELIA
D: George had told me Stultz was Adm. Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless, gifted. He drank. But George said it never affected his work. George waves as we approach. Bill and Amelia seem locked on each other.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: When he said it, I must have had a funny look. So I just said, `Yeh, I grew up around a guy like that.'
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
C: AMELIA
D: We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress.' Bill doesn't smile. The other man does...
C: GEORGE
D: Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator. She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way.
C: GEORGE
D: And Bill Stultz here, simply the most talented pilot working. She takes Bill's powerful hand. The look between them calm, yet somehow intense. As if each is establishing a tone for their relationship.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got his plane...
E: CONT'D
N: AMELIA ou mean the Admiral flies on those? The pontoons. She does not seem admiring.
C: GEORGE
D: Nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself. Bill nods on that. Sure were.
C: GEORGE
D: This way, if you're forced down at sea, you can wait for a rescue.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Hmmn. What does that do to our fuel?
C: BILL
D: Costs us at least 400 gallons. Don't bother bringing clothes for Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the nearest beach in Ireland. Real lucky.
C: GEORGE
D: The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles. But Amelia looks to Bill. That's not really possible is it?
C: BILL
D: The Admiral is the Admiral. He gets to estimate any damn thing he wants. All we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol. She turns to George with challenging eyes.
C: BILL
D: Don't go blaming the bookseller. He's been all through this with Mrs. Guest, but she worships the Admiral. And it's money that puts planes in the air.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try.
N: Bill's small smile. Maybe the girl's all right.
S: EXT. DOCK - LATER
N: George and Amelia approach a waiting motorboat, as the lights of Boston glimmer across the harbor. His head is down. She's watching his profile.
C: AMELIA
D: Sorry. I'll try keeping my mouth shut.
C: GEORGE
D: What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile.
N: e meant that. And she seems oddly touched.
C: AMELIA
D: Careful. I could get to like it. No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her decide. And then... She reaches to clasp his hand. Hops down beside him.
C: AMELIA
D: Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Simpkin.
E: a smile
C: AMELIA
D: It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching.
S: EXT. ROOF, COPLEY PLAZA HOTEL - DAY
N: Amelia in a flying outfit. Hands on her hips as if posing.
C: AMELIA
D: There's a Beatrix Potter story about a cat named Simpkin. PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: He wasn't happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup. So he could never become bored. We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is labeled `LUCKY LINDY.'
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: THe illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace. The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh in a different pose.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: What are you boys doing over there?
C: GEORGE
D: Trying to make you look like a girl. George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to Lindbergh's angle.
C: MELIA
D: I wondered. Was I Mr. Putnam's 43rd mouse? Or his 307th. Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face...
E: V.O.
C: EORGE
D: he more we can make you look like a girl, the better.
C: AMELIA
D: Oh god, is it worth the effort? He cocks his head, studies her. Nah, guess not.
C: GEORGE
D: Wondering who should play you in the film of all this. I'm thinking Chaplin.
C: AMELIA
D: Valentino's not available? He shakes his head sadly. Adjusts her collar once more. This time, his hands linger.
C: AMELIA
D: Two things. One, Chaplin can't play me because he's perfect for you. And two, you have company. She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is being helped onto the roof. George's face lights to see her. He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her tenderly. Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them both.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney Putnam. The women trade smiles. They shake hands, holding eye contact.
C: DOROTHY
D: Great to meet you. George talks so much about you. In fact, lately, you're all he does talk about.
E: a wink
N: George steps in close, and the photographer SNAPS a three- shot. And another.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Hold those smiles for one more, please.
S: EXT. JEFFREY YACHT CLUB HARBOR, EAST BOSTON - EARLY LIGHT 15
N: The FRIENDSHIP bobbing on its pontoons. Bill and Slim are off-loading equipment and other gear from the plane to a TUGBOAT filled with support crew and family. The plane's engines REV in the predawn stillness. PULL BACK to see...
S: EXT. YACHT CLUB DOCK - EARLY LIGHT
N: 6 16 ...the yacht club dock. George and Amelia alone at the railing. She's wearing her leather flight jacket and boots. They stare out at the plane, so frail and awkward. From her bag now, she pulls three ENVELOPES... Puts them in George's hand. Straight, unblinking...
C: AMELIA
D: Popping off letters. For my dad, my mom, my sis. You know. In case.
N: He stares down. Rocked by the weight of this against the simplicity of her words. The top envelope says: DEAREST DAD.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm honored. That you'd leave these with me.
C: AMELIA
D: Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault. Said in her sunny way. But she's not kidding. It takes a beat before he can offer...
C: GEORGE
D: I'll call them once you're safely on your way.
C: AMELIA
D: Sam will handle that. They trust him. That registers.
C: GEORGE
D: I've figured out the Simpkin thing, you know.
C: AMELIA
D: Have you.
C: GEORGE
D: Sure. There are so few books I haven't published, it was easy to find. Well...?
C: GEORGE
D: Beatrix Potter, the Tailor of Gloucester. He's a cat in a green frock coat.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: But why is he you? Oh.
C: GEORGE
D: He's brilliant, charismatic...
C: AMELIA
D: So you haven't actually read it. Do you actually read?
C: GEORGE
D: ...neurotic, compulsive, manipulative. Am I getting warmer? She sighs.
N: AMELIA ray I make it. Or the secret pops off with me. A held look. A friendly...
C: AMELIA
D: Well. See ya. She walks off down the dock toward the Friendship. e stands watching her go.
E: CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO...
S: INT. SMALL HOTEL, NEWFOUNDLAND - MORNING
N: Amelia alone, leaving her hotel room in her flight jacket. Locking the door. SUPERIMPOSE: FIRST STOP: CANADA
C: AMELIA
D: Our first hop was to Canada, to start from as close as we could get to Ireland. Just in case we couldn't get the thing in the air and had to row. She walks briskly down the corridor.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: The fuel was going to be so close, every single mile counted. Turns a corner. Approaches the dining room door.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: George told me to keep to my room, just in case there was a reporter or two somewhere. She enters the hotel dining room. Stops cold. Across the room a disgruntled Bill and a sheepish Slim stare at her from their breakfast, surrounded by 15 REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. Holy shit. Half a dozen CAMERAS RISE as one. It is a defining moment. And Amelia... Cocks her head. Throws an effortless golden smile.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: Hi there, boys. How are the ham and eggs? The FLASHES EXPLODE as one. They keep POPPING as Amelia makes her way to them.
C: BILL
D: Don't blame us, lady. I think somebody's starting to sell books. The reporters are handing her their morning editions. The New York Times front page headline: BOSTON GIRL STARTS FOR
C: ATLANTIC HOP.
D: There beneath the headline, the glamorous PHOTO we watched being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady Lindy. Next to it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker.
N: melia is sifting through the other papers, grinning and shaking her head.
C: EPORTER
D: Say, Amelia. What have you got for Mabel Boll to chew on?
C: AMELIA
D: Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me? I don't have a single sweater made out of gold. The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US!
C: AMELIA
D: Hey, not even silver. The boys make room. Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair. A friendly murmur...
E: CONT'D
C: BILL
D: The ham's a little tough, Commander. But the bacon's swell.
S: INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - DAY
N: MOVIETONE NEWSREEL footage, accompanied by their signature fanfare theme. Once more, the hotel conference room jammed with press. Today Mabel wears a luxurious silver fox coat, shimmies up to a bank of microphones at the podium. Flashes start POPPING.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll, upstaged by upstart social worker, seems madder than a rich wet hen. Hey Mabel, tell us about your rival! The sound switches to Mabel leaning her sultry voice to the mikes...
E: O.S.
C: MABEL
D: Well, how would any woman feel about some tart who steals her man? Reporters furiously writing, more flashes EXPLODE.
C: MABEL
D: Bill Stultz and I were going to make history together, until this poor little social worker and her sugar daddy, oh excuse me, `publisher,' started throwing money and I don't know what else at him.
E: CONT'D
C: EPORTER
D: Mabel, are you implying Miss Earhart used her feminine charms on your pilot?
C: MABEL
D: I don't know, Charlie, I never seen her. Has she got any? LAUGHTER, they're all calling out. She shows them a smoky smile, but stays on message.
C: MABEL
D: Well, she had to use something on somebody to get from nowhere to here. You figure it out, or wait til George Putnam feeds it to you. Two dozen questions at once. She's not even listening.
E: CONT'D
C: MABEL
D: We're going to Canada, waiting for some good weather on the Atlantic, and then we'll kick Little Miss Whoozis in the keester.
E: CONT'D
C: REPORTER
D: What makes you so cocky that she won't leave first?
C: MABEL
D: Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to go to China. That thing they're flying can't load enough gas to make Yonkers. Tell that to Putnam's girlie. And while you're at it... She snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her.

E: O.S.
N: ERIES OF ANGLES. One failed take-off after another.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Perhaps it's for the best. Remember, no woman has beat the jinx of the Atlantic and three have died trying. Including a princess and the niece of former President Woodrow Wilson. The plane's engine SPUTTERS and STALLS. It floats on the sea.
E: O.S. CONT'D

We CLOSE on a clear-eyed tomboy with war paint and tousled hair, AMELIA at seven, looking up excitedly as a car pulls to the curb. er FATHER climbs slowly from the car, WOBBLES his way across the lawn. The kids part to let him through, the confusion and disappointment on every face. He ignores them all, even Amelia. The front door opens... ...Amelia's MOTHER gazes at him with shame and disdain. As she helps him stagger inside...
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING
N: Amelia in her flight gear, sitting on the edge of her bed, an open TELEGRAM lies beside her. Her elbows rest on her knees. Her hands are locked together. Her profile is stony, determined. TILT DOWN to the telegram... It reads: WEATHER PERMITTING, MABEL FLIES THIS AFTERNOON. She grabs her flight bag, leaves the room. She only has to travel as far as the next door. POUNDS on it. Waits. Pounds LOUDER with both fists. Slim opens the door. Looking bad. Bill sits up in bed, groggy, disoriented.
C: BILL
D: Christ, what time is...
C: AMELIA
D: Time to fly. Get up, get dressed, we're going now. She is calm and angry at once. A powerful combination. Slim pulls his pants off a chair.

C: BILL
D: It's not good enough.
E: CONT'D

D: It's fine, there's a tail wind all the way, we'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to Ireland.
C: BILL
D: We've had better than this and we haven't gone.

C: BILL
D: You're serious.
C: AMELIA
D: Just as serious as you're hung over. You go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane. Go. Now! Slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his bag. Looks to Bill, but the pilot is glaring at his commander.
E: to Slim
N: AMELIA (CONT'D) (QUIET) Slim, get out. I've got this. A beat. Slim goes, the door shuts quietly. Amelia sits on the edge of Bill's bed.

C: AMELIA
D: Good. Slim, start the engines. She still hasn't given the paper to Bill. Slim steps onto a pontoon. Starts CRANKING up the propellers. As the engine KICKS to life...
N: She hands the weather report to Bill. He reads. Looks to her eyes.
C: AMELIA
D: You signed a contract. You've got a direct instruction from me to go. That report indicates some degree of risk and it's a risk I'm taking.
E: CONT'D
C: BILL
D: Have a nice flight.
C: AMELIA
D: Thanks. She motions to Slim, get on board. The navigator grins, starts to climb up, looking back at Bill...
C: SLIM
D: Hey, I'm scared shitless of this dame. She climbs up after him. One look back...
C: AMELIA
D: Read tomorrow's papers, Bill. We'll both be in them. And disappears. Alone on the dock, Bill hears the engines REV. Jesus, God, she's going to do it. He takes a step toward the plane, but her head appears in the hatch...

E: CONT'D

N: WITH Amelia as she locks the hatch. For the first time, we can see the inside of the plane. The cabin is too small for anyone to stand. The plane has been emptied of everything but two huge elliptical FUEL TANKS. he wedges herself between the gigantic tanks. Bill pulls the throttle and the Fokker Tri-motor LURCHES forward, STRAINING against the surface of the sea in a rattling, throbbing desperately VIBRATING all-out attempt. Amelia crawls to the tiny window, her face to the glass as chop and spray FLY PAST like shrapnel, and the engines WHINE and PULSE louder... ...twenty seconds, thirty. Still on the surface. Forty seconds, fifty, her eyes shut, her forehead bangs against the glass, come on, sixty seconds, and at 67...

As she braces herself against the hull... ...water DRIPS onto her from a loose seam. Could this be dangerous? She looks around. Through the opening between the elliptical fuel tanks... ...Bill and Slim at the controls. Bill is banging on something beside the instrument panel. Beneath his seat, she sees the TOOLBOX. The water drips on her faster. She crawls forward toward the boys, arriving to see... ...Bill POUNDING what we can now see is his RADIO. His face is red, angry. She watches for a beat. AMELIA YOU OKAY? BILL BE BETTER IF OUR DAMN RADIO WOULD
C: JOIN THE PARTY!
D: He never turns to her, but she studies him. Is he impaired or simply frustrated? She slips the toolbox from beneath his seat and crawls back to the leak. But as she opens the box... ...there, among the wrench and pliers, a BOTTLE of whiskey. She stares at it as we SNAP TO...

S: INT. FRIENDSHIP
N: BACK to Amelia with Bill's bottle, as the battered plane lurches every which way in the storm. She lifts it from the toolbox. Hides it in the camera bag, as suddenly the plane DROPS fifty feet, and Amelia is SLAMMED against the ceiling, then crashes back to the floor. Dazed, she sees Bill turned around... BILL HOLD ONTO SOMETHING FOR CHRISSAKE! She GRABS the leg of the navigation table which has been bolted down. Stares out the window, wondering if she'll make it.
C: AMELIA
D: Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last grand adventure. I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. You know that. I have no faith we'll meet anywhere again, but I wish we might. HOLD on the gray eyes. DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia at the window, still opaque with fog. Suddenly, the plane SWOOPS down toward a clearing in the clouds.

C: NOT ON THIS OCCASION.
D: A rare smile...
N: BILL
C: WELL, THEN.
D: And SWOOPS back on course. Amelia's hand squeezes his shoulder. DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia crouched behind Bill's seat. Fog starting to break up.
N: Her face drawn, she almost seems to be holding her breath. Something down below. As we drop, we hear the engines SPUTTER. MELIA WHEN'S THAT HOUR OF FUEL RUN OUT? BILL
C: EIGHTEEN MINUTES AGO. WHY?
D: She glances over to Slim, who is busy unwrapping a sandwich. She can't believe this. He takes a healthy bite.
N: AMELIA THE LONGER I OBSERVE MEN THE MORE I AM AWESTRUCK. BY THEIR CAPACITY

Amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the Friendship in distance. She is being rowed to shore. Our VIEW is over the back of the man rowing. Amelia is staring past him, vaguely apprehensive. REVERSE ANGLE. She's looking at TWO THOUSAND WELSHMEN swarming the docks. You can't even see the sand. The crowd is silent and staring. No cheers. As if they were staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. Bill and Slim help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. But when Amelia jumps out, the crowd...
N: ..begins to soberly APPLAUD, and slowly CLOSES IN around her. At first she seems pleased, trying to shake every hand thrust toward her. She doesn't see that Bill and Slim have been shunted to the back. Suddenly... ...people get BOLDER. CLAPPING her on the back, reaching to TOUCH her, someone SNATCHES her scarf, she looks around frantically for Bill and Slim as... ...a SHERIFF and three DEPUTIES muscle their way to her using billy clubs to push people back.

C: AMELIA
D: This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man. Such calm self-possession. Such confidence in that.

D: It's not so much that my husband is having an affair with his meal ticket. It's just a pity we can't have one honest conversation about it.
C: GEORGE
D: What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department. She finishes her drink. Throws the glass away. From our ANGLE we can now see D Amelia in the window, watching them.
C: OROTHY
D: If this is what you call an honest talk, I'd say you need some practice.
C: GEORGE
D: Great. Let's try one about you and Fred Upton. She stops walking. Turns in shock, to see his easy smile.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I'm waiting for our practice conversation. Hoping I'll learn something. About honesty.
E: CONT'D
N: She GLARES at him, and storms off. He lets her go. Hear a car engine TURN OVER. Dorothy PEELING OUT. George reflects. As he walks back toward the party, he now sees Amelia in the window. He stops. Their look holds.
S: INT. KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT
N: George at the kitchen table in dim light. It's very late. A HAND places a steaming mug of coffee before him. Followed by a slice of pie. A fork. He smiles. And softly...
C: GEORGE
D: Dorothy and I are through. She sits beside him. Very close.
C: AMELIA
D: For a long, long time.
C: GEORGE
D: It's different now. She looks at him. Squints. How?
C: GEORGE
D: Marry me. Oh. A breath.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I can't do that.
C: GEORGE
D: If you give it a chance, you'll learn to love me. He seems so sunny and strong. What can he be feeling?
C: AMELIA
D: I already love you. That's why I can't marry you. GEORGE Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse.
E: a murmur
N: he comes close enough to kiss.
C: AMELIA
D: I know me. And you don't. Not really.
C: GEORGE
D: What if I promise not to learn?
C: AMELIA
D: The day will come. When I will run away. And when it does... He stops her with a kiss.
C: GEORGE
D: If you love me. I'll take my chances. He stares in her troubled eyes. There is no answer.
C: GEORGE
D: Race you to bed.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY - NEWSREEL
N: Amelia and nearly 20 WOMEN lined up in front of planes. Waving, smiling, talking to each other.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Amelia Earhart and a bevy of lovely competitors say hello to the press announcing the First Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland. Dubbed by Will Rogers `the Powder Puff Derby,' these gals certainly know how to capture our attention. The next ANGLE shows Amelia watching some of her colleagues bouncing playfully on a see-saw. She smiles tolerantly, but maybe there's a little too much cheesecake for her taste.
E: O.S.
S: INT. RECEPTION AREA, PUTNAM'S - DAY
N: The crowded waiting room. We CLOSE on a young woman we scarcely recognize. It is Elinor. Though less than a year has passed, she seems much older. Sophisticated, poised. ANGLE. A secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to George's office. As they enter, George is pacing on the phone. G EORGE (into phone) Because Amelia invented the Powder Puff Derby for female pilots. Then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator, and start from east of the Rockies so they won't crash into the mountains! Listens, impatient. GEORGE (into phone) I'll tell you why it's a front page story. Because Amelia pulled every woman out of the race. So the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts. You want me to write your headline? He glances over. Elinor in the doorway. GEORGE (into phone) Call you back. I've got a very important guest. He hangs up, gesturing graciously for her to sit. As she does...
C: ELINOR
D: Wish I was important enough for you to manage.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, I've just got one client. And most days she's more than I can manage. Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety.
C: ELINOR
D: Get in line behind the boys she smacked around on the Derby. He grins back. You bet.
C: ELINOR
D: Some of the gal flyers had their doubts about her...well, her skill level. But she's everyone's champion now.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: And both of those things. Are the S reasons I called you. trange words. He has her attention.
C: GEORGE
D: I think it would be huge for women flyers if Amelia won the Derby. The publicity would put the race, and all of you, up there with the boys.
E: CONT'D
C: ELINOR
D: I'm not sure she has much of a chance, Mr. Putnam.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. We're thinking the Lockheed Vega. The girl's shock. He really means this.
C: ELINOR
D: Sir, I've test piloted the Vega. It's way more than she could ever handle. It wouldn't be safe, let alone successful. He smiles.
C: GEORGE
D: That's why I'm thinking of you flying with her. You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75 a week. Elinor WHISTLES low.
C: ELINOR
D: Well, I think that's the most generous opportunity I've ever been offered. He stares at her.
C: GEORGE
D: There's just one thing. Obviously, it has to appear that Amelia did all the flying. So when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one side. Her eyes narrow. He's completely serious.
C: ELINOR
D: In that case, I'll get my own plane and win the race myself.
C: GEORGE
D: You haven't changed.
N: o smile at all.
C: GEORGE
D: Unfortunately for you, neither have I. The look in his eye is not to be ignored.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: You can't win if you can't get a plane to enter. Let me predict that you won't. The voice calm and low and riveting.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: In fact. If you reject my generosity, you may come to regret it. For a long, long time.
E: CONT'D
C: ELINOR
D: That's a threat.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor. And this is what my loyalty requires. She's glaring. Reeling. Trapped.
C: ELINOR
D: She's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
C: GEORGE
D: She probably meant me. So honest, the words confuse her.
C: ELINOR
D: Obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, sure she does. A straight smile...
C: GEORGE
D: She just doesn't care. ...which silently fades.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: My job. Is to care for her.
E: CONT'D

S: INT. OAK ROOM, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT
N: LONG ANGLE. Sophisticated watering hole. Crowded tonight. PAN to find George alone, waiting. A waiter leads Amelia to the table. George stands, smiling. But the smile is not returned. We CLOSE as they sit... GEORGE hat's wrong? MELIA (clearly furious) What could be wrong? I had such a lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith. Oh.
C: GEORGE
D: he told you that I shut her out of the Derby. And that's true.
C: AMELIA
D: And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this.
E: calm, straight
C: AMELIA
D: What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work?
C: GEORGE
D: I didn't say that.
C: AMELIA
D: Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but...
C: GEORGE
D: ou're making your life hap...
C: AMELIA
D: But this is different. It is.
C: AMELIA
D: If women are going to stab women in the back, then women are going nowhere.
E: CONT'D
N: Are you listening?
C: GEORGE
D: rom here on, I'll just stab men in he back. A
C: MELIA
D: You didn't do this for business, anyway. G
C: EORGE
D: I did it for fun?
C: AMELIA
D: You did it because you love me. That stops him.
C: AMELIA
D: And when we're married, you mustn't ever... Now she stops. Because his eyes are wide.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: What's the big shock? I thought you wanted to get married. Full beat.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: did. I do.
C: AMELIA
D: Well, then. His eyes moving over her face.
C: GEORGE
D: What about what you said? The day S will come when you run away. he nods. It will.
C: AMELIA
D: You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it. And yet.
C: AMELIA
D: Sometimes things happen that way. You're not better safe than sorry. Tears stand in his eyes. He is so happy.
E: CONT'D
N: AMELIA (a whisper) (CONT'D) Yes? GEORGE (a whisper) Hell yes.
S: INT. GEORGE'S MOTHER'S HOME, NOANK, CONNECTICUT - DAY
N: Through a window, a dry, wintered garden. Snow falling, at once soft and heavy. Beyond, Morgan Point Lighthouse, Fisher's Island Sound, Long Island Sound. One lonely fishing boat braves the cold water. PULL BACK to see... ...Amelia at the breakfast table in a windowed room. She is writing, and as she does...
T: UPERIMPOSE: WEDDING DAY. CONNECTICUT, 1931.
N: ...her eyes are swimming with tears. She brushes at them. Stares down at her work. Continues. ANGLE. The parlor. George, his MOTHER, the MINISTER, a small number of close FRIENDS. From the doorway, Amelia beckons George. The letter is in her hand.
S: EXT. HOME - MOMENTS LATER
N: Amelia holds tight to George's hand, leading him out into the falling snow. She turns, fixes him with a look. Hands him the letter. And steps back. As if giving him space. At first, he smiles. What is this? She gestures for him to read. As he begins, there is nothing for a few seconds. Then...
C: AMELIA
D: ...I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me. Nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly. Snow falling. Absolute silence.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: If we can be honest I think the difficulties which may arise may best be avoided should you or I become interested deeply, or in passing, with anyone else. She gazes intently, her heart in her eyes. He never looks up.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Please let us not interfere with the other's work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements. And then...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) must exact a cruel promise. And that is you will let me go in a year if we find no happiness together. He stops on this. His thoughts unreadable.
C: AMELIA
D: I will try to do my best in every way. And give you that part of me you know and seem to want. He folds the letter carefully. Places it in his pocket. And smiles.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: y Amelia. Brutal in her frank- ness. Beautiful in her honesty. He steps to her. Looks in her eyes. They kiss.
S: INT. PARLOR - LATER
N: LONG ANGLE. The minister reading the vows. The witnesses standing silent. Two black cats rubbing against George's ankles.
T: DISSOLVE TO...
S: INT. KITCHEN, RYE - MORNING
N: George at the breakfast table. His eggs and toast ignored for the moment, he's reading a magazine article. PAN to Amelia, sipping her coffee. Watching him. GEORGE (reads aloud) `Why I Believe Women Pilots Can't Fly The Atlantic. An outspoken warning by Lady Heath.' (READING) `...pure suicide for any woman today...it is madness for them to attempt it and...' He looks up to her.
C: GEORGE
D: `...at least the first dozen will be drowned.' And we're reading
E: CONT'D
N: this, because...?
C: MELIA
D: I might fly to Paris. Silence.
C: GEORGE
D: Which is actually across the Atlantic.
C: AMELIA
D: Hence, the article. Ah. He nods.
C: AMELIA
D: I'm thinking of doing it solo.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Would you mind? He butters his toast.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Not at all. When would you like to go?
S: EXT. GARDEN, RYE - DAY
N: CLOSE on Amelia as she kneels, carefully putting new plants into the ground. We see patience, concentration. Contentment. After a moment...
C: AMELIA
D: I'm surprised you're all right with this... WIDEN ANGLE. George kneeling beside her. Happily planting his own.
C: GEORGE
D: Really.
C: AMELIA
D: Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the lecture. Five years since Lindbergh, no one's made it solo, so many of them died. He looks at her work. Reaches over. Starts packing the earth HARDER around her plant. She just watches, then...
C: GEORGE
D: ell, they were only men. This is different. She reaches to his plant and starts LOOSENING the soil...
C: AMELIA
D: I was waiting to hear that I'm only doing this because I was just a passenger last time, and I'd rather die than go on living as a fraud.. No one cracks a smile. It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food fight where each lets the other take his best shot. George
N: reaches now, starts REPACKING her soil...
C: MELIA
D: But you don't think that, do you, ear?
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Of course not. But if I did... She SMACKS his hand. He just keeps working. She finally grins, smacks him HARDER. He doesn't seem to notice.
C: GEORGE
D: ...all the more reason to say yes.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT - DUSK
N: AERIAL ANGLE. In the sun's last light, two figures walk slowly, far below us. The Vega waits. CLOSE ANGLE. They stand beneath the wing. Her ground crew in far distance, giving them their moment. Her look is not breezy and cavalier this time, but tender and intimate. She knows the fear beneath his easy smile. He produces a RING, a band of black fibers.
C: GEORGE
D: Elephant hair, I think you wear it on your toe. It's good luck. He puts it in her hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Anyway. That's what the elephant told me. Amelia looks at the ring. Turns it in her fingers.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I think luck has rules. And I try to respect them. My favorite is... She glances up.
C: AMELIA
D: We make our own luck, you and I. Remember that. He will remember that. And more.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Do you have money?
C: AMELIA
D: No. He pulls out a twenty dollar bill. Hands it to her.
C: AMELIA
D: All this? G
E: CONT'D
C: EORGE
D: Sure.
C: AMELIA
D: Thank god, I thought you were going to tear it in half.
C: GEORGE
D: I spent our money on ocean liner passage to go bring you back. It's non-refundable. So try to do your part. She nods. She'll try. He doesn't want to leave her yet.
C: GEORGE
D: So the Simpkin thing. What was all that?
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? He shakes his head. GEORGE Either way, something to look forward to. She puts her hands on his face. She doesn't want to leave him either.
E: very soft
N: AMELIA (murmurs) Stake up the peonies, huh? They're messy when they bloom on the ground, and... And. AMELIA (a whisper) I want to see their heads high. When I come home. She leans up to kiss him. And again. Feeling in her eyes that he will never forget.
C: AMELIA
D: See ya.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. VEGA - NIGHT
N: Amelia alone. Starry night. 12,000 feet below are ICEBERGS. A single fishing boat.
C: AMELIA
D: The weather report wasn't perfect. But we knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldn't. Ahead, towering CLOUDS in moonlight. Too high to fly over.
E: V.O.
C: AMELIA
D: I closed the deal by choosing May 20, five years to the day from Lindbergh's flight. It was too good a sell for George to resist. 5 What we didn't know...
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: EXT. VEGA - LATER
N: 2 52 A terrifying STORM BATTERS the plane, which bobs and darts and dips like a leaf in a gale.
C: AMELIA

E: V.O.
S: INT. VEGA - SAME MOMENT
N: Amelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN.
C: AMELIA
D: The only way to have any sense of altitude, was to keep dropping toward the sea.
E: V.O.
N: (MORE) AMELIA(cont'd) When the engines sputtered, that was my low-level limit. A sudden JOLT knocks her OUT of her seat. She scrambles back, as we see WHITECAPS A FEW FEET BELOW. She JERKS the nose UP, the engine COUGHS... ...and CLIMBS.
C: AMELIA
D: I was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become. The joke was... LATER. Flying in and out of cloud cover.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: All those months flying only with instruments, I should have been practicing without them. PAN to the windshield. A small GLOW at the surface of a vibrating engine. Amelia hasn't noticed.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I started to wonder if luck was paying me back. For thinking I knew the rules. A small BLUE FLAME LICKS out into the night.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Then I smelled burning oil. She sees it now. The flame coming through a broken weld in the manifold ring. A
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: MELIA
D: A bad weld, already a small flame. It would be hours back to Canada, trying to find an unlit field, landing with a heavy fuel load. She stares at the little flame. Is it growing bigger?
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I told myself, push on. After all, if it was a stupid choice... LATER. Flying in blackness. Rising, as the engines seem sluggish.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: ...no one would ever know. Suddenly, a FILM of SLUSH on the windscreen.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: With seemingly no warning, there was ice. The controls froze. And the Vega DIVES into a DIZZYING SPIN.
E: V.O. CONT'D

N: HOURS LATER. Amelia seriously fatigued. She breaks through cloud into DAZZLING SUNLIGHT, and blinks, blinded.
C: AMELIA
D: I'd read that part in George's reception room that first day. Bless him for keeping me waiting. The FUEL GAUGE reads EMPTY. She switches on the RESERVE TANK. And as she DROPS back down into opaque clouds... ...she feels something. Her fingertips go to her left shoulder, and come away... Wet. Slick.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: The cockpit gauge was defective. There was a steady trickle of fuel down my neck. She looks around helplessly for a way to stem the dripping.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: Toss-up whether the bigger danger was running out of gas or going up in a fireball. I had my answer in less than an hour, when...
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO...
N: LATER. Amelia beyond exhaustion. Staring fixedly at some- thing we can't see. Until we PAN through the wind screen to the leak in the manifold weld. The BLUE FLAME is startlingly LARGER, now LICKING its way along the surface of the fuselage...
C: AMELIA
D: The manifold weld began to separate. I gauged the likelihood of explosion at somewhere between probable and inevitable.

E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: What on earth would you need me for? She's making a real mess of the lobster. Gene notices. PAUL COLLINS doesn't...
C: PAUL
D: Hasn't George taught you anything? Lady Lindy, the queen of the air, the best known woman in the entire U.S. of A? Gene reaches over, as if it were his own plate, and begins cracking her lobster for her. She looks in his eyes and tries to concentrate.
C: PAUL
D: Gene on the poster with you. Legendary athlete at West Point, two events in the Olympics, a top pilot who should be running the skies for Roosevelt when he wins...

E: V.O. CONT'D

D: Oh, fine. Really? He smiles, gently.

C: ENE
D: Listen, Paul and I would be thrilled to rope you into our shuttle.
E: CONT'D

C: GENE
D: The next adventure. What is it? She shrugs. No idea.
C: GENE
D: Because we're running out of oceans.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA

C: GENE
D: Is to keep feeding the beast. She can't smile anymore. Because this is the very fear she lives with.
E: CONT'D

C: MELIA

N: They share a look of such mutual understanding, neither has to smile.
C: AMELIA
D: The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
C: ELEANOR
D: And it will take at least four years to correct the mistake. Keeps eating.
C: ELEANOR
D: I did ask about aviation, but he hasn't decided on the structure yet. It might be under the Bureau f Commerce.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it. Said casually, looking at her plate.
C: ELEANOR
D: My hearing is failing. I missed the words `or woman,' which you undoubtedly added after, or per- haps before, the word `man.'
C: AMELIA
D: his could be one of those rare instances. When the most accomplished candidate. Turns out to be male. Glances up for the reaction.

Eleanor looks over. Are you serious?
C: AMELIA
D: It's dual controls. No one will ever know. Hesitation.
C: AMELIA
D: Don't you trust me? And slowly, Eleanor's fingers close on her wheel. Amelia's hands come away from hers.
E: CONT'D
C: ELEANOR
D: Dear God. The Condor purrs along through the night air. The moon bobs slightly off to one side. Eleanor's eyes are swimming with the thrill of this.

George watching it all from the doorway. His easy smile seems comfortably in place, as... ...Amelia walks Gene up the path, her arm around his waist, talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl.

C: GEORGE
D: I've talked to the promoters, they'll switch some lecture dates for us. Now he's looking at her profile. Saddened, if not surprised, by what he sees.
C: AMELIA
D: Well, it's not just that. There's y work on the shuttle, we're at a critical stage, and...I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch... She knows he's watching. Shakes her head. Keeps on working.
C: GEORGE
D: Normally, I'd be worried about leaving you here alone. But I suppose that won't be a problem, will it? She stops now. Looks up at him. If he wants a direct conversation, he can have it.
C: AMELIA
D: What are you trying to say?
C: GEORGE
D: I think I've just said it. A long held look. Neither backing away. Sadness on both sides. GEORGE Is there anything you want to say? She sighs. Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with affection.
E: softly

D: If you don't drink, why do you come o bars?
C: AMELIA
D: Must be the ambience. And the nuts.

D: Any guy would have to be nuts to do that. I'm considerable trouble, if you haven't noticed.
C: GENE
D: You keep advertising that, but I'm still waiting to see it. She looks down at her fingers as they shell. Barely audible...

D: Well, there's Magellan, 400 years go. Actually, he didn't make it. And he died. And he used a boat.
C: GORE
D: So it's almost the same, except it's completely different.
C: AMELIA
D: Pretty much. He glowers at her. She glowers back.
C: GENE
D: There are men who say they flew around the world, but they didn't ly around all of it.
C: GORE
D: Because at higher latitudes, it's short trip. At the North Pole, ou just spin in a circle and you've gone around the world.
C: AMELIA
D: So why are you asking? Just to show how smart you are?
C: GORE
D: Pretty much.
N: Now he's grinning. She just glowers harder.
C: ORE
D: The only way to really fly around he world is to fly the entire circumference of 27,000 miles. Like at the equator.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: No one's tried it. You think I should? No answer.
C: AMELIA
D: Dare me.
E: CONT'D
C: GORE
D: Okay.
C: AMELIA
D: Okay. Is she serious? She seems to be.
C: GENE
D: Ask her about the Pacific. The maximum range of the Electra is 4000 miles. And the closest land est of Honolulu is farther than that. Gore looks to her. Well?
C: AMELIA
D: I'll have to refuel.
C: GORE
D: Where?
C: AMELIA
D: In the air. One plane to another. The boy is staring at her now. Staring.
C: GORE
D: You're really going to do all this, aren't you?
C: AMELIA
D: Well, don't you think I can? A beat.
C: GORE
D: I guess we'll find out.
N: Another.
C: AMELIA
D: Pretty much. HOLD on Gene. He smiles at his kid...
C: GENE
D: Go out to the car and get Sara. Ask if she'll take you for an ice cream. Okay? The boy knows he's being dismissed. Looks from his dad to Amelia, who steps forward to give him a hug and a kiss.
C: AMELIA
D: We'll play some cards before you leave. Okay, then. He waves. One more glance at dad, and Gore goes. Gene gestures for Amelia to come with him, away from the mechanics. What's up? But he's already walking to... ...a little folding table, off in a corner. She follows. Sits. Well...? G
C: ENE
D: You can't refuel in the air. Just like that.
C: AMELIA
D: s that an opinion or an order? His rueful smile.
C: GENE
D: The only good thing about losing our former relationship is I feel a little freer to tell you when you're being completely crazy.
C: AMELIA
D: Oh, I bet there are more advantages than just that. No one's backing down on this.
C: GENE
D: You're not a good enough pilot to o mid-air refueling. You will not be able to control the Electra or that docking maneuver for that amount of time.
C: AMELIA
D: I've taken bigger risks.
C: GENE
D: I've noticed. Don't be so proud of it. He reaches into a pocket. Pulls out a folded sheet of paper. It opens to reveal a MAP of the Pacific. A dot is CIRCLED in red.
C: GENE
D: This is Howland Island. It's half- way between Honolulu and New Guinea. It has no elevation, no trees, it's a mile wide and a mile and a half long. Hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: It's your vacation home.
C: GENE
D: We're colonizing it, because when the Japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there. She blinks. The Japanese.
C: GENE
D: Try reading the newspapers between he lines. We haven't started building the runways yet. Maybe if someone I knew could get the President's attention... She stares at the map. The dot.
E: CONT'D
C: GENE
D: It's really tiny, a grain of sand n the middle of a thousand miles f nowhere. Her eyes are clicking through a calculus of their own.
E: CONT'D
N: GENE (CONT'D) You'd need a first-class navigator or that leg. Which means the trip can't be entirely solo. And softly...
C: GENE
D: Can you handle that?
E: CONT'D
N: No answer. He waits without saying a word. AMELIA (softly back) Don't rush me. I'm thinking.
S: EXT. COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - MORNING
N: A Coast Guard station overlooking the Pacific. A lone woman leans on a railing. From the station, a MAN emerges, he has... ...a thermos and two large mugs. He pours steaming coffee into each, and brings them to the woman at the rail. She has turned to study him as he approaches.
C: AMELIA
D: Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet you. She holds out her hand. He juggles the mugs, so he can shake it. Strong look in each other's eyes. Hands her a mug...
C: FRED
D: I hear you like your coffee black.
C: AMELIA
D: This time of day, I like it with bacon and eggs. His slight grin. A handsome guy.
C: FRED
D: Be right back.
C: AMELIA
D: Over easy on the eggs. Your job could depend on it. Silence between them. Comfortable smiles.
C: FRED
D: Are we sizing me up? And, of course, this is exactly what she's doing.
C: AMELIA
D: I'm told that mid-air refueling would be beyond my abilities.
C: FRED
D: Maybe, maybe not. 20% it works. 0% you crash. 60% you don't get he fuel, so you're cooked anyway.
C: AMELIA
D: Better odds of hitting that island?
C: RED
D: How do you feel about 100%? Watching his eyes as he says that. Evaluating.
C: AMELIA
D: Even with cloud cover?
C: FRED
D: I've crossed the Pacific by air 18 times. Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
C: AMELIA
D: They did.
C: FRED
D: Someone else told you I have a drinking problem. Which is a big art of why we're here, yes? No answer.
C: FRED
D: Pan Am will tell you. Everyone I ver worked for will tell you. Nothing's interfered with my performance. Not once.
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his soul.
C: FRED
D: You trusted Bill Stultz. That worked out. Rest his soul.
C: AMELIA
D: Bill just had to find Europe. We're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet. He shakes his head.
C: FRED
D: That's what you're looking for. I'm looking for coordinates on a map. And if it doesn't work... He spreads his large hands...
C: FRED
D: Money-back guarantee. She holds the look. AMELIA Hey. How can I lose?
E: CONT'D softly
S: INT. BARCLAY HOTEL, NEW YORK - DAY

C: AMELIA
D: The airstrip has been planned for a long time. I was thrilled to learn it will be ready in time for my flight. The navy has been wonderful, as always.

N: REPORTER #1 Amelia, what do you say to the charges that your husband is pulling the strings, pressuring you nto this around-the-world flight o make a financial killing? George BOLTS forward to the microphones, looks at his wife with astonishment...
C: GEORGE
D: Wait a minute, you're flying around the world? Don't you know a woman's place is in the home?? The press ROARS with laughter.
N: REPORTER #2 George, why don't you go along this time? Watch over the little woman.
C: GEORGE
D: I begged to go. But it seems that between 185 pounds of husband and
N: 85 pounds of fuel, I lost out. Gazes at his wife.
C: GEORGE
D: At least, I think that's what all he laughter meant. He gives her a kiss. Thirty FLASHES record it. As he steps back...
E: CONT'D
N: REPORTER #3 Experts are saying that this `flying laboratory' is a sham. There's nothing to be learned for aviation, and you're just in this for the money. The place gets really quiet.
C: AMELIA
D: Who am I to argue with `experts?' I'll just give you my plain old common-sense thinking on this... Pens come up, cameras jockey for position. This is what they're waiting for. She holds up one finger. First...
C: AMELIA
D: We may not learn much about the plane, but we will about the pilot. Endurance over a month's journey, flying nearly every day. Response o stress, crises. I think that will make a contribution. Holds up a second finger. Two...
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I'm a working stiff like all of you. I don't apologize for the fact that I need money to live. And to keep financing my flying, which is what I love. I think that's a positive example for women. Third finger. Three...
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I'm not doing this as a scientist. I'm a flyer, boys, pursuing my passion. For the fun of it. The fun of it. Something I recommend as a healthy motive for women. A wink. A shrug...

C: FRED
D: Lovely. We've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground. Much safer than flying.

The right MOTOR is pushed up INTO its wing, which itself has BUCKLED, the stabilizer BENT, the left wing extends UPWARD from scraping the runway, the landing gear no longer exists.

N: hat... He stops. Realizing where he was going. She never looks up.
C: AMELIA
D: ...the best that money can buy. I just can't believe I've done this o us. All the money wasted that's never coming back.
C: GEORGE
D: You cut the engines. It would have cost a bundle more to replace a burned-up plane. Not to mention pilot. She shakes her head. No.
C: AMELIA
D: I overreacted. The plane was too heavy, I should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle. Tears stand in her eyes. She is so ashamed and remorseful. He lets it stay silent as they walk. Then...
C: GEORGE
D: t's only money, we'll figure it out. We always do.
C: AMELIA
D: I'll make it back and more, I promise. The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years.

D: Maybe. Or...
C: AMELIA
D: No, it will. Our prices, our sales, are going to double.
N: (MORE) AMELIA(cont'd) This showed them how dangerous it all is, they were taking it for granted... (SNIFFLES) They thought I was competent. GEORGE (softly) I meant. Or maybe we can quit. She looks over. Not sure if...

D: You mean after.
C: GEORGE
D: Or. Even now. A strong smile. He nods. We could.
C: AMELIA

Stands by the folding table we've seen before.

C: GENE
D: I guess I'm already outvoted.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: She'd outvote you all by herself. he does it to me every day. Gene's smile can't mask the concern in his eyes.
C: AMELIA
D: I don't have a choice. I have to reverse my route and fly east. If go west now, I'm risking hurricanes in the Caribbean and monsoons in Africa...
C: GENE
D: But you're flying Howland last, when you're exhausted. She knows this. In the silence...
C: EORGE
D: Gene, this way our first leg is Oakland to Miami. It's a shakedown o make sure the plane is right. That's crucial. Gene nods, slowly. His eyes still locked on her.
C: GENE
D: Maybe I'm obsessing on Howland because it was my bright idea, and I'd feel responsible if...
C: AMELIA
D: Well, if I do pop off, I'll try to make it somewhere that's not your fault.
C: GENE
D: I'd appreciate that. Draws a breath.
C: GENE
D: You miss that island. You'll be out of fuel, with 2000 miles to go.

N: ...Amelia's FACE, as we left it in the first scene. The STORM PELTING all around the open-sided bar. Fred studying her across the table.
C: FRED
D: A touching love story, really. He's been drinking, we can hear it in his voice. SEE the bottle now. Nearly gone.
C: AMELIA
D: An honest one. It's what you wanted. He nods. That's right.
C: FRED
D: I wonder if it's honest enough for George. If it's what he wanted. ou know.
C: AMELIA
D: If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore. In that way. Not for a long time.
C: FRED
D: Whose choice was that? She doesn't like his tone. Shifts in her seat.
C: AMELIA
D: It was mine.
C: FRED
D: Well, isn't it always? You choose in, you choose out. Makes things easy.
C: AMELIA
D: Anything but easy. Are you disapproving of the way I live?
C: FRED
D: Hell, no. It's just like me. In fact, it's like most guys I know. His smile.
C: FRED
D: Actually, I'd like a piece of it myself. Right about now. Her eyes harden. A
E: CONT'D
C: MELIA
D: If you have a point, Fred. Make it.
C: FRED
D: Oh, I believe I have. She rises slowly. Zips her flight jacket. Takes her slicker from the back of her chair.
C: AMELIA
D: Allow me to cut you a deal, my friend. Steel in the spine of that.
C: AMELIA
D: You show up tomorrow morning. You show up sober and you get me to Howland Island. Okay?
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: And I'll forget you ever said that. She WHEELS around and holding her slicker over her head, goes OFF into the POUNDING RAIN. Fred's smile is gone. He stares after her.
E: CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO...
S: EXT. RADIO HUT, LAE - LATER
N: Amelia down the path in her slicker toward a small hut. She knocks. Opens the door to reveal...
S: INT. RADIO HUT - NIGHT
N: ...the radio receiver and transmitter. The operator BALFOUR is a wiry Scot. He nods respectfully.
C: BALFOUR
D: Ready, Mum. He stands and she takes his seat. He shows her the key to press, then steps back toward the window. But she makes no move to the radio. Just stares at him. He doesn't understand. AMELIA Feel like stepping out for a smoke...?
E: gently
C: BALFOUR
D: I don't smoke.
C: AMELIA
D: ...or something? Oh. The monsoon beats down.
C: BALFOUR
D: If you need help, I'll be right outside. In the rain.
C: AMELIA
D: Thank you. I'll only be a moment.
N: He puts on his slicker. OPENS an umbrella. Leaves. She looks back to the radio. FLIPS the switch. E AMELIA (soft) arhart here. INTERCUT: COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - DAY George at a window, looking west. Over the Pacific. She's there somewhere.
C: EORGE
D: You should be sleeping. He smiles to keep his voice up. The eyes aren't smiling. We INTERCUT their conversation throughout...
C: AMELIA
D: You should be working.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm running a big adventure here, 'm a very important fellow.
C: AMELIA
D: You told me I was the star. And you were no one at all. GEORGE I thought I was lying. Guess the joke's on me. Silence.
E: soft
C: GEORGE
D: How's Fred?
E: CONT'D
C: AMELIA
D: I'm mad at him. I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay?
C: GEORGE
D: Don't keep me waiting.
C: AMELIA
D: I won't dare. You're a very important feline. Uh, fellow.
C: GEORGE
D: Talk to me about Fred.
C: AMELIA
D: Fred is fine. He's calculating head-wind speed versus fuel as we speak. CLOSE on his face.
C: GEORGE
D: You wouldn't sell a salesman would you?
C: AMELIA
D: He's fine.
C: GEORGE
D: So what's that I hear in your voice? A beat.
C: GEORGE
D: Is he drinking? AMELIA I can handle it.
E: soft
C: GEORGE
D: Call it off. Right now. I mean it.
C: AMELIA
D: I can handle it. And then...
C: AMELIA
D: I love you. Silence.
C: GEORGE
D: After the Fourth. We're going home.
C: AMELIA
D: Where's that?
C: GEORGE
D: For me? Anywhere you are. She begins to cry. Both hands fly to her mouth and she looks away. She swallows hard.
C: AMELIA
D: I'm going to like it there.
N: And then...
C: AMELIA
D: I'd better. Since this is my last flight. A long silence.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Well. If you insist. She nods. She does.
C: AMELIA
D: t's late here. Guess I'll go curl up under a teacup.
C: GEORGE
D: I'll go tell the world you're on your way. Neither wants to let go. We feel it so strong. GEORGE Sweet dreams. A beat. AMELIA See ya. And he's gone. She stares at the radio.
E: a whisper whispers back
S: INT. AMELIA'S HUT - LATER
N: FLICKER of a kerosene lamp. Amelia writing at a tiny desk. Thinks now. Thinks. Lost in it.
S: EXT. AIRFIELD, LAE - DAWN
N: A sober, contrite Fred comes down the runway in early light. As he reaches the Electra, he sees a pile of discarded OBJECTS on the tarmac... ...metal containers, carton of oranges, parachutes. Bedrolls, cold weather gear. Souvenirs from their stops: flags, a metal plaque, native crafts, a Welcome Miss Amelia Earhart banner. As he studies the pile... ...a COFFEE POT comes FLYING out of the plane to roll at his feet. Suddenly, a 10 pound coffee tin SAILS PAST, as he DUCKS. Amelia appears at the hatch, sees him.
C: FRED
D: You're finding the range. But it might be easier to just shoot me. She stares at him for a moment. A subdued voice...
C: AMELIA
D: Traveling light, that's all. She sits on the lip of the hatch. Her legs dangling. Her eyes down.
C: FRED
D: Got room for 190 pounds of asshole? No answer. She's still looking down. He's never seen her like this.
N: FRED (CONT'D) a'am, I am so sor...
C: AMELIA
D: It's fine. Her eyes come up.
C: AMELIA
D: Everything is. He doesn't understand, but he's glad to be forgiven. She takes a LETTER from her pocket. Runs her finger over the envelope.
E: CONT'D
C: FRED
D: I can run into town before we go. et that in the post for you. She shakes her head slowly.
C: AMELIA
D: It's for my husband. I'm going to hand it to him. So I can watch his face as he reads it. She sniffles slightly.
C: AMELIA
D: It's our tradition.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. RUNWAY, LAE AIRFIELD - MORNING
N: A RUNWAY that ends in a drop-off at the waters of Huon Gulf. The Electra, engines REVVING. Ready to go for it. Our ANGLE CLOSES on the belly of the plane. The ANTENNA MAST supporting a trailing WIRE ANTENNA.
C: GEORGE
D: Ten A.M., Friday July 2. They lined up on the thousand-yard runway. One thousand gallons of fuel, enough for 20 to 21 hours of flying. LONG ANGLE. Crew and onlookers watch as the plane STARTS its run, gathering speed, BOUNCING over uneven ground... CLOSE now on the jouncing undercarriage, a momentary PUFF of DUST, and as the plane moves PAST, we may notice that the belly antenna mast seems to be GONE. DOWN the runway it RUMBLES, still earthbound, only 200 yards to go. Then 100. Then FIFTY, then at the water's edge, the Electra RISES and...
E: V.O.
N: ..DROPS out of sight below the land, as we SMASH CUT to... ANGLE. The Electra has FALLEN to SIX FEET above the surface of the Gulf. The engines THROB at max, the propellers THROWING SPRAY. The overloaded plane... ...RISING. Slowly, then faster, then... ...SOARING free. PULL BACK to a VIEW from down the runway. The Electra in distance. RACK FOCUS to see something long and slender GLINTING on the ground. Could it be a length of WIRE?
S: INT. COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - SUNSET
N: Through the glass, the sun is disappearing toward Amelia. PULL BACK to George, staring at a CABLE in his hands. We HEAR...
C: BALFOUR
D: Mr. Putnam. Their headwinds are stronger than they knew when they took off. Then...
E: O.S.
C: BALFOUR
D: I recalculated their fuel. It will cost them 9%. George staring off. Assessing the consequences. PULL BACK to see an ENSIGN standing, waiting for instruction.
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: BALFOUR
D: I can't raise them, sir. I tried voice, and Morse Code...
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: George looks up. Calmly.

S: EXT. HOWLAND ISLAND - DAY
N: ERIAL ANGLE. A tiny, flat, nearly invisible speck adrift in the endless Pacific. Howland Island. PAN to see just offshore...
C: GEORGE
D: The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca had been anchored off Howland just for us. CLOSE on the ITASCA now...
E: V.O.
C: GEORGE
D: Its radio would be her lifeline. Its black plume of smoke would reach for miles. More visible than the island itself. DISSOLVE TO NIGHT. The island visible only by its slender LIGHTHOUSE. The ship illuminated in the darkness. CLOSE now on a path by the sea. A lone figure with a FLASHLIGHT approaches a SHACK. Enters...

S: INT. RADIO HUT - NIGHT
N: ...a room filled with radio equipment. He is FRANK CIPRIANI, in crisp naval uniform, relieving a SEAMAN who has been on duty. As Cipriani sits at his station, he notices...

D: The direction finder. How long has this been on? The seaman turns back at the door. What?
S: EXT. ITASCA
N: CLOSE on the ship, illuminated. PUSH IN...
S: INT. RADIO ROOM, ITASCA - NIGHT
N: The room is 9 x 20 with bare walls. At the transmitter, LEO BELLARTS the chief radio man. Short and square, an unflappable air of quiet expertise. With him, his assistant WILLIAM DALTEN, lean and young with dark serious eyes. At a typewriter sits THOMAS O'HARE, barely twenty, headphones across his shock of rust-colored hair, telegraph at the ready. UPERIMPOSE: 2:45 A.M. Dalten adjusting the receiver which is suddenly spitting STATIC. Threading through the noise, what could be a human voice. Bellarts calls to O'Hare...
C: BELLARTS
D: That's her on 3105. She said `cloudy and overcast.' O'Hare looks at him. Are you serious? Bellarts mimes typing with his fingers. O'Hare starts typing into the log.
T: DISSOLVE TO...
N: SUPERIMPOSE: 3:45 A.M. Radio CRACKLES. All eyes turn.
C: AMELIA
D: Itasca from Earhart. Overcast. Static. Dalten leans to the mic... DALTEN We are receiving your signal. Please acknowledge ours. What is your position? When do you expect to arrive Howland? No answer. Light static.
E: O.S. into mic
C: BELLARTS
D: Commander estimated 7:00. If she's having trouble on voice transmission, stay with Morse. And begins to carefully pack his pipe. Dalten begins to transmit Morse Code. DISSOLVE TO...
N: SUPERIMPOSE: 6:45 A.M. The radio. The static. The sudden voice...
C: AMELIA
D: Please take bearing on us and report in half hour. I will make noise in microphone. We are about 100 miles out. The transmission cuts out. Dalten answers in Morse Code. No response.
E: O.S.
C: DALTEN
D: She's got to stay on longer. Bellarts dictating as O'Hare types...
C: BELLARTS
D: Earhart signal strength 4, but on
N: ir so briefly bearings impossible.
T: DISSOLVE TO...
N: SUPERIMPOSE: 7:18 A.M. DALTEN (to Bellarts) Maybe her Morse receiver is out. (into mic) Can't take bearing on 3105. Please send on 500 or do you want to take bearing on us? Go ahead, please. Silence. O'Hare typing: NO ANSWER. SUPERIMPOSE: 7:30 A.M. DALTEN (into mic) Please acknowledge our signals on ey. Please acknowledge. CRACKLE. O'Hare typing: UNANSWERED.

N: A few others enter now. Civilians, sailors, they hang back silently, watching as... SUPERIMPOSE: 7:42 A.M.
C: AMELIA
D: KHAQQ calling Itasca. We must be on you but cannot see you... Glances are traded. It is the first moment of visible concern. STATIC interrupts. Then...
E: O.S.
C: AMELIA
D: Gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying t altitude 1000 feet. DALTEN You are reaching us. We are sending on 3105 and 500 constantly. Please acknowledge. Massive BURST of static. Dalten frantically CLICKING a message in Morse Code. DISSOLVE TO...
E: O.S. CONT'D into mic
N: UPERIMPOSE: 7:58 A.M. The room has nearly filled. COMMANDER THOMPSON stands at Bellart's shoulder. All eyes fixed on the radio...
C: EARHART
D: We are circling but cannot hear you. Go ahead on 7500. BELLARTS Itasca to KHAQQ. Your signal is strong. Are you receiving this? A breathless moment. A sharp CRACKLE.
E: O.S. into mic
C: EARHART
D: KHAQQ calling Itasca. We received your signal, but unable to get a minimum. Please take bearing on us and answer 3105 with voice. BELLARTS Your signal received okay. It is impractical to take a bearing on 3105 on your voice. Give us a longer signal, please. Go ahead. Silence. Feet are shifting. No one speaks.
E: O.S. into mic
N: BELLARTS (softly to Dalten) Keep us at 7500, that's her only acknowledgment.
C: THOMPSON
D: You've got her signal, dammit. What about the direction finder?
C: BELLARTS
D: Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir. It was left on all night. Full beat. THOMPSON I don't believe this is happening.
E: low
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: SUPERIMPOSE: 8:12 A.M. BELLARTS (into mic) Itasca to Earhart. Did you get transmission on 7500? Go ahead on 500 so that we can take a bearing on you, it's impossible on 3105. Please acknowledge.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: SUPERIMPOSE: 8:33 A.M. No breath in this room. No one moves. BELLARTS (into mic) Will you please come in and answer n 500? We are transmitting constantly on 7500 and we do not hear you on 500. Please answer on 500. Go ahead.

E: O.S.
N: BELLARTS (into mic) We hear you. We hear you. Can you receive this...? Silence. Silence. Silence. COMMANDER (softly) Mr. Bellarts. When did she say she was low on fuel? All eyes shift to Tommy. He scans the log. Stares.

T: SLOW DISSOLVE
N: TO...
S: INT. COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
N: The tiny room we've come to know. It is filled with people who stand motionless, staring somberly at one man. In turn, he stares at a telephone... Which RINGS. Mary reaches, but his hand goes UP and she pulls back. He lets it ring three times, four, gathering himself. Lifting it... GEORGE (into phone) Yes. There are no other words. His eyes tear up. He nods numbly at the phone. G
C: EORGE
D: Looking back, the questions were obvious. Why would anyone try to ind such a tiny target in a vast ocean, with barely an hour's lee- way in fuel? He draws a breath. GEORGE Well, we're most grateful. With such an effort, of course they'll e found.
E: V.O. CONT'D into phone

E: V.O.
