S: INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY
N: The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas. A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve. Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes, also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser. LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music. She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties. Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.
C: LETTY
D: Listen, Beast. What have I told you about linen?
N: The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.
S: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
N: Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill" from the counter and checks the time against her watch. She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.
C: LETTY
D: It's liver saute.
E: looking at Beast
N: Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can. LETTY Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But you're going to have to eat the liver tomorrow.
S: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
N: Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.
S: INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
N: Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.
S: EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
N: A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door. She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to turn the handle. Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody nose, runs up to her, bawling.
C: CHANDRA
D: Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.
N: Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.
C: LETTY
D: Goodness, this is a bad one. Tip your head back.
E: to Chandra
N: She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel, staining it for all eternity. Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.
C: LETTY
D: Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch it.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
N: PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and two other BOARD MEMBERS. Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her foot. Johansen clears his throat.
C: JOHANSEN
D: Well, I have a full calendar today, and I'm afraid...
N: The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her blood-smeared lapel.
C: LETTY
D: Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry I'm late. It's very nice to meet you.
N: Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending down to shake hands with Johansen and the others.
C: PRINCIPAL GAIL
D: The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
C: LETTY
D: I do apologize. A student had a crisis.
C: MRS. MONTES
D: A crisis, you say?
C: LETTY
D: A bloody nose...
N: There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase and reveals the stain.
C: LETTY
D: A bloody nose of epic proportions.
N: Johansen smiles.
C: JOHANSEN
D: OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes. Wow us.
S: EXT. PLAYGROUND - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
N: A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym. Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball game.
C: LETTY
D: No cherry drops, Jenny. Yes, hi. I'm calling for Paul Lascher. Could you tell him it's Letty? He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell him that they went for my math idea. Thanks.
E: into the phone beat beat
N: Letty dials again. She sees two boys fighting over the ball and moves in to break them up.
C: LETTY
D: Not so rough, guys. Mom? Hi. You'll never guess what...I've got the best news. No, about work. How about dinner?
E: to boys into phone beat
N: Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar. She blows a series of ANGRY, STACCATO NOTES on her whistle.
C: LETTY
D: You're in trouble, young lady. I know, Mom. But it's the only place I can call from. Can you tell Ruth about dinner? Paul's fine, just fine.
E: to Jenny into the phone beat beat
N: The class bell BUZZES.
C: LETTY
D: Got to go, Mom. The monsters call.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. Letty sits sipping wine with her mother, MRS. MARTHA MAYER, immaculate in a cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years. Letty's sister RUTH--early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant, oozing happiness. Letty discretely waves her over.
C: RUTH
D: Sorry I'm late.
N: Letty pours her a glass of wine.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Letty was just getting ready to tell me her good news.
C: RUTH
D: Tell, tell.
E: to Letty
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on your blouse?
E: leaning toward Letty
N: Letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse.
C: LETTY
D: So, I got the district to approve my after-school math program.
N: Ruth smiles at her, but vacantly.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: How wonderful, darling. What does that mean for you?
E: beat
C: LETTY
D: I'll be running it three days a week, and...
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Will you get time off to do that?
C: LETTY
D: Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
N: Ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit-eating grin plastered across her face.
C: LETTY
D: What's up with you?
E: to Ruth
C: RUTH
D: Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Not a job, a promotion.
E: to Ruth
C: LETTY
D: No, Mom, it's more of a prestige thing.
C: RUTH
D: Mmmmmmm.
N: Letty passes her hand in front of Ruth's eyes.
C: LETTY
D: Ruth. Calling Ruth.
C: RUTH
D: Sorry.
E: laughing
C: LETTY
D: Just go ahead and tell us.
C: RUTH
D: There's nothing to tell.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Are you sure, Dear?
E: to Ruth
C: LETTY
D: Come on.
C: RUTH
D: No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
C: LETTY
D: Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
N: Ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting.
C: RUTH
D: I'm getting married.
E: almost screaming
N: Mrs. Mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears. Ruth leaps up and hugs her mother. Other diners glance toward the table. One WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth. Other DINERS follow suit. Ruth grins back and starts to giggle.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I'm so happy for you. It's just wonderful.
N: Mrs. Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: My goodness. A wedding. My goodness.
C: LETTY
D: Wow. Congratulations.
N: Ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty.
C: RUTH
D: Can you believe it?
E: to Letty
N: Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse. She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and her mother, who peers at it with approval.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Tell us every detail.
C: LETTY
D: You've only known Jake a few months.
C: RUTH
D: Three and a week. Isn't it great?
E: screaming again
C: MRS. MAYER
D: My goodness. What about an engagement party? We must start planning. Champagne. Girls, we need some champagne.
E: signaling a waiter
N: Off Letty's frozen smile, we
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. PAUL LASCHER, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off his expensive suit. He opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly pressed T-shirt. He smooths out another shirt he has accidently rumpled in the process.
C: PAUL
D: So, another one bites the dust.
C: LETTY
D: It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
E: beat
C: PAUL
D: She's only known the guy a few months.
N: Paul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk.
C: PAUL
D: Can I put these here for tonight?
C: LETTY
D: In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
E: pointing to the closet beat
C: PAUL
D: I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
N: Paul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow.
C: LETTY
D: Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
C: PAUL
D: The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
N: Letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul.
C: LETTY
D: My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
C: PAUL
D: Good going. I knew you could do it.
N: Paul kisses Letty on the cheek.
C: PAUL
D: It looks like we're both bucking for advancement.
C: LETTY
D: Yeah?
C: PAUL
D: Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
N: Letty hugs Paul.
C: LETTY
D: Congratulations. We should celebrate.
C: PAUL
D: I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
C: LETTY
D: I mean tonight.
N: Letty sensually caresses his shoulders.
C: LETTY
D: Like right now...
C: PAUL
D: Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
C: LETTY
D: Oh, ok. Maybe.
C: PAUL
D: But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
C: LETTY
D: Sure. Of course.
E: beat
N: Letty continues coloring her multiplication chart.
C: PAUL
D: Letty, please, I need your full attention.
N: Letty puts the chart down and sits up straighter.
C: LETTY
D: Let me have it.
S: INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
N: Letty rubs her eyes with fatigue. Bobby stands next to her holding a crumpled paper bag.
C: BOBBY
D: My dog ate my turtle, and the shell went crunch. I brought it for show- and-tell.
N: The children perk up at this news.
C: LETTY
D: I'm sorry about your turtle Bobby, but you know we only have show-and- tell on Mondays. Today, we're scheduled for grammar.
C: BOBBY
D: But my mom says I have to throw it away tonight.
N: Bobby opens the bag. He reaches in to remove the turtle. The children TITTER. Letty's on him in a second.
C: LETTY
D: Don't even think about it.
N: She grabs the bag. From outside, there is a KNOCK. Letty and the students look toward the window. It's Ruth. She's been crying. She waves to Letty. Chandra waves back at Ruth. Letty puts up her finger to signal "just a minute" to Ruth. She sets the turtle bag on Bobby's desk.
C: LETTY
D: Class, why don't you...
N: Ruth knocks on the glass again. Letty glances at her distraught sister and walks quickly toward the door.
C: LETTY
D: You guys pull out your verb sheets and review them.
E: to class
N: Letty leaves the room. The class watches through the window as Ruth throws her sobbing self into Letty's arms.
S: EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - SAME
C: RUTH
D: She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
C: LETTY
D: Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
N: Letty glances through the window at her classroom, where Bobby waves the turtle over his head.
C: RUTH
D: How?
C: LETTY
D: I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
E: beat
C: RUTH
D: Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
N: Letty looks again at the classroom, where the students are lobbing the turtle back and forth.
C: LETTY
D: Maybe.
C: RUTH
D: You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
N: Letty's attention snaps back to Ruth.
C: LETTY
D: Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
C: RUTH
D: Please, Letty.
C: LETTY
D: Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
N: Ruth starts to sob--big, loud, air-gulping sobs. Letty pats her shoulder.
C: LETTY
D: Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
C: RUTH
D: Really?
N: Principal Gail, trolling the halls, spies Letty with Ruth. She dispatches a stern look in Letty's direction.
C: LETTY
D: You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
E: nodding toward Gail
C: RUTH
D: And the party?
C: LETTY
D: Yeah, it'll be fun.
N: Ruth grabs Letty in another hug.
C: RUTH
D: Thank you so much.
S: INT. CLASSROOM - SAME
N: Letty strides into the classroom, pulls the turtle away from Bobby and drops it in the trash.
C: LETTY
D: Who can come up here and give me a sentence with a "to be" verb in it?
C: ZACH
D: Who was that girl?
C: LETTY
D: Come on up, Zach.
N: Zach approaches the board and begins to write, "I am..." He doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off.
C: LETTY
D: Neater, Zach.
N: Zach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches "am."
C: LETTY
D: Zach, you know the line by the "a" has to come straight down or it looks like an "o."
N: Zach looks back toward his classmates for help.
C: LETTY
D: What's wrong, Zach?
N: Letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." She erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect.
C: LETTY
D: Try again, Zach. Like that.
N: Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes. He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and, above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at him. Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good "a."
C: LETTY
D: I don't believe it. You still can't do it.
C: ZACH
D: I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?
C: LETTY
D: No, it's not OK. You'll never get to college on OK.
N: Letty's fingers press into Zach's arm. A tear slides ominously down his cheek.
C: LETTY
D: It has to be good, Zach. Do you understand me?
N: Zach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around, unsure, confused. Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and looks at the children again. She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands. Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a deep breath and raises her head.
C: LETTY
D: I'm very, very sorry, Zach.
N: Zach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste.
C: LETTY
D: You know what, guys? Wednesday's not a grammar day. It's a collage day. It's a collage ON THE WALL day.
N: Letty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some paste. She motions for the students to join her. The children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind.
C: LETTY
D: And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be in charge of paste.
S: INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Letty lies in bed. The alarm clock BLASTS opera. Letty fumbles for the switch. She can't turn it off. She yanks out the cord. Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the second clock before it rings. She goes to the KITCHEN and snaps off the alarm, then heads down the HALLWAY and shuts that alarm off, as well. Letty hurries back to her BEDROOM and crawls into bed. Paul, toweling his hair dry, walks in.
C: PAUL
D: What are you doing? You're going to be late.
C: LETTY
D: I'm calling in sick.
N: Paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead.
C: PAUL
D: You don't have a fever.
C: LETTY
D: I don't feel like going to work today.
C: PAUL
D: Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
C: LETTY
D: It'll be OK.
C: PAUL
D: But what about that math project?
C: LETTY
D: Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
C: PAUL
D: Forget I asked.
C: LETTY
D: I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
E: beat
C: PAUL
D: Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
C: LETTY
D: No, it's not like that.
N: Letty starts to cry.
C: LETTY
D: It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week.
E: MORE
N: LETTY(cont'd) And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
C: PAUL
D: You can get out of the dinner.
C: LETTY
D: No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
C: PAUL
D: Come on, Letty. It'll get done.
N: Paul touches Letty's shoulder. She pulls away from him.
C: LETTY
D: I don't think so.
C: PAUL
D: Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
C: LETTY
D: Yeah.
C: PAUL
D: You just need to get more organized. L
C: LETTY
D: Maybe.
C: PAUL
D: Let's make a list of the things you need to do, OK?
N: Letty nods her head, and Paul grabs a legal pad from his briefcase.
S: INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT
N: MR. and MRS. ANDERSON, over-eager parents, sit across the desk from Letty, who stares at the legal pad in her lap. As the Andersons talk, Letty twists a lock of hair tighter and tighter.
C: MRS. ANDERSON
D: So at home, we've started our own little library for Chandra.
C: MR. ANDERSON
D: We thought it would be a good project for her to set up her own card-catalogue.
C: LETTY
D: I see.
N: Letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her hair.
C: MRS. ANDERSON
D: But what I'm wondering is whether we should also be spending more time on her computer skills at home. What do you think?
C: LETTY
D: Well...
C: MR. ANDERSON
D: Because we don't want her to get behind her classmates.
C: MRS. ANDERSON
D: And we trust your opinion. Chandra's always talking about Miss Mayer.
C: LETTY
D: Oh.
C: MR. ANDERSON
D: Just the other day she came home and told us about you taking care of her bloody nose.
C: MRS. ANDERSON
D: And she went on and on about the collage. That seems very inventive, Miss Mayer.
N: Letty stares blankly at the couple.
C: MR. ANDERSON
D: Miss Mayer?
C: LETTY
D: What the fuck. It's my job.
N: Off Mr. Anderson's raised eyebrow, we
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The room is a mess of scattered papers and the math Twister game. Letty sits on the ground crying. She makes a pyramid out of the wadded-up tissues that surround her.
S: INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY
N: The upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots of signs announcing "Sale Day." Frenzied women pick through dresses as "Pachelbel's Canon" plays in the background. Letty is wedged into a corner, sipping coffee. A CLERK approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries.
C: CLERK
D: More coffee?
C: LETTY
D: Hit me.
C: CLERK
D: Danish?
C: LETTY
D: No more bear claws left?
E: rooting through the tray
N: Ruth bounces into the shop.
C: CLERK
D: Danish?
E: to Ruth
C: RUTH
D: Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to eat.
N: The clerk gives Ruth an approving smile as Letty rips into a sweet roll. Ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns.
C: RUTH
D: Where's Mommy?
E: to Letty
C: LETTY
D: Do you have to call her Mommy?
C: RUTH
D: Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
C: LETTY
D: She said she'd be here at 10.
N: Ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up.
C: RUTH
D: What do you think of this one?
C: LETTY
D: I'd have to see it on.
N: Ruth looks closer at Letty.
C: RUTH
D: Have you been crying? Your eyes are all puffy.
N: Letty self-consciously touches her eyes.
C: LETTY
D: Things have been kind of stressful lately.
C: RUTH
D: But everything's OK?
N: Ruth is trying on a veil at this point.
C: LETTY
D: Yeah, everything's under control.
C: RUTH
D: What about the engagement party?
C: LETTY
D: Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
C: RUTH
D: Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
N: Letty sighs, moves to the racks and pulls out a dress.
C: LETTY
D: You better start trying on before the vultures get all the good ones.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER
N: uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up.
C: RUTH
D: What about this one?
C: LETTY
D: You look beautiful.
E: with sisterly pride
C: RUTH
D: Really?
C: LETTY
D: Truly.
N: Martha Mayer is led in by the clerk.
C: LETTY
D: Hi, Mom.
C: RUTH
D: Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: You look just wonderful, Ruthie. But I really think you should try on a few more, don't you?
N: Letty and Ruth shoot each other a look of doom.
S: INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER
N: A bedraggled Letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at dresses. They are bumped and jostled from all sides.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Has Paul heard about his promotion?
C: LETTY
D: No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
N: Ruth comes out of the dressing room in another gown.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I don't like the bias cut on that one.
N: Mrs. Mayer holds up an ornate dress.
C: RUTH
D: No more. I can't stand to try on one more dress.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Letty, I think this would be beautiful on you.
C: LETTY
D: Oh no.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Paul could pop the question at any time.
C: LETTY
D: Mom, please.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Especially with a promotion in the offing.
C: RUTH
D: Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
C: LETTY
D: Do you think I should?
E: to Ruth
C: RUTH
D: Yes, yes. It'll be fun.
N: Letty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room.
S: INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER
N: Letty emerges from the dressing room.
C: LETTY
D: Mom? Mom? Ruth?
N: Letty peers around the corner, becoming a tad frantic. But neither her mother nor Ruth is to be found. It's just Letty, resplendent in ecru satin.
C: CLERK
D: I think they went over to the next shop to take a peek at shoes.
N: Letty pushes back her veil, sits down on the floor and takes a sip of her now-cold coffee.
S: INT. LETTY'S LIVING/DINING ROOM - EVENING
N: A "House and Garden" picture of elegance. Letty, Paul, Ruth and Jake stand at nervous attention, decked out in their Sunday best. A KNOCK marks the first arrival. Letty opens the door to her mother, who does a quick reconnaissance of the room.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I gather he's late as usual.
C: LETTY
D: Can I get you a glass of champagne?
E: to her mother
N: The doorbell RINGS. Letty greets her father, a mid 50s business type, and his wife MONICA, a younger version of Letty's mother.
C: LETTY
D: Hi, Dad, Monica. I'm so glad you could come.
N: Suddenly, the parents are face-to-face, Letty standing between them.
C: LETTY
D: Mom, this is Monica. Monica, my mother, Martha.
N: The two Mrs. Mayers make appropriate MURMURS. Letty's parents stare each other down. Ruth shifts from foot to foot. Silence falls in the room with a thump.
C: LETTY
D: Dad, Mother, you've met before, right?
N: Ruth takes a dramatic gulp of air. The evening hangs in the balance. Finally,
C: MR. MAYER
D: How've you been, Martha?
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Mr. Mayer and Monica cozy up to each other on the love seat while Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Paul sit on the opposite couch. Letty passes hors d'oeuvres, and Jake doles out napkins.
C: LETTY
D: It's mushroom-time, folks.
C: MR. MAYER
D: I like the touch of cilantro. It is cilantro, isn't it?
E: biting into one
C: LETTY
D: You can always call it, Dad.
C: ONICA
D: You must get your cooking skills from your father, Letty.
N: Uncomfortable silence falls on the party. Monica wipes the edge of Mr. Mayer's mouth with her napkin.
C: LETTY
D: Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down to two, Dad.
C: MR. MAYER
D: Tell me about them.
C: RUTH
D: One's a silk...
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Not in front of Jake, Ruthie. It's bad luck.
N: Ruth looks at Letty nervously.
C: MONICA
D: I remember how hard it was looking for my dress. I must have been to 100 stores.
N: Mrs. Mayer clears her throat. More silence.
C: LETTY
D: You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
C: PAUL
D: Yes.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: That might be nice.
C: MR. MAYER
D: As long as you have...
C: LETTY
D: Puglia olives. Would I forget? A round of martinis coming right up.
E: beat
N: Letty leaves with Paul hot on her heels.
S: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
N: Letty shakes the martinis while Paul gets out the glasses. Ruth enters the kitchen and sidles up to Letty.
C: RUTH
D: How can I help?
C: LETTY
D: Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
C: RUTH
D: What about the souffle? Has that gone in?
C: LETTY
D: Yeah, I just put it in. But the squab, I think that needs to be basted.
N: Paul hands Letty the olive bottle.
C: PAUL
D: Kind of icy in there.
E: to Ruth
C: RUTH
D: Thank God we have alcohol.
E: to Paul
N: Letty skewers olives and puts them in the martinis. Bits of fleck rise from the olives, then swim to the tops of the glasses.
C: LETTY
D: Fuck me.
C: RUTH
D: What's the matter?
N: Letty grabs the olive bottle.
C: PAUL
D: Letty?
N: Letty stands still, fixated on the olive bottle.
C: PAUL
D: Let? L
C: LETTY
D: Olives Aux Herbes De Provence. I got the wrong kind of olives.
N: Ruth holds up a glass.
C: RUTH
D: What's all the dreck?
C: LETTY
D: Sage, rosemary... Les Herbes.
E: in a sarcastic French accent
C: RUTH
D: It'll be fine.
C: LETTY
D: No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
N: Jake enters. The three turn on him.
C: LETTY/PAUL/RUTH
D: You can't leave them alone./Get back in there./Are you nuts?
N: Jake whirls around and exits. Letty looks for olives, banging open the cupboards one after the other. Quicker and quicker. More and more frantic.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: Jake, Mr. Mayer, Monica and Mrs. Mayer stare at each other, listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the kitchen.
C: JAKE
D: What do you think of those Lakers?
S: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
N: Letty paws through her purse.
C: PAUL
D: What are you doing?
C: LETTY
D: Can you loan me a 20?
E: wild-eyed
C: PAUL
D: Sure. Why?
C: LETTY
D: I'm going to the store.
C: PAUL
D: I think you're overreacting.
N: Letty turns her best school marm look on Paul. He hands over a crisp bill.
C: RUTH
D: Letty, dinner's almost ready. The souffle...
C: LETTY
D: I'll be back before you can say souffle.
N: Letty leaves from the kitchen's back door. Ruth heads to the living room. Paul leans wearily against the counter, savoring one of the herb-filled martinis.
S: INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
N: Fluorescent lights beat down on Letty. She races through the aisles. She clutches her keys in one hand, a $20 bill in the other. Letty careens around a corner. At the last second, she avoids smacking into another shopper. She stops. LETTY'S POV: Shelf after shelf of olives...black olives...all black. BACK TO SCENE: Letty darts up and down the aisle, searching, searching. Nothing. Letty scurries to the front of the store. She taps a STORE CLERK on the shoulder. Six people waiting in line mutter, annoyed.
C: LETTY
D: I can't find martini olives. All you have are black.
C: STORE CLERK
D: Aisle 2A.
E: without looking up
N: Letty whips down an aisle. She starts to sweat. An OLD LADY blocks her path.
C: OLD LADY
D: Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the cat food.
N: Letty pauses. She reaches up and hands the woman a can of food.
C: OLD LADY
D: And a turkey and giblets, too, please. She does like her turkey.
N: Letty grabs another can, throws it in the Old Lady's cart and darts away while the Old Lady continues to talk. LETTY'S POV: The sign for Aisle 2A. Olives. Lots of them. Green. All shapes. All sizes. BACK TO SCENE: Letty's shoulders relax. She scans the shelf. LETTY's POV: Labels of olives: big, small, with pimentos, without. None from Puglia, Italy. BACK TO SCENE: Letty zooms back to the front of the store. To the clerk.
C: LETTY
D: They're not there. I need the ones from Puglia.
N: She gets no response from the clerk, who counts change for a customer. Letty gestures wildly with her hands.
C: LETTY
D: They're the ones that are packed in brine, but they don't overpower the, you know, the palate.
C: STORE CLERK
D: Specialty foods. 7B.
E: without looking up
N: Letty's off again. To the land of pink peppercorns, dehydrated mushrooms and Chinese 5-Spice. But no olives. Not a single bottle. Letty paws through the shelves, knocking things over as she scours the aisle. She is oblivious to the mess that surrounds her. An EMPLOYEE with a price checker walks half-way down the aisle. He spots Letty and rushes away.
C: LETTY
D: Where are they? Where are they?
N: More and more items crash to the ground. Letty is beyond frenzied.
C: EMPLOYEE
D: Manager to 7B. Manager please.
E: OS FILTERED
C: LETTY
D: Where are they?
N: Letty pounds her fist against the shelf. More goods fall. Shoppers stare. The Manager rushes toward Letty.
C: MANAGER
D: What's wrong, Miss?
C: LETTY
D: Tell me where they are.
N: She gestures. She knocks over a bottle of fat-free Lingonberry preserves. It crashes to the floor, spewing jam.
C: MANAGER
D: I think you should go now.
C: LETTY
D: I need my olives.
C: MANAGER
D: It's time to leave.
N: The Manager places his hand on the small of Letty's back as if to guide her out of the store. Letty backs away. The manager grabs hold of her wrist. Letty whacks him in the shoulder with her free hand. She pushes him away. Hard. He staggers against the opposite shelf. Customers and employees gather at both ends of the aisle, riveted by the spectacle.
C: MANAGER
D: Call security. Where's security, please?
N: Letty takes her arm and slides a shelf-full of products onto the floor. They crash and break. She screams.
C: LETTY
D: Fucking olives. Fucking, fucking olives.
N: Two SECURITY GUARDS turn the corner. Letty spots them. One creeps closer.
C: LETTY
D: No, no, no. Go away.
N: Guard One continues to approach, cooing encouragingly. Letty throws a jar at him. It clips him in the head. He turns away, bleeding. Guard Two pulls out a billy club.
C: MANAGER
D: Call police. Now.
E: yelling
N: Letty stops. Dazed. She turns around. Guard Two walks toward her. His stance suggests he's stalking a wild animal. Letty tries to brush off the jam that dribbles down her skirt. She looks to both ends of the aisle. LETTY'S POV: Faces, dozens and dozens of faces, stare down at her. People point. One boy LAUGHS. BACK TO SCENE: Letty backs against the shelf. She slides down it until she is sitting on the floor. She buries her head in her knees, sobbing.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
N: The room is furnished like a Hyatt Hotel minus anything you might use to kill yourself. Letty sleeps. MICHAEL, mid 30's, in jeans and T-shirt, sits in a chair next to the bed. He looks intently at Letty, checks his watch and taps her on the shoulder. She stirs.
C: MICHAEL
D: Miss Mayer? Miss Mayer?
N: LETTY'S POV: Everything's a morning blur. Gradually, items come into focus -- the intercom for the nurse, the door with a window in it, the three tissue boxes on the bedside table. It's a hospital, all right. Letty's vision is filled suddenly by Michael's concerned face peering into hers. BACK TO SCENE:
C: MICHAEL
D: I know you've had a rough night, but I have a few questions for you, Miss Mayer, or Letitia.
N: Letty pulls herself up to a sitting position.
C: MICHAEL
D: Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
C: LETTY
D: Letty.
C: MICHAEL
D: First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
E: consulting his notes
C: LETTY
D: I answered these questions last night.
C: MICHAEL
D: I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
C: LETTY
D: Hillview Psychiatric Hospital.
C: MICHAEL
D: Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to remember three items. I'm going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes. They are chair, cup and ball. Did you get that?
N: Letty nods.
C: MICHAEL
D: OK, let's subtract 6 from a succession of numbers starting with
N: LETTY
C: MICHAEL
D: And 85 minus 6?
N: LETTY Michael waits.
C: LETTY
D: No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
C: MICHAEL
D: It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing. Letty smiles uncomfortably.
C: MICHAEL
D: Now the three things I asked you to remember.
C: LETTY
D: Chair, cup and ball.
C: MICHAEL
D: Terrific.
N: Letty smiles, a real smile this time.
C: MICHAEL
D: Let me shift gears here a minute... Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
E: beat
C: LETTY
D: No.
C: MICHAEL
D: What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
N: Letty shakes her head "no."
C: MICHAEL
D: How about arranging your possessions in a certain way?
N: Letty pauses.
C: MICHAEL
D: Yes? Go right ahead.
C: LETTY
D: Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
N: Michael leans closer.
C: MICHAEL
D: How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
C: LETTY
D: By color.
C: MICHAEL
D: What if it's got a pattern?
C: LETTY
D: Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
C: MICHAEL
D: I see. How long has it been since you've done something you've enjoyed, Letty?
E: looking at his notes
C: LETTY
D: A while, I guess.
E: beat
C: MICHAEL
D: That must be really difficult.
N: Letty tears up. Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm.
C: MICHAEL
D: Hey, it'll be OK. We'll make sure of that.
N: Letty gives him an appreciative look.
C: MICHAEL
D: For now, why don't you just take it easy while I confer with my colleagues. A nurse should be in shortly.
S: INT. LETTY'S ROOM - LATER
N: Letty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed. She writes in her organizer. DR. ROBERT EMLEE, early 40s and in jeans, enters with his own organizer.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
C: LETTY
D: I did this already.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: It's hospital policy...
C: LETTY
D: To be interviewed every hour?
C: DR. EMLEE
D: I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
C: LETTY
D: Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
C: LETTY
D: Yeah, and a dimple.
N: Dr. Emlee shifts uncomfortably.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
C: LETTY
D: Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: Patient.
C: LETTY
D: What?
C: DR. EMLEE
D: Michael, the man who came to see you, is a patient.
C: LETTY
D: What kind of place is this?
C: DR. EMLEE
D: I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
C: LETTY
D: I want to see my mother immediately.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
C: LETTY
D: I don't think you understand. I won't wait.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: You'll have to. Your family agreed to the conditions not to see you when they admitted you to Hillview, Letitia. We can talk about how that makes you feel, but we can't change the rules.
E: beat
N: Letty sinks back on her pillows, the wind knocked out of her.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: Dr. Stone's evaluation from last night indicates you're experiencing a great deal of anxiety, probably related to depression...
N: LETTY'S POV: Dr. Emlee continues to talk. His words become more and more distant as the RINGING in Letty's head grows louder.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: We need to talk about starting you on drug therapy. Most depressive personalities benefit from a drug like Prozac or maybe Zoloft...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
N: It's a bigger version of a waiting room you'd find in a doctor's office. And it has more games. Some patients watch television. Others play pool. Several form a group around Michael, who holds the same notebook he used in his session with Letty. JOHN, unkempt in a bathrobe, hands him a few ratty dollar bills.
C: JOHN
D: I'm in for 5 for manic depressive.
N: THOMAS, late 40s and in a suit, waves a $5 bill at Michael.
C: THOMAS
D: I'll go with that as well.
N: Michael takes the money, and turns to MARIE, late 30s.
C: MARIE
D: You two always bet manic depressive. to Michael) Tell me more about the guard she strangled.
E: to John and Thomas
C: MICHAEL
D: No, just hit in the head.
C: JOHN
D: What about voices? Does she hear voices?
C: MICHAEL
D: Not that she admits to.
C: MARIE
D: Is she a washer?
C: MICHAEL
D: No, but she is exceptionally organized.
C: THOMAS
D: How organized?
C: MICHAEL
D: She arranges her underwear by color.
N: Michael motions to MRS. HALLSTROM, mid 50s, who shuffles by.
C: MICHAEL
D: Mrs. Hallstrom, you want in?
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: All tapped out.
C: MICHAEL
D: I'll float you.
N: Mrs. Hallstrom keeps walking.
C: MARIE
D: It's been weeks since she played.
E: to Michael
C: MICHAEL
D: What about you, Marie?
C: MARIE
D: I'll say major depression complicated by obsessive compulsive disorder. And could I get my change in ones?
E: handing Michael a $20 bill beat
S: INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
N: Letty lags behind NURSE GATES, early 30s and in civilian clothes, as they walk down the hall.
C: NURSE GATES
D: Treatment schedules are posted on the bulletin board. Dinner at 6, lights out at 10 and no fraternizing between patients.
N: Letty nods.
C: NURSE GATES
D: That's the rec room. We show movies there on Wednesdays and Fridays...And this is the dining hall.
E: pointing as she goes
N: Letty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room, an upscale version of a college cafeteria. Groups of people eat and talk. A paper airplane sails from one table to another.
C: LETTY
D: I'm really not that hungry.
C: NURSE GATES
D: Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
C: LETTY
D: You know, my mom's coming to get me tomorrow. I'll be leaving.
C: NURSE GATES
D: It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here with you.
S: INT. DINING HALL - SAME
N: Nurse Gates guides Letty to a table where John, Mrs. Hallstrom, Marie and Thomas sit.
C: THOMAS
D: So I said to my publisher this afternoon, I said, don't you even--
C: NURSE GATES
D: Hi, gang. I want to introduce you to Letty. Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and Marie, and John and Thomas.
E: interrupts to Letty
C: THOMAS
D: Just discussing my pesky publisher. May I ask what you do when you're not vacationing?
E: to Letty
C: MARIE
D: Let the poor girl get some food, for Heaven's sake.
E: to Thomas
C: LETTY
D: I'm a teacher.
C: THOMAS
D: As you may have gathered, I'm a writer.
N: John snorts. Thomas ignores him. Mrs. Hallstrom stares down at her plate.
C: THOMAS
D: I don't like to say novelist. That sounds a little grandiose, but I am on my third novel and...
C: NURSE GATES
D: Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas, but we really should get some food...
N: Nurse Gates leads Letty to a table, and hands her a plate. Letty looks up to see Michael at the other end of the table, doing a card trick for two OTHER PATIENTS.
C: MICHAEL
D: Now I'm going to say that the card you picked was the Ace of Spades.
E: to patients
N: He flips the top card up and it's the Ace of Spades. The patients chortle.
C: NURSE GATES
D: Michael.
N: Michael turns toward the nurse.
C: NURSE GATES
D: Michael, this is Letty. She just arrived yesterday.
N: Letty stares at Michael coldly.
C: LETTY
D: We've met. I missed you during rounds this morning.
E: to Michael
N: Letty turns and leaves, carrying her empty plate with her.
C: NURSE GATES
D: This doctor thing has got to stop.
E: to Michael
N: Nurses Gates hurries after Letty.
S: EXT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Letty stands outside the waiting room door. She tucks her blouse into her jeans and enters.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Letty's mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that looks much like the library of an English country manor. She springs up as soon as she spots Letty. They rush to each other. Letty's mother strokes her hair.
C: RS. MAYER
D: I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
C: LETTY
D: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Oh, Letty, what happened?
C: LETTY
D: Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so...
E: MORE
N: LETTY(cont'd) They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
C: LETTY
D: I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
C: LETTY
D: I just want to go home. Can we go home now?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I think the best thing for you right now is to stay here and get well.
C: LETTY
D: Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
N: Letty listens, waits, can't absorb it.
C: LETTY
D: You all really think I need to be here?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Yes.
C: LETTY
D: But what about Beast? Who'll...?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Ruth's already taken him home.
C: LETTY
D: And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Paul said he'd call the school. And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
E: beat
C: LETTY
D: Charges?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: For his injuries. I guess you...I guess he got hit in the head.
N: Mrs. Mayer holds out a duffel bag to Letty.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I packed up some of your clothes, and I can bring whatever else you need.
N: Letty refuses to accept the duffel bag. Her mother sets it on the floor and stands. Letty is five again.
C: LETTY
D: Mom, no, please don't go. Please.
N: Letty's mother holds her. Mrs. Mayer, crying, pulls away from Letty. She kisses her daughter on the cheek.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I'll see you soon.
C: LETTY
D: Tomorrow?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
N: Letty's mother walks out the door. Letty stares after her.
S: INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Letty, crying, unpacks her duffel bag, laboriously smoothing and refolding every item she puts in the drawer. Finishing her task, Letty goes to the mirror and stares at her reflection. Finally, she fixes her makeup. Letty leaves her room. We follow her FOOTSTEPS down the hallway. In the distance, Letty sees the Rec Room. She hears the CLAMOR of voices. Every step is agony. Letty stops herself just before entering, trying to collect herself.
C: MICHAEL
D: Four people bet OCD and clinical depression so I split the pool.
E: O.S.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, her diagnosis was no mystery.
E: O.S.
C: MARIE
D: Especially the OCD.
N: Sick realization spreads over Letty's face.
C: JOHN
D: Fuck, I mean, anyone who color- codes her panties has big problems.
E: O.S.
N: Letty freezes. Michael rounds the corner. He stops when he sees her, falters, recovers his composure.
C: MICHAEL
D: Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
C: LETTY
D: You took bets on my diagnosis?
C: MICHAEL
D: It's no big deal. We all compare.
C: LETTY
D: ho do you think you are?
E: voice rising
S: INT. REC ROOM - SAME
N: Patients are grouped in front of the TV, watching Bill Murray. Heads turn as they hear shouting in the hallway. Not even a moment's hesitation before, one by one, they get up and hurry to the hall. Only Mrs. Hallstrom remains.
S: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
N: John, Marie and others gather around the fighters.
C: MICHAEL
D: Don't take it personally.
C: LETTY
D: You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
C: MICHAEL
D: Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
C: LETTY
D: I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
C: JOHN
D: He's schizophrenic.
E: to Letty
C: LETTY
D: I'm not the one who's schizophrenic. I don't see people who aren't there or run around acting crazy.
N: Letty pounds her fist against the wall.
C: PATIENTS
D: Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael.
C: MICHAEL
D: Oh, no, you're perfectly sane. That's why you're here.
N: Letty looks like she's been slapped. She thinks for a moment. The patients wait, breathless, for her retort.
C: LETTY
D: Go fuck yourself.
N: Michael grins at Letty. She turns, and strides down the hall. There's a smattering of applause. It grows stronger. We see Letty's eyes fill with tears as, behind her, the patients yell.
C: PATIENTS
D: Bravo./Encore./Re-match.
S: INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Letty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns. She gets out of bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself together. She slumps to the floor and starts to cry.
S: INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
N: r. Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding chairs. Michael, who sits next to Emlee, practices rolling a quarter back and forth across his fingers. Letty sits across from Michael and Emlee, her legs and arms crossed tightly. The group concentrates on Mrs. Hallstrom.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: I can't stop thinking about the things I did wrong when my daughter was little.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: And how's that make you feel?
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: I just feel like sleeping. All the time.
C: THOMAS
D: Hell's bells, you can count me in on that. I haven't had enough Z's since I ran those sleep disorder experiments at Stanford back in the 70s.
C: MARIE
D: We really miss doing things with you, Mrs. Hallstrom.
N: Michael, sitting next to Mrs. Hallstrom, squeezes her arm.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: Maybe when I hit my manic phase again.
N: Group members smile.
C: JOHN
D: I've noticed Letty doesn't much like to do things with us.
N: The group looks expectantly at Letty.
C: LETTY
D: Oh, no. Of course I do.
C: JOHN
D: Then why are you so defensive?
C: MICHAEL
D: I don't think we need to sacrifice Letty to pep up a slow session.
E: to John
C: JOHN
D: You're the one who told everyone about her panties.
E: to Michael
N: Michael grimaces at John. Letty's head is bent down.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: Maybe you'd like to share some of your feelings about OCD or depression with us, Letty.
N: Letty eyes the doctor. She's dangerously close to tears.
C: LETTY
D: Do we have to talk about this?
C: DR. EMLEE
D: I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
N: Michael reaches his hand behind Dr. Emlee's head, catching Letty's eye in the process. Michael pulls a silver dollar out of Emlee's ear. Letty looks but doesn't respond. The other patients ignore Michael. Emlee is oblivious.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: You never know, Letty, how the person sitting next to you may be able to shed light on one of your problems...
N: Michael goes for a bigger trick. Reaching again behind the doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers. Letty, almost against her will, smiles.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: ...by revealing something that's going on in his or her own life.
N: Michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's head. Letty's smile broadens.
C: DR. EMLEE
D: There, now, I knew you'd feel better once we discussed group process. Let's talk a little about your OCD.
E: responding to her smile
S: INT. LIBRARY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Letty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks. Michael turns the corner, thumbing through a dog-eared book. Letty spots him and moves away. Michael sidles up next to her.
C: ICHAEL
D: Looking for a romance?
C: LETTY
D: Excuse me?
C: MICHAEL
D: What are you looking to read?
C: LETTY
D: Anything interesting.
N: Michael holds out his book to her.
C: MICHAEL
D: This is good.
N: Letty glances at the title, "101 MAGIC TRICKS."
C: LETTY
D: But you're checking it out.
C: MICHAEL
D: I've already checked it out 17 times.
N: Michael reaches behind Letty. She pulls away. He produces a scarf from behind her back, and presents it to her. She doesn't take it.
C: LETTY
D: You keep the book. I'm looking for Emily Dickinson.
N: Letty walks away. Michael follows.
C: MICHAEL
D: Hey, if you take the magic book, I'll feel like maybe you accept my apology and don't hate me anymore.
N: Letty hesitates.
C: LETTY
D: I haven't heard an apology.
N: Michael drops to one knee.
C: MICHAEL
D: I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings. I got a little carried away. Can you ever forgive me?
N: Letty takes the book from him and walks away.
S: INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Letty sits in an arm chair staring out at the garden. Her attention is drawn to a nearby couch where Michael sits opposite Mrs. Hallstrom, apparently playing cards. Michael lays a card down.
C: MICHAEL
D: Mrs. Hallstrom, I'm pretty sure you could use that.
N: She shakes her head slowly back and forth. Michael places it in her hand of cards.
C: MICHAEL
D: Now, don't you have a gin rummy, Mrs. Hallstrom? Go ahead, now, just lay those cards down.
E: beat
N: Mrs. Hallstrom slowly spreads her hand of cards on the couch.
C: MICHAEL
D: Hot damn. Gin rummy. I told you so. You're three games up on me.
N: Mrs. Hallstrom smiles. Michael catches Letty watching them, and Letty quickly looks away.

N: Paul takes Letty's hand in his.
C: PAUL
D: Will you marry me?
N: Paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on Letty's finger. She stares at it, mesmerized.
C: PAUL
D: I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
C: LETTY
D: Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
E: by rote
C: PAUL
D: I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines. Letty?

C: LETTY
D: Do you think, really, that it's OK to get engaged when I'm in here?

C: LETTY
D: What have you done with the ring?
C: MICHAEL
D: It's magic.
N: Letty stands up.

E: to audience to Letty

N: Letty climbs into bed. She opens the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Tiffany's ring box. There, cradled in the satin lining, is the diamond from Paul. Right beside it is Michael's Cracker Jack special. Letty puts on Paul's ring. She studies her hand. With an air of secrecy, she slips on Michael's ring. She quickly takes it off. Wearing Paul's ring, she turns off the light and snuggles into bed.
S: EXT. GARDEN, HILLV IEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned hedges and tea roses.

C: LETTY
D: I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
C: RUTH
D: Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.

D: I mean, you can always send me fabric samples to look at or pictures of dresses. But, it's been so long since we've seen each other.

D: Of course. You're right. Besides, we should be talking about your engagement.
N: They start walking again.

N: Nurse Gates passes by the open door, and pokes her head in.
C: NURSE GATES
D: Lights out, Letty.
N: Letty closes the door. She pulls a nightshirt from a drawer, disrupting a perfectly-folded T-shirt. Letty bends down to straighten it, but changes her mind. She shuts the drawer. Letty puts on the nightshirt, crawls into bed and snaps off the light. She fluffs her pillow, and turns over. She rolls back. Letty turns on the light. She goes to the drawer, opens it, pulls out the T-shirt and refolds it. She shuts the drawer. Letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork. It's a fight with the drawer. Opened and closed. Until Letty takes a deep breath, pulls it open a final time, hesitantly ruffles the T-shirt and slams the drawer shut. She runs to bed and hops in, turning off the light and burying her head under the pillow. A few moments pass. A KNOCK on the door. Letty opens it to find Michael.
C: LETTY
D: We're supposed to be asleep.
C: MICHAEL
D: Exactly.
N: Michael takes Letty's hand and pulls her toward the door.

C: JIM
D: All the same, rules are rules.

Letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where Michael plays frisbee with his family, even his grandmother, ROSA. Nurse Gates walks up to Letty.
C: NURSE GATES
D: Your mother's in the rec room, Letty.
S: INT. REC ROOM - SAME
N: Letty passes Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits by herself, holding one small gift on her lap. Letty spots her Mom across the room, and walks up to her. Her mother has covered a table with swatches of fabric.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
C: LETTY
D: You too, Mom.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: You're looking good. A little thin, but good.
N: Letty examines a fabric sample.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Thanks so much for doing this. Ruthie and Jake are up to a million things. And I just can't decide.
N: Letty rearranges the fabric samples on the table by color.
C: LETTY
D: Which flowers did you order?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
C: LETTY
D: Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
N: Letty holds up a swatch of bright yellow.
C: LETTY
D: This would complement the blue in the bride's maids' dresses. Look.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Where's your ring, Sweetheart?
C: LETTY
D: We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you. Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
E: beat
N: Letty pulls out a cigarette, lights it and starts smoking.
C: LETTY
D: I haven't had a crush since I was
C: MRS. MAYER
D: When did you start smoking?
C: LETTY
D: I'll put it out if it bothers you.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: The puckering, dear. It doesn't seem so now, but in time, it will cause wrinkles around the mouth.
N: Letty grinds the cigarette beneath her heel. She bends over the fabrics.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: You know, your life isn't about being in a mental hospital.
C: LETTY
D: What?
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
C: LETTY
D: Mom, please.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
C: LETTY
D: Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
N: Thomas, who sits across the room, looks up from his book.
C: MRS. MAYER
D: I'm only looking out for you.
E: whispering
C: LETTY
D: And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
E: yelling
N: Letty races out the door and into the garden. In the distance, Michael spots her and jogs over. Letty's mother watches them. Thomas approaches Mrs. Mayer.
C: THOMAS
D: Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I couldn't help overhearing. I just wanted to say, not that it's any of my business...
C: MRS. MAYER
D: Yes?
C: THOMAS
D: I think, really, I think I'd go with the cream damask. NT. REC ROOM - LATER
N: Letty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining hall. Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits where we last saw her.
C: NURSE GATES
D: It's OK to be upset.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: Upset? Why of course not. My goodness, no. I'm sure she just got hung up.
E: gaily
N: Letty and Michael stop.
C: MICHAEL
D: Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
C: LETTY
D: If you change your mind, we'll be in the dining hall.
N: Michael and Letty walk on, exchanging a sad look.
S: INT. DINING HALL - LATER
N: Mr. Santucci and Mrs. Santucci sit at the heads of the table. Letty sits between Rosa and Michael.
C: ROSA
D: What do you need now? Send down the lamb. This girl's as thin as a stick.
E: to Letty to Mr. Santucci
C: LETTY
D: Oh, no. I'm stuffed.
C: ROSA
D: Tell her to eat, Frank.
C: MR. SANTUCCI
D: Mangia. Mangia.
C: MICHAEL
D: You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's lamb.
E: whispering to Letty
C: ROSA
D: Or my eggplant. I make the best eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I use, it's so fresh it sweats.
N: Letty heaps more food on her plate.
C: MRS. SANTUCCI
D: Michael says you're a teacher.
C: LETTY
D: I was. I'm hoping I'll still have a job when I get out.
N: Mrs. Hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her Christmas stocking cap. She starts to dispense erasers.
C: LETTY
D: What's she doing?
N: Mrs. Hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on Grandma Rosa. She hands Rosa the gift meant for her daughter.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: Rosa, Rosa, you must have this, Rosa.
C: ROSA
D: Grazie.
C: MICHAEL
D: Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please.
N: But, by this point, Mrs. Hallstrom's already bounded away, divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered parents and delighted children. She clambers onto a table in the middle of the room. Marie gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho, ho, ho.
C: LETTY
D: Michael, we've got to stop her.
N: Michael pushes back his chair. He's trapped between the table and the wall.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: My goodness, it's so very warm in here. So warm.
N: She takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking man. But she doesn't stop there. With haphazard abandon, she begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt.
C: MRS. HALLSTROM
D: Way, way, way too warm for December. Now, let's sing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way...
N: The group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior. Then, almost as one, the patients spring into action. Michael bolts over his dining table and runs to Mrs. Hallstrom. He jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her. By this time, John, Thomas and Letty have surrounded her in a protective enclave. Michael sets Mrs. Hallstrom on the ground. She looks up at the group, and continues belting out "Jingle Bells." NT. LINEN CLOSET - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT Letty and Michael lie on the floor next to each other, trading puffs on a cigarette. The glowing ember is the only light in the room.

E: beat
C: MICHAEL
D: The mission up in Santa Barbara.
C: LETTY
D: No way.
C: MICHAEL
D: That's where I always go when I get out.
C: LETTY
D: Why?
C: MICHAEL
D: My dad used to take me there when I was little. It's totally quiet. And you can see the ocean for miles.
N: They smoke for a while.
C: LETTY
D: What else would you do?
C: MICHAEL
D: I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
C: LETTY
D: And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
C: MICHAEL
D: How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
C: LETTY
D: I have a terrible confession.
C: MICHAEL
D: Tell the doctor.
C: LETTY
D: I don't like lamb.
N: Michael sits up.
C: MICHAEL
D: Then it's over.
C: LETTY
D: Lie down.
N: Michael lies down.
C: MICHAEL
D: It's a good thing my family loves you.
C: LETTY
D: Your family just met me.
C: MICHAEL
D: You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
C: LETTY
D: Do you?
C: MICHAEL
D: I do.
C: LETTY
D: Michael, I...
C: MICHAEL
D: It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
C: LETTY
D: But I do. I love you, too.
N: Michael and Letty lie still, looking into each others eyes.

C: MICHAEL
D: What? What?
E: to the corner
N: Nothing's there. Nothing at all. But Michael keeps staring. A KNOCK on the door. Michael's eyes refocus. He opens the door to find Letty.
C: LETTY
D: John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
C: MICHAEL
D: Oh, right. I'm ready. How do I look?
C: LETTY
D: Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
E: straightening his tie
N: Letty hands him the Cracker Jack ring.
S: INT. COMMITMENT COURT - DAY
N: Michael sits near the front of the courtroom with half a dozen other patients from various institutions. Nurse Gates sits a few rows back near JOHN'S MOTHER and Michael's family--Mr. and Mrs. Santucci and Grandma Rosa. JUDGE MILTON, 60s, questions John, who's on the stand.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: Why have you petitioned to leave the institution?
C: JOHN
D: I haven't had an episode in more than a month, Sir.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: How do you plan to support yourself?
C: JOHN

D: Where will you live upon release?
C: JOHN

N: John's mother nods encouragingly at him.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: Where do you plan to reside, Mr. Lockyer?
C: JOHN
D: With my mother.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: Is your mother here today?
N: John points to her. John's mother waves at the judge.
C: JOHN
D: That's the bitch. That cock- sucking bitch. She put me here. She did. She's the Satan that did this all.
N: As bailiffs remove John from the stand, Michael offers a wan smile to his family.
S: INT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER
N: Michael, outwardly poised and collected, sits on the stand. His hands are clenched in tight fists.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: The records indicate no major episodes in the past four months. And it seems you have the support of the staff.
C: MICHAEL
D: Yes, Sir.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: But I see you've been in and out of the hospital more than ten times.
C: MICHAEL
D: Eleven, Your Honor. But I'm on a new medication now.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: Do you feel ready to re-enter the world?
C: MICHAEL
D: Yes, Sir. My family is prepared to support me until I find a job. They've already located an apartment for me that's very near them.
C: JUDGE MILTON
D: Very well, then. By order of the court, you are released. I wish you good luck.
N: Michael's shoulders relax. He opens his fist. Inside is the Cracker Jack ring, and the magenta circle it has imprinted on his palm.

C: LETTY
D: I don't mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.

C: LETTY
D: I've met someone else.
C: PAUL
D: Who?
C: LETTY
D: It doesn't matter who.
C: PAUL
D: Have you been seeing another teacher?
C: LETTY
D: No.
C: PAUL
D: It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
C: LETTY
D: He's a patient here.
N: Paul considers this a moment.
C: PAUL
D: Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
C: LETTY
D: I love him.
C: PAUL
D: You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
C: LETTY
D: Here's the ring.
C: PAUL
D: No way. You keep the ring. You'll come to your senses.
