T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
N: ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK. A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes the old women. They SCREAM! The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes them. The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR. The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY, flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and flashes ANOTHER GIRL. It's an all-out Pervert assault! The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an assassination.
S: INT. MALL - BUSINESS OFFICES - DAY
N: MARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and complain loudly.
C: MARK
D: Ladies, please, we're doing everything we can to handle the situation. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our shoppers. Now in the meantime, feel free to check out some of our wonderful back-to- school sales. Excuse me for a minute.
N: Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S desk.
C: MARK
D: Have you seen Ronnie?
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: I haven't seen him all morning.
N: The Mall Manager quickly walks off. On the way, he passes a JANITOR.
C: MARK
D: Ramon, have you seen Ronnie?
C: JANITOR
D: No, senor.
N: The Mall Manager keeps walking.
S: INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
N: The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's a small office with monitors that show the different security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word ever, turns around in the chair.
C: MARK
D: Where is Ronnie?
N: Dennis shrugs.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GARAGE - DAY
N: Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose. A garage door raises and bright light spills in...
S: EXT. GARAGE - DAY
N: A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around. The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall security guard whose expression reads all business. Ronnie pulls out of the garage... SUPERIMPOSE: OBSERVE AND REPORT
S: EXT. MALL - DAY
N: HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over. Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max. The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot. The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase. As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them.
C: RONNIE
D: Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
E: cop authority voice
N: STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.
C: STEVIE
D: Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a parking lot.
C: RONNIE
D: Sir, pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
N: HECTOR, another skater, joins in.
C: HECTOR
D: Leave us alone.
C: STEVIE
D: Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.
C: RONNIE
D: Skateboarding is not allowed on mall premises. Pull over now!
C: STEVIE
D: We're not leaving.
C: HECTOR
D: Yeah, fuck you!
N: The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase ensues. Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side- swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash can and fall. Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the hood. Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely behind the two kids. Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving off and falls down hard. Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie. Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie burns down the lane beside him. Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight. He's in the clear. Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.
C: STEVIE
D: What the fuck are you doing?
C: RONNIE
D: I was driving in reverse and trying to get you to flip into the back seat.
C: STEVIE
D: What?
C: RONNIE
D: That way I could handcuff you smoothly and take you in. You know, never mind, just get in the goddamn golf cart.
N: Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the golf cart.
S: INT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING
N: Ronnie is in the room with the monitors. The skaters sit across from him. There's a poster on the wall with the security guard motto: OBSERVE AND REPORT. Ronnie fiddles with his walkie-talkie.
C: RONNIE
D: It seems like we go through this every day. What's it going to take for you all to realize that I won't tolerate this horseplay and just do whatever you want to and don't worry about the rules attitude?
C: STEVIE
D: Ronnie, I hear what you're saying and I just want you to know that personally, it pains me to see you all worked up and I just want you to know that I'm really sorry because you can't do shit and you can take your little rules and stick'em up your ass, you fuckin' rent-a-cop.
N: The Skaters all start cracking up.
C: HECTOR
D: Yeah, suck my dick.
N: The Skaters start laughing louder.
C: RONNIE
D: That's funny, guys. I try to be a mentor to the youth, but it seems like you boys have gone straight past boydom to the land of street- hardened criminals. I'm left with no choice. You call me rent-a- cop, but I call myself the law's right hand. I see the crime... and I phone it in. And that's what I'm getting ready to do right now.
N: Ronnie picks up the walkie-talkie and turns it on. He speaks into it.
C: RONNIE
D: 317, this is Ronnie Barnhardt over at Carolina Mall. Come in, over.
E: into walkie
C: WALKIE VOICE
D: This is Officer Douglas, what do you wish to report? Over.
E: V.O.
C: RONNIE
D: I've got a couple of trespassers who have been found skateboarding on mall property. Can you send a black and white over to take these boys into processing? Over.
E: into walkie
N: Ronnie winks at the Skaters.
C: WALKIE VOICE
D: Uh... Yeah, Ronnie, we're kind of busy today. I mean, we got like three car accidents.
E: V.O.
N: Ronnie picks up the walkie and whispers into it.
C: RONNIE
D: What do you mean? I've got these guys red-handed. I'm gonna need a car over here pronto. I can't hold them all day by myself. Over.
E: into walkie
C: WALKIE VOICE
D: Copy. Yeah, like I said, we're awfully busy right now. I think you should probably just make'em promise not to do it again and threaten to call their parents or something. That'll get them. Over.
E: V.O.
N: The Skaters start laughing.
C: RONNIE
D: Sir, I don't think you understand, their parents don't care about them. This is a 911 from one of your soldiers. Officer needs assistance! Over!
E: into walkie
C: WALKIE VOICE
D: Yeah, it's not gonna happen...
E: V.O.
N: The VOICE fades as Ronnie turns off the Walkie.
C: RONNIE
D: So as you can see, the law is just one little call away. But I'm gonna choose not to use that tactic today. I'm gonna do something that I like to do from time to time, and that's called handle shit myself.
N: Ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket. He begins writing.
C: RONNIE
D: While I won't have you arrested today, I am going to suspend each of you for one week. For those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. This is official documentation. If you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. At that point, I call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail.
N: Ronnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table. Stevie looks down at it. He picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at Ronnie. The Skaters start cracking up.
C: RONNIE
D: You accepted it originally, so it still counts.
N: Ronnie sits there while the Skaters laugh.
S: INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
N: Ronnie sits at a table with a Cinnabon in front of him. Across the table sits NELL, a chubby but cute girl, who wears a Cinnabon uniform. The couple holds hands and they have their heads bowed.
C: NELL
D: Dear Lord, bless this food that we eat and purify it with Your salvation. Also, please keep Ronnie safe as he works in Your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of the mall.
E: MORE
C: NELL
D: And please turn your wrath on any sinners that try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of hell. In Christ's name we pray, amen.
E: CONT'D
C: RONNIE
D: Amen.
N: Ronnie begins devouring his Cinnabon.
C: NELL
D: So what's on the agenda for you today?
C: RONNIE
D: You know, the usual. Spot crime before it happens, perform random acts of bravery, save people from certain death, yada yada yada.
C: NELL
D: What's wrong, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: Nothing, Nell.
C: NELL
D: Ronnie, I know that you really want to be a Police Officer, but you have to realize that things work out the way they're meant to.
C: RONNIE
D: I know. I'm okay, Nell. Thanks, but really, I mean, I'm on the front lines right now. I'm livin' it.
C: NELL
D: Your job is definitely more exciting than mine.
C: RONNIE
D: Of course it is, but at least you don't have to wrestle with the demons at night. I better get going.
C: NELL
D: I'll see you after work, sweetie.
N: Nell leans in to kiss Ronnie, but he pulls away.
C: RONNIE
D: Not at work, Nell. We have to keep up appearances, we talked about this. And don't call me sweetie.
C: NELL
D: I'm sorry. I'll see you after work, Officer Barnhardt.
C: RONNIE
D: 'Bye, Nell.
N: Ronnie stands up and walks off.
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning MALL WALKERS as they stride around the outer marked lane. It's all senior citizens.
C: RONNIE
D: Slow it down. Watch your speed there. This ain't a race. Hey, second time, slow it down.
N: Mark, the Mall Manager, walks up to Ronnie.
C: MARK
D: I've been looking all over for you.
C: RONNIE
D: I haven't been hiding, but some things that I have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. Trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up.
C: MARK
D: So you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy Pervert.
C: RONNIE
D: For the love of God.
C: MARK
D: I know, it's horrible.
C: RONNIE
D: You want me to phone this one in to the police?
C: MARK
D: Not just yet. See if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. What I need you to do is watch out for this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly.
C: RONNIE
D: Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I understand you. You're telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and Reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own.
C: MARK
D: I'm just saying keep an eye out and keep quiet.
C: RONNIE
D: So basically, I'm in charge of this whole investigation.
C: MARK
D: There's no investigation.
C: RONNIE
D: Not yet. Okay, Mark, I'll do it, but I'm gonna need a few things first.
C: MARK
D: You can't carry a gun.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, I'm gonna need a new title. Something to instill fear in the criminal mind. How about Director of Mall Intelligence?
C: MARK
D: Head of Mall Security.
C: RONNIE
D: That's perfect.
C: MARK
D: And it doesn't come with a raise.
C: RONNIE
D: Got it.
C: MARK
D: And the new title stays between us.
C: RONNIE
D: Understood. Thank you for this opportunity, Mark. I won't let you down.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CAROLINA MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie stands in front of a Cadillac with a boot on one of his tires. A local news camera crew comes up to Ronnie and the FEMALE REPORTER starts asking questions.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Excuse me, sir, but we would like to ask you a few questions.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm sorry, but I can't answer anything.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: We heard a report that an unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several women. Do you care to comment?
C: RONNIE
D: I'm not allowed to comment on that situation.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: So you admit there is a situation.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm trained to resist torture for up to 72 hours, you really expect me to break now? Get real, lady.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: We're wasting our time here. Let's go find some police to interview.
E: to her camera crew
C: RONNIE
D: Good luck.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: RONNIE
D: It just means you won't find any police.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Are you telling me the police haven't even been called!
C: RONNIE
D: Ewww, alert the media.
E: SARCASTIC
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Jesus, well who'd they leave in charge, you?
N: Ronnie smiles like he knows a secret.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Yeah, right. Why would they leave you in charge?
C: RONNIE
D: First of all, if there was a situation to be handled, I don't see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that I would be in charge.
N: The Reporter waves for her crew to start filming.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Look, there is no way you're in charge of this investigation.
E: setting a trap
C: RONNIE
D: Well for your information, I'm in charge of this whole fucking operation.
E: MORE
C: RONNIE
D: I don't give a goddamn if you believe me or not, Ms. Hot Fuckin' SHIT news lady. I'm the first line of defense against this pervert. As the law's right hand, I'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun. I'm the defender of this war zone. Just me and my goddamn flashlight.
E: CONT'D
N: Just then, SADDAMN, an angry Middle Easterner with shitloads of cell phones and beepers strapped to him, comes running up to Ronnie.
C: SADDAMN
D: You motherfucker, you put a boot on my car!
C: RONNIE
D: I warned you about parking in the fire lane, Saddamn!
E: cop voice
C: SADDAMN
D: Fuck you, Ronnie! Take that goddamn boot off of my car.
C: RONNIE
D: (going into cop
C: VOICE)
D: Step away now!
C: SADDAMN
D: I pay good money to this mall. Don't tell me where to park!
C: RONNIE
D: Sir, I will be forced to take action if you do not step back!
C: SADDAMN
D: I'm gonna kill you!
N: Ronnie pulls out his taser and shoots Saddamn. Saddamn goes down hard and begins twitching. He is fucking out of it! Ronnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing happened.
C: RONNIE
D: As I was saying, the pervert situation here is real bleak. For all you people out there thinking of coming to the mall, please for your own safety, stay away.
C: SADDAMN
D: I can't believe you tased me.
E: still fucked up
C: RONNIE
D: That's right and I've got another one waiting right here for you.
E: to the man
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: BRANDI, the make-up counter girl, globs on tons of make- up. She's a hot girl who looks like she's spent a few sticky nights in the bed of a truck. Ronnie stands back and watches Brandi. Finally, he walks up to her.
C: RONNIE
D: Hey, Brandi.
N: Brandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to applying make-up.
C: RONNIE
D: That color looks great on your skin. Not just that color, but I've noticed that all make-up looks really good on you. Especially the blue around your eyes. I bet it drives the men crazy.
N: Brandi glares at Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: It's okay. I can say that because I'm taken.
C: BRANDI
D: What do you want, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: I'm here on official business. See, I don't know if you know this, but I have recently been made Head of Mall Security. Did you hear about that?
C: BRANDI
D: No.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, I'm sure you will. It's actually pretty huge news. But the reason I stopped by is to tell you that it looks like we've got a pervert on the loose. A real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself. I just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work.
C: BRANDI
D: Okay, got it.
C: RONNIE
D: And you may not want to wear any of those skirts that you like to wear.
C: BRANDI
D: What skirts?
C: RONNIE
D: You know what skirts. Something like that could set him off. And for that matter, you better not wear any of those little low-cut top things either, okay? Especially with those black bras because, you can really see them in the light. Perverts really tend to notice stuff like that. Okay, see you later.
N: Ronnie takes off and leaves Brandi still applying make- up.
S: INT. MALL - NIGHT
N: The lights are turned off and the mall is empty. Ronnie walks out with Dennis.
C: RONNIE
D: Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a minute to talk. There's no easy way to say this so I'm just going to come right out with it. Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security. I know this isn't easy for you to hear seeing as you've been here longer than me. But I want you to know that you're my best friend and I'm only going to accept the job if you're okay with that.
N: Dennis shrugs.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, you should know I've already accepted and it's too late to turn it down now. Every ship needs a captain. So you were passed over. Who gives a shit? Dennis, in time, you'll come to accept answering to me. Remember, there aren't any leaders in friendship. We cool?
N: Dennis and Ronnie shake hands. They walk out and lock the doors behind them.
C: RONNIE
D: Hey, you want to go and grab a beer or something?
N: Dennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car. Ronnie follows.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, you're right. You're probably in no mood to party after that news. Well, try not to take it too hard. See you later, buddy.
N: Ronnie leaves Dennis and walks to his car.
S: EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
N: Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of the shittiest trailer park in town.
S: INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Ronnie lives in a boy's room. There's all kind of posters up with instructions on how to execute choke holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows. However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the mall. Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his MOM across from him. She's an old, thick boozer, with the strength of a father and the love of a mother. She downs a full beer and throws it against the wall.
C: MOM
D: You think you're ready for a shot at the title, motherfucker?!
C: RONNIE
D: I'm ready, Mom.
C: MOM
D: Ding ding.
N: Ronnie and his Mom take to fighting. Ronnie's Mom is surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to Ronnie's cranium.
C: RONNIE
D: Ow!
C: MOM
D: What's wrong, baby? Is your pussy hurting?
C: RONNIE
D: Fuck you!
N: Ronnie attacks his Mom. He manages to scoop her and body slam her to the ground. Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on the ground. However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.
C: MOM
D: Ah!
C: RONNIE
D: You give?
C: MOM
D: Fuck you!
N: Ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter!
C: MOM
D: Ow!
C: RONNIE
D: You move with me, you go down. You move against me and your arm breaks.
C: MOM
D: I give!
C: RONNIE
D: What's that?
C: MOM
D: I give! Let me go, goddamn it.
N: Ronnie lets his Mom go. She shakes off the pain.
C: MOM
D: I can't believe you got that lucky shit on me.
C: RONNIE
D: Luck has nothing to do with it.
C: MOM
D: You almost broke my arm.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm sorry, Mom. Are you okay?
C: MOM
D: Not really.
N: Ronnie's Mom rubs her arm. Ronnie drops his guard and comes over to tend to his Mom's wounds. However, she's only playing possum. Ronnie's Mom sees an opening and attacks Ronnie at his legs. Ronnie goes down and the two start wrestling again. (NOTE: This plays as realistic as possible, no phony punches or smooth/comedy fighting, it looks like a school yard fight video. Sloppy and real.)
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Ronnie is laying in bed while his Mom chugs another beer beside him. She's one-eye-closed punch-me-in-the-face drunk. They're watching Ronnie on the news from earlier. EDITED LOCAL NEWS SEGMENT: Ronnie talks into microphone.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, well for your information, I'm in charge of this whole BEEP operation. I don't give a BEEP if you believe me or not, Ms. Hot BEEP BEEP news lady. Do you see anybody else? BEEP no you don't. As the law's right hand, I'm the first line of defense against this pervert. I'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun. I'm the defender of this war zone. Just me and my BEEP flashlight.
E: V.O.
N: The FEMALE REPORTER addresses the camera over FOOTAGE OF RONNIE TASING SADDAMN.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: No comment as to why steps are not being taken, but this Security Guard feels like he is the only one doing anything to protect the people who visit Carolina Mall from the suspect. For all of us, I hope this isn't the case. Back to you, Lindsay.
E: V.O.
N: Ronnie turns off the television.
C: MOM
D: I'm so proud of you, Ronnie.
E: drunken slur
C: RONNIE
D: Do you think I did good?
C: MOM
D: Hell yes. You were great.
C: RONNIE
D: Ah, you're just drunk.
C: MOM
D: Nah, you did good.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I usually don't come out to the forefront like that.
E: MORE
C: RONNIE
D: My official orders are Observe and Report, but when Mark put me in charge of mall security, something inside of me changed. It's what I've always wanted. Things haven't always worked out, with the whole... well, you know. But this gives me faith that I can do something great. This is my call to duty and I'm going to answer. I'm going to bust this fucking pervert. I swear it on everything I am. Anyway, I better get to sleep. I got a big day tomorrow. Good night, Mom. Mom?
E: CONT'D off no answer
N: On cue, Ronnie's Mom falls over in a drunken sleep. She starts SNORING loud as hell. Ronnie gets out of the covers and helps his Mom onto the bed. Ronnie tucks her in like a loving son. He pries the bottle from her fingers. Then, he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on the floor.
S: INT. MALL - O'CHARLEY'S - DAY
N: Ronnie walks up to O'Charley's. It's the one-step-up restaurant that's in the mall. There's a BOUNCER out front who watches over the store.
C: RONNIE
D: You working the door here?
C: BOUNCER
D: That's what they tell me. They needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever.
C: RONNIE
D: Kind of funny they thought they needed more security here. Ha. You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation.
C: BOUNCER
D: I work for O'Charley's, not for the mall.
C: RONNIE
D: Granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of Carolina Mall?
C: BOUNCER
D: You know, I thought about getting a job as a Mall Security.
C: RONNIE
D: You did?
C: BOUNCER
D: Yeah, man. I mean, I'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it's just like, I don't want to do shit, you know what I mean? My parents said I have to work if I want to live at home, but I just don't feel like doing anything. This was the easiest job I could find, I mean, what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant? But now that I think about it, Mall Security could be easier than this.
C: RONNIE
D: My young friend, you are sorely mistaken. Do you know how much stuff I'm in charge of?
C: BOUNCER
D: No.
C: RONNIE
D: A shitload. That's not even counting the parking lot.
C: BOUNCER
D: Really? I thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police.
C: RONNIE
D: No way, that's about like 75, maybe 82 percent of it. There's so much other stuff.
C: BOUNCER
D: Like what?
C: RONNIE
D: Two words, Friday Night.
C: BOUNCER
D: What about it?
C: RONNIE
D: It's crazy, let's just leave it at that.
C: BOUNCER
D: Okay.
C: RONNIE
D: Listen. I like you, but I don't like the fact that you're masquerading as an official in the security world. If you're serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps I could look into getting you a job on my staff?
C: BOUNCER
D: Oh yeah?
C: RONNIE
D: Part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself. It's who I am.
C: BOUNCER
D: Does it pay more than $6.50 an hour?
N: Ronnie laughs. He leans over to the Bouncer and whispers in his ear.
C: BOUNCER
D: Seven even.
E: WHISPERING
N: Ronnie stands back and winks at the Bouncer.
C: BOUNCER
D: I'd say that's more than I'm making now.
C: RONNIE
D: Hold on, this job involves a probationary period. You have to prove yourself worthy. We can't just hire any old Tom, Dick, or Harry just because they want to carry a flashlight.
C: BOUNCER
D: What do I have to do?
C: RONNIE
D: You have to complete a term as deputy. You will answer directly to me. Your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble. If this works out, then I will phone the crime into the police. Now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity. Once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself.
C: BOUNCER
D: So basically, I just do what I'm doing now and then you'll get me a job?
C: RONNIE
D: For starters.
C: BOUNCER
D: How long does this mentorship last?
C: RONNIE
D: Until Mark lets me hire another guy.
C: BOUNCER
D: Can I smoke while I work?
C: RONNIE
D: Yes, you can.
C: BOUNCER
D: Sign me up.
C: RONNIE
D: You keep that attitude up and you'll have no problem making the squad.
N: Ronnie reaches into his pocket and hands the Bouncer a mini flashlight.
C: BOUNCER
D: What's this?
C: RONNIE
D: It's a flashlight. Get to know it. It's your new best friend. Until you get your giant flashlight. Then, that will be your new best friend.
N: The Bouncer takes it and puts it into his shirt pocket.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, look alive, soldier. Deputy time starts now. No more slacker attitude for you.
N: Ronnie walks away, but after he takes a few steps, he stops and turns.
C: RONNIE
D: You know, I remember when I got my first flashlight...
N: Ronnie goes into an emotional memory in his mind. Ronnie walks away leaving the Bouncer there alone.
S: EXT. MALL - DAY
N: LOUD ROCK SCORE FADES TO LOUD ROCK SOURCE. A tricked-out Toyota pulls up to the parking lot. The car comes to a stop and out steps Brandi, the makeup counter girl. Brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day. As she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door, the Pervert pops out. This time, he's upped his attack and beats off staring right at her. The horrendous sight stops Brandi dead in her tracks. She SCREAMS bloody murder...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: It looks like a RAPE SCENE. Brandi cries in the makeup chair and is surrounded by a large group of mall employees. Her makeup runs down her face as her effeminate coworker BRUCE consoles her. Mark is working crowd control.
C: MARK
D: Alright, people, she's doing good. We're just gonna get her down to my office and everything's going to be fine, so the best thing for you employees to do is just get on back to your stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school savings here at Carolina Mall.
E: to the crowd
C: BRANDI
D: It was horrible! Oh, my God, the thought of that disgusting -- I think I'm going to be sick.
C: BRUCE
D: Just let it out, baby. He should be ashamed!
C: BRANDI
D: I just keep playing it over and over again in my head.
C: MARK
D: Brandi, please, Dennis has called the police and let's just take this down to my office.
N: The DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER comes running over.
C: DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER
D: What's going on?
C: BRUCE
D: A Pervert attacked Brandi is what's going on!
C: DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER
D: Are you okay, Brandi?
C: BRANDI
D: Physically, yes. But psychologically, no!
N: Brandi starts crying hard. The Department Store Manager pulls Mark aside.
C: DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER
D: Did you call the cops?
E: WHISPERING
C: MARK
D: They're on the way.
N: Brandi starts crying even louder.
C: DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER
D: Yeah, we got to get her the fuck out of here. Everybody's standing around and nobody's shopping. This is bad for business.
C: MARK
D: I'm trying, but she just keeps crying.
N: Ronnie comes running up on the scene. He looks like a man who ran a mile to get here.
C: RONNIE
D: Brandi! I came as soon as I heard. Jesus, are you alright?
C: BRANDI
D: I'm fine, Ronnie.
C: MARK
D: She's fine, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: This is one of the most heinous things I've seen. Jesus, I tried to tell you about the skirts. It's not your fault, you little fighter you. Ronnie's not mad, okay?
C: MARK
D: Ronnie, can you get her down to my office so the Police can talk to her in private when they arrive.
C: RONNIE
D: Rogers.
C: BRANDI
D: I can't walk right now. I feel like I'm in shock.
C: RONNIE
D: Don't worry. I'll carry you.
N: Ronnie reaches down and picks up Brandi. She totally lets him. Ronnie struggles and can't lift her. It looks dumb.
C: MARK
D: Oh, fucking Jesus.
N: Ronnie finally manages to lift Brandi. He carries her out of the Department Store and down through the middle of the mall.
S: EXT. MALL - DAY
N: A black UNMARKED POLICE CAR pulls up quickly and stops directly in front of the Main Entrance to the mall as if to say to the world, "I'm a Cop and I can do this." Out steps DETECTIVE HARRISON, a young cop that has the arrogance and swagger of a man who is just beginning to feel his power.
S: INT. MALL MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Mark sits at his desk, while Ronnie comforts a crying Brandi. Dennis stands in the corner, not saying a word. Detective Harrison knocks as he comes in the door.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Your secretary told me to come on in. I'm Detective Harrison, Cabarrus County Police.
N: Detective Harrison shows his badge to Mark. The two men shake.
C: MARK
D: Mark Talbert, I manage the mall. This is Brandi, she's the one who saw the deviant.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Hello, Brandi. Are you doing okay?
C: BRANDI
D: I'm really shaken up.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Yes, ma'am, I'm sure you are after all you've been through, but I'm here to tell you that we're going to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this.
C: RONNIE
D: My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief inspector on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is my lieutenant, Dennis. From one law enforcement officer to another, I just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to bring this assailant to justice.
N: The Detective pauses as if he's unsure what just happened.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Great. Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look at the suspect?
E: back to Brandi
C: BRANDI
D: Yes, I did.
C: RONNIE
D: Did you get a blood sample?
C: BRANDI
D: No.
C: RONNIE
D: That's a shame. Would have been useful.
C: MARK
D: Go ahead, Detective.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Thank you. Brandi, can you remember anything specifically? What color was his hair? Was he tall or short?
C: BRANDI
D: He was tall and skinny and he had brown hair and it was real greasy.
N: Detective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as Brandi speaks. Ronnie notices this and picks up some paper and begins to write as well.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Was his hair long or short?
C: BRANDI
D: It was long about to his shoulders.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Did he say anything?
C: BRANDI
D: No, he just stood there and you know, touched himself.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: What was he wearing?
C: BRANDI
D: Just a brown trench coat.
C: RONNIE
D: This is what I got so far.
N: Ronnie holds up his paper. Ronnie has drawn a crude sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described, but it's basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis.
C: RONNIE
D: What's yours look like?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I just wrote a description.
C: RONNIE
D: Oh.
N: Ronnie puts his sketch away.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Okay, Brandi, I think that's good for now. I think the best thing at this point is to just follow up with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they remember anything.
C: BRANDI
D: What if he comes back?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That's highly unlikely. These incidents are usually random and unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be safe.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Detective. By my math, it seems pretty clear that Brandi's been targeted.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Targeted? What gives you that impression?
C: RONNIE
D: Well, how about the fact that she was the first employee to get assaulted? Not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall. To me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering Brandi.
C: BRANDI
D: Is that going to happen?!
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That's not going to happen.
N: Ronnie looks at Brandi and nods his head "yes."
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Well don't worry. I'm on the case and I'm going to do everything in my power to bring this guy down.
C: RONNIE
D: That's right, Brandi, you've got the best team in law enforcement working for you.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Look, I've got to get going. Here's my card. I'll even write my home phone number on the back, just in the event you need to get a hold of me.
N: Detective Harrison writes his number on the back and then hands his card to Brandi.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Give me a call when you aren't working and I'll have you come to the station to look through some mug shots. Don't worry okay.
E: touches her leg
C: BRANDI
D: I feel a lot better now.
N: Ronnie holds out his hand.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: What?
C: RONNIE
D: I'll take one of those cards as well.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Oh, okay.
N: Detective Harrison reluctantly hands Ronnie a card.
C: RONNIE
D: Go ahead and write your home phone on there as well in case I need to get a hold of you.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: You can just leave a message at the station. I check my messages constantly.
C: RONNIE
D: Sorry, but I'm gonna need those digits. If we're gonna solve this crime we need to constantly be in communication with each other and have an open door policy with intelligence. Brandi, let me see that card.
N: Ronnie takes the car from Brandi and copies the home phone number from the back.
C: RONNIE
D: Cool, I'll call you later with an update.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Don't do that.
C: RONNIE
D: It's no problem at all. We're brothers of the badge. This is what we do for each other.
N: Detective Harrison takes off. Ronnie looks around happily.
C: RONNIE
D: Seems like a good guy. A little green, but still solid.
S: INT. MALL - NIGHT
N: The mall is winding down for the day and most of the customers have gone home. Ronnie walks through the mall, taping up pictures of the sketch he made of the Pervert. Nell comes walking up with her apron over her shoulder.
C: NELL
D: What are you doing?
C: RONNIE
D: Just putting these posters up.
C: NELL
D: You've been so obsessed with catching this pervert I've barely seen you.
C: RONNIE
D: That's what it's like when you date the Head of Mall Security. The downside is we don't get to see each other as much, but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends.
C: NELL
D: Well, are you ready to go?
C: RONNIE
D: Sure, let's take off.
S: INT. RONNIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The LOCAL NEWS is on and they show an update on the MALL FLASHER STORY. The sound is OFF. The living room is dark. Ronnie and Nell are on the couch making out. Ronnie is starting to get frisky. His hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt. She allows it. Ronnie decides to push it. He takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt. Nell immediately stops kissing and pushes Ronnie away.
C: NELL
D: What are you doing, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: Come on, let me get some of those big bazoombas.
N: Ronnie goes in hard for the tits, but Nell pushes him away.
C: NELL
D: Ronnie, no.
C: RONNIE
D: Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do it?
C: NELL
D: You know we talked about this.
C: RONNIE
D: We did, it's just, well, I'm tired of just doing what we do. I'm ready for something bigger. Like sex or just maybe using a finger on you --
C: NELL
D: Ronnie, you know I'm saving myself for marriage. I thought you were okay with that.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, I used to be, it's just. I don't know. What's so great about being a 27-year-old virgin?
N: Nell stands up and starts to put on her coat. Ronnie stands up and tries to comfort her.
C: RONNIE
D: Nell, I'm sorry. Don't go away like this.
C: NELL
D: I thought you loved my purity.
C: RONNIE
D: I do. I really do. I'm sorry, Nell.
C: NELL
D: It's okay. I should leave anyway, it's late.
C: RONNIE
D: I'll stop by for breakfast tomorrow.
C: NELL
D: See ya tomorrow.
N: Nell leaves and Ronnie closes the door behind her.
C: RONNIE
D: Mom, wake up. Let's go to bed.
N: Ronnie's mom groans. She has been passed out on the floor with an empty bottle of Jack D beside her the whole time.
S: INT. MALL - NIGHT
N: The lights are off and a gloved hand breaks into a case in the jewelry store. All of the diamonds and gold are picked up and pocketed. Someone is robbing this bitch.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - THE NEXT MORNING
N: Ronnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning coffee. He stops when he sees that the jewelry store has been broken into and robbed.
C: RONNIE
D: Oh shit.
N: Ronnie goes running down through the mall.
S: INT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING
N: Dennis and Ronnie are sitting and Mark stands over them. They're looking at the security tapes. Detective Harrison knocks on the door and walks in. Ronnie stands up to greet him.
C: RONNIE
D: Good to see you, brother. Looks like the old team is getting together to crack one more case.
N: Ronnie gives Detective Harrison a hug.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm ready to go to war with you.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Thanks for waking me up this morning, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: I've already checked the Security tapes. They didn't catch a thing. Someone must have broken in here and turned them off.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry. I've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. The suspect was probably wearing gloves.
C: MARK
D: That doesn't sound good. How did they do it?
C: RONNIE
D: Laser technology.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: My guess it was an inside job. Probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard.
C: RONNIE
D: Detective Harrison, can I ask you how long you've been a detective for?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I'm almost at the end of my first year.
C: RONNIE
D: Just as I thought, a rookie.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I've been a police officer for several years.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, you're a rookie, okay. It's fine, you'll learn with experience. And when you do, you'll discover that rule #1 of law enforcement is that you don't ever turn on a fellow officer. Now, I know you would never actually accuse somebody on my Security Force of committing this act of lawlessness.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Whoever did this would have to had keys to the Security Room so they could shut off the camera.
C: RONNIE
D: Look, my record speaks for itself and as for Dennis, well I can certainly vouch for him. Dennis is one of the finest men I know, so just take my word, you're barking up the wrong tree. Now, let's put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, nobody is accusing anybody, but I would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees.
C: MARK
D: Okay, but all I ask is that you do it quietly, so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I understand.
C: RONNIE
D: I understand too, sir.
C: MARK
D: Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation.
C: RONNIE
D: No can do, Mark. When you appointed me Head of Mall Security, I swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees.
C: MARK
D: You didn't swear an oath.
C: RONNIE
D: To myself I did.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, on these types of investigations, it's usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen.
C: RONNIE
D: There's only one cook. I'm a chef. A cook and chef, together, serving up justice.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I'm gonna do this alone.
C: RONNIE
D: Hot plates of justice.
N: Ronnie stands up.
C: RONNIE
D: Come on, rookie. Let me show you the lay of the land.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie talks to Dennis in the middle of the mall.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, Dennis. I've gotta hang with Detective Harrison.
E: MORE
C: RONNIE
D: What I need for you to understand is that just because Detective Harrison is here, doesn't mean that you and me are no longer best friends. Sure, Harrison would be cool to hang out with. He carries a badge and a gun. He probably owns a boat. Over time, we'll probably become really close like brothers, but for right now, you're still number one. Now, I must leave you behind because duty calls, so... chin up. Radio if you need anything.
E: CONT'D
N: Ronnie takes off, but we STAY WITH Dennis. He walks directly to the ARCADE. Dennis puts a quarter in the machine and plays pinball.
S: INT. MALL - KIOSK - DAY
N: Ronnie watches from afar as Detective Harrison interviews SADDAMN, who stands in front of his cell phone kiosk.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: So, have you seen any suspicious people hanging around the mall? Anybody who might have been casing the stores?
C: SADDAMN
D: Nah, man. I ain't seen nothing.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Okay, well if you can think of anything, here's my card.
N: Detective Harrison hands Saddamn his card and begins to leave. Disgusted, Ronnie comes walking up.
C: RONNIE
D: My turn, Rookie.
E: to Harrison
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: What are you doing, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: Solving the whole case right before your eyes.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, this is official police business.
C: RONNIE
D: Hello, Saddamn.
C: SADDAMN
D: What the fuck you want, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: I want your ass to face the music is what I want.
C: SADDAMN
D: Don't come any further, bitch. The restraining order says 20 feet so just back the fuck up.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but just let me handle this. Have a good day, sir.
E: to Saddamn
C: RONNIE
D: So you're just gonna let him slip right through your fingers?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I have no reason to make him a suspect.
C: RONNIE
D: No reason? Look at him. There's every reason in the goddamn book.
C: SADDAMN
D: Why are you saying that, man?
C: RONNIE
D: I think it's obvious, Saddamn.
C: SADDAMN
D: That's fucked up. You're racist, man.
C: RONNIE
D: You're not even black.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, stop. We're finished here. Now if you're going to tag along, I'm gonna need you to just stay back; are we clear?
C: RONNIE
D: Sure, sorry. We're crystal.
N: Detective Harrison walks away. Ronnie follows, but takes one more look at Saddamn, who flips Ronnie off. Saddamn goes back to hollering at girls.
C: SADDAMN
D: What's up, girl, you got a boyfriend? Free cell phones with a month trial and I throw in my phone number for free.
S: INT. MALL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY
N: Ronnie stands nearby as Detective Harrison questions an old Mexican JANITOR, who stands by his cart of cleaning products.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Did you let anybody borrow your keys?
C: JANITOR
D: No, senor.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Have you seen anything suspicious?
C: JANITOR
D: No, senor.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Okay, sir. Thank you for your time.
C: RONNIE
D: Alright, I believe I can be of some assistance here.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, we talked about this.
C: RONNIE
D: This is a special circumstance.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: What special circumstance?
C: RONNIE
D: Communication skills, watch and learn.
N: Ronnie steps into the forefront.
C: RONNIE
D: Que pasa?
C: JANITOR
D: Long drawn out conversation in Spanish?
C: RONNIE
D: Como?
C: JANITOR
D: More Spanish dialogue.
C: RONNIE
D: Si. Yeah, this guy definitely did it.
E: to Harrison
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: What did he say?
C: RONNIE
D: I don't know, I don't speak Spanish, but judging from his tonal inflections, it's safe to say that he's hiding something. The only question is where. Okay, Ramon, I'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean. Or else Detective Harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to Mexico.
E: to Janitor
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: No, I'm not.
C: RONNIE
D: Good cop, bad cop, just play along. Where are you hiding the jewels?
E: to Ramon
C: JANITOR
D: No se.
C: RONNIE
D: Alright, you're gonna make me be the bad guy here? Well, that's a role I'm comfortable playing. Let's just see what you're hiding.
N: Ronnie digs through the trash bin that is on the cart. Ronnie slings trash out all over the floor. He finds nothing.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, that's enough.
C: RONNIE
D: Think you're pretty slick, don't you? Guess what? I'm pretty slick too.
N: Ronnie takes the cleaning products and opens the bottles. He pours the contents out on the floor. What's he looking for? Who knows.
C: RONNIE
D: Alright, you're free -- Wait a minute.
N: Ronnie takes the mop and breaks it in half with his foot. He takes the halves and shakes them, thinking that something will come pouring out of the open cylinders. Nothing does.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, my mistake. Sir, you're free to go. Uh, you might want to have someone clean this up which in this case is you, so, uh, chop- chop. Wouldn't want anyone to slip on this mess.
N: Ronnie leaves the Janitor with a bewildered look.
S: INT. MALL - VICTORIA SECRETS - DAY
N: Ronnie follows Detective Harrison into the lingerie store. They approach the counter where a HOT CLERK is working the register.
C: HOT CLERK
D: Hello, can I help you?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I'm Detective Harrison with the Cabarrus County Police.
C: RONNIE
D: And I'm Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall Security.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Okay, seriously, would you back the fuck off?! I'm trying to do my job and you're fucking it up.
C: RONNIE
D: Come on, we're working here.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I'm working!
N: Detective Harrison is seriously annoyed.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Sorry. Hi. I'm doing a check with all the mall employees to see if anybody has any information on the robbery that took place here last night?
E: back to the Clerk
C: HOT CLERK
D: I'm sorry, but I haven't noticed anything out of ordinary.
N: A SEXY WORKER comes up to them holding a scandalous pair of undies.
C: SEXY WORKER
D: Tracy, do you think my boyfriend would like these?
N: The Sexy Worker holds the undies up to her crotch. Ronnie looks and his tongue almost drops out of his mouth. He straightens himself out.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That's fine, thanks for the help.
C: RONNIE
D: You're gonna let them distract you with a little bit of panty showing. You have got a lot to learn, my friend. Who are you protecting, toots?
E: to the Hot Clerk
C: HOT CLERK
D: What are you talking about?
C: RONNIE
D: Look, I'm sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here. It's probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty, but I'm not most men. I can see through the sexuality to the truth. Jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't really expect me to think that a man wants that crap. I'm putting you on my list of top suspects. I don't think you did the crime, but I do think you are an accomplice.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I'm sorry, ma'am. He's not with me. Here's my card. If you think of anything, just give me a call.
N: Detective Harrison walks out and Ronnie follows him. On the way out of the store, Ronnie passes a MAN who is looking at the underwear. Ronnie stops.
C: RONNIE
D: You should be ashamed of yourself.
N: Ronnie gives him a warning look, then walks out.
S: INT. MALL - HOT TOPIC - DAY
N: Ronnie and Detective Harrison stand across the counter from a tattooed SALESMAN.
C: RONNIE
D: Is that pot I smell?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Shut up, Ronnie!
C: SALESMAN
D: It's sage.
C: RONNIE
D: Whatever, hippy. If I find you doing drugs or killing cats or whatever you devil worshippers do, I'll come back here and bust you. I swear to God.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Get the hell out, Ronnie. I'm here to ask questions about the robbery.
C: RONNIE
D: Just forget that, we're on to something bigger here. (back to the
C: SALESMAN)
D: Tell me more about this 'sage.'
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - SEARS - DAY
N: Ronnie and Detective Harrison are in the hardware department talking to the SEARS MANAGER. Detective Harrison sits on the ground. He has completely given up on the investigation at this point, as Ronnie controls it all. Ronnie picks up a hammer.
C: RONNIE
D: Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm the smartest man alive, but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case in, oh say, a jewelry store.
C: SEARS MANAGER
D: Couldn't you smash the glass with anything?
C: RONNIE
D: You really think you're gonna talk your way out of this one?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
N: Ronnie is hanging out with Dennis and the Bouncer from O'Charley's. Behind him, Nell works the counter at Cinnabon.
C: RONNIE
D: You guys should have been there today. We were just solving shit left and right. I mean, that's what this job is supposed to be like. Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing cases is where it's at. It's rewarding too because at the end of the day, you know you've done something good for the world.
C: BOUNCER
D: What are we doing here, Ronnie? I thought you said they were giving away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches.
C: RONNIE
D: Well -- What is your name anyway?
C: BOUNCER
D: Charles.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, my young apprentice. I called you here today because as Head of Mall Security, I have decided that it's time to take protection to the next level. In other words, I alone cannot combat this recent crime wave. In order to help me in my personal journey, I have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers. So, for now on, Dennis, my right-hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall. Little Chucky, you will be on the case of the Pervert. You are both to collect data and provide it to me. I will analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies.
C: BOUNCER
D: Since we're going to be doing a lot of the work and you're going to be solving the crimes, do we at least get paid?
C: RONNIE
D: You can't measure honor in dollars and cents.
N: Ronnie looks over at the Cinnabon and Nell waves to him. Ronnie smiles back and waves at Nell.
C: BOUNCER
D: Is that your girlfriend or something, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: Who me? Nah, man. Why? What do you think of her?
C: BOUNCER
D: She's not my type, but that's just me.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, but, you don't think she's kind of hot?
C: BOUNCER
D: Are you blind? Give me a break. Wait, are you sure she's not your girlfriend?
C: RONNIE
D: Fuck no. There's no way I'd date that... person who's obviously not hot.
N: Nell waves again, but Ronnie just kind of turns away, ignoring her.
C: RONNIE
D: Anyway, our new unit will operate under the name, 'Special Elite Task Force.' You will answer directly to me and no one else. Now, let's all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying cheer.
N: Ronnie puts his hand out. Dennis puts his in as well. Charles isn't sure.
C: BOUNCER
D: You're gonna hook me up with a job, right?
C: RONNIE
D: Seven even. I promise.
N: Charles puts his hand in as well.
C: RONNIE
D: One, two, three, TASK FORCE!
N: Ronnie is the only one who gets into it. It's a weak-ass cheer.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, so now I say we all take a celebratory trip to Sears because, as we all know, today is half- price day on all automotive parts for mall employees.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: SLOW MOTION BAD-ASS SHOT. The "Elite Task Force" walks down the mall as if they were the baddest ass-kicking team on the planet. They walk united and unopposed.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the robbery "suspects" on a bulletin board. It's pictures of Saddamn and the Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a sketch of the Pervert. The images are on the bottom points of a Pyramid. On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. The whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea is that he defeats them all. Ronnie sits back in his chair and stares at the board. All of a sudden, there is a KNOCK at the door. The door opens and BRANDI peeps her head in.
C: BRANDI
D: Sorry to interrupt.
C: RONNIE
D: It's no interruption. What are you still doing here?
C: BRANDI
D: I had to do inventory tonight. Bruce took off early so I'm the last one. Hey, I was wondering if you would mind walking me to my car. You know, just in case that freak with the dick is out there someplace.
C: RONNIE
D: It would be my honor.
N: Ronnie stands up and walks out with Brandi, shutting off the light as he leaves.
S: EXT. MALL - NIGHT
N: Ronnie and Brandi pull up to Brandi's car in the golf cart.
C: BRANDI
D: Alright, thanks for the ride.
C: RONNIE
D: Just doing my job with a little something extra especially for you.
C: BRANDI
D: See ya tomorrow.
C: RONNIE
D: Brandi, um... I was just thinking, would you like to go to dinner this weekend?
C: BRANDI
D: How come every time somebody does something nice for me, they act like I owe them a blow job?
C: RONNIE
D: Look, it's not like that. I've got a girlfriend... who doesn't work in this mall.
C: BRANDI
D: Ronnie, I got to be honest with you, you're not really my type.
C: RONNIE
D: Just out of curiosity, what is your type?
C: BRANDI
D: Rich guys. Or guys who are really hot.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I guess that's not me.
C: BRANDI
D: I'll go out to dinner with you on one condition.
C: RONNIE
D: What's that?
C: BRANDI
D: This is not a date. Do you understand? We're going to dinner, but we are not going on a date.
C: RONNIE
D: Done.
C: BRANDI
D: And you can never tell anybody we went out.
C: RONNIE
D: My lips are sealed.
C: BRANDI
D: You pay for dinner, right? And as many drinks as I want.
C: RONNIE
D: You may drink your fill.
C: BRANDI
D: And you have to drive me to my car every night after work for the next six months.
C: RONNIE
D: You got it.
C: BRANDI
D: And my car is low on gas, so I need some money to fill it up.
N: Ronnie takes out his wallet.
C: RONNIE
D: Is $20 enough?
C: BRANDI
D: Nah, fifty.
N: Ronnie takes out more money and hands it to Brandi. She takes it, counts it, and puts it into her bra.
C: BRANDI
D: Okay, you can pick me up after work on Saturday. Dinner and that's it. Don't try to kiss me because I'll smack the shit out of you. It's not a date.
C: RONNIE
D: Got it. Not a date.
C: BRANDI
D: Thanks for the ride.
N: Brandi climbs out of the golf cart and walks to her car. She opens the door and starts to get in --
C: RONNIE
D: Hey, Brandi.
C: BRANDI
D: What?
C: RONNIE
D: I lied. It is a date.
N: Before she can argue, Ronnie guns the golf cart and drives away.
S: EXT. MALL - MORNING
N: Ronnie sees Stevie and the Skaters doing hand rails down a ramp while mall patrons try to get by without getting nailed by flying skateboards. Ronnie drives up on his golf cart.
C: STEVIE
D: Our suspension is over.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm not here for that. I need to talk to you.
N: A giant BODYGUARD with a shaved head stands up.
C: BODYGUARD
D: Anything you want to say to Stevie, you can say to me, motherfucker!
C: RONNIE
D: Who the fuck are you?
C: STEVIE
D: This is my cousin, Roy. He's a boxer.
C: BODYGUARD
D: You got a fuckin' problem, bitch?!
N: Ronnie reaches into his belt and produces a can of mace. He sprays it into the eyes of the Bodyguard. The guy goes down and starts SCREAMING IN PAIN.
C: BODYGUARD
D: My eyes!
C: STEVIE
D: Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are you doing?
C: RONNIE
D: I need a favor.
C: STEVIE
D: I'm listening.
C: RONNIE
D: As you know, we've had a lot of crime around here lately. Between the Flasher and all the break-ins, I've decided to go to the streets. Frankly, I'm looking for a stool pigeon and you're just the right person.
C: STEVIE
D: Why would I want to help you?
C: RONNIE
D: I could make it worth your while. You like skating at the mall. I could allow you to skate here whenever you wanted. In exchange, you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators.
C: STEVIE
D: Sorry, dude, but I'm no snitch. Go find somebody else to do your dirty work.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, let me put it another way. If you don't help me, I'm gonna spread your little butt cheeks and stick this flashlight up your ass. But like for real. Like I really will do that. This is the new me talking and I get what I need, you understand me, Stevie?
C: STEVIE
D: Alright, dude, I understand, you sick fuck.
C: RONNIE
D: Cool. In that case, have fun shreadin'.
N: Ronnie gets into his Golf Cart and drives off. Stevie looks down at the Boxer who is still on the ground.
C: STEVIE
D: Stop crying, Roy.
N: Stevie starts skating.
S: INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
N: Ronnie walks into the Food Court and sees Nell waiting at their table with Ronnie's morning Cinnabon. He takes a deep breath and heads over.
C: NELL
D: Hey, sweetie -- Oh, I'm sorry, good morning, Officer Barnhardt.
C: RONNIE
D: Good morning, Nell.
C: NELL
D: Where were you last night? I tried to call, but your mom said you weren't home from work yet.
C: RONNIE
D: Look, I got to talk to you about something. I'm not really sure how to put this. Let's see. If you drove a Toyota.
C: NELL
D: I drive a Ford.
C: RONNIE
D: I know, but let's just pretend you drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota runs really good. It always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you don't have to do much to maintain it. Then you get a really important job like Astronaut, no that won't work, you get a job as the head of Wall Street. Well, you may really like that Toyota, but you're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day, right? Now let's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari. It may be more expensive and harder to drive, but I mean, it just looks good as hell. What would you do?
C: NELL
D: I don't get it.
C: RONNIE
D: You would trade up, Nell. Well, that's exactly what I'm doing.
C: NELL
D: Are you thinking about getting a new car?
C: RONNIE
D: No, Nell, I'm getting a new girlfriend.
C: NELL
D: What?! Who?
C: RONNIE
D: This girl, Brandi.
C: NELL
D: The slutty girl who works at the make-up counter?
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I mean, no, she's not a slut. But you're thinking of the right person.
C: NELL
D: How could you do this to me?
C: RONNIE
D: I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt you. It's just, well, I believe in this world, you play the hand you're dealt and at this point in my life, I've been dealt five Aces. I'd be a fool not to bet.
C: NELL
D: Why are you doing this, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: I have to, Nell.
C: NELL
D: Don't you love me?
C: RONNIE
D: Of course I love you.
C: NELL
D: Then tell me why?
C: RONNIE
D: Because I've never dated the prom queen before.
C: NELL
D: Remember when you started this job? You weren't such a hotshot then. I've stood by you when you were at your worst. Every time you fell, I held your hand and told you everything would be okay. Time and time again.
C: RONNIE
D: Come on. Why do you have to bring that up?
C: NELL
D: I never cared about who you wanted to be, I fell in love with who you really are. If you leave me, Ronnie, I won't be there to pick you up when you fall.
C: RONNIE
D: Even if I do fall, it won't matter, because I'm learning to fly.
N: Ronnie stands up and walks away. Nell sits there sad. She looks down at her Cinnabon and devours the whole thing.
S: INT. MALL - MAURICE'S FOR MEN - DAY
N: Ronnie looks through a clothing rack. It's full of cheap fabrics, lots of imitation silks and shit. A SLICK SALESMAN approaches Ronnie.
C: SLICK SALESMAN
D: Can I help you, sir?
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, um, I've got a really special date tonight with a hot young lady -- Do you know Brandi?
C: SLICK SALESMAN
D: No.
C: RONNIE
D: Never mind. Anyway, I need something that's really 'cool.' Something that will impress her and I guess you could say I'm not exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these days.
C: SLICK SALESMAN
D: Let's see. Are you looking to fall in love or are you looking to get laid?
C: RONNIE
D: Um, I guess love, but uh...
C: SLICK SALESMAN
D: You want to get laid, too?
C: RONNIE
D: Watch it, man. She's a lady. But yes.
C: SLICK SALESMAN
D: Alright, I got just the thing. Something classy is what you want. Show her you're a man with taste.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Ronnie's Mom sits on his bed with a bottle of Wild Turkey. She waits for Ronnie to come out of the closet.
C: MOM
D: Come on, Ronnie, just get out here.
C: RONNIE
D: It's too tight in the butt.
C: MOM
D: Let me see.
N: Ronnie comes out of the closet and he's wearing a ridiculous fucking outfit. It's an imitation silk button up, with a pair of black parachute pants. There's two belts for some DOUBLE BELT action. He's got no socks on and a pair of white shoes. He looks like a goddamn fool.
C: MOM
D: Ronnie, you look so handsome!
C: RONNIE
D: Really, you don't think I look like a phony.
C: MOM
D: Hell no. You look like a stud muffin.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I guess these clothes are kind of cool.
C: MOM
D: Nell is a lucky girl.
C: RONNIE
D: Its not Nell, Mom.
C: MOM
D: Really, I thought you and Nell were going to get married some day.
C: RONNIE
D: I did too. But then I met this girl Brandi and she swept me off my feet.
C: MOM
D: Well, I always liked Nell, but as long as you're happy, Ronnie, that's all I care about.
C: RONNIE
D: I actually feel kind of bad about Nell, but I figure that I can pour all the sadness into Brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell.
C: MOM
D: That sounds wonderful. Is she pretty?
C: RONNIE
D: She is, Mom. She's the most perfect girl in the whole world.
C: MOM
D: I remember when your father picked me up for our first date. I swear he was the most handsome man that I had ever laid eyes on. I knew right then and there that this would be the man that I married.
C: RONNIE
D: I hope that happens tonight.
C: MOM
D: It will, Ronnie. Then you'll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me.
N: Ronnie's Mom holds up her finger for Ronnie. It's a giant yellow/cottony-looking diamond ring.
C: RONNIE
D: Is that a yellow diamond?
C: MOM
D: It's a glass diamond. This is how it looks now.
C: RONNIE
D: Mom, why did Dad leave?
C: MOM
D: Well, he kind of freaked out when you were born. You had so many special needs that he just couldn't handle the pressure. One day, he just couldn't take it anymore.
C: RONNIE
D: Do you think it was my fault that Dad left?
C: MOM
D: Definitely. You don't think it was mine do you?
C: RONNIE
D: Well, I didn't know, with the drinking and all.
C: MOM
D: Nope, it was all you.
N: Ronnie nods.
C: MOM
D: I love you, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: I love you, too, Mom.
S: INT. CAPTAIN O'LANDERS - NIGHT
N: The restaurant is the cheesiest of all sea food restaurants. Think one step down from Red Lobster. Ronnie sits across the table from Brandi. She chugs one of those giant frozen drinks, killing it in one gulp.
C: RONNIE
D: Damn, that was pretty impressive.
C: BRANDI
D: Yeah, work's been pissing me off, so I just need to blow off some steam.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, Brandi, can I just say that you look absolutely beautiful tonight.
C: BRANDI
D: Yeah, I know. Nurse! Get me another -- You got this, right?
E: calling to waiter to Ronnie
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, yeah. No problem.
C: BRANDI
D: Nurse! Bring me another and keep 'em coming. I think it's funny to call the waitress nurse.
E: to Ronnie
N: Ronnie takes a pill bottle out of his pocket. He opens it up and pops a pill.
C: BRANDI
D: Hey, what's that?
C: RONNIE
D: Oh, it's nothing.
C: BRANDI
D: Don't be stingy, what the fuck is that?
C: RONNIE
D: It's just a pill I'm supposed to take.
C: BRANDI
D: Let me see.
N: Ronnie hands the pills to Brandi.
C: BRANDI
D: Where the fuck did you find these?
C: RONNIE
D: The Doctor.
C: BRANDI
D: Damn, Ronnie, Klonopin. I'm impressed. This is the good shit. I didn't know you partied like this.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I guess I party like this every four to six hours as needed.
C: BRANDI
D: Let me get one.
C: RONNIE
D: Help yourself.
C: BRANDI
D: Hell yeah!
N: Brandi pops a bunch of pills.
C: RONNIE
D: So, how do you like working at the mall?
C: BRANDI
D: I hate that shit. All I do is listen to bitching all day long. I got to put makeup on these fat- ass women all day and it's like, I don't give a shit what you do, you can't polish a turd.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I see how that could get to you.
C: BRANDI
D: Let's do some shots. Waiter, four shots of Jager!
C: RONNIE
D: That's a lot.
C: BRANDI
D: It's Friday.
C: RONNIE
D: So, Brandi, I hope I'm not being too forward, but do you have a boyfriend?
C: BRANDI
D: I've got a few hook-ups but nobody who is a boyfriend.
C: RONNIE
D: Yes!
C: BRANDI
D: You know, it's just like a time in my life where I want to be free right now and think about myself. Not get tied down to one person.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I understand. I hate ties. I recently cut mine and now I'm free like a bird.
N: The shots come.
C: BRANDI
D: Alright, bottoms up.
N: Ronnie holds up a shot to toast.
C: RONNIE
D: To new beginnings.
C: BRANDI
D: Right up your ass!
N: Brandi downs her shot.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay.
N: Ronnie takes his shot.
C: BRANDI
D: Oh, shit!
C: RONNIE
D: No more. I'm sticking to beer.
C: BRANDI
D: What's wrong, is your pussy hurting?
C: RONNIE
D: God, you remind me so much of my mother.
N: Brandi knocks back the other two shots.
C: BRANDI
D: Feel the burn, bitch!
C: RONNIE
D: You are so beautiful.
S: INT. RONNIE'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Ronnie's car is a piece-of-shit Subaru. Brandi is shit- faced and yelling at people out of the window.
C: BRANDI
D: Who wants to see my titties?!
N: Brandi lifts up her shirt and shows the passengers of other cars her boobs.
C: RONNIE
D: Brandi, this is the most fun I've ever had on a date.
C: BRANDI
D: For the last time, this ain't a date, motherfucker! This is a party!
C: RONNIE
D: Wooo! Um, so, Brandi, it's no secret that I'm attracted to you. I think everybody in the mall is. As you know, I recently split with my girlfriend and basically, I was wondering if, since you don't have a boyfriend, that I could maybe be your boyfriend and you could be my girlfriend?
C: BRANDI
D: That's my house!
N: Ronnie hits the brakes.
S: EXT. BRANDI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Ronnie opens Brandi's door and helps Brandi out. She's almost passed out drunk. Both of her eyes are closed and she immediately tries to sleep on the ground. Ronnie helps her up, but when he does, Brandi gives him a kiss -- a sloppy one.
C: RONNIE
D: Brandi, I had a wonderful time tonight.
C: BRANDI
D: I'm so fucking shit-faced.
N: They kiss again, but when they do, Brandi pukes all over the place. It's a disgusting puke and there's vomit on her cheek and stuff. Ronnie holds her head for her.
C: RONNIE
D: Are you okay?
C: BRANDI
D: My breath smells like asshole.
N: Ronnie looks longingly into her eyes.
C: RONNIE
D: I love you, Brandi.
C: BRANDI
D: I think I've got puke in my teeth.
C: RONNIE
D: I don't care.
N: Ronnie kisses Brandi passionately on the mouth. He walks her inside the house. On the way in, she falls over. Ronnie helps her up. He carries her into the house where the make-love spot is.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
N: Ronnie is with Dennis in the food court. Ronnie is smiling, but Dennis isn't saying a word as usual.
C: RONNIE
D: Don't look at me like that, Dennis. I told you I wouldn't talk.
N: Ronnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his face.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman never kisses and tells. So, just stop with all the pressure because it's just not gonna happen.
N: Ronnie keeps on grinning at Dennis.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, fine, you son of a bitch, you want details, I'll give you details. I had sex with Brandi last night.
N: Dennis and Ronnie high-five.
C: RONNIE
D: It was amazing. I mean, I've never experienced anything like it. I've been with a girl or two.
N: Dennis stares at Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, fine, I've been with a girl, but let me tell you, this was so much better. You know how many times we did it? Twice! BAM! BAM! BAM!
N: OVER AT THE CINNABON STAND Nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a whole Cinnabon into her face. As it fills her cheeks, she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making thrusting motions at the table. Nell swallows, stuffs another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court. BACK AT RONNIE'S TABLE Ronnie continues to talk to Dennis.
C: RONNIE
D: But I got to tell you, Dennis. It was steamy and sexy, but more than anything, I should tell you that it's her soul that I fell for the most. She got pretty tanked, but I could just really tell that she's a good person. The kind of person that I could see myself with.
E: MORE
C: RONNIE
D: Look, I'm gonna get out of here. There's a lot of people I need to tell about this, so I'll catch up with you later. Oh, and I almost forgot, keep your eyes peeled for crime and stuff.
E: CONT'D
N: Ronnie leaves the table.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: Nell watches Brandi as she pops a couple of aspirin behind the makeup counter. She takes a deep breath and walks up to the counter.
C: NELL
D: Excuse me.
C: BRANDI
D: How may I help you?
C: NELL
D: I need to talk to you.
C: BRANDI
D: What is it, honey? Let me guess. You're looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that puffiness under your eyes. I've got just the thing.
C: NELL
D: No, that's not it. Well, how much is it?
C: BRANDI
D: Fifty dollars for the bottle.
C: NELL
D: Okay, I'll take it.
N: Brandi begins to ring up the cream.
C: NELL
D: Listen, I know you're Ronnie's new girlfriend.
C: BRANDI
D: What the hell are you talking about?
C: NELL
D: It's okay. I know he left me to be with you and I accept that.
C: BRANDI
D: I don't know who you've been talking to, but it's safe to say that you're fucking trippin'.
C: NELL
D: It's fine really. It's going to take a while for me to get over it, but I'll be okay.
N: Nell starts to get all teary-eyed. She picks up a Kleenex from a box on the counter and wipes her eyes.
C: BRANDI
D: Oh fuckin' Lord. This is disgusting.
C: NELL
D: I'm sorry.
C: BRANDI
D: Pull it together. This is how you run around all the time? Have some self-respect. No wonder your man left you. Who the hell would want to be around this shit all day?
N: Nell pulls herself together.
C: NELL
D: Jesus teaches us to forgive. And I forgive you for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend. Plus, I feel pretty confident that you'll end up burning in hell because of the various evil ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction. But I just want to tell you that Ronnie is a good person. He does a lot of stupid stuff, but really, he wants to do good for the world. I want you to know that if you hurt him and ruin his heart, I will personally come down here and kick the ever living shit out of you.
N: Nell walks away.
C: BRANDI
D: You better fuckin' run, bitch!
N: Nell turns around and starts storming toward Brandi. Brandi throws her hands up, frightened.
C: BRANDI
D: I'm just kidding.
N: Nell stops charging and walks away. Nell walks past Bruce who is helping a customer at the end of the counter.
C: NELL
D: It's not too late to change your ways.
C: BRUCE
D: Okay. Thanks.
N: Nell walks out of the department store.
S: INT. MALL - FLOWER SHOP - DAY
N: Ronnie looks at the colorful flowers in the glass refrigerator. The FLOWER SALESMAN walks up to Ronnie.
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: Ronnie, I've been expecting you.
C: RONNIE
D: You have?
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: Oh yeah, I heard about last night. Brandi is quite the woman. Congratulations, my friend. Or should I say, welcome to the club?
N: The Flower Salesman winks and starts laughing. Ronnie doesn't. It gets weird so the Flower Salesman stops.
C: RONNIE
D: What color of roses do the women like anyway?
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: Well, it depends on what you are trying to say. The white roses symbolize innocence and purity.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, we're way past the color white if you know what I mean. What about the yellow ones?
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: Joy, happiness, appreciation.
C: RONNIE
D: I don't even know what to make of that.
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: The pink rose means thank you.
C: RONNIE
D: Next.
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: The red rose is the most powerful. It symbolizes love.
C: RONNIE
D: Why didn't you just say that? I'm a busy man here.
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: I'm sorry.
C: RONNIE
D: Forget it. Give me a big bag of the red ones.
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: Um, can I ask a question?
C: RONNIE
D: Go ahead.
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: Do you really like Brandi?
C: RONNIE
D: I've only been on one date with her, but I could see myself being with her for all of eternity.
C: FLOWER SALESMAN
D: Well, in that case, the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose.
C: RONNIE
D: Seems like a big bag of roses would be more love than just one, but I guess you're the expert. Gimme one.
N: The Flower Salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to Ronnie.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: Brandi is behind the counter gossiping with Bruce. Ronnie holds his rose and watches them from a distance. He takes a deep breath and then walks to the counter.
C: RONNIE
D: Brandi?
C: BRANDI
D: What are you doing here?
C: RONNIE
D: I came here to see you. And to present you with this single red rose. It symbolizes 'love.'
C: BRANDI
D: Ronnie, that's really... uncalled for.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, after last night, I just wanted you to know that it wasn't just some fling to me. It meant something special and I felt it deep in my soul.
C: BRUCE
D: You fucked the Security Guard? You are such a little slut!
E: PLAYFUL
C: BRANDI
D: Oh, like you've never been drunk, Bruce!
N: Brandi grabs Ronnie and pulls him off to the side.
C: BRANDI
D: Ronnie, look. I got to be honest with you. I barely remember last night.
C: RONNIE
D: I remember it for the both of us.
C: BRANDI
D: Okay, see here's the thing. I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna come on out with it. Ronnie, I could never date you seriously. I mean, you're a security guard.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm the head of Mall Security.
C: BRANDI
D: Exactly. The point is, I don't really see myself being with that. Like ever. You know what I mean?
C: RONNIE
D: Brandi, I know exactly what you mean. And I just want to thank you for being honest. You're telling me I'm not living up to my full potential in life. It's funny, because I've been feeling like this for quite some time. I guess I just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle I've been stuck on. How can you be with a man who isn't living the life he was meant to?
C: BRANDI
D: Yeah, something like that. And just you know, you're a security guard at the mall and it's like, come on, you know?
C: RONNIE
D: I don't like it, Brandi, but I do understand. I promise you this. Next time you see me, I will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud. I will be the man that you will be honored to call your life's love.
C: BRANDI
D: Don't bet on it.
C: RONNIE
D: I will though. I'll bet everything I have on you. Now I ask you for one favor. Although I am unworthy, will you accept this rose from me anyway?
C: BRANDI
D: I can't do that. And tell your girlfriend to stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit.
N: Brandi walks away, leaving Ronnie there holding his flower.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
N: Ronnie sits at a small table and waits patiently. Then a POLICEMAN walks into the room. Ronnie stands to shake his hand.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm here to become a police officer.
C: POLICEMAN
D: We're always on the hunt for new recruits. Do you have at least a high school diploma?
C: RONNIE
D: I have a GED.
C: POLICEMAN
D: We usually prefer an actual diploma, but GED is technically acceptable. Are you a citizen of the United States?
C: RONNIE
D: You bet your ass I am.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy. Physical evaluation, psychological test, background check.
E: MORE
C: POLICEMAN
D: If you pass these tests, you will be admitted to the police academy. Now, I like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision. It's where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol. It helps give you an idea of the kind of situations you'll be dealing with. Sound good?
E: CONT'D
C: RONNIE
D: That sounds fun. Sign me up.
S: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
N: Ronnie sits in the unmarked police car with Detective Harrison.
C: RONNIE
D: It's like it was meant to be. You behind the wheel. Me riding shotgun. Two brothers of the badge unite to form the ultimate crime-stopping combo. I'm psyched to be here, Harrison. Thank you for the opportunity.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: You requested to ride along with me.
C: RONNIE
D: I know. You want to know the truth. It's because I respect you. See, when we're at the mall, it's obviously my turf. Sure, I break your balls about being a rookie, but out here in the streets, I'm the rookie. I'm here to learn. Teach me.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Why do you want to become a Cop?
C: RONNIE
D: I've wanted to be a Police officer all my life.
E: MORE
C: RONNIE
D: Don't get me wrong, I love keeping the mall safe, but you guys are the ones that really enforce justice and protect, not just our mall, but our whole community. I don't tell the guys on my squad this, but the Security Guard job was just temporary.
E: CONT'D
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Well, just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way.
C: RONNIE
D: Right, we're not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: What are you talking about?
C: RONNIE
D: Well, I know that policy demands I stay out of the way, but between you and me, I just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight, I'm going to jump right in there and take 'em down with you.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: No, no. Ronnie, policy says you have to stay in the car.
C: RONNIE
D: I get you. You have to say this in order to keep you safe 'legally' speaking. I should probably follow along too. 'I swear I won't get out of the car and fight justice tonight.'
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, you really can't.
C: RONNIE
D: I know.
N: Ronnie winks at Detective Harrison. A smile comes across Harrison's face.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I'm glad we understand each other.
N: Detective Harrison puts the car in drive and the guys head off for the night.
S: INT. POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Ronnie and Detective Harrison sit in the parked car. They're at the shittiest crack corner in the whole town. Lots of scary bums and hookers loiter around the car.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, so then I basically saw his ass trying to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit. Not allowed. The two ped exits are to be used only --
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: You see that corner there, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I see it.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That corner used to be the worst corner in this whole town. It was riddled with drugs, prostitution, and gang violence. It was nicknamed 'The Crossroads.'
C: RONNIE
D: Shit, I've heard of that.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That's right, but myself and the other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks of this neighborhood wouldn't have to worry about being safe. Yes, sir, that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force.
C: RONNIE
D: I don't know. It looks pretty shitty to me.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Well, it's a low income area, Ronnie. You're being kind of prejudiced.
C: RONNIE
D: Oh, yeah, I can see that it's basically a fine neighborhood.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That's right, but it hasn't been easy. We still patrol this area every night just to keep our presence up.
C: RONNIE
D: I use that same technique at the mall.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I'm sure. I usually do the foot patrols myself, but because I like you, I'm going to let you do it tonight.
C: RONNIE
D: Really?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Yeah, really. But I told you about department policy, so I'm going to need you to keep quiet about this one.
C: RONNIE
D: You can count on me. Thank you for the honor.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Of course, Ronnie. I just really believe in you.
C: RONNIE
D: I won't let you down.
N: Ronnie opens the door and gets out of the car. As he exits, a car drives by BLARING RAP MUSIC. The passenger throws a beer bottle at Ronnie. He dodges it and the bottle shatters on the ground. Ronnie is shaken, but he waves to Detective Harrison like he's okay. Detective Harrison waves back, then PEELS OUT OF THERE. Ronnie is confused.
C: RONNIE
D: Where are you going?!
N: Detective Harrison keeps on driving without looking back.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CROSSROADS - A SHORT TIME LATER
N: Ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard. A BUM stands off to the side staring Ronnie down. Ronnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under his throat. Ronnie tries to ignore him. A group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly.
C: RONNIE
D: Hey, no horse play. You guys get on home.
C: KID
D: You want some crack?
C: RONNIE
D: No, I don't want any crack. In fact, I didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice in the matter. I'm placing you under citizen's arrest.
N: Ronnie grabs the little Kid by the shoulders to restrain him.
C: KID
D: Let me go, motherfucker!
C: RONNIE
D: I place you under citizen's arrest for the crime of selling a Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the right to remain silent...
N: Unbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up behind him. It's like that scene in Training Day where all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street with guns and shit. They come up behind him as he speaks to the kids...
C: RONNIE
D: ... If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Now I guess we just wait here for my ride to come back.
N: Ronnie turns around to look for Harrison's return, but instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of pissed-off GANG MEMBERS. GANG MEMBER #1 That's my little brother you got there.
C: RONNIE
D: Who, this little guy right here?
N: GANG MEMBER #1 That's right.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal drugs. I know it's hard for you to hear that.
N: GANG MEMBER #1 He works for me, motherfucker!
C: RONNIE
D: Is that so? Well then, it looks like you got one less employee because I'm taking little brother down. I'll die right here before I let crime prevail.
N: The Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them at Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: Free to go, little brother. My mistake completely. Good luck with the crack.
E: to the little Kid
N: The little Kid runs off.
C: RONNIE
D: Alright, so I guess I'll be seeing you folks.
N: The Gang Members stand in Ronnie's way and cock their guns. GANG MEMBER #2 Yo, waste this pig, Tone.
C: RONNIE
D: Oh, no. That's really not necessary, Tone.
N: GANG MEMBER #2 Do it, man. Gang Member #1 puts the gun right up to Ronnie's head.
C: RONNIE
D: Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die. Don't let me die, don't do it!
N: Ronnie goes down on his knees.
C: RONNIE
D: No, please! I'm sorry!
N: Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod. He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick. Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast precision. Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja. Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker punch, busting his nose wide open. Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass. Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping Ronnie. Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins beating him senseless. SLOW MOTION: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal and also at his best.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Detective Harrison is eating doughnuts and laughing with a bunch of other COPS. COP #1 I can't believe you dropped him off at the Crossroads. That's fucking hilarious.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Trust me, you would have done the same thing. This guy is without a doubt the biggest fucking idiot I have ever met.
N: COP #1 He's probably going to get killed.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Good! Fuck him, I hope he does get killed.
N: All of a sudden, Ronnie comes in all beaten and bruised.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, what are you doing here?
C: RONNIE
D: I know what you did!
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, look, I didn't do anything --
C: RONNIE
D: You're not going to talk your way out of this one. You set me up!
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, look --
C: RONNIE
D: Don't try to deny it! You set me up and that's all there is to it.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, I --
C: RONNIE
D: And I just want to thank you for it.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Thank me? Why?
C: RONNIE
D: Because I'm proud to report that I passed the test. I know you wanted to see if I had the chops to cut it on the police force and I'm glad to say that I passed. I knew I would get initiated some time, but I didn't think it would be so soon. Thank you, Detective Harrison. Thank you for believing in me.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, I don't know what to say.
C: RONNIE
D: You don't have to say anything. Your actions speak for themselves. Thank you for giving this rookie a shot. Get used to seeing Ronnie Barnhardt around here, boys.
S: BAD-ASS PHYSICAL EXAM MONTAGE - INT. TRAINING FIELD -
N: DAY SPRINT: The TESTING OFFICER blows a whistle and starts the 100 meter dash. Ronnie jumps off the starting line and hauls ass down the track. The other Trainees fall behind Ronnie as he smokes their asses. PULL-UPS: Ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull- up after pull-up. SIDE SLIDE: The Testing Officer blows a whistle and Ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater that never moves forward. SIT-UPS: Ronnie goes hard on the sit-ups. OBSTACLE COURSE: Ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to the other side. He charges a body of water, then jumps onto the rope and swings safely to the other side.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - NIGHT
N: All the lights are off and we see the dark shadow creep through the darkness. The shadow breaks into the SHOE STORE and grabs as many pairs of sneakers that it can carry. The shadow opens the sliding cage and closes it from the other side. Then bends down and locks it.
S: INT. MALL - MANAGER'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
N: Mark sits behind his desk reading a paper. The HEADLINE READS: CHAOS CLIMBS AT CAROLINA MALL. There's a KNOCK at the door.
C: MARK
D: Come in.
N: Ronnie sticks his head in the door.
C: RONNIE
D: Good morning, Mark.
C: MARK
D: Is it, Ronnie? I mean, the mall is getting butchered in the press. Somebody who works here is ripping the place off. The cops don't have any leads. I'm getting shit from the owner of the mall. Sales are down. I mean, what's so good about this morning?
C: RONNIE
D: I feel your pain, Mark. Quite frankly, there's two things happening. One, I'm lacking a sufficient firearm. And two, we're understaffed. That's why I come to you this morning with a plan. Come on in, Charles.
E: calling to the door
N: Charles opens the door and walks in.
C: MARK
D: Who is this?
C: RONNIE
D: This is Charles, sir.
C: CHARLES
D: How's it going?
E: BOUNCER
C: MARK
D: You work at O'Charley's, right.
C: CHARLES
D: That's right.
C: RONNIE
D: Mark, I would like to hire Charles here as an additional Security Guard. He would operate under me. I figure with the additional criminal element, we should hire more security in hopes that we would have a better chance of catching these guys.
C: MARK
D: Do you have any experience, son?
C: CHARLES
D: Not really.
C: RONNIE
D: Um, sir, I have personally been training young Charles for weeks now in preparation for this day. The kid kind of looks up to me. I'm some what of a big brother to the little guy.
N: Charles kind of looks at Ronnie like he's crazy.
C: MARK
D: Alright, it's actually not a bad idea. It might make our Security more visible so we can give people the illusion that we're on top of this.
N: Ronnie winks at Charles.
C: CHARLES
D: Thank you, Mark.
C: MARK
D: Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if this crime doesn't come to an end pretty soon, we're gonna have to let someone go. I mean, you've always done a great job for me, but the truth is, someone is going to have to take the fall. You're the one who wanted to be Head of Mall Security and quite frankly, I just bought my wife a new Cadillac, so let's just say it won't be me.
C: RONNIE
D: With Charles on my team, I can now devote more time to the robbery and Pervert case. I plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week.
N: Mark laughs to himself.
C: RONNIE
D: Why'd you just laugh?
C: MARK
D: It's nothing. Have fun, Ronnie.
N: Ronnie looks at Charles.
C: RONNIE
D: Did I say something funny?
C: CHARLES
D: Let's go, Ronnie.
N: Ronnie and Charles take off.
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie and Charles stand in the middle of the floor and supervise the "mall walkers."
C: CHARLES
D: Be careful, guys. Nice and slow.
C: RONNIE
D: That's not bad, but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice. Watch this. Slow it down! Slow it down! You've already received one verbal, don't make me issue a second! See, you can't be intimidated. You have to make them respect you.
E: back to Charles
C: CHARLES
D: Ronnie, you know I really want to thank you for the job. You're a man of your word.
C: RONNIE
D: No problem, my young student. So, I got something to tell you. Keep this between us until it's official, but I don't think I'm going to be here for much longer.
C: CHARLES
D: You're quitting? But you love this job.
C: RONNIE
D: I do love it, but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force.
C: CHARLES
D: The real police?
C: RONNIE
D: They're calling me up. It's basically a done deal. Just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun.
C: CHARLES
D: I didn't even know you wanted to become a Cop.
C: RONNIE
D: It's always been my job. The Mall thing is great training, but it has its limitations. Some stars are just meant to shine brighter than others.
C: CHARLES
D: Congrats, brother.
C: RONNIE
D: HEY, SLOW IT DOWN, LADY!
E: to a mall walker
N: A Mall Walker slows her pace. She turns around and Ronnie sees that it's Nell.
C: RONNIE
D: Nell?
C: NELL
D: Hey, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: What are you doing?
C: NELL
D: Nothing, just getting in shape.
C: RONNIE
D: Well, that's okay, I guess. Just watch your speed, okay?
N: Nell waves and walks on.
C: CHARLES
D: Isn't that your girlfriend?
C: RONNIE
D: Ex.
C: CHARLES
D: She looked good.
C: RONNIE
D: You think so?
C: CHARLES
D: She looks a lot better.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah.
N: Ronnie shrugs it off.
S: INT. PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION - DAY
N: Ronnie sits across from a female PSYCHOLOGIST.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Okay, Ronnie, today I'll be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you're competent to enter into the Police Academy. It's really just a formality. Don't want any serial killers working for us, now do we?
C: RONNIE
D: No, ma'am, we don't.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Okay, Ronnie, so let's start with your background. Where are you from?
C: RONNIE
D: Born and raised right here.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Local boy. Okay, and, Ronnie, have you ever been convicted of any crimes?
C: RONNIE
D: No, ma'am. My record is totally clean.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past?
C: RONNIE
D: No, ma'am. I believe drugs are the path to self-destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Any prescription medications?
C: RONNIE
D: Yes, for my nerves. A man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with. If you've seen the bloodshed I've seen, you'd be on the meds too. I -- Where are you going with this?
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Are you presently or have you ever been affiliated with the Communist Party?
C: RONNIE
D: I can't believe you'd even ask me that.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Have you ever been in the military?
C: RONNIE
D: Yes.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: What branch of the military were you in?
C: RONNIE
D: The kind of branch that doesn't exist on paper.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Okay, here's a real world scenario. You have a gun --
C: RONNIE
D: Finally.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: That wasn't really the question, never mind, I think I got that one. Um... here's one. Do you feel like you would work well on a team?
C: RONNIE
D: Would I? Yes. Would I be more useful working alone, I would say definitely. I see myself more like a Rambo kind of guy. A man who rolls solo. Taking care of business on his own terms. Kind of like a Superhero or something.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Why do you want to become a cop?
C: RONNIE
D: I want to become a cop to help people. The world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere. See, I have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there I stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away. Just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town. I know I could do some good if I was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Uh-huh. So, what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today?
C: RONNIE
D: Maybe Russian gang activity, but you know what? I think I'm gonna have to go with evil on that one too.
C: PSYCHOLOGIST
D: Okay, I think we're good here. It's been a pleasure, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: Thank you, ma'am.
S: INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Ronnie's Mom takes a bath and swigs on a bottle. She's drunk and passing out in the tub. Ronnie scrubs her back with a sponge.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm telling you, Mom, this police thing could be good for both of us. Not just the fact that I'll be making the streets safer for you, but they have health insurance and a pension plan so I don't have to worry about your medical bills as much.
C: MOM
D: I don't care about that bullshit. All I need is a little nip of this good shit right here and I'm ready to walk through the pearly gates.
C: RONNIE
D: Mom, I know, but maybe you should stop drinking so much. You're getting up there and you know what the doctor said about your liver.
C: MOM
D: I don't tell you how to party, don't tell me how to live my life. I've taken care of you since you were born.
C: RONNIE
D: I just worry about you is all.
C: MOM
D: Ronnie, don't get your hopes up about this police thing.
C: RONNIE
D: Why would you say that?
C: MOM
D: You know why. I just don't want to see you get hurt. It's my job to protect you from the bullshit.
C: RONNIE
D: Mom, I appreciate it, but I'm going to make it as a police officer. I'm tired of coming in second all the time. Everybody in life gets to go for their goals, why should I be any different?
C: MOM
D: I know. Just be careful is all. You've got a good heart and I don't want to see it broken.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, Mom. I hear you.
C: MOM
D: And, Ronnie, one more thing.
C: RONNIE
D: What's that, Mom?
N: In the tub, a bunch of bubbles plop to the surface.
C: RONNIE
D: Mom! That's gross!
C: MOM
D: That's right! Now you got to smell it!
E: drunk laughing
C: RONNIE
D: Mom.
S: EXT. POLICE ACADEMY - DAY
N: The Police Academy is full of energy as new recruits pour up the steps and into the building, eager to start their training. Ronnie comes walking up and takes a long look at the building. Ronnie smiles to himself and heads up the stairs. Ronnie reaches the top where Detective Harrison is waiting. Ronnie stops.
C: RONNIE
D: Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for duty.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: I can see that. Listen, I don't really know how to say this, but we're not going to be able to let you join the academy.
C: RONNIE
D: What?! Why not?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: It seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements.
C: RONNIE
D: Did I fail one of the tests?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Well, yes, actually, you failed the psychological exam.
C: RONNIE
D: No!
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: It says... That Ronnie Barnhardt shows warning signs of delusion and allowing him to join the force puts his life and the lives of others in jeopardy.
E: reads from the form
C: RONNIE
D: Detective Harrison, you've got to believe me. I'm completely sound. This has got to be a mistake.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, I personally did your background check and this is the fifth time you've been turned down for the police academy.
C: RONNIE
D: You guys keep records on that?
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: We sure do. Look, I tried to talk to them, but there's no way they're gonna let you in. I'm sorry, but your dreams of becoming a Police Officer just aren't going to happen.
C: RONNIE
D: I understand. Thanks for believing in me, Detective. And just for the record, I'm not crazy.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Take care, Ronnie.
N: Detective Harrison goes inside and closes the doors on Ronnie. Ronnie stands outside of the closed academy by himself. The CAMERA PUSHES INTO Ronnie and SPINS UPSIDE-DOWN.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
N: Ronnie is behind the locked gate to the food court, but it looks like he is behind bars in a prison. Ronnie slides the bars up and walks out.
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie walks through the mall and looks at the lights of the different shops. Everything looks colorful and weird. Ronnie is in his own head. This isn't the exciting world as before, now it's a disgusting fabricated make-believe land. TIME LAPSE: A DAY SPEEDS BY AS RONNIE WALKS LIKE A ZOMBIE THROUGH IT ALL.
S: INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - NIGHT
N: The mall is kind of winding down for the day. The stores are closing and people are going home. Ronnie sees Nell putting her apron away and preparing to leave. Ronnie walks up to her.
C: RONNIE
D: Hey, Nell.
C: NELL
D: Hey, Ronnie. How's it going?
C: RONNIE
D: Can I talk to you for a second?
C: NELL
D: What is it?
C: RONNIE
D: I tried to get into the police academy again and the same thing happened.
C: NELL
D: Oh, Ronnie, I'm sorry.
N: Ronnie starts to tear up.
C: RONNIE
D: Why does this keep happening to me, Nell?
C: NELL
D: I don't know, Ronnie. Maybe it's just not meant to be. Are you okay?
C: RONNIE
D: No. Are you going home? I mean, do you want to go somewhere and talk or something?
C: NELL
D: Ronnie, I can't.
C: RONNIE
D: Why not?
C: NELL
D: I've got plans.
C: RONNIE
D: What plans?
C: SADDAMN
D: Look at this sorry piece of shit.
N: Ronnie looks up to see Saddamn walking toward him.
C: RONNIE
D: What the fuck do you want?
C: SADDAMN
D: I don't want anything from you. How you doing, sweetness?
E: to Nell
N: Saddamn hugs Nell from behind and kisses her on the cheek.
C: SADDAMN
D: You look beautiful tonight.
C: RONNIE
D: What the fuck is going on?
C: SADDAMN
D: You ready to go? We got reservations at 9:00.
C: NELL
D: I'm ready, Saddamn.
C: RONNIE
D: Nell, for the love of God, don't go with him.
C: NELL
D: I'm sorry, Ronnie.
N: Nell and Saddamn turn and walk towards the door. On the way out, Saddamn turns back around to Ronnie and smiles. Then, he begins to "air hump" Nell from behind.
C: RONNIE
D: Don't go, Nell. Remember your purity! Remember your purity!
N: Nell and Saddamn leave the mall.
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie sits down on one of the benches in the mall. He watches a couple walk by, their little kid swinging between their arms. Then, Stevie comes in and takes a seat next to Ronnie.
C: STEVIE
D: What are you doing, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: I'm just taking a break. What do you want, Stevie? I don't have time to fuck around with you today.
C: STEVIE
D: I got something.
N: Stevie reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a bunch of Polaroids of penises.
C: RONNIE
D: What the fuck is this?
C: DUDE
D: Dude, I found these all over the mall. I'm guessing that whoever this Mall Flasher is, left these for girls to find.
C: RONNIE
D: This thing gets grosser and grosser all the time. Well, thanks for the clue. Maybe I can use this to identify the freak. You can skate all you want around here.
C: STEVIE
D: What's wrong with you, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: What do you mean?
C: STEVIE
D: I don't know. You just seem kind of sad.
C: RONNIE
D: Nah, man, I'm fine. I mean, I'm catchin' perverts and protecting this mall and just you know, really livin' the dream.
C: STEVIE
D: That's cool. Look, man, you want to get high?
C: RONNIE
D: No, I don't want to get high.
C: STEVIE
D: That's cool.
N: The conversation dies down and the two just kind of sit there.
C: RONNIE
D: And by the way, if I see you getting high, I will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested. Don't you fuckin' ever mistake my kindness for weakness. I hate drugs and I hate you too.
C: STEVIE
D: Fine, you fucking dick.
N: Steve stands up to leave. Ronnie sits there looking sad.
S: EXT. MALL - NIGHT
N: Ronnie sits in his golf cart staring at the mall as the last of the customers leave. That's when Ronnie sees Brandi come out of the door. Brandi looks around and darts across the parking lot. Ronnie follows Brandi's path and tries to catch up with her.
S: EXT. MALL - NIGHT
N: Ronnie drives around, but he can't find Brandi anywhere. Ronnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the parking lot. He pulls his golf cart over and climbs out. Ronnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window. Inside, Ronnie sees Brandi and Detective Harrison banging like a couple of wild animals. Ronnie jumps back in shock!
S: INT. DETECTIVE HARRISON'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Brandi stops humping Detective Harrison.
C: BRANDI
D: Shhhh.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: What is it?
C: BRANDI
D: I thought I heard something.
N: Detective Harrison looks out of the window. He doesn't see anything. He climbs back on top of Brandi.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: It's nothing.
N: OUT OF NOWHERE, A FLASHLIGHT BREAKS THE BACK WINDOW OF THE CAR.
S: EXT. MALL - NIGHT
N: Ronnie runs around Detective Harrison's car wielding a flashlight like a mad man.
C: RONNIE
D: HARRISON!!!
N: Ronnie beats the shit out of Harrison's car. He smashes headlights, mirrors and fenders. INSIDE THE CAR Harrison and Brandi duck down.
C: BRANDI
D: Shit!
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That motherfucker is crazy.
C: BRANDI
D: Well, you're the fucking cop. Do something.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: You're right. Okay, here it goes.
N: Harrison reaches over Brandi and opens her door.
C: BRANDI
D: What the fuck are you doing?!
N: Harrison pushes Brandi out of the car and shuts himself back in. OUTSIDE Ronnie sees Brandi and stops pummeling the car.
C: BRANDI
D: Ronnie, it's me! Don't do anything crazy.
C: RONNIE
D: Get back inside, Brandi. This isn't about you... you... you slut!
C: BRANDI
D: Fuck off, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: How can you just stand there after you ruined my life and act like nothing happened?!
C: BRANDI
D: It's easy 'cause I don't give a FUCK ABOUT YOU!
N: Ronnie SNAPS. He charges at Brandi with the flashlight over his head. He's about to crack her when... CLICK. Ronnie STOPS to see Harrison on the other side of him with his pistol drawn and pointed at Ronnie.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Drop the flashlight, Ronnie.
N: Ronnie drops the flashlight from his hands.
C: RONNIE
D: You're pretty tough with that gun.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie, I know you've had a hard time --
C: RONNIE
D: You were supposed to be my friend!
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: So you're gonna kill Brandi?
C: RONNIE
D: I was just trying to scare her.
C: BRANDI
D: You don't scare me, you piece of shit.
N: Ronnie lifts the flashlight up again like he's going to hit Brandi. Brandi ducks. Detective Harrison cocks the gun.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: Ronnie!
C: RONNIE
D: Fine, fuck you! Fuck all of you! And, Harrison, you better be glad you have a gun or I'd kick your ass too. And you know what? I'm taking my friendship back because you don't deserve it! And, Brandi, I'm taking my love back too. I'm gonna leave now and you two can just have fun. Have fun sleeping tonight because something tells me, you won't be able to.
N: Ronnie climbs into the golf cart and drives off.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: That guy is a nut job.
C: BRANDI
D: Tell me about it.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: So you slept with him?
C: BRANDI
D: I was drunk okay. You gonna make a big deal out of it.
C: DETECTIVE HARRISON
D: No, I guess not.
C: BRANDI
D: Fine.
S: INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: ON THE TELEVISION: There's an update on the CAROLINA MALL FLASHER. It says he has exposed himself to more girls. As the TV blares the headline, Ronnie lays in his bed and watches. The images shine COLOR on him, but Ronnie is in his own world.
S: INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
N: Ronnie has the Special Elite Task Force assembled.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm disbanding the task force.
C: CHARLES
D: Hey, Ronnie, that's crazy talk. Are you cool?
C: RONNIE
D: No, I'm not cool, Charles. In fact, shit is seriously fucked up. I've got to protect the whole mall by myself. Now, I got you this fucking job, when are you going to stop being a little baby and do something for a change. 'I don't want to do anything hard. I just want to be a little bitch and brag about dropping out of college.' Grow a fucking pair, will you, Chucky?
E: MOCKING
C: CHARLES
D: I'm gonna go check the parking lot.
N: Charles walks away.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm sorry, Charles! I didn't mean it, buddy!
E: calling out
N: Ronnie puts his head on the table.
C: RONNIE
D: You know, Dennis, for the longest time I made this job my whole life. I looked at this mall as a kingdom and I looked at Mark as the King. I thought of myself as the first Knight and the customers, well, they were the peasants. I lived by an old code where one was bound by duty and honor. But now I don't know if I believe in that code anymore. I've lost my way. Now I just feel like it's one big kingdom of shit. Right now, I got half a mind just to let this whole place burn. Burn it to the fucking ground!
N: Dennis stares down at the desk. Dennis takes off his hat and reveals that he has bleached white Eminem hair underneath. Next, he reaches under his collar and flips out a thin gold necklace. He kicks up his shoes and reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks. This is the REAL DENNIS and for the first time ever, he speaks...
C: DENNIS
D: I've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time. You look at this mall as a Kingdom?! Shit! I look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. You put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting? Commerce and corporations and money. Well I say, fuck that! I'm a fucking outlaw and I'm going to live that until the day I die. Now, I can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it. So I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are you ready for a trip to the other side?
E: high ghetto voice
C: RONNIE
D: You're goddamn right I'm ready.
C: DENNIS
D: Alright then. Let's party.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DUMPSTERS - DAY
N: Dennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the dumpsters. Dennis sucks down a fat joint. He passes it to Ronnie.
C: DENNIS
D: So, yeah, usually I take a joint straight to the head before I start work in this motherfucker, but on really stressful days, I like to get drunk too.
N: Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and begins violently coughing. He finally stops.
C: RONNIE
D: Fuck it, give me the bottle.
N: Dennis hands Ronnie the bottle and he takes a big swig.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie and Dennis stand against a wall while they check out booties of various shapes and sizes on all of the girls that walk by.
C: DENNIS
D: So then I usually come in here and perv out on girls for about an hour or two. I hooked up twice last week. One was this Asian chick and the other was this mom. She wasn't that hot, but what else do I got to do?
N: Two high school girls walk by.
C: DENNIS
D: Sweet Jesus in the morning.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY
N: Ronnie and Dennis are hanging in a dressing room.
C: DENNIS
D: Dressing rooms are a great place to hide out, because nobody is really going to think of looking for me here. You can nap or just kind of hang out and just really have some personal time. Hey, hand me that camera.
N: Ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis.
C: DENNIS
D: Thanks, Ronnie.
N: Dennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other changing room. The two high school girls are changing into other clothes. Dennis starts taking pictures of them without them knowing.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DUMPSTERS - DAY
N: Ronnie is smoking a joint and so is Dennis.
C: DENNIS
D: Right before lunch I usually blaze up again real good.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MALL - DAY
N: Dennis and Ronnie walk by the skaters.
C: DENNIS
D: Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?!
C: STEVIE
D: What up, Big Den?!
C: DENNIS
D: You know, smokin' that good good.
C: STEVIE
D: Dude, why are you hanging out with Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: Fuck you, Stevie!
C: DENNIS
D: Hey, Ronnie's alright. Let me see that stick.
N: Stevie slides the skateboard over to Dennis. He jumps on it and does a perfectly executed kick flip. The skaters cheer!
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: Brandi is at the counter with Bruce. She helps a MALE customer.
C: BRANDI
D: That'll be $39.99.
C: MALE
D: My wife's gonna love this perfume.
C: BRANDI
D: I hope so. It's my favorite.
N: Brandi looks past the Customer and sees Ronnie just standing there staring daggers at her. Ronnie shakes his head in disgust. The Male Customer turns around and sees Ronnie. It's a weird little moment. Dennis grabs Ronnie by the arm.
C: DENNIS
D: Come on, brother. Let's go.
N: Ronnie follows Dennis off.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
N: THIS BEGINS THE ROCKING MONTAGE OF MALL DESTRUCTION
S: INT. RECORD STORE - DAY
N: Ronnie stands in the store and looks down at his walkie.
C: MARK
D: Ronnie, we need you down at the candy store. Some little brat has been shoveling peanuts in his mouth for the last hour.
E: V.O. over the walkie
N: Ronnie turns the walkie-talkie off. Dennis runs behind the counter. Dennis drops the needle on a ROCKIN' SONG. Dennis jumps on top of the counter and starts jumping up and down with the music. He's fucking drunk. Dennis jumps off the counter and tackles Ronnie, knocking over a stand of DVD's.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie and Dennis ride on a mini railroad train for kids. They both drink from the flask as they spin around the track. It's full of nothing but kids and security.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY
N: The HOT SALES CLERK stands outside of the dressing room wearing a sexy teddy with a G-string and garters. Dennis and Ronnie are kicking back in the love seat and watching. Dennis makes a motion for the Sales Clerk to spin around. She reluctantly does as she is instructed.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALL - TOY STORE - DAY
N: Ronnie and Dennis play video games. A LITTLE KID tries to take the controller from Dennis, but Dennis whips out the handcuffs. He locks the Little Kid onto the display case so the kid can't move.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ARCADE - DAY
N: Ronnie and Dennis play Skee-Ball, except Ronnie tosses the balls to Dennis who is standing on top of the machine. Dennis slam dunks the balls into the 100 point hole. The tickets pour out.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie and Dennis are driving in the golf cart and they're both wearing those GIANT SUNGLASSES that they won with arcade tickets. Behind them, Stevie and the other Skaters hold onto the golf cart and get pulled on their skateboards. They race towards a loading ramp. Dennis floors it and they go up the ramp and JUMP the golf cart into the air. The golf cart and Skaters soar into the air. It holds forever, until suddenly, the golf cart lands with a thud.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. MALL - NIGHT
N: The mall is basically empty as Dennis and Ronnie make the final rounds. They get to the doors and lock up for the night.
C: RONNIE
D: Dennis, I got to thank you for today. Man, I was so down, but you taught me that I don't need to take things so seriously here. We have a pointless existence. Who gives a fuck?
C: DENNIS
D: Don't mention it, homey. I'm just glad I got me a partner in crime.
C: RONNIE
D: A partner. I like that. You know, I've never really had a friend before, but I think that this could be the beginning of a real good thing.
N: Dennis unlocks the doors to the Gap.
C: DENNIS
D: You ain't even seen the best part. After everybody leaves, I rob the shit out of this place.
C: RONNIE
D: What do you mean?
C: DENNIS
D: I steal shit!
C: RONNIE
D: You're the one who's been robbing the mall?
C: DENNIS
D: Hell yeah! Who'd you think it was?!
N: Dennis goes inside the Gap and just starts grabbing shit.
C: RONNIE
D: I can't believe this. Right in front of my goddamn face this whole time!
N: Dennis holds up a sweat shirt.
C: DENNIS
D: This probably will look good with my complexion.
C: RONNIE
D: Dennis, I can't take part in this.
C: DENNIS
D: Ronnie, I thought you were down?! What the fuck?! Here I am opening up myself to you and you're just gonna stick it to me like this. What the fuck has this place ever done for you? Don't you know that people see us as jokes?! A useless tool that's left in the shed. Well that's not me. Not now, not ever. I told you, I'm an outlaw.
C: RONNIE
D: I can't let you rob the mall.
C: DENNIS
D: What the fuck you mean you can't let me?
C: RONNIE
D: Come on, Dennis. We're best friends, so just put that stuff back and let's go get a beer.
C: DENNIS
D: Alright, Ronnie, you're right.
N: Dennis sets the shirts down.
C: DENNIS
D: I don't really know what I was thinking. Robbing the mall? Let's just go get that beer.
C: RONNIE
D: Good, man. That makes me feel better.
N: Ronnie turns to walk, but Dennis grabs the hand of one of the mannequins and rips it off. He takes the hand and cracks Ronnie over the head with it. Ronnie goes down on his knees.
C: DENNIS
D: See ya in Mexico, bitch.
N: Dennis cocks back and whacks Ronnie again. Ronnie's lights go out.
S: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
N: Dennis pulls out of the mall driving a HARLEY DAVIDSON. He flips a joint into the air and peels out. He cruises down the street. He passes a cop car and flips it off.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
N: The JANITOR walks up the floor with a mop. Ronnie is battered and bloodied from his fight with Dennis, but he is wide awake and handcuffed to THE GAP.
C: RONNIE
D: Ramon, get your ass over here! Go get my spare keys out of the office.
N: The Janitor looks at Ronnie, smiles, and calmly mops in the other direction.
C: RONNIE
D: Ramon! Goddamn it get back here! Go get my goddamn keys.
S: INT. MALL - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Mark sits across the desk from Ronnie and Charles.
C: MARK
D: How fucking stupid do you have to be?! I mean Dennis. What the fuck, Ronnie? How could you not have known it was Dennis? Then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away. OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the only two things you have to do and you can't do those worth a shit.
C: RONNIE
D: Can I speak now?
C: MARK
D: Go ahead.
C: RONNIE
D: Are you sure?
C: MARK
D: Just start talking, Ronnie!
C: RONNIE
D: It seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on myself. But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them. Some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that I was under- equipped and quite frankly, lacking a sufficient firearm. But not me. I carry this loss alone deep inside my heart.
C: MARK
D: Good. Because you're fired.
C: RONNIE
D: Fuck you.
E: PLAYFUL
C: MARK
D: I'm serious, Ronnie. I've always liked you, but there's just no excuse for this. Somebody is going down and I'll be damned if it's going to be me. Now, don't make a big thing out of this. Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day.
C: RONNIE
D: Wait a minute. I thought I could trust you, Mark, and now you're telling me that you're going to be the one to put the knife in my back. Fair weather friend you are.
C: MARK
D: I'm not your friend, I'm your boss.
C: RONNIE
D: You think you're so smart, Mark. You don't know everything. If you're firing me, then you can say goodbye to your entire Security staff. Because there is no fucking way my team is going to work here if you fire me. Isn't that right, Charles?
C: CHARLES
D: Ronnie, I got to talk to you about this. Mark asked me down here to escort you out.
C: RONNIE
D: And you told him to fuck off, right? Charles? Right?
C: CHARLES
D: What the fuck do you want from me, Ronnie?
C: RONNIE
D: This isn't happening! Everybody is fucking me over?! I hate you all.
N: Charles stands up.
C: CHARLES
D: I'm sorry, Ronnie, but it's time to go.
C: RONNIE
D: Wait a minute. I'll work for free, Mark.
C: MARK
D: No, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: I'll pay you.
C: MARK
D: Nope.
C: RONNIE
D: I love you.
C: MARK
D: Ronnie, Jesus have a little self- respect.
C: RONNIE
D: You don't love me, Mark?
C: MARK
D: Ronnie, it's over.
N: Ronnie takes a deep breath. He stands up to leave. Ronnie starts to walk out, but stops.
C: RONNIE
D: Hey, Charles. Mark asked you down here in case I got out of hand? Well, get ready to earn your money.
N: Ronnie cracks. He grabs a calendar and throws it on the ground in a violent baby-like outburst.
C: MARK
D: Stop him!
N: Charles tries to grab Ronnie, but Ronnie pushes him off. Ronnie knocks the framed pictures off of the wall. He then opens the door and slams it into the wall over and over again. That does nothing. Ronnie tries to rip the cushion on the chair. He looks ridiculous.
C: CHARLES
D: Alright, Ronnie, that's enough.
N: Ronnie stops and begins to cry. Then he runs out of the office in tears.
S: INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT
N: Ronnie lies in his bed and we... TIME LAPSE: The sun rises and sets three times through the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days have passed. The whole time, Ronnie doesn't move from his bed. Until... Ronnie gets on his "nice" clothes, but they're a far cry from his Security Guard uniform. Ronnie's Mom comes up to him.
C: MOM
D: What's on the agenda for today?
C: RONNIE
D: I guess maybe look for a job or something.
C: MOM
D: Well, I know you're sad about it, but try to look on the bright side.
C: RONNIE
D: There is no bright side. My life is over.
C: MOM
D: Ronnie, you may not be smart or handsome, but you've got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special. No matter what this world tries to throw at you, they can never take those dreams away.
C: RONNIE
D: What the fuck are you talking about, Mom?
C: MOM
D: I don't know. I'm drunk. I just know that mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when they're sad, so I tried. What do you want from me?
C: RONNIE
D: Nothing. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. I just blew my life. I tried to be a big shot, a hero and a stupid cop. I wanted to be recognized for being great. I should have just been happy where I was at. I didn't do my duty.
C: MOM
D: Ronnie, the other night when I soiled my pants right before I puked myself, I was thinking about how you would come home and find me and clean me up. I knew you would be there to find me and take care of me, so I was able to pass out on the floor and not worry. If there's one thing you know about, it's duty.
C: RONNIE
D: I do it because I love you.
C: MOM
D: I know and I love you too, Ronnie. I haven't always been easy to deal with and most people would have thrown me away a long time ago.
E: MORE
C: MOM
D: Just like your father did. But not you, Ronnie. Look, whiskey was always the way I dealt with being a single mother, but as I get older, I know that I can't keep doing this. I've got everything I need with you. So I want you to know that I'm ready to make a change. Your life needs to get easier and you don't need to take care of old Mom anymore.
E: CONT'D
C: RONNIE
D: Are you going to quit drinking?
C: MOM
D: I'm switching to beer. I can pound those all day and still keep my shit together. I'm doing it for you.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm so proud of you, Mom.
C: MOM
D: I'm proud of you. Now today is a new day and we're going to get through it. Now, get out there and find what the world has in store for you.
N: Ronnie's Mom leaves and Ronnie looks at himself in the mirror. Then something catches his eye. Ronnie sees a newspaper laying on the ground. He picks it up and reads.
S: EXT. JAIL - DAY
N: Ronnie walks up the steps that lead to the local jail.
S: INT. JAIL - DAY
N: Ronnie walks into one of those booths where you can talk to a prisoner on the opposite side of a Plexiglas divider. Ronnie sits down in wait. Then, two GUARDS appear escorting a handcuffed Dennis. Dennis takes a seat and picks up the phone.
C: DENNIS
D: What's up, Ronnie? How you doing?
C: RONNIE
D: I've been better. You?
C: DENNIS
D: I'm holding it down in here.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I heard they finally caught up with you.
C: DENNIS
D: I know. I should have hit Mexico, but, you know, I got stoned and just kind of kicked with this girl in Kannapolis for a while.
C: RONNIE
D: You know they fired me when they found out you were the one who robbed the mall.
C: DENNIS
D: Shit, dog. Sorry about that.
C: RONNIE
D: It's cool, but I need to know why you did it.
C: DENNIS
D: I told you. I'm an outlaw.
C: RONNIE
D: Come on, Dennis.
C: DENNIS
D: Man, you want to know the real reason?
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah.
C: DENNIS
D: Alright, I'll tell you. Man, that gig was one of the best jobs I ever had. I got to wear a uniform, I could smoke weed whenever I wanted. For once in my life, I felt like I was actually somebody. I know most people don't think it's shit, but I really loved it. Then, all of a sudden, I find out that your ass got promoted over me.
E: MORE
C: DENNIS
D: After all I put into it, you're the one that makes it to Head of Mall Security. You know what it's like to get passed over, Ronnie? So I got pissed off. I started robbing the joint as a way to get at them for what they did to me. But you know what, Ronnie?
E: CONT'D
C: RONNIE
D: What's that?
C: DENNIS
D: You ever love a girl so much that you can't break up with her, so the only thing you can do when she pisses you off is smack her in the goddamn face?
C: RONNIE
D: No, Dennis, I haven't.
C: DENNIS
D: Well, I have. And that's pretty much how I felt about the job.
C: RONNIE
D: Thanks for talking to me, Dennis.
C: DENNIS
D: Well, it's the least I could do after knocking you out and all.
N: Ronnie starts to hang up the phone.
C: DENNIS
D: Hey, Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, Dennis.
C: DENNIS
D: Bail me out of here, old friend.
C: RONNIE
D: I can't do it, Dennis. You're now a criminal who stopped caring, but my crime is that I care too much.
N: Ronnie hangs up the phone and walks out.
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: Ronnie comes into the mall and makes his way down the center of it, feeling naked without his uniform. Charles, now wearing a mall security uniform, comes out and stops Ronnie.
C: CHARLES
D: Ronnie, what are you doing back here?
C: RONNIE
D: I just came to talk to Nell. Don't get your panties in a wad, I'm just here as any normal patron.
C: CHARLES
D: Ronnie, dude, I've been all fucked up in the head. I feel like shit about what happened. I mean, here I am, just looking to shuck responsibility and I ended up hurting you in the process. Look, I should have been honest with you. I don't give two shits about this stupid job. But you do.
C: RONNIE
D: It's okay, Charles.
C: CHARLES
D: I've decided I'm going back to college. Getting stoned and studying beats this any day. I realize that now. I realize that there aren't any jobs where you can avoid hard choices. Anyway, take as long as you want at the mall. I'll keep Mark off your back.
C: RONNIE
D: Thanks, Charles.
S: INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
N: Ronnie sees Nell sitting down and eating a Cinnabon. Ronnie takes a seat at her table.
C: NELL
D: Ronnie, what are you doing here?
C: RONNIE
D: I got something I want to say.
C: NELL
D: I don't think we should be talking.
C: RONNIE
D: I'll be quick. Nell, this is the only job I was ever any good at. I'm not a crime solver or right hand of the law. I'm just a dumb guy in a uniform who can't even become a real policeman. Somewhere along the way I started to think I was something special, someone whose shit didn't stink, someone who deserved to date out of my league. You know, I've learned. My shit does stink. It smells horrible. And you're also out of my league, but for some reason, you like the smell of my shit. I guess what I'm saying is...
N: Ronnie reaches into his pocket and pulls out his Mother's disgusting yellow engagement ring, but for some reason, it looks beautiful.
C: RONNIE
D: If you give me another chance, I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you. And you can call me sweetie in front of people and I'll like it.
N: Nell thinks about it. She leans over the table and kisses Ronnie. Ronnie is stunned. With one kiss, Nell seems to make everything okay. They stare at each other and the moment seems to hold for an eternity. Love is in the air until... THE PERVERT STEPS IN FRONT OF THEM AND EXPOSES HIS DING- A-LING! Nell SCREAMS! The Pervert runs. Ronnie gets pissed!
C: RONNIE
D: Son of a bitch!!!
C: NELL
D: Oh, my God!
C: RONNIE
D: Are you alright?
C: NELL
D: I'm fine.
C: RONNIE
D: Shit, we should call somebody.
C: NELL
D: Ronnie.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah?
C: NELL
D: Go get him.
N: Ronnie realizes that this is his duty and his alone. Ronnie rises from the table slowly. He looks at Nell and nods acceptance. Then, Ronnie runs after the Pervert.
S: INT. MALL - DAY
N: The Pervert is in a full blown run through the mall. His trench coat is wide open and his wienie is flapping for the world to see. In a way, it's his greatest accomplishment. People scream! Mothers grab their daughters! No one is safe!
T: CUT TO:
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Ronnie comes ripping out of the food court. He's got a fierce look of determination in his eyes. He runs hard to catch up with the Perv.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANOTHER ANGLE There's a crowd surrounding the Cell Phone Kiosk. The Pervert bursts through the crowd and knocks people out of the way.
C: SADDAMN
D: What the fuck, man?!
N: Ronnie comes running up behind him.
C: RONNIE
D: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
N: The crowd totally clears a path for Ronnie, but Ronnie stops running and SUCKER PUNCHES SADDAMN. Saddamn goes down hard and Ronnie rejoins the chase.
C: RONNIE
D: Stay the fuck away from my wife!
T: CUT TO:
N: THE PERVERT runs past the skaters, who are hanging out on a bench.
C: STEVIE
D: Dude, that's fucking disgusting!
N: Ronnie comes running way far behind.
C: STEVIE
D: Hey, Ronnie, here!
N: Stevie slides his skateboard out for Ronnie to jump on. Ronnie jumps like he is going to land on the skateboard and sail to the finish line. However, when Ronnie's feet touch the board, it goes shooting out from under him. Ronnie slams onto the ground. All of the skaters start laughing.
C: STEVIE
D: What a fucking douche!
N: Ronnie picks himself up and starts to run again. He only makes it a little ways before he hits something slippery. Ronnie falls onto the ground and cracks his head. Ronnie lays on the ground and sees Ramon laughing against a wall with a mop in his hands.
C: RONNIE
D: Okay, Ramon, we're fucking even!
N: Ronnie picks himself up and starts running again.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE PERVERT runs past VICTORIA'S SECRET. He stops at the doorway and as if he can't resist, flashes the ladies in the store. He takes off running again.
T: CUT TO:
N: RONNIE as he runs by the RECORD STORE, which of course is BLASTING MUSIC. Ronnie stops at the doorway.
C: RONNIE
D: Turn it down. Turn it down.
N: The Record Store guy turns the MUSIC DOWN. Ronnie goes back to his chase.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE PERVERT runs past Mark. He looks around at all the people staring.
C: MARK
D: Okay, show's over. Enjoy your shopping experience at Carolina Mall.
N: Ronnie runs past Mark.
C: MARK
D: Jesus. Charles!
E: calling out
N: Charles comes running up.
C: CHARLES
D: What is it?
C: MARK
D: Call the police. And go get Ronnie.
C: CHARLES
D: He's trying to help.
C: MARK
D: Just do what I ask you.
N: Charles runs after them. Ronnie sees Charles coming and runs faster. Charles is moving in on him.
C: CHARLES
D: Hey, Ronnie!
N: Ronnie turns around to see Charles as he flings him a giant flashlight. Ronnie catches it.
C: RONNIE
D: Fuck yeah!
N: Ronnie starts running again, but this time, he's a little more together.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE PERVERT has made his way through the whole mall at this point, but Ronnie is right on his ass. The Pervert is heading toward the DEPARTMENT STORE.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: The Pervert comes barreling in and the ladies at the perfume and make-up counters SCREAM. He looks like he's charging straight at Brandi. He's getting closer. BOOM! Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the Pervert with the flashlight. Ronnie jumps on top of the Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him. This is a vision of a man leaving all out on the field. Ronnie stops pounding and looks up. He sees Brandi staring at him. Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on the Pervert harder than ever before. Finally, Charles comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him. A huge crowd has gathered around. Ronnie has blood all over him.

D: You had an eyelash?

C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Okay, we rolling?
C: CAMERAMAN
D: Rolling.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Good evening. We're here today with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall. Last week, Ronnie was able to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER single-handed and bring him to justice. Ronnie, how did you manage to find the identity of The Pervert and take him down?
C: RONNIE
D: Well, being a mall security guard basically requires the same skill set that someone in say the FBI has. You have to use logic and evidence and old-fashioned common sense as well as the latest technology to deduce the criminal mind. It's what I do.
N: All of a sudden, STEVIE AND THE SKATERS come up behind Ronnie. They look into the camera lens and start smiling. Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to focus on the reporter.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: Any last words for the folks at home.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah, I'd just like to say that Carolina Mall is back on track and safer than ever...
N: The Skaters start flipping off the camera. Ronnie keeps getting distracted.

D: In fact, there are some wonderful sales taking place right now.
N: Stevie walks up behind Ronnie and pretends to hump him.
C: RONNIE
D: So for all you families out there, come on down and see us. It's a wonderful place.
N: Ronnie turns around angrily.
C: RONNIE
D: THAT'S IT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!
N: THE SKATERS jump on their skateboards and skate off. Ronnie runs after them. He jumps into his GOLF CART and gives chase. The NEWS CAMERA is still rolling. The FEMALE REPORTER looks into the lens.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: You heard it, folks. Everything is back to normal here at Carolina Mall. Back to you, Lindsay.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: THE END
