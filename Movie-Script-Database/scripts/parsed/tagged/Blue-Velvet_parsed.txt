N: CLOSER ON WATER DROPLETS. The water droplets are somewhat abstracted as they dance in the light. PAN DOWN now to the green grass, traveling along the grass. The MUSIC becomes fainter as we MOVE SUDDENLY under the grass, now as if in a dark forest. SLOWLY MOVING THROUGH. The grass is like great timbers. It is GETTING DARKER and ominous SOUNDS come up as we discover black insects crawling and scratching in the darkness.

N: MR. BEAUMONT is watering flowers and grass with the hose. He is dressed in khaki trousers, canvas shoes, old white shirt, straw hat and dark glasses. CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT watches his watering, then looks up. The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses. He moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin in the process. He's thinking about who knows what. He looks back down at his lawn. CLOSEUP - WATER ON GRASS The water hits the grass and mats it down. WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it. Water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a LOUD HISSING NOISE of water under pressure. CLOSEUP - KINK IN HOSE Loud HISSING NOISE. Mr. Beaumont goes around the bush and is undoing the kink when he is suddenly hit with a tremendous seizure. CLOSEUP - MR. BEAUMONT He's doubling over and falls to the ground.

He holds a large red popsicle. Gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show. He holds his hand out to get it wet in the spray. This makes him screw up his face in a laugh.

He gathers up a few more rocks and pitches them one by one at the bottle. He misses. He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange. He looks closer. It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants. Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around. All he sees are houses - some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene. No one seems to be around - No one seems to be watching him. He looks again at the ear. We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it. There is dried blood on part of it. Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto it. Again, he stands up and looks around. IN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house. Nothing more.

D: I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
C: SANDY
D: That's too bad.
C: JEFFREY
D: What do you know about the ear?. anything?
C: SANDY
D: Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
E: she smiles
C: JEFFREY
D: Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
C: SANDY
D: I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
C: JEFFREY
D: Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
C: SANDY
D: There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
C: JEFFREY
D: Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
C: SANDY
D: No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
C: JEFFREY
D: The ear is from a missing person maybe?
C: SANDY
D: Maybe so.
C: JEFFREY
D: It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
C: SANDY
D: Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
C: JEFFREY
D: I guess you have to get back home soon?
C: SANDY
D: Not really, why? You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
E: then she understands

C: SANDY
D: Still, it must be kinda rough.

C: JEFFREY
D: I guess I'll see you sometime.
E: continuing
C: SANDY
D: I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
C: JEFFREY
D: Yeah. Good bye.
E: smiles
N: Jeffrey watches as Sandy goes inside her house. He watches her house for a moment and sees her cross the living room. He turns and walks away. Again, the MYSTERIOUS CHORDS OF MUSIC swell up as Jeffrey walks through the night.

N: Ed peers into the back room. Spots Jeffrey.

They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey. He starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls up alongside of them. very close. Sandy suddenly recognizes him.
C: JEFFREY
D: You hungry or thirsty, or both?
C: SANDY
D: I don't know.
E: taken back
C: JEFFREY
D: I'd like to talk to you about something.
C: SANDY

C: SANDY
D: Please, don't say anything to Mike. promise?
E: to the girls
N: The girls promise. Sandy goes around and gets in the car.
C: JEFFREY
D: I don't want to cause any trouble.

N: Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in a booth. Jeffrey's grilled cheese on white bread and a coke have just arrived along with Sandy's coke.
C: SANDY
D: Alright, now tell me. What is it?
C: JEFFREY
D: There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
C: SANDY
D: You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
C: JEFFREY
D: Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
C: SANDY
D: It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
E: thinking and intrigued, plus she is beginning to like Jeffrey
C: JEFFREY
D: Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
E: getting excited
C: SANDY
D: Now, how are you going to do that?
C: JEFFREY
D: Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
C: SANDY
D: What will I say when she comes to the door?
C: JEFFREY
D: You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
C: SANDY
D: I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
C: JEFFREY
D: Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
C: SANDY
D: You've got a point there.
T: CUT TO:
S: 63. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET-DAY
N: Jeffrey and Sandy are in the car. Jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls.
C: JEFFREY

C: SANDY
D: Alright.
C: JEFFREY
D: Let's go.
S: 64. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

C: JEFFREY
D: That's a good sign.
E: to himself
N: He keeps climbing. He arrives at the Seventh Floor. and finds Number 710. He knocks and waits. He looks around. the hallway is empty. DOROTHY VALLENS opens the door. She is a very beautiful woman in her late thirties. She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick wavy hair. Full red lips. Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe.
C: DOROTHY
D: Yes? What is it?
C: JEFFREY
D: Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
C: DOROTHY
D: Oh God, that stuff stinks.
C: JEFFREY
D: Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
E: as he goes in
C: DOROTHY
D: Oh yeah, that's good.
S: 68. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying. All the while he's getting a good look around the apartment. There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape. Jeffrey looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying. The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed. Suddenly, there is knocking at the door.
C: DOROTHY
D: What is this. Grand Central Station?
N: She opens the door. Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow sports coat, is standing there. Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN looked around Dorothy to see him. Dorothy says something to the Man which Jeffrey cannot hear. The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone. The whole thing looks to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter. On a long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. He wraps things up and gets out.
C: JEFFREY
D: That oughta do it.
E: to Dorothy
C: DOROTHY
D: Yeah.
S: 69. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

N: As they go downstairs,
C: SANDY
D: I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
C: SANDY
D: No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
C: JEFFREY
D: I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh?
E: he shows it to her
C: SANDY
D: Yeah, if it opens the door.
C: JEFFREY
D: Yeah.

D: You go first.
S: 71. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

D: So. what's next?
C: JEFFREY
D: Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
C: SANDY

N: They pull up in front of Sandy's house.
C: SANDY
D: I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?

D: What's the plan.
C: JEFFREY
D: First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.

D: Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady. Miss Dorothy Vallens.
E: very low key
N: There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue laughing, talking, and drinking. Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage. She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of the song. During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into. Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET." They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.

N: They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop close to the building. Jeffery cuts the engine. It is very quiet. Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or watching. Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the Seventh Floor. It is dark. Sandy moves. Every tiny sound is heard. Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.
C: SANDY
D: Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
C: JEFFREY
D: Why not?
C: SANDY
D: It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.

D: It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
C: SANDY
D: Yeah. but.

D: That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
C: SANDY
D: Okay, okay. Bye.
N: Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door. He looks in one more time at Sandy. They stare at each other silently. Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car. Sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building. She slides over and sits in the driver's seat.
T: CUT TO:
S: 81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor. SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor. He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until the man goes downstairs. Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710. He takes out the key and looks around. No one. He inserts the key. It fits. He turns it. The door opens.
S: 82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door. It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness. Soon he finds his way around. He decides on the closet to hide in. However before he goes in to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the darkness. He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom. Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty child's room. In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a propeller on top. The kind that plays music when the propeller turns. The hat is sitting silently on the bed post. He quietly closes the door. He returns to the closet. Once inside, he checks out how much he can see. Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment. This is where he will stay. He moves around some to relax. He takes several deep breaths. He looks at his watch. It says "10:17."
S: 83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
N: Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and street.
S: 84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to stretch his muscles which are getting tired. Again, he takes several deep breaths. He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.
C: JEFFREY
D: Oh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on!. and I gotta pee. Great. it's now or never.
E: to himself
N: Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to the door of the bathroom. His foot hits the door and it makes a loud noise. He freezes.
S: 85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: He moves again into the bathroom. He starts to pee.

S: 88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.
S: 89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
N: Sandy begins to honk the horn.
S: 90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom as the tank is still filling. SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door. He bolts toward the closet. He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front door opens. Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.
C: DOROTHY
D: Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a drink, or something?
E: V.O. we're watching Jeffrey trying to control frightened breathing in the dark closet
C: JIMMY
D: I better get back. thanks anyway.
E: V.O.
C: DOROTHY
D: Goodnight.
C: JIMMY
D: Goodnight now.
N: The front door shuts and the living room lights go on. Jeffrey can see Dorothy come toward him. She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when the phone RINGS. She turns immediately and goes to answer it. Jeffrey almost passes out. He thought he'd had it. He overhears.
C: DOROTHY
D: Hello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me talk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like to sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay. Don't worry. Don??. can you hear me? Is little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You mean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the matter with him? I know. When? Okay. In an hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you. Okay Frank, sir.
E: on the phone
N: She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.
C: DOROTHY
D: Frank, you son of a bitch!
E: to herself
N: She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail. She nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch. She puts on a record, "FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE." She sits back down and chews her nail again, listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry. She stops herself and takes the record off. She starts taking off her stocking. She then takes off her dress. Underneath, she has on a bra and panties. She crosses the living room, goes down the hallway into the bathroom. Jeffrey can't see her too well now. She takes off her panties in the bathroom. She is now naked. She looks at herself in the mirror. We see Jeffrey's face as he watches her. She disappears from view completely and we HEAR her start a SHOWER.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey's face. He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again. He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can. She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe. She doesn't see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden. She closes the door. It CLICKS shut. Jeffrey is in almost total darkness. He listens. He can HEAR WALKING around, then silence. He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING. He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN. Now he can see her. She sits down on her bed. She looks up. Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight. She looks at the closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it. She slowly gets up. Jeffrey doesn't know what is up. He looks but she walks out of view. SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him. When she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.
C: DOROTHY

C: JEFFREY
D: Well.
C: DOROTHY
D: THEN WHAT?

C: DOROTHY
D: NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
C: JEFFREY
D: Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
C: DOROTHY
D: No way.
N: Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife. She goes to Jeffrey. Now she has a knife and a gun. He's scared.
C: DOROTHY
D: Get undressed. I want to see you.
N: Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, Then his shirt. He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off. Now he is only in his underwear.
C: DOROTHY
D: STAND UP.
N: He does.
C: DOROTHY
D: Come closer.
E: continuing
N: Dorothy has a strange look on her face. She reaches out and pulls Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees. She looks at him.
C: DOROTHY
D: What do you want from me?
E: whispering
C: JEFFREY
D: I . I don't know.
E: quietly, getting very hot
C: DOROTHY
D: What do you want?
E: whispering
N: Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice. She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.
C: DOROTHY
D: Don't move. don't look at me.
N: Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.
C: DOROTHY
D: Do you like that?
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes.
N: He tries to touch her.
C: DOROTHY
D: Don't move or I'll kill you.
N: She looks at him.
C: DOROTHY
D: Do you like talk like that?
E: continuing
C: JEFFREY
D: No.
C: DOROTHY
D: Lie down on the bed.
N: He lies down. He looks frightened. There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door. Dorothy looks VERY frightened. She quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to Jeffrey.
C: DOROTHY
D: Shut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't say anything or you'll get killed. I mean it.
E: whispers, frantic
N: KNOCKING is heard louder at the door. Jeffrey picks up all his clothes and gets in the closet. He's naked and hiding in the closet. Dorothy closes her robe and glides to the front door. Jeffrey sees FRANK come in. Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut. He is wearing a tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket. He's got on a pair of blue jeans and boots. He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go off" - presence. He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy. He sits on the couch.
C: DOROTHY
D: Hello, baby.
C: FRANK
D: Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
E: annoyed, condescending
C: DOROTHY
D: Hello, daddy.
C: FRANK
D: . my bourbon.
E: can't-you-remember- anything-attitude
N: Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink. As she passes the closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face. She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank. Frank sips on it.
C: FRANK
D: . sit down. get your chair.
N: Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down. She adjusts her robe.
C: FRANK
D: . spread your legs.
E: studying her
N: Dorothy slowly spreads her legs. She can see Jeffrey staring out of the darkness of the closet at her.
C: FRANK
D: wider.
N: She opens her legs wider. Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his bourbon. He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at Dorothy, her body - her crotch. Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting. Frank suddenly reaches to his belt, where he has a small canister and a mask. He opens a valve on the canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth. The canister is filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange sounding. The result is frightening.
C: FRANK
D: . mommy.
E: high voice
N: Dorothy jumps. She keeps looking at the ceiling.
C: FRANK
D: . MOMMY!.
E: continuing, with high voice
C: DOROTHY
D: . mommy's here.
E: frightened
C: FRANK
D: Baby wants to fuck.
E: high voice
N: Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.
C: FRANK
D: GET READY TO FUCK!
E: normal voice, but loud - like an army order to himself
N: Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her. He takes one more gasp of helium.
C: FRANK
D: Baby wants blue velvet.
E: high voice
N: Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.
C: DOROTHY
D: Okay.
E: whispering
N: Frank slowly moves Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the texture of the velvet. His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body underneath. His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the velvet robe. Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear. Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug. He warns her.
C: FRANK
D: Don't look at me!
N: He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth. Then, he pushes her arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way. Frank sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way. Dorothy is moaning. Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.
C: FRANK
D: Don't look at me!!! Daddy's home.
E: heavy breathing
N: He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy. He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him. Faster and faster, then he has a climax in his pants. Dorothy's head is falling back. She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet. Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.
C: FRANK
D: Don't look at me!!!
E: screaming
N: He slugs her in the face. His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from deep within him. On his hands and knees, he moves away. The robe pulls out of his mouth. His breathing is even heavier now. He stands and begins to move around the apartment. He goes to a wall, turns off the lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying. Dorothy moans softly. It gets very quiet and still for a moment. Then, Jeffrey hears Frank with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom. The high, strange sound reverberates in the distance. Jeffrey can't make it out - soon, he hears Frank's high laughing. Frank comes back into the living room. The mask is around his face. All his breathing - every sound is high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.
C: FRANK
D: Stay alive baby. See you next Christmas!
N: Frank leaves and shuts the door. The apartment is silent except for Dorothy's moans. Jeffrey is stunned. He doesn't move. He watches Dorothy in the half-light. She rolls over and starts crying. The crying is deep and genuine. Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her. He bends down and touches her. She flinches and turns to see him. She turns back sobbing. He tries to get her up.
C: JEFFREY
D: Why don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll help you.
N: She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed. She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall. He covers her with the sheet.
C: DOROTHY
D: Don't. I don't like that. What do you want?
E: referring to the sheet
C: JEFFREY
D: Nothing. Are you alright?
C: DOROTHY
D: Sure I'm alright.
E: she starts crying again
C: JEFFREY
D: I'll go then.
N: He starts to put on his underwear. They're inside out. He tries to turn them around.
C: DOROTHY
D: Don?
C: JEFFREY
D: No.
C: DOROTHY
D: Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
N: Jeffrey turns to her. He studies her. He reaches out and takes her shoulders. He moves down and holds her.
C: DOROTHY
D: Thank you. honey.
E: whispering
C: JEFFREY
D: It's okay. It's okay.
E: whispering
N: They lie together for a long silent moment.
C: DOROTHY
D: Do you like the way I feel?
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes.
E: hesitates
C: DOROTHY
D: See my breasts? . See?
N: Jeffrey looks.
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes.
C: DOROTHY
D: See my nipples?
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes.
C: DOROTHY
D: You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
E: whispering
N: Jeffrey starts to move closer. Dorothy closes her eyes.
C: DOROTHY
D: Go ahead. I don't mind.
E: continuing
N: Jeffrey can't help himself. He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her breasts. They both are getting very hot.
C: DOROTHY
D: Feel me.
N: Jeffrey is all over her now. Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.
C: DOROTHY
D: You can hit me, if you want to.
C: JEFFREY
D: No. please. I won't.
N: Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the wall.
C: JEFFREY
D: Stop it!
N: She moves and won't let him feel her anymore. She holds his hands away.
C: DOROTHY
D: Do you like me?
E: whispering
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes, I like you.
E: whispering
C: DOROTHY
D: You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
E: whispering
N: They start making love. Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.
C: JEFFREY
D: What's the matter?
N: Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.
C: DOROTHY
D: Get off me.
N: Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face. Dorothy goes into the bathroom crying all the way. Jeffrey sits, confused. Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy. A true scream of horror. He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.
S: 92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: She is just flushing something down the toilet. The water SOUND rushes. He turns to her. She is trembling and in a state of shock.
C: DOROTHY
D: I made it go down the toilet.
C: JEFFREY
D: What?
N: He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and around then whatever it is disappears.
C: DOROTHY
D: I made it go down the toilet.
N: Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down" on the mirror. He looks down into the sink. At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood and a smear of fresher blood. Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating in the bathroom.
S: 93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: FLASHBACK Frank in bathroom.
S: 94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

E: inner voice out loud, to Dorothy
C: DOROTHY
D: Do you know?
E: strangely - extremely frightened now that Jeffrey may have left it
C: JEFFREY
D: No.
C: DOROTHY
D: You don't?
E: breathing heavily, strangely
C: JEFFREY
D: No. What is happening?
C: DOROTHY
D: Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
C: JEFFREY
D: Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
C: DOROTHY
D: Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
C: JEFFREY
D: Then don't talk about killing.
C: DOROTHY
D: Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die.
E: laughs strange smile she leans close
C: JEFFREY
D: Don't say that.
C: DOROTHY
D: It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
C: JEFFREY
D: O.K.
E: frightened by her craziness
N: He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink. He takes another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and turns, goes through the hall to the living room. He crosses slowly to the door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the bathroom. He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him. She stares into the sink. Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe
C: JEFFREY
D: I'm leaving now.
N: She is whispering something to herself.
C: DOROTHY
D: Help me. help me. please help me.
E: very faint whisper
N: Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.
S: 96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room. He looks around and sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's. Suddenly he remembers the photograph that Dorothy hid. He picks up the pillow and sees a picture of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed hat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage license. It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.
C: JEFFREY
D: Don. Oh my God.
E: V.O.
N: He hides the photo again. He sees Dorothy's telephone. He memorizes the number - moving his lips with each digit. He goes to the front door and opens it quietly.
S: 97. EXT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: He looks out into the hall. It's empty.
S: 97A. INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

S: 98. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
N: . and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk. He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths. He looks at his watch. 2:30. He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy. He secretly worries about what he's gotten into.

S: 101. INT. BEAUMONTS' HARDWARE STORE - DAY
N: Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store. He thinks. He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down. He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.

E: V.O.
C: DR. GYNDE
D: Yes.

C: JEFFREY
D: I'll have an ice-cold Heineken.
C: MAITRE D'
D: One Heineken, certainly, sir.
N: Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves. It is very dark and smoky inside. He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing. They are sitting two tables away. Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious- looking. He looks right up to her eyes. In his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers. Again her first number, "BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET." This song she sings mainly to Frank. When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly. Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.
S: EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

N: Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the SLOW CLUB. Among them are Frank and his friends.

He has to gun the car up to sixty-five to catch up with them.
S: 107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
N: The mysterious MUSIC plays. He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right. He waits at a light right behind them. Inside they are lighting cigarettes.

S: 108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT
N: Dark, low MUSIC now. Up ahead, Frank parks his car. Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his lights and engine. He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment building next to a bookbinding factory. They disappear within. The electric lines above buzz loudly. Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street. He reaches Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down. He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it down in his notebook. He continues on to the apartment building.
S: 109. INT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes. He sees a name - Frank Booth. The name gives him the chills. The apartment number is 26. In the distance, he hears footsteps. He quickly leaves.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 114. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

E: thinking out loud

N: Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door. She holds her head collecting her fragile self. Dorothy goes to the door and opens it. It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple sports coat and light blue double knit pants. His eyes are glazed and his face is broken out in a sweat.

C: JEFFREY
D: Nice guy. Who's he?
E: talking softly
C: DOROTHY
D: Who's it, you mean.
N: SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry. Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him. She starts sobbing again.

N: The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full moon. The wind continues to moan. They move to the roof top and Dorothy leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building. A very sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the wind.

D: No.

C: DOROTHY

C: DOROTHY
D: Please. please stay.
N: She makes him kiss her. he really likes it. Once again, Jeffrey and Dorothy get VERY HOT. Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof. Dorothy cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the roof.
C: JEFFREY
D: Why Dorothy?
N: We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it.
C: DOROTHY
D: Don? I have to make it hurt. I want there to be nothing again. Don!!!
E: as she slams her head again and again
N: She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish kiss. Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.
T: FADE TO WHITE: FADE DOWN TO:
S: 121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into darkness. He continues down the sidewalk. He looks up at the starry sky. The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: 121A. Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face. He is trying to speak. He's trying to say "Jeffrey." 121B. Another dark image appears. A robin sits in a tree at night. Very close. There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound. 121C. Now Dorothy's apartment building at night. A very low angle looking up to the roof. Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from the roof. It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is a red high-heeled shoe. As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of Dorothy's which open into a scream. 121D. Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.
S: 122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room.
C: JEFFREY
D: Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
C: AUNT BARBARA
D: Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
C: JEFFREY
D: Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
C: AUNT BARBARA
D: I've seen a few.
C: JEFFREY
D: Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
C: AUNT BARBARA
D: Okay honey.
N: Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls. She moves into a dark area and taps. Something falls. She reaches down. In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick carpet. Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look. She looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls. We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.
T: CUT TO:
S: 123. INT. WILLIAMS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: They all sit around the dining room table. They have their heads bowed in a prayer before dinner.
C: SANDY

N: They start passing food around.
C: MIKE
D: Like I was saying. if you toss the ball like this, with your fingers just down here, that thing'll spin like a beauty. real straight.

D: Well.
C: MIKE
D: I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.

C: JEFFREY
D: No. you're right.
E: not offended
C: MIKE
D: I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
C: JEFFREY
D: Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
C: MIKE
D: Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
E: not getting any humor
C: MRS. WILLIAMS
D: No, Mike. but there are vitamins in the food, you know.
N: Everyone laughs.
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta take a bunch of zinc too. The body is like a machine. EVERYTHING has got to stay in perfect tune for perfect health. That's what I'm interested in.
N: Sandy looks at Mike.
C: MIKE
D: Oh yeah. and a few other things.
N: Everyone laughs again.

C: JEFFREY
D: That sounds great!
C: MRS. WILLIAMS

N: Mrs. Williams goes back upstairs. Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their dessert. Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie. Mike stands up.
C: MIKE
D: I'll be right back.
N: He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs. Once around the corner he stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another.
C: SANDY
D: Well, how did it go?. What happened?
C: JEFFREY
D: Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.

N: Mike starts upstairs.
C: MIKE
D: Yes.
E: mumbling
N: Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by. Mrs. Williams and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement. She throws Sandy a concerned look. Just then, Mike calls downstairs.

D: Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
C: MRS. WILLIAMS

C: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS

N: Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study.
C: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
D: Take a look at these. These are the photos of the vacant lot where you found the ear. You might find them interesting.
E: continuing
N: Jeffrey begins going through the pictures. They are 8 X 10 black and white prints. Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite beautiful in an abstract way. As he goes through them.
C: JEFFREY
D: These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
C: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
D: Okay.
C: JEFFREY
D: Anything you can tell me?
C: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
D: The criminals are winning.

C: JEFFREY
D: I guess you've seen some bad things.
C: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
D: Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
C: JEFFREY
D: Why do you do it?
C: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
D: I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
C: JEFFREY
D: Yeah. I get it.
N: Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos. A piece of cloth in the grass. Carefully he asks.
C: JEFFREY
D: What is this? What color is it?
C: DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
D: Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
E: leaning over to see
N: Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset. Detective Williams puts the photos away.

S: 128. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/CHURCH - NIGHT
N: Sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church. The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night.
C: SANDY
D: You want to tell me about it?
C: JEFFREY
D: . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
C: SANDY
D: Wow. Should you tell my father?
E: quietly
C: JEFFREY
D: I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.

C: JEFFREY
D: That doesn't bother you, does it?
E: a searching, slight smile
C: SANDY
D: Who, me? Why should it?
C: JEFFREY
D: That's what I thought.
E: seeing some jealousy and and happy for it
C: SANDY
D: You're sure right. It is a strange world.
C: JEFFREY
D: Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
C: SANDY
D: I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you. . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
E: she reflects silently on this before proceeding
C: JEFFREY
D: Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.
E: he turns to her
C: SANDY
D: So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.

C: SANDY
D: You better not, Jeffrey.
E: pauses, trembling
C: JEFFREY
D: Okay. okay.

D: See ya tomorrow.
N: Sandy slowly drives off. Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes inside his house.
S: 131. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The house is very dark and quiet. Jeffrey finds a note by the one table light is on. The note is from his mother. It reads, "Jeffrey hope you enjoyed yourself. See you at breakfast. Love Mom." A postscript is written on the note by Aunt Barbara. "Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt Barbara." Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites. He picks one up and studies it. Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite in the half-light. Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.
S: 132. INT. JEFFREY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey paces nervously. He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers he dials Dorothy's number. There is a "click" but no one speaks. Jeffrey instinctively speaks.

E: to himself
S: 133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY
N: Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of Frank Booth's apartment building. The camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box. Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching. A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps. Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures. We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps. Jeffrey shoots, but really only gets the back of the man.
C: JEFFREY
D: Damn!
N: He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY
N: Later in the day. Jeffrey sits waiting. He looks at his watch. It says As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the Yellow Man. They head for Frank's building.

N: Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00.

N: Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera. He starts shooting as TWO MEN come out the door. It is the Yellow Man and a man who is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache. He carries an alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED. Both are talking together and now laughing. Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to cover the camera as they approach. The box falls. The Yellow Man looks, but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the glove compartment. The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his. Jeffrey decides to follow them. He waits a few seconds and starts off.
S: 136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
N: They drive through town. 137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY . to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building. Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them. At a metal landing they stop. He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance. The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees. He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder. Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point. He looks at his watch. "3:25".
C: JEFFREY
D: You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll.
N: He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase.

S: 139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY
N: He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars. He walks closer. Through the crowd he sees a broken window. Hanging in the window is a dead man. Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head. On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock. Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head in horrible positions. Jeffrey stands next to two black guys. Suddenly one of the police officers start pushing everyone away. Jeffrey turns to them.
C: JEFFREY
D: What happened?
N: GUY #1 He was blown away man. can't you see? GUY #2 That cracker was the biggest dealer in this section of the city, brother. the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe. It's a speedball heaven in there.

S: 144. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Dorothy closes the door. She chains it. They kiss. The kiss gets hotter. The feeling begins. They move down the hall to the back bedroom. They've never made love there. As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat with the propeller. He picks it up and spins the propeller. It makes a bit of music. Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller. She gains some control of herself. Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand.

C: JEFFREY
D: Oh God. are you alright.
N: She falls on him and smothers him with kisses.
C: DOROTHY
D: See. see how you hurt me? Now. Open me. enter me.
N: Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness. We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it.
C: DOROTHY
D: I love you Don with all my heart.
C: JEFFREY
D: No. it's not Don.
N: But he can't stop himself or her from making love.

S: 210. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs. His shoes squashing the carpet make mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building. He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops. A high-pitched whine can be heard faintly. It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment door. He gets his key out and inserts it. Turns it. With a loud click the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing. He sees something and jumps back.
S: 211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room. FLASHBACK He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again. CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON Something is wrong with him. He is bleeding from the head. He stands almost motionless. in shock. Jeffrey peers into the room again. He enters carefully and lets the door close behind him. He very cautiously moves forward into the room. Slowly he moves closer to a hideous sight. Standing in the middle of Dorothy's apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man. He is in an extreme state of shock. He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head. His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see. Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head. A bullet hole in the center of his forehead. The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine. Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall. The high whine stops instantly. Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing. Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket. Jeffrey's heart leaps and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light. Jeffrey's heart goes wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and motionless again. The radio talks again. RADIO VOICE #1 Get back and stay down. RADIO VOICE #2 . It's apartment eight. Music. LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART. begins to play. Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio.

Special police marksmen are crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building. Screams are heard from within and police radios blare. Shots are being fired into a black window. Once in a while a shot is returned. Two policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance. POLICEMAN #1 He hasn't fired a shot for six minutes. maybe we got him. get on the radio. get Detective Williams. ask him if we can rush the son of a bitch.

It is Frank, underneath a very good disguise. Jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket. He fumbles with it and it drops to the floor. Frank climbs the stairs. Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door. He rushes into the room.
S: 220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again. He rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket. He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he crouches down behind a double bed.

S: 222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room. He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and enters. Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet. Frank is smiling.
C: FRANK
D: Hey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot I have a police radio. I know where your cute little butt is hiding. Here I come! Ready or not!
E: calling pleasantly in the direction of the back bedroom
N: He starts down the hall to the back bedroom. The police radio which Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting. Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.
C: FRANK
D: Hey fuck. I can hear you radio! .Hey you stupid fuck. you got about a second to live.
N: Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun. He watches Frank sneak to the back bedroom area. Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow Man. He gets an idea. He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun. It's there. He gets it but it causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm. Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath. Just then he hears Frank in the back room.
C: FRANK
D: Hey pretty pretty.
E: V.O. helium voice
N: Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a pistol with a silencer attached.
C: FRANK
D: Hey fuck, where are you?
E: V.O.
N: Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come slowly up the hall - directly toward him. Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly. Frank enters the living room. He looks around. The Yellow Man moans. Frank makes a face and blasts the remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls dead to the floor. Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air. Frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room. He looks at the closet. He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling. Jeffrey points the pistol. His finger moves to the trigger. He squints his eyes. He doesn't want to kill a man. any man. Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.
C: SANDY

Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.

N: A huge low roaring sound comes in. SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an ear but still among the crevices. They look enormous. We move up and float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye. Jeffrey's eye. His face is bathed in light. All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard. We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance. The sprinkler is turning. Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.
C: SANDY
D: Jeffrey. Lunch is ready.
N: Jeffrey opens his eyes. He looks around confused for a moment. He sees Sandy.
C: JEFFREY
D: Okay. I'll be right in.
N: Sandy goes back inside. Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above. Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree. The Robin and Jeffrey seems to exchange a special look. Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird. He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of the house. As he passes his father and Detective Williams:
C: JEFFREY
D: How ya doin' Dad?

N: A songbird SINGS in a tree. We are in a beautiful park. Slowly we move down and a little hat with a propeller comes into view. The hat is on the head of a small child who is dancing slowly toward Dorothy. She is laughing. When the boy gets within arms reach they embrace. We move close to Dorothy's smiling face. Tears of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song. "and I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears." Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image. THE END
