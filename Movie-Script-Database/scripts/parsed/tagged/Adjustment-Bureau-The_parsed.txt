N: The sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside, and hearing the crowd through a window or door. FADE IN ON:
S: INT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY
N: DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down, thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and confident. Content. Completely in his element. In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:
C: VOICE ON PA SYSTEM
D: Thank you so much for coming today-- A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.
C: BLUE BLAZER
D: Congressman Norris-? Now REVEAL that we're Â±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad out front. "Norris for Senate" placards everywhere.
C: BLUE-BLAZER
D: Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've never seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle. CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--.
C: CHARLIE
D: Just wait 'till you see how they respond to him.. David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.
C: DAVID
D: Don't build me up like that, Charlie. He'll be disappointed.
S: EXT. ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY -- MAIN QUAD -- DAY
N: The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of the Admin Building.
C: DAVID
D: Hi there. I'm David Norris. And I'm running for the US Senate.
N: 2/12/09 2. The crowd goes wild. MONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation. The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing ovation. --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning. --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby. --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin redevelopment of an old military base upstate. --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to follow him. Especially young people. --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it. --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie stands nearby watching him speak:.
S: INT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK
N: David enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly with the noisy energy of the campaign trail. He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him. He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and meetings across the state. He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open Space Initiative. DAVID (TESTING HIMSELF) Karen Woods, founder. Husband: Bob. 2/12/09 3.
C: DAVID
D: Kids: Samantha, painting, and Ricky, Little League. John Pascal. Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two year old: Loyita... He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days out.
E: CONT'D
N: DAVID (MORE TESTING) Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan Sabovic, Jim Vargas... His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning. He doesn't need to review. It's already all there. He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks out at the trees. The silence back...it's deafening.
S: INT. SHERATON LOBBY -- UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT
N: Charlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David, holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him aside.
C: CHARLIE
D: What the hell? What happened to "I'm going to have softie tea, rest my voice, and go to bed early?" You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four AM for us to make it in time. David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand he picks up a cup and saucer.
C: DAVID
D: I had some tea. (sees Charlie's not in the
C: MOOD)
D: Come on, man. We're eight points up in the polls. I've gotta cut loose every once in a while and have a life. This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like having a life to him...
N: 2/12/09 4.
C: CHARLIE
D: Ten.
C: DAVID
D: What?
C: CHARLIE
D: Latest poll has you ten points up. A slow smile spreads across David's face.
T: CUT TO:
C: BLACK SCREEN
D: The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder:
C: CAMPAIGN AIDE.
D: County reporting: 8901 for Lynfield, 7233 for Norris.
S: INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT
N: Charlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that. She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county. CHARLIE (NATURAL OPTIMIST) Better than I thought, I thought we'd get killed in Seneca. He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops.
C: CHARLIE
D: Eddie, call Boyd! Where the hell are the. Suffolk numbers? We've got to get the Suffolk numbers!
S: EXT. ROOFTOP NEAR WALDORF -- NIGHT
N: A light snow falls. Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS, overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story building. Their clothing is more timeless than old- fashioned. And somehow so is their demeanor. The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost- as if it's their domain. 2/12/09 5.
S: INT. WALDORF HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
N: David watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already called for David's opponent. PUNDIT #1 Congressman Norris has a reputation for being very direct, even blunt, in his campaign speeches, which is great until you say too many things you wish you hadn't. Then you start to look like an amateur. PUNDIT #2 That's bad for any candidate but it's fatal if you're running for Senate at the age of 33, your opponent keeps calling you an "impulsive kid," and you almost killed your entire political career five months ago with an act of immaturity that ended up on the front page of`.the New York Post. David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through the open door behind him.
C: -CHARLIE
D: Why are you still watching CNN? They called this way too early. David doesn't share his friend's optimism.
S: INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE'-- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT
N: A' campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room:
C: AIDE
D: Suffolk County Numbers! Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen.
C: AIDE
D: Lynfield: 415,120. Norris:
E: O.S.
N: Charlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly.
C: CHARLIE
D: I really thought we'd win Suffolk.
E: after long beat
N: 2/12/09 6. A senior aide walks over.
C: SENIOR AIDE
D: Kings County just came in too.
C: A BRUTAL
D: He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David. beat...
C: DAVID
D: Well, it's over. And it's going to be a blowout... David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going to lose big. It's going to be a grand,. public humiliation.
C: SENIOR AIDE
D: NBC has us up next. Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC.
C: BRIAN WILLIAMS
D: Turning now to the New York Senate race, NBC is now calling the election for Roger'Lynfield. After a shockingly poor showing in both Suffolk county and in his home county, Kings, it now appears that David Norris will lose this election badly, perhaps by as much as 10 points.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
N: The four men in dark suits.. The boss's name is RICHARDSON, early 40s. His top aide is.AHARRY, 50s.
C: RICHARDSON
D: This is a.bignight, gentleman.
N: (TOHARRY) Is ever ything set? Harry nods. Richardson notices his eyes:
C: RICHARDSON
D: You look tired. You should take a vacation when we finish with this. You'll have earned it.
C: HARRY
D: I'm not sure the kind of tired I feel would be fixed by a vacation.
N: 2/12/09 7.
C: RICHARDSON
D: Sure it would. Everybody needs a vacation. Even us.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE -- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT
N: The staff and supporters in here have become very quiet. Their candidate is standing in the middle of the room, but no one can look at him. And David can't look at them either... DAVID (TO CHARLIE) I'm going to take a walk, figure out my speech.
S: INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT
N: Four-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big screens in the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom. No one says a word. The mood has gone from.hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds.
S: INT. WALDORF LOBBY -- NIGHT
N: David slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the staff. But when he.gets to the door he sees that press vans line the front of the hotel. There will be no peace for him if he steps out there. He turns around.
C: ASSISTANT MANAGER
D: Good evening, Congressman. You're in the Grand Ballroom if that's what you're looking for.
C: DAVID
D: Actually just looking for a place to be alone for a minute before I head in there.
C: ASSISTANT MANAGER
D: None of the banquet rooms on the third floor are in use tonight.
C: DAVID
D: Thank you.
S: INT. EMPTY BANQUET ROOM -- NIGHT
N: David stands alone looking out at the empty room. Trying to get used to it. It's not easy. 2/12/09 8.
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT
N: David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row of sinks. He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his pocket. He twirls them in his hands for a moment. Then tosses them into the trash can. He looks at himself in the mirror, fighting to hold himself together. A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an expensive bottle of champagne.
C: WOMAN
D: Hi. I hope I didn't startle you.
C: DAVID
D: What are you doing in here?
C: WOMAN
D: Hiding from security.
C: DAVID
D: Oh... . What did you do?
C: WOMAN
D: Crashed a wedding. One floor up.
C: DAVID
D: It's almost midnight. They'just caught on now?
C: WOMAN
D: Ivana Trump finally realized I wasn't her niece. I think after the fifth; glass of champagne my Czech accent started slipping. spite of David's state that gets a grin.
C: DAVID
D: Are you for real?
C: WOMAN
D: Life is short.
C: DAVID
D: Hard to argue with that.
C: WOMAN
D: You're that guy running for Senate aren't you?
C: DAVID
D: I'm "that guy."
N: 2/12/09 9.
C: WOMAN
D: You winning?
C: DAVID
D: No.
C: WOMAN
D: Too bad. The other guy's a tool.
N: DAVID (LAUGHS) Maybe I should have made that clearer in my ads.
C: WOMAN
D: Personally, I think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal.
N: (BEAT) And I don't think the Post should have printed the photo. David just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that down and he knows it.
C: WOMAN
D: At least not full page. He can't help but crack up.
C: WOMAN
D: Listen, I've done it.
C: DAVID
D: You weren't running, for Senate at the time.
C: WOMAN
D: Do you still have a chance or is it over?
C: DAVID
D: He crushed me. She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for conveying empathy...
C: WOMAN
D: You must ...I don't know what you must be feeling...
C: DAVID
D: Winning would feel better. But losing has its advantages.
N: 2/12/09 10.
C: WOMAN
D: Like what?
C: DAVID
D: The only time a politician is alone is when he's asleep.. .or in the bathroom. After eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take. She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.
C: WOMAN
D: Watching you, you'd never know it. The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even quite sure what it is. Not yet.
C: DAVID
D: Thank you...
C: WOMAN
D: Well, everything happens for a reason, right? Even losing. God, I'm really rollrng out the platitudes tonight, aren't I?
C: DAVID
D: It's the champagne. Brines out the Hallmark in people.
C: WOMAN
D: After it kills their Czech accents. She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it.
C: DAVID
D: Why not? I have to think up some good platitudes for my speech. He takes a gulp of champagne.
C: WOMAN
D: Why the hell would you do that?
C: DAVID
D: Apparently, even if I hadn't been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign I would have lost the election anyway because I'm too blunt.
C: WOMAN
D: Says who?
E: swig of champagne
N: 2/12/09 11.
C: DAVID
D: The TV pundits.
C: WOMAN
D: Fuck 'em. They just wish they had the balls to be candidates themselves. She hands him the champagne bottle again.
C: WOMAN
D: And they work for the Man anyway.
N: (BEAT) You going to run again? DAVID (DRINKS) Tonight's probably not the night to ask. WOMAN (FINGER POINTING) No, it is. Look at me. You have to run again. Do-yo hear me? She's serious about this. Intense.
C: WOMAN
D: Otherwise the-country will be run by tools. like Lynwood.
C: DAVID
D: "Field." "Lynfield." A beat. She shrugs. Then they lean toward each other... and kiss. It turns more and more passionate. When they finally pull apart:
E: of f her look
C: DAVID
D: Holy shit. She seems just as surprised. They look at each other and laugh. Just then the bathroom door opens. It's Charlie. He sees David and the woman.

C: WOMAN
D: Gotta go. Don't let the bastards grind you down. She spins and sprints away. The hotel guards chase her.
E: to David, emphatically.
C: CHARLIE

C: DAVID
D: But I think I'm ready to give my speech.

C: DAVID
D: I grew up in Red Hook and I don't want to shock anybody but I got in a few fist fights along the way. Laughter ripples through the crowd. We don't know enough yet to get the joke.
N: 2/12/09 13.
C: DAVID
D: And we used to have a saying when you got in a fight: "it's not whether or not you get knocked down -- because eventually everyone does -- it's what you do when you get back up."
N: (BEAT) Don't worry, I'm not going to moon you. The audience explodes with laughter this time.
C: DAVID
D: But I am... But I am going to get backup. I wanted to come out here tonight and give you a victory speech, a speech I've dreamed of giving foremost of my life. But life doesn't always deal you the cards you want. The audience sobered now. Reflective.
E: waiting for the laughter to die down
C: DAVID
D: My life changed when I was ten years old. My entire world turned upside-down.' His audience,. knows exactly what he's talking about.
C: DAVID
D: And as I looked for something to -hang ;on to, something; to help me cope' with what had. happened the only thing that made sense to me was service. Finding a way to do something with my life that left this world a little better than I found it. The audience is moved. Tears begin to well up. People dab at their eyes.

S: EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING
C: HARRY
D: Dammit! Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus-- HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him. TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood--
S: INT. RSR CAPITAL -- CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING
N: A big corner office. The phone rings. Charlie picks up.
C: DAVID
D: Guess who I just sat down next to on the bus?
E: TEL. V.O.
T: INTERCUTTING WITH CHARLIE
C: CHARLIE
D: Who?
C: DAVID
D: The woman from election night.
S: EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING
N: A dazed Harry lies in the road... The taxi driver who hit him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay... 2/12/09 24.
S: INT. BUS -- MORNING

E: TEL. V.O.
C: DAVID
D: She kissed me. I just didn't fight it.
S: EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING
N: Harry sits up... He's bruised but okay. He looks around for something. Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front tire.
S: INT. BUS -- MORNING
C: CHARLIE
D: You're shitting me. Just randomly you sit down next to-- He's cut off mid-word.
E: O.S.
C: DAVID
D: Charlie? David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David hits redial. Gets a fast busy.
C: DAVID
D: ' . This is ridiculous. He pockets his phone.
E: to himself
S: EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH MORNING
N: The taxi driver is with Harry now.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Are you okay? Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently for something.
C: HARRY
D: I'm fine-- Will you hand me that? Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."
N: 2/12/09 25.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Are you sure you're okay? The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram: Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese. And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: Oh...shit...
S: EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING
N: David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office tower. He enters through the revolving door--
S: INT. DAVID'S OFFICE BUILDING'-- GROUND FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING
N: Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other end of the lobby. David gets into an empty elevator.
S: INT. 41ST FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING
N: David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone. He waves as-he:passes by. No wade back. She must not see him.
C: DAVID
D: Okay... Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.
S: INT. RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- MORNING
N: David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul in sight. Not a single secretary is here.
C: DAVID
D: Doesn't anybody bother getting in before eight at this place? David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling.
E: loud, playful
N: 2/12/09 26. DAVID (CONT'D) (EXUBERANT) Susan! How are you today? (when she doesn't move) Susan? David looks closer across her desk. Her face is frozen.
C: DAVID
D: Susan? He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead still. David rushes through Charlie's door:
E: CONT'D
C: DAVID
D: Call 911! Something's wrong with Susan!
S: INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING
N: --and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with the phone up to his ear. Like he's in a wax museum. He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear). One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached to the left side.of Charlie's skull.
C: DAVID
D: Jesus! Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night.
C: DAVID
D: What the hell are you doing?! Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:
E: ,.CONT'D
C: RICHARDSON
D: Grab him! David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--
S: INT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING
N: David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he gets there. He grabs it. It's locked. He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges from a door in the middle of the hallway. 2/12/09 27. David jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that Richardson could have gotten there that fast.
C: RICHARDSON
D: You can't get away, David. David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard. As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is frozen solid. David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall. Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast-- David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT... FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of the large corner offices on the 40th floor. The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid." Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,
N: INSIDE -- Except when they walk through the door they're not in an office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a large warehouse... Their movement completely violates the laws of physics.
C: BLACK SCREEN
D: Silence. Then voices come up slowly:
C: RICHARDSON
D: Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I understand that, sir. Absolutely. I'll do that, sir.
E: O.S.
N: (BEAT) What a goddamm mess.
C: MCCRADY
D: Was that Donaldson?
E: O.S.
C: RICHARDSON
D: Yes.
E: O.S.
C: MCCRADY
D: What do you want to do?
E: O.S.
N: 2/12/09 28. FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out. A half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver Suits) stand nearby. Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away.
C: RICHARDSON
D: Can you reset him?
E: O.S.
C: MCCRADY
D: I don't think we have the authority in a situation like this.
E: O.S.
N: RICHARDSON (O.S.) CALL LEGAL-
C: BURDENSKY .
D: Legal just arrived.
E: 0.S.
S: INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY
N: REVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit, carrying a briefcase. He.walks to Richardson.
C: BURDENSKY
D: Re-setting's off the table. This is our fault:... Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself off to the side, clearly disgraced. David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson, cranes around to see who's talking.
C: DAVID
D: Hey. The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume.
C: RICHARDSON
D: What are my options?
N: BURDENSKY (IGNORING DAVID) You could bullshit him but you'll never be completely successful.
C: DAVID
D: Can somebody tell me what's going on?
N: 2/12/09 29.
C: BURDENSKY
D: The questions will burn in him till the day he dies. You'll have to monitor him constantly...
E: still ignoring him
C: ON DAVID
D: He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying--
C: BURDENSKY
D: .to make sure he doesn't talk... the endless ripple effects... REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him.
E: PARTIALLY AUDIBLE
N: ON THE SUITS
C: BURDENSKY
D: If it were me, I'd level with him.
C: RIC:HARDSON
D: Completely?
C: BURDENSKY
D: That's the only way to extinguish his curiosity. Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him. An uncomfortable pause.
C: DAVID
D: Who are you guys?
C: RICHARDSON
D: We're the people v ho make sure things happen according to Plan. David stares back at him for a moment. then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse. Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--
C: CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR
D: It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as David's foot comes down on it.
N: 2/12/09 30.
C: BACK TO WIDE SHOT
D: David trips and goes flying--
C: MOMENTS LATER
D: David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed back in his chair in front of Richardson.
C: RICHARDSON
D: Did you really think I couldn't see that coming? David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.
C: RICHARDSON
D: I can read your mind! David stares back.
E: CONT'D
C: RICHARDSON
D: Yeah, really...
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Choose a color. (barely a beat) Blue. Choose a number. (even less time) Seventeen. David's jaw drops slightly. Richardson was clearly right.
C: RICHARDSON
D: Now,. why are you still deciding whether or not to run? David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from spilling out into view.
C: RICHARDSON
D: You saw the futility of that back at the office. David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking point. He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all this based in the world he's known to date...
C: DAVID
D: What the hell is happening to me?
N: 2/12/09 31.
C: RICHARDSON
D: You just saw behind a curtain you weren't even supposed to know was there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring. I'm sure.
C: DAVID
D: I just... came to work...
C: RICHARDSON
D: It wasn't your fault. Your Path through the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted. Your coffee was supposed to.spill onto your shirt as you left Starbucks near your apartment. You would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten minutes later than you did. By then we would have left.
E: glancing bitterly at Harry, in the corner
N: (BEAT) People call it "chance" when their coffee spills or their internet goes down or they misplace their keys. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it's:us...nudging you back on Plan. David takes all this in. He's still shell-shocked.
C: DAVID
D: Whatever you were doing to Charlie back there... it wasn't misplacing his keys.
C: RICHARDSON
D: Sometimes. when nudging a person back on Plan isn't enough we intervene directly.
C: DAVID
D: Why Charlie? What did you do to him.
C: RICHARDSON
D: You need to worry about getting back on your Plan, David, not worry about us putting him back on his. David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.
C: RICHARDSON
D: Only a handful of human beings know what you now know, David. We're determined to keep it that way.
E: CONT'D
N: 2/12/09 32.
C: RICHARDSON
D: So before I let you go, you need to understand something: If you ever reveal our existence we will erase your brain. Your memories, your emotions, your entire personality will be expunged. Your friends and family will think you've gone crazy. You won't "think" anything because a blank slate can't "think." Davidstares back.
E: CONT'D
C: RICHARDSON
D: Do you understand what I just said?
C: DAVID
D: Yes...
C: RICHARDSON
D: Not a word. Not one word about us. (long beat as he studies
C: DAVID'S FACE)
D: okay ... . you're free to go. David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real. Richardson points at the door. David walks toward it. Just then another man comes up to Richardson.
C: NEW MAN IN SUIT
D: There's awoman.
N: RICHARDSON (SIGHS) There's always & Woman... Richardson motions;to his men. At.-THE DOOR Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.
C: DAVID
D: He said I could go.
N: CENTER OF ROOM
C: NEW MAN IN SUIT
D: You won't believe who she is. He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.
N: 2/12/09 33.
C: RICHARDSON
D: How is that possible? Why didn't we get an alert?
C: NEW MAN IN SUIT
D: He wasn't supposed to be on that bus. He was supposed to be changing his shirt in his apartment... It was a controlled situation. It was supposed to be. The new man looks at Harry.
C: AT THE DOOR
D: David looks back at Richardson.
C: DAVID
D: You said I could go. Richardson walks over to him.
C: RIC,HARDSON
D: You ran into a woman named Elise on the bus this morning?
C: DAVID
D: Why does it'matter?
E: :going very still
C: RICHARDSON
D: You weren't ever supposed to see her again.
C: DAVID
D: Why do you care.?
C: RICHARDSON
D: Because, David, you can't be with her. And we didn't want to have to resort to this-- Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--
C: DAVID
D: What the hell-- What are you-- Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her number on from David's wallet--
N: DAVID (CONT'D) NO-- 2/12/09 34. Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then pulls out a lighter--
C: DAVID
D: No! And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team men. But he can't get free.
E: CONT'D
C: DAVID
D: What is wrong with you people?! Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn. ON David's reaction CUT TO:
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY
N: David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him. He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts walking to the corner to orient himself. Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.
S: INT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON
N: David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly.
C: BARTENDER
D: You're David Norris, right?
C: DAVID
D: Ice water.
C: BARTENDER
D: That's it? David nods. Harry arrives.
C: HARRY
D: We should talk. But not here. Go back to work and I'll contact you later today with a place to meet.
N: 2/12/09 35.
C: DAVID
D: Okay. Harry can see that David is still very shaken.
C: HARRY
D: The world's exactly the same as it's always been. You just understand it more completely now.
N: (BEAT) Hang on to what mattered before you knew any of this and you'll be fine.
S: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- DAY
N: A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.
S: INT. RSR OFFICES -- DAY
N: David enters. Stares at,,hisnew colleagues going about their business as if nothing happened.
S: INT. 40TH FLOOR --:DAY
N: David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve Kincaid." He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely disorienting for him.
C: SECRETARY
D: Mr. IKincaid's in the finance meeting, Congressitan. Main conference room. David turns to see her.
E: O.S.
C: DAVID
D: Thanks. David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner.
C: CHARLIE
D: There you are. I called your cell ten times. You left me hanging.
C: DAVID
D: Sorry...
N: 2/12/09 36.
C: CHARLIE
D: (seeing the look in
C: DAVID'S EYES)
D: Are you okay? Come on, we're late. Happy first day by the way. They head towards the conference room.
E: off David's nod
C: CHARLIE
D: You sure you're okay.
C: DAVID
D: Fine. How about you?
C: CHARLIE
D: Great. Why?
C: DAVID
D: No headaches or--
C: CHARLIE
D: I feel fantastic, -man. Is it just, me or is this an odd conversation? What the hell happened with the girl?
E: off David" s non-response.
C: DAVID
D: After the meeting.
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM RSR CAPITAL DAY
N: LONG SHOT from outside the building. The firm's partners sit at their weekly investment committee meeting. David watches Charlie intently, looking for what's changed...
S: INT RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- DAY
N: David and Charlie walk back to David's office.
C: CHARLIE
D: Please explain to me why you don't have an ear-to-ear smile right now.
E: CONT'D
N: THEY ENTER--
S: INT. DAVID'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: David hesitates. It's like his friend is an alien.. .but then again he's totally normal. 2/12/09 37.
C: DAVID
D: I lost her number.
C: CHARLIE
D: You lost her number?
C: DAVID
D: I was pickpocketed.
E: searching for something
C: CHARLIE
D: Come on. You can't be serious. You're serious... Oh, man...dude. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...
E: off David's look
S: EXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY
N: David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise. EXT. CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.
C: HARRY
D: A lot of people just collapse when they see what you've s'een. Their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them. Life starts to feel pointless.
C: DAVID
D: I was` raised to believe there's something behind the curtain. I just never pictured it quite like this.
C: HARRY
D: Most people don't. Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his colleagues. He's far from relaxed.
C: HARRY
D: How are you feeling?
C: DAVID
D: You should know. You can read my mind, right?
N: 2/12/09 38. Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David, how far to go with this. Finally:
C: HARRY
D: Richardson was just trying to scare you.
C: DAVID
D: He knew what color I was thinking.
C: HARRY
D: Because he set it up as a choice. "Choose a color. Choose a number"
C: DAVID
D: So? Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting himself out there:
C: HARRY
D: We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts. But before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we percpite that. We know if you're going to go off Plan "or not because, as long as we're close enough, we cansense it when it's about to happen.
C: DAVID
D: it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?
C: HARRY
D: Seventh, actually.
C: DAVID
D: What did they do too Charlie?
C: HARRY
D: Made some small change in the way he assesses risk.
C: DAVID
D: What type of risk?
C: HARRY
D: I don't know. Something arcane. Something to do with mortgage- backed securities.
E: this is beside the point
C: DAVID
D: That's all?
N: 2/12/09 39
C: HARRY
D: Yes.
C: DAVID
D: What would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me? This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.
C: HARRY
D: That's why we're meeting out here.
C: DAVID
D: They're not following me?
C: HARRY
D: We don't have the manpower to follow everybody all the time. They're checking in on you. Just not here. Not right now. ON David's face considering this.
S: EXT. UPPER DECK DAY
N: Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few tourists up here.
C: DAVID
D: Why are you helping me?
C: HARRY
D: I have my reasons. David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into
N: THEM:
C: DAVID
D: Why do they care if I'm with Elise?
C: HARRY
D: Your entire reality gets shattered this morning and you want to know about a woman?
C: DAVID
D: Why do they care? Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David seems to care.
C: HARRY
D: I don't know.
N: 2/12/09 40.
C: DAVID
D: You have no idea?
C: HARRY
D: All I know is, given the amount of resources they've used, keeping you from her is pretty important to them. You're going to look for her aren't you? Again, David is silent.
E: off David's silence
C: HARRY
D: There are twelve million people in this city. On a slow day. You're not going to find her, you do realize that, don't yore-?
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Even if a hypnotist pulled her number out of the recesses of your brain, no matter how many times you called it, you,'d never get through...
C: DAVID
D: They send you here to tell me that?
E: his face hardening
C: HARRY
D: You want my advice? Forget about her. Accept that you'`>ll never see her again. Move on with your life. ON David as Harry's words sink in.
E: CONT'D
T: FADE TO:
S: EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING
N: Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.
S: INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING
N: An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's already awake, staring at the ceiling... After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it off. But then just lies there... 2/12/09 41.
S: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
N: It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed. No files on the table, like there were the last time we were here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.
C: CHARLIE
D: How are you feeling about the speech? David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:
E: PHONE V.O.
C: DAVID
D: I'm ready... I changed a few things last night.
C: CHARLIE
D: Tell me at breakfast.
E: PHONE V.O.
N: THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.
S: EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING
N: David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.
S: INT. BUS -- MORNING
N: David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.
S: INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING
N: David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus. DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk. 2/12/09 42. David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.
C: DAVID
D: Stop the bus.
C: DRIVER
D: The next stop--
C: DAVID
D: Now.
S: EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING
N: The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He catches up to her at University Place.
C: DAVID
D: Elise! The woman turns around. And it's her...
C: ELISE
D: David?
C: DAVID
D: Hi.
C: ELISE
D: Wow... How areyou. Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:
C: DAVID
D: I rode the Ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day I'd run into you again. She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.
E: from the heart
C: ELISE
D: Calling would have been easier.
C: DAVID
D: I couldn't.
C: ELISE
D: Girlfriend wouldn't let you?
N: 2/12/09 43.
C: DAVID
D: No girlfriend. She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his expression is dead serious.
C: DAVID
D: Can we go somewhere and talk? She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at herself for that, but it's the truth.
E: CONT'D
C: ELISE
D: Don't you have to get to work?
E: re: his suit
C: DAVID
D: I just got sick.
C: ELISE
D: "I haven't seen you in three years - - You make me sick" is not an ideal come-on. For the record. David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.
C: DAVID
D: One second.
N: (PICKING UP) CharlieT can't make breakfast.
C: CHARLIE
D: Why not?
E: PHONE V.O.
C: DAVID
D: And...I might have to push the speech.
C: CHARLIE
D: What? Are you crazy?!
E: PHONE V.O.
C: DAVID
D: I just ran into Elise. He hangs up.
C: ELISE
D: You just hung up on your best friend.
C: DAVID
D: We've known each other since we were kids. We have a shorthand.
N: 2/12/09 44. He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter- of-fact. Serious.
C: ELISE
D: What speech?
C: DAVID
D: Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk. His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting reeled in again.
C: ELISE
D: Where?
C: DAVID
D: Somewhere far. We have a lot to talk about.
C: ELISE
D: I don't think you should cancel your speech. What if I don't like you at the end of our walk?
C: DAVID
D: I'll take my chances.
C: ELISE
D: Seri6us1y, my number hasn't changed:. Just call me like you didn't last time.
C: DAVID
D: My-speech will always be there, you might not be.
N: ELISE (AMUSED/INDIGNANT) I was there, David. You didn't callrie!
C: DAVID
D: Walk with me and I'll explain that. She's still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns it off .
C: DAVID
D: I'm not losing you again. I'm not letting you out of my sight.
E: CONT'D a statement of fact
C: ELISE
D: Stalker.
N: 2/12/09 45.
C: DAVID
D: Can we walk? The moment she finally relents, CUT TO:
C: FOLLOWING SHOT
D: Polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders.
S: INT. ELEGANT OFFICE -- DAY
N: Mr. Richardson sits at a large desk. The design is Art Deco crossed with Albert Speer. Downtown Manhattan is visible out the 30th floor window. Richardson's aide enters.

S: EXT. GRAMERCY -- DAY
N: David and Elise walk north.
C: ELISE
D: It's been years, David. How do you know I don't have a boyfriend? Oh, shit. He hasn't even had time to think about that.
C: DAVID
D: you have a boyfriend?
C: EL ;E
D: Would it-Matter?
N: DAVID (TRAPPED) Uh...yeah...
C: ELISE
D: So all the stuff about me being in your mind constantly for the last three years was just talk... The truth is you don't have any real conviction.
C: DAVID
D: It wouldn't matter.
C: ELISE
D: So you don't care about being a home-wrecker?
N: 2/12/09 46.
C: DAVID
D: Okay... if you were married it would matter.
C: ELISE

N: DAVID AND ELISE
C: DAVID

C: DONALDSON
D: I'm going-'to interpret those rules loosely. I'm going to go easy on you because,I feel the deck was stacked ,against you. In a WIDER shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson's AIDE sit nearby.
C: DONALDSON
D: I'm talking about the intense chemistry between them, the constant inflection points, and the kicker of course: you pulling them apart only to have "chance" put them back together. Twice. That seemed impossible. So I asked Burdensky to do some research this morning, which he just completed.

So we gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revoluton.:ï¿½we spent six hundred years tempering your passions with reason.,then in 1910 we stepped ba ï¿½c again. Within fifty yearsï¿½you brought us World War I, the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the Holocaust ani capped it off by bringingtheentire planet to the brink of destruction in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

C: THOMPSON
D: You'd still be living in caves if it weren't for us.
N: DAVID (WELLING EMOTION) You crush our dreams because they don't fit with your Plan. Your Plan that has no space for me falling in love but somehow has room for Tsunamis and cyclones and Darfur and AIDS. Fuck your plan. I reject it. I reject you. (MORE) 2/12/09 96.

N: (BEAT) Kill me. Or erase me. Or let me go. Thompson stares back at him, dumbfounded. A long silence, THEN:

D: She's a beautiful dancer.
C: DAVID
D: What do you want?
C: THOMPSON
D: There's one more piece to all this I haven't told you. I guess I didn't have the heart. If you stay with her, it doesn't just kill your dreams, it kills hers.
C: DAVID
D: What?
N: 2/12/09 97.
C: THOMPSON
D: Elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country... and eventually one of the greatest choreographers in the world.
N: (BEAT) If she stays with you... she ends up teaching dance to eight year-olds.
C: DAVID
D: I don't believe you. I thought we already established that. A beat.
C: THOMPSON
D: When you look back at all this, David, just remember, we tried to reason with you. Thompson gets up and leaves...just as the lights go down for the next dance. David watches him go...then turns around just in time to catch Elise's entrance into the dance -- a graceful jump. When she lands, her ankle cracks, and she falls. The audience gasps. INSERT: a floor board tilted oddly. It goes back to normal. FIND THOMPSON: His hand slightly outstretched. THE AUDIENCE instantly knows something is wrong.

He looks at them, unable to summon his usual wit.
C: THOMPSON
D: This is what you do, David.
N: (GETTING UP) This is what you did the first night you got elected. This is what you did at that college reunion. We give you opportunities people would kill for and you squander them with impulse. It doesn't take a genius to see Elise isn't exactly going to help you with that. (MORE) 2/12/09 99.

So etthing about his{,speaking style has changed. He's not as ima ea or passion te.:Hedoesn't seem to enjoy it as much is he Â°did three years ago. Just then a campaign aide arrives at Charlie's table.
C: CHARLIE
D: How's he doing?
C: CAMPAIGN AIDE
D: They still love him... Papers? The aide hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers, the Times, the Journal, and the three big NYC tabloids.
C: CHARLIE
D: Thanks.
N: 2/12/09 102. The aide leaves. Charlie glances at the front page of the Times, then reaches for the New York / Region section. As he does the front page of the Arts section catches his eye. There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split," accompanying an article titled "Dance Takes a Quantum Leap." Charlie glances through the window at David who is climbing down from the pickup truck to applause from his parking lot audience.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT -- MORNING
N: David shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his speech. They really do love him.
S: INT. DINER, UPSTATE NEW YORK MORNING
N: Charlie reads the New York Times. article. It begins: "Once in a generation a piece is created of such astounding originality and virtuosity that it single-handedly reshapes. the. world of dance."

D: I'm going to show you this because you'd find out eventually and because I want to be here when you do. Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it.

N: SENTENCE: 2/12/09 103. "The show's choreographer, Adrian Troussant, and lead dancer, Elise Sellas, are partners on and off stage and plan to marry in New York next week." David stares at the words...
C: CHARLIE
D: David? David?
E: off no response
C: DAVID
D: I think I need... I...
C: CHARLIE
D: Take a day off. Take a couple. We're sixteen points up.
N: DAVID (HOLLOWED OUT) Even I can't blow a lead that big.
S: EXT. RED HOOK, BROOKLYN NIGHT
N: It's pouring rain. David walks down Carroll Street. Most of the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs. Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is clearly in the early'stages of gentrification. David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes by. Was this his house?
S: EXT. / INT. NEIGHBORHOOD DAR -- NIGHT
N: There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in the window. David enters this classic dive bar and goes to the bartender.
C: DAVID
D: Do you still serve neighborhood guys here or just the tourists? The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar notice him. Then others notice and they start whooping it up for him. He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him.
S: EXT. RED HOOK DOCKS -- NIGHT
N: David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers, holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag. 2/12/09 104. There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls. A figure in a suit approaches David from behind. He turns to see the man.
C: DAVID
D: Why are you here? REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.
C: HARRY
D: I would have come earlier but I had to wait for the rain. Water interferes with their ability to sense your decision tree. That's why we met on a boat last time.
E: off David's confusion
N: (BEAT) I guess I'm here to set the record straight.
C: DAVID
D: About what?
C: HARRY-
D: Thompson was lying when he said they couldn't let you be with 8lise because :it would bring out your reckless side.
C: DAVID
D: Why, then? Why do they care so much?
C: HARRY
D: 8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplause'and dreams of one day becoming p sident... if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.
C: HARRY
D: I've watched you a long time. They're right to want you in the White House. It would be good for the world. That's important but it can't be the only thing that matters.
C: DAVID
D: Why are you so different than they are?
N: 2/12/09 105. A long beat, then:
C: HARRY
D: You know, your Dad was a smart man. He could have been a lot more -- and he wanted to be. So did your brother. But the Plan didn't call for that. This hits David hard.
C: HARRY
D: In my job, you implement the Plan...
N: (EMOTIONAL) And most of the time.. .you don't even know why... (BEAT) I'm sorry...
C: DAVID
D: My mom?
C: HARRY
D: That wasn't me... that wasn't us at all. David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink. Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes a drink as well.
C: DAVID
D: When Thompson told methe choice as Elise or the White House I barely hesitated.
C: D1 ID
D: But the trt t i `is after making that choice I went into a free-fall... Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to see Thompson hurt her...but I used it as an excuse. I think I left her more to save my career than hers.
N: (STRUGGLING) Thompson wasn't lying. The press is already talking about me as a future president. I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm still sixteen points up in the polls.
C: HARRY
D: The public loves you.
N: 2/12/09 106.
C: DAVID
D: Before I met Elise that was all that mattered. Now I hardly notice. She's all I think about.
N: (BEAT) Do you know where she's getting married?
C: HARRY
D: Front of a judge. Tomorrow morning.
C: DAVID
D: Is she happy with him? Tell me she is and I'll walk away.
C: HARRY
D: Thompson won't let you get near that courthouse.
C: DAVID
D: Harry... is she happy?
C: HARRY
D: No. A beat.
C: DW-ID
D: I have to get her back.. Harry knows how unlikely that is.
C: DAVID
D: Will you help me:ï¿½ Just help me get to her...
C: HARDY
D: They'll sense )tOu coming a mile away.'
C: DAVID
D: What if Icould move as fast as you can?
C: HARRY
D: What do you mean?
C: DAVID
D: Teach me about the doors.
C: HARRY
D: How do you know about that?
N: 2/12/09 107.
C: DAVID
D: The first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one.I thought it was a hallucination at first. Eventually I realized it's how you move around so fast. If you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you...okay, that's your choice. But if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine?
E: off Harry's reluctance
C: HARRY
D: Do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors... how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey?
C: DAVID
D: You know, when I do town hall meetings I usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when I walk, through' the door and when I start speaking. But when I'm done with the speech I can call on each one of them by `game. A beat...
C: HARRY
D: I've seen you do that The rain is supposed to stop in the nexthou'r. We're going to need all night to do this. And we're going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it.

C: HARRY
D: Lower Manhattan is a nightmare. Layer upon layer of substrate -- that's what we call the system of doors -- has been added over time. That makes it a lot more complex to navigate down here than it is uptown. And a lot slower. Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and exterior, all below Canal Street.

N: ONE -- locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise tries shakes her head.
C: DAVID
D: They're not supposed to be locked! David hears sounds coming from the building's central staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits climbing up the stairs.
N: 2/12/09 127. DING. The elevator door down the hall opens. More men in silver suits.
C: ELISE
D: This one's open! Elise is standing at the door to the roof. David runs to her and they go up the stairs together to--
S: EXT. ROOF -- DAY
N: David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on them. They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ; David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They hang their legs over the edge and jump. They sprint across the roof of the building next door -- except somehow they find themselves running across the same roof they were just on. David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open from inside. David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the building's edge they climb over again and... run... Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting. They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent roofs. They're completely surrounded.
C: ELISE
D: Kiss me. Tears well in her eyes. And his.

D: I love you, David Norris.
N: 2/12/09 128. They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally, open their eyes.. .ready to accept their fate-- They see an empty roof. The Silver Suits are gone. And the rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them... They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing there, alone.
C: THE CHAIRMAN
D: Hello, David... Good morning, Elise. His voice is gentle, paternal.
C: DAVID
D: Who are you?
C: THE CHAIRMAN
D: I think you know. David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.
C: DAVID
D: You can't oti{rn Fate... Tft , CHAIRMAN It's .more- complicated t,}an that, Fate am Free Will coexist They're;in tension with each other. And pure chance. A beat. David looks back at him...
N: DAVID TH2;.>ï¿½HAT, RMAN I could control 'everything. You'd be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets. I try to .keep things from getting too out of control. But that has a cost. Most people go through life like pinballs, reacting predictably to the stimuli I apply. They accept the path they find themselves on. And perform accordingly. But every once in a while someone comes along who refuses to be bound by his fate, someone who understands that Free Will is a gift most people are too afraid to use. (BEAT) Which, you see, is partly the point of all this. 2/12/09 129. THE CHAIRMAN (cont'd) Or maybe you don't see it. Maybe you just feel it. And that's even better. Because that's the other part. David and Elise take it in...
C: DAVID
D: And all the misery, all the pain...
C: THE CHAIRMAN
D: I sit up there and I watch it and it hurts me... . but if you could see the incredible courage people show, the random acts of kindness, the love... If you could see huitan beings choosing every moment every day to be better thAn'' I made them, you would know it's all worthwhile.
N: (BEAT) Good luck, David. And good luck to you, Elise. You're a-beautiful dancer. And so much more... The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.
C: THE CHAIRMAN
D: Their case isclosed.
C: AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN
D: But, Sir,isn't this a majtr. deviation from The Plan? The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.
C: THE CHAIRMAN
D: Not anymc3e . David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by what=they've just experienced. As He disappears around a corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ... After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say "what do we do now?"
C: DAVID
D: Maybe we should go dancing. A smile slowly spreads across her face ...
N: THE END
