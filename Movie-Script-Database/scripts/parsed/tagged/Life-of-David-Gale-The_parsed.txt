S: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE
N: A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist. She runs, and runs. She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway. Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort. She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

S: INT. OFFICE OF "DEATHWATCH AUSTIN" - SUNRISE
N: A clock on the wall: 6:11. Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin."
C: YOUNG MAN
D: It's probably been about seven minutes...
E: O.S.
N: The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear. The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at nothing. She bites her lip.
C: COLLEGE GUY
D: Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement. 6:12. Roughly eight minutes. Number 36 this year for the Great State of Texas.
E: a beat as he records the time
N: They all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands.
C: CONSTANCE
D: David, don't start throwing things.
N: A PHONE RINGS. David controls himself.
C: DAVID
D: I'm going home. Let's do the press fax tomorrow.
N: Another PHONE RINGS. Constance stands.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Go. I'll do it.
N: He nods to her, exits. She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male. The wall clock reads 6:13.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE
N: The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty parking lot to Volvo station wagon. As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the capitol building in the distance.
S: INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE
N: David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down.
S: EXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE
N: David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.
S: INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE
N: He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the reflection of the rising sun. BACK TO DAVID He stares, then:
C: DAVID
D: Hey!
N: The cop ignores him.
C: DAVID
D: Yo! Officer!
N: The cop looks over; his face says he expects a confrontation. David points to the seat belt buckle.
C: DAVID
D: Your seatbelt.
N: The cop nods, weary, embarrassed. He reaches back for the belt. David takes a sip and drives on.

N: PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN:
S: INT. NEWS MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY
N: KRUGER (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating low-fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric massager. A name plate on her desk reads "Barbara D. Kruger, Crime and Courts Editor." News magazine covers are on the walls. Kruger is black, short, overweight, wears an old jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes. She has half- frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck.
C: ROBERTS
D: Gale had sought a review of his 1993 conviction for the rape and murder of University of Texas colleague, Constance Harraway.
E: V.O.
N: Kruger reaches for a phone, hits four numbers, takes a chip. ON TV A book-jacket photo of Constance. BACK ON ROBERTS
C: ROBERTS
D: Defense lawyers had hoped to argue that Gale's former activism against capital punishment unduly prejudiced...
E: V.O.
N: ON KRUGER She waits impatiently, munching, swallowing.
C: ROBERTS
D: ...the Texas judicial system. Citing 'discriminating purpose' --
E: V.O.
C: KRUGER
D: Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale. It's on Court TV right now, listen.
E: into the phone
N: She holds the phone out in the direction of the TV, uses the opportunity to eat another chip. ON TV We see old footage of David on a TV talk show.
C: ROBERTS
D: ...clear political gain in executing its leading opponent of the death penalty...
E: V.O.
N: ON KRUGER
C: KRUGER
D: So, what's it gonna be? Belyeu said to call after the decision... No, they said only Bitsey.
E: into the phone, swallowing
C: ROBERTS
D: ...Further failed to consider that the victim was herself an abolitionist activist...
E: V.O. in b.g.
C: KRUGER
D: It means only Bitsey. Bill, I don't get to make the rules, I'm a fat black woman.
N: Bitsey Bloom (The runner from the opening) enters. She wears, as always, a tailored suit.
C: KRUGER
D: ...What we need is to put her on a plane to Houston.
E: into the phone
C: BITSEY
D: Gale's going down.
E: WOMAN
N: Kruger shushes her with a we-know-already gesture.
C: KRUGER
D: Why do you always get lordosis around legal? She's here.
E: into the phone
N: She puts him on SPEAKER, and reaches for a chip.
C: BITSEY
D: Hi. What's lordosis?
E: to the phone
C: BILL
D: Female ape's posture when preparing for intercourse. Hello, Bitsey.
E: V.O.
N: Bitsey shoots Kruger a look, mouths "you're sick."
C: BILL
D: Look, kids, setting aside the cost issue, though half-a-million dollars for three two hour interviews is not only illegal it's obscen--
E: V.O.
C: KRUGER
D: Market value. Guy's never talked.
C: BILL
D: That aside, I, we are still uncomfortable with the arrangement.
E: V.O.
C: BITSEY
D: Meaning?
C: BILL
D: Meaning you've just spent a very public seven days in jail for a very public contempt of court citation.
E: V.O.
C: BITSEY
D: Protecting sources, even kiddie porn scumbags, is magazine policy.
C: BILL
D: And I, we continue to appreciate your decision. We're just concerned. A rapist slash murderer, five days before he's executed, demands a reporter known for protecting sexual deviants. A reporter who is also a very attractive woman --
E: V.O.
N: Bitsey and Kruger moan in unison.
C: KRUGER
D: This is disparate treatment.
C: BITSEY
D: I could go if I were an ugly blabby guy?
C: BILL
D: There's an agenda issue here which would be diffused with an older male...
E: V.O.
C: KRUGER
D: I hear lawyers gleefully saying the words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc.
C: BITSEY
D: 'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex.'
C: KRUGER
D: You've gotta let her go now.
C: BILL
D: That's not quite what I meant.
E: V.O.
C: KRUGER
D: He's gotta let you go.
C: BITSEY
D: 'Certain references were made -- '
C: BILL
D: All right. All right. Enough. The intern is with you at all times?
E: V.O. interrupting
N: Bitsey vehemently shakes her head "no" to this idea.
C: KRUGER
D: Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye.
N: Kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond.
C: BITSEY
D: I'm not baby-sitting.
N: Kruger reaches for a chip.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
N: ZACK (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and looking at a case file in his lap. He holds the cigarette just outside the slightly open window. Zack has a bohemian grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses. As Bitsey drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel. We hear strained patience in her voice.
C: BITSEY
D: Gale was seen leaving the house.
S: EXT. INTERSTATE 45 - NIGHT
N: The car's lights move past a sign: "Huntsville 27 Miles."
C: BITSEY
D: His sperm was inside her.
E: V.O.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
C: BITSEY
D: His prints were all over the kitchen, including one on the bag.
N: Zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor, hands handcuffed behind her. Over her head is an opaque white plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape.
C: ZACK
D: Half-a-thumb print.
C: BITSEY
D: Okay, half-a-thumb print.
C: ZACK
D: Could have touched it before it was a murder weapon.
C: BITSEY
D: Do you fondle your friends' garbage bags?
C: ZACK
D: Yeah, I get very touchy around household plastics. 'Hello, everybody -- ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just saying the bag could have been out on the counter or something.
N: She looks at him a beat.
C: BITSEY
D: Hey, Zack?
C: ZACK
D: Yeah.
C: BITSEY
D: He did it.
C: ZACK
D: But the murder's way too fucking clumsy. And this guy's a major intellectual. Top of his Yale class, a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two books. He's an academic stud.
C: BITSEY
D: And, empirically speaking, a psychotic.
N: Zack picks up another file photo: Christmas shot of the Gale family: David (31), his wife (Sharon, beautiful, 29), and son (Chase, 6).
C: ZACK
D: Look at his wife, she's a regular Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father was Ambassador to Spain --
C: BITSEY
D: Shit! The light's on again.
E: looking at the car's instrument panel
N: CLOSEUP - OVERHEAT LIGHT is on. BACK TO SCENE
C: ZACK
D: Ignore it. It's a rental.
C: BITSEY
D: Thanks, Zack. Do you smell anything?
C: ZACK
D: No. Besides the guy's a flaming liberal.
N: Bitsey keeps looking down at the light.
C: BITSEY
D: A person's politics has nothing to do with their propensity to commit crime. Aren't we supposed to smell it if it's overheating?
E: beat
C: ZACK
D: Wrong, seventy-three percent of all serial killers vote republican.
C: BITSEY
D: Throw the cigarette out so we can smell.
N: Zack reaches for the car ashtray.
C: BITSEY
D: No! You'll stink up the car. Throw it out!
C: ZACK
D: I'm not gonna fucking pollute.
C: BITSEY
D: Zack!
N: Zack pinches the cherry off, lets it drop out the window. He shows her the filter, animatedly puts in the ash tray. She gives him a look. They ride a beat in silence. Bitsey sniffs.
C: BITSEY
D: We better pull off. Shit, this is so irritating.
C: ZACK
D: How far to Huntsville?
C: BITSEY
D: Look.
N: She points to an approaching rest area exit sign. They share a glance, then a laugh. Zack affects an evil, maniacal cackle.
C: ZACK
D: 'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom and Zack Stemmons entered the rest area with car trouble...
E: 'Hard Copy' announcer's voice
S: EXT. REST AREA EXIT - NIGHT
N: The car exits for the rest area.
C: ZACK
D: Little did they know their troubles were just beginning.
E: V.O.
N: Zack mimics the OPENING MUSIC to "Dark Shadows."
S: EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT
N: Well lit and empty. The rental car is parked with the hood up. They stand looking at the radiator.
C: BITSEY
D: Is it hot?
N: He puts his hand on it.
C: ZACK
D: Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always?
N: Bitsey shrugs.
C: ZACK
D: So what do I do?
C: BITSEY
D: I don't know, something male.
N: Zack animatedly adjusts his balls, spits.
C: ZACK
D: Now what?
N: Bitsey's not paying attention. She's watching headlights coming toward them.
C: BITSEY
D: Company.
C: ZACK
D: I hope whoever it is never saw Deliverance.
N: A late model pickup pulls up behind them. They shade their eyes from its headlights. The lights go off. An OLDER COWBOY (mid-60's, Stetson, lizard skin boots) steps out.
C: OLDER COWBOY
D: You folks need some help?
C: BITSEY
D: Actually yes.
S: EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NIGHT
N: The motel lies adjacent to Interstate 45 and a Kettle restaurant. The rental car pulls up to the reception building.
S: EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NEXT DAY
N: The rental car is parked in front. The morning is overcast, it's sprinkling. Bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the second floor carrying an umbrella.
S: INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Bitsey enters and sees Zack in a booth, smoking and reading. The hyper-smiley TEENAGE HOSTESS approaches her.
C: HOSTESS
D: How are you this morning?
N: Bitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment. She goes and sits across from Zack; he's reading Dialogical Exhaustion by David Gale.
C: BITSEY
D: Little early, isn't it?
C: ZACK
D: The non-smoking section's over there.
C: BITSEY
D: I meant the book.
C: ZACK
D: Oh.
N: Bitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down.
C: BITSEY
D: What time is it?
C: ZACK
D: 9:15. The waitress says the Ellis Unit is about fifteen minutes out of town, so we've got like five and half hours. I --
C: BITSEY
D: Never eat where the menus have pictures of the food.
C: ZACK
D: I was thinking we should drive to Austin, check out the crime scene. Could be some story stuff for us.
C: BITSEY
D: First, this isn't a story. It's an interview. We come, I listen, you watch, we go home. Second, there is no 'us' in the assignment.
E: without looking up
C: ZACK
D: Okay, what do I watch you do for the next five hours?
C: BITSEY
D: Drive around looking for decent restaurant.
E: closing the menu
C: ZACK
D: You know, your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you justice.
N: She's unsure how to interpret his comment. He smiles.
C: BITSEY
D: My reputation got us invited here. I play by the rules. It's called objectivity.
N: They stare at each other. Zack picks up his book, starts to read, affects a shiver.
S: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY
N: Drizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse is a sign: "TDC Ellis Unit. All visitors must report." SUPERIMPOSE: "DAY ONE" The rental car ENTERS the FRAME, brakes briefly for the empty guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison.
S: EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Bitsey and Zack get out of their car. She has an umbrella.
C: ZACK
D: So where do we report?
N: Three razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building with a sign: "REPORT HERE." Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the building. Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty yards away. He watches them neutrally. CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building. Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's) stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.
S: INT. ELLIS RECEPTION OFFICE
N: As Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a wait-just-a-second finger.
C: GROVER
D: Well, I don't rightly know one fraternity from another. But if we catch any those boys out here again, we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute... You do that, Susan... Bye now.
N: The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet. A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other. At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's). Grover hangs up.
C: GROVER
D: Thank you, Margie. Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I presume.
E: to the Woman turning to Bitsey and Zack
C: BITSEY
D: Yes, hello.
N: They shake hands.
C: ZACK
D: Stemmons.
C: GROVER
D: Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again. I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community relations.
N: Grover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach, his suit suggests J.C. Penny. He speaks quickly.
C: MARGIE
D: He's usually real good with names.
E: WOMAN
C: GROVER
D: And these days I always like to ask, now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?
E: to Bitsey
C: BITSEY
D: Bitsey.
C: GROVER
D: Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin' your umbrella.
C: MARGIE
D: Okey dokey.
S: EXT. ELLIS UNIT ENTRANCE
N: Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows, turns his collar up.
C: GROVER
D: Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
C: BITSEY
D: Yes.
N: Zack smiles to himself.
C: GROVER
D: On death row?
C: BITSEY
D: No.
C: GROVER
D: Well, we house 422 inmates here. Average stay with us is nine years. Some get commuted, move on, most get killed. It'll put you off your supper, but then it's supposed to.
N: The unit fence gate parts as they enter. The older gate guard nods as they pass.
C: GROVER
D: Afternoon, Earl. We've got three concerns here: safety, safety and safety. The visitation area is entirely secure -- we just ask you don't touch the glass. Windex gets expensive.
E: to the guard back to her
N: They come to the door of the entrance area.
C: GROVER
D: Rules say seven days prior to execution inmates must be interviewed in a cage.
N: The DOOR BUZZES, Grover opens it.
S: INT. ELLIS ENTRANCE LOBBY - DAY
N: The lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines. To one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal detector. They enter and make their way toward the counter.
C: GROVER
D: This changes for no man. You're not carryin' a weapon are you?
C: BITSEY
D: No.
C: GROVER
D: Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?
C: ZACK
D: No, sir.
N: They arrive at the counter. Behind it are two GUARDS, one male, one female.
C: GROVER
D: Clarence. Karla. New York guests for Mr. Gale.
E: to the guards
C: CLARENCE
D: May I see your purse, ma'am.
E: GUARD
C: GROVER
D: Go on and walk through.
E: to Bitsey, indicating the metal detector
N: Grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and waits for her.
C: GROVER
D: Now, should any kinda of unpleasantness occur in the visitation area, we ask that you stay put. Come on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please follow the instructions of these fine correctional officers should they see fit to give you any.
C: CLARENCE
D: Here you go, ma'am.
E: handing her the purse
N: He leads them down the hall.
C: GROVER
D: Anythin' you say can be overheard.
N: And any discussion of criminal activity on your part is admissible. Not plannin' a jailbreak are you, Bitsey?
S: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
N: The door guard gets up from his small table and opens the door for them.
C: GROVER
D: Here we are.
N: The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected by curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look like they are in a sound booth. Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's). On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.
C: GROVER
D: All yours, Mr. Belyeu. You folks have safe visit now.
E: calling out to Belyeu to Bitsey and Zack
C: BITSEY
D: Thank you.
N: He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet. Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard Yard.
C: BELYEU
D: Miss Bloom?
C: BITSEY
D: Yes.
N: Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly. David stands up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch.
C: BELYEU
D: Did that P.R. man validate your parkin'?
C: BITSEY
D: He said the gift shop could do it.
N: Belyeu laughs, smiles pure Old New Orleans charm.
C: BELYEU
D: She's a smart one.
E: to David
N: Belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.
C: BELYEU
D: Benjamin Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.
C: BITSEY
D: This is Zack.
C: BELYEU
D: Pleasure. And this is the man of the hour.
E: turning
N: They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really loudly) interrupts:
C: GUARD
D: Sit down, Gale.
E: V.O.
N: All wince. David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed.
C: DAVID
D: Hello.
C: BITSEY
D: Hello.
C: ZACK
D: Hi.
C: BELYEU
D: Now, why can't they turn that thing down?
C: DAVID
D: My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume.
E: to the microphone above him
N: A beat. They all look over at the guard's booth. One of the guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture.
C: DAVID
D: They're practicing being cruel and unusual.
C: BELYEU
D: Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit.
N: Belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.
C: BELYEU
D: Now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two-hour sessions. Today, tomorrow and Thursday, all at three in the P.M. I'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight. Furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind. You have my Gregg book?
E: to David
C: DAVID
D: I need it for Billy's appeal.
C: BELYEU
D: My client's got a ten pound bass on the line and he's worried about baitin' his neighbor's hook. Now, I have some papers for which I need your Jo Ann Hancock. Come by my Austin office at your earliest convenience. Thursday mornin', say.
E: to Bitsey takes out his planner handing her a business card
N: Bitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up at the microphone. She understands, nods.
C: BELYEU
D: Fine, till Thursday then.
N: Belyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards.
C: BELYEU
D: Good luck, Miss Bloom. I'll come by later. We can play a game of hangman, take up smokin'.
E: to David
N: David waves "get lost." Belyeu turns.
C: BELYEU
D: Bye, ya' all.
N: They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking at the floor, caught in a thought.
C: BITSEY
D: So...
C: DAVID
D: Sorry. Have a seat.
N: She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.
C: BITSEY
D: He's a character.
C: DAVID
D: Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass. We called it playing 'Execution.'
N: David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.
C: DAVID
D: Since I grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family I have.
C: BITSEY
D: Where's your ex-wife?
N: Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.
C: DAVID
D: We agreed minimal contact would be easier. Please don't mention her, or my son.
C: BITSEY
D: All right. Anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record.' I'll take it to my grave. But then you know that about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
N: David smiles, nods.
C: BITSEY
D: Is this recording equipment?
E: referring to the pen
N: He shrugs.
C: DAVID
D: How should we start?
C: BITSEY
D: I'd say you're a man with a story to tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the magazine, the format. You chose me.
N: She sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation.
C: BITSEY
D: Go.
N: David looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WHITE
T: DISSOLVE TO: TRANSITION MONTAGE
N: CAMERA starts TO ROTATE and ROLLS THROUGHOUT until the LAST SHOT COMES TO REST UPRIGHT. A) OVERHEAD Belyeu gets in his Cadillac in the wet Ellis Unit parking lot. B) ELLIS UNIT (RAINY DAY) from the air. C) AUSTIN FROM AIR (SUNNY DAY) D) OVERHEAD SEXY FEMALE GRAD STUDENT (over-dressed in a mini-skirt and heels) moves hurriedly through the University of Texas (U.T.) campus. E) FROM BEHIND TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS attending class in an U.T. lecture hall -- they are laughing as David entertains from a mike at the podium.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY
N: Thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to David lecture. He's younger (31), vibrant -- looks like a grad student himself. On the white board behind him are phrases: "Lucan," "objet petit a," "Fantasy Theory."
C: DAVID
D: Think. What do you fantasize about? World peace? Thought so. Money-Fame-Ferrari? A Pulitzer? Nobel? M.T.V. Music Award? A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but secretly simmering with noble passions, and willing to sleep on the wet spot?
E: as no one responds light laughter as some guys applaud loudly; others then boo them applause
N: As women applaud...
C: LARGE WOMAN
D: I'll take two!
E: yells
N: Laughter.
C: DAVID
D: A Victoria's Secret model -- just slumming between law school and running her family's Vastly Endowed Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed Children?
N: The crowd laughs, David changes tone.
C: DAVID
D: Okay, good, you see Lucan's point. Fantasies must be unrealistic. The minute you get something, you don't, you can't, want it anymore. To exist, desire needs absent objects. So desire supports itself with crazy fantasies...
N: The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a side door, out-of-breath and discombobulated. The crowd laughs at the timing. David pauses.
C: STUDENT
D: Sorry.
N: He animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she moves towards them.
C: DAVID
D: This is what Pascal means when he says the only time we're truly happy is when day-dreaming about future happiness.
N: The Sexy Student sits, adjusts herself.
C: DAVID
D: Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter than the kill' or 'Be careful what you wish for.'
N: A guy behind the Sexy Student taps her on the shoulder, she turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office. It's from a girl friend two rows back. The girlfriend mouths, "It came today?"
C: DAVID
D: Not because you'll get it, but because you're doomed not to want it if you do. Think about it next time you're at a wedding.
E: O.S.
N: Laughter. The Sexy Student turns back around, throws the letter in a book.
S: INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Students pour out of the double doors leading from David's class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him against the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes). She's looking at a document, holds a file.
S: INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY
N: The students are leaving. David is quickly erasing the white- board. The Sexy Student approaches him (her name is Berlin).
C: BERLIN
D: Sorry about being late. There was, you know, a thing.
E: SEXY STUDENT
C: DAVID
D: There usually is, Berlin.
C: BERLIN
D: Look, I know I'm not doing well.
N: He turns, nods, takes his books and papers from the podium.
C: BERLIN
D: And to torture a cliche, I'd do anything to pass.
N: He looks at her a beat, starts to walk toward the door.
C: BERLIN
D: Anything, Professor Gale.
N: He stops, turns.
C: DAVID
D: Anything, huh?
C: BERLIN
D: Anything.
E: suggestively
C: DAVID
D: Anything?
E: the smile
N: She affects a solicitous shyness -- then goes all sex.
C: BERLIN
D: Any thing.
N: He checks the room, then comes over to her, close.
C: DAVID
D: Tell you what, I'll give you good grade, a really good grade, if you will... ...study.
E: leans down to her ear, whispers sensually
N: He smiles, turns, walks away. As she watches, anger builds.
S: INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY
N: David comes out the room. Constance sees him, hurries to him. She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with absolute authority. They talk as they walk down the crowded hall.
C: CONSTANCE
D: David!
C: DAVID
D: Hey.
C: CONSTANCE
D: The T.A. finished transcribing the Governor's radio and TV comments. Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The woman breathes in soundbites.
N: She hands him a copy.
C: DAVID
D: 'Yes, Virginia, the people of this State have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of Santa.'
E: pretends to read a quote
C: CONSTANCE
D: You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff.
C: DAVID
D: Tell me again why you aren't doing the debate.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.
C: DAVID
D: I hadn't noticed.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I know.
C: DAVID
D: That's not what I meant.
S: EXT. U.T. CAMPUS - DAY
N: David and Constance exit the building into the sun.
C: CONSTANCE
D: She's gonna do the whole mother thing. She empathizes with you completely, but experience has given her the courage to take the tougher road, ta- da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And flirt politely.
C: DAVID
D: 'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for a woman who executed thirty eight last year.'
N: They've come to a sidewalk junction, stop.
C: CONSTANCE
D: And watch your ego. Don't come across as one of those I-hate-authority- because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types.
C: DAVID
D: Anything else?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Yeah, don't fall into one of your brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting new federal stats from Amnesty tonight.
C: DAVID
D: I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them to Sharon's number at the house.
N: She looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses.
C: CONSTANCE
D: If you have a hang-over tomorrow --
C: DAVID
D: Apropos playing Mother.
E: hangs up, walking away
C: CONSTANCE
D: Ten o'clock! Bright-eyed and bushy tailed!
E: calling after him beat
S: EXT. GALE HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
N: The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian, far better than what a university professor can afford. The grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway, his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front sits a new VW Beetle.
S: INT. KID'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: David's son -- CHASE -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep in the air. David turns off the light in the adjacent bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. David wears a t-shirt which says "Evil-Doer & Curious Person." The room is over-decorated with boy stuff.
C: DAVID
D: Did you mark your calendar?
C: CHASE
D: Yep.
E: looking up at it
N: INSERT - KID'S CALENDAR hangs above the bed, opened to the month of March. It has a felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it. Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the fourth. The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley face in an adult's. BACK TO SCENE
C: CHASE
D: Only... three more Spain days.
E: counting on his fingers
N: David puts the jeans and shoes away.
C: DAVID
D: Only three. That's great, huh?
N: David comes and sits beside his son. Points to an African statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table.
C: DAVID
D: What's he doing in here?
C: CHASE
D: Mommy said I could. Just till she gets back. That's a special-duper monster laser knife.
E: touching the spear
C: DAVID
D: Where's your laser gun?
N: Chase reaches under the sheets, searches, finally pulls out a laser pointer.
C: CHASE
D: Here.
N: He "shoots" some toys in the corner with the red laser dot.
C: CHASE
D: Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh. I never shoot them in the eyes, Daddy.
C: DAVID
D: That's 'cause you're a special-duper- super-quadruper boy. Who's now going to sleep.
N: He tucks his son in.
C: DAVID
D: Who loves you?
N: Chase giggles, points at his dad, then pokes his nose.
C: DAVID
D: Ooooh. Good night, son.
E: kissing him
C: CHASE
D: Do Cloud Dog.
E: holding up his stuffed sheep
C: DAVID
D: Good night, Cloud Dog.
E: kissing the sheep
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Obsessively cool, full of designer furniture and rough fabrics. The art is mostly contemporary and conspicuously lit -- a Damien Hirst piece sits in one corner. A few African antiquities are scattered throughout. A BABYSITTER sits on the couch reading a school textbook, holding lip gloss and absentmindedly applying it as she reads. David passes on his way to the door.
C: DAVID
D: Back before midnight.
C: BABYSITTER
D: It's cool, Mr. Gale. Don't do anything I wouldn't.
E: calling after him
C: DAVID
D: Rest assured.
E: O.S.
N: He exits. When she hears the DOOR CLOSE, the Babysitter reaches for the TV remote.
S: INT. DUPLEX - LIVING AREA - NIGHT
N: The duplex is upscale, two-story with a vaulted ceiling. Scattered about are forty party-goers, mostly grad students. Some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool. Everyone has a t-shirt with a philosophic idea ("Yawnic," "Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know," "[Philosophic t-shirt]".) LEONARD COHEN MUSIC PLAYS. FROM FRONT DOOR GREER (late 20s, Persian, "Host" t-shirt) escorts David into the living room.
C: GREER
D: The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the N.F.L. Consistent, accurate, effective, and boring, boring, boring.
N: Greer leaves him at the sofa where an OLDER PROFESSOR (60s, homemade t-shirt -- "Pre-Socratic" -- over his shirt and tie) stands speaking with ROSS (late 40s, "Homosexualist" t- shirt).
C: DAVID
D: Meinen Herren.
C: ROSS
D: Hello, David.
E: has an Oxford accent
C: OLDER PROFESSOR
D: Professor Gale. Where's your better half?
C: DAVID
D: Spain.
C: OLDER PROFESSOR
D: Again? Well, I was just off for air.
E: a beat
N: He moves to the patio. They watch him go.
C: DAVID
D: Looks like Sharon's affair is an open secret.
E: under his breath
C: ROSS
D: Hermeneutical bias: the only fun truths are the ones someone's trying to hide. Have a seat.
E: under his breath normal tone
N: They sit on the sofa.
C: ROSS
D: Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid. Probations suspended her. She received the letter today, took the opportunity to throw a fit in my office. You should --
C: BERLIN
D: Talking about me?
E: O.S.
N: She's standing behind them. David tilts his head back.
C: DAVID
D: Yep.
N: She's tipsy, brings her face down between their heads.
C: BERLIN
D: He tell you I said when you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part.
E: to David
C: DAVID
D: He mentioned it.
N: An uncomfortable beat. She reaches over and takes Ross's drink from his hand, drinks the rest, puts it back.
C: DAVID
D: It's called schmuck.
C: BERLIN
D: What?
C: DAVID
D: The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away. I think it's called schmuck.
C: BERLIN
D: Aren't we so fucking clever.
C: ROSS
D: I suppose I should get us another. David?
E: standing, escaping
C: DAVID
D: Black Bush.
N: Ross walks to the bar. Berlin comes around and sits in his seat. Her mid-drift T-shirt reads "Sex is Power."
C: BERLIN
D: You were a jerk this afternoon.
N: A beat. She's turned facing him, he looks forward.
C: DAVID
D: For what it's worth, I didn't know about the suspension.
C: BERLIN
D: Is that supposed to be an apology?
C: DAVID
D: More like a conciliation.
N: ON FOOD AND DRINKS TABLE Ross has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's Black Bush. He moves away. The table is neatly laid with snacks and bottles. The flower arrangement is perfect. SAME SCENE - LATER The table is now in mid-party chaos. Food spilled, bottles empty, the flowers in disarray. "I'M TOO SEXY" PLAYS LOUDLY in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from the table. CAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people now dance, and out onto the patio. A crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool. They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites.
C: ROSS
D: All right. As the poets have mournfully sung, Death takes the innocent young, The screamingly funny, The rolling in money, And those who are very well hung.
E: slurring a bit clears his throat
N: Laughter, a few animated moans. David raises his glass to Ross and downs a whiskey. Someone starts to chant: "Gale! Gale! Gale!"
C: DAVID
D: There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, Who took a young man to her room, And they argued all night, As to who had the right, To do what, how, and to whom.
E: feeling good but very much in control
N: Laughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks.
C: BERLIN
D: One more. C'mon, one more.
C: DAVID
D: Enough. That's enough.
N: The crowd wants more. Someone makes chicken sounds.
C: ROSS
D: Do you bow to the Queen?
N: David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his glass out for a refill. The crowd applauds. FULL SHOT OF PATIO The crowd is chanting: "Ross! Ross! Ross!" SAME SCENE - LATER The crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse. Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS. Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: David is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom.
C: DAVID
D: I'm done.
N: She locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed. He folds the towel.
C: BERLIN
D: I'm not a student anymore.
C: DAVID
D: Don't think I want to know what that means.
N: David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink -- they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom.
C: BERLIN
D: There once was woman named Berlin, Who liked a bit now and again. Not now and again, But Now! And Again! And Again! And Again! And Again!
N: He laughs.
C: BERLIN
D: Cute, huh?
C: DAVID
D: Cute.
C: BERLIN
D: I have a secret. But I have to come over there to tell you.
N: He makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward him.
C: BERLIN
D: Here I come.
N: She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter.
C: BERLIN
D: I wasn't after the grade.
E: whispering
N: She stands with her body against him, looks into his eyes.
C: DAVID
D: Berlin, this, this is not...
N: She puts her fingers over his mouth, keeps them there.
C: BERLIN
D: Ssshhhh.
N: With her free hand she takes one of his, rubs it against her face and lips as she speaks.
C: BERLIN
D: We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate. Or... you can put your mouth on my body.
N: She moves his hand down, brushing it against her breast and to her groin. She brings her mouth toward her fingers -- which are still against his lips.
C: BERLIN
D: Don't reject me. Please.
E: softly, vulnerably
N: With her eyes open, she kisses the back of her own fingers, runs her tongue between them, opens them to reach his mouth.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: A Hispanic woman (T-shirt: "DerriDa-Da") bee-bops to the bathroom door. Tries the handle, then dances away.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: About eight dancers dance to the TECHNO MUSIC -- its pace increasing. A couple them are really into it.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Berlin and David are against the sink, kissing in full passion. The MUSIC from downstairs seems LOUDER. Her T shirt is off. Panting, he turns her against the sink. Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties.
C: BERLIN
D: Rip them.
C: DAVID
D: What?
C: BERLIN
D: Rip them off.
N: He does so.
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head against the POUNDING MUSIC. Greer sets a cup of coffee in front of him, sits across. A long beat. They seem like parents waiting out a teenager's party.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Berlin is back against the sink, undoing David's fly as he takes his T-shirt off. The MUSIC from downstairs seems even LOUDER. His pants and underwear fall. He starts to penetrate her.
C: BERLIN
D: No. From behind.
N: She turns, faces the mirror. He positions himself behind, enters her.
C: BERLIN
D: Yes.
N: He moves against her.
C: BERLIN
D: Do it hard.
N: He looks at her in the mirror, then continues. She watches him. ON PATIO A guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger. The dancers can be seen in the living room behind him.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the edge of the sink. The MUSIC is as LOUD as it is downstairs.
C: BERLIN
D: Harder.
N: He looks at her in the mirror, unsure.
C: BERLIN
D: Harder.
N: He thrusts harder.
C: BERLIN
D: Yes.
N: They continue in rhythm. She reaches back and pulls him into her.
C: BERLIN
D: Bite me. Bite my shoulder.
N: She watches him do so in the mirror.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: The dancers dance -- the TECHNO PACE has INCREASED even more. One dancer is a blur.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax. She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks."
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: BLACK
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes into her bathroom.
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: She turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly, she turns to the toilette, vomits.
T: FADE TO:
N: BLACK.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. BARNES & NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
N: David and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the b.g. David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face. She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire. She has stacks of paper spread in front of her.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row. Wouldn't matter. Corrections would let him go. Governor Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch, the system works.' Yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in-your-face proof, we could demand abolition. Just like happened in England. Are you okay?
C: DAVID
D: Sorry. Yeah.
E: coming out of it
N: He makes an effort, plays the "good listener."
C: CONSTANCE
D: But it hasn't happened, not since '76. And won't happen.
N: David nods.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Dead men can't make a case.
C: DAVID
D: And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Just keep it rational. The death penalty is expensive and ineffective. No one wants to see a murderer as a victim.
C: DAVID
D: Um-hum.
C: CONSTANCE
D: And stop that.
C: DAVID
D: What?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Active listening. I hate active listeners. Makes me feel like I'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening. Did you bring the Amnesty fax?
C: DAVID
D: I can listen and appear to listen at the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I left it home.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I have a copy.
N: She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is looking out the window, caught in a thought.
C: CONSTANCE
D: You want to tell me what's up.
C: DAVID
D: Nothing. Everything. Something profoundly stupid happened last night.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I hope you used a condom.
E: teasing
N: A beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of yours?
N: A longer beat. He holds her eyes.
C: DAVID
D: It was Berlin.
N: She's stunned, then genuinely angry.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Oh, that's great, great. I can hear the grapevine now. They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience.
N: He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched.
C: CONSTANCE
D: A power differential equals coercion. Great. You are so weak.
C: DAVID
D: Constance, you're not my wife. Thank God.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I know you can tell yourself it's a position I aspire to, but believe me, I would rather...
N: She trails off. They stare at each other a beat. Then, she starts to collect the papers.
C: DAVID
D: I didn't mean --
C: CONSTANCE
D: Let's go.
N: As she collects, she winces, grabs her side.
C: DAVID
D: Are you okay?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Yes, let's just go.
S: INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - DAY
N: Two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles on sound stage. The main monitor is playing the end of the show's signation.
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: In three, two...
N: ON SOUND STAGE A camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie). The host is flanked by David and Governor Hardin. The set has an upscale regional television look. The Governor has the rare ability to look comfortable while David fidgets.
C: HOST
D: Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.' Tonight we continue our very special four-part series with the Governor Hardin. Arguing capital punishment with her is DeathWatch coordinator, Professor David Gale. Governor, you're up.
E: to camera
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: Alan, let me say somethin' I always say.
N: Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David -- something about the papers in front of him.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And that is I hate killin.' That's why my administration is willing to kill to stop it.
C: DAVID
D: So you don't subscribe to the idea that 'a good state is one that protects its most despised members'?
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: It's a nice liberal idea, but like most nice liberal ideas, naive.
C: DAVID
D: It's a quote from you, Governor, from your first state attorney campaign.
N: Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with her.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: You've got me, Professor. But let me, in my defense, give you a quote. Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a liberal at twenty, you've got no heart, if you're still a liberal at thirty, you've got no brain.'
N: The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance bites her lip.
C: DAVID
D: So, basically you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.'
N: The Governor makes an animated thinking face.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: Well, yes. I would have to agree. Did I say that, too?
E: chuckles again
C: DAVID
D: No, ma'am. That was Hitler.
N: Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Governor is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting her reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his tone more sincere.
C: DAVID
D: Governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working. That murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings. That it's expensive, inequably administered, that...
N: David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance.
C: DAVID
D: ...that we may even be killing innocents.
N: Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your game. Name one. Name one innocent man Texas has put to death in my tenure. One.
N: A beat. David doesn't respond.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: Name one in the last twenty years. In any state in this country.
N: A long, miserable beat.
C: HOST
D: Well, Mr. Gale?
C: DAVID
D: Dead men can't make a case.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: Well, as my daddy used to say: If you can't find a problem, there probably isn't one.
N: Constance shakes her head in irritation. BACKSTAGE - LATER The show is over. David and the Governor are shaking hands. Constance stands nearby.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: Well, you certainly had me on that Hitler quote.
C: DAVID
D: Thank you, Governor.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: These debates are awfully good for the state, don't you think?
C: DAVID
D: Of course.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: Well, I've got to buzz.
N: She moves toward her handlers.
C: GOVERNOR HARDIN
D: You folks keep up the good work. We need that opposition.
N: Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her.
S: EXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY
N: Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the parking lot.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Your exact words were, 'Just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work.' Now I'm telling you: Your ego's in the way of work.
C: DAVID
D: Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.
E: indicating the station
C: CONSTANCE
D: You put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate.
C: DAVID
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: CONSTANCE
D: It means DeathWatch suffers because you're so anxious to finger authority, to publicly prove that David Gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be. Learn to work without an audience. Try squeezing money from the donor list. Have you ever licked one single mail-out envelope?
N: They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s). MAN #2 (SUIT) Mr. Gale?
C: DAVID
D: Look, guys, there's not much more to say --
N: MAN #2 Rameriz, Austin police. This is Officer Haslinger. The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine it more closely.
C: DAVID
D: What, arguing with the Governor is a crime?
N: The officers exchange a look. MAN #3 (SUIT) No, sir, rape is. Constance and David look at each other, stunned. OVERHEAD SHOT CAMERA QUICKLY CRANES UP and ROTATES.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WHITE.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY
N: CAMERA CRANES DOWN and ROTATES, ENDING UPRIGHT BY Bitsey as she listens to David.
C: GUARD
D: Gale, time's up.
E: V.O. over the loudspeaker
N: The speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey. David nods over to the guard's booth.
C: DAVID
D: Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, ripped clothing. My skin was beneath her nails. It didn't look like anything but rape. Two days later she called the D.A., said she wouldn't testify, too drunk to be sure, etc. On the plane home, Sharon read about her husband's rape case being dropped.
C: BITSEY
D: Why'd she do it?
N: A guard approaches. David stands up and moves to the back of his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the back to be handcuffed.
C: DAVID
D: Finger authority, show she was smarter than the powers that be.
E: shrugs
C: BITSEY
D: Do you know where I can find her?
C: DAVID
D: First year in here I received a card postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't signed, but I suspect it was from her -- the front had the text 'Sex is Power.'
N: Cuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened.
C: BITSEY
D: Anything written on it?
C: DAVID
D: Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you can know.' See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom.
E: exiting the cage
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms. Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the lot is wet.
C: BITSEY
D: Try phone records, a net search.
C: ZACK
D: Fucking better than watching you work.
N: They walk a beat in silence.
C: ZACK
D: You think he's telling the truth?
C: BITSEY
D: Don't ask me that. I don't know. There is no truth, only perspectives.
C: ZACK
D: Can't say that. If you say 'there is no truth,' you're claiming it's true that there is no truth -- it's a logical contradiction.
C: BITSEY
D: Working on our philosophy merit badge, Zack?
C: ZACK
D: I, on the other hand, think Gale's telling the truth.
N: They come to the stairs and start up.
C: BITSEY
D: This you know telepathically?
C: ZACK
D: It's just my perspective.
N: In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels the music.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
N: The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair. It's an overcast day. Zack drives, slowly, searching. Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her eyes closed. SUPERIMPOSE: DAY TWO.
C: ZACK
D: Thirty-three o what?
C: BITSEY
D: Seven. 'Check out the crime scene in Austin.' You made it sound so close. Shit, two and half hours and that damn lig --
E: then
C: ZACK
D: Bitsey.
N: She looks up. Zack is pointing at house 3307, which needs paint and a lawn mower. In front of the house is a homemade sign which reads, "David Gale Death House and Museum" See where it happened!" Beneath are the opening hours (12-8); someone has marked them out and scribbled "ring bell." They share a look.
S: EXT. PORCH OF HOUSE 3307 - DAY
N: Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, points out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen. She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within. The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable silence, Bitsey extends her hand.
C: BITSEY
D: Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is Zack Stemmons. We --
C: GOTH GIRL
D: You want the tour?
N: Her voice is slacker monotone.
C: BITSEY
D: Uh, yes.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: There's a twenty-dollar mandatory donation, apiece. But you get a re- enactment photo packet. It's got five pictures.
C: BITSEY
D: Okay.
N: A beat.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: I gotta collect first.
C: BITSEY
D: Oh, sure.
N: Bitsey reaches in her bag.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: They enter. The room is dark, messy, with an old couch and TV/VCR. A kitchen is adjacent. The walls are full of Goth bric-a-brac: London Batcave poster, one from Burton's Frankenweenie, a couple of fan-zine pictures of Siouxsie and the Banshees. In one corner is a very expensive STEREO, from which THE CURE plays. In another, a dead plant. The Goth Girl turns the MUSIC DOWN. A table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and curling sheet of plastic. Small packets of snapshots sit on the table along with a few hand-labelled videos and a book of clippings. There's also a guest book.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: You gotta sign the book. Doesn't have to be your real name, though.
N: Bitsey signs in.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: First page says you're here to do research on violent crime. The state requires it for nonprofit shit.
N: Zack signs in.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: Take a re-enactment photo packet.
N: Bitsey does so. As does Zack.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: If you guys could share one, it would be really cool. The butt wipes where I do prints kinda jerk my chain.
N: Zack puts his back. Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: That's me. My boyfriend took it. We also did a video. It's fifty bucks 'cause you can see my tits. There's a version without tits, that's thirty- five.
N: Zack looks at a video, hand-labelled: "Constance Harraway Murder (with breasts)! Copyright 1997! Svengali Productions!"
C: BITSEY
D: Do many people take the tour?
C: GOTH GIRL
D: Not so much anymore. We thought this would be like a busy week -- Gale gettin' the prune juice and all. Prune juice is what death row dudes call the poison, 'cause it gives you the shits. Most jerks just take a photo from the street. They shot a 'Real Crimes' episode here, but the owner didn't give us dick.
C: ZACK
D: You don't mind living here?
C: GOTH GIRL
D: I'm cool with ghouls. Beats livin' with my dickwad parents. It starts over here.
N: She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: She let him crash here sometimes. He was like constantly wasted. Drank Black Label religiously.
N: Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around. By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined and indexed (#2).
C: GOTH GIRL
D: This is where the tripod was. My boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks. They never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything. Gale must have buried them. These serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later.
C: ZACK
D: He's not exactly a serial killer.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: Whatever.
N: She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter (#6).
C: GOTH GIRL
D: She was like totally naked right here. The meter man saw her through the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe. My boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her. Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better. He used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints. They found sticky stuff from the tape on them.
E: pointing
N: Zack picks up the gloves.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: We ask folks not to touch the exhibit.
C: ZACK
D: Right.
N: He puts them back.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: The totally sick part was where they found the key --
C: BITSEY
D: We know, you can save that.
C: ZACK
D: What? Where was it?
C: GOTH GIRL
D: It was in her stomach, dude. He made her swallow it before he bagged her.
N: A beat. Zack's shocked.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: That's pretty much the highlight.
N: Got questions?
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
N: Bitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville. Zack smokes out the window.
C: BITSEY
D: It was in the case file.
C: ZACK
D: Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder than Wisconsin.
C: BITSEY
D: Zack, open your vanity.
E: looking in the rearview mirror
C: ZACK
D: What?
C: BITSEY
D: The vanity mirror, pull it down.
N: He does so.
C: BITSEY
D: See that truck behind us?
C: ZACK
D: Yeah.
C: BITSEY
D: Isn't that the cowboy from the rest area?
N: They look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind them is the older cowboy in his pickup.
C: ZACK
D: Same truck.
C: BITSEY
D: Weird coincidence, huh?
C: ZACK
D: Coincidences are always weird, that's why they're coincidences.
E: turning
S: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
N: Bitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking in hushed tones. A beat.
C: DAVID
D: Off-the-record?
C: BITSEY
D: Alright, we're off.
C: DAVID
D: Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method. You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article. The prosecution never knew.
C: BITSEY
D: You're telling me someone's framing you?
C: DAVID
D: It's more than that.
C: DAVID
D: There was a tripod.
C: BITSEY
D: Right, facing her body. Are we on?
C: DAVID
D: Not a single print was found on it. Someone brought it, wiped it, left it. Why? It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there.
E: nods agreement
C: BITSEY
D: Maybe you're being paranoid?
C: DAVID
D: Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row activist on death row. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
N: A beat. She nods.
C: BITSEY
D: Any ideas who 'they' are?
C: DAVID
D: No.
N: A beat.
C: DAVID
D: But I have someone on it, someone I'm hoping will one day find an answer.
C: BITSEY
D: Belyeu's hired a detective?
N: He shakes his head.
C: DAVID
D: A journalist.
N: It takes Bitsey a second to understand. David smiles.
C: DAVID
D: 'She's a smart one.'
E: mimicking Belyeu
N: ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM OUT TO LONG SHOT.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WHITE.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. U.T HALLWAY - LONG SHOT - DAY
N: ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM IN. David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's concentrated; she's biting her lip. They're looking onto a large parking lot. The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase, who stand near their Jeep. It's packed with various household items, things not entrusted to movers.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I'll drop by your office after.
N: He nods and goes out.
S: EXT. U.T. PARKING LOT - DAY
N: As David approaches them, Chase runs to them -- still carrying Cloud Dog. He jumps on his dad.
C: CHASE
D: Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me like a fur!
N: As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders (like a fur). Chase squeals with pleasure.
C: DAVID
D: Who's your hero?
N: Chase bonks him on the nose. David sets Chase down when he reaches his WIFE. He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles to move on to something else. A long beat as David and his wife stand uncomfortably.
C: DAVID
D: Call me when you get to Boston?
C: SHARON
D: Yeah.
E: WIFE
N: A beat.
C: DAVID
D: I wish you --
C: SHARON
D: Don't.
N: She turns and walks to the Jeep. The door's open.
C: SHARON
D: Chase, get in, Sweetie.
N: Chase climbs in, sits in the driver's seat.
C: CHASE
D: See ya later, Alli-gator.
E: turning to his dad
C: DAVID
D: After awhile, Crocodile.
C: CHASE
D: Take it easy, Japa-ne-se.
C: DAVID
D: Okey-dokey, Artichokey.
C: SHARON
D: Scoot.
E: to Chase
N: Chase scoots over to the passenger seat. Sharon gets in the driver's seat.
C: SHARON
D: I sent you an e-mail.
C: DAVID
D: Okay?
C: SHARON
D: Just read it.
N: She closes the door. Suddenly, Chase opens the passenger side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog. He runs to his dad, hugs him one last time.
C: SHARON
D: Come on, Chase.
E: cracking her window
N: Chase starts to go back, turns and hands David his Cloud Dog without comment. He then quickly runs back around the Jeep and gets in. David watches them drive away. Chase's hand waves out the window until they are out of the parking lot. INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN with an e-mail message: "David, I want a divorce. I'm sorry to say it so plainly, but that's how I feel it. I don't need time to think, this whole 'rape' thing has only forced..."
S: INT. DAVID'S U.T. OFFICE - DAY
N: David sits in front of his computer, staring into space. The office is institutional, cramped. Books line the walls, fill the desk. There's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates. He reaches into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass. There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters.
C: CONSTANCE
D: You could at least hide the bottle.
N: David closes the e-mail. She collapses in the chair opposite his desk, exhausted.
C: DAVID
D: Well?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Officially, you're on sabbatical. Unofficially, they want you to look for another position. It was four to two.
N: A beat as he absorbs the information.
C: DAVID
D: How did Ross vote?
C: CONSTANCE
D: You're not supp... Against you.
N: David nods.
C: DAVID
D: And you?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Against my politics.
N: David mouths a "thank you."
S: EXT. GALE HOUSE - DAY
N: A Century 21 real estate agent is putting a "For Sale" sign in the front yard.
S: INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - DAY
N: David is having lunch with an IVY LEAGUE-LOOKING MALE in his fifties. Only water and bread are on the table.
C: DAVID
D: So, I wanted to get your feedback on the idea.
N: The Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread.
C: IVY LEAGUER
D: Look, Professor Gale, I could sit here, as I'm sure others have, and plead departmental cutbacks. Claim you need more publications, or I need a minority, whatever. All bull- geschichte. Your record's brilliant. You're an original voice worth -- in the scarcity-defines-value capitalist system under which we toil -- your weight in gold. Hell, it's not even the alcohol. It'd be nice to have faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac. But, to speak plainly, if I hire you, in the eyes of the regents, alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a rapist.
N: He takes a bite of bread.
C: IVY LEAGUER
D: You're not politically correct, Dr. Gale. Welcome to the club.
S: EXT./INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: David stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a- month apartment. Books are stacked everywhere. An Interstate runs nearby. He holds a phone, looks down in the pool area. DAVID'S POV A horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo) attempts to do Tai Chi.
C: CHASE
D: We aren't home. Please, tell us a message.
E: V.O. on his mom's answering machine
C: SHARON
D: At the beep.
E: V.O. cueing him in the b.g.
C: CHASE
D: At the peep.
E: V.O.
N: ON DAVID David lets the PHONE BEEP, just stares down at the man, saying nothing.
S: EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT - DAY
N: As David gets out of his Volvo, a SORORITY PLEDGE (funny clothes, Greek letters on her cheek) quickly approaches. She takes his picture with a Polaroid camera. She runs to a waiting convertible, where two other girls sit.
C: SORORITY PLEDGE
D: I got it! I got it!
N: She jumps in the car and they speed away.
S: INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - DAY
N: The office is Philip Stark chic with large window walls -- Austin stretches into the distance. David sits on a sofa across from an exceedingly ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (early 40s).
C: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
D: What exactly attracts you to the bond market?
N: He's staring into space.
C: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
D: Mr. Gale?
N: He looks at her. She forces a strained smile.
S: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Dark. David lies on the floor, his head propped against a wall. He's in his underwear and drinking from a Black Bush bottle. The phone's beside his ear and Chase's MESSAGE on his wife's MACHINE TWEAKS out of the receiver speaker. After the BEEP, David hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches re- dial. The MESSAGE STARTS again. After the BEEP, he hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches re-dial.
S: INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY
N: David is in the office of an overdressed YUPPIE BLACK MAN (early 20s). David is doing his active listening thing.
C: YUPPIE MAN
D: Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me three personal qualities you have that would make you a successful Radio Shack manager.
E: over-articulating
S: EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
N: David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green.
C: BELYEU
D: Because divorce proceedings do not require her presence in the country. For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll have to return.
N: David chooses a club.
C: BELYEU
D: But without successful completion of an alcohol treatment program, you'll be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.
N: David walks to the ball.
C: DAVID
D: So my chances of getting partial custody aren't good?
C: BELYEU
D: Roughly the same as you sinkin' that from here.
N: David looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly it has meaning. He swings. The ball lands in a water trap.
S: INT. PICTURESQUE MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY
N: David's Volvo winds up the road, enters through a gate. A sign beside the gate: "The Go lightly: A Recovery Clinic."
T: FADE TO:
N: BLACK.
T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - DAY
N: It's a beautiful day. The house looks much different than in the Goth Girl's care -- flower bed, well-manicured lawn, fresh paint. The "Block Home" sign is in the window. David's Volvo pulls up in front.
S: INT./EXT. CONSTANCE'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY
N: Constance opens the door for David. He's wearing a short sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie. She's taken aback. Looks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I'm sorry.
N: He plays hurt, then they both burst out laughing. LONG SHOT - CONSTANCE AND DAVID She hugs him as they laugh on the porch.
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding door is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads David in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. Her hair is different.
C: CONSTANCE
D: You look good.
C: DAVID
D: I feel... washed.
N: She smiles at him maternally, touches his face. They hug again.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I need you. DeathWatch needs you, now more than ever.
E: lightly, in his arms
C: DAVID
D: Nothing like I need you, both. You're all I have.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Look.
N: She moves from him, takes a photo from a case file on her kitchen table.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled.
N: INSERT - PHOTO of a young black women -- pleasant, timid. BACK ON SCENE
C: CONSTANCE
D: I've got a call with Hawkins tonight, and if national will commit emergency funds...
N: She lifts a small plant, moves to the porch.
C: DAVID
D: Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll only prove the system works.
N: He notices she has bruises on her arms.
C: CONSTANCE
D: But I'll save a life.
C: DAVID
D: Where'd you get those?
E: referring to the bruises
C: CONSTANCE
D: Spring cleaning.
S: EXT. CONSTANCE'S PORCH
C: CONSTANCE
D: She went up at 18, she's 26 now.
N: She sets the plant down among others. At the very back of the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden.
C: DAVID
D: Hey! She ever not make you work when you come by?
E: calling to the Cowboy
C: OLDER COWBOY
D: Mornin', David.
E: raising his spade in greeting
C: DAVID
D: What's her story?
E: turning to Constance
C: CONSTANCE
D: I really want us to get behind this one. She's articul --
C: DAVID
D: Constance, who did she kill?
N: Constance looks at him a beat, sighs.
C: CONSTANCE
D: A cop.
C: DAVID
D: She admit to it?
N: Contance sheepishly nods.
C: DAVID
D: You're a crazy woman. Not your medium grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane.
C: CONSTANCE
D: You're mixing metaphors.
C: DAVID
D: A real danger to flora and fauna.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Are we gonna do this?
C: DAVID
D: And how.
E: the smile
N: He kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised.
C: DAVID
D: You're burning up.
S: EXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT
N: David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup- container, tries to sip one without spilling the others. He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier. In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back, waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic DOOR-LOCK BUTTON.
S: INT. OFFICE OF DEATHWATCH (AUSTIN) - NIGHT
N: David enters carrying the coffee. The matron sits on a desk licking envelopes. The college guy is on the floor beneath a desk rewiring a computer terminal.
C: COLLEGE GUY
D: Howdy, Mr. Gale.
E: calling from beneath a desk
C: DAVID
D: Hello, folks.
N: David goes to the Matron, gives her cup and three Sweet & Lows.
C: MATRON
D: Hello. My, this is service. Thank you.
C: DAVID
D: Gladly.
N: He takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack, then puts a cup beside the legs of the College Guy.
C: DAVID
D: Latte on your left, partner.
N: David makes his way to the back office. The College Guy gives the Matron a look -- they're surprised, pleased.
S: INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY
N: Constance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls, though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talking on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national director -- a social gathering is going on behind him.
C: DIRECTOR
D: ...and see what kind of resources the religious groups can deliver.
E: V.O.
N: David comes through the door. She waves him in.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I'm sure we can get some pulpit time, maybe cable.
N: He sets her coffee in front of her. Then sits across from her.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Cable's good. Listen, I need to run. For now, I agree the first press release should focus on the woman's youth.
E: V.O.
N: David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then animatedly licks and seals it. He then, literally, pats himself on the back.
C: DIRECTOR
D: I'll have the Washington people look into counsel competency, though I'm almost sure she's exhausted this issue on appeal.
E: V.O.
N: She smiles at him, shakes her head.
C: CONSTANCE
D: John, David's going to --
E: to the phone
C: DIRECTOR
D: Oh, I almost forgot. He's not around, is he?
E: V.O.
N: Constance hesitates, looks at David. He shakes his head no.
C: CONSTANCE
D: No.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Good, keep it that way. His relationship to DeathWatch is over, terminated. Last thing we need is this rape thing coming back to bite our butts.
E: V.O.
N: Constance is not sure how to react. David just stares at her.
C: DIRECTOR
D: These guys don't stay on the wagon for very long.
E: V.O.
N: David stands up and leaves the room, quickly. His coffee spills. Constance can only watch.
C: DIRECTOR
D: I'm serious, Constance. Ban him from the premises. I realize you two...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. DEATHWATCH OFFICE (AUSTIN) - NIGHT
N: Constance comes anxiously out the front door. CONSTANCE'S POV David's Volvo pulls out of the parking lot. BACK TO SCENE She stands watching it drive away, breathing heavily. She winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk.
S: EXT. AUSTIN STREET - NIGHT
N: The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street: There's a liquor store. CLOSEUP - RECEIVER at his ear, Chase's MESSAGE BEGINS. BACK ON DAVID He speaks into the PHONE after the BEEP.
C: DAVID
D: Sharon, pick up. For once just pick up the goddamn phone! If you keep him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging you. He's my son! Please! Please.... Please.
N: David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand bleeds.
S: EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NEXT DAY
N: Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks. David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign, holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy drunk.
C: DAVID
D: We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Come on, come inside.
N: She opens the door as he stands.
C: DAVID
D: We fell off our wagon.
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of the couch, holding the sheep.
C: DAVID
D: Know why Saint Jude is the patron saint of lost causes? 'Cause his real name was Judas. There were two Judases, Judai, the saint guy and the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, and tried to kiss him. Medievalers wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear of getting bad Judas on the line by mistake. Ergo, they only gave him business when really desperate. That's why. Then they changed his name.
N: She's not in the room.
C: DAVID
D: Constance?
N: He looks back toward the entry hall. A small flyer lightly blows along the floor into the living room.
C: DAVID
D: Your mail's blowing.
N: He looks in the entry hall. ENTRY HALL Constance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door. The mail is scattered about her.
S: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: David sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack of vending-machine coffee cups. A typical hospital INTERCOM can be heard throughout the scene. A female DOCTOR (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes his shoulder. He wakes, groggy.
C: DOCTOR
D: How we doing?
C: DAVID
D: Fine. How's Constance?
C: DOCTOR
D: Sleeping.
N: A beat as he collects himself, sits up.
C: DOCTOR
D: Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's condition is highly susceptible to external stress. While we don't want to totally restrict Constance's life --
C: DAVID
D: What?
C: DOCTOR
D: Constance's illness requires a degree of regularity.
C: DAVID
D: Constance has leukemia?
C: DOCTOR
D: Acute. She was diagnosed last fall.
N: A beat as the situation clarifies for both of them. David is stunned, the doctor embarrassed.
C: DOCTOR
D: Have I created a problem?
C: DAVID
D: No, no.
N: They sit in silence. The hospital intercom seems to say:
C: GUARD
D: Gale, time's up.
E: V.O.
N: CLOSEUP - DAVID CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WHITE.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - CLOSEUP - BITSEY - DAY
N: CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. Bitsey stares at David, engrossed.
C: DAVID
D: When I asked why she hadn't told me, she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess she figured as long as death was chasing her, she could help others escape.
N: He stands, goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.
C: DAVID
D: Constance left the world better than she found it. It's a small, difficult thing.
E: beat
S: EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY
N: The rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
N: Zack waits in the driver's seat, smoking. He looks nervously through the windshield toward the pens. Bitsey raps on the window, startling him.
C: ZACK
D: Fuck.
N: Zack unlocks the door, throws his cigarette out. Bitsey opens the door and gets in.
C: ZACK
D: Hey.
C: BITSEY
D: For God's sake, Zack.
E: waving her hand at the smoke
C: ZACK
D: You're not a happy camper.
C: BITSEY
D: It's not a happy place.
N: He STARTS the CAR.
C: ZACK
D: Talked to the Austin prosecutor. Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he fucked up the penalty phase, says Gale probably would have gotten life on mitigating factors. Gale stuck with him, though, all through appeals, despite major pro bono offers.
C: BITSEY
D: What else?
C: ZACK
D: Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money in Houston tonight, overheat light came on twice, and you're about to get a surprise.
C: BITSEY
D: I don't want a surprise.
C: ZACK
D: Too late.
E: pointing ahead
S: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY
N: The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down. Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car. All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where another Highway patrol car is stationed. The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive. The rental car ENTERS the FRAME.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR
N: Bitsey and Zack approach the guardhouse.
C: ZACK
D: This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan. I got stuck behind them on the way in.
N: The guardhouse attendant looks in, waves them through as the crossing guard lifts.
C: ZACK
D: Execution's not for another 36 hours. It's gonna be a zoo. There's the P.R. guy.
N: Standing among the six people in ponchos is Duke Grover. They pass him in SLOW MOTION. He sees them, smiles, makes a "Hello" shooting-gesture.
C: BITSEY
D: What a life, waiting around for someone to die.
C: ZACK
D: Fuck, look.
N: The next-to-last vehicle on the left is the Older Cowboy's pickup. He sits inside talking with another man. The Older Cowboy sees them, touches his hat as they pass.
C: BITSEY
D: This is a little too coincidental.
S: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY
N: The rental car passes a farmhouse.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR
N: Bitsey and Zack are headed to Huntsville.
C: ZACK
D: 'Cause I couldn't see the license plate.
C: BITSEY
D: Forget it. What time is it?
C: ZACK
D: 6:05. Why don't you have a watch?
C: BITSEY
D: It's a long story.
S: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY
N: The rental car passes a black teenager hitchhiking in front of an abandoned vegetable stand.
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY
N: Bitsey and Zack make their way to their rooms. Zack's is first.
C: BITSEY
D: Give me an hour.
S: INT. ZACK'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY
N: Zack unlocks his door, enters. The room's a mess, papers everywhere. He walks toward a portable computer sitting on the room desk.
C: BITSEY
D: Zack!
N: Zack runs from the room.
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY
N: Zack runs towards Bitsey. She stands outside her room.
C: ZACK
D: What!?
C: BITSEY
D: It's open.
C: ZACK
D: So? Maybe the maid forgot.
C: BITSEY
D: Look!
E: pointing
N: As he comes to her door, he sees what she's indicating: Between the door and its frame, someone has stuck a roll of duct tape.
S: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY
N: Bitsey pushes the door open, looks in and around. She sees something, enters. Zack enters behind her, sees what she sees.
C: ZACK
D: I'll check the bathroom.
N: He goes. She approaches the middle of the room. The room, in contrast to Zack's, is perfectly neat. It has two twin beds. The nightstand has been moved to the center. On it is a lamp, turned on. Suspended just above the lamp, a VHS cartridge hangs from the ceiling by fishing line. BITSEY'S BATHROOM Zack checks behind the shower curtain.
C: ZACK
D: Clear in here! Don't touch it!
N: BACK IN BEDROOM As Zack enters, he sees Bitsey holding the VHS Cassette.
C: ZACK
D: Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been prints.
C: BITSEY
D: Look.
N: She holds up the cassette. It has a label typed from an old typewriter: "For Bitsey Bloom."
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX RECEPTION - DUSK
N: Zack runs out the front door carrying a VCR, the cables drag the ground behind him. He runs toward the rooms.
S: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK
N: Bitsey unlocks the door, lets Zack in.
C: ZACK
D: She says no one asked for you. And all the room keys are different.
N: He goes to the TV.
C: ZACK
D: Just she and her husband have masters.
C: BITSEY
D: What did you tell her?
C: ZACK
D: That you have a jealous boyfriend.
N: He starts to hook up the VCR.
C: BITSEY
D: Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?
C: ZACK
D: She didn't ask. I think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous. I still say we should do this in my room -- this one's a fucking crime scene.
C: BITSEY
D: Whoever got in here -- without a key in broad daylight -- was probably smart enough not to leave prints. I have the remote.
N: He turns ON the TV.
C: ZACK
D: Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try three.
C: BITSEY
D: They don't look for D.N.A. when someone breaks in to deliver, Zack. Here.
E: hitting the remote
N: She hands him the tape. He starts to put it in, hesitates, looks back at her.
C: ZACK
D: You sure you want to see what's on here?
C: BITSEY
D: No. Start it.
N: He puts it in, pushes play. She sits on the bed. He sits beside her. They watch the black leader appear.
C: BITSEY
D: I hope this isn't what I think it is.
N: CLOSEUP - TV An image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera. An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the neck with duct tape. Her hands are handcuffed behind her. She appears dead.
C: BITSEY
D: God, no.
E: O.S.
C: ZACK
D: Fuck. Is it her?
E: O.S.
C: BITSEY
D: Turn it up.
E: O.S.
N: BACK TO SCENE They stare at the screen, she bites a thumbnail. He turns the sound up.
S: INT. HOUSE 3307 - KITCHEN - DAY (ON TV)
N: Hi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged. Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner of the screen is part of what looks like a towel. The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER. Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black.
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK
N: Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon. After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her.
C: ZACK
D: Belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow. Also said you were right about not calling the police.
N: A beat, she keeps looking straight on.
C: ZACK
D: Are you gonna be okay?
N: Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes. She shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts his arms around her as she starts to cry.
S: INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes. The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they wait until she leaves. Hushed tones.
C: ZACK
D: Let's say Gale's right. Some sick- fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him up, arranged like the perfect murder. Why send a magazine journalist proof a few hours before he's won? Doesn't make sense.
C: BITSEY
D: No, it's perfect. He knows News Magazine won't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news, not after having paid for it. Probably guessed we wouldn't call the cops. And, most importantly, knows I'll tell Gale tomorrow.
C: ZACK
D: Why does he give a shit?
C: BITSEY
D: Zack, what if Harraway's murder was just a means to getting Gale. I mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game. You kill the one person he has left. Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder -- a place he's made a public career of loathing. And then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust. You destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory -- and you make him watch.
C: ZACK
D: That's a lot of hate. You're talking beyond sadism.
N: Bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need-I-say-more face.
C: ZACK
D: Then why release it?
C: BITSEY
D: If the mouse dies the game's over. Maybe the cat's enjoying himself. Or...
C: ZACK
D: Or?
C: BITSEY
D: Imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists.
E: picks up the tape
C: ZACK
D: The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath.
C: BITSEY
D: Yeah, but smart.
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT
N: The storm batters the motel. We see Bitsey's dark front window. Lightning. A figure stands looking out. More lightning. It's Bitsey, intently watching the night.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
N: SUPERIMPOSE: DAY THREE On the back seat is an aluminum suitcase. Zack sits beside it looking out the back window. Bitsey drives. It's still raining, hard. They're on the two-lane highway to Austin.
C: ZACK
D: Why do they call it check-book journalism if we always pay cash?
N: CLOSE ON DASH The over-heat light is on. BACK TO SCENE
C: ZACK
D: Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock!
C: BITSEY
D: Is it the truck?
N: ZACK'S POV The cowboy's truck can be seen through the tire mist fifty yards behind them.
C: ZACK
D: Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding.
N: Bitsey watches in the rearview mirror. Zack out the back window.
C: ZACK
D: He must think we're idiots. You think he's our fucked-up feline?
N: Bitsey doesn't respond, just watches in the mirror, then:
C: BITSEY
D: Is he gaining?
C: ZACK
D: No. Just sitting back there.
C: BITSEY
D: Can you see the license?
C: ZACK
D: Too much mist. What the fuck does this guy want?
S: INT. LAW OFFICE OF BENJAMIN BELYEU - DAY
N: The office has a view of the rain-soaked capital. Expensively decorated. Dark woods and deep carpets -- Belyeu's practice is clearly thriving. A sharp-looking CLERK sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum suitcase. Bitsey sits on a huge sofa. Belyeu stands just outside his door.
C: BELYEU
D: Fine. Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's original when that's done. Don't blame you for not watching that twice.
E: O.S. entering, to Bitsey
N: He goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers.
C: BITSEY
D: I couldn't sleep afterwards.
C: BELYEU
D: I understand. I generally tell folks I'm no more afraid of the grim reaper than I am of a Presbyterian on Mother's Day. But watching your tape... well. I had to keep tellin' myself 'that's not Constance' just to get through. Unfortunately, others may argue the same.
E: a beat
C: BITSEY
D: Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her house.
C: BELYEU
D: Currently home to Weirdos Incorporated. Arguably, that tape could have been made by anybody with twenty dollars and a tolerance for vulgarity.
C: BITSEY
D: But it will at least get us a postponement?
C: BELYEU
D: I hope so, Miss Bloom, I certainly hope so. But you've got to remember that there's a machine a runnin'. And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin' that machine wants to be fed.
N: The Clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase.
C: CLERK
D: All here, Mr. Belyeu.
C: BELYEU
D: Thank you, Joshua. To add to our troubles, your own credibility may come into question.
E: to the Clerk to Bitsey
N: The Clerk exits.
C: BITSEY
D: Why?
C: BELYEU
D: You've been fraternizin' with the condemned. In the court's eyes, he's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape. He's a persuasive man, you're a out-of-state woman -- it don't look good on paper.
C: BITSEY
D: But someone put it in my hotel room.
C: BELYEU
D: A fact for which we have no evidence.
N: A very professional-looking assistant enters, hands Bitsey her video.
C: BELYEU
D: Thank you, Bobbi.
C: BITSEY
D: Thanks.
C: BELYEU
D: Well, let's not start readin' Kafka just yet. Could we find a sympathetic judge. I'll file within the hour. You headin' back over to Ellis?
E: standing
C: BITSEY
D: Yeah.
E: standing
C: BELYEU
D: Fine. I'll call over at the motel later and give you an update.
S: INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY
N: Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold "Belyeu and Crane" sign. She turns a corner. At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator, pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an adjacent window at the capital in the rain. She remembers something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella.
C: BITSEY
D: Shit.
N: She heads back toward Belyeu's office. As she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the Belyeu and Crane office.
S: EXT. AUSTIN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
N: Bitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental car parked in the loading zone.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
N: Bitsey opens the door. Zack's in the passenger seat. She doesn't bother to sit.
C: BITSEY
D: Did you see the cowboy go in?
C: ZACK
D: He went in Belyeu's building?
C: BITSEY
D: Into his office. Just saw him.
C: ZACK
D: Fuck!
C: BITSEY
D: Follow him. Find out who he is, where he lives -- what he --
C: ZACK
D: How are you gonna get to Ellis?
C: BITSEY
D: A taxi.
N: Zack makes a face.
S: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE - DAY
N: A taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and press that now gather along the drive.
S: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
N: Bitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David. She's upset.
C: DAVID
D: Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to sit.
N: Over the loudspeaker:
C: GUARD
D: Visitors need to stay seated.
E: V.O.
N: She sits.
C: DAVID
D: Sorry. Look at me. He's not your man. His name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch Director before Constance. He's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs don't mean shit.' They fired him. Constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it. The man adored her.
E: to the microphone above to Bitsey
C: BITSEY
D: Then why was he following us? Why was he at Belyeu and Crane?
C: DAVID
D: He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U. cases together, until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court. Benny sometimes still gives him work, probably had him follow you.
C: BITSEY
D: Why?
N: A beat. David looks up at the microphone.
C: DAVID
D: To make sure you honored your agreement, one for which there's no contract.
C: BITSEY
D: He would've said something.
C: DAVID
D: He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom.
C: BITSEY
D: Maybe Dusty was jealous because you were seeing Constance.
C: DAVID
D: I wasn't 'seeing' Constance.
C: BITSEY
D: She died... she had your sperm --
C: DAVID
D: It's more complicated than that.
N: TWO SHOT Rotates.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WHITE.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ALLEY - MED. SHOT - DAVID - SUNRISE (ROTATING CAMERA)
N: David sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo. The tailgate's down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and whiskey bottle. David stares off down the alley, clearly in pain. He holds a child's drawing. INSERT - DRAWING Has Gaudi's church and a matador in background. Prominent in the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon ("Mommy"), Chase ("Me") and a dark-haired man ("Papa Jorge"). Jorge is dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown.
S: INT. DEATHWATCH AUSTIN OFFICE - SUNRISE (6:09)
N: The atmosphere is tense. Dusty Wright sits on a deskholding a red Magic Marker, the matron sits behind it. They look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer screen. In the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman, she murmurs quiet affirmations. Finally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods. The room's occupants all exchange glances. Dusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office.
S: INT. BACK OFFICE - SUNRISE
N: Constance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon. She's shockingly anemic. Dusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep. After a beat, she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been fighting to stay awake. She looks at him, then sees the marker in his hand. She looks away.
C: CONSTANCE
D: All I can feel is envy.
N: Dusty stands, goes to the alley window. DUSTY'S POV David's Volvo is parked just outside the window. David sits in a lawn chair behind it. David looks awful.
S: EXT. ALLEY - SUNRISE
N: In the window, Dusty holds up the marker. David nods.
S: EXT. HOUSE 3307 - CONSTANCE'S BACK YARD - DUSK
N: David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing. Constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. She goes to the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. They silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle, he sips his drink.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Remember those Kubler-Ross stages, the ones the dying go through?
C: DAVID
D: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Where are you?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Denial.
C: DAVID
D: Denial's my personal favorite.
C: CONSTANCE
D: The whole idea of there being a process makes me tired. I'm not up to the job of Dying Person. Marveling at blades of grass. Lecturing strangers to relish every moment.
C: DAVID
D: Mending bridges.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Mending bridges. Confessing regrets. Uuuggh.
C: DAVID
D: No regrets?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Nope.
N: A beat.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Take that back. I wish I had a child.
C: DAVID
D: Me, too.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I'm sorry, David.
N: She reaches over and puts her hand on his arm.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I guess I just wish I would have risked more.
N: She has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a swig.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Uumm, also not enough sex. Should have had more sex.
E: making a face, swallowing hard
N: She puts the bottle down beside her chair.
C: DAVID
D: How much... how many lovers have you had?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Including college?
C: DAVID
D: Including college.
N: Her hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers.
C: DAVID
D: Well, it's... not every... yeah, you should have had more sex.
N: She laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off into the yard. He takes her hand in his.
C: CONSTANCE
D: You work hard not to be seen as a sex object. Before long, you're not seen at all.
C: DAVID
D: I see you.
N: They are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs' armrests.
C: DAVID
D: Want to make it five? Finish the hand?
C: CONSTANCE
D: A pity lay. No thanks.
N: A beat. They watch their fingers lightly play with one another.
C: DAVID
D: It wouldn't be pity.
N: They turn, their eyes meet, hold.
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Constance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one hand supports her head, the other strokes her face. They tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently.
C: DAVID
D: Are you okay?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Don't worry.
N: He kisses her neck.
C: CONSTANCE
D: It's good.
N: Moves up to her ear.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Talk to me. Let me hear your voice.
C: DAVID
D: I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy.
E: in her ear
N: He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm. Her moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless whispers, meld into one another.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Hold me tight.
C: DAVID
D: I'm here.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Tight... I'm scared.
C: DAVID
D: It's okay.
N: She's begun to cry.
C: DAVID
D: Okay.
N: He stops moving, kisses her tears.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay in me.
N: He moves again, slowly.
C: DAVID
D: Shhh. I'm staying.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I need to feel you inside.
C: DAVID
D: It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling out.
C: CONSTANCE
D: I'm so tired.
C: DAVID
D: I know, I know.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Tired of being afraid.
C: DAVID
D: Shhh.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Help me.
C: DAVID
D: I'm here. It's okay.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Help me. Please. Make it stop.
C: DAVID
D: Shhh. I'm here. I'm here.
S: EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NIGHT
N: The house is dark. A light in one of the rooms comes on.
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: She's awake as David enters. He opens the curtains, sets a glass of water beside bottles on the nightstand. He crawls on top of the covers, spoons her, nuzzles the back of her head.
C: CONSTANCE
D: How do you feel about last night?
C: DAVID
D: Rescued. You?
C: CONSTANCE
D: Like I have a reason to get out of bed. Ironic, huh?
S: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - DAY
N: David goes to the pay phone against the building.
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower. Turns the water on. She's caught in a thought, bites her lip. She turns the water off.
S: EXT. APARTMENT POOL AREA - DAY
N: David sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right. He's sober.
C: DAVID
D: Let's say they move back from Spain, that I somehow got my one weekend a month. Would it matter? By high school, I'd be his weak spot, the focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed pride. In college there'd be late- night angst: 'What if I turn out like the old man?' Holidays would be forced smiles and unscheduled exits. I mean, what girl comes home with you if there's talk that Pops is a rapist?
N: A beat.
C: DAVID
D: I can't stand the idea of being his model of failure. Without him, I drink. To cover the hole. To prove to myself he's better off without me.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Dusty Wright sitting in the lounger beside him.
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S KITCHEN - DAY
N: Constance, still in her robe, puts an armful of sheets in the washing machine. She feels faint.
S: EXT. FORMER GALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
N: David sits in a swing set, rocks slowly. He's simply looking at the house. A yuppie woman opens the back door.
C: DAVID
D: Sorry, just leaving.
E: standing
S: INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Constance is quickly sorting through a box of memorabilia, a photo catches her attention. INSERT - PHOTO Constance on vacation in a Caribbean resort. She sits alone at a dinner table, looks to camera, seems surprised to be photographed. BACK ON SCENE As Constance contemplates the photo, she hears the DOORBELL ring.
S: EXT. LAWN - FROM ABOVE - DAY
N: We see David lying in the grass of recently-cut lawn.
S: INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - DUSK
N: David in the car in a mall parking lot, staring at nothing. On the seat beside him is Cloud Dog and a half empty Black Bush bottle.
S: INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - NIGHT
N: David's asleep, using Cloud Dog as a pillow. The bottle is empty. A light flashes in on him, waking him. There's a KNOCK on the window -- it's the police. He's blinded by the flashlight. POLICEMAN ROTATING CAMERA. The policeman holds the light.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Gale, time's up.
E: V.O. a loudspeaker voice
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WHITE.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - BITSEY AND DAVID - DAY
N: ROTATING CAMERA. Bitsey's agitated. David's drained.
C: BITSEY
D: But there has to be someone. Someone with a motive, who knew you both. Someone who visited that morning.
C: DAVID
D: If I could answer... we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's why I need you, why I chose you. You have my story, now... 'Go.'
E: mimicking her delivery
C: BITSEY
D: There's not enough time.
N: The guard approaches.
C: DAVID
D: You'll find time.
C: BITSEY
D: You know that's not what I meant. You should have done this earlier.
C: DAVID
D: You're not here to save me. You're here to save my son's memory of his father -- that's all I want.
N: A beat.
C: BITSEY
D: You're going to let them kill you.
N: David moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.
C: DAVID
D: We live to stop death. Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb. All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors.' But what do we really know about it? Nobody comes back. There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses... You wonder, maybe death is a gift. All I know is that by this time tomorrow, I'll be better off. What I don't know is why. Goodbye, Bitsey.
E: exits the cage
N: The guard escorts him away. When he's out of earshot:
C: BITSEY
D: Goodbye, David.
E: softly
S: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY
N: A guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door.
C: GUARD
D: Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here?
N: Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters flank the drive.
C: BITSEY
D: No thanks.
N: She turns and walks toward the highway. The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers. The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists: They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey. The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs: "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours." At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain; its letters run.
S: INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s) eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simple: You Kill, You Get Killed." In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS at a table not far from theirs. JOURNALIST #1 I got it. I got it. You could have corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The David Gale Execution, brought to you by...' JOURNALIST #2 '...Hefty.' They find this hilarious. Bitsey looks away.
C: BITSEY
D: What time is it?
C: ZACK
D: Nine hours, 52 minutes.
E: checking his watch
N: A beat.
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Pouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms, they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own.
C: BITSEY
D: Belyeu!
N: He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over her head, Zack slouches.
C: BITSEY
D: Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?
C: BELYEU
D: I employ Mr. Wright from time to time.
C: BITSEY
D: You could have said something.
C: BELYEU
D: That would have defeated the purpose. Apologies if I caused you unnecessary anxiety, but I'm paid to be suspicious. Thought I'd return this.
E: opening her umbrella handing it to her
C: ZACK
D: Any word on the writ?
C: BELYEU
D: Denied. Tape went to a federal judge two hours ago. Your videographer friend made contact?
C: BITSEY
D: No.
C: BELYEU
D: What you got was definitely a snippet. Could be he has more previews scheduled. Best stick close to your room.
C: BITSEY
D: How's David?
C: BELYEU
D: Holdin' up. I'm headed back over.
C: BITSEY
D: Tell him I'll take care of it, about his son, I mean.
C: BELYEU
D: Will do. We'll talk later?
N: She nods.
C: BELYEU
D: Watch yourselves.
N: They turn from one another. Bitsey turns back.
C: BITSEY
D: Mr. Belyeu.
E: calling after him
N: He turns.
C: BITSEY
D: Were Dusty and Constance close?
C: BELYEU
D: Thick as thieves.
N: Bitsey nods.
S: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT
N: Dark. Bitsey and Zack sit on either side of the room's table looking out the window. Rain shadows run down their faces. The room phone is on the table, as is Zack's watch: 10:17.
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX AND KETTLE - LONG SHOT - FROM ACROSS
N: INTERSTATE - NIGHT The rain's lightened up. The motel's full. Lights are on in ten of the motel rooms. The Kettle's lights go off, one after another.
S: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT
N: Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. Bitsey, lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her perfectly arranged suitcase. She stops, thinks. She goes to her purse and takes out the VHS cassette, a pen and a note pad. Hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the VCR. She turns on the TV and waits for an image.
S: EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT
N: Rain. All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark. From within comes a TV glow.
S: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - INSERT - BITSEY'S
N: NOTEPAD - NIGHT She's sketched a flow-chart of the tape with major elements timed out. BITSEY has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a bed. She's still watching the tape, tired, exasperated. Finally, she turns the TV OFF, rubs her eyes. She stands, looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33.
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on the floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack, stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hits her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She spits, hurries into the bedroom.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
C: BITSEY
D: Zack! Wake up! Get up!
E: putting on her shoes
N: He starts to pull himself awake.
C: BITSEY
D: Did you throw the towel on the floor?
C: ZACK
D: What?
C: BITSEY
D: The towel on my bathroom floor. Did you put it there?
C: ZACK
D: Yeah, I guess. It's a hotel room. What --
C: BITSEY
D: Do you do that at home?
C: ZACK
D: No. Fuck, Bitsey. I'm sorry, it's not like it's --
C: BITSEY
D: Get up.
N: She disconnects the VCR.
C: ZACK
D: What the fuck's wrong with you?
E: sitting up
C: BITSEY
D: Grab the T.V. I want to check something.
C: ZACK
D: What?
C: BITSEY
D: We're taking a tour.
C: ZACK
D: Where?
N: She has the VCR. Grabs her purse on the way to the door.
C: BITSEY
D: Austin. Get the T.V.
N: She opens the door, exits.
S: INT. HOUSE 3307 ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
N: The DOORBELL RINGS over BAUHAUS MUSIC. The Goth Girl, wearing only the Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, opens the door. Bitsey barrages past carrying the VCR, Zack follows with the TV.
C: BITSEY
D: Wanna make a hundred bucks?
C: GOTH GIRL
D: What do I gotta do?
S: INT. HOUSE 3307 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bitsey, Zack and the Goth girl enter.
C: BITSEY
D: We're going over the crime scene.
N: Bitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other exhibit pieces haven't changed.
C: BITSEY
D: And for the next hour I want you to do exactly what I say when I say to do it. If I say suck Zack's dick, all I want to hear from you is 'May I swallow.'
C: GOTH GIRL
D: You want me to suck his dick?
C: ZACK
D: It's just a patriarchal figure of speech.
C: BITSEY
D: Is your boyfriend here?
C: GOTH GIRL
D: He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore.
C: BITSEY
D: Well is his video camera here?
C: GOTH GIRL
D: Yeah.
C: BITSEY
D: Get it.
N: She starts to leave, turns back.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: I gotta collect first.
N: Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse. CLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK reads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC DOWN. SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or- less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.
C: ZACK
D: Move those index cards, too.
E: O.S.
N: She picks up the index cards. Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by- side.
C: BITSEY
D: Zoom in a hair.
N: He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).
C: BITSEY
D: Put the gloves on a dish rack.
C: GOTH GIRL
D: I don't have one.
N: Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over them.
C: BITSEY
D: Turn them inside out.
N: He does so.
C: BITSEY
D: Move the tape roll about a foot to the left. And get rid of the handcuffs.
N: Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the handcuffs.
C: BITSEY
D: Come check this, Zack. Could you... what's your name?
E: to the Goth Girl
C: GOTH GIRL
D: Nico's cool.
C: BITSEY
D: Nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter.
N: Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt.
C: ZACK
D: We can imagine that part. I'll position her.
E: to Bitsey
N: He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the floor).
C: BITSEY
D: That's fine. Just straighten her legs.
N: Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at the two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape, however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.
C: BITSEY
D: What's this?
C: ZACK
D: Towel or something.
C: BITSEY
D: Okay, look at this.
N: She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds.
C: BITSEY
D: I noticed this back at the hotel. See?
N: Bitsey touches the TV screen by one of Constance's feet. The foot moves ever so slightly. She hits pause.
C: BITSEY
D: She moves her foot. Why?
C: ZACK
D: Fucking good question.
C: BITSEY
D: It's another fifteen seconds before she comes to. If she had passed out once, without fresh air she wouldn't come back. There was no head trauma, her blood tested normal --
C: ZACK
D: Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping he would go away.
C: BITSEY
D: Or...
N: Bitsey looks up at Nico.
C: BITSEY
D: We've got to bag her.
C: ZACK
D: Woa. Not a good idea.
C: BITSEY
D: All right, I'll do it.
N: SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER Nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen. Bitsey and Zack stand by the sink. A white plastic bag is now on the sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape.
C: NICO
D: I found it.
N: Nico hands Zack the key to the handcuffs. He tests them, then lays them on the counter.
C: BITSEY
D: Okay, I want you to wait three minutes before you take it off.
E: to Zack
C: ZACK
D: Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this.
C: BITSEY
D: Three full minutes. Just stand behind the tripod. Both of you.
N: Zack and Nico move behind the tripod. Bitsey puts the bag on her head, rips off a long length of tape. She seals the bag around her neck. She then handcuffs herself from behind, with some difficulty. CLOSEUP - KEY is on the sink counter while she does this.
C: BITSEY
D: Have you started?
E: O.S. through the bag
N: BACK TO SCENE
C: ZACK
D: Twenty-two seconds.
N: Bitsey sits on the linoleum, then lies on her side.
C: ZACK
D: Thirty seconds.
C: NICO
D: Fuckin' wicked.
N: Bitsey lies perfectly still.
C: ZACK
D: Thirty-five... Forty... Forty-five... Fifty.
C: NICO
D: Maybe she shouldn't...
C: ZACK
D: Fifty-five... one minute... five... ten... one-fifteen...
N: Bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs.
C: ZACK
D: Fuck. Twenty... twenty-five... thirty...
C: NICO
D: This isn't cool.
C: ZACK
D: ...thirty-five... Fuck... one-forty... one-forty fi...
N: Bitsey panics, fights like hell against the cuffs.
C: BITSEY
D: Zack!
E: through the bag
N: Zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. He rips the bag open. She sucks air.
C: ZACK
D: Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You okay? What if I'd've waited?
E: ripping at the tape
N: She tries to catch her breath. Nico releases the handcuffs.
C: ZACK
D: No more fucking experiments, all right? Just tell me what's going on. You okay?
N: Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something. She takes his arm, looks at him.
C: BITSEY
D: She... she did it herself.
E: still breathing heavily
N: SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking. Nico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline, paces in front of them, thinking out loud.
C: BITSEY
D: She used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag. Then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit. A murderer would have just tossed them aside -- like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel.
C: ZACK
D: Maybe, all right, maybe. But why wear these?
E: indicating the cuffs
C: BITSEY
D: They threw me. I forgot you have to have the key to put them on. But she needed them. She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in.
C: NICO
D: Fuckin' A, like when people hang themselves. At the last second they go chicken, claw at the rope and shit. The police find their own skin beneath their nails.
C: BITSEY
D: And she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it. She made sure there was no way out.
C: ZACK
D: Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang yourself, or take pills. Why take your fucking clothes off? Why make it look like a murder?
N: A beat. Bitsey contemplates.
C: BITSEY
D: It's so calculated. She's handcuffed, taped at the mouth. The gloves. The damn tripod.
C: ZACK
D: Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder?
C: BITSEY
D: I don't know.
C: ZACK
D: Motive's like a major issue here.
C: BITSEY
D: Thanks, Zack.
C: ZACK
D: It doesn't make sense. The woman's a bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why frame an innocent man? Why send Gale to the chair for what looks --
C: BITSEY
D: What'd you say?
C: ZACK
D: She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall.
C: BITSEY
D: Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's why! To prove it happens. To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents.
C: ZACK
D: Get the fuck out of here.
C: BITSEY
D: No, that's how she thought. She lived for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die, why not die for it? That's why the tripod was here. To record proof, undeniable proof, the tape. That's why we got an out-take.
C: ZACK
D: A dead woman put the tape in your room?
C: BITSEY
D: Of course not. She needed help, someone to keep it, release it. Someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause...
N: They stare at each other a beat. The same thought:
C: ZACK
D: Thick as thieves.
E: mimicking Belyeu
S: INT. DUSTY WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
N: Dusty looks up at a wall clock: 4:23. He sits fully dressed in his living room, listening to an OPERA. He closes his eyes. CAMERA PULLS BACK OUT of his window and into:
S: EXT. WOODS BESIDE WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
N: Behind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and Zack hide watching him.
C: ZACK
D: Hairy.
C: BITSEY
D: Come on.
N: She turns back into the woods.
S: EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
N: Bitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car. They walk and speak quickly in the light rain.
C: BITSEY
D: ...Because of the Berlin thing, Constance knew the police would go straight to Gale. In a way, he's perfect. A high profile alcoholic whose life was shit anyway. But...
C: ZACK
D: She was in love with him.
C: BITSEY
D: I don't know. Something. They were close. She wouldn't want him dead.
N: They come to the car, get in.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
N: Bitsey drives.
C: BITSEY
D: Remember this thing about Dusty being a bull-horner, going to far?
C: ZACK
D: Why he was fired from DeathWatch, and the A.C.L.U.
C: BITSEY
D: Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction, after a year or so. You know, force him to dry out, let him play the heroic victim, give him back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's sitting on this tape, waiting, the only one who knows about it. And maybe good ole Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save.
C: ZACK
D: Which would only prove the system works.
C: BITSEY
D: Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count. What's one murder to stop thousands?
C: ZACK
D: So he'll wait, release the whole tape after the execution.
C: BITSEY
D: Right. Somewhere he must have the original. What time is it?
S: INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
N: The wall clock: 4:50. Dusty hears the PHONE RING over a BARITONE'S ARIA. He turns the MUSIC DOWN, and picks up.
C: DUSTY
D: Hello?
S: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
N: The gas station is old, isolated on a country road. Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates the area -- its light catching the drizzle. Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey waits by the rental car.
S: INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
N: Zack is on the phone with the booth door open. Bitsey stands just outside.
C: ZACK
D: Let's talk about your tape... No, meet me at the station down the hill, in fifteen minutes.
N: Zack hangs up before Dusty can respond. He stops out of the booth and gives Bitsey a tentative look.
S: INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
N: Dusty hangs up, thinks.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
N: Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat. Zack stands by the booth.
C: BITSEY
D: Don't move from the booth. Call the second you see the truck. Remember, let it ring just once. Then get into the woods --
C: ZACK
D: I know. Go.
C: BITSEY
D: Into the woods, Zack.
E: pulling away
C: ZACK
D: Go!
S: EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
N: Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup. She hurries to the front door, enters.
S: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
N: Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching. She sees 11 videos on a bookshelf. Some are labeled, three aren't. She takes the cassettes to the TV/VCR. Puts one in (her hands are wet). Nothing. She searches for the right AV channel.
S: INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
N: Zack anxiously waits. His eyes check the road.
S: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
N: Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old TV western. She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do so with each tape, hits eject. She checks the clock: 5:04. She takes another unlabeled tape. It's a home video of a city council meeting.
C: BITSEY
D: Shit!
E: hitting eject
N: She grabs the next unlabeled tape.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
N: Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch.
S: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
N: Bitsey has an old "I Love Lucy" episode. Ejects, looks at the label: "Lucy." She grabs another, labeled "Unforgiven." The credits from Unforgiven roll on screen.
C: BITSEY
D: Shit!
S: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
N: Zack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth, drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong to a car. He quickly hangs up.
S: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
N: Bitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson interview with Pavarotti.
C: BITSEY
D: Shit!
N: She reaches for another.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
N: Zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle.
C: ZACK
D: Come on. Fucking come on.
S: INT. WRIGHT CABIN
N: Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up on the screen. She hits eject. She gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something. She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it. After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer. It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to "Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New York 10036." A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label: "Constance." The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring again. A beat of absolute silence. Bitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water. ON VIDEO Constance turns from the sink:
C: CONSTANCE
D: Ready?
E: V.O. her voice weak
N: The response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She puts the glass in the sink. She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another small section, drops the roll on the floor. She tapes the small section over her mouth. She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. She seals the bag around her neck. She smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them. She sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her side, perfectly still, waiting. ON BITSEY Engrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat. VIDEO A man wearing gloves walks into the frame: Dusty. ON BITSEY This is what she's needed. VIDEO Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands. He picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat. We see only Constance's dead body -- then black. ON BITSEY A hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around. It's Zack, breathing hard.
C: ZACK
D: He didn't show! Fuckin' move!
N: Bitsey hits the eject button.
S: EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
N: Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods. The pickup is nowhere to be seen. As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching.
S: EXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE
N: The car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle has stopped.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
N: Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book. She's almost in tears, yelling.
C: BITSEY
D: Everyone! Wake up New York, the warden, the Governor, the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk! How far is it?
C: ZACK
D: Took me 30 this afternoon. You've got 26, maybe more.
C: BITSEY
D: I'll make it.
S: EXT. INTERSTATE - IN FRONT OF MOTEL SIX - SUNRISE
N: The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist.
S: EXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE
N: The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring stop signs.
S: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE
N: The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and disappears into the fog.
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE
N: The overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns on the RADIO. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONG is on. She punches scan.
C: BITSEY
D: Give me the time. Give me the goddamn time.
E: to the radio
S: EXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE
N: The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork reads: "TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles."
S: INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE
N: Bitsey smells something.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE
N: The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand. She doesn't close the door. Starts running. Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist. She runs, and runs. A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns, starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on. She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past a sleepy farmhouse. She runs, and runs. She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway. Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort. She runs. Sees something. Stops cold. Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. They rise on hill and then fall behind another. They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach. The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION. She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.
S: INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - SUNRISE

He RINGS the DOORBELL, turns and walks back down the hall. He stands at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to answer before descending. Sharon (older than we've seen her) opens the door, sees the case and sweatshirt. She looks around, but Dusty is gone. She picks them up.

C: MAIL GUY
D: This just came.
N: It's from "Belyeu & Crane/420 Congress Ave./Austin, Texas, 78710." She opens it, pulls out Cloud Dog and a handwritten note on Belyeu & Crane stationery. INSERT - NOTE reads: "David wanted you to have this. He said it would be the key to your freedom. Regards, Benjamin Belyeu."

N: Suddenly, she understands. She squeezes the sheep, shakes it, hears something. She cuts the sheep open with scissors. A Hi-8 tape is in the stuffing. It's hand labeled: "Off the record." She jumps up. TRACKING SHOT Bitsey hurries THROUGH the cubicles. She goes DOWN a hall and INTO the "MultiMedia" room.

N: David goes to Constance, kneels. He reaches down and with his thumb gently strokes her face through the plastic. He stands, turns and walks back to the camera. He reaches behind the lens to turn it off. A beat. Half his face fills frame, his watery eyes looking directly at us. In the other half, we see Constance's body. Black.
