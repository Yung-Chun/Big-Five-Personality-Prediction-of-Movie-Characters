D: Oh I must go
C: TUMNUS
D: It's too late for that now I'm such a bad faun
C: LUCY
D: No. You're the nicest faun I've ever met.
C: TUMNUS
D: Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor sampling.
C: LUCY
D: I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll never do it again.
C: TUMNUS
D: It's not something I have done, Lucy Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.
C: LUCY
D: What are you doing?
C: TUMNUS
D: I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch, the one that makes it always winter, and never Christmas. She told me that I If I ever was to come across a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed to turn it over to her!

C: MRS. MACREADY
D: You children are one shenanigan shy of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor! I told them you were not to be disturbed.
C: PROFESSOR
D: Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm sure there's a logical explanation. But I think this one needs some hot chocolate.
C: MRS. MACREADY
D: Yes Professor. Come on, dear.
N: Mrs. Macready takes Lucy down the hall. Peter and Susan turn to go

D: Like talking to a lunatic!
C: PROFESSOR
D: No, not her - the forest!
C: PETER
D: You're-you're not saying you believe her?
C: PROFESSOR
D: No, not her - the forest!
C: PETER
D: You....you actually believe her?
C: PROFESSOR
D: Well don't you?
C: SUSAN
D: Well, logically it couldn't possibly be there!
C: PROFESSOR
D: What do they teach at these schools?
C: PETER
D: Edmund said they were only pretending
C: PROFESSOR
D: And he's the more truthful one is he?
C: PETER
D: No, this would be the first time.
C: PROFESSOR
D: Well then, id your sister isn't lying and isn't mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth. She's your sister, isn't she? You're a family! It's high time you start acting like one!
N: CRICKET
C: PETER
D: Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!
N: Ball hits Edmund in the leg

C: SUSAN
D: Besides, we can all use the fresh air.
C: EDMUND
D: Not like there's air inside
C: PETER
D: Are you ready then?
C: EDMUND
D: Are you?
E: smacks his bat on the ground and gets ready to hit the ball
N: Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of armor. UPSTAIRS The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of armor on the floor
C: PETER
D: Well done, Ed!
C: EDMUND
D: You bowled it!
C: SUSAN
D: Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming
C: PETER

D: Get back!
N: SOUNDS OF KIDS GRIPING Susan and Peter fall backwards. IN NARNIA
C: SUSAN
D: Impossible!
C: LUCY
D: Don't worry, it's probably just your imagination
C: PETER
D: I don't suppose saying we're sorry would quite cover it?
C: LUCY
D: No, it wouldn't. But this might!
N: Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball, he throws one back at her and a snowball fight begins. Susan hits Ed in the arm with one
C: EDMUND
D: Ow! Stop it!
E: rubs his arm They all realize that Ed lied
C: PETER
D: You little liar!
C: EDMUND

D: Say you're sorry!
E: Peter steps up to him
C: EDMUND
D: Alright! I'm sorry.
C: LUCY

C: EDMUND
D: : Very funny.
E: mutters
C: SUSAN
D: Maybe we should go back
C: EDMUND

C: PETER
D: Well Mr. Tumnus it is
E: walks into the wardrobe again
C: SUSAN
D: We can't just walk around in these clothes!
C: PETER
D: We can use these coats.
E: comes out
C: SUSAN
D: Peter, they don't belong to us.
C: PETER
D: Well I don't think the professor will mind. And if you think about it logically we are not even taking them out of the wardrobe.
E: Hands coat to Edmund
C: EDMUND
D: But that's a girl's coat!

C: JADIS
D: You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.
N: Everyone gasps.
C: ASLAN
D: His offence was not against you.
C: WHITE WITCH
D: Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?
C: ASLAN
D: Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. I was there when it was made.
C: WHITE WITCH
D: Then you will know that the boy belongs to me. That boy will die on the Stone Table.
E: turns to crowd points to Edmund
C: PETER
D: Come and take it then.
C: WHITE WITCH
D: You think that a simple threat will deny me my right, little king? Aslan knows that if I do not have blood as the law demands, all of Narnia will be overturned, and perish, in fire and water.
C: ASLAN
D: Enough, I shall talk with you alone.
N: (time passes and the Witch exits tent)

C: SUSAN
D: Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with you?
C: ASLAN
D: I would be glad of the company tonight.
N: (Walk further)
C: ASLAN
D: It is time. From now on, I must go on alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. And farewell.
C: LUCY
D: Why doesn't he fight back?
E: later after lots of jeers towards Aslan as he walks to the Stone Table
C: WHITE WITCH
D: Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved.
N: More jeers and catcalls...
C: WHITE WITCH
D: Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!
C: WHITE WITCH
D: You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed in you. Did you really think that by giving your life you would save the Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your life, and saving no one. So much for love.
C: WHITE WITCH
D: In that knowledge... Despair... and DIE!!!!!!
N: She plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes slowly close
C: WHITE WITCH
D: The great cat is DEAD!!
N: Her army cheers loudly.
C: WHITE WITCH
D: General, gather your army and prepare for battle. However short it may be.
N: Otmin lets out a huge roar AFTER THE WHITE WITCH AND CREATURES ARE GONE The girls come up and cry and lean on Aslan. Lucy gets an idea, unscrews her potion
C: SUSAN
D: It's too late. He's gone. I'm sure he knew what he was doing.
N: We have to go.
C: LUCY
D: We can't just leave him here.
C: SUSAN
D: Lucy there's not time. We have to tell the others.
C: LUCY
D: The Trees
N: Back at Aslan's camp in the boys' tent
C: DRYAD
D: Fear not my princes. I come with tidings of grave news..
N: Peter walks out of the tent.
C: PETER
D: It is true, he's gone
C: EDMUND
D: Then you'll have to lead us. There's a whole army out there waiting to follow you.
C: PETER
D: I can't
C: EDMUND
D: Aslan believed you could. And so do I.
C: OREIUS
D: what are your orders?
N: Peter looks at map... you see the battle field BATTLE
C: GRYPHON
D: They come, you highness, in numbers and weapons far greater then our own.
C: OREIUS

C: LUCY
D: Susan!
C: SUSAN
D: What have they done?
N: Aslan appears, sending shivers down EVERYONE'S spine!
C: SUSAN AND LUCY
D: ASLAN!
N: Aslan laughs.
C: SUSAN
D: We saw the Witch, the knife.
C: ASLAN
D: If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice, she might have interpreted the Deep Magic a little differently. For she would know that if a willing victim who had committed no treachery died in a traitors stead, the Stone Table would crack and death itself would begin to unwind.
C: SUSAN
D: We sent the word that you were dead. Peter and Edmund would have gone to war.
C: LUCY
D: We have to help them.
E: draws knife
C: ASLAN
D: We will, but not alone. Now, climb on my back. We have a long ways to go and little time to get there. And you might want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!

He falls forward into Lucy and Susan's arm
C: LUCY
D: Susan this is...
C: SUSAN
D: MR TUMNUS!!!!
N: They hug....then they see Aslan
C: ASLAN
D: Come, lets search the castle - others may still be trapped inside and Peter will need all the help he can get.
N: BACK TO THE BATTLE
C: PETER
D: Ed! There are too many of them! Go! Get out of here! Get the girls, and get them home!
C: BEAVER
D: Come on, you heard him!
N: Ed starts to leave, then sees the Witch. And starts to go back
C: BEAVER
D: Peter said to go!
C: EDMUND
D: Peter's not King yet!
N: Edmund rushes down the hill and breaks the witch's sword, then she stabs him with the remainders of her wand. so the next thing that is actually said is a grunt issued from Edmund and...
C: PETER
D: Edmund!!
E: silenced
N: Peter and the Witch fight, then they see Aslan
C: WITCH
D: Impossible!
N: Aslan rushes to kill the Witch, everything disappears
