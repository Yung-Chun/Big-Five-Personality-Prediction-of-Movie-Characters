S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT
N: A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills. One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat suit stumbles.
C: DRUNK GIRL
D: Shit.
E: NICKI laughing
N: GIRL 1 (REBECCA) C'mon. Hurry up. They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the bottom of the chain link fence. She rolls under, and the others follow. A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house. They've done this before, they have it down. One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back window open. A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as she climbs inside into a laundry room. She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they slip inside. Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area. She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is totally cool and composed. She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye- brow.
C: REBECCA
D: Let's go shopping!
N: And she pulls open the closet door. CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags. A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a Louis Vuitton duffle bag. An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through. A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of prescription pills and dumps them in a bag. We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags. Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a mirror posing, then gets back to it.

N: The kids make their get-away: One girl, NICKI leans over and throws-up on their way out. They get into the Toyota and peel out. 2A MAIN TITLES - MONTAGE: 2A THE BLING RING CLOSE UP: flashbulbs go off. Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive teenagers and news clips. We see a clip of black & white video surveillance of the kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up. Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels. We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night. CLOSE UP: a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the hat we saw her try on earlier. Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags. T.V. image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for pictures. CLOSE UP: on a stack of shiny diamond necklaces. Revised Blue - 03/16/12 4. A Facebook page with party photo of one of the girls, Chloe in a slutty outfit, with tattooed thug, and the quote "Wanna smoke a bluuuunt". Pan across Calabassas McMansions.
S: 2B EXT. COURTHOUSE 2B

C: NICKI
D: I am a firm believer in Karma, and I think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being. I see myself being like an Angelina Jolie, but even stronger, pushing even harder for the universe and peace and for the health of the planet. I want to lead a huge * charity organization. I want to * lead a country for all I know. *

C: LAURIE
D: Let's have our morning prayer and then we'll meet in the living room at eight to start today's lesson on the laws of attraction, OK?
N: They join hands as Laurie enthusiastically leads them in her prayer.
C: LAURIE
D: My chief aim in life is to continually strive to express my greatest potential as a spiritual human being and contributor to the greater good for our planet and all those who live on it. I know that I have the ability to reach my aim in life, by persistent action and that the thoughts of my mind will reproduce themselves in outward physical reality. I will channel my energy towards my aim in life with graciousness and loving kindness to myself and others.

She looks through drawers, takes a make-up bag, and looks through the medicine cabinet. She finds a necklace on the counter - a gold chain, with an `R'. She puts it around her neck and clasps it as she looks at herself in the mirror. Nicki and Sam grab designer purses and clothes. A cat comes up to them.

N: Rebecca pulls up in her car and they get in and drive off.

C: NICKI
D: She had a dysfunctional background, we both did...

D: Nicki has expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism.
C: NICKI
D: It's my main goal. God didn't give me these talents and what I look like to sit around and just be a model or famous. I want to do something people notice, that's why I'm studying business, so I can be a leader and take a stand for people.

C: KATE
D: And now you're a star.
N: Marc laughs.
C: MARC
D: On my Facebook page recently I had 800 friends requests, I accepted them all, I didn't even look at them, then I noticed someone had created a fan page for me. If it had been for something I had done to help the community or benefit something I'd love it, but it's just kind of awkward for me that these people are loving me for something that's looked down on in society... It's kinda showing that America has some sick fascination with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.
