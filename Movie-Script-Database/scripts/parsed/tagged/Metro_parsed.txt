E: O.S.
C: ROPER
D: SHIT!
E: V.O.
N: The Trans Am streak off toward the city.
S: EXT. BANK - DOWNTOWN - DAY
N: A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars, ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out, weaves through the spectators and past the barriers. A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him.
C: KIMURA
D: Hi, Roper.
C: ROPER
D: Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
N: Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him...
C: KIMURA
D: The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
C: ROPER
D: ...a car.
C: KIMURA
D: That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
C: ROPER
D: ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
C: KIMURA
D: That's right.
C: ROPER
D: What's the suspect's name?
C: KIMURA
D: Earl.
S: INT. DINER - DAY
N: Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper saunters in.
C: ROPER
D: Hello, guys.
C: BAFFERT
D: Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
N: Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing.
C: ROPER
D: Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?
N: Baffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it.
C: BAFFERT
D: This guy is no genius.
N: Roper scans the profile.
C: ROPER
D: They're not usually graduate students.
C: BAFFERT
D: SWAT wants to go in.
C: ROPER
D: What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
N: Roper refers to the folder.
C: ROPER
D: We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
C: KIMURA
D: Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
C: ROPER
D: I have to go face to face.
C: BAFFERT
D: No -- you can't do that.
C: ROPER
D: You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
C: BAFFERT
D: I don't know.
C: ROPER
D: He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
C: BAFFERT
D: Not that we know of.
C: ROPER
D: We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
C: BAFFERT
D: Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
C: KIMURA
D: SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in the last situation rendered it inoperable.
C: BAFFERT
D: What do you mean?
C: KIMURA
D: He urinated on it and shorted out the circuits.
C: ROPER
D: We gonna stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to death. Give me a dozen donuts.
E: beat... beat
N: Roper pulls out his gun and places it on the counter.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Roper eats the donut as he crosses toward the bank.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET - DAY
N: A team of two SWAT TEAM MEMBERS, FORBES IS A SPOTTER AND MCCALL IS A SHARPSHOOTER. KEVIN MCCALL, is the one we're interested in. He's 25 years old, handsome, all American. He's the best the SWAT team has. He crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his rifle, watching as Roper calmly walks toward the bank.
C: FORBES
D: What do you think he's got in the bag?
C: MCCALL
D: Donuts.
C: FORBES
D: You can't take a guy down with a donut.
S: INT. BANK - DAY
N: A tense situation. A wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a BANK ROBBER, EARL, is holding a pretty, young TELLER around the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple. The other bank employees are cowering on the floor. A few are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious and oozing blood from his side. Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward Earl, very sociable.
C: ROPER
D: Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna donut? I ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a --
N: Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking Roper for weapons with his free hand. The other hand still has the gun poised at the young teller's head.
C: ROPER
D: I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry a weapon.
N: Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. It seems to help. Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up and puts his hand around the teller's neck.
C: EARL
D: Where's the car?
C: ROPER
D: I need to get something straight first.
N: Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the floor.
C: ROPER
D: Who's the manager?
N: A balding, middle-aged MAN sheepishly raises his hand.
C: MANAGER
D: I am.
N: Roper takes a step toward him.
C: ROPER
D: When did you start keeping longer hours?
C: MANAGER
D: Last spring.
C: ROPER
D: Really! Because I've been thinking of moving to this branch. It would be really convenient for me --
C: EARL
D: HEY, SHUT UP!
N: Earl wags his gun against the Teller's ear.
C: EARL
D: Do you want me to start killing people?!
N: Roper holds his hand up defensively.
C: ROPER
D: It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
C: EARL
D: Then where's my FUCKING car!
N: Earl is pouring sweat. His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.
C: ROPER
D: I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to do this the right way.
N: Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl. His voice is calm.
C: ROPER
D: First I need you to point that gun away from -- What's your name?
E: to the teller
C: TELLER
D: Debbie...
E: voice trembling
C: ROPER
D: Point the gun away from Debbie.
C: EARL
D: Debbie's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if I don't see a car in five minutes!
N: Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger.
C: ROPER
D: Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out.
N: Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation.
C: EARL
D: What are my chances of getting out of here?
N: Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.
C: ROPER
D: Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City...
N: Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard.
C: ROPER
D: How ya doin'?
N: The guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces.
C: ROPER
D: ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway.
E: to Earl
N: Earl is encouraged by that.
C: EARL
D: Really?
C: ROPER
D: Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
N: Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes.
C: ROPER
D: He didn't kill anybody, though.
N: Roper bends over the guard.
C: ROPER
D: This is gonna hurt.
N: He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously.
C: EARL
D: Hey, leave him alone. What are you doing?
N: Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.
C: ROPER
D: It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing.
N: Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. He lets Roper drag the guard to the door.
C: ROPER
D: I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie.
N: Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple.
S: EXT. BANK - DAY
N: Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of them is Jennings.
C: ROPER
D: Give me your gun.
E: whispering to Jennings
N: (NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband under his shirt and vest.
C: ROPER
D: I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years.
C: JENNINGS
D: Why not keep the streak alive?
C: ROPER
D: Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody.
S: INT. BANK - DAY
N: Earl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's back. He's getting very agitated.
C: EARL
D: HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE!
E: yelling
N: The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from Earl.
C: ROPER
D: As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith.
N: Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.
C: ROPER
D: Give me Debbie.
N: Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her head.
C: EARL
D: Take the old guy.
N: The other hostages watch this exchange tensely.
C: ROPER
D: The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
C: EARL
D: Am I gettin' the car?
C: ROPER
D: You're gettin' the car.
N: Earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at two of the female employees cowering against the counter.
C: EARL
D: Take them.
N: Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.
C: ROPER
D: You two, leave.
N: The two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump up and rush out the front door.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
N: McCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops.
C: FORBES
D: This guy is good.
C: MCCALL
D: That's what they say.
S: INT. BANK - DAY
C: ROPER
D: That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going to get your car.
N: Roper turns around and walks toward the front door. He stops and looks over his shoulder.
C: ROPER
D: Oh, there's one last thing.
N: Earl looks like he's right on the edge.
C: EARL
D: What?!
C: ROPER
D: You want a convertible or hardtop?
N: Earl thinks about that for a beat...
C: ROPER
D: Hardtop.
N: Roper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the bank.
C: ROPER
D: Manual or automatic?
E: without turning around
C: EARL
D: Automatic.
C: ROPER
D: You got it.
N: In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!... One SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie shrieks at the top of her lungs. SWAT guys pour in from every entrance. YELLING for everybody to "GET DOWN"! Pointing guns. They pounce on Earl.
C: EARL
D: I give up! I give up!
N: Roper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently leads her out of the bank.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
N: McCall and Forbes still have their rifles trained on the bank door. Their police radio squawks...
C: RADIO
D: The situation is secured. Suspect in custody. Repeat. Situation secured.
N: McCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the wave of cops rushing into the bank.
S: EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.
C: RONNIE
D: There's one for the front page.
N: Roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love... which he in fact is.
C: ROPER
D: Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I can't live without you.
N: Ronnie rolls her eyes. She doesn't take Roper all that seriously.
C: RONNIE
D: Don't start.
N: She slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk off. Roper dogs her.
C: ROPER
D: This baseball player you're going out with... He's no good for you.
E: shaking his head
C: RONNIE
D: Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
C: ROPER
D: I worship you.
C: RONNIE
D: You worship yourself.
C: ROPER
D: Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
C: RONNIE
D: Greg.
C: ROPER
D: Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
N: Ronnie stops. Looks him in the eye.
C: RONNIE
D: You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
C: ROPER
D: Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
N: Ronnie smiles, but offers no response.
C: ROPER
D: Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
C: ROPER
D: This Greg is really getting in my way.
E: frowning
N: Roper gets down on his knees.
C: ROPER
D: Please. I'm begging you.
C: RONNIE
D: Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
N: She takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK! Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He rushes over to his car.
C: ROPER
D: Hey, that's my car.
N: A REPO MAN stands off to the side watching dispassionately.
C: REPO MAN
D: Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver Hills Financial.
N: Roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved Trans Am.
S: INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY - RAINING
N: Lots of activity. Officers in cubicles; talking on phones; typing reports on computers. Most are plain-clothed. Roper weaves through the room. Passes by Baffert's desk.
C: ROPER
D: Hey, Baffert, what's the story for tonight?
N: Baffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his pocket.
C: BAFFERT
D: Floor seats.
C: ROPER
D: You're my hero.
C: BAFFERT
D: Dinner's on you.
C: ROPER
D: Deal.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING
N: A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. He goes into the Captain's office.
S: INT. CAPTAIN SOLIS' OFFICE - RAINING
N: CAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down.
C: SOLIS
D: He just walked into my office. The Chief says, "Good work this morning. Congratulations."
E: looks over at Roper
N: Roper smiles as he sits down.
C: ROPER
D: Tell him to give me a raise.
C: SOLIS
D: He says, "Thank you very much." I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
E: into the phone a beat
N: Solis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause. He knows he's got leverage.
C: SOLIS
D: Roper.
C: ROPER
D: What?
C: SOLIS
D: Are you going to make this hard for me?
C: ROPER
D: Depends. What's up?
C: SOLIS
D: There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
C: ROPER
D: Define concern.
N: Solis dumps his cards on the table.
C: SOLIS
D: What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
C: ROPER
D: Your concern is heartwarming.
C: SOLIS
D: It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
C: ROPER
D: Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
C: SOLIS
D: His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
N: Roper grabs McCall's folder off the desk.
C: ROPER
D: Let me see that.
N: Roper scans it.
C: ROPER
D: Tested high on his intellectual aptitude... Not as high as me but... National marksman finalist... Attended N. Y. C... Went to college. Very impressive. F.B.I. sniper school... Mayorial commendation.
S: INT. HALLWAY - SAME - RAINING
N: McCall turns around in his chair. He can see Roper and Solis through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear their voices.
S: INT. SOLIS' OFFICE - SAME - RAINING
C: ROPER
D: "Additional Skills": Biathelete, marathoner, lip-reading, speaks Spanish...
N: Roper throws the folder back on the desk.
C: ROPER
D: Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
C: SOLIS
D: You let us worry about that.
C: ROPER
D: Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
C: SOLIS
D: What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
E: gloomily
C: ROPER
D: The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
C: SOLIS
D: What do you think would be in order?
C: ROPER
D: Like ahh... I don't know... Five thousand dollars.
E: boldly
C: SOLIS
D: Okay, I think I could swing that.
E: calmly
N: Uh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short.
C: ROPER
D: And a car.
E: quickly
C: SOLIS
D: Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
C: ROPER
D: You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
C: SOLIS
D: Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
C: ROPER
D: The car is part of the deal.
E: firmly
C: SOLIS
D: What happened to your Trans Am?
N: Solis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come in.
C: ROPER
D: Repoed this morning.
C: SOLIS
D: I'll provide you with transportation.
E: relenting
C: ROPER
D: And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
N: McCall enters the office.
C: ROPER
D: Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard nothing but good things about you...
E: instant character change
N: Roper reaches out. They shake hands.
C: MCCALL
D: Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
C: ROPER
D: You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
C: MCCALL
D: I'm ready to do it. And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
E: a beat
N: Roper's face darkens.
C: ROPER
D: Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
C: MCCALL
D: Sorry... Habit.
C: SOLIS
D: Let's move past this, gentlemen.
E: intervening
N: Roper smiles.
C: ROPER
D: We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
C: MCCALL
D: If you say so.
C: SOLIS
D: Then you'll have to excuse me. I have other work to do.
N: Roper and McCall head out the door.
C: SOLIS
D: Roper...
N: Roper turns back around.
C: SOLIS
D: About the transportation issue... You check with the impound sergeant.
N: Roper smiles. Total victory.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING
N: MOVING with Roper and McCall.
C: ROPER
D: You ever been in a hostage situation?
C: MCCALL
D: Only at the very end.
C: ROPER
D: How do you feel after a shooting.
C: MCCALL
D: Like it had to be done.
E: self-assured
N: They enter the squadroom, wind through the cubicles.
C: ROPER
D: It rarely has to be done.
C: MCCALL
D: I've rarely shot anyone.
C: ROPER
D: SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
C: MCCALL
D: I know.
E: flatly
C: ROPER
D: Try to remember that.
N: They arrive at Roper's desk.
C: ROPER
D: Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one...
N: Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk. He takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the empty bottle. He places the bottle on his desk.
C: ROPER
D: Extract that pen cap without touching or moving the bottle.
N: McCall looks at the bottle quizzically.
C: MCCALL
D: What's the point of this?
C: ROPER
D: A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
N: Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder the problem. McCall looks over at another cop who has been observing. The cop shrugs his shoulders. He hasn't got a clue. McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Roper and Baffert walking past the row of cars, including Solis' cadillac, searching for Roper's "new" transportation... Roper is holding the keys in his hand.
C: BAFFERT
D: Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
C: ROPER
D: "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
C: BAFFERT
D: I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
C: ROPER
D: Yeah, okay.
N: Roper is looking at the numbered parking spaces.
C: BAFFERT
D: This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
C: ROPER
D: You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
C: BAFFERT
D: Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
C: ROPER
D: It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
C: BAFFERT
D: No shit! He's good!
E: impressed
C: ROPER
D: Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
C: BAFFERT
D: Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
N: Roper bends over like an old man.
C: ROPER
D: Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.
N: They arrive at their destination. A parking space with a 1957 DODGE PICKUP.
C: BAFFERT
D: This is it. Space 742.
N: Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief.
C: ROPER
D: Then he didn't say 742. He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right.
N: Baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who is crossing to the truck.
C: ROPER
D: Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not riding in this shit. I can't roll in no shit like this.
N: He takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the passengers side. He opens the door.
C: BAFFERT
D: Where's the stereo?
C: ROPER
D: Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
C: BAFFERT
D: Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
S: EXT. MARKET STREET - NIGHT
N: The pickup in traffic. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: EXT. KORDA'S BUILDING - NIGHT
N: It's a four story twenties style walk-up. It's evening now. The pickup pulls to a stop out front.
S: INT. PICKUP - NIGHT
N: Baffert pulls out a slip of paper.
C: BAFFERT
D: Apartment 306.
C: ROPER
D: You want me to go up with you?
C: BAFFERT
D: Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
C: ROPER
D: Good. I don't want to be late.
N: Baffert gets out. Roper grabs his cell phone.
C: ROPER
D: You want anything on the game?
N: Baffert turns back around.
C: BAFFERT
D: What's the line?
C: ROPER
D: It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
C: BAFFERT
D: I'll take half of your action.
N: Baffert goes into the building. Roper dials his cellular phone. Beep! Beep! DETAIL SHOT A message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY. Roper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He gets out of the truck and crosses to it.
S: INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Third floor hallway. Nice, middle class place. Well kept up. Baffert walks over to room 306. Knocks.
S: INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT
N: Jazz is playing. MICHAEL KORDA sits motionless in a chair listening to the music. There's a KNOCK. Korda responds as if pulled from a trance. He rises and moves to the door.
C: KORDA
D: Who is it?
C: BAFFERT
D: It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
E: V.O.
N: A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door.
C: KORDA
D: What happened? Is there a problem?
C: BAFFERT
D: May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
N: Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the music. A smile grows on his face.
C: BAFFERT
D: Count Basie?
N: Korda smiles back. Another jazz aficionada.
C: KORDA
D: Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30,
C: BAFFERT
D: Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
N: Korda goes to the stereo, turns it down. Duke Ellington plays low.
C: BAFFERT
D: Where did you find an old recording like that?
C: KORDA
D: Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson. Memories... Memory Lane or something...
E: searching for the name
C: BAFFERT
D: I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
C: KORDA
D: You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
N: Baffert smiles.
C: BAFFERT
D: No, this is a different Frank. This is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen jewelry usually. You wouldn't know anybody like that?
N: Korda drifts to the other side of the room. Takes a look out his front window... HIS POV Nobody there. Just the truck.
C: KORDA
D: I certainly wouldn't.
N: He says it as if the very idea disturbs him. He turns away from the window. Baffert feigns a coughing spell.
C: BAFFERT
D: Could I please have a little water?
C: KORDA
D: Of course.
E: the perfect host
N: Korda heads toward the kitchen area. Baffert uses this as an opportunity to drift around the room. Do a little snooping.
C: BAFFERT
D: The reason I'm asking you is because we arrested him with some stolen jewelry. It was traced to the robbery of a store down on Polk Street. He said he was fencing it for you.
N: Baffert notices something in the trash can. HIS POV Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels. They have jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade.
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Korda, pouring the water, notices Baffert's discovery, but his face betrays nothing.
C: KORDA
D: There's obviously some mistake. I have a cousin who has had run-ins with the law.
E: calmly
N: Korda re-enters the room with the glass of water.
C: KORDA
D: Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
C: BAFFERT
D: This cousin of yours... What's his name?
C: KORDA
D: Clarence Teal.
E: forthrightly
N: They look at each other a beat. Korda is still holding the water.
C: KORDA
D: Your cough seems to be better.
N: A real repressed tension here. Someone's about to get hurt. Baffert takes the glass of water.
C: BAFFERT
D: Thank you.
N: He takes a sip. Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts the glass down on the table.
C: BAFFERT
D: Well, I'm on my way to the game. I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Korda.
N: Korda smiles. Baffert walks to the door. Opens it to leave...
C: KORDA
D: Lieutenant...
N: Baffert turns back around.
C: KORDA
D: Do you believe that story about Robert Johnson...? That he made a deal with the devil at the crossroads?
N: Baffert muses along with Korda.
C: BAFFERT
D: Could be.
N: Baffert moves off down the hall and Korda closes his door.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Baffert gets into the elevator.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: Baffert takes out his cell phone. Dials.
C: BAFFERT
D: Hello, Judge Stone... This is Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a suspect's residence. I'm requesting a telephonic search warrant in connection with an armed robbery at a jewelry store. There's visible evidence on the premises. Glassine envelopes with jeweler's markings were seen in the trash can...
E: as the elevator descends
N: The elevator hits the first floor.
C: BAFFERT
D: ...I believe a full search of the premises will turn up some stolen property...
N: The elevator opens. Korda is standing there with a knife. Baffert has no time to react... The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and slashing across the throat.
S: EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street, returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her groceries enters the building. Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.
S: INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look good. The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes by her up the stairs.
C: ROPER
D: Get an ambulance!
E: to the woman
S: INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Roper arrives at the top of the stairs. Korda's door is ajar. Duke Ellington can be heard faintly.
S: INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT
N: Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a door. Roper races out.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it open. Gun aimed.
S: INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT
N: A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he leaves.
S: EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.
S: INT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN
N: Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone.
C: SOLIS
D: Yes sir. Every resource will be brought to bear. We will find this guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll tell him.
E: on the phone
N: Solis hangs up the phone.
C: SOLIS
D: The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
C: ROPER
D: He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said... I want to be put on this case.
E: still looking out window beat; turning to Solis
C: SOLIS
D: I can't do that.
C: ROPER
D: I want to be put on this case.
E: emphatic
C: SOLIS
D: You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
C: ROPER
D: Who's running it?
C: SOLIS
D: Roper...
C: ROPER
D: Who's running it!
C: SOLIS
D: Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
N: Roper turns to leave.
C: SOLIS
D: Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.
N: Roper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT
N: Two detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming.
C: ROPER
D: Hey, hey, hey...
N: Roper intercepts them.
C: ROPER
D: Anything on Korda so far?
C: KIMURA
D: Solis said to keep you clear of this.
N: Roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward Solis' hallway.
C: ROPER
D: I don't give a damn what Solis said. If you get a lead, I want to know.
E: to the detectives
N: Sequence omitted from original script.
S: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT - RAINING
N: Roper's pickup drives by.
S: INT. PICKUP
N: Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost.
S: INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard.
C: RONNIE
D: Just a minute.
E: O.S.
N: Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and earrings.
C: RONNIE
D: Hey.
C: ROPER
D: Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
C: RONNIE
D: A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels?
E: like hell smells his breath
C: ROPER
D: I'm not drunk. Yet.
C: RONNIE
D: Maybe you should be.
C: ROPER
D: You heard.
N: She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah. I'm sorry.
C: ROPER
D: Can I come in?
N: Ronnie opens the door reluctantly.
S: INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Roper enters. Instantly we see he's at home here. He hangs his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices a photograph on the wall. Quite imposing. Very unique style.
C: ROPER
D: That a new picture?
C: RONNIE
D: About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
N: Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch and his head in Roper's lap.
C: ROPER
D: Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy? He heard my voice.
E: to Ronnie
N: Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his presence. His words are light. His tone isn't.
C: ROPER
D: How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. You miss me?
N: Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's carefully buried.
C: ROPER
D: He misses me.
N: She nods. A moment's silence.
C: ROPER
D: I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
C: RONNIE
D: You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
E: a bit surprised at his openness
C: ROPER
D: It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
C: RONNIE
D: Scott, You can't save everyone.
C: ROPER
D: I've proved that, didn't I?
N: She's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it. She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises.
C: ROPER
D: Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
C: RONNIE
D: What do you want from me?
E: gentle
C: ROPER
D: Something I guess I can't have anymore.
C: RONNIE
D: Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
C: ROPER
D: You think I didn't need you?
E: surprised, hurt
C: RONNIE
D: If you did, you never showed it.
C: ROPER
D: Ronnie...
N: He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie pulls back, confused and guilty.
C: ROPER
D: You expecting someone?
N: Her silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper.
C: ROPER
D: This day just keeps getting better.
N: Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets.
C: RONNIE
D: They're on the table where you always leave them.
E: soft
N: He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his face.
C: GREG
D: Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...
N: Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper.
C: ROPER
D: I was just leaving.
N: Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him to follow Roper. She calls after him.
C: RONNIE
D: Scottie... take care of yourself.
N: Roper doesn't look back. He just goes.
S: EXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING
N: A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME
N: Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are connected to the end of the warehouse.
S: INT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME
N: Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.
C: KORDA
D: If you weren't family I'd kill you.
N: Clarence is scared. He offers no defense.
C: KORDA
D: You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
C: CLARENCE
D: So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
N: Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot.
C: KORDA
D: You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
C: CLARENCE
D: I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
C: KORDA
D: Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
C: CLARENCE
D: What happened, Mike.
C: KORDA
D: You don't want to know.
N: Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes.
C: CLARENCE
D: I'm sorry, Mike.
N: Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.
C: KORDA
D: God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
C: CLARENCE
D: I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
C: KORDA
D: Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!... They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
E: a beat
N: Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add up in his head.
C: CLARENCE
D: Did you kill him, Mike?
N: Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper again.
C: CLARENCE
D: I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...
N: We're talking major fear here... Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against his chest.
C: KORDA
D: It's not your fault you're stupid.
N: Tears of relief from Clarence.
S: INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY
N: Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling. A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in Hostage Situations". On the desk in front of him is the bottle with the pen cap still in it.
C: ROPER
D: What do you got on Korda?
E: to Kimura and Glass
C: KIMURA
D: We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
C: ROPER
D: Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
E: rapid fire
C: KIMURA
D: Being faxed over now.
C: ROPER
D: How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
C: KIMURA
D: Roper...
C: ROPER
D: And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
C: KIMURA
D: Roper, we're into it...
N: Suddenly Solis appears at their side.
C: SOLIS
D: We've had this conversation once, Roper. You're not active on this case.
N: Roper looks at him icily.
C: SOLIS
D: It's in everyone's best interest.
N: McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely. After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis heads back to this office.
C: ROPER
D: You guys are doing good work.
E: softened
N: He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him coming.
C: MCCALL
D: I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
C: ROPER
D: I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
N: McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda bottle.
C: ROPER
D: I don't see much progress here.
N: McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water. He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle. CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without touching or moving the bottle.
C: ROPER
D: Very nice... You get an "A". Notice... No force required. No damage.
N: Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom.
C: SERGEANT
D: Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 6th Street. Possible hostage situation.
N: McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk, then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the trash can. He and McCall head out.
S: EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY
N: The pickup is weaving through traffic.
S: INT. PICKUP - DAY
N: Start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging from the rear view mirror. PULL BACK to show a police bubble flashing on the dashboard. Roper weaving through traffic. McCall is sitting calmly as ever.
C: ROPER
D: So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
C: MCCALL
D: They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
C: ROPER
D: Recruited you from where?
C: MCCALL
D: National Marksman Competition.
C: ROPER
D: With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
C: MCCALL
D: Furthest point I could find from New York.
C: ROPER
D: You don't like New York?
C: MCCALL
D: Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
C: ROPER
D: You'd never been out of New York?
C: MCCALL
D: Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
C: ROPER
D: How did you like Toronto?
C: MCCALL
D: It was okay.
C: ROPER
D: You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
C: MCCALL
D: You caught me on an "up" day. How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
E: a beat
C: ROPER
D: I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was. So you're looking for "fast advancement".
E: a beat
C: MCCALL
D: Is there something wrong with that?
C: ROPER
D: I'm not sure.
S: EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
N: Several Patrol Cars are parked in front of an unappealing apartment building. A crowd has begun to gather. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN hold them back. TWO COPS are questioning a man wearing only green slacks. No shirt. No shoes. Just the slacks. He is very agitated. The pickup screeches up. Roper and McCall hop out. Roper flashes his badge to the OFFICER in charge. (OFFICER #1)
C: ROPER
D: Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
N: OFFICER #1 Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
C: ROPER
D: Which apartment?
N: The Officer points up to the third floor. OFFICER #1 That one with the bars on the windows. Roper nods. Walks back over to the pickup. Looks up. Eyeballs the building.
C: ROPER
D: How are we gonna get him out of there?
C: MCCALL
D: We could fill it with water.
N: Roper throws him a look. McCall walks to the back of the pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel bag.
C: ROPER
D: Have you evacuated anyone?
E: to Officer #1
N: OFFICER #1 Only that floor.
C: ROPER
D: Is the hostage injured?
N: OFFICER #1 Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
C: ROPER
D: Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
N: McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand.
C: MCCALL
D: I'll take "highground" until SWAT gets here. I can get a good sight-line from that roof across the street.
E: surveying the area
N: McCall marches off across the street.
C: ROPER
D: Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying to limit the force here.
N: McCall calls back over his shoulder.
C: MCCALL
D: I know my job.
N: At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor window. Roper heads for the front door of the building.
S: INT. APT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - (ACROSS THE STREET)
N: McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop.
S: INT. 6TH ST. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
N: The screams are getting more panicky. Roper comes down the hall quickly. The door to the apartment is open. It's been that way since the guy in the green slacks fled. Roper hurries toward the door.
S: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
N: The WIFE is in bra and panties and the HUSBAND is 6'4". He's giving her a good beating. It's a studio apartment. Unmade bed. Belongings strewn all over. Window open with sun streaming in, and a good view of the building across the street. We hear ROPER'S VOICE from out in the hall.
C: ROPER
D: I'm coming in. I'm not armed.
E: V.O.
N: The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife to her throat.
C: WIFE
D: No, Raymond!
E: shrieking
C: RAYMOND
D: Stay the fuck out of here!
E: to Roper
N: But Roper steps into the apartment. Sees the wife. Face swollen. Knife to her neck. The enraged husband, contemplating murder. One inch from committing the act. Roper doesn't bat an eye.
C: ROPER
D: I know how you feel, Ray.
C: RAYMOND
D: You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
N: He presses the knife against the wife's throat. She winces. Her chest heaves.
C: ROPER
D: I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
C: RAYMOND
D: You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
C: ROPER
D: Let me show you something, Ray.
N: Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. He extracts a photo. CLOSEUP PHOTO Wife. Two kids. A little dog-eared. Nice touch. ROPER holds it up so Raymond can see it.
C: ROPER
D: Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
C: RAYMOND
D: I ain't interested in your life story.
C: ROPER
D: Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
C: RAYMOND
D: She's the one to blame. Not me.
S: EXT. ROOF ACROSS THE STREET - ON MCCALL
N: In prone position. Rifle in hand. Eye to scope. POV THROUGH SIGHT of Raymond's open window.
S: INT. RAYMOND'S APARTMENT
N: Everyone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter sincerity.
C: ROPER
D: Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
C: RAYMOND
D: What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
N: And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not that coherent.
C: RAYMOND
D: I'm down at Consolidated and I'm begging. I'm saying I'll take half my pay. Eight years, man. I don't even have to work the loading docks anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're cutting back. We're streamlining, Ray. West Central's running things now. It's out of our hands" Fuck them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM! I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna live anymore.
E: deep sigh
N: Roper reaches out to him.
C: ROPER
D: Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
C: RAYMOND
D: Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
C: ROPER
D: I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
C: RAYMOND
D: And why the fuck would you do that for me?
C: ROPER
D: Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
C: RAYMOND
D: Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
C: ROPER
D: My name's Scott Roper.
N: Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... Then...
C: RAYMOND
D: I need my coat.
N: It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns and goes to get his coat. He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. The wife runs out of the room, screaming!
C: ROPER
D: NOOOO!!
N: He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds down the stairs... down another flight...
S: EXT. APT. BLDG.
N: McCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his path.
C: ROPER
D: WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
N: McCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues into the building.
S: INT. APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Roper follows, screaming his head off.
C: ROPER
D: Do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle, it makes you God! What the fuck goes on in your head?
N: McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow "crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under the tape. Roper follows.
S: INT. APT. - DAY
N: McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms. Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special" variety. McCall looks up at Roper.
C: MCCALL
D: SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? I just saved a life. Yours.
N: Roper doesn't miss a beat.
C: ROPER
D: You think I've never had a gun pulled on me?! You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it?!
E: still angry
N: McCall gets to his feet.
C: MCCALL
D: Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
C: ROPER
D: Not the ones I'm at.
E: fiercely
N: McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat. McCall's face softens just perceptibly.
C: MCCALL
D: Sorry. My mistake.
N: He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses the sheet over Ray's dead body.
S: INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT
N: Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked "Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the floor. Waiting. The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on the back.
C: INVESTIGATOR
D: Looks like a clean shoot. Go home and get some rest.
N: McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled off considerably. Even a tad friendly.
C: ROPER
D: Come on. Let's go for a drink.
C: MCCALL
D: I don't really like to drink.
C: ROPER
D: You have to. It's a tradition.
C: MCCALL
D: Well, if I have to, I have to.
S: INT. BILLY GOAT TAVERN - NIGHT
N: A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half- finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper studies him.
C: ROPER
D: You got a girlfriend?
C: MCCALL
D: Why? You like my ass?
N: McCall misses the shot.
C: ROPER
D: Better than your pool game.
N: Roper lines up his shot.
C: ROPER
D: You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
C: MCCALL
D: I don't gamble.
N: Roper smiles. Sinks his shot. Moves around the table.
C: MCCALL
D: Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
C: ROPER
D: You living together?
C: MCCALL
D: She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
C: ROPER
D: Explain how that works.
C: MCCALL
D: She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
C: ROPER
D: She grow up in Livingtston, too?
C: MCCALL
D: No, no, no... She's from Hoboken.
E: as if that were unthinkable a beat
C: ROPER
D: Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
C: MCCALL
D: We see each other every couple of months.
C: ROPER
D: Every couple of months, huh?
N: A couple of months sounds like an awful long time to Roper.
C: ROPER
D: That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
C: MCCALL
D: Do you really?
C: ROPER
D: No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
C: MCCALL
D: Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
E: a beat
C: ROPER
D: Where did you hear that?
C: MCCALL
D: Around. Barnett's tough competition.
C: ROPER
D: Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
N: A beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper. Roper misses his shot. Picks up his beer glass.
C: ROPER
D: Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
C: MCCALL
D: I think I can handle that one.
C: ROPER
D: Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
N: Roper takes a drink of beer. Nears the bottom of his glass. Calls to the BARTENDER.
C: ROPER
D: Zack, another round.
N: Roper turns back to McCall.
C: ROPER
D: My partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl. He got caught in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner and the bad guy... Weird thing is, if he was alive, he'd probably do it again. Some people never learn.
E: takes the last sip a beat
N: Roper puts down his glass.
C: ROPER
D: You think you can learn, McCall?
C: MCCALL
D: I think so.
N: Roper nods. Maybe he can.
S: INT. ROOM - DAY
N: We're looking at a door. It's not clear where we are. McCall enters. We only see his face. Determined.
C: MCCALL
D: I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?
N: REVERSE ANGLE It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie- talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out of it.
C: BAD GUY
D: What the fuck do you think is going on, turdhead? I'm about to waste everyone in this place.
N: McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response. He seems stiff and awkward.
C: MCCALL
D: H... how can I help you? Tell me what... I feel stupid talking to a dummy.
E: looks off to his right
N: Roper enters the training room from a side door. He's holding the other walkie-talkie.
C: ROPER
D: What did you think? I'm going to let you practice on real people?
N: Roper comes up beside him.
C: ROPER
D: First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you." Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
E: addressing the mannequin turns back to McCall
C: MCCALL
D: No.
C: ROPER
D: It'll come. Try again.
S: INT. TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: ANGLE ON THE DOOR. McCall comes in. The room has the same set-up. McCall takes a look around. Launches immediately into...
C: MCCALL
D: My name's McCall. I'm a hostage negotiator. I'm here to help you.
N: Roper's voice crackles back at him hostilely.
C: ROPER
D: How are you going to help me?
E: V.O.
N: McCall's confidence is growing.
C: MCCALL
D: Tell me what you need.
C: ROPER
D: I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
E: V.O.
N: Now he's stumped.
C: MCCALL
D: I can't do that.
E: hesitantly
C: ROPER
D: Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
E: V.O.
N: McCall looks up to his right.
C: MCCALL
D: Is all the name calling necessary.
N: Roper re-enters the training area.
C: ROPER
D: Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
C: MCCALL
D: So what do I say to this guy?
E: exasperated
C: ROPER
D: You could say something like, "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
E: addressing the dummy
C: MCCALL
D: What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
N: Roper turns to McCall.
C: ROPER
D: If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
C: MCCALL
D: I'm not good at lying.
C: ROPER
D: Get good at it.
C: MCCALL
D: It's against my nature.
N: Roper gives him an amused smile.
C: ROPER
D: You know the ten commandments?
C: MCCALL
D: Yes.
C: ROPER
D: What's the first commandment?
C: MCCALL
D: Thou shall have no other God before me.
N: That's not the answer Roper wanted.
C: ROPER
D: Okay, forget that. What's the main one.
N: McCall is tired of guessing.
C: MCCALL
D: You tell me.
C: ROPER
D: Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
C: MCCALL
D: Yes.
C: ROPER
D: Why?
C: MCCALL
D: To save lives.
C: ROPER
D: So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
N: McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back to the side door.
C: ROPER
D: Let's try it again.
S: INT. TRAINING ROOM - LATER
N: McCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the floor.
C: MCCALL
D: My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
C: ROPER
D: Okay, stop.
E: V.O.
N: Roper comes through the side door.
C: ROPER
D: Close your eyes.
N: McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper turns him away from the hostage scene.
C: ROPER
D: What did you see?
C: MCCALL
D: A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
E: rapid-fire
N: McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.
C: ROPER
D: Very good. You've got good eyes. That's important.
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video tape. It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety. Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over at him. The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face.
C: MCCALL
D: Was that your partner?
N: Roper nods.
C: MCCALL
D: Why did he do it?
C: ROPER
D: Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire. Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
E: quietly a sad beat
N: McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back on the screen.
S: EXT. GOLDEN GATE RACETRACK - DAY
N: Beautiful day. Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at the walking ring. The horses are being paraded and saddled. Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. McCall seems totally disinterested.
C: ROPER
D: You know why I like the track?
C: MCCALL
D: You're a compulsive gambler?
N: Roper ignores that.
C: ROPER
D: Because there are a multitude of possibility's. Everything is there to see if you know what to look for. You have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation.
N: Roper points across the ring to a particular horse.
C: ROPER
D: See the four horse. Dropping in class. No works. Front wraps. Looks like he's broken down. But notice the woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. She wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down. He's live. We use him.
N: McCall listens indifferently.
C: ROPER
D: See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out. What do you think?
E: turns to McCall
C: MCCALL
D: I have two words for you... Seek help.
C: ROPER
D: I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
S: INT. BETTING WINDOWS - DAY
N: Roper is buying tickets. McCall is with him, watching the other bettors, the odds board, all the monitors... Strange place. Roper finishes and turns away from the window. Hands McCall a ticket.
C: ROPER
D: I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
C: MCCALL
D: I do.
E: puzzled
S: EXT. SEATING AREA - DAY
N: Roper and McCall pass by a gambler.
C: GAMBLER
D: Hey, Roper.
C: ROPER
D: How you doin', Marv?
N: They sit down in a box right up front.
C: ROPER
D: We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
C: MCCALL
D: Fine.
E: no enthusiasm
N: Roper uses his binoculars to watch the horses warm up on the backstretch.
C: MCCALL
D: I'm told that newspaper photographer is your former girlfriend.
N: Roper looks over at him. What's this about?
C: ROPER
D: Ronnie... Yeah, so.
C: MCCALL
D: Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
C: ROPER
D: So what do you want?... An autograph.
C: MCCALL
D: I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
N: Roper throws McCall a skeptical look.
C: MCCALL
D: I'm just practicing my lying.
E: straight-faced
C: ROPER
D: Still needs work.
C: MCCALL
D: You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
E: downcast
C: TRACK ANNOUNCER
D: And they're racing!
E: O.S.
N: ON THE TRACK The horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call plays through race) IN THE STANDS Roper watches intently through the binoculars. McCall sits impassively.
C: ROPER
D: Okay, we're in good shape. We're in good shape.
N: McCall looks across the track.
C: MCCALL
D: The 6 horse is last.
C: ROPER
D: That's okay. That's his style.
C: MCCALL
D: To run last?
C: ROPER
D: To run late!
N: Roper follows the horses into the turn.
C: ROPER
D: The favorite's fading. I told you he wasn't going to run today... The four horse has got the lead!
N: McCall sits like a wax figure.
C: MCCALL
D: The 6 horse is still last.
E: cynically
C: ROPER
D: He'll be running at the quarter pole.
N: ON THE TRACK The horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses with every stride.
C: ROPER
D: There he goes.
E: V.O.
N: IN THE STANDS McCall sits forward slightly.
C: MCCALL
D: They need to run first and second?
C: ROPER
D: Yeah, first and second.
N: Roper gets to his feet. ON THE TRACK The horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in front and the SIX is coming on from behind. IN THE STANDS Roper is on his feet screaming.
C: ROPER
D: Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.
N: McCall jumps to this feet and joins him.
C: MCCALL COME ON RUSSELL!...
D: Who the fuck's Russell?!
E: to Roper
C: ROPER
D: The jockey!
C: MCCALL
D: COME ON, RUSSELL!
N: Roper and McCall cheer together. ON THE TRACK The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second... He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the wire and... It's too close to call. IN THE STANDS McCall, really excited, turns to Roper.
C: MCCALL
D: We won!
C: ROPER
D: We lost.
E: disheartened
C: MCCALL
D: We won.
E: confidently
C: ROPER
D: How much you wanna bet?
C: MCCALL
D: You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
N: ANGLE ON TOTE BOARD As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on... 4-6-8. They won. IN THE STANDS
C: ROPER
D: Yes!
N: High fives.
C: ROPER
D: That's eight hundred bucks.
S: INT. BET/CASH WINDOW - DAY
N: Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece, not bad. McCall pockets his money.
C: MCCALL
D: How long you been coming here?
C: ROPER
D: About six years. My partner took me.
C: MCCALL
D: Is it always like this?
C: ROPER
D: Occasionally you lose.
N: Suddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a cellular phone and dials.
C: ROPER
D: Roper here. I'm on my way.
E: into the phone he listens
N: He hangs up and turns to McCall.
C: ROPER
D: We gotta go.
S: EXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY
N: Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door. Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation in full swing.
S: INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
N: It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's talking to the suspect.
C: SOLIS
D: We're working on that, Joe. These things aren't quite that simple.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding.
C: MCCALL
D: This does not look good.
N: Roper looks over there, gives no reaction. They reach Solis' convertible Cadillac. It's parked out front of the travel agency building.
C: ROPER
D: See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
C: MCCALL
D: Police corruption. It's everywhere.
S: INT. COMMAND POST - DAY
N: Roper and McCall enter. McCall joins the men who are studying the blueprint. Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note of the poster of Tahiti. Looks inviting.
C: SOLIS
D: This will take time to setup. I'll have to get authorizations. Okay, you relax, and I'll --
E: he listens
N: Solis pulls the phone away from his ear. Joe has obviously hung up.
C: ROPER
D: What do we got?
C: SOLIS
D: 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
C: ROPER
D: Any verification on numbers.
C: SOLIS
D: We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
C: ROPER
D: What have you promised them?
C: SOLIS
D: Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
N: McCall returns from checking out the blueprints.
C: ROPER
D: Any good points of entry?
N: McCall shakes his head.
C: MCCALL
D: The place is designed to be a vault.
N: Roper picks up the cellular phone. It dials automatically.
C: ROPER
D: My name's Roper. How are you people doing in there? Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm the guy authorized to give you whatever you want. That's right, but first I need to come down there to talk to you.
E: into the phone he listens listens
S: INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
N: We don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of the phone. He's wearing a ski mask and gloves. Totally unrecognizable to the audience. We will find out soon that he is, in fact, Korda. He appears very cool and collected.
C: KORDA
D: You don't have to come here.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY
C: ROPER
D: Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
N: A long pause... Then a bit sinister.
C: KORDA
D: Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
E: V.O.
C: ROPER
D: Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
N: Roper clicks off the phone. He already doesn't like the sound of this guy.
S: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE - DAY
N: Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store. It's quiet now. The choppers have been pulled back. Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. Korda cracks the door open.
C: KORDA
D: Stay there.
E: warningly
N: Roper stops in his tracks.
C: ROPER
D: I'm going to put my hands down, okay.
N: Roper slowly lowers his hands.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER
N: Everybody watching through the window.
S: EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
N: Korda takes a half step out the doorway. The gloved hand that is visible is not holding a weapon. The other half of his body is hidden inside the doorway. He wears jeans, a black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes. He stares fiercely from behind the ski mask. There's no sign of fear in him.
C: KORDA
D: Are you in charge, Roper?
C: ROPER
D: Yep.
C: KORDA
D: I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
N: Korda lets that sink in.
C: KORDA
D: I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
C: ROPER
D: Is that all?
C: KORDA
D: For now that's all.
C: ROPER
D: You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
C: KORDA
D: No. You just do shit for me right now.
N: Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. He's an ominous figure.
C: ROPER
D: Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
C: KORDA
D: I'll give you something.
N: Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and tosses it to Roper. Roper unwraps the handkerchief. DETAIL SHOT It's a human ear.
C: KORDA
D: In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece. I assume there are no "misunderstanding".
N: Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him.
C: ROPER
D: I understand you completely.
N: Korda disappears back behind the door.
S: EXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY
N: Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis, McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for his report.
C: ROPER
D: We're going to have to take this guy out.
E: flatly
N: That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely says.
C: SOLIS
D: Can't we wear him down?
N: Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis eyes it with dismay.
C: ROPER
D: I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques. So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out?
E: a beat
N: McCall calmly offers his opinion.
C: MCCALL
D: Let him come out. Too many unknowns in there.
N: Solis nods. That'll be the plan.
C: MCCALL
D: When we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb. Put our best man "highground", Twenty degree down angle.
E: to SWAT Captain
N: The SWAT Captain motions and turns to one of his UNDERLINGS.
C: SWAT CAPTAIN
D: Have Anderson prep it and notify us when he's on line.
N: The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at Roper dejectedly.
C: SOLIS
D: I feel this thing going sideways on us.
N: Roper tries to buck him up.
C: ROPER
D: There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages... Yet.
E: big pause
S: INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
N: The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda. His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The guard and one of the jewelers. Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies.
C: KORDA
D: Drag them behind the counter.
N: The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality. Her eyes are a bit far away. Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction.
C: WOMAN CUSTOMER
D: I'm not staying here another minute.
N: SALESGIRL #1 (panicky) No, Mrs. Dotson. Korda rushes around the display case.
C: KORDA
D: Come here, hag.
N: He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a step toward Korda.
C: MANAGER
D: Leave her alone!
N: Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.
C: KORDA
D: You're a brave one, aren't you?
N: The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks about making a run at him. SALESGIRL #2 (pleading) Sit down, Doug. A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old woman. Korda looks down at her.
C: KORDA
D: If she's not conscious when it's time to leave, I'll have to kill her.
N: Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of the gems.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Cops clear spectators out of the way as a green FORD EXPLORER RUMBLES through the barricade and heads down the deserted street.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY
N: Roper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store. The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store. Parks at a slight angle. The uniformed police officer gets out, leaving the engine running, and walks off back to the barricade.
C: ROPER
D: Okay. Time to give this fucker a call.
N: Roper picks up the phone, waits. Everybody tensely watching the store. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. BUILDING - SAME
N: A sniper team watching the store from a third floor window.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME
N: Roper holding the phone. It's still ringing.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - DIFFERENT BUILDING - SAME
N: Another sharpshooting team. Poised. Waiting.
S: EXT. ANOTHER ROOFTOP - SAME
N: And still another sharpshooter team.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME
N: The phone is still ringing.
C: ROPER
D: This fucker's not answering.
N: Just then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open. A spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway. Korda is discharging a fire extinguisher.
C: MCCALL
D: There's your answer. He's smart.
C: ROPER
D: He's cutting down the visibility.
C: MCCALL
D: And doing a very good job of it.
N: A thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the front of the jewelry store. Roper puts down the phone.
C: MCCALL
D: Come on. Give us one clean shot.
C: SWAT CAPTAIN
D: All positions, you have the green light.
E: into his radio
C: MCCALL
D: They're out.
N: Roper grabs a pair of binoculars. HIS POV Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled around the figure in the ski mask. They slowly shuffle toward the Explorer. McCall watches intently.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME
N: A sniper watches through his scope. Finger poised on the trigger. ANGLE THROUGH THE SCOPE Low visibility through the haze. The figure in the ski mask wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs. The sniper tries to lock him in.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER - ROPER'S POV - BINOCULARS - SAME
N: The figure in the ski mask leans slightly and Roper catches a glimpse of the hostage right behind him. Roper recognizes him instantly.
C: ROPER
D: It's Korda.
N: McCall sees him now, too.
C: MCCALL
D: They switched clothes.
N: Roper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio.
C: ROPER
D: Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
E: urgently
N: Too late. A SHOT rings out. The figure in the ski mask goes down, hit by the bullet.
C: ROPER
D: Shit! Where'd that shot come from? Hold your fire!
N: More SHOTS ring out. DOWN ON THE STREET The white vapor cloud swirls. The hostages, spattered with blood, scream and scatter. The figure in the ski mask lies dead on the sidewalk. Korda, dressed in the manager's three piece suit, holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and his gun in the other FIRES back at the snipers. He grabs salesgirl 1 and drags her into the Explorer.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER
N: Roper sees Korda move toward the car with one of the hostages.

S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van... Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit. THE VAN hits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back down to the pavement.
S: INT. VAN - DAY
N: Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the windshield as they head straight downhill. The salesgirl is beyond petrified. THE CADILLAC reaches the top of the hill. Going fast.
S: INT. CADILLAC
N: As it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against the pavement. McCall sees the van ahead. Hammers the accelerator. No fear. VAN Korda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a hard left. THE VAN cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk... shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through the air... The van speeds off down a one-way street... THE CADILLAC arrives at the intersection a few seconds later... Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through the corner. THE VAN Wrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in every angle. Frantic HONKING. Salesgirl SHRIEKS. Tires SMOKING... No way to avoid collision... Except Korda pulls a left an instant before impact... The van speeds back up the hill. THE CADILIAC Down the same one way street... Comes up on the head-on traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near collision with Korda...
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: The Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill.
S: INT. VAN
N: Korda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short distance behind. Attention still focused behind, Korda enters an intersection, running a red light... CROSS-TRAFFIC... Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel THE STREET The van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal... SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car... BRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a dizzying roll... THE VAN ...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend. He heads toward it...
S: INT. CABLE CAR
N: As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the passengers view him uneasily. THE CADILLAC hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to see Korda leap onto the moving cable car. CABLE CAR other passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back... Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is making up ground on the cable car. Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a couple of shots at the Caddy.
S: INT. CADILLAC
N: A bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves. BACK ON THE CABLE CAR That makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap off the cable car. Korda takes aim on the Caddy again and FIRES! The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off the cable car... Almost works... but Korda is able to hang on by one hand... He swings around toward the Brakeman who turns involuntarily as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him... BANG! Korda shoots him in the back. The brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the brake lever, releasing it more.
S: EXT. UNDER CABLE CAR
N: The brakes are stressed.

C: MCCALL
D: You're crazy.

S: EXT. INTERSECTION
N: The cable car barrels through... Plows into two cross-traffic cars... Knocks them aside... Keeps picking up speed. THE CADILLAC Weaves through the wreckage... Makes up ground on the cable car, trying to pull alongside. THE CABLE CAR For the moment, Korda is not shooting at the Caddy. His attention is now focused downhill as... KORDA'S POV The cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off to the side. THE CADDY dodges the spinning car... Jumps up onto the sidewalk... Mows down parking meters... Jumps back onto the street. THE CABLE CAR Korda leans out the door, takes aim at the Caddy... Another jammed intersection up ahead...
S: INT. CAR OF MAN TRAPPED IN INTERSECTION
N: He sees the cable car coming in his rear view mirror. He bails out... THE CABLE CAR SLAMS into the back of the car. Major impact. THE CABLE CAR Korda and the passengers are thrown to the floor.

Roper climbs over the windshield, onto the hood and leaps onto the cable car.
S: INT. CABLE CAR
N: Korda sees him coming. FIRES. Roper dives out the other side of the cable car. CABLE CAR Roper hanging off the side. He gets his gun out of his holster... Up ahead, a car pulls away from the curb... Roper swings around to get back into the relative safety of the cable car. As he does his gun is raked out of his hand by the car which avoids a collision by a millimeter. CABLE CAR Korda aims as Roper re-enters... CABLE CAR As it CRASHES into the back of a car turning left. Everyone is thrown toward the front of the car. Korda's gun goes flying. Roper dives on top of him. They trade punches. McCall is in b.g. with the Caddy pacing the cable car. INTERSECTION Pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks through... THE CABLE CAR Roper hammers Korda into unconsciousness. Outside McCall is honking and yelling like crazy. Roper looks over... McCall points ahead... ROPER'S POV The cable car. ROPER Leaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it. ANGLE UNDER THE CABLE CAR The clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes... Then disintegrates before our eyes. THE CABLE CAR Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy...
S: INT. CADDY
N: He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car... McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the steering wheel hard right...
S: EXT. STREET
N: The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac... But it's working. The cable car is slowing. BOTTOM OF STREET The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on them. General hysteria as they flee. THE CABLE CAR Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs the satchel and bails out of the cable car... STREET ...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs into an underground garage. THE CABLE CAR Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in astonishment.
S: INT. GARAGE - DAY
N: Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position. He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the garage... Footsteps maybe. Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...
S: INT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE
N: Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans beneath the cars... No sign of Korda. Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward the window. A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth... Roper moves on. NEW ANGLE As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution. Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat.
C: ROPER
D: Sorry, go.
N: INSIDE THE CAR The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives off.
S: INT. GARAGE
N: Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might have escaped. He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield. The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it. GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and piles into a parked car. Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck. Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his gun right up between Korda's eyes.
C: ROPER
D: Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here.
N: Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't kill him in cold blood... What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about those rules at this moment.
C: ROPER
D: You know Sam Baffert was a friend of mine. He had a wife... and he had a daughter.
N: Korda stares past the barrel of the gun.
C: KORDA
D: I don't give a shit about you or your fucking friends.
N: And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night. He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing this guy.
C: KORDA
D: You can't kill me like this.
C: ROPER
D: What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
N: In a flash, Roper points the gun upward and fires off a SHOT!
C: ROPER
D: Could I kill you then? Could I kill you then?
E: beat, beat
N: Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull. And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed. Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst out of his skin. ANGLE - MCCALL moving across garage into position.
C: MCCALL
D: Roper! Put it down!... Put it down man, we got him. Come on... Put it down.
E: beat
N: Long, long beat. Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls his head back and shoves the gun in his face.
C: ROPER
D: We do this shit by the book, but you ain't gonna be smiling.
N: Korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood. Roper walks away as McCall moves in to put the cuffs on Korda. Sequence omitted from original script.

C: RONNIE
D: You weren't at the press conference.
N: Roper keeps tapping away at the computer.
C: ROPER

N: She nods knowingly.
C: RONNIE
D: It's already started.
C: ROPER
D: I was going to catch the last half on TV.
N: Ronnie watches him for a moment. He stops typing, looks at her and smiles. She suddenly becomes self-conscious. Guess it was something she was thinking.
C: RONNIE
D: Good-night.

C: ROPER

C: ROPER

C: RONNIE
D: Yeah that's it.
C: ROPER
D: Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
C: RONNIE
D: Scottie...
E: laughing
N: There is a long pause as he looks at her.
C: ROPER
D: What would you say if I quit gambling?
N: Ronnie stirs the macaroni.
C: RONNIE
D: I'd say you'd be miserable... It's not the gambling. It's what the gambling got in the way of. The track is where you'd take your troubles instead of sharing them with me...
N: Ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni. There is a beat before she continues.
C: RONNIE
D: Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
C: ROPER
D: It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
C: RONNIE
D: It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
C: ROPER
D: Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
E: beat
N: The dog yawns. They laugh. Roper moves closer to her. He kisses her and she responds.
S: INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

C: KORDA
D: You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.

C: KORDA

S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door... throws it open. She looks around. Something's not right.

She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored medicine cabinet. IN THE REFLECTION Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there. She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the floor further down the hallway... What is it? She moves closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.
T: BRIEF CUT
N: A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers. BACK IN THE HALL Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint. She reaches down to touch it... BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.
S: INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around for something... We're sure that when she closes the door, he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce and... Closes the door... Still no one there. She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse... RIP! She pulls away. IN THE HALLWAY She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of reach.
S: EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps out behind him. It's raining harder. They hurry up the walkway toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine. He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him. Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check himself in the window. Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house. FLICKERING and FLASHING. Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He shoulders it again...

S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection... HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the intersection... Into the shadows.
S: EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT
N: This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back. Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence is faltering. NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL Clarence staggers into an alleyway...
S: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
N: Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound. He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out. Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight. Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked. Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light of the street... Slowly... The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper across the arm. Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car and grabs the gun... Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers. WIDER SHOT Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly. Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM! He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of his vehicle.
C: CABBY
D: Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!
N: Roper walks down the hill to the body. The cabby follows.
C: CABBY
D: There was no way I could miss him.
N: Roper ignores the cabby. He looks down at Clarence's body, contemplating something.
C: CABBY
D: This isn't my fault.
C: ROPER
D: Shut the fuck up!
N: The cabby immediately clams up.
C: ROPER
D: Get on your radio and get the police here.

S: INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY
N: Korda is led in again. An expression of surprise registers on his face when he sees who's waiting for him. KORDA'S POV Roper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall. KORDA Dons a smug expression and takes a seat. He picks up his receiver as Roper picks up his.
C: ROPER
D: If you try again to hurt me or anyone I know, I'm going to have you killed.
N: Korda feigns total innocence.
C: KORDA
D: What in the world are you talking about, Mr. Roper?
N: Roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the glass.
C: ROPER
D: Here's a picture of your cousin Clarence. That gentleman standing over him is the coroner.
N: Korda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His countenance is now a study in hate.
C: KORDA
D: I used to have an apartment, a car, jewelry. I had a fucking eight thousand dollar watch. Now look what I have.
N: He motions around.
C: KORDA
D: You're threatening me? You think I give a fuck? You think you can scare me off? Why don't you come in here and kick my ass? Get some of your guard friends in here to help. I'd like that.
E: a laugh
N: Roper glares at him mounting rage.
C: KORDA
D: He really shook you up, didn't he?... I've got ten years worth of appeals to figure out how to fuck with you. Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer will get me out on a technicality.
E: smirking
N: Roper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless.
C: KORDA
D: You came here to threaten me? That's a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me... Go ahead. Get down on your knees.
N: Roper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against the plexiglass wall.
C: ROPER
D: You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill you!
N: The guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away from the glass wall. Roper pushes him off and gathers himself. He gives Korda one last stare. Korda sits there smirking back at him... Roper turns his back and walks out.

D: He's on his way. Get over there.
S: EXT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - DAY
N: A VETERAN wearing green fatigue is dangling another WHEELCHAIR BOUND VET over the edge. Fourteen floors up. The two front wheels are literally hanging out there in space. VET #1 (rambling incoherently) I can't fight this technology. They have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments. I've seen those places. Everyone is dressed in white. It's like paper clothing, man. They're not even human. Vet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped into the street 150 feet below. He is, needless to say, very panicky. VET #2 Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me in. We'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way. But he's not getting through to his friend. VET #1 I can't help this, man. Do you have any idea what those microchips look like? How small they are when they put them in your brain?
S: INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
N: Leading to the roof. A COUPLE OF COPS and MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL STAFF peek out at the vet as he continues to rant and rave. McCall arrives at the top of the stairs. OFFICER #4 sure looks happy to see him. McCall takes a peek out onto the roof. He isn't happy about what he sees. OFFICER #4 When we got here, he was already doing his balancing act. I was talking to him, but it made him more agitated so I backed off.
C: MCCALL
D: Why is he up there?
N: OFFICER #4 Something about a microchip in his brain.
C: MCCALL
D: Who is he?
N: A NURSE answers him.
C: NURSE HERRIN
D: David Adler. He likes to be called Dave. The other guy is Walter Sinclair.
N: We hear the urgent cry of the vet in the wheelchair.
C: VOICE
D: Somebody help me out here. Somebody stop him.
E: V.O.
N: The nurse turns to McCall.
C: NURSE HERRIN
D: What are you waiting for?
C: MCCALL
D: Another negotiator is on his way.
C: NURSE HERRIN
D: We can't wait for another negotiator. You have to do something.
C: MCCALL
D: What about the doctors?
C: NURSE HERRIN
D: He hates all the doctors. He says they're in on the conspiracy.
N: VET #1 (O.S.) Where is everybody? He's going to kill me! McCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof.
S: EXT. ROOF - DAY
N: McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's heart jumps into his mouth.
C: DAVE
D: Get the fuck out of here!
N: McCall is tense and stiff. He stammers.
C: MCCALL
D: I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
C: DAVE
D: You can't help me, man.
N: So much for McCall's opener. Now what?
C: WALTER
D: He's high on something, man. Give him some thorazine or something.
N: Dave ignores Walter.
C: DAVE
D: No one can help me. They're controlling my mind.
N: McCall moves a couple steps closer.
C: MCCALL
D: Who's controlling your mind?
C: DAVE
D: Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
N: McCall fumbles for the right response.
C: MCCALL
D: This has nothing to do with Walter.
C: DAVE
D: They want Walter dead!
S: EXT. STREET BELOW - DAY
N: Cops keep spectators back from the building. Fire trucks and rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over the side of the building.
S: EXT. ROOF - DAY
N: Walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat, eyes closed, praying.
C: MCCALL
D: Dave, look at me.
N: Dave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.
C: MCCALL
D: Tell me what's wrong.
C: DAVE
D: Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
C: MCCALL
D: How can I help you with the particles?
C: DAVE
D: It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
N: Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the armrests of his wheelchair and then:
C: MCCALL
D: They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
E: blurting out
C: DAVE
D: Huh?
N: McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is. Dave turns back around.
C: DAVE
D: Huh?
S: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
N: Roper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a halt. He leaps out and speaks to a FIREMAN.
C: ROPER
D: Whata ya got?
C: FIREMAN
D: Some nuts dangling a guy over the edge in a wheelchair.
C: ROPER
D: Can you get a net out here?
C: FIREMAN
D: Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets gonna hold a fall from that high up.
S: EXT. ROOF - DAY
N: McCall nods slowly. Sweat pouring off him.
C: MCCALL
D: We've been onto them for a long time.
N: A glimmer from Dave. Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit.
C: MCCALL
D: Let me show you something.
N: Now he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his beeper.
C: MCCALL
D: See this. I'm jamming them, Dave. I'm jamming their frequency so they can't control your mind anymore. Don't you feel that? You don't have to do what they say.
N: Dave listens to his head.
C: WALTER
D: He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me back in.
C: MCCALL
D: You see, the particles are gone, they can't punish you anymore.
N: Dave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes.
C: DAVE
D: Tell my dad.
C: MCCALL
D: Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
C: DAVE
D: Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
C: MCCALL
D: I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
N: Dave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns to a frown:
C: DAVE
D: I hate fucking Springfield.
C: MCCALL
D: Is that where you're family lives?
N: Then with sudden swiftness.
C: DAVE
D: I still hear them, man. You can't jam them. They've got the technology, man. They've got the satellites, Jack. They keep shooting beams off those satellites. What power do I have?
N: Dave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls.
C: MCCALL
D: NOOOO!
N: WALTER AND HIS WHEELCHAIR freefall down toward earth in SLOW MOTION. The wheelchair turns end over end. People SCREAM as Walter IMPACTS with the pavement. The wheelchair CRASHES down nearby. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: EXT. ROOF - DAY
N: McCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below. Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands behind his back. The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out to restrain.
S: INT. LOBBY - DAY
N: The crowd is dispersing. Roper is talking with some of the other cops. McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down the stairs. Roper moves toward him.
C: ROPER
D: McCall!
N: No response. McCall gets into his ND Sedan car and fires it up.
C: ROPER
D: McCall!
N: Roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car screeches away from the curb. BAY BRIDGE - DAY McCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in the car with him. He drives. Stone-faced. Roper studies him for a beat.
C: ROPER
D: Where are we going?
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Moving POV thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign that says "Golden Gate Racetrack."
S: EXT. RACETRACK
N: Establish grand stands. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. BETTING AREA - DAY
N: McCall pounds over to the betting window. Roper leans up against the window beside him. Watches.
C: MCCALL
D: Give me a twenty dollar four-six exacta.
C: TELLER
D: The six is scratched.
N: This throws McCall for a beat.
C: MCCALL
D: Then give me a fucking four-seven exacta.
N: The teller punches out the ticket. McCall takes the ticket and pounds over to box seat area. Roper follows a couple of steps behind, giving him some space.
S: EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY
N: McCall sits down in the same box as the last time. Roper sits down next to him.
S: EXT. TRACK - DAY
N: The horses go into the gate.
S: EXT. BOX SEAT AREA - DAY
N: McCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call plays over the scene.)
C: MCCALL
D: Come on four horse! Come on Seven horse!
N: Roper isn't watching the horse. He's watching McCall. Watching him redirect all his pent up emotion. Understanding exactly how he feels. McCall is screaming his head off.
C: MCCALL
D: Come on four-seven... Come on... Come on... Come on...
N: The horses cross the wire. The four and seven finish mid- pack. McCall hangs his head in despair. He didn't give a shit about the race. He looks inconsolable.
C: ROPER
D: It might have happened no matter who was up there.
C: MCCALL
D: Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
C: ROPER
D: Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
C: MCCALL
D: I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy. It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
E: beat
C: ROPER
D: That it is.
N: A long silent beat.
C: MCCALL
D: How many have you lost?
C: ROPER
D: I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
C: MCCALL
D: And what about the ones you don't save?
C: ROPER
D: You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
C: MCCALL
D: And what if you can't live with it?
C: ROPER
D: You've got to decide that for yourself.
N: McCall squeezes his eyes closed. He can still see that vet falling to his death. Roper can see McCall's pain.
C: ROPER
D: I've lost three. One of them was my partner. I think about them every time I go into a situation. There's a million people in this city with all kinds of twisted shit going on in their heads, and the bitch of this job is that we expect to go out every day and do the impossible -- to somehow control all this craziness... and we can't. Nobody's faulting you for this, McCall. My advice is you let yourself off the hook.
E: a beat a beat
N: McCall hears him but is still undecided.
C: MCCALL
D: I don't know... I don't know...
N: Roper gets up, stands over McCall, puts a hand on his shoulder.
C: ROPER
D: Let's get out of here.
N: McCall slowly gets up and they walk out.
S: INT. JAIL - DAY
N: It's a small interview room. Korda sits opposite bail bondsman JOHN HAWKINS (white, grizzled, forty).
C: HAWKINS
D: What the fuck... You bring me all the way over here to tell me you've got no collateral! What do I look like to you -- Santa Claus? I'm a bail bondsman!
C: KORDA
D: No, no, see what I'm sayin' is, I've got the --
C: HAWKINS
D: Pick up a fucking phone for chrissake! You think I got time for this crap?
C: KORDA
D: Hey, hey, I got shit on the outside. I got somebody cashing it in for me and --
N: Hawkins gets up and goes to the door.
C: HAWKINS
D: Gimme a fuckin' break.
C: KORDA
D: Alright, alright, look, man, look, just leave me your card. I can get it to you by tomorrow night.
N: Hawkins looks at him skeptically for a beat. Then pulls out his BUSINESS CARD and hands it to him. He walks out the door as we HOLD on Korda -- pocketing the card.
S: EXT. POSTRIO - NIGHT
N: Establishing shot.
S: INT. POSTRIO - NIGHT

E: snootily
C: WAITER
D: The special this evening is braised sweetbreads with a white truffle sauce on cracked bulgar.
N: Roper looks at him a long beat.
C: ROPER
D: That's my favorite. Why don't you give us a minute.
E: smiles
N: The waiter retreats. Roper looks across the table at Ronnie as she sips her wine.
C: ROPER
D: You like this place?
C: RONNIE
D: It's very nice.
C: ROPER
D: I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
N: She didn't realize that. Now she's getting nervous.
C: RONNIE
D: There is?
C: ROPER
D: For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
N: Now she's really worried.
C: RONNIE
D: Yeah?
C: ROPER
D: ...Let me just show you.
N: Roper reaches into his coat pocket.
C: RONNIE
D: Scottie, we should think this over before we...
N: He pulls out two airline tickets.
C: ROPER
D: Tahiti.
N: Ronnie is immensely relieved.
C: RONNIE
D: Ohhh... A vacation... Yeah that sounds like a great idea.
N: Roper notices her relief and for the first time realizes what she was thinking.
C: ROPER
D: Oh you thought I was going to ask you...
N: Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed.
C: ROPER
D: Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out...
N: Roper picks up his menu and peruses it.
C: ROPER
D: I assume you're having your usual -- the "air dried venison".
S: INT. HALLWAY JAIL - DAY CLOSE ON
N: The wheels of a laundry cart, moving slowly down the hall. A white metal door slides open, and the cart passes through.
S: INT. PROPERTY ROOM JAIL - CONTINUOUS
N: As the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see KORDA pushing the cart. He stops. A GUARD (guard #3) stands with his back to Korda. He's on the phone.
C: KORDA
D: Got another load.
N: JAIL GUARD #3 Rack 'em up. (into the phone) Look, man, if it doesn't make it down here by five it's not my problem. As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags, zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing.
C: KORDA
D: All done.
N: Korda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The guard, still on the phone, buzzes open the door. ON THE GUARDS BACK We hear Korda wheeling the cart out the door. CLOSE ANGLE on the door sliding shut. ON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE Hold a beat. PANNING SLOWLY around the room to FIND -- suit bag's moving on the trolley. BOOM DOWN to FIND Korda's feet just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the bags. ANGLE ON KORDA hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then down through an opening in the floor and into...
S: INT. BASEMENT JAIL - CONTINUOUS
N: as it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for another pair...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LONG HALLWAY JAIL - LATER
N: Korda appears around a corner, dressed in street clothes, holding a CLIPBOARD -- moving steadily toward camera. KORDA'S POV - DOWN THE HALLWAY A female civilian EMPLOYEE heading in his direction. As they pass he nods and she nods back. Then Korda passes through a door at the end of the hallway and into... Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS
N: The door closes behind him and locks with the loud SNAP of metal. Slowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor toward the door at the other end, past the first GUARD (guard #3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass. TRACKING - KORDA'S FEET step by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick glass. CLOSE ON KORDA'S FACE trying to stay cool, his heart pounding. Then...
C: A VOICE
D: Hey!
E: O.S.
N: Korda FREEZES, then slowly turns to FIND... A prison GUARD (#1) moving toward him. THE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA
C: KORDA
D: ...Yeah?
N: The guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand. JAIL GUARD #1 You dropped your card. Korda takes THE CARD given to him by the bail bondsman. JAIL GUARD #1 You guys are the scum of the earth.
C: KORDA
D: Just tryin' to make a living.
N: Korda turns and walks out the door into...
S: INT. SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: It's the final step before getting out of the building. A small room with another GUARD (Latino; guard #2) behind glass, and several TV monitors. A BLACK WOMAN (forty-five) is arguing with a LATINO GUARD. JAIL GUARD #2 I don't know what to tell you, mam, your brother ain't here. Try San Bruno.
C: WOMAN
D: I just came from San Bruno -- they sent me here!
N: JAIL GUARD #2 I'm sorry. Then I don't know where he is. Korda, fidgeting behind the woman impatiently, holds up his card...
C: KORDA
D: Listen, can I just sign outta here?
C: WOMAN
D: What do you mean, you don't know where he is?! You can't just lose somebody!
N: JAIL GUARD #2 (to Korda) Who are you again?
C: KORDA
D: Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
N: JAIL GUARD #2 Johnny who?
C: WOMAN
D: Can you believe these people?
E: to Korda
C: KORDA
D: It's the criminal justice system. What can I tell ya? It's a mess.
N: The guard shoves the sheet under the glass. JAIL GUARD #2 Alright, alright, just sign. Korda signs the sheet. The guard pushes a button. The metal lock SNAPS, and the door POPS open. Korda takes his card and sticks it in the woman's coat pocket.
C: KORDA
D: If you find him, gimme a call.
N: And Korda walks out.
S: EXT. JAIL SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS
N: It's a small parking area, with security gates on either end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky. There are three or four CARS parked against the wall. Korda checks inside the first car, looking for keys and finds none. Then the second, and the third until...
C: A VOICE
D: Hey!
E: O.S.
N: Korda turns sharply to find the LATINO GUARD (guard #2), holding a clipboard, walking quickly toward him. JAIL GUARD #2 Hold on a second here.
C: KORDA
D: Is there a problem?
N: The guard walks up to him. They're standing between the cars. JAIL GUARD #2 You signed out twice.
C: KORDA
D: I what?
N: JAIL GUARD #2 Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
C: KORDA
D: Wait a minute, lemme see that.
N: As the guard shows him the sign-in sheet, Korda removes the PEN from his own clipboard.
C: KORDA
D: Well, that's funny, I wonder how that happened.
N: In a flash, Korda PLUNGES the pen DEEP into the guard's throat. The BLOOD jumps out of his throat, onto the window of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars, drowning in his own blood. Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Empty. New front door. Unpainted. Frame splintered from when Roper shot it open. We hold a beat... HEAR ROPER & RONNIE coming up the stairs. Laughing. The door opens. They enter.
C: ROPER
D: How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
C: RONNIE
D: In Europe women find older men very sexy.
N: Roper closes the door.
C: ROPER
D: When I get old and fat, I'm moving to Europe.
N: Ronnie suddenly remembers something.
C: RONNIE
D: I forgot to leave food for Paco. He's probably starving.
N: She walks back toward the kitchen. Roper takes a seat on the couch. Flips on the TV. Rubs the back of his neck.
C: ROPER
D: Damn, my eyes are tired from reading that movie.
N: FOLLOWING RONNIE She moves down the hall to the kitchen.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm sorry, Paco. I forgot --
E: doggie voice
N: But Paco isn't lying on his pillow like she expected. Curious.
C: RONNIE
D: Paco?
N: She turns around walks back down the hall... Where could he be?... She walks into the bedroom.
C: RONNIE
D: Paco?
N: He's not in here either... She walks back into the hallway. Frowns.
T: SUDDEN CUT
N: A figure leaps out of the bathroom doorway!... Big scare. It's Paco. He nearly knocked her over. He stands on his hind legs, paws on her shoulders. Breathing in her face.
C: RONNIE
D: Paco, have you been eating my face soap, again?
N: RACK FOCUS Roper standing at the other end of the hallway. Tense as a wire. Gun at his side. One look at his demeanor tells Ronnie something is very wrong.
C: RONNIE
D: What is it, Scottie?
E: very concerned
N: Roper untenses. Puts away his gun.
C: ROPER
D: Korda escaped.
C: RONNIE
D: And you think he'll...
N: Her voice trails off. He can see she's worried now, too.
C: ROPER
D: Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's relax. I'm sure he's just going to try to get out of town. Anyway we leave tomorrow.
N: He puts his arms around her waist.
C: ROPER
D: Why don't we do some of that European movie stuff.
N: She puts her arms around his shoulders.
C: RONNIE
D: I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.

D: Use your imagination.
S: EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: ANGLE looking up at her window... The light goes out.
S: EXT. RONNIE'S DOORSTEP - DAY
N: A suitcase THUMPS to the ground. Looks like somebody packed for a six month trip around the world. ANGLE WIDENS McCall grimaces as he lugs the bag toward the truck.
C: MCCALL
D: You sure you packed everything? Maybe you forgot your bowling ball.
N: Ronnie stands on the doorstep.
C: RONNIE
D: I sent that ahead, wise guy.
N: Paco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree. Roper calls to Ronnie from the stairway.
C: ROPER

S: INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

E: continuing
N: She doesn't answer. He calls out again, moving through the living room.
C: ROPER
D: Ronnie, where are you? Time to go.
E: continuing
N: No answer, the room is very quiet. Roper eases his PISTOL out from under his shirt, moving more urgently now, checking out the bathroom, bedroom...
C: ROPER
D: Ronnie.
E: continuing
N: Then he HEARS Paco, WHINING. He moves around the entrance to the kitchen. The back door is open, Paco standing in the doorway. Roper rushes forward, quickly looking outside, the alley way empty. He senses a presence behind him, spinning... McCall standing in the doorway to the kitchen. Roper's lowers the weapon...
C: ROPER
D: She's gone.
E: continuing
N: McCall sees on the kitchen table, a folded piece of GLASSINE PAPER, just like the one Korda gave Roper at the jewelry store.
C: MCCALL
D: Scott...
E: nodding
N: Roper sees it, approaching, barely able to unfold the edges, a momentary tremble in his hand.
C: ROPER
D: That son of a bitch. If he...
N: We PUSH IN as his fingers open the paper... revealing inside a MICRO CASSETTE TAPE.
C: ROPER
D: He's fucking with you, Scott, be cool... keep your head.
E: continuing; to himself
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON a TAPE RECORDER, Korda's VOICE heard over the speaker.
C: KORDA
D: I got your lady, Roper.
E: V.O. filtered laughs
N: Roper and McCall are listening closely to the tape.
C: KORDA
D: You got something that belongs to me, and I want it back. Twelve-fifteen, Mare Island, North Entrance off Dixon. Building twenty- eight, by the dry docks. I so much as smell another cop, I'll be sending you parts of this bitch for a month.
E: V.O. continuing beat beat
N: Roper punches off the tape.
C: ROPER
D: He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
C: MCCALL
D: So what do you want to do?
C: ROPER
D: That's a chance I gotta take.
C: MCCALL
D: Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
N: Roper stares at him, the wheels beginning to turn...
T: CUT TO:
N: Sequence omitted from original script.
S: INT. POLICE PROPERTY/EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Roper is standing at the counter to the steel-caged property room. On the other side is FRANK, the property sergeant on duty. The two men speak in hushed, urgent tones...
C: FRANK
D: Scott, we go back a long way but you can't expect me to do this!
C: ROPER
D: Frank, this guy is a psychopath and he's got Ronnie. It's the only way I'm going to get close to him.
C: FRANK
D: Then go to the Lieutenant or the D.A. with it, for Christsakes. You're asking me to put my fucking job on the line!
C: ROPER
D: They'll never approve it, you know that. Besides, I involve the department and she's dead. I got one chance with this guy, Frank, alone. He killed Sam and he'll kill her.
E: beat
N: Frank just stares at him, compassion and anger tearing at him.
C: ROPER
D: What if it were Mary? You'd break every fucking rule in the book... wouldn't you?
E: continuing beat
N: Frank continues to stare at him, a long beat.
C: FRANK
D: I hope to God I never have to make that decision...
N: He pushes back from the counter.
C: FRANK
D: ...and this conversation never happened. I never saw you today. Now I gotta go take a leak.
E: continuing
N: He turns and walks away. Roper looks down, SEEING that the drawer beneath Frank's counter has been left slightly open. Roper reaches over, easing it further open -- inside a set of KEYS. He looks around, then takes the keys.
C: ROPER
D: I owe you one, Frank.
N: He walks down the hallway.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ROPER'S PICKUP - DAY
N: CLOSE ON the SATCHEL Korda used in the robbery. WIDEN TO REVEAL Roper and McCall, Roper at the wheel, McCall reading a folded MAP featuring MARE ISLAND.
C: MCCALL
D: Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything. How are we going to get me in there?
E: to Roper
C: ROPER
D: Good question.
N: Roper thinks a moment, then turns, looking out the back of the pickup, in the bed a loose CANVAS TARPAULIN. He and McCall study the tarp a beat, then turn, looking at each other...
S: EXT. MARE ISLAND - DAY
N: WIDE VIEW reveals the immensity of the abandoned facility. At one end near the chain link fence, Roper's pickup approaches the gate.
S: EXT. MARE ISLAND - NORTH GATE - DAY
N: Roper cautiously drives toward the gate -- the CHAIN securing the gate has been cut. Roper swings open the gate. As he drives past we see that the bed of the truck has been loosely covered with a TARP. Roper drives on, winding through the maze of roadways, huge buildings and equipment dwarfing the truc PRODUCTION NOTE: The idea is to take us into the facility to sell that it's abandoned, immense, eerie in it's scale -- a ghost town. We end up wherever we want for the next scene.
S: INT. ROPER'S PICKUP - DAY
N: As he rounds a corner, approaching the dry dock area, huge CRANES and mothballed SHIPS in the b.g. He parks near a building, a weathered SIGN reading: BLD 28. Roper shuts off the engine, leaving the keys in the ignition. Taking the satchel he opens the door.
S: EXT. DRY DOCK AREA - DAY
N: Roper steps out, eyes scanning the buildings, the cranes... Korda could be anywhere up there, watching.
S: INT. BUILDING - UPPER LEVEL - DAY
N: KORDA'S POV through the filthy windows, Roper far below, standing beside his pickup.
S: EXT. ROPER - DAY
N: As he moves away from the truck, holding the satchel.
C: ROPER
D: Korda!
N: In response he HEARS Korda's VOICE, eerie, almost a whisper, coming from everywhere and nowhere as if emanating from the ground and the buildings all at once.
C: KORDA
D: Nice of you to make it, Roper. Take your jacket off, put it on the hood.
E: O.S. filtered
N: Roper complies, his eyes searching the buildings, where is his voice coming from?
C: KORDA
D: Now, over to the chains, to your left.
E: O.S. continuing
N: Roper SEES a chained off section nearby. Roper takes a few steps when Korda's voice stops him...
C: KORDA
D: But first, let's have a look under the tarp. Pull it back.
E: O.S. continuing
N: A momentary anxious look from Roper, then he walks to the bed of the truck, pausing a moment, gripping the cover before whipping it back, revealing... Ronnie's LUGGAGE.
T: CUT TO:
N: LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK McCall supported under the frame by a makeshift HARNESS around his waist and legs.
C: KORDA
D: All right, move it.
E: O.S.
N: McCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness, lowering himself to the ground. Quickly he moves the SMOKING LEATHER GLOVES he was wearing, burned by contact with the hot exhaust pipe. ROPER Reaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK, easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long. At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice.
C: KORDA
D: Throw in and your piece.
E: O.S. continuing
N: Roper tosses his PISTOL into the dry dock.
C: KORDA
D: And your back up.
E: O.S.
N: Roper removes the PISTOL from his ankle HOLSTER, tossing it. Korda's VOICE cuts the eerie silence.
C: KORDA
D: Walk under the cranes and down the alleyway. At the end, turn right. Building thirty-six.
E: O.S. continuing
N: The RADIO CLICKS OFF. Roper walks towards the megalith CRANES, passing under them, then heads down the alleyway created by the tall buildings.
S: EXT. ROPER'S TRUCK - DAY LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK
N: McCall, his RIFLE CASE on his chest, watches as Roper turns the corner and heads down the alley way. OUTSIDE THE TRUCK McCall rolls out, scrambling for the cover of the building. Slinging the case over his shoulder he finds a LADDER leading up the side of the building, beginning to climb.
S: EXT. ROPER - DAY
N: Walking down the alley way, nearing the end.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY
N: McCall moving along the edge, looking down. He spots Roper, moving fast to keep him in sight. He comes to the edge of the building, having to walk across a narrow RAMP to get to the next building. He looks down, Roper turning the corner, McCall moves on, removing the RIFLE from its case as he goes.
S: EXT. ROPER - DAY
N: Leaves the alleyway, a complex of hanger-like buildings revealed. To his far right is a building, a SIGN reading: BLD 36. He clutches the satchel, heading towards it.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - BUILDING - DAY
N: McCall negotiating another precarious crossing between buildings. He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof tops and buildings for the sniper's position. He sees it, across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper is now walking. He heads out.
S: EXT. ROPER - DAY
N: Walking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the roof tops of the buildings around him.
C: ROPER
D: Where the hell are you, McCall?
E: to himself
N: As Roper passes a set of partially open ROLLING DOORS to the glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's VOICE from within:
C: KORDA
D: Right there, Roper.
E: O.S.
N: Roper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away.
C: ROPER
D: Shit.
N: Roper stops, slowly turning towards the doors.
C: KORDA
D: Come on in, there's someone just dying to see you.
E: O.S.
N: Roper hesitates. He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching.
C: ROPER
D: Where are you?
E: loudly
S: EXT. HIGH VANTAGE POINT - DAY
N: POV TELESCOPIC SIGHT: Focusing on Roper, his lips moving... McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the glass fronted building.
C: MCCALL
D: Right here, Scott.
N: He touches the LASER SIGHTING attachment to his scope, a red beam activated... ROPER - DAY From inside the building Korda's VOICE:
C: KORDA
D: Get your ass in here, Roper.
E: O.S.
N: Just as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind him. Roper moves inside. MCCALL - DAY Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE, looking through the scope. TELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the room cast in HARD SHADOWS. He MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now just inside.
C: MCCALL
D: Stay cool, real easy...
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge MACHINES, LATHES and EQUIPMENT once used in the design of nuclear submarines. Roper moves a few feet inside, remaining in the light and keeping his face in three-quarter profile to McCall's position.
C: ROPER
D: Where is she, Korda? I want to see her.
N: From the darkness beyond...
C: KORDA
D: Walk to the table.
N: Roper walks to a steel SHOP TABLE.
C: KORDA
D: Open your shirt.
E: O.S. continuing
C: ROPER
D: I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
C: KORDA
D: Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
E: O.S.
N: Roper puts down the satchel, unbuttoning his shirt, holding it open.
C: ROPER
D: Satisfied?
C: KORDA
D: Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
E: O.S.
N: Roper opens the bag, the JEWELRY and the dozens of GLASSINE ENVELOPES spill out onto the table. He lays the satchel on its side, the bottom facing Roper. Taped to the bottom is a short barreled .45 AUTOMATIC.
C: ROPER
D: It's all there.
C: KORDA
D: Spread it out.
E: O.S.
N: Roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table.
C: ROPER
D: Only the jewels, Korda, you've got my word.
N: A long beat...
C: KORDA
D: Show me something.
E: O.S.
N: Without looking Roper reaches to the pile of GLASSINE ENVELOPES... CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND Palmed in his hand, the ENVELOPE containing Ronnie's diamond. Roper, without looking, 'digs' into the pile, holding up the GLASSINE ENVELOPE between his fingers, still holding the palmed envelope. He starts to toss the envelope in his fingers...
C: KORDA
D: Not that one.
E: O.S. continuing
N: Roper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving over the pile...
C: ROPER
D: Right there, the one in front... yeah, that one. Toss it.
E: continuing
N: Roper reaches for the envelope. CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND As he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the skill of a card shark, exchanging it for the one Korda indicated. He tosses it across the room... From the shadows Korda's hand reaches out, picking it up. A long beat.
C: KORDA
D: I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
E: O.S. continuing
C: ROPER
D: Yeah.
C: KORDA
D: That's not going to look too good on your service record.
E: O.S. wry
C: ROPER
D: I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
N: Korda LAUGHS as he slowly emerges from the darkness.
C: KORDA
D: My sentiments exactly.
S: EXT. MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV - DAY
N: On the floor he SEES a shadow cast - Korda. He moves to the windows... inside the vague, blurred OUTLINE of a man. His scope goes back to the satchel and the .45 taped to the bottom.
C: MCCALL
D: Wait for the right moment, Scott...
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Korda moves closer to the light, tossing an ATHLETIC BAG to Roper, in his hand an AUTOMATIC PISTOL.
C: KORDA
D: Fill it up. Just in case there's a homing device in the other one.
N: Roper slides the jewels into the second bag, eyeing the .45 on the bottom of the satchel.
C: KORDA
D: Now bring it over here.
E: continuing
N: Roper hesitates, but all he can do at this point is play for time, he moves forward...
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY TELESCOPIC SCOPE
N: Watching Roper as he moves away from the satchel and the gun.
C: MCCALL
D: Oh, shit...
N: He moves the SCOPE ahead of Roper, SEEING Korda's shadow cast on the floor, still unable to see him.
C: MCCALL
D: All right, Scott, bring him out.
E: continuing
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Roper growing closer to Korda's position.
C: KORDA
D: That's far enough. Bag on the floor.
N: Roper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels' in there -- all he has to bargain with.
C: ROPER
D: I've kept my end. Ronnie first.
N: Korda reacts in mock surprise.
C: KORDA
D: Oh, shit, in all the excitement I almost forgot. She right here...
N: A LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming ON, illuminating a massive FLAT BED CIRCULAR LATHE. Roper's eyes in horror go to... RONNIE Tied to the lathe bed spread eagle. Some distance from her body a CUTTING DEVICE is positioned over the lathe bed. Roper looks into Ronnie's terrified eyes.
C: ROPER
D: Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you out of this.
N: He turns back, Korda grinning at him.
C: KORDA
D: No shit, this I gotta see...
N: Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held down with TAPE. Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN, very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade. (PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie. Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it. We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at this point.
C: KORDA
D: Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the switch. You see, you have to keep your finger on the button or the little lady gets cut...
E: continuing
N: He releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting device. He stops it again, holding the button.
C: KORDA
D: Right in half.
E: continuing; grins
N: He eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control box, holding the button down.
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
N: Through the SCOPE, he can see Korda as he steps into view. The CROSSHAIRS settle on Korda's upper forehead.
C: MCCALL
D: Hold it right there...
N: His finger tightens on the trigger...
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Korda holds the control box towards Roper.
C: KORDA
D: But then, that's not my problem.
N: He releases the button and the box, the lathe turning, Korda grinning at Roper...
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
N: The RED DOT centered on Korda's forehead...
C: MCCALL
D: Light's out, fucker...
E: O.S.
N: And then Roper's HEAD fills the scope, the red dot GLOWING on the back of his head. In shock, McCall releases his finger...
C: MCCALL
D: Jesus!
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Roper moving to the control box, pressing the stop button, stopping the lathe...
C: KORDA
D: You see, it's out of my hands.
N: Roper looks at the box, Ronnie's life literally in his hands... Sequence omitted from original script.
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
N: Through the SCOPE, Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda.
C: MCCALL
D: Roper, move...
S: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: But Korda bends down, picking up the BAG, stepping back away from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire.
C: KORDA
D: Well, hate to run but I've got a plane to catch. You take good care of the little lady, hear?
N: As Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop, we now SEE a CAR parked near the end facing us. Korda suddenly stops, turning, gesturing to the car.
C: KORDA
D: How careless of me. You see, there's only one way out of here, and you're standing right in the way. You could move, but then...
E: continuing grins
N: He shakes his head at Roper.
C: KORDA
D: Sure hate to be in your shoes.
E: continuing
N: He turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING, to himself. Roper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the .45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the button.
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
N: He can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else.
C: MCCALL
D: What the hell's going on?
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Now Korda reaches his car, hopping inside, STARTING it up. In desperation Roper looks back at the satchel, then turns, calling out...
C: ROPER
D: McCall, stop him, stop the car!
N: Korda REVVING the engine...
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
N: McCall reading Roper's lips...
C: MCCALL
D: What car?
N: He swings the SCOPE up but the back of the machine shop is blocked by his vantage point. Then he HEARS the faint SQUEALING of tires. He lowers his scope, holding, waiting...
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Korda at the end of the long building, beginning to accelerate. ROPER Turns toward McCall's position...
C: ROPER
D: McCall!
N: The CAR now screaming down the long corridor...
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
N: McCall still can't see the car...
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: The car now closing in on Roper, but Roper holds his ground...
C: ROPER
D: McCall, shoot the son of a bitch!
S: INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY
N: Korda bearing down on Roper.
C: KORDA
D: Bye, bye, cop...
N: ROPER Holding his position, eyes widening in fear...
S: EXT. MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV - DAY
N: The CAR comes into view, the CROSSHAIRS on the windshield... but the glare off the window is obscuring any shot of Korda. McCall takes aim and FIRES...
S: INT. KORDA'S CAR - DAY
N: The bullet punches through the window, catching Korda's left shoulder, BLOOD flying. Korda whips the wheel in shock...
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY KORDA'S CAR
N: Spinning out of control, hitting a table piled with MACHINE PARTS, sending them flying... But the car is now swapping ends, still flying right towards Roper, who can't move...; who won't move. The car flies past him, the SIDE MIRROR catching Roper's shirt, tearing it, a flash of BLOOD from his arm... The car then collides with a series of PIPES crossing the floor, STEAM erupting in every direction as the car then slams into several PROPANE BOTTLES stacked near the benches, a series of EXPLOSIONS ripping through the building. . . ROPER Thrown to the floor by the explosions, releasing the button, as... THE CAR Hits the GLASSED-IN ROLLING DOORS.
S: EXT. MCCALL'S POV - DAY
N: The CAR explodes from the building, GLASS FLYING, the car rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels, driver's side away from McCall's position.
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER
N: On the floor, recovering. He catches a quick glimpse of the bottom section of the lathe, a GEARBOX, the gears turning... THE LATHE Turning, the cutting blade inching towards Ronnie... ROPER Staggers to his feet, grabbing the control box, pressing the button... nothing happens, the lathe still turning, SPARKS coming out of the box, it's SHORTING... Only a few more seconds... Desperately his eyes search the floor, SEEING a HUGE WRENCH. He grabs the wrench, jamming it between the GEARS in the gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush the wrench... Roper runs to Ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds, the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her... THE GEARBOX Hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat longer... ROPER Pulls the last of the restraints away... THE GEARBOX Just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table turning... THE LATHE The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper hauls her away, holding her in his arms.
S: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL'S TELESCOPIC POV OF CAR
N: Korda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a DRAIN PIPE attached to the side of the building.
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: Roper holding Ronnie, easing her away from the still turning lathe.
C: RONNIE
D: Scottie, Scottie...
C: ROPER
D: It's all over, babe, it's all over.
S: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
N: McCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but... KORDA'S CAR Korda is not quite dead... The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall. He OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as BULLETS hit the wall around him. McCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE ensuing.
S: INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY ROPER
N: HEARING the shots outside, hauls Ronnie out of the way, keeping her low to the ground.
C: ROPER
D: Stay here, don't move.
C: RONNIE
D: Scottie...
C: ROPER
D: Do it!
N: He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the cavernous, machine-choked building.
S: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY MCCALL
N: FIRES a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car, runs from his cover into the opening... KORDA Leaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and runs alongside the machine shop. ROPER Exits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping to his side.
C: ROPER
D: McCall, you all right?
C: MCCALL
D: I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
E: in pain
C: ROPER
D: Stay put.
N: Roper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it, catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the other end. Roper charges on...
S: EXT. MACHINE SHOP - REAR - DAY
N: Korda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner of the next building. KORDA Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it, jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view. ROPER With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES, two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand. KORDA Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging on for dear life.
C: ROPER
D: Give it up, Korda, you got away with nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! It's all fake!
E: shouting
N: Korda can't help but look at the OPEN BAG beside him.
C: ROPER
D: Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! It's all shit! A hundred dollars worth of glass!
E: continuing
N: Korda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the COSTUME JEWELRY. He can't believe it, it's all fake!
C: KORDA
D: You fuck!!!
N: Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on. Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to avoid the obstacles. Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING, PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the cab... ROPER In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH. KORDA Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS hysterically... he knocked him off! ROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching the dry dock area. In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the 2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, pinning it to the floor. As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame, locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING wide open. Korda reacts in panic... Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK looming towards them. He prepares to jump... KORDA Suddenly SEES the approaching dry dock. He jams on the brakes, but it's not enough, the truck racing towards the edge... IN SLOW MOTION THE TRUCK Vaults over the edge of the dry dock as Roper runs down the bed, leaping off the tail gate, arms windmilling as he goes airborne... The truck plummets towards the bottom... ROPER Lands in a huge pile of CARGO NETS and CARDBOARD BOXES, piled near the edge of the dry dock... KORDA SCREAMS in wide-eyed terror as... THE TRUCK Hits the bottom of the dock, EXPLODING into flames.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. TAHITI - DAY
N: Roper and Ronnie lay on a gorgeous white sand beach, drinking from coconuts with umbrellas in them.
C: RONNIE
D: I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
C: ROPER
D: Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
N: Roper hails a waitress, serving the hotel guests.
C: ROPER
D: I'll have another Pena Colada. And this time could you shave the ice, please.
E: to waitress
C: WAITRESS
D: Oui, Monsieur. Right away.

C: RONNIE
D: Scottie?
C: ROPER
D: Hmm?

C: ROPER
D: Yeah.
E: sensing something's up
C: RONNIE
D: You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
N: Uh-oh. He removes his shades to get a better look at the curve ball.
C: RONNIE
D: I was just thinking... There's something special I want to talk to you about. I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship. A deeper level.
E: here it comes he's listening pointedly
C: ROPER
D: A deeper level?
E: no longer relaxed, sitting up
C: RONNIE
D: That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
C: ROPER
D: Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
E: cutting her off at the pass
C: RONNIE
D: Scott...
C: ROPER
D: I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
C: RONNIE
D: ...the hell are you talking about?

D: I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
C: RONNIE
D: I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
C: ROPER
D: You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?' Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
E: off her look
C: RONNIE
D: You thought I was talking about getting married?!
N: She laughs her amazing laugh.
C: RONNIE
D: I'm talking about taking our clothes off, silly. You said you would.
N: AD LIBS dialogue below as CAMERA CRANES BACK and we ROLL CREDITS over...
C: ROPER
D: You crazy? With all those people around?

C: RONNIE
D: Prude.
E: amused
C: ROPER
D: First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
N: Over her laughter we...
