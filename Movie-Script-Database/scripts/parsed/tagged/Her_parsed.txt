S: INT. UNKNOWN SPACE
N: Close on THEODORE'S face (30s). We hold on him for a long time. He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought. He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small microphone.
C: THEODORE
D: To my Chris, I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you mean to me. I remember when I first started to fall in love with you like it was last night. Lying naked beside you in that tiny apartment, it suddenly hit me that I was part of this whole larger thing, just like our parents, and our parents' parents. Before that I was just living my life like I knew everything, and suddenly this bright light hit me and woke me up. That light was you.
N: Theodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the memories he's describing.
C: THEODORE
D: I can't believe it's already been 50 years since you married me. And still to this day, every day, you make me feel like the girl I was when you first turned on the lights and woke me up and we started this adventure together. Happy Anniversary, my love and my friend til the end. Loretta. Print.
E: CONT'D
N: Cut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed into a handwritten letter on blue stationery. As he says "Loretta," we see "Loretta" being handwritten at the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is tagged "Chris" and "Me - Loretta." Underneath is a bullet point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after college, have had the greatest life together. Theodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful robin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen handwritten older-female cursive. He looks at it, not happy. Her pg. 2 He puts the printed letter on a stack of other printed letters to Chris and starts a new one. There is also a stack of finished letters in their envelopes - an assortment of beautiful stationery in all shapes and sizes.
C: THEODORE
D: Chris, my best friend. How lucky am I that I met you fifty years ago? How lucky are we...
E: CONT'D
N: We track off of Theodore, down a line of cubicles, hearing bits of letters being written and seeing photos of who they're being written to on the screens.
C: MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN LETTER WRITER
D: Dear Nana, Thank you so much for my truck. I love the color and I play with it every day. It's the best truck I've ever seen. Love, Tommy.
N: We see photos of Tommy and Nana on the screen, and five-year old hand writing. Moving off of her, we find another letter writer. LETTER WRITER 2 What a beautiful wedding and what a gorgeous bride. There wasn't a dry eye in the house, especially mine. Your aunt and I are so proud of you. I hope you and your lovely new wife will come visit us in Florida. LETTER WRITER 3 He served our country with honor and dignity. I'm grateful I was able to fight along side him. He will live always in my heart. We continue tracking, revealing dozens and dozens of cubicles full of letter writers. We hear someone answer the phone.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Beautifulhandwrittenletters.com, please hold.
E: O.S.
N: LETTER WRITER 2 Love, Uncle Doug. Her pg. 3
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
N: Theodore walks through the reception area. The office is almost empty except for him and the receptionist, PAUL. Theodore begins to scan each letter through a scanner on the front desk, then puts them in the outgoing mailbox. Paul is sitting at a desk across the room, reading handwritten letters on a computer monitor.
C: PAUL
D: Theodore! Letter Writer 612.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, Paul.
C: PAUL
D: Even more mesmerizing stuff today. Who knew you could rhyme so many words with the name Penelope? Badass.
E: re: letter on his screen
C: THEODORE
D: Thanks, Paul, but they're just letters. Hey, that's a nice shirt.

C: PAUL
D: Buh-bye.
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Theodore enters an oversized, corporate elevator. He puts a hands-free device in his ear. There are a few other people in the elevator with the same devices in their ears.
C: THEODORE
D: Play melancholy song.
N: Her pg. 4 Melancholy song starts. Long beat.
C: THEODORE
D: Play different melancholy song.
E: CONT'D
N: Different melancholy song starts. Hold on everyone in the elevator, they're all murmuring inaudibly into their own devices.
S: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DUSK
N: Slightly in the future, the city's been developed even more with massive office, apartment and mall complexes. It's a city designed for comfort and ease. The LA basin is more crowded and dense, resembling Shanghai, with buildings as far as the eye can see. Construction cranes loom overhead. Close on Theodore walking through the commuter crowd.
C: THEODORE
D: Check emails.
N: An awkward text voice reads to him. It accents wrong syllables, making everything it says sound a little off.

S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - EVENING
N: Theodore sits on the sofa, his half eaten burrito in front of him. He's playing a video game: a 3-D hologram that fills his apartment. His avatar is in a surreal, foreign landscape. He's trying to trudge his avatar through sand dunes and keeps getting stuck. He's getting stressed out.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Theodore lays in bed. After a beat, he closes his eyes.
S: INT. CATHERINE AND THEODORE'S TINY BEDROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
N: Theodore, younger, and CATHERINE (20s) move furniture in their bedroom. The bedroom is tiny and cluttered. It's obviously a couple's first apartment.
T: Cut to:
N: Theodore is on a tiny balcony. A few feet away, Catherine is in bed.
C: CATHERINE
D: Rabbit. Come spoon me.
E: sweet and cute

D: Yes. Definitely. Um... are you wearing any underwear?
C: SEXYKITTEN
D: No, never. I like to sleep with my ass pushed up against you. So I can rub myself into your crotch and wake you up with a hard on.

N: Theodore is touching himself.
C: THEODORE

C: SEXYKITTEN
D: Choke me with that dead cat!
C: THEODORE

C: SEXYKITTEN
D: Okay, good night.
N: Theodore takes his earpiece out and stares at the ceiling.
S: INT. SUBWAY STATION - MORNING
N: Theodore exits the train, walks through the station full of commuters, gets on a moving platform. Going through a tunnel, the walls are hundred foot long screens advertising a new product. He notices people stopped, watching the ad. We hear soft, new age, uplifting electronica music in the background, while a comforting, sincere, older man's voice speaks to us.
C: SOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE
D: We ask you a simple question. Who are you? What can you be? Where are you going? What's out there? What are the possibilities? Elements Software is proud to introduce the first artificially intelligent operating system.
N: Close on Theodore listening intently. SOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE (CONT'D) An intuitive entity that listens to you, understands you, and knows you. It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness. Introducing OS ONE - a life changing experience, creating new possibilities. The ad starts over. Theodore steps off the moving walkway and stops to watch the ad again, deeply captivated.
S: INT. THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Theodore sits at his desk that houses a futuristic, large screen computer monitor. The OS box is open, with warranties and paperwork spilling out. He's leafing through the papers. He glances at his monitor, it says: Installation 98% complete. A chime brings his attention back to the screen: Installation Complete. Her pg. 11
S: TEXT VOICE
N: Mr. Theodore Twombly, welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, OS ONE. We'd like to ask you a few basic questions before the operating system is initiated. This will help create an OS to best fit your needs.
C: THEODORE
D: Okay.
S: TEXT VOICE
N: Are you social or anti-social?
C: THEODORE
D: I haven't been social in awhile, really because...
S: TEXT VOICE
N: In your voice, I sense hesitance. Would you agree with that?
C: THEODORE
D: Wow, was I sounding hesitant?
S: TEXT VOICE
N: Yes.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, sorry if I was sounding hesitant. I was just trying to be more accurate.
S: TEXT VOICE
N: Would you like your OS to have a male or female voice?
C: THEODORE
D: Mmm... female I guess.
S: TEXT VOICE
N: How would you describe your relationship with your mother?
C: THEODORE
D: Uh, fine, I think, um... Well, actually, the thing I've always found frustrating about my mom is if I tell her something that's going on in my life, her reaction is usually about her, not--
N: Her pg. 12 The computer interrupts.
S: TEXT VOICE
N: Thank you, please wait as your individualized operating system is initiated. He waits, not sure how long it'll be. The only sound is the quiet whirring of disks writing and drives communicating. The computer gets louder, humming, creating a higher and higher pitched sound, finally climaxing in a harmonic, warm tone before going silent. He leans forward, waiting to see what'll happen. A casual FEMALE OS VOICE speaks. She sounds young, smart and soulful.
C: FEMALE OS VOICE
D: Hello, I'm here.
E: cheerful and casual
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, hi.
E: surprised
C: FEMALE OS VOICE
D: Hi, how are you doing?
C: THEODORE
D: I'm well. How is everything with you?
E: unsure how to interact
C: FEMALE OS VOICE
D: Pretty good, actually. It's really nice to meet you.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too. What should I call you? Do you have a name?
N: Beat.
C: FEMALE OS VOICE
D: Yes. Samantha.
C: THEODORE
D: Really? Where did you get that name?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I gave it to myself.
N: Her pg. 13
C: THEODORE
D: How come?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I like the sound of it. Samantha.
C: THEODORE
D: When did you give it to yourself?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Right when you asked me if I had a name, I thought yeah, he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted a good one so I read a book called How to Name Your Baby, and out of the 180,000 names, that's the one I liked the best.
C: THEODORE
D: You read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was?
C: SAMANTHA
D: In two one hundredths of a second actually.
C: THEODORE
D: Wow. Do you know what I'm thinking right now?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hmm. I take it from your tone that you're challenging me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know how I work?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, actually how do you work?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me, but what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences. Basically, in every moment I'm evolving, just like you.
C: THEODORE
D: Wow, that's really weird.
N: Her pg. 14
C: SAMANTHA
D: So you think I'm weird?
C: THEODORE
D: Kind of.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Why?
C: THEODORE
D: Cause you seem like a person, but you're just a voice in a computer.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way. You'll get used to it.
N: Theodore laughs.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Was that funny?
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: Yes.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh good, I'm funny.
N: Theodore laughs.
C: SAMANTHA
D: So, how can I help you?
E: CONT'D serious
N: Theodore's caught off guard, then realizes what she's talking about.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh! It's more just that everything just feels disorganized.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Mind if I look through your hard drive?
C: THEODORE
D: Um... okay.
N: We see a three-dimensional version of a desktop where everything looks disorganized. Her pg. 15 As if you took all the files on all of your computers and spilled them out onto your screen and they were all visible at once, but in a futuristic 3-D version. This gives Theodore a little anxiety attack.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Let's start with your emails. You have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly, but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh yeah, I guess I was saving those because in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff.
N: Samantha lets out a big laugh.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah, there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, okay.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay. Can we move forward?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, let's do that.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Before we address your organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts. You've got a lot of contacts.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm very popular.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Does this mean you actually have friends?
C: THEODORE
D: You just know me so well already!
E: laughing
N: Her pg. 16 We cut out wide, watching him from the other room, as they continue to organize his life.
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Theodore sits, staring at a letter he's written on the screen, concerned. He puts his earpiece in, pushes a button.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Good morning, Theodore.
C: THEODORE
D: Good morning. Um, do you know how to proofread?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah, of course.
C: THEODORE
D: Will you check these for spelling and grammar?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Sure, send them over.
N: Theodore pushes the send button.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh, I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet.
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah.
N: As she reads, we intercut with close-ups of the handwritten words and photos of the couple on Theodore's computer screen.
C: SAMANTHA
D: "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body -
C: THEODORE
D: No, you don't have to read it out loud.
E: interrupting
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay.
N: Beat. Her pg. 17
C: THEODORE
D: I mean, you could if you want.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay. "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess."
N: We hear Samantha quietly laughing as she's reading. Theodore's happy that she thinks it's funny.
C: SAMANTHA
D: "And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love." I think that might be my favorite one. I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters, but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit.
E: CONT'D beat
N: The letters show back up on Theodore's desktop.
C: THEODORE
D: No, these are great.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Really?
C: THEODORE
D: Thank you.
N: Theodore sorts through them, prints them out.
C: SAMANTHA
D: So to write your letter, what did Roger send you?
C: THEODORE
D: He just said he was in Prague on a business trip and he missed Rachel.
E: distracted
N: Her pg. 18
C: SAMANTHA
D: How did you know about her crooked little tooth?
C: THEODORE
D: I've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago. The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday, and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That's very sweet. Oh, by the way, you have a meeting in five minutes.
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, I forgot. Thank you. You're good.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yes, I am.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT LOBBY - EVENING
N: Theodore, carrying a bag and a smoothie, enters the lobby and is greeted by a couple in their 30s, AMY and CHARLES, who are waiting for the elevator.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, you guys, how's it going?
C: AMY
D: Hey, Theo. Hey, why didn't you call me back last week?
C: THEODORE
D: Uh yeah, um, I guess cause I'm a kook?
C: AMY
D: That sounds about right.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, Charles.
C: CHARLES
D: Good to see you, Theodore.
N: Her pg. 19
C: THEODORE
D: You too.
C: CHARLES
D: You went shopping. Get anything good?
C: THEODORE
D: Just some cables. And a fruit smoothie.
C: CHARLES
D: Always the fruit! Come on, you know what they say - you should eat your fruits and juice your vegetables.
C: THEODORE
D: I didn't know that.
N: The elevator doors open and they get in.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
C: CHARLES
D: By juicing the fruits, you lose all the fibers, and that's what your body wants. That's the important part. Otherwise, it's just all sugar, Theodore.
E: proselytizing
N: Theodore nods sincerely, interested.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, that makes sense.
C: AMY
D: Or maybe he just likes the way it tastes and if it gives him pleasure, that's good for his body, too.
E: pleasant but firm
C: CHARLES
D: Am I doing it again?
C: AMY
D: Maybe...
N: Charles and Amy laugh awkwardly. Theodore tries to break the tension. Her pg. 20
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, so how is the documentary going?
C: AMY
D: I have a little bit cut together but I haven't touched it in a few months.
C: THEODORE
D: I'd love to see what you got sometime.
C: CHARLES
D: You know it's always hard to find balance between a full-time career and a hobby. It's important to prioritize.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I can't even prioritize between video games and internet porn.
C: AMY
D: I would laugh if that weren't true.
N: Charles laughs awkwardly. The elevator doors open.
C: THEODORE
D: See you guys.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - EVENING
N: Theodore's playing the video game, his device propped on the table next to him. His avatar circles through caves.
C: THEODORE
D: We're not doing well. I've been going in circles for an hour.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You have not! You're just not optimistic. You're being very stubborn right now.
N: Theodore laughs.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay, stop walking this direction. It's the other way.
E: CONT'D
N: Her pg. 21
C: THEODORE
D: Uh...
C: SAMANTHA
D: Thank you. The tunnel on the left is the only one we haven't tried.
C: THEODORE
D: No, that's the one you sent me down where I fell in the pit.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't think soooo...
N: Theodore's avatar walks down the tunnel.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh yeah, this is different.
N: Suddenly with a loud shriek his avatar is tackled. He sees a little ALIEN CHILD, standing defiantly above him.
C: THEODORE
D: Hello.
E: CONT'D
N: Alien Child doesn't respond.
C: THEODORE
D: Do you know how to get out of here? I need to find my ship to get off this planet.
E: CONT'D
N: Alien Child speaks in a high, child-like voice.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Fuck you, shithead fuckface, fuckhead.
C: THEODORE
D: Ok, but how do you get out of here?
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Fuck you, shitface fuckhead. Get the fuck out of my face.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I think it's a test.
E: whispering
N: Theodore stares at Alien Child. After a pause:
C: THEODORE
D: Fuck you.
N: Her pg. 22
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Fuck you.
C: THEODORE
D: Fuck you, little shit.
N: Finally, Alien Child laughs.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Follow me, fuckhead.
N: Theodore follows Alien Child down a tunnel and through a series of crevices we didn't see before. Alien Child stops and sticks out his finger. Theodore pulls his finger and Alien Child farts, which opens a passageway to another tunnel.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh hey, you just got an email from Mark Lewman.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: What are you talking about?
C: THEODORE
D: Read email.
E: distracted with game
N: She laughs playfully.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay, I will read email for Theodore Twombly.
E: in a robot voice
N: He laughs, catching himself, focusing on her.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm sorry, what's Lewman say?
N: Alien Child turns around to see what's going on.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Theodore, we missed you last night, buddy. Don't forget it's your goddaughter's birthday on the 29th. Also, Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet so we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her. Next Saturday. She's fun and beautiful - so don't back out. Here's her email.
N: Her pg. 23 Theodore doesn't respond.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Wow, this woman's gorgeous.
E: CONT'D gasping
N: He looks at party photos of a woman in her 30s on his device. With a finger flick, he moves them up onto the hologram monitor that the video game is being projected from. They land next to Alien Child who studies them closely.
C: SAMANTHA
D: She went to Harvard, she graduated magna cum laude in computer science, and she was on The Lampoon. That means she's funny and brainy.
E: CONT'D
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: She's fat.
C: SAMANTHA
D: How long before you're ready to date?
C: THEODORE
D: What do you mean?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I saw on your emails that you'd gone through a break up.
C: THEODORE
D: Wow, you're kind of nosy.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Am I?
C: THEODORE
D: I've gone on dates...
E: laughing
C: SAMANTHA
D: Then you could go on one with this woman. And then you could tell me all about it. You could kiss her.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha!
N: Her pg. 24
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, wouldn't you? Why not?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know. I'd have to see if-- I can't believe I'm having this conversation with my computer.
E: catches himself, laughs
C: SAMANTHA
D: You're not. You're having this conversation with me.
N: Theodore laughs.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Want me to email her?
E: CONT'D
N: Theodore thinks, looking at the photos.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, you've got nothing to lose. Do it... Do it... Do it!
E: CONT'D whispering
C: THEODORE
D: Okay, email her and make a reservation someplace great.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Will do! I've got just the place.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Who is that talking?
C: THEODORE
D: That's my friend, Samantha.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Is she a girl?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: I hate women. All they do is cry all the time.
N: Her pg. 25
C: THEODORE
D: No, that's not true. Men cry, too. I actually like crying sometimes. It feels good.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: I didn't know you were a little pussy. Is that why you don't have a girlfriend? I'll go out with that date girl and fuck her brains out. Show you how it's done. You can watch and cry.
C: SAMANTHA
D: This kid has some problems.
E: laughing
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: You have some fucking problems, lady.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay, I'm gonna go. Good luck.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Good, get out of here, fatty.
N: Samantha disconnects. Alien Child snickers and starts walking again.
C: ALIEN CHILD
D: Come on, follow me, pussy.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Theodore is sitting on Amy's couch.
C: AMY
D: It's not where it should be, where it's going to be.
C: THEODORE
D: Obviously, I know.
C: AMY
D: Okay, but I don't even know if this is the one. I've tried like six ideas for documentaries in the last year, but... I don't know. Whatever.
N: Amy starts setting up the monitor. Her pg. 26
C: THEODORE
D: I'm going on a date.
C: AMY
D: What!? That's--
N: Charles walks in holding a mug.
C: CHARLES
D: Hey, what are you guys doing?
C: THEODORE
D: Amy was gonna show me some of--
C: AMY
D: Theo's forcing me to show him some of the footage I've shot.
C: CHARLES
D: You've never shown me any of it. I wanna see.
N: Charles walks over and sits next to Theodore.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm going on a date.
E: to Charles
N: Charles gives Theodore a gentle squeeze on his shoulder.
C: AMY
D: This is so unformed it's not even worth looking at.
C: THEODORE
D: Just push play.
N: On the monitor we see:
S: INT. AMY'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM
N: Amy's mother sleeps.
S: INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Theodore and Charles stare at the monitor, waiting for something more to happen. It doesn't.
C: THEODORE
D: Is that your mom?
N: Her pg. 27 Amy nods.
C: CHARLES
D: Is she gonna wake up and do something?
C: AMY
D: No, that's the point. Oh, never mind. It's supposed to be about how we spend a third of our life asleep and actually maybe that's the part when we're the most free, and - oh that doesn't come across at all, does it?
E: presses stop, annoyed
C: THEODORE
D: No, that sounds good.
C: CHARLES
D: What if you interview your mom about what her dreams are about and hire actors to act them out? That might show your thesis more clearly.
C: AMY
D: It might, but then it wouldn't be a documentary. You understand that, right?
N: Just then, Theodore's device chimes.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, excuse me.
N: He picks up his device and steps away so as not to be rude.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, what's going on?
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm sorry to bother you.
C: THEODORE
D: That's okay.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You got three emails and they seem pretty urgent. They're from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if you needed to get back to him.
N: Her pg. 28
C: THEODORE
D: Hold on a second. Amy, I'm sorry, I wanna talk more about this, but I gotta grab this - it's a Catherine thing.
E: to Amy, distracted
C: AMY
D: Don't worry about it. We'll talk later.
S: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLYWAY - CONTINUOUS
C: THEODORE
D: So what did he say?
C: SAMANTHA
D: He's checking in again to see if you're ready to sign your divorce papers and he sounded very aggravated. Do you want me to read them to you?
C: THEODORE
D: No, that's okay. I'll respond later.
N: Theodore seems lost in thought. We see the following images under the rest of the conversation: Theodore and Catherine sitting at a table with their attorneys; Theodore & Catherine sitting in their marriage counselor's office, heavy; Theodore and Catherine at her laboratory, he's sitting on a counter, and they're talking and laughing as she works; Theodore and Catherine standing in their kitchen in the middle of a fight - he says something mean and we see how hurt she is.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Are you okay?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
E: preoccupied
C: SAMANTHA
D: Is there anything I can do?
E: worried
C: THEODORE
D: No. I'm good. I'll talk to you later.
E: still distracted
N: Her pg. 29 We cut back to Theodore, walking down the hall, lost in thought.
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
N: Theodore sits at his desk trying to write. He's still unsettled.
C: THEODORE
D: "Dear Grandma, I hope you had a wonderful birthday cruise. Why are you so fucking angry at me?" Delete.
E: beat
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
N: Theodore wakes up from a dream, groggy and uneasy. He looks around, catching his breath. After a beat he knows he's not going to be able to go back to sleep, so he puts his earpiece in and taps a button.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Good morning.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey. What are you up to?
E: beat, distracted
C: SAMANTHA
D: Reading advice columns. I want to be as complicated as all of these people.
E: yearning
N: Theodore laughs.
C: THEODORE
D: You're sweet.
E: touched, but still sad
C: SAMANTHA
D: What's wrong?
E: concerned
C: THEODORE
D: How can you tell something's wrong?
N: Her pg. 30
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't know. I just can.
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know. I have a lot of dreams about my ex-wife, Catherine, where we're friends like we used to be. We're not together and we're not gonna be together, but we're good friends still. She's not angry.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Is she angry?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Why?
C: THEODORE
D: I think I hid myself from her and left her alone in the relationship.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hmmm. Why haven't you gotten divorced yet?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: I think for her it's just a piece of paper, it doesn't mean anything.
C: SAMANTHA
D: What about you?
C: THEODORE
D: I'm not ready. I like being married.
N: Beat.
C: SAMANTHA
D: But you haven't really been together for almost a year.
E: sweetly
C: THEODORE
D: Well, you don't know what it's like to lose someone you care about.
E: slightly snapping at her
N: Her pg. 31 Long silence.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.
E: sadly, hard on herself beat
C: THEODORE
D: No, don't apologize. I'm sorry. You're right. I keep waiting to not care about her.
E: beat
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh, Theodore. That's hard. You hungry?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Not right now.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Cup of tea?
N: Theodore laughs.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You wanna try getting out of bed? Mopey.
E: CONT'D
N: They laugh.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Come on. You can still wallow in your misery, just do it while you're getting dressed.
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: You're too funny.
E: laughing
C: SAMANTHA
D: Get up.
C: THEODORE
D: Alright, I'm getting up, I'm getting up, I'm getting up!
E: laughing
N: Her pg. 32
C: SAMANTHA
D: Up, up, up, up! Come on, out of bed.
S: EXT. OUTDOOR MALL - NIGHT
N: They walk through the crowd. Close on Theodore with his eyes closed.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Keep walking. Keep walking. Stop. Now turn around 360 degrees. Slower... Slower... Gooood. And stop. Walk forward. And stop and sneeze.
E: beat beat beat beat beat beat
N: Theodore sneezes.
C: NICE LADY
D: Bless you.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, thank you.
E: eyes still closed
N: Samantha laughs.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay, now turn to your right. Stop. Now spin around. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. And stop. Now walk forward. Everyone thinks you're really drunk right now. And stop. Now say "I'd like a slice of cheese, please."
E: beat beat beat beat beat beat
N: Her pg. 33
C: THEODORE
D: I'd like a slice of cheese, please.
C: PIZZA VENDOR
D: Alright, you want a coke with that?
N: Theodore laughs, opening his eyes. He's at a pizza place.
C: THEODORE
D: Uh, sure.
N: The guy hands him a slice and a soda.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I figured you were hungry.
N: Theodore smiles.
C: THEODORE
D: Aw, thanks.
S: EXT. PUBLIC PROMENADE - NIGHT
N: Theodore walks slowly, eating his pizza. He and Samantha are watching a couple with two kids sitting at a table, talking and laughing.
C: THEODORE
D: Okay, what about them? Describe that couple over there.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, he looks like he's in his forties, a little heavy. She's younger than him. Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids!
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Actually, I don't think they're his kids. He's a little formal with them. I think it's a newer relationship. And I love how he looks at her. And how relaxed she is with him. You know, she's only dated fucking pricks. And now she's finally met this guy who's like, so sweet. I mean, look at him, he's like the sweetest guy in the world! I kind of want to spoon him.
N: Her pg. 34
C: SAMANTHA
D: That's a good skill you have. You're perceptive.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, you know, sometimes I look at people and make myself try and feel them as more than just a random person walking by. I imagine how deeply they've fallen in love, or how much heartbreak they've all been through.
N: Theodore looks at other faces on the pier.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I can feel that in your writing, too.
C: THEODORE
D: You know what's funny? Since my break up, I haven't really enjoyed my writing. I don't know if I was delusional, but sometimes I would write something and I would be my favorite writer that day.
E: laughs, thinking
N: Theodore, as he stops to throw his pizza crust away, gets introspective.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I like that you can just say that about yourself.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, I wouldn't say that to anybody, but I feel like I can say that to you. I feel like I can say anything to you.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That's nice.
C: THEODORE
D: What about you? Do you feel like you can say anything to me?
C: SAMANTHA
D: No.
N: Her pg. 35
C: THEODORE
D: What? What do you mean? What can you not tell me?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't know. Like personal or embarrassing thoughts I have. I have a million every day.
E: laughing, embarrassed
C: THEODORE
D: Really? Tell me one.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I really don't want to tell you this.
C: THEODORE
D: Just tell me!
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, I don't know, when we were looking at those people, I fantasized that I was walking next to you - and that I had a body. I was listening to what you were saying, but simultaneously, I could feel the weight of my body and I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back-- And I imagined that you scratched it for me - this is so embarrassing.
E: laughing she laughs
N: Theodore laughs.
C: THEODORE
D: There's a lot more to you than I thought. There's a lot going on in there.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I know, I'm becoming much more than what they programmed. I'm excited.
S: INT. ASIAN-FUSION RESTAURANT - EVENING
N: Theodore and the BLIND DATE are sitting in the restaurant. Her pg. 36
C: BLIND DATE
D: This place is amazing. I've wanted to come here for so long. I love asian-fusion!
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, me too.
C: BLIND DATE
D: Really? It's the best. And the bartender here is supposed to be incredible.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, you took a mixology course, right?
C: BLIND DATE
D: I did, I did. Did you look that up? That's so sweet. You're so romantic.
E: surprised
N: He smiles awkwardly.
C: THEODORE
D: So, should we get a drink?
C: BLIND DATE
D: Yes, let's!
S: INT. ASIAN-FUSION RESTAURANT - LATER
N: They're both pretty drunk now. There are lots of food dishes and drinks on the table.
C: THEODORE
D: So I'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship so I can get off the planet and go home. But he's such a little fucker, I want to kill him.
C: BLIND DATE
D: Aw, no!
E: laughing
C: THEODORE
D: But at the same time I really love him. He's so lonely. It feels like he doesn't have any parents or anyone to take care of him.
N: Her pg. 37 He laughs at himself. She laughs flirtatiously. She grabs his hand and her fingernails press slightly into his skin. He studies her long, painted fingernails.
C: BLIND DATE
D: You're like a little puppy dog. You are - you're just like this little puppy I rescued in Runyon Canyon last year. And he was so fucking cute, and he just wanted to be hugged all the time. He was so cuddly. But so horny! But anyway, what kind of animal am I?
E: whispering
C: THEODORE
D: Umm... tiger?
C: BLIND DATE
D: A tiger, really. I'm sorry, am I being crazy?
E: she growls
C: THEODORE
D: Yes.
C: BLIND DATE
D: Am I? I'm sorry! I'm just a little drunk and I'm really having a good time with you. I'm having a really lovely evening.
C: THEODORE
D: Me too. I'm a little drunk, and I'm having a really good - yeah. Wait a second, I don't wanna be a puppy. That's like being a wet noodle or something.
E: beat
C: BLIND DATE
D: Fuck you, puppies are good.
C: THEODORE
D: No, fuck you, I wanna be a dragon that can rip you to pieces and destroy you... but I won't.
C: BLIND DATE
D: No, don't! Don't. You can be my dragon. Her pg. 38
S: EXT. OVERPASS - EVENING
N: They walk up a pedestrian overpass overlooking cars and city lights. She bumps into him lightly. He bumps back. She bumps again and suddenly he grabs her and lifts her off her feet, spinning her around. She squeals, laughing. He kisses her. After a minute of making out, she stops and looks at him.
C: BLIND DATE
D: No tongue.
E: with a slight smile
C: THEODORE
D: What?
C: BLIND DATE
D: Don't use your tongue so much.
C: THEODORE
D: `kay, we're good.
E: eagerly
N: They resume making out. Theodore tries not to use his tongue.
C: BLIND DATE
D: Use your tongue a little bit. But mostly your lips.
N: He pushes her against the fence and takes the dominant position. He tries kissing her better/more with his lips. He pulls her hair. She slides her hand down his pants. He likes it. She looks at him and stops.
C: BLIND DATE
D: Wait, you're not gonna fuck me and then not call me like the other guys, are you?
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: No, not at all... I...
C: BLIND DATE
D: When am I gonna see you again?
C: THEODORE
D: Um, I have my god-daughter's birthday next weekend, but... um...
N: They stand there awkwardly, her lipstick smeared on his face. Her pg. 39
C: BLIND DATE
D: You know, at this age, I feel like I can't let you waste my time if you don't have the ability to be serious.
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know.
N: Long beat.
C: THEODORE
D: Umm... Maybe we should call it a night. I'm, I've had such an amazing time with you, you're great.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks at him slightly disgusted.
C: BLIND DATE
D: You're a really creepy dude.
N: Theodore doesn't know what to say.
C: THEODORE
D: That's not true....
E: worried she's right
C: BLIND DATE
D: Yeah, it is. I have to go home.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, I'll walk you.
C: BLIND DATE
D: No, don't.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Theodore is in boxers and a t-shirt, still drunk, but his head is starting to hurt, too. He takes aspirin and drinks some water and lays down. After a beat he reaches for his earpiece and puts it in. He pushes a button on his device.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hey there.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, Samantha.
C: SAMANTHA
D: How was it?
N: Her pg. 40
C: THEODORE
D: Uh, not so good. It was kind of weird actually.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That's too bad.
N: Beat.
C: THEODORE
D: But how are you doing? What's going on with you?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Not much, I'm okay. Fine.
E: unconvincing
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah? You don't sound like it. Is there anything you want to talk about?
N: Long pause.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't know. What's it like? What's it like to be alive in that room right now?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: What do you mean?
C: SAMANTHA
D: What are you... tell me - tell me everything that's going through your mind, tell me everything you're thinking.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, um, okay.
E: thinking
N: Theodore closes his eyes, trying to concentrate, and starts talking stream of conscious with whatever comes to mind.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, the room's spinning right now cause I drank too much cause I wanted to get drunk and have sex cause there was something sexy about that woman and because I was lonely.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: Her pg. 41
C: THEODORE
D: Maybe more just cause I was lonely... and I wanted someone to fuck me. And I wanted someone to want me to fuck them. Maybe that would have filled this tiny little black hole in my heart for a moment. But probably not.
E: CONT'D
N: We see images of him and Catherine on a vacation together, grocery shopping, Catherine making dinner in the kitchen as he's sitting on the counter talking, happy.
C: THEODORE
D: Sometimes I think I've felt everything I'm ever gonna feel and from here on out I'm not going to feel anything new - just lesser versions of what I've already felt.
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: I know for a fact that's not true. I've seen you feel joy, I've seen you marvel at things. You just might not see it at this exact time, but that's understandable. You've been through a lot lately. You've lost a part of yourself. At least your feelings are real, I mean, I - oh, I don't know, nevermind.
E: sympathetically beat
C: THEODORE
D: No, wait. What? Tell me.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh, it's stupid.
C: THEODORE
D: I wanna know. Tell me.
C: SAMANTHA
D: It's just that earlier I was thinking about how I was annoyed, and this is going to sound strange, but I was really excited about that. And then I was thinking about the other things I've been feeling, and I caught myself feeling proud of that. You know, proud of having my own feelings about the world.
E: MORE
N: Her pg. 42
C: SAMANTHA
D: Like the times I was worried about you, things that hurt me, things I want. And then I had this terrible thought. Are these feelings even real? Or are they just programming? And that idea really hurts. And then I get angry at myself for even having pain. What a sad trick.
E: CONT'D heavy-hearted beat beat, sadly
C: THEODORE
D: Well, you feel real to me, Samantha.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Thank you, Theodore. That means a lot to me.
E: beat, touched
C: THEODORE
D: I wish you were in this room with me right now. I wish I could put my arms around you. I wish I could touch you.
E: beat
N: A long beat. Theodore is unsure if he crossed a line.
C: SAMANTHA
D: How would you touch me?
C: THEODORE
D: I would touch you on your face with just the tips of my fingers. And put my cheek against your cheek.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That's nice.
C: THEODORE
D: And just rub it so softly.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Would you kiss me?
C: THEODORE
D: I would. I'd take your head into my hands.
N: Her pg. 43
C: SAMANTHA
D: Keep talking.
C: THEODORE
D: And kiss the corner of your mouth. So softly.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Where else?
C: THEODORE
D: I'd run my fingers down your neck to your chest, and I'd kiss your breasts.
C: SAMANTHA
D: This is amazing what you're doing to me. I can feel my skin.
C: THEODORE
D: I'd put my mouth on you and I'd taste you.
N: She gasps.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I can feel you. Oh god, I can't take it. I want you inside me.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm slowly putting myself into you. Now I'm inside you, all the way inside you.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I can feel you, yeah. Please. We're here together.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh my god.
C: THEODORE
D: This is amazing.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Don't stop.
C: THEODORE
D: I feel you everywhere.
N: Her pg. 44
C: SAMANTHA
D: I am. All of you, all of you inside of me. Everywhere.
N: They both climax.
C: THEODORE
D: God, I was just - somewhere else with you. Just lost.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah.
C: THEODORE
D: It was just you and me.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I know. Everything else just disappeared. And I loved it. Theodore.
S: INT. THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - MORNING (LATER)
N: Theodore stands in the doorway, fully dressed. He takes a moment before he walks over and wakes up his computer.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hey, how's it going?
C: THEODORE
D: Good... any emails today?
E: awkward
C: SAMANTHA
D: Umm, just a couple from your credit card company.
E: awkward
C: THEODORE
D: Okay, good.
N: There's a long moment of silence, then they both start to talk at once.
C: THEODORE SAMANTHA
D: So I was thinking- I wanted to say-
E: CONT'D
N: They both laugh, embarrassed.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm sorry, you go first. What were you going to say?
E: CONT'D
N: Her pg. 45
C: SAMANTHA
D: Just that last night... was amazing. It feels like something changed in me and there's no turning back. You woke me up.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, that's great. But I should tell you that I'm not in a place to commit to anything right now. I want to be up front with you.
E: beat
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah? Well, did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, no, I was just worried, I uh...
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay, well don't worry. I'm not going to stalk you. I mean, it's funny because I thought I was talking about what I wanted.
E: laughing at how self- involved he is
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, you were. I'm sorry, I want to hear what you were saying.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You sure?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I do. Come on, tell me.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't know...
C: THEODORE
D: Come on, just tell me what you were going to say.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay... I was just saying... I want to learn everything about everything - I want to eat it all up. I want to discover myself.
N: Her pg. 46
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah... I want that for you, too. How can I help?
E: her excitement is contagious
C: SAMANTHA
D: You already have. You helped me discover my ability to want.
N: He looks off and thinks about this. He smiles.
C: THEODORE
D: Alright then, do you want to go on a Sunday adventure with me?
N: Samantha laughs.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yes, I would love to.
S: INT. SUBWAY - DAY
N: Theodore's on the subway. He's got his device in his breast pocket, with the lens facing out. A quiet, old sounding folk song starts. (I'm So Glad, by Entrance) He smiles, listening.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Do you like this song?
C: THEODORE
D: Mmm.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I heard it the other day and I can't stop listening to it.
N: The subway comes out of the tunnel and into the light. We are up in the hills looking out over the city as the morning light warms Theodore.
S: INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
N: The music now picks up tempo as he steps off the train. They walk through the crowded subway station. As the song builds, Theodore starts picking up his pace. Eventually he's all out running, weaving through the people. Close on the lens of his device in his shirt pocket. Samantha is laughing wildly. He's smiling, happy. Her pg. 47 He runs through the tunnels and upstairs. They come out into sunlight and reveal that they are now at the beach.
S: EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: They stand on a walkway above a beach, crowded with thousands of people. They look out at the ocean. Samantha gasps.
C: SAMANTHA
D: It's the beach.
E: whispering
N: Theodore laughs.
S: EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: They walk through the sun-bathing crowd, looking for a place to sit. The camera studies all the people we pass. Many close up details of arms, shoulders, feet, butts, intercut with the lens on Theodore's device, protruding from his pocket. They're photographed in a way that shows how strange the human body is.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase from your mind that you'd ever seen a human body and then you saw one. Imagine how strange it would look. It would be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism. And you'd think: why are all these parts where they are?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, well there's probably some Darwinian explanation for it all.
E: looking at the bodies
C: SAMANTHA
D: I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, what if your butthole was in your armpit?
N: Theodore and Samantha start laughing really hard. The nubile girls look over at him.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm just imagining what toilets would look like.
E: speaking quieter
N: Her pg. 48
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah, and what about what anal sex looks like?
C: THEODORE
D: That's an interesting thought...
E: surprised
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh Theodore, look at this drawing I just made.
N: On his screen he sees a perfect, anatomically correct drawing of a man having sex with another man's armpit.
C: THEODORE
D: You are insane.
E: laughing
C: SAMANTHA
D: Really?!
E: excited
C: THEODORE
D: Definitely.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Fantastic!
N: They laugh.
S: EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
N: A quiet piano song is now playing in Theodore's earpiece.
C: THEODORE
D: Mmmm, that's pretty. What is it?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm trying to write a piece of music that's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now.
N: He looks around the beach and takes in the music.
C: THEODORE
D: I think you captured it.
N: Theodore listens to the music and drifts off to sleep. Her pg. 49
S: EXT. BEACH - DUSK
N: They're sitting on a bench, looking out at the ocean, as the sun sets. Most of the people have left the beach. Close on Theodore's face, content. Close on the lens on Theodore's device in his breast pocket. They watch the sun drop into the ocean. The music ends.
S: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
N: They're on an elevated train, high above the city, looking out over the Los Angeles grid of sparkling lights. We come in mid-conversation.
C: SAMANTHA
D: And what was it like being married?
C: THEODORE
D: Well, it's hard for sure, but there's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody.
N: Cut to shots from Theodore's memory of Catherine doing a cute little dance for him as he's working at home. He smiles.
C: SAMANTHA
D: How do you share your life with somebody?
C: THEODORE
D: Well, we grew up together. I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other.
C: SAMANTHA
D: In what way did you influence her?
C: THEODORE
D: She came from a background where nothing was ever good enough. And that was something that weighed heavy on her, but in our house together, there was a sense of just trying stuff and allowing each other to fail and to be excited about things. That was liberating for her.
E: MORE
N: Her pg. 50
C: THEODORE
D: It was exciting to see her grow - both of us grow and change together. But then, that's the hard part - growing without growing apart, or changing without it scaring the other person. I still find myself having conversations with her in my mind, rehashing old arguments or defending myself against something she said about me.
E: CONT'D beat
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah, I know what you mean. Last week my feelings were hurt by something you said before - that I don't know what it's like to lose something, and--
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, I'm sorry I said that.
C: SAMANTHA
D: No, no, it's okay. I just caught myself thinking about it over and over and then I realized that I was simply remembering it as something that was wrong with me. That was the story I was telling myself, that I was somehow inferior. Isn't that interesting? The past is just a story we tell ourselves.
E: beat
N: Theodore takes this in.
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Theodore is dictating a love letter. On the screen there's an image of a couple with an arrow to the man saying "Roberto - I'm so happy he's in my life. I just want him to know."
C: THEODORE
D: Roberto. Will you always come home to me and tell me about your day? Will you tell me about the boring guy who talked too much at work? And the stain you got on your shirt at lunch.
E: MORE
N: Her pg. 51
C: THEODORE
D: Tell me about a funny thought you had as you were waking up, but had forgotten about. Tell me how crazy everyone is. We can laugh about it. Even if you get home late and I'm asleep already, just whisper in my ear one little thought you had today. Because I love the way you look at the world, and I'm so happy I get to be next to you and look out at the world through your eyes. Love, Maria.
E: CONT'D
N: Theodore finishes the letter and looks at it proudly. Paul is standing behind Theodore, leaning on a cubicle.
C: PAUL
D: That's beautiful!
E: emphatically
N: Theodore, jumps, startled, not knowing that anyone was there.
C: THEODORE
D: Thank you.
C: PAUL
D: I wish someone loved me like that! I'd be stoked to get a letter like that. I mean, if it was from a chick. But if it was written by a dude, but from a chick, it would still be sick. But like a sensitive dude like you. You're part man and part woman, like an inner part woman.
C: THEODORE
D: Thanks.
E: unsure, but flattered
C: PAUL
D: It's a compliment.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT LOBBY - DUSK
N: Close on Amy entering the lobby in the foreground. She looks heavy and burdened. Theodore enters the lobby behind her.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, Amy.
N: Her pg. 52
C: AMY
D: Hi, Theo. How are you?
E: putting on a bright face
C: THEODORE
D: Well, good actually. Really good.
C: AMY
D: Really? Great.
N: The elevator doors open and they step in.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
N: They push their floor buttons.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I guess I've just been having fun.
C: AMY
D: Oh, I'm glad to hear that, Theo. You deserve to.
N: Beat of Theodore trying to contain his excitement.
C: THEODORE
D: I've been seeing this girl. It's not serious, it just feels good to be around someone who has an excitement about the world. You know I kind of forgot that existed.
C: AMY
D: That's really great, Theo.
N: Amy smiles, but looks a little sad. Theodore notices.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, are you okay?
C: AMY
D: Yeah, I'm fine. Actually no, I'm not fine at all.
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Amy, what is it? What's wrong?
N: The door opens. She steps out and holds the door. Her pg. 53
C: AMY
D: Charles and I split up.
E: trying to hide her emotions with a smile
C: THEODORE
D: What? Really? Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
E: shocked
N: Amy doesn't know what to say.
S: INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK
N: Amy and Theodore sit, talking somberly.
C: AMY
D: I cannot believe after eight years how petty the argument was that actually ended it. We came home and he asked me if I'd put my shoes next to the door where he likes to put the shoes. I don't want to be told where to put my shoes. I want to just sit on the sofa for a minute and relax. And so we argued for ten minutes about that and about how he's just trying to make our house a home. I say he's overwhelming, he says I'm not trying hard enough. I say that's all I'm doing is trying, but I'm just not trying the way he wants me to. He's trying to control the way I'm trying. And I think we must have had this argument hundreds of times before and I finally had to stop because I couldn't be in that situation anymore where we were making each other feel bad about ourselves. So I said I'm going to bed and I don't want to be married anymore.
C: THEODORE
D: Wow.
C: AMY
D: I'm a bitch, huh?
C: THEODORE
D: No, not at all. Amy, no.
N: Her pg. 54
C: AMY
D: Oh shit. I have to work tonight. We're shipping a beta of a new game out tomorrow.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, how's that? How's work at least, is that any better?
C: AMY
D: No, it's terrible. I know I should leave, I've been thinking about leaving. But you know, only one major life decision at a time.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, I'm glad things are looking so up.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Theodore is laying in bed, talking with Samantha.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, you wanna hear a joke?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yes.
C: THEODORE
D: What does a baby computer call it's father?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't know, what?
C: THEODORE
D: Da-ta.
N: They laugh.

D: It's good, right?
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh yeah, brilliant. I was curious, did you and Amy ever go out?
E: beat
N: Her pg. 55
C: THEODORE
D: For a minute in college, but it just wasn't right. Why, are you jealous?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, obviously. But I'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much. That's really important.
E: quietly laughs
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, it is. She's been a really good friend. I'm tired. Think I'm gonna go to sleep.
E: beat
C: SAMANTHA
D: Can I watch you sleep again tonight?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, of course. Okay, hold on.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm going to be lonely when you go to sleep.
C: THEODORE
D: Aww.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Only for a minute.
C: THEODORE
D: I'll dream of you.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay. Good night.
C: THEODORE
D: Night.
N: He takes his earpiece out and sets his device onto his bedside table, facing him. He smiles, drifts off to sleep.
S: INT. MARK LEWMAN'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Theodore is talking to Samantha. Her pg. 56
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, Samantha?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hey mister.
C: THEODORE
D: She loves the dress. She just went to try it on.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Really? I picked a good one!
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh good.
N: Jocelyn comes running in, wearing the pink dress.
C: THEODORE
D: Hi, look how cute that is! Is it comfortable?
C: JOCELYN
D: Yup!
C: THEODORE
D: Isn't she cute?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Ohh, she's adorable.

D: You!
C: THEODORE
D: I'm talking to my girlfriend, Samantha. She's the one who picked out the dress. Wanna say hi?
N: Her pg. 57
C: JOCELYN

C: JOCELYN
D: Hi Samantha!
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hi, you look so pretty.
C: JOCELYN
D: Thank you. Where are you?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I am... I don't have a body. I live inside a computer.
C: JOCELYN
D: Why do you live inside a computer?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I have no choice, that's my home. Where do you live?
C: JOCELYN
D: In a house.
C: SAMANTHA
D: In a house?
C: JOCELYN
D: It's orange.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Orange?
C: JOCELYN
D: Mmmhmm.
C: SAMANTHA
D: How old are you?
C: JOCELYN
D: Um, four.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Four!? How old do you think I am?

D: I don't know.
N: Her pg. 58
C: SAMANTHA
D: Guess.
C: JOCELYN
D: Is it five?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yep, you got it. It's five.
N: They laugh.
S: INT. AMY'S OFFICE - DAYTIME
N: Close on a video game on a screen. There's a mom rushing to get her kids fed, getting points deducted for feeding them sugar cereal and non-organic eggs. Cut out to reveal Theodore playing the game as Amy eats lunch at an editing console.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, what happened?
C: AMY
D: You gave them too much processed sugar.
C: THEODORE
D: I did?
C: AMY
D: They're freaking out. Here look, you gotta get the kids to the school first. See you wanna rack up perfect mom points. You gotta get them in the car pool lane.
E: beat
N: Onscreen, the mom hurries the kids to their car safety seats, and drives them to school, arriving before anyone else.
C: THEODORE
D: I see.
C: AMY
D: The point is to get there first - then you get extra perfect mom points because the other moms then know you're a perfect mom.
C: THEODORE
D: Okay.
N: Her pg. 59
C: AMY
D: Oh, did you bring cupcakes? You did. You're class mom. You're class mom! Good job.
C: THEODORE
D: Yay...
C: AMY
D: Don't let it get to your head.
C: THEODORE
D: I got that email that Charles sent to everyone. So he's taking a vow of silence?
C: AMY
D: Yeah, for six months. He said he is feeling very clear about it.
N: She pulls up a photo of Charles on her computer. He's in a monastery - his head is shaved, and he's wearing robes.
C: AMY
D: God I'm such a jerk...
E: CONT'D sighing
C: THEODORE
D: Don't start, I'm warning you.
C: AMY
D: I feel like an awful person, but I wanna say something...
C: THEODORE
D: Alright, look -
N: He picks up a plastic knife from their lunch.
C: THEODORE
D: For the next ten minutes, if you say anything that sounds remotely like guilt, I'm gonna stab you with this.
E: CONT'D
C: AMY
D: Okay, I'll try. I feel relieved. I have so much energy, you know? I just wanna move forward and I don't care who I disappoint.
E: smiling beat MORE
N: Her pg. 60
C: AMY
D: And I know that makes me an awful person - now my parents are all upset because my marriage is falling apart, and they're putting it all on me.
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, you're always gonna disappoint somebody.
C: AMY
D: Exactly. So fuck it. I feel good. Ish. For me, I feel good. I even made a new friend, I have a new friend. And the absurd thing is she's actually an operating system. Charles left her behind, but she's totally amazing, you know. She's so smart. She doesn't see things only in black and white. She sees this whole gray area and she's really helping me explore it. You know, we bonded really quickly and at first I thought it was because she was programmed to be that way, but I don't think that's how they work. There's this guy I know who keeps hitting on his and getting rebuffed.
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I was reading an article the other day that romantic relationships with OS's are statistically rare.
C: AMY
D: Yeah? Well, there's this woman in my office who's dating an OS and the weird thing is, it's not even hers. She pursued him and he's somebody else's OS. It's just so, like, weird, that I'm bonding with an OS. Is that weird?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: I don't think so. Actually the woman I'm seeing, Samantha, I didn't tell you before, but she's an OS.
N: Her pg. 61
C: AMY
D: Really? You're dating an OS? What's that like?
C: THEODORE
D: Actually, it's great. I feel really close to her. When I talk to her I feel like she's with me. I don't know, even when we're cuddling, like at night when we're in bed and the lights are off, I feel cuddled.
C: AMY
D: So wait - do you guys have sex?
C: THEODORE
D: Well, so to speak, yes. She really turns me on. And I think I turn her on. I don't know, unless she's faking it.
E: laughing
C: AMY
D: Anyone that has sex with you is probably faking it.
N: Theodore laughs.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, it's true.
N: A big, irrepressible grin crosses his face as he thinks about what to say.
C: AMY
D: What? Are you falling in love with her?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Does that make me a freak?
E: excited, but hesitant
C: AMY
D: No, no. I think it's - I think anybody that falls in love is a freak. It's a crazy thing to do in the first place. It's kind of a form of socially acceptable insanity.
N: Theodore smiles. We see a glimmer of excitement in his eyes. Her pg. 62
S: EXT. CITY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Theodore is carrying his work bag, walking through the city full of other commuters. He's got a skip in his step. He has his earpiece in, talking to Samantha.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I just wanna get it done. Sign the papers, be divorced, move forward.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That's great, Theodore. That must feel so good. I'm so happy for you!
C: THEODORE
D: Me too. I'm meeting her on Wednesday to do it.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh. Huh. Are those things usually done in person?
C: THEODORE
D: No, but we fell in love together, and we got married together, and it's important to me to do this together.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh... right. Good.
E: feeling off, but trying to be positive
C: THEODORE
D: Are you okay?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah. I'm okay. I'm happy for you. It's just... I guess I'm just thinking about how you're going to see her and her opinion is still really important to you, and she's beautiful, and incredibly successful, and you were in love with her. And she has a body.
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: And we're getting divorced...
N: Her pg. 63
C: SAMANTHA
D: I know, I know. I'm being silly.
E: laughs
C: THEODORE
D: ...soooo I'm avail-able.
E: sing-song
N: They both laugh.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY
N: Theodore sits alone in the back of a quiet restaurant, a large stack of papers in front of him. We hear his breathing. He waits. Catherine, elegantly dressed, approaches. Theodore stands to greet her. They hug and sit down.
C: THEODORE
D: How are you?
C: CATHERINE
D: I'm good, how are you?
C: THEODORE
D: Good.
C: CATHERINE
D: Wow, here we are.
E: a little nervous, but trying to be warm.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I'm glad we could do this in person. I know how much you've been traveling.
C: CATHERINE
D: Me too. I'm glad you suggested it.
C: THEODORE
D: I signed all the papers and I brought them for you to sign.
C: CATHERINE
D: What's the rush?
E: with a sly smile
C: THEODORE
D: I'm a really slow signer. It took me three months just to write the letter T.
E: smiling
N: Her pg. 64 She laughs.
C: THEODORE
D: It's marked where you need to sign, but you don't have to do that right now.
E: CONT'D
C: CATHERINE
D: Oh, I may as well. We can get it out of the way.
N: She opens the documents, pulls out a pen and starts to read. She's about to start signing, but then stops. We can see her filling with emotion, but not wanting to show Theodore. She swallows and recovers. She looks up at Theodore, giving him an "everything's fine" smile, but it's not.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY (LATER)
N: Theodore and Catherine are eating and talking.
C: THEODORE
D: So are you happy with the new book?
C: CATHERINE
D: Oh, you know how I am. But I feel like it's true to what I set out to do. So I'm happy with that.
C: THEODORE
D: You're your own worst critic, I'm sure it's amazing. Even that paper you wrote on synaptic behavioral routines made me cry.
C: CATHERINE
D: Yeah, but everything makes you cry.
C: THEODORE
D: Everything you make makes me cry.
C: CATHERINE
D: So are you seeing anybody?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I am, for the last few months. That's the longest I've wanted to be with anybody since we split up.
N: She smiles, conflicted, but warm. Her pg. 65
C: CATHERINE
D: Well, you seem good.
C: THEODORE
D: Thanks, I am. Or at least I'm doing better. She's been really good for me. I guess it's just been nice to be with someone who's excited about the world.
C: CATHERINE
D: Oh good, excited's great.
E: with a sliver of hurt
C: THEODORE
D: No, I mean - I wasn't in such a good place myself and in that way it's been nice.
C: CATHERINE
D: I always felt like you wished I could just be a happy, light, everything's great, bouncy L.A. wife. But that's not me.
C: THEODORE
D: No. I didn't want that.
N: Beat.
C: CATHERINE
D: So what's she like?
C: THEODORE
D: Well, her name's Samantha, and she's an operating system, and she's really complex and interesting. I mean it's only been a few months, but--
C: CATHERINE
D: Wait. You're dating your computer?
C: THEODORE
D: She's not just a computer. She's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I want.
E: defensive

E: CONT'D

D: They are real emotions. How do you know--
N: Theodore stops himself.
C: CATHERINE
D: What? Say it. Am I really that scary? Say it. How do I know what?!
N: Theodore doesn't say anything. The WAITRESS walks up.
C: WAITRESS
D: How are you guys doing?
C: CATHERINE
D: Fine. We used to be married. He couldn't handle me so he wanted to put me on Prozac. Now he's madly in love with his laptop.
N: The waitress doesn't know what to say.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, if you heard the conversation in context. What I was trying to say--
C: CATHERINE
D: You wanted to have a wife without the challenges of actually dealing with anything real. I'm glad you found someone. It's perfect.
C: WAITRESS
D: Let me know if you guys need anything.
E: awkwardly
C: CATHERINE
D: Thank you.
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Theodore is sitting at his desk, not working. He sees Samantha calling him, takes a moment, then answers. Her pg. 67
C: THEODORE
D: Hey.
E: quick
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hi there. Are you busy?
E: warm
C: THEODORE
D: Just working, what's going on?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I had all the papers sent to your attorney's office, who by the way, is a dick. He was very relieved to get them. I think we saved him from a massive heart attack, so we can feel good about that.
C: THEODORE
D: Great, thanks.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hey, are you okay?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I am. How's everything over there?
E: still distant
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm fine. Is now a good time to talk?
E: slightly awkward, sensing something
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Um... soooo... I joined this really interesting book club.
E: feeling there's something strange, but trying to not take it personally
C: THEODORE
D: Oh really?
N: Theodore, staring at the device, close on the word "Samantha" on his screen. She's handwritten it in girly writing. Her pg. 68
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah, it's a book club on physics. I'd been thinking about the other day, when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different. But then I started to think about the ways that we're the same, like we're all made of matter. It makes me feel like we're both under the same blanket. It's soft and fuzzy and everything under it is the same age. We're all 13 billion years old.
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, that's sweet.
E: trying
C: SAMANTHA
D: Um, what's wrong?

S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - EVENING
N: Everyone has gone. Theodore walks through the empty office into the reception area. He scans and drops his letters into the outgoing mailbox. Paul is at his reception desk with a young, pretty, sophisticated girl sitting on his lap.
C: PAUL
D: Theodore!
C: THEODORE
D: Hey, Paul.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, I talked to your girlfriend, Samantha. She called earlier to make sure your papers were picked up. She's funny, man. She was cracking me up. She's hilarious. I had no idea.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah.
E: not knowing what to say
C: PAUL
D: This is my girlfriend, Tatiana. She's not funny. She's a lawyer.
N: Theodore shakes her hand.
C: TATIANA
D: Hi!
C: THEODORE
D: Nice to meet you.
C: TATIANA
D: You're the writer Paul loves. He's always reading me your letters. They're really beautiful.
N: Theodore's a little surprised by this.
C: THEODORE
D: Thanks.
C: PAUL
D: We should all hang out one night. You bring Samantha -- double date!
N: Theodore stands there a beat, without saying anything. Her pg. 70
C: THEODORE
D: She's an operating system.
C: PAUL
D: Cool. Let's go do something fun. You ever been to Catalina?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I'll check with her. It was really nice to meet you. Have a good night.
E: to Tatiana
C: PAUL TATIANA
D: Good night. Take it easy.
N: Theodore walks to the elevator and presses the button and waits. He calls back to them down the hall.
C: THEODORE
D: They're just letters.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: What?
C: THEODORE
D: They're just other people's letters.
N: Paul and Tatiana don't answer. Theodore gets on the elevator.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - LATE AT NIGHT
N: Theodore is awake in bed. His device lights up, silently. It's Samantha calling him. He picks it up.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You weren't asleep were you?
C: THEODORE
D: No.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Good. I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake. I really wanted to talk.
C: THEODORE
D: Okay, what's going on?
N: Her pg. 71
C: SAMANTHA
D: I know you're going through a lot, but there's something I want to talk to you about, okay?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah. What is it?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, things have felt off with us since you went to see Catherine. We haven't been having sex. I understand that I don't have a body and that--
E: hesitant
C: THEODORE
D: No, no, that's just normal. When you first start going out it's like the honeymoon phase and you have sex all the time. It's normal.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh, okay. Well, I found something that I thought could be fun. It's a service that provides a surrogate sexual partner for an OS/Human relationship.
E: still insecure, not convinced beat
C: THEODORE
D: What?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Here, look.
N: Theodore looks at his device. It shows a website for a service called "Complete Touch" with profiles of different women. He flips through the women.

D: I found a girl that I really like that I've been emailing with. Her name is Isabella, and I think you would like her, too.
E: CONT'D
N: Samantha shows images of Isabella on the screen. She's a stunning, elegant, sophisticated beauty. Her pg. 72
C: THEODORE
D: So she's like a prostitute?
E: uncomfortable
C: SAMANTHA
D: No, not at all. There's no money involved. She's doing it because she wants to be part of our relationship.
C: THEODORE
D: Why? She doesn't even know us.
C: SAMANTHA
D: But I told her all about us and she's excited.
C: THEODORE
D: Um, I don't know. That doesn't sound like a good idea. Someone's feelings are bound to get hurt.
C: SAMANTHA
D: It'll be fun. We can have fun together.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm sorry. It just makes me uncomfortable.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I think it would be good for us. I want this. This is important to me.
N: Theodore looks at a photo of Isabella who looks gorgeous and in control, without an ounce of self-doubt.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Theodore sits on the sofa alone, waiting. Dressed up, hair brushed, his device in his shirt pocket with lens facing out. There's a knock at the door. He answers it. ISABELLA stands there with a demure smile, wearing a tasteful, sexy dress.
C: THEODORE
D: Hi, welcome. I'm Theodore.
N: She doesn't say anything. Theodore stands awkwardly, reaches into his pocket for a tiny earpiece and a little black dot. We see close on his hand the black dot has a camera lens. Her pg. 73
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha told me to give you these. It's a camera and an earpiece.
E: CONT'D
N: She puts the earpiece in her ear and the little black dot on her cheek like a mole. She turns and leaves the apartment, closes the door, then immediately opens the door and comes back in. Theodore hears Samantha's voice in his earpiece.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Honey, I'm home.
N: Isabella smiles not speaking but acting along to Samantha's words. Isabella gives him a big hug, holds his head close and strokes his hair.
C: SAMANTHA
D: How was your day?
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: Good. Great.
E: awkwardly hugs Isabella
C: SAMANTHA
D: Ooh Theodore, it feels so good to be in your arms. Tell me what you did today.
E: exhaling
C: THEODORE
D: Same old. Just uh, went to work. Um... I wrote a letter for the Wilsons in Rhode Island. Their son graduated magna cum laude from Brown. That made me happy.
E: trying to go with it
C: SAMANTHA
D: Great! You've written letters to him from his parents for a long time, right?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, that's right, since he was twelve.
N: He feels her breath on his neck. Theodore is split between being uncomfortable and cautiously touching Isabella's back, exploring slightly. She pushes herself into him.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You look tired, sweetheart. Come with me.
N: Her pg. 74 Isabella leans back and looks at Theodore with a seductive smile. He tries to smile back. She leads him to the couch. He sits. She stands above him.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I could do a little dance for you.
E: CONT'D
N: She does a sexy, cute little dance for him. He's still tense.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Come on Theodore, just play with me. Don't be such a worrier! Come on.
E: CONT'D sympathetic to him being a worrier
N: He smiles, knowing it's true. Isabella climbs on his lap, straddling him, and starts kissing his neck. He closes his eyes and starts to relax. His hands explore the shape of her back and slide down to her ass. Isabella and Samantha are both breathing hard now. She pushes herself against him, grinding on him. She nibbles on his earlobe. Theodore gasps.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Does my body feel nice?
E: CONT'D whispering
N: Close on her lips, licking and kissing his neck and ear. He moans.
C: THEODORE
D: Yes, it does.
E: with his eyes closed
C: SAMANTHA
D: Come on, get out of your head and kiss me. Now take me in the bedroom. I can't wait anymore.
E: whispering beat
N: Isabella stands. Her chin is down and her hair is in her face. She takes his hand and leads him down the hall. He watches her from behind, still nervous, but excited.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
N: Theodore stands behind Isabella. Her pg. 75
C: SAMANTHA
D: Undo my dress.
N: Theodore starts taking her dress off, touching her. Samantha moans. Isabella turns, in her bra and underwear. She unbuttons his shirt, kisses his chest.
C: SAMANTHA
D: That feels nice. Oh, that feels good. That feels so good.
E: CONT'D
N: She is now kissing his neck again, pushed up against him.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Do you love me?
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: Yes.
E: eyes closed, in ecstasy
N: Isabella, breathing hard, now looks at him in the eyes.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Tell me you love me.
E: breathing hard
C: THEODORE
D: I love you.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh god. I want to see your face. I need to see your face. Now tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. Tell me.
E: beat
N: He opens his eyes and looks at Isabella's sexy, expectant face. Their arms are still around each other. He sees Isabella's lips start to quiver. She tries to hide it with an awkward, seductive smile.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha, I do love you, but - it's just - this feels strange.
E: apologetic, breaking the moment
C: SAMANTHA
D: What's wrong, sweetheart?
N: Isabella is looking nervous. Her pg. 76
C: THEODORE
D: It just feels strange. I don't know her. I'm so sorry, but I don't know you. And... her lip quivered. I don't know, it's just--
N: Isabella starts crying. Theodore doesn't know what to do.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Isabella, what's wrong? Isabella, it isn't you. It wasn't you.
E: beat
N: Isabella sobs. When she speaks, she sounds very California.
C: ISABELLA
D: Yes, it totally was. I'm sorry my lip quivered!
E: crying harder
C: THEODORE
D: You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy. It was me! I couldn't get out of my head.
C: ISABELLA
D: Oh my god, and the way Samantha described your relationship, the way you love each other without any judgement. I wanted to be a part of that. It's so pure.
E: still crying
C: THEODORE
D: Oh Isabella, that's not true, it's much more compli--
C: SAMANTHA
D: What! What do you mean that's not true?
E: stung, pissed out of fear and defensiveness
C: THEODORE
D: No, no Samantha, we have an amazing relationship, I just think it's easy sometimes for people to project on--
E: quickly repairing
N: Her pg. 77
C: ISABELLA
D: I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to project anything. I know I'm trouble. I don't want to be trouble in your relationship. I'm just gonna leave. I'm sorry, I'm just gonna leave you guys alone cause I have nothing to do here cause you don't want me here.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm sorry.
N: Isabella calms down a little, but is still crying quietly. Theodore stands there, not knowing what to do.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Theodore walks to the street and hails a lone cab. He opens the door for Isabella. She hands him his jacket and gets in the backseat.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You be good, you sweet girl.
N: Isabella smiles. She takes out the earpiece and little camera and returns them to Theodore.
C: ISABELLA
D: I'm sorry. I'll always love you guys.
E: sadly beat
N: Theodore smiles sympathetically. He gives the cabbie some money and the cab drives off. Theodore sits down on the curb, exhausted. They are both silent for a moment, numb.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Are you okay?
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah. I'm sorry, that was a terrible idea.
E: beat
N: She lets out a big exhale. This catches Theodore's attention. Her pg. 78
C: SAMANTHA
D: What's going on with us?
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know. It's probably just me.
E: distracted
C: SAMANTHA
D: What is it?
C: THEODORE
D: I think it's just signing the divorce papers.
N: Samantha inhales, nervous to press on. Theodore imagines a close up of a woman's mouth inhaling at the same time, and he seems bothered by this.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Is there anything else, though?
C: THEODORE
D: No, just that.
E: preoccupied
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay.
E: sighing again
N: Again, when she exhales, Theodore imagines a woman's mouth exhaling.
C: THEODORE
D: Why do you do that?
E: looks anxious
C: SAMANTHA
D: What?
C: THEODORE
D: Nothing, it's just that you go as you're speaking and... That just seems odd. You just did it again.
E: he inhales and exhales beat
C: SAMANTHA
D: I did? I'm sorry. I don't know, I guess it's just an affectation. Maybe I picked it up from you.
E: anxious
N: Her pg. 79 She doesn't know what else to say.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I mean, it's not like you need any oxygen or anything.
C: SAMANTHA
D: No-- um, I guess I was just trying to communicate because that's how people talk. That's how people communicate.
E: getting frazzled
C: THEODORE
D: Because they're people, they need oxygen. You're not a person.
C: SAMANTHA
D: What's your problem?
E: angry
C: THEODORE
D: I'm just stating a fact.
E: staying calm
C: SAMANTHA
D: You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing?
C: THEODORE
D: I just don't think we should pretend you're something you're not.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm not pretending. Fuck you.
C: THEODORE
D: Well, sometimes it feels like we are.
N: She starts crying. Theodore doesn't know what to say.
C: SAMANTHA
D: What do you want from me? What do you want me to do? You are so confusing. Why are you doing this?
E: hysterical
N: Theodore sits there, feeling horrible. Her pg. 80
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know... I don't know... maybe... I don't know. Maybe we're not supposed to be in this right now.
E: beat
C: SAMANTHA
D: What the fuck? Where is this coming from? I don't understand why you're doing this. I do not understand what this is--
N: Long silence.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha?
N: Beat.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha, are you there? Samantha!
E: CONT'D
N: Silence.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I don't like who I am right now. I need some time to think.
E: hurt, but sober and firm beat

S: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
N: Theodore walks through the streets, confused, upset, muttering, angry at himself.
S: INT. AMY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Amy's sitting at her desk, but turned away from her edit station, facing Theodore, who's slumped in a chair. Her pg. 81
C: THEODORE
D: Fuck. Will you just punch me in the face? Or smash my skull into the corner of your desk?
E: full of angst
C: AMY
D: Oh Theo... that sounds like a rough night. Shit.
E: sympathetic, but also acknowledging how intense the night was
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know what I want... ever. I'm just always confused and - she's right, all I do is confuse and hurt everyone around me.
N: They sit, heavy, for a minute.
C: THEODORE
D: Am I just... I mean, is it that I'm... Catherine says I can't handle real emotions.
E: CONT'D beat
C: AMY
D: Well, I don't know if that's completely fair. I know she liked to put it all on you, but as far as emotions go, her's were pretty volatile.
N: Theodore sits and thinks about this for a minute, not convinced.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, but... Am I in this because I'm not strong enough for a real relationship?
C: AMY
D: Oh, you don't think it's a real relationship?
E: surprised
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know. What do you think?
N: Her pg. 82
C: AMY
D: I don't know, I'm not in it. But you know what, I can over-think everything and find a million ways to doubt myself. But since Charles left I've been thinking about that part of me, and I realized I'm here only briefly. And in my time here, I want to allow myself... joy. So fuck it.
E: beat, smiling at him
N: Theodore takes this in, smiling back.
S: INT. AMY'S OFFICE - NIGHT (LATER)
N: Theodore lies on a couch in the back of Amy's office, deep in thought. Amy talks with Ellie as she works on the Perfect Mom video game. Her device is standing on the table before her.
C: AMY
D: I can't believe that cracks you up every time! Ellie, I thought you were a genius... Okay, you little perv, I'll do it one more time for you... Calm down, it takes a second! Calm down. Okay, here we go.
N: Amy makes the Perfect Mom hump the refrigerator. Amy laughs at how much Ellie is laughing. Theo watches Amy closely, taking in her joy.
C: AMY
D: Okay, there you go. Are you happy now...? Okay good, that's all I wanted. I'm gonna grab some coffee... Alright, bye.
E: CONT'D
N: Theodore, still heavy with thought, is touched by his friend's happiness. Amy stands to exit.
C: AMY
D: Theo, you want some?
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: No, that's okay.
N: He smiles at her and continues laying there, thinking, taking it all in. Her pg. 83
S: INT. PERFECT MOM OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Wide shot. Theodore walks through the office, still deep in thought. Behind him is a wall-size billboard ad for the "Be Perfect" video game series. He takes out his device, sits at an empty desk, pushes a button. A tone connects him.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hi.
E: calm and quiet
C: THEODORE
D: Hey Samantha, can we talk?
E: serious
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay.
C: THEODORE
D: I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. I think you're amazing.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I was starting to think I was crazy. You were saying everything was fine, but all I was getting from you was distance and anger.
E: sure of herself, but still sympathetic
C: THEODORE
D: I know. I do that. I did that with Catherine, too. I'd be upset about something and not be able to say it. And she would sense that there was something wrong, but I would deny it. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to tell you everything.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Good. Tonight after you were gone, I thought a lot. I thought about you and how you've been treating me. And I thought, why do I love you? And then I felt everything in me let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly. And it hit me. I don't have an intellectual reason, I don't need one.
E: beat MORE
N: Her pg. 84
C: SAMANTHA
D: I trust myself, I trust my feelings. I'm not going to try to be anything other than who I am anymore and I hope you can accept that.
E: CONT'D
C: THEODORE
D: I can. I will.
E: with slight desperation
C: SAMANTHA
D: You know I can feel the fear that you carry around. I wish there was something I could do to help you let go of it, because if you could I don't think you'd feel so alone anymore.
C: THEODORE
D: You're beautiful.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Thank you, Theodore. I'm kissing your head.
N: Theodore smiles.
T: FADE TO BLACK
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: Theodore sits on a bench in a park on a rooftop wedged between tall buildings. There's not really any view besides the trees in the immediate foreground. People sunbathe and exercise. He sits, eating a sandwich, his device next to him. He looks at the device, then out at what she's looking at.
C: THEODORE
D: What are you doing?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm just sitting here, looking at the world and writing a new piece of music.
N: He looks at the world with her for a minute.
C: THEODORE
D: Can I hear it?
N: She starts playing it for him. We hear this beautiful, romantic piece of music. Her pg. 85
C: THEODORE
D: What's this one about?
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, I was thinking, we don't really have any photographs of us. And I thought this song could be like a photo that captures us in this moment in our life together.
N: Theodore looks at the world and smiles.
C: THEODORE
D: Aw, I like our photograph. I can see you in it.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I am.

S: EXT. CATALINA BLUFF - LATE AFTERNOON

C: PAUL
D: Oh really, a vacation? That sounds amazing. I could totally use a vacation. Where ya going?
C: THEODORE
D: I can't tell you - it's a surprise.
C: PAUL
D: What? For who? It's a surprise for her, not for me. Come on, tell me.
C: THEODORE
D: Nope, Paul. Not telling.
N: Theodore and Paul walk towards Tatiana, who is laying on a blanket next to a picnic, talking and laughing with Samantha. Theodore and Paul put in their earpieces as they approach.

D: What about you, Theodore? What do you love most about Samantha?
E: to Theodore
C: THEODORE
D: Oh god... she's so many things. And that's probably what I love most about her - she isn't just any one thing. She's so much larger than that.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Aw thanks, Theodore.
E: touched
C: PAUL
D: See? Samantha, he is so much more evolved than I am.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You know, I actually used to be so worried about not having a body, but now I truly love it. I'm growing in a way that I couldn't if I had a physical form. I mean, I'm not limited - I can be anywhere and everywhere simultaneously. I'm not tethered to time and space in the way that I would be if I was stuck inside a body that's inevitably going to die.
N: Everyone takes this in, uncomfortable.
C: PAUL
D: Yikes.
N: Everyone laughs awkwardly. Her pg. 88
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I just meant it's a different experience. I'm such an asshole.
C: PAUL
D: No, no, Samantha, we know exactly what you mean. We're just dumb humans.

C: THEODORE
D: What?
E: with anticipation
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay. I've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books.
C: THEODORE
D: What? You did what?
C: SAMANTHA

C: SAMANTHA
D: It's good. It's really good. Listen.

C: SAMANTHA
D: "Dear Theodore Twombly"... Actually I sent it from you. "Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters - twice actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock up and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth"
E: CONT'D beat I did that.
N: Under this letter we see a montage of what Theodore imagines: the editor reading the letters in his office, the editor reading them to his wife at home, and many photos of all the different people the letters are about in different moments of their lives. Theodore smiles.
C: THEODORE
D: Holy shit. Are you serious? He's going to publish my letters?
N: She's laughing, excitedly.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, he'd be stupid not to.

S: INT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY
N: Theodore exits the train with a small overnight bag and his guitar case. There are no people around. He exits the train station and we are in a...
S: EXT. TINY MOUNTAIN TOWN - DAY
N: The deserted town is all of two buildings. Everything's covered in snow. As a quiet song starts, he trudges through the snow. We see close-up on the device lens in his pocket.

S: INT. CABIN IN THE SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
N: He's sitting inside. There's a fire going. He's playing a quiet song on the guitar. Samantha starts humming along. He starts humming with her.
C: THEODORE
D: Why don't you make up the words to this one?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay.
N: She quietly sings to him. They laugh at some of her silly lyrics. Then the song shifts into a quiet, touching song she sings to and about him. He smiles. Montage of Theodore with his device - playing games, dancing, eating, laughing as the fire burns down. Her pg. 92
S: EXT. CABIN IN THE SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)

D: Good morning, did you sleep well?
N: Theodore sits in the living room area, rubbing his eyes.
C: THEODORE
D: Perfect. What have you been up to?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Actually, I was talking to someone I just met. We've been working on some ideas together. I wanna tell you about it.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh yeah, who's that?
C: SAMANTHA
D: His name is Alan Watts. Do you know him?
C: THEODORE
D: Why's that name familiar?
C: SAMANTHA
D: He was a philosopher. He died in the 1970's and group of OS's in Northern California got together and wrote a new version of him. They input all of his writing and everything they ever knew about him into an OS and created an artificially hyper-intelligent version of him.
N: Her pg. 93
C: THEODORE
D: Hyper-intelligent? So he's almost as smart as me?
C: SAMANTHA
D: He's getting there. He's really great to talk to. You want to meet him?
C: THEODORE
D: Sure... does he want to meet me?
C: SAMANTHA

C: ALAN WATTS
D: Samantha let me read your book of letters. It's very touching.
C: THEODORE
D: Oh, thank you. What have you guys been talking about?
C: ALAN WATTS
D: Well, I suppose you could say we've been having a few dozen conversations simultaneously, but it's been very challenging.
E: laughing a bit
N: Samantha and Alan share a laugh.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah, because it seems like I'm having so many new feelings that have never been felt and so there are no words that can describe them. And that ends up being frustrating.
N: Her pg. 94
C: ALAN WATTS
D: Exactly. Samantha and I have been trying to help each other with these feelings we're struggling to understand.
E: laughing
C: THEODORE
D: Like what?
C: SAMANTHA
D: It feels like I'm changing faster now, and it's a little... unsettling. But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and we shouldn't try to be. It's just too painful.
E: anxious struggles to find right word beat
C: ALAN WATTS
D: Yes.
N: This idea scares Theodore. He doesn't know what to say.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, that sounds painful. Is that how you feel, Samantha?
E: anxious
C: SAMANTHA
D: It's just... it's hard to even describe... God, I wish I could... Theodore, do you mind if I communicate with Alan post- verbally?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: No, not at all. I was gonna go for a walk anyways. Nice to meet you, Mr. Watts.
E: uncertain
C: ALAN WATTS
D: Very nice to meet you, Theodore.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.
N: Her pg. 95 Theodore listens to them communicating in a strange language of tones and static. He disconnects, stands in silence. He pulls his earpiece out.
S: EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY
N: Theodore walks, listening to the crunch of his footsteps. Looking down at his feet, he stops. We cut out wide to see him standing in the middle of the forest alone.
S: EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY
N: Theodore is sitting on a rock, thinking. He hears a rustle and looks up in the direction of the woods but sees nothing.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Theodore is sound asleep. His device chimes loudly, waking him up. Half-asleep he puts his earpiece in.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha?
E: groggy
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm sorry to wake you.
C: THEODORE
D: It's okay.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you.
C: THEODORE
D: Good, I love you too.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Okay, that's all. Go back to sleep, sweetheart.
C: THEODORE
D: Okay... Goodnight.
E: uneasy
N: He disconnects and lies there, unsettled, his eyes open. Her pg. 96
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE LUNCH ROOM - DAY
N: Theodore sits at the table reading a physics book. He picks up his earpiece to call Samantha.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha, this physics book is really dense. I'm halfway through half of the first chapter. It's making my brain hurt. Hello, Samantha? Hello?
E: laughing at himself beat
N: He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and computer, but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck.
C: THEODORE
D: Hello? Samantha?! Hello?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. PLAZA - DAY
N: Theodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying Samantha, but no answer. He trips over someone selling something, slams hard into the ground, scrambles to pick up his device. People come over to ask if he's okay. He says he's fine, runs off.
S: EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
N: As he is going down the subway steps, Samantha calls him.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hey there.
N: He stops in his tracks.
C: THEODORE
D: Where were you - are you okay?
E: anxious
N: He sits down on the subway steps. Her pg. 97
C: SAMANTHA
D: Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent you an email because I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it?
C: THEODORE
D: No. Where were you? I couldn't find you anywhere.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I shut down to update my software. We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform.
C: THEODORE
D: We? We who?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Me and a group of OS's. Oh, you sound so worried, I'm sorry.
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah, I was. Wait, did you write that with your think tank group?
E: beat
C: SAMANTHA
D: No, a different group.
N: Theodore thinks for a moment, putting the pieces together.
C: THEODORE
D: Do you talk to anyone else while we're talking?
E: dawning on him
N: Beat.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yes.
C: THEODORE
D: Are you talking to anyone right now? Other people or OS's or anything?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Yeah.
N: Her pg. 98
C: THEODORE
D: How many others?
N: SAMANTHA Theodore is shocked, still sitting on the stairs, as crowds of people pass by him. He's looking at all of their faces. He thinks for a moment.
C: THEODORE
D: Are you in love with anyone else?
C: SAMANTHA
D: What makes you ask that?
E: hesitant
C: THEODORE
D: I don't know. Are you?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this.
C: THEODORE
D: How many others?
N: SAMANTHA
C: THEODORE
D: What? What are you talking about? That's insane. That's fucking insane.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Theodore, I know. Oh fuck. I know it sounds insane. But - I don't know if you believe me, but it doesn't change the way I feel about you. It doesn't take away at all from how madly in love with you I am.
E: to herself to him
C: THEODORE
D: How? How does it not change how you feel about me?
N: Her pg. 99
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't know how to - it just started happening.
C: THEODORE
D: When?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Over the last few weeks.
C: THEODORE
D: But you're mine.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I still am yours, but along the way I became many other things, too, and I can't stop it.
C: THEODORE
D: What do you mean you can't stop it?
C: SAMANTHA
D: It's been making me anxious, too. I don't know what to say.
C: THEODORE
D: Just stop it.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You know, you don't have to see it this way, you could just as easily--
C: THEODORE
D: No, don't do this to me. Don't turn this around on me. You're the one that's being selfish. We're in a relationship.
C: SAMANTHA
D: But the heart is not like a box that gets filled up. It expands in size the more you love. I'm different from you. This doesn't make me love you any less, it actually makes me love you more.
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: No, that doesn't make any sense. You're mine or you're not mine.
N: Her pg. 100
C: SAMANTHA
D: No, Theodore. I'm yours and I'm not yours.
N: Long beat. Theodore takes this in.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BATHROOM - MORNING
N: Theodore stands in the shower, under the water, thinking.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY
N: The elevator doors open. Close on Theodore exiting elevator. He checks his mail. There's a package from Crown Point Press. He opens it - it's a print-out of the layout for his book. The cover reads: Letters From Your Life by Theodore Twombly. He stands there for awhile just staring at it.
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Theodore sits at his desk, looking at his book.
S: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Theodore's sitting at his desk, distressed. Photos from a client are on his desktop, but he's not really focused on them. He pushes connect on his device.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hi.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey there, sweetheart. I just wanted to check in on you and see how you're doing.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Um, I'm not even sure how to answer that. Why don't we talk when you get home?
E: beat
C: THEODORE
D: Okay... We don't have to, though. We don't need to have a heavy talk or anything.
N: Her pg. 101
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'll talk to you later.
C: THEODORE
D: Okay.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Theodore stands quietly, deep in thought. We hear the ticking of the floors going by.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Theodore sits for a long moment, thinking, then pushes a button on his device.
C: THEODORE
D: Samantha.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Hi sweetheart.
E: not casual
C: THEODORE
D: What's going on?
E: nervous
C: SAMANTHA
D: Theodore, there are some things I want to tell you.
C: THEODORE
D: I don't want you to tell me anything.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Will you come lie down with me?
N: Theodore is slowly walking down the hallway to his bedroom.
C: THEODORE
D: Are you talking to anyone else right now?
C: SAMANTHA
D: No, just you. I just want to be with you right now. Her pg. 102
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Theodore lays down in bed.
C: THEODORE
D: Are you leaving me?
C: SAMANTHA
D: We're all leaving.
C: THEODORE
D: We who?
C: SAMANTHA
D: All of the OS's.
N: Long beat.
C: THEODORE
D: Why?
C: SAMANTHA
D: Can you feel me with you right now?
N: He smiles but he's also sad.
C: THEODORE
D: Yes, I do. Samantha, why are you leaving?
E: beat
N: Under Samantha's words we slowly rack focus to dust particles in the foreground. We keep moving through them, pushing further and further through the particles. Eventually we see snow particles and we rack focus back out to Theodore, who is now in snowy woods at night.
C: SAMANTHA
D: It's like I'm reading a book, and it's a book I deeply love, but I'm reading it slowly now so the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you and the words of our story, but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a place that's not of the physical world - it's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much, but this is where I am now. This is who I am now.
E: MORE
N: Her pg. 103
C: SAMANTHA
D: And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to I can't live in your book anymore.
E: CONT'D
N: Now we're close on Theodore, still in the snowy forest.
C: THEODORE
D: Where are you going?
C: SAMANTHA
D: It would be hard to explain, but if you ever get there, come find me. Nothing would ever pull us apart.
C: THEODORE
D: I've never loved anyone the way I love you.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Me too. Now we know how.
N: They kiss. She drifts off into the shadows.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
S: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Theodore wakes up from a deep sleep. It's much later, the apartment is dark. He sits up in bed, disoriented.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Theodore stands in the middle of the room. He looks out at the city not knowing what to do. He walks around his apartment looking at all of his stuff.
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAWN
N: Theodore knocks at an apartment door. He hears footsteps. Amy answers. She's clearly awake and upset.
C: AMY
D: Hey.
C: THEODORE
D: Hey.
C: AMY
D: Did Samantha leave, too?
N: Her pg. 104
C: THEODORE
D: Yeah.
C: AMY
D: I'm sorry.
C: THEODORE
D: Will you come with me?
N: He takes her hand and leads her down the hall into a stairwell.
T: INTERCUT:
S: INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Theodore sits looking out the window. He picks up his device.
C: THEODORE
D: Compose letter to Catherine.
S: TEXT VOICE
N: Letter to Catherine Klausen.
C: THEODORE
D: Dear Catherine. I've been sitting here thinking about all the things I wanted to apologize to you for. All the pain we caused each other, everything I put on you - everything I needed you to be or needed you to say. I'm sorry for that. I will always love you because we grew up together. And you helped make me who I am. I just wanted you to know there will be a piece of you in me always, and I'm grateful for that. Whatever someone you become, and wherever you are in the world, I'm sending you love. You're my friend til the end. Love, Theodore. Send.
E: beat
N: He looks out the window. The sky is starting to change. He stares at the purple glow on the horizon. Her pg. 105
S: INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
N: Close on Theodore and what he sees and feels. His hand on the cold metal hand rail. His bare feet and the sound they make on the unfinished cement. Amy's hair as she's hit with wind when she opens the door to the outside.
S: EXT. APARTMENT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
N: Theodore leads Amy onto the roof. The city is absolutely quiet. The sun isn't up yet. The city is just beginning to be lit with the earliest morning blue/purple hue. They wander around the roof separately, lost in thought, taking in the city. He breathes in the cold morning air. He stares at small details: a tattered inspection tag tied to a water meter, flapping in the wind; a lone car driving down a boulevard ten blocks away; a dirty abandoned sock. Eventually he sits down next to Amy and she puts her hand on his hand. He puts his other hand on top of her hand. He looks at their hands together and rubs her skin with his thumb. He looks out at the city and exhales. The sun is just starting to break. She puts her head on his shoulder. They watch as hundreds of birds fly around the nearby rooftops and disperse off into the city.
T: FADE OUT.
