M: AN ENDLESS SKY AT TWILIGHT
N: Foreboding. Heat lightning in the distance. Miles of unforgiving, summer-scorched prairie.
C: BEVERLY
D: ..."Life is very long..."
E: OS
N: MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD Two lanes, not a car in sight. Cracked asphalt undulates over gentle, browned hills, disappears into an infinite horizon.
C: BEVERLY
D: TS Eliot. Not the first person to say it, certainly not the first person to think it.
E: OS
N: A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK Flat, still. An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly, tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock.
C: BEVERLY
D: But he's given credit for it because he bothered to write it down.
E: OS
N: AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL At the end of a long gravel road. Surrounded by towering black walnuts and lace-bark elms. A farm once, no one's put a plow to earth here in decades.
C: BEVERLY
D: So if you say it, you have to say his name after it. "Life is very long:" TS Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right.
E: OS
N: Wrap around porches, forgotten gardens. Imposing in the gathering gloom. A single downstairs window glows.
C: BEVERLY
D: Give the devil his due. Very few poets could've made it through Eliot's trial and come out, brilliantined and double-breasted and Anglican. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 2.
E: OS CONT'D
N: And now, a face fills the screen --
S: INT. BEVERLY'S DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT
N: BEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie. We take a long moment, just to study that face.
C: BEVERLY
D: Not hard to imagine, faced with Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how Crane or Berryman might have reacted, just foot-raced to the nearest bridge; Olympian Suicidalists.
N: Stares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon.
C: BEVERLY
D: Not Eliot: after sufficient years of ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the nearest asylum and get on with it.
E: CONT'D
N: He sits at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses a glass of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his careful selection of words than drunkenness. He's talking to someone we do not yet see.
C: BEVERLY
D: God-a-mighty. You have to admire the purity of the survivor's instinct.
E: CONT'D
N: From somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling.
C: BEVERLY
D: Violet. My wife. She takes pills, sometimes a great many. They affect... among other things, her equilibrium. Fortunately, they eliminate her need for equilibrium...
E: CONT'D
S: INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
N: Full of shadows. She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets. We're on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint light from the open bathroom door. She hesitates on the edge of the bed, getting her bearings. Finds a pack of Winstons, lights one. Listens to the voices filtering up from below. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 3.
S: INT. THE STUDY - TWILIGHT
N: Beverly shifts, waiting for the sound of more movement from the rooms overhead. When there is none --
C: BEVERLY
D: My wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TWILIGHT
N: She gathers herself to stand. Moves to the door. We FOLLOW HER CLOSELY. Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into --
C: BEVERLY
D: The reasons why we partake are anymore inconsequential.
N: The hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters.
C: BEVERLY
D: The facts are: my wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck, just one paragraph of our marriage contract... cruel covenant. And these facts have over time made burdensome the maintenance of traditional American routine.
E: CONT'D
N: She makes her way to the stairs starts down.
C: BEVERLY
D: Rather than once more vow abstinence with my fingers crossed in the queasy hope of righting our ship, I've chosen to turn my life over to a Higher Power and join the ranks of the Hiring Class.
E: CONT'D
N: The light from the study slices across the living room.
C: BEVERLY
D: It's not a decision with which I'm entirely comfortable. I know how to launder my dirty undies. Done it all my life, but I'm finding it's getting in the way of my drinking.
E: CONT'D
N: She can see a portion of Beverly's desk, a woman's legs. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 4.
C: BEVERLY
D: Sorry about the heat in here. My wife is cold-blooded and not just in the metaphorical sense. She does not believe in air-conditioning... as if it is a thing to be disbelieved. I knew your father, you know. Bought many a watermelon from Mr Youngblood's fruit stand. He did pass, didn't he??
E: CONT'D
C: JOHNNA
D: Yes, sir.
C: BEVERLY
D: May I ask how?
C: JOHNNA
D: He had a heart attack. Fell into a flatbed truck full of wine grapes.
C: BEVERLY
D: Wine grapes. In Oklahoma. I'm sorry.
C: VIOLET
D: Bev...?!
C: BEVERLY
D: Yes?
C: VIOLET
D: Did you pullish? Did you...Oh, goddamn * it... did. You. Are the police here?
C: BEVERLY
D: No...
N: She stands in the shadows of the living room, confused.
C: VIOLET
D: Am I looking through window? A window?
C: BEVERLY
D: Can you come here?
N: She steps into the study, emerging from the darkness into light to reveal: VIOLET WESTON. Dissipated, dishevelled, late sixties. She wears pajamas and a much slept-in robe.
C: VIOLET
D: Oh. Hello.
N: She's staring at a woman sitting in front of Beverly's desk: JOHNNA. Thirty, Native American, simply dressed. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 5.
C: BEVERLY
D: Johnna, the young woman I told you about.
C: VIOLET
D: You tell me she's a woman. Wo-man. Whoa-man.
C: BEVERLY
D: That I'm hiring --
C: VIOLET
D: Oh, you hire women's now the thing. I thought you meant the other woman.
C: BEVERLY
D: To cook and clean, take you to the clinic and to the --
C: VIOLET
D: In the int'rest of ...civil action, your par-tic-u-lars way of speak- king, I thought you meant you had thought a whoa-man to be HIRED!
E: over-articulating

D: I don't understand you.

D: Hello.
E: winsome, to Johnna
C: JOHNNA
D: Hello.
C: VIOLET
D: I'm sorry. Like this.
E: curtsies
C: JOHNNA
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: VIOLET
D: You're very pretty.
C: JOHNNA
D: Thank you.
C: VIOLET
D: Are you an Indian? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 6.
C: JOHNNA
D: Yes, ma'am.
N: VIOLET * What kind? * JOHNNA * Cheyenne. *
C: VIOLET
D: Do you think I'm pretty?
C: JOHNNA
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: VIOLET
D: Like...this? Like this?
E: curtsies again curtsies again
N: She stumbles, catches herself.
C: BEVERLY
D: Careful...
C: VIOLET
D: You're the house now. I'm sorry, I took some medicine for my mussss... muscular.
C: BEVERLY
D: Why don't you go back to bed, sweetheart?
C: VIOLET
D: Why don't you go fuck a fucking sow's ass?
C: BEVERLY
D: All right.
C: VIOLET
D: I'm sorry. I'll be sickly sweet. I'm soooooooo sweet. In-el-abrially sweet.
N: She smiles at Johnna, goes. Beverly watches her disappear back up the stairs, then -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 7.
C: BEVERLY
D: We keep unusual hours here. Try not to differentiate between night and day. You won't be able to keep a healthy routine.
C: JOHNNA
D: I need the work.
C: BEVERLY
D: I myself require very little attention, thrive without it, sort of a human cactus. My wife has been diagnosed with a touch of cancer, so she'll need to be driven to Tulsa for her final chemotherapy treatments. You're welcome to use that American- made behemoth parked out in the drive. Welcome to make use of anything, everything, all this garbage we've acquired, our life's work. Do you have any questions?
C: JOHNNA
D: What kind of cancer?
C: BEVERLY
D: My God, I nearly neglected the punch line: mouth cancer.
C: JOHNNA
D: What pills does she take?
C: BEVERLY
D: Valium. Vicodin. Darvon, Darvocet. Percodan, Percocet. Xanax for fun. OxyContin in a pinch. And of course Diluadid. I can't forget Diluadid.
N: Beverly wobbles to his feet, explores his bookshelf.
C: BEVERLY
D: "By night within that ancient house, Immense, black, damned, anonymous." My last refuge, my books: simple pleasures, like finding wild onions by the side of a road, or requited love.
E: CONT'D and
N: He takes a book from the bookshelf, gives it to her. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 8.
C: BEVERLY

N: OPENING TITLES We're underwater. Light fractures and scatters above. The surface undulating gently as we GLIDE through a lake's dark, tenebrous waters on a moonlit night. A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision. It's aluminum hull cutting through the calm above, sending out small waves as it makes it's way SLOWLY past. Oars dip in on either side, propelling the small craft toward deeper water. It slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch -- And then suddenly, something large hits the surface above, indistinct, exploding the calm, coming towards us, sinking fast as TITLES END -- A SHAPE Prone, silhouetted against a sunlit window across the room. A body, her back to us. The phone RINGS. Once, twice. The body doesn't move. A girl's voice calls from downstairs.
C: JEAN
D: Mom...?
E: OS
N: The phone continues to RING. Still no movement.
C: JEAN
D: Mom...!
E: OS CONT'D
N: Nothing. The ringing stops. A moment of silence, followed by irritated teenage footsteps on the carpeted stairs.
C: JEAN
D: ...Mom...?
E: OS CONT'D
N: The hallway door opens, we're in -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 9.
S: INT. BARBARA'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: JEAN, fourteen, precocious, sticks her head in.
C: JEAN
D: ...Mom?
N: A sound from the body, still no movement.
C: BARBARA
D: Mmm...
C: JEAN
D: You didn't hear the phone?
C: BARBARA
D: If it's your father, tell him to fuck off.
C: JEAN
D: It's Aunt Ivy in Oklahoma.
N: New deal. She sits up. CLOSE ON: BARBARA FORDHAM, late- forties, fully dressed. She gropes for the phone.
C: BARBARA
D: ...Ivy? ...what's wrong?
N: Barb stands, moves slowly to the window. Outside: identical suburban homes, neutral house colors, lawns. We STUDY Barb as she listens. Greying roots, no make-up, a few extra pounds. A woman who, for reasons we don't yet understand, has decided to stop giving a damn.
C: BARBARA
D: ...When...?
E: CONT'D
N: Jean passes in the hall. Stops, watching as her mother slowly dissolves, reaches for the sill, lowers herself to sit.
S: INT/EXT. WESTON HOUSE (PAWHUSKA, OKLAHOMA) - DAY
N: A battered Honda Civic makes it's way up the long drive from the highway below, dust swirling behind it. It's hot. Bright. The Honda parks. IVY WESTON, forties, shy and soft-spoken, attractive enough but expert at hiding it, climbs out. Stares up at the trees surrounding the old farm house. The precarious old barn out back and untended flower beds. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 10.
S: INT. WESTON KITCHEN - DAY
N: Johnna washes a dish at the sink. Watches Ivy's arrival through the kitchen window. Makes no motion to go to her --
S: INT. THE WESTON HOUSE - DAY
N: Ivy steps into the dark house. Drapes drawn, lights off.
C: IVY
D: Mom...? Mom?
E: no answer
N: Steps into the open door of her father's study. His vacant desk chair, untouched papers, dust mots settling in the sunlight. She takes a moment, then heads upstairs. CARRYING US with her. Finds Violet, in her bedroom, sitting in front of her vanity in near darkness, smoking and on the phone.
C: VIOLET
D: ...You've been out there...?
N: Barely acknowledges Ivy's arrival. The room is unruly. Bed unmade. Clothes draped over chairs. Dresser and night-stands cluttered with pills, tissue boxes, creams and lotions.
C: VIOLET
D: ...You're going out yourself...? *
E: CONT'D
N: Ivy wanders into the bath. More pills, wet towels on the floor. She turns off the dripping faucet. Picks up towels.
C: VIOLET
D: Stop that...
E: CONT'D
N: Violet is off the phone, standing in hall, watching Ivy. Ivy stops, briefly chastened. Violet opens a bottle of pills.
C: VIOLET
D: You call Barb? What'd she say?
E: CONT'D
C: IVY
D: She's on her way.
C: VIOLET
D: What'd you tell her?

C: IVY
D: She said she was on her way.
C: VIOLET
D: Goddamn it, Ivy, what did she say?
C: IVY
D: She said she was on her way.
C: VIOLET
D: You're hopeless. Goddamn your father for putting me through this. Seen that office of his, all that mess? I can't make heads or tails of it. He hired this Indian for some goddamn reason and now I have a stranger in my house. What's her name?
E: heads back into her room
N: Ivy follows her mother, returns to tidying up.
C: IVY
D: Johnna. Who was on the phone?
C: VIOLET
D: This house is falling apart, something about the basement or the sump pump or the foundation. I don't know anything about it. I can't do this by myself.
C: IVY
D: I called Karen.
C: VIOLET
D: What did she say?
C: IVY
D: She said she'd try to get here.
C: VIOLET
D: She'll be a big fat help, just like you. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 12.

C: IVY
D: What's Barb going to be able to do?
N: Ivy moves on to hanging clothes back in the jammed closet.
C: VIOLET
D: What did you do to your hair?
C: IVY
D: I had it straightened.
C: VIOLET
D: You had it straightened. Why would anybody do that?
C: IVY
D: I just wanted a change.
C: VIOLET
D: You're the prettiest of my three girls, but you always look like a schlub. Why don't you wear makeup?
C: IVY
D: Do I need makeup?
C: VIOLET
D: All women need makeup. Don't let anybody tell you different. The only woman who was pretty enough to go without makeup was Elizabeth Taylor and she wore a ton. Stand up straight.
C: IVY
D: Mom.
C: VIOLET
D: Your shoulders are slumped and your hair's all straight and you don't wear makeup. You look like a lesbian.
N: Violet takes another pill.
C: VIOLET
D: You could get a decent man if you spruced up. A bit, that's all I'm saying.
E: CONT'D
C: IVY
D: I'm not looking for a man. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 13.
C: VIOLET
D: There are a lot of losers out there, don't think I don't know that. But just because you got a bad one last time doesn't mean --
C: IVY
D: Barry wasn't a loser.
C: VIOLET
D: Barry was an asshole. I warned you from the jump, first time you brought him over here in his little electric car with his stupid orange hair and that turban --
C: IVY
D: It wasn't a turban --
C: VIOLET
D: You work at a college. Don't tell me there aren't people coming through the door of that library every day.
C: IVY
D: You want me to marry some eighteen year old boy from one of these hick towns?
C: VIOLET
D: They still have teachers at TU, right? They did when your father taught there.
N: Violet takes another pill.
C: VIOLET
D: How many was that?

D: You have cancer of the mouth.
C: VIOLET
D: Just leave it alone.
N: IVY * (after a moment) * Are you scared?
C: VIOLET
D: Course I'm scared. And you are a comfort, sweetheart. Thank God one of my girls stayed close to home.
N: Outside, the sound of a CAR pulling up. Ivy pulls back the drape and the shade, finds a big Cadillac arriving.
C: IVY
D: Aunt Mattie Fae's here.
C: VIOLET
D: She means to come in here and tell me what's what.
C: IVY

D: You don't burn a man's books.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: You do, if the situation calls for it.

D: The man's books didn't do anything.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: You get any ideas about just up and taking off, Charlie Aiken, you better believe --
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm not going anywhere.
N: Charlie parks, they climb out into the blinding sunlight.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: I'm saying if you did, I'll give you two days to get your head straight and then it's all going up in a blaze of glory. Not that you have any books lying around. I don't think I've ever seen you read a book in my life.
C: CHARLIE
D: That bother you?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: What's the last book you read?
C: CHARLIE
D: Beverly was a teacher; teachers read books, I'm in the upholstery business.
N: Ivy comes out of the house to meet them. Mattie Fae spots her, makes a beeline for her, envelopes Ivy in a hug.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Ah, sweetie. Your daddy's done this before. Just takes off, no call, nothing. I told your mother, "You pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and have `em waiting for him on the front porch."

D: Kind of like Charles.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yes, like Little Charles. Exactly --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Oh. He's nothing like Little Charles.
C: CHARLIE
D: She just means in their sort of quiet complicated ways --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Little Charles isn't complicated, he's just unemployed.
N: The phone begins to RING. Ivy eyes it apprehensively.
C: CHARLIE
D: He's an observer.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: All he observes is the television. Why is it so dark in here?
E: and

D: So you can't even see Ivy's point? That Little Charles and Beverly share some kind of... complication.

D: You have to be smart to be complicated. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 17.
N: The phone STOPS. Violet's answered it upstairs.

E: CONT'D
C: IVY
D: Been a couple of years now. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 18.
N: Mattie Fae starts peeling off the tape.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Is it that long since we've been here?
C: CHARLIE
D: Do you know its purpose? You can't tell if it's night or day.
C: IVY

N: Barbara and Bill have entered, are quickly descended upon by Mattie Fae and Charlie. Hugs, overlapping dialogue.

C: VIOLET
D: Barb...
C: BARBARA
D: It's okay, Mom. I'm here, I'm here. Shh, it's okay, I'm here.
N: Ivy appears at the top of the stairs, watches her mother in her sister's arms. Bill turns to Charlie, quietly:
C: BILL
D: No word then?
C: CHARLIE MATTIE FAE
D: No. No, huh-uh.
C: VIOLET BARBARA
D: What am I going to do? It's okay, Mom.

C: JEAN
D: O-kay, we've all stared at my tits now.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: They're just so darn big.
N: Vi hugs Jean. Johnna slips in, leaves a beer for Charlie.
C: VIOLET
D: You're just the prettiest thing. Thank you for coming to see me.
C: BARBARA
D: Ivy, I didn't see you up there.
N: Ivy, still standing above on the stairs.
C: IVY
D: It looked crowded.
C: BARBARA
D: God, you look good. Doesn't she look good, Bill?
C: BILL BARBARA
D: Yes, she does. I love your hair, that looks great.
C: VIOLET
D: She had it straightened. Barbara, or Bill, it doesn't matter, I need you to go through Beverly's things, help me with this paperwork.

C: VIOLET
D: You're going back to Tulsa?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: We have to, we left in such a rush we didn't get anyone to take care of the damn dogs. Anyway, I know you want to spend some time with these girls.
C: VIOLET

S: EXT. THE YARD - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Jean steps out onto the porch. Sees Johnna across the road by the fence. Heads for her --
C: JEAN
D: Hi...
N: Johnna is cutting off sprigs of wild mint entangled in the fence, standing in what was once a vegetable garden.
C: JOHNNA
D: Hello.
N: JEAN * I'm Jean. * JOHNNA * Johnna. * Johnna keeps working, Jean watches.
C: JEAN
D: I like your necklace.
N: A beaded pouch in the shape of a turtle. JOHNNA * Thank you. *
C: JEAN
D: Did you make that?
C: JOHNNA
D: My grandma.
C: JEAN
D: Is there something in it?
C: JOHNNA
D: My umbilical cord.
N: Jean recoils. Johnna smiles.
C: JEAN
D: Ewww, are you serious?
C: JOHNNA
D: When a Cheyenne is born, their umbilical cord is dried and sewn into a pouch. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 27.
C: JEAN
D: You're Cheyenne. Like that movie Powwow Highway. Did you see that?
N: JOHNNA * Yes. We wear it for the rest of our * lives. If we lose it, our souls belong nowhere and when we die our souls walk the Earth looking for where we belong. Johnna starts back for the house with her mint. Off Jean --
S: INT. THE BACK PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A screened in back porch off the kitchen. Bill and Barb sit at an old linoleum table.
C: BILL
D: This was when?
N: Violet stands smoking, unhappily watching Charlie and Mattie Fae climb into the Caddie and disappear down the gravel drive, heading back to Tulsa.
C: VIOLET
D: Saturday morning. The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy. We ate some, he walked out the door, this door right there. Got into his truck. And that was it.
N: Johnna enters with her mint, crosses into the kitchen.
C: BARBARA
D: He just left...?
C: VIOLET
D: I went to bed Saturday night, got up Sunday... still no Beverly. I didn't make much of it, thought he'd gone out on a bender.
C: BARBARA
D: Why would he do that? Not like he couldn't drink at home. Unless you were riding his ass.
C: VIOLET
D: I never said anything to him about his drinking, never got on him about it. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 28.
C: BARBARA
D: Really.
C: VILOET
D: Barbara, I swear. He could drink himself into obliv-uh, obliv-en-um...
C: BARBARA
D: Oblivion.
C: BILL
D: So Sunday, still no sign of him...
C: VIOLET
D: Yes, Sunday. No sign. I started getting worried, don'tcha know. That's when I got worked up about that safety deposit box. We kept an awful lot of cash in that box, some expensive jewelry. I had a diamond ring in that box appraised at seven thousand dollars --
N: Johnna returns with glasses of iced tea, each with a sprig of mint, delivers them to Bill and Barbara.
C: BARBARA
D: Wait, wait, wait, I'm missing something. Why do you care about a safety deposit box?
C: VIOLET
D: Well, I know what you'll say about this, but, your father and I had an urge-ment... arrangement. If something were to ever happen to one of us, the other one would go empty that box.
C: BARBARA
D: Because...
C: BILL
D: The money and jewelry gets rolled into the estate, bank seals the box until probate is settled. Can take months.
C: VIOLET
D: Right, that's right --
C: BARBARA
D: You're such a fucking cynic. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 29.
C: VIOLET
D: I knew you would disapprove --
N: Johnna cuts into a freshly baked apple pie in the kitchen.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay, what about the safety deposit box?
C: VIOLET
D: I had to wait for the bank to open on Monday. And after I emptied that box, I called the police and reported him missing. Monday morning.
C: BARBARA
D: And you only had Ivy call me today?
C: VIOLET
D: I didn't want to worry you, honey --
C: BARBARA BILL
D: Jesus Christ. Vi, you sure there wasn't some event that triggered his leaving, some incident.
C: VIOLET
D: You mean like a fight.
E: CONT'D
N: Johnna places pieces of pie in front of Bill and Barb.
C: BILL
D: Yes.
C: VIOLET
D: No. And we fought enough... you know... but no, he just left.
C: BARBARA
D: Maybe he needed some time away from you.
C: VIOLET
D: That's nice of you to say.
C: BARBARA
D: Good old unfathomable Dad.
C: VIOLET
D: Oh. That man. What I first fell of with -- fell in love with, you know, was his mystery. I thought it was sexy as hell. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 30.
E: MORE
C: VIOLET
D: You knew he was the smartest one in the room, knew if he just said something... knock you out. But he'd just stand there, little smile on his face... not say a word. Sexy.
E: CONT'D
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: INSIDE THE KITCHEN Ivy enters with her coffee cup, runs water in it at the sink. Outside, her mother, sister, and Bill on the back porch.
C: BILL
D: You can't think of anything unusual --
N: Johnna sits at the kitchen table behind Ivy. Johnna stands, joins Ivy at the sink. Ivy hadn't seen her there.
C: VIOLET
D: He hired this woman. He didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come live in our house. Few days before he left.
C: BARBARA
D: You don't want her here.
C: VIOLET
D: She's a stranger in my house. There's an Indian in my house.
N: Ivy looks to Johnna, embarrassed. But Johnna just takes Ivy's cup from her, finishes cleaning it.
C: BILL
D: You have a problem with Indians, Violet?
C: VIOLET
D: I don't know what to say to an Indian.
C: BARBARA
D: They're called Native Americans now, Mom.
C: VIOLET
D: Who makes that decision?
C: BARBARA
D: It's what they like to be called. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 31.
C: VIOLET
D: They aren't any more native than me.
C: BARBARA
D: In fact, they are.
C: VIOLET
D: What's wrong with Indian?
C: BARBARA
D: Why's it so hard to call people --
C: VIOLET
D: Let's just call the dinosaurs "Native Americans" while we're at it.
C: BARBARA
D: She may be an Indian, but she makes the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.
N: Johnna smiles, nods to Ivy. Leaves the kitchen.
C: VIOLET
D: He hired a cook. It doesn't make any sense. We don't eat.
C: BARBARA
D: And now you get biscuits and gravy. Kind of nice, huh?
C: VIOLET
D: Nice for you, now. But you'll be gone soon enough, never to return.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom...
E: a warning
C: VIOLET
D: When was the last time you were here?
C: BARBARA VIOLET
D: Don't get started on that -- Really, I don't even remember.
C: BARBARA
D: I'm very dutiful, Mom, I call, I write, I send presents --
C: VIOLET
D: You do not write -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 32.
C: BARBARA
D: Presents on birthdays, Mother's Day --
N: Ivy eavesdrops at the sink, unsure if she should stay or go.
C: VIOLET
D: Because you're "dutiful."
C: BILL
D: All right, now --
C: VIOLET
D: I don't care about you two. I'd like to see my granddaughter every now --
C: BARBARA
D: Well, you're seeing her now.
C: VIOLET
D: But your father. You broke his heart when you moved away.
C: BARBARA
D: That is wildly unfair.
N: Bill stands, picks up a plate, pushes his way back into the kitchen. Ivy hears him coming, but doesn't have time to escape. Goes to the refrigerator instead.
C: BILL VIOLET
D: Am I going to have to You know you were Beverly's separate you two? favorite; don't pretend you don't know that.
N: Barbara follows Bill. Ivy finds iced tea, pours herself some. Tries to make herself invisible -- it's not hard to do.
C: BARBARA
D: I'd prefer to think my parents loved all their children equally.
E: CONT'D
N: Violet trails behind them into the kitchen.
C: VIOLET
D: I'm sure you'd prefer to think that Santy Claus brought you presents at Christmas, too. If you'd had more than one child, you'd know a parent always has favorites. Mattie Fae was my mother's favorite. Big deal. I got used to it. You were your Daddy's favorite. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 33.
N: Barbara notices Ivy, standing there, Christ. This isn't a conversation she'd like to be having in front of her sister. Violet sees Ivy too -- could care less.
C: VIOLET
D: Broke his heart.
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: What was I supposed to do?! Colorado gave Bill twice the money he was making at TU --
C: BILL
D: Why are we even getting into this?
C: BARBARA
D: You think Daddy wouldn't have jumped at the chance Bill got?
C: VIOLET
D: You're wrong there. You never would've gotten Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.
C: BARBARA
D: Daddy gave me his blessing.
C: VIOLET
D: `S what he told you.
C: BARBARA
D: Now you're going to tell me the true story, some terrible shit Daddy said behind my back?
C: BILL
D: Hey, enough. Everybody's on edge --
C: VIOLET
D: Beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back --
C: BILL
D: Vi, come on --
C: VIOLET
D: He just told me he's disappointed in you because you settled. He thought * you had talent, as a writer. *
C: BARBARA
D: Daddy never said anything like that to you. What a load of absolute horseshit. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 34.
C: VIOLET
D: Oh, horseshit, horseshit, let's all say horseshit. Say horseshit, Bill.
C: BILL
D: Horseshit.
N: Violet goes. Barb and Bill exchange a look. Barb looks to Ivy, who's blank. Barb takes a beat, follows Violet.
S: INT. BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Violet is closing the bathroom door. Barb stops her.
C: BARBARA
D: Are you high?
C: VIOLET
D: Excuse me.
C: BARBARA
D: I mean literally. You taking something?
C: VIOLET
D: A muscle relaxer.
C: BARBARA
D: Listen to me: I will not go through this with you again.
C: VIOLET
D: I don't know what you're talking about.
C: BARBARA
D: These fucking pills? Calls at three * AM about people in your backyard?
C: VIOLET
D: Stop yelling at me!
C: BARBARA
D: The police, all the rest of it?
C: VIOLET
D: It's not the same thing. I didn't have a reason.
C: BARBARA
D: So now it's okay to get hooked because you have a reason. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 35.
C: VIOLET
D: I'm not hooked on anything.
C: BARBARA
D: I don't want to know if you are or not, I'm just saying I won't go --
C: VIOLET
D: I'm not. I'm in pain.
C: BARBARA
D: Because of your mouth.
C: VIOLET
D: Yes, because my mouth burns from the chemotheeeahh --
C: BARBARA
D: Are you in a lot of pain?
N: Violet starts to break down, sits on the lidded toilet.
C: VIOLET
D: Yes, I'm in pain. I have got... gotten cancer. In my mouth. And it burns like a... bullshit. And Beverly's disappeared and you're yelling at me.
C: BARBARA
D: I'm not yelling at you.
C: VIOLET
D: You couldn't come home when I got cancer but as soon as Beverly disappeared you rushed back --
C: BARBARA
D: I'm sorry... you're right. I'm sorry.
N: Barbara kneels, takes her mother's hand.
C: BARBARA
D: Know where I think he is? I think he got some whiskey, a carton of cigarettes, and a couple of good spy novels... I think he got out on the boat, steered it to a nice spot, close to shore... and he's fishing, and reading, and drinking, maybe even writing a little. I think he'll walk right through that door any time. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 36.

S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/STAIRS/ATTIC ROOM - TWILIGHT
N: Jean walks down the hall, perusing photos of her ancestors. Rail-thin, sunburned dust bowl farmers, WWII GIs standing in front of battered Packards before shipping out to die on the beaches of Normandy. Violet and Bev on their wedding day. Jean's mother and aunts in grade school, with prom dates. The photos end in a doorway that leads to a narrow, wooden staircase. Jean climbs it to --
S: INT. THE ATTIC BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
N: Finds Johnna on her bed in the small ascetic attic room, reading T.S. Eliot. Jean KNOCKS on the open door.
C: JEAN
D: Hi, again... Am I bugging you?
C: JOHNNA
D: No, do you need something?
C: JEAN
D: No, I thought maybe you'd like to smoke a bowl with me?
C: JOHNNA
D: No, thank you.
C: JEAN
D: Okay. I didn't know. Do you mind if I smoke a bowl?
E: beat
C: JOHNNA
D: I. No, I --
C: JEAN
D: Mom and Dad don't mind. You won't get into trouble or anything.
N: Johnna is clearly a bit uncomfortable. But:
C: JOHNNA
D: Okay.
C: JEAN
D: Okay. You sure?
N: From her pocket, Jean takes a glass pipe and a bud. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 37.
C: JEAN
D: I say they don't mind. If they knew I smuggled this on the plane? And sat there sweating like in that movie Midnight Express. Did you see that?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHNNA
D: I don't think so.
C: JEAN
D: I just mean they don't mind that I smoke pot. Mom kind of does. I think cause Dad smokes pot too, and she wishes he didn't. You sure?
E: smokes, offers pipe
C: JOHNNA
D: Yes. No. I'm fine.
N: Jean notices a framed photo on the night stand.
C: JEAN
D: Wow, are those your parents?
C: JOHNNA
D: Mm-hm, their wedding picture.
C: JEAN
D: Their costumes are fantastic. Are they still together?
C: JOHNNA
D: My father passed away last year.
C: JEAN
D: Oh. Sorry.
C: JOHNNA
D: That's okay. Thank you.
C: JEAN
D: Were you close?
C: JOHNNA
D: Yes. Very.
C: JEAN
D: My Mom and Dad are separated now.
C: JOHNNA
D: I'm sorry. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 38.
C: JEAN
D: He's fucking one of his grad students. I don't care --aside from the pathetic English and Humanities cliche, like all those departmental dicks fucking their students -- he can fuck who he wants and that's who teachers meet, students. He was just a turd the way he didn't give Mom a chance to respond or anything. What sucks now is she's on my ass cause she's afraid I'll have some post-divorce freak-out and become some heroin addict or shoot everybody at school. Or God forbid, lose my virginity. I don't know what it is about Dad splitting that put Mom on hymen patrol. Don't say anything about Mom and Dad; okay? They want to play it low key.

S: A27 INT. BEVERLY'S STUDY - NIGHT A27
N: Bill stands in Beverly's empty study. Absorbing the room, the man, the stillness. Picks at the papers on the desk without specific purpose. Turns to one of the many bookcases, eventually finds a book, smiles.
S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
N: Barbara sits on the front steps. It's dark now, but still very hot. Moths bat at the porch lights. Bill comes out * carrying a Coke, shares it with Barb. *
C: BILL
D: Ivy leave?
C: BARBARA
D: I'd forgotten about the lightning bugs.
E: she nods
N: Around the yard, flitting in and out of the low hanging boughs of the trees.
C: BILL
D: Look what I found...
N: She turns, he holds a thin hardback copy of Meadowlark. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 39.
C: BARBARA
D: We have copies.
C: BILL
D: I don't remember a hardback edition. Think this is worth something... first edition, hardback, mint condition? Academy Fellowship, Wallace Stevens Award? This book was a big deal.
C: BARBARA
D: It wasn't that big a deal.
C: BILL
D: In those circles, it was.
C: BARBARA
D: Those are small circles.
N: He opens the book, perusing the first pages. Reads.
C: BILL
D: "Dedicated to my Violet." That's nice. Christ, probably every word he wrote after this he had to be thinking, "What are they going to say, are they going to compare it to Meadowlark?"
C: BARBARA
D: Jean go to bed?
C: BILL
D: Just turned out the light. You'd think at some point, you just write something anyway and who cares what they say about it. I don't know --
C: BARBARA
D: Will you shut up about that fucking book?! You are just dripping with envy over these thirty poems my father wrote back in the late sixties, for God's sake. Y'hear yourself?
N: Bill's taken aback, but doesn't want to overreact.
C: BILL
D: I have great admiration for these poems -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 40.
C: BARBARA
D: My father didn't write anymore for a lot of reasons, but critical opinion was not one of them, hard as that may be for you to believe.
C: BILL
D: What are you attacking me for? I haven't done anything.
C: BARBARA
D: I'm sure that's what you tell Sissy, too, so she can comfort you, reassure you, "No, Billy, you haven't done anything."
C: BILL
D: Why are you bringing that up?
C: BARBARA
D: They're all symptoms of your male menopause, whether it's you struggling with the "creative question," or screwing a girl who still wears a retainer.
C: BILL
D: All right, look, I'm not going to be held hostage here while you attack me. And her name is Cindy.
C: BARBARA
D: I know her stupid name -- do me the courtesy of recognizing when I'm demeaning you.
C: BILL
D: Violet really has a way of putting you in attack mode, you know that? You feel such rage for her you can't help dishing it --
C: BARBARA
D: Psychoanalyze me right now, I skin you.
C: BILL
D: You may not agree with my methods, but you know I'm right -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 41.
C: BARBARA
D: "Your methods." Thank you, Doctor, but I actually don't need any help from my mother to feel rage.
C: BILL
D: You want to argue? Is that what you need to do? Pick a subject, alright, let me know what it is, so I have a fighting --
C: BARBARA
D: The subject is me! I am the subject, you narcissistic motherfucker! I am in pain! I need help!
N: Barbara heads into the yard to get away from him.

N: Jean's on the small bed in the darkened room. Staring at the ceiling, listening to her parents argue.
S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
N: Bill chases Barbara into the yard.
C: BILL
D: I've copped to being a narcissist. We're the products of a narcissistic generation.
C: BARBARA
D: You can't do it, can you? You can't talk about me for two seconds --
C: BILL
D: You called me a narcissist!
C: BARBARA
D: You do understand that it hurts, to go from sharing a bed with you for twenty-three years to sleeping by myself.
C: BILL
D: I'm here, now. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 42.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, men always say shit like that, as if the past and the future don't exist.
N: Jean listens in the dark to her parents fighting -- as she has many times before. Heads out into the hallway to screen door leading to the upstairs porch.
C: BARBARA
D: It's just horseshit, to avoid talking about the things they're afraid to say.
E: CONT'D
C: BILL
D: I'm not necessarily keen on the notion of saying things that would hurt you.
C: BARBARA
D: Like what?
C: BILL
D: We have enough on our hands with your parents right now, let's not revisit this.
C: BARBARA
D: When did we visit this to begin with? I still don't know what happened. Do I bore you, intimidate you, disgust you? Is this just about the pleasures of young flesh, teenage pussy? I really need to know.
C: BILL
D: You need to know now? With Beverly missing, and your mother crazy as a loon? You want to do this now?
C: BARBARA
D: You're right. I'll just hunker down for a cozy night's sleep upstairs. Next to my husband.
C: BILL
D: This discussion deserves our care. And patience. We'll both be in a better frame of mind to talk about this once your father's come home.
N: Bill turns, starts back for the house. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 43.
S: INT. WESTON HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Jean sees her father coming, hears his footsteps approaching across the wooden porch below, the screen door opens quietly. She slips back into her room and bed, but he doesn't stop. Jean waits, listening for her mother. She doesn't come.
S: EXT. SKIATOOK LAKE - NIGHT
N: We're on the old wooden dock, watching a man walking away from us toward an aluminum rowboat tied haphazardly to the dock in the moonlight. He leans down to untie the boat, looks back at us, directly into camera -- Beverly. Now we're traveling BELOW the surface of the lake, through its dark, tenebrous waters on the moonlit night. The rhythmic SLAP of gentle waves. We're underwater, light fractures and scatters above us. We've been here before as -- A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision. It's aluminum bottom cuts through the calm above. Oars dip on either side, propelling the small craft. It slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch -- Until, suddenly, something hits the surface above, exploding the calm, coming at us fast, sinking.
S: INT. THE ATTIC - NIGHT
N: Johnna wakes with a start. Sits up, listens intently.
S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Johnna steps out onto the second floor porch balcony, finds a police car approaching in the distance, headlights cutting through the dark country night.
S: 34/35 INT. WESTON HOUSE STAIRWAY - NIGHT 34/35
N: Barefoot, Johnna quietly descends the stairs. Approaches the front door, left open to let in the cool night air. Undoes the screen door latch. Steps outside. Watches the car arrive. The driver's door opens, a sheriff gets out, silhouetted against the police flashers behind him. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 44.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Barbara, bleary-eyed, moves quickly down the dark hall in her robe. Bill follows in his boxers and T-shirt, pulling on pants. Barb goes to Vi's door, KNOCKS.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom?
N: She opens the door. Over her we FIND: Violet, entombed in her room. Squinting against the intrusive hall light.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom, wake up, the sheriff's here.
E: CONT'D

D: Inna esther broke. `N pays me `em...sturck...struck.

D: Go back to bed, sweetheart....
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara descends the stairs, trailed by Bill. The SHERIFF waits on the porch, late-forties, handsome, Stetson in hand. They go to him, but WE HANG BACK with Jean, watching the scene outside unfold. Bill shakes the Sheriff's hand. The Sheriff speaks earnestly to Barbara and Bill. We can't hear what's being said, only murmurs until -- Barbara sinks to her knees. Bill holds her. Jean watches. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 45.
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Johnna enters, snaps on the light, starts a pot of coffee. Stoic, inscrutable.
S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE DRIVEWAY - JUST BEFORE DAWN
N: A big pre-dawn sky is changing from black to blue. The Sheriff walks to his cruiser, kills the flashers. Bill joins him, still barefoot.
C: BILL
D: What happened?
C: SHERIFF
D: Couple old boys running jug lines in the lake hooked him. Pulled him up.
C: BILL
D: He drowned. That's how he died, from drowning?
C: SHERIFF
D: Looks it. Yes, sir.
N: Bill looks off. Song birds begin their pre-dawn chatter.
C: BILL
D: Is there any way to determine if he... I mean is this an accident, or suicide --?
C: SHERIFF
D: There's really no way to tell.
C: BILL
D: What's your guess?
C: SHERIFF
D: ...Suicide.
N: And now the full weight of it hits Bill. After a moment --
C: BILL
D: How does a a person jump in the water... and choose not to swim?
S: INT. WESTON GIRL'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
N: Barb pulls on clothes, rakes a brush through her hair. Jean appears in the door, watches her. After a moment: "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 46.
C: JEAN
D: What about Aunt Ivy?
C: BARBARA
D: I guess we'll stop on the way. Christ, I need to call Karen, too. Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?
N: She drops the brush. And then an odd sound intrudes from downstairs, a song: "Lay Down, Sally" by Eric Clapton.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - PRE-DAWN
N: The music is LOUD. We follow Barbara and Jean halfway down the stairs to REVEAL: Violet, high as a kite, doing a jerky little dance by the stereo. The Sheriff stands uncomfortably by the door, his hat in hand. She shuffles over to him.
C: VIOLET
D: Izza story. Barely's back. Did sum Beer-ley come home?
C: SHERIFF
D: Ma'am?
C: VIOLET
D: Gizza cig... some cigezze? Cig-zezz, cig-zizz... cig-uhzzz...
N: She laughs at her inability to speak. He takes a Pall Mall from his shirt pocket, hands it to her. Lights it for her.
C: VIOLET
D: In the archa, archa-tex? I'm in the bottom. Inna bottom of them. Mm, good beat, right?
E: CONT'D and
N: He nods. Bill comes back in from outside.
C: VIOLET
D: Barbara?! Is Barbara here?!
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: Right here, Mom...
E: quietly
N: Johnna steps in from the kitchen, pensively observing.
C: VIOLET
D: Mm, good beat, right? Idn't it's a good beat? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 47.
E: MORE
C: VIOLET
D: Mmmm, I been on the music... pell man onna sheriff. Armen in tandel s'lossle, s'lost? Lost?! From the day, the days. Am Beerly... and Beverly lost?
E: CONT'D
N: Violet abandons her dance, separates invisible threads in the air. The others stand frozen, staring at her.
C: VIOLET
D: And then you're here. And Barbara, and then you're here, and Beverly, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here, and then you're here...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. SKIATOOK LAKE ROAD - DAWN
N: The sun's just topped the horizon, throws long early shadows across the flat expanse of prairie. Scattered trees, a ribbon of asphalt leading to a distant lake, telephone poles. We're HIGH ABOVE the country road, following the Sheriff cruiser below. Barb's rental sedan trails behind.
C: BARBARA
D: I used to go out with that boy. That man.
E: OS
S: INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - EARLY MORNING
N: Bill drives, Ivy up front with him. Barbara sits in the back with Jean. Watches the sheriff's car ahead.
C: JEAN
D: What man? The Sheriff?
C: BARBARA
D: In high school. He was my prom date.
C: JEAN
D: You're kidding.
C: BARBARA
D: Day of the prom, his father got drunk and stole his car, stole his own son's car, went somewhere, Mexico. Deon showed up at the door. He'd been crying. Confessed he didn't have a way to take me to the prom. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 48.
N: The cruiser slows, pulls through a pipe gate and over a cattle-crossing, heads for a small collection of emergency vehicles parked around a brush-strewn cove. Bev's old Chevy pick-up truck sits to one side.
C: BARBARA
D: So we got a six-pack and broke into the chapel, stayed up all night talking and kissing. Now here he is, showing me -- It's so surreal. Thank God we can't tell the future. We'd never get out of bed.
E: CONT'D fights her emotions
N: The cars stop. The Sheriff gets out.
C: BILL
D: Let me go first, see what they need.
N: Bill goes. Barb fixes Jean with a look.
C: BARBARA
D: Listen to me: die after me, all right? I don't care what else you do, where you go, how you screw up your life, just... survive. Outlive me, please.
N: They watch the men. A resolute Bill returns to get Barbara and Ivy. The sisters climb out, follow him to the water's edge. Jean waits a moment, then steps out of the car. Watches her father lead her mother down the small cracked concrete boat ramp to where the Sheriff waits by a covered body. As the Sheriff pulls back the tarp --
S: INT. A STERILE ROOM - DAY
N: White walls, bright overhead light. We're CLOSE on a man's pale, lifeless hand. Another hand enters frame with a sponge, begins cleaning off the mud, filth.
S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY
N: The Weston clan walks to Beverly's Lincoln, Bill, Jean. Barb and Ivy help a distraught Violet. All wear mourning black.
S: INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY
N: Beverly's sodden shoes are removed, his socks. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 49. His limp, greyish arm is guided into a starched white shirt- sleeve. The buttons carefully buttoned.
S: INT. BEVERLY'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY
N: Bill drives. Jean beside him. Barbara and Ivy sit in the back seat, flanking Violet. They ride in silence. We study their faces, the brown countryside outside. Bill notices something in his rearview, a red speck, coming up fast, very fast. A sports car. It's suddenly right behind them, filling his mirrors. It waits for a semi loaded down with massive circular hay bales to pass in the opposite lane, then -- ROARS around. A Ferrari, it's throaty V-10 RUMBLING as it SCREAMS past, accelerates down the road. Bill and Jean exchange a look, watch it disappear.
S: INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY
N: Strong male hands lift Beverly's now dressed body carefully and place it into the casket. Adjust the pillow, comb his hair into place, fold his hands across his chest. We never see his face, never see his whole body. Only these small, intimate pieces.
S: INT/EXT. CAR/FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF PAWHUSKA - DAY
N: A few mourners enter the church as Bill pulls in to park, discovers the Ferrari already there. A woman emerging.
C: BARBARA
D: Holy shit, that's Karen.
N: KAREN WESTON, forty, lithe, climbing from the car.
C: BARBARA
D: Do you remember your Aunt Karen?
E: CONT'D
C: JEAN
D: Kind of...
N: STEVE HEIDEBRECHT, fifty, greying, athletic, tan and handsome, gets out of the driver's side. BARBARA * That must be this year's man. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 50. Mattie Fae and Charlie are waiting for them, start over as Violet emerges into the blinding sun. Recoils slightly. Mattie Fae catches her, whispers comforts into her ear, helps her toward the church steps. We stay back, watching the Westons enter the church --
C: KAREN
D: I spent so much time in our bedroom pretending my pillow was my husband and did he like the dinner I made and where were we going to vacation that winter and he'd surprise me with tickets to Belize and we'd kiss.
E: VO
S: INT. BEVERLY'S LINCOLN (MOVING) - AFTERNOON
N: Barbara drives, Karen beside her. Heat radiates off the road. They follow Charlie's Caddie, Vi and Ivy visible in the Caddie's back seat window ahead of us.
C: KAREN
D: I mean I'd kiss my pillow, and then I'd tell him I'd been to the doctor that day and I'd found out I was pregnant. I know how pathetic that sounds, but it was innocent enough. Then real life takes over, cause it always does --
C: BARBARA
D: -- uh-huh --
N: Here comes the red speck in the rearview again. The Ferrari ROARS up behind them, pulls around to pass, HONKS as it goes. Barb catches a glimpse of Jean in the passenger seat, Bill jammed into the tiny back seat.
C: KAREN
D: Things don't work out like you planned. That pillow was a better husband than any real man I'd ever met; this parade of men fails to live up to your expectations, all of them so much less than Daddy or Bill. You punish yourself, tell yourself it's your fault you can't find a good one. I don't know how well you remember Andrew...
C: BARBARA
D: No, I remember. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 51.
C: KAREN
D: I loved him so intensely, so the things he did wrong were just opportunities for me to make things right. If he cheated on me or called me a cunt, I'd think "No, love is forever, so here's an opportunity to make an adjustment in the way you view the world."
N: The AC isn't working, Barb's sweating, rolls down her window, let's the wind whip her hair around.
C: KAREN
D: And thank God one day I looked in the mirror and said, "Moron," and walked out, but it kicked off this whole period of reflection, how hard I had screwed it up, where'd I go wrong. That's when I got into those books and discussion groups --
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: And Scientology too, right, or something like that --?
C: KAREN
D: Exactly, and finally one day, I threw it all out, I said, "It's me, just me with my music on the stereo, my glass of wine and Bloomers my cat. I don't need anything else, I can live my life with myself." I got my license, threw myself into my work, sold a lot of houses, and that's when I met Steve.
N: Charlie slows, signals, turns onto the gravel road leading to the Weston house. Barb follows, Karen still going strong --
C: KAREN
D: That's how it works, you only find it when you're not looking, you turn around and there it is: Steve. Ten years older than me, but a thinker, and he's just so good. He's a good man and he's good to me and he's good for me.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. WESTON HOUSE STAIRWAY/UPSTAIRS HALL - AFTERNOON
N: Barbara leads Karen upstairs, Karen carries her suitcase, Barbara carries Steve's. Karen's still talking. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 52.
C: KAREN
D: The best thing about him, for me, is that now what I think about is now. I live now. My focus, my life, my world is now. I don't give a care about the past anymore, the mistakes I made, the way I thought. And you can't plan the future cause as soon as you do, something happens, some terrible thing happens --
C: BARBARA
D: Like your father drowning himself.
N: They enter a bedroom, dump the luggage on the bed.
C: KAREN
D: That's exactly what I mean. You take it as it comes, here and now! Steve had a huge presentation today for some big-wig government guys who could be important for his business, something he's put together for months, and as soon as we heard about Daddy, he cancelled his meeting. He has his priorities straight. And you know what the kicker is? Do you know what the kicker --?
E: beat
N: Barbara heads for the fan on the dresser, flips it on.
C: BARBARA
D: What's the kicker?
C: KAREN
D: We're going to Belize on our honeymoon!
N: Barb sticks her face into the fan. Karen watches, what?
C: BARBARA
D: Sorry. Hot flash.
S: INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Violet pulls a dress from the closet; Mattie Fae sits, rooting through a box of photos; Ivy stands by the door.
C: VIOLET
D: It won't kill you to try it on -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 53.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Oh, this is a sweet one, Vi --
C: IVY
D: I find this a tidge morbid, frankly --
C: MATTIE FAE VIOLET
D: Look at this, Ivy -- What's morbid about it?
C: IVY
D: It's not my style, Mom.
E: CONT'D
C: VIOLET
D: You don't have a style, that's the point.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Where was this taken?
C: VIOLET
D: New York. On the first book tour.
C: IVY
D: I don't have your style, I have a style of my own.
C: VIOLET
D: You wore a suit to your father's funeral. A woman doesn't wear a suit to a funeral.
C: IVY
D: God, you're weird; it's a black suit.
C: VIOLET
D: You look like a magician's assistant.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Little Charles has been talking about moving to New York. Can you picture that?
C: VIOLET
D: Don't discourage him now --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: He wouldn't last a day in that city. They'd tear him apart.
C: MATTIE FAE IVY
D: I could kill that kid -- Why do you feel it necessary to insult me? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 54.
E: CONT'D
C: VIOLET
D: Stop being so sensitive.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: He overslept? For his Uncle's funeral? A noon service?
C: IVY
D: I'm sure there's more to the story --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Don't make excuses for him. That's what Charlie does. Thirty-seven years old and can't drive? Who can't drive?
N: Violet pulls more and more clothes from the closet, dumping them on the bed. The pile is getting very large.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: I've seen a chimp drive.
E: CONT'D
C: IVY
D: Why are you giving away your clothes?
C: VIOLET
D: All this shit's going. I don't plan to spend the rest of my days looking at what used to be. I want that shit in the office gone, I want these clothes I'm never going to wear gone. I mean look at these fucking shoes -- Even if I didn't fall on my face, can you imagine anything less attractive, my swollen ankles and varicose veins? And my toenails, good God: anymore they could dig through cement.
E: holds up spiked heels
S: INT. THE KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
N: Johnna's at the sink, washing and breaking beans, every kitchen surface is covered with the large dinner she's preparing. Barbara enters, Karen still pursuing her.
C: KAREN
D: You get a read off Steve? Did you like him?
C: BARBARA
D: We said two words to each other -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 55.
C: KAREN
D: You get a feel, though, don't you? Did you get a feel?
C: BARBARA
D: He seemed very nice, sweetheart --
N: Barb grabs a glass from the cabinet, opens the freezer for ice, lets her head linger in the cold.
C: KAREN
D: He is, and --
C: BARBARA
D: -- but what I think doesn't matter. I'm not marrying him --
C: KAREN
D: I guess what I'm telling you is that I'm happy. I've been unhappy most of my life, my adult life. I doubt you've been aware of that. I know our lives have led us apart, you, me and Ivy. Maybe we're not as close as, as close as some families --
N: Barb gives up on the freezer, fills her glass with iced tea.
C: BARBARA
D: Yeah, we really need to talk about Mom, what to do about Mom --
C: KAREN
D: -- but I think I haven't wanted to live my unhappiness in view of my family. But now I'm just really happy. I'd like us to get to know each other a little better.
N: Barbara stares at her, what is she talking about?
C: BARBARA
D: Yes. Yes.
N: Karen wraps her arms around Barbara.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay. Yes. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 56.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. PAWHUSKA LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
N: The Ferrari pulls into the lot. Bill crawls out, heads for the store. An anxious Jean calls after him.
C: JEAN
D: Hurry, okay?
C: BILL
D: I will, sweetheart.
N: Steve joins Jean, leans against the car. Throughout the following they watch Bill shop for wine inside.
C: STEVE
D: Is it always this hot?
C: JEAN
D: Usually it's hotter.
C: STEVE
D: Hard to imagine. How old are you, about, seventeen?
E: a beat
C: JEAN
D: Fourteen.
C: STEVE
D: Fourteen, right... Know what I was doing when I was fourteen? Cattle processing. Know what that is?
C: JEAN
D: It doesn't sound good.
C: STEVE
D: Slaughterhouse sanitation.
C: JEAN
D: That's disgusting.
C: STEVE
D: I don't recommend it. But hey. Put food on the table. Get it?
N: An impatient Jean watches her father comparing wines inside.
C: STEVE
D: What's that smell?
E: CONT'D
N: She sniffs. Doesn't smell much of anything really. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 57.
C: JEAN
D: Dumpster over there?
C: STEVE
D: Nah, that's not what I'm smelling.
N: He sniffs the air, then sniffs her.
C: JEAN
D: What are you doing?
C: STEVE
D: Do I smell what I think I smell?
C: JEAN
D: What do you smell?
C: STEVE
D: What do you think I smell?
C: JEAN
D: I think you smell that dumpster.
N: He whiffs, hard, breathing her in.
C: STEVE
D: Is that... pot? You smoking pot?
C: JEAN
D: No.
C: STEVE
D: You can tell me.
C: JEAN
D: No.
C: STEVE
D: You a little dope smoker? Then you are in luck. Because I just happen to have some tasty shit. And I am going to hook you up.
E: beat
N: Bill pays inside, motions to Jean that he's hurrying.
C: JEAN
D: That'd be so great. I just smoked my last bowl and I really need to get fucked up.
C: STEVE
D: You what? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 58.
C: JEAN
D: I really need to get fucked up --
C: STEVE
D: You need to get what?
C: JEAN
D: You're bad --
N: Bill hustles out of the store, carrying several bags.
C: BILL
D: No Pinots, but they had some decent California Merlots.
N: Crawls into the car. Steve grins to Jean over the roof of the car, climbs in behind the wheel.
S: INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: The closet is mostly empty now, the bed overflowing with discarded clothes. Mattie Fae nurses a cocktail, hands a * photo to Violet.
C: VIOLET
D: Look at me. Look at me.
E: shows photo to Ivy
C: IVY
D: You're beautiful, Mom.
C: VIOLET
D: I was beautiful. Not anymore.
C: MATTIE FAE IVY
D: Oh, now -- You're still beautiful.
C: VIOLET
D: One of those lies we tell to give us comfort. Women are beautiful when they're young and not after. Men can still preserve their sex appeal into old age. Not those men like you see with shorts and those little purses around their waists. Some men can maintain a weary masculinity. Women just get old and fat and wrinkly.
E: CONT'D
C: MATTIE FAE
D: I beg your pardon? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 59.
C: VIOLET
D: Think about the last time you went to the mall and saw some sweet little gal and thought she's a cute trick. What makes her that way? Taut skin, firm boobs, an ass above her knees.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: I'm still very sexy, thank you very much.
C: VIOLET
D: You're about as sexy as a wet card- board box, Mattie Fae, you and me both. Look, wouldn't we be better off if we stopped lying about these things and told the truth? "Women aren't sexy when they're old." I can live with that. Can you live with that?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: What about Sophia Loren? What about Lena Horne? She stayed sexy till she was eighty.
N: Violet finds something else in the closet for Ivy to try.
C: VIOLET
D: The world is round. Get over it. Now try this dress on.
C: IVY
D: I'm sorry, I won't.
C: VIOLET
D: You don't know how to attract a man. I do. That's something I always --
C: IVY
D: We just buried my father, I'm not trying to attract --!
C: VIOLET
D: I'm not talking about today, dummy, this is something you can wear --
C: IVY
D: I have a man. All right? I have a man.
C: VIOLET
D: You said you weren't looking for a man -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 60.
C: IVY
D: And I'm not. Because I have one. Okay? Now will you leave it alone?
C: VIOLET MATTIE FAE
D: No, I won't leave it alone. No, let's not leave it alone.
C: IVY
D: I wish you both could see the brainsick looks on your faces --
E: CONT'D
C: VIOLET
D: Who is it?
C: IVY
D: Nobody. Forget it --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Tell us, is he someone from school? How old is he, what's he do --?
C: IVY
D: I'm not telling you anything so --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: You have to tell us something!
C: IVY
D: No, I really don't.
C: VIOLET
D: Are you in love, Ivy?
C: IVY
D: I...I don't...I'm...
N: Ivy bursts into awkward laughter, Vi and Mattie squeal.
S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: The Ferrari ROARS up the drive. Jean jumps out, races into the house. Bill and Steve emerge, grab the wine.
C: STEVE
D: No, we maintain the accounts off- shore, just until we get approvals.
C: BILL
D: To get around approvals? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 61.
C: STEVE
D: To get around approvals until we get approvals. There's a lot of red tape, bureaucracy, I don't know how much you know about Florida, Florida politics --
C: BILL
D: Only what I read and that's --
C: STEVE
D: Right, right, this kind of business in particular.
N: Charlie, keys in hand, comes out, heading for his Caddie.
C: BILL
D: ...Charlie?
C: CHARLIE
D: Picking up Little Charles.
N: Charlie climbs in behind the wheel, pulls away.
C: STEVE
D: Little Charles?
C: BILL
D: His son. I'm sorry, what is your * business again?
N: They start up the porch steps with the wine.
C: STEVE
D: You know, it's essentially security work. The situation in the Middle East is perpetually dangerous, so there's a tremendous amount of money involved.
C: BILL
D: Security work. You mean... mercenary?
S: INT. KITCHEN/WESTON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Bill and Steve enter. Barbara's in the dining room with Karen and Mattie Fae setting the table. Goes for the men.
C: BARBARA
D: Give. Me. The wine.
N: She pulls a bottle of Merlot from Bill's grocery bag. Hears something, looks into the living room as she passes. Jean has just turned on the TV, LOUD. Barbara stares for a beat. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 62.
C: BARBARA
D: Is that what you were in such a hurry to get home for? What the hell's on TV that's so important you?
E: CONT'D
C: JEAN
D: Phantom of the Opera, 1925.
C: BARBARA
D: For God's sake, you can get it at any Blockbuster.
C: JEAN
D: They're showing it with the scene in color restored.
N: Steve's appeared in the living room archway.
C: STEVE
D: Cool.
C: BARBARA
D: Let me make sure I've got this: when you threw a fit about going to the store with your dad... Hey, look at me. And you were so distraught over the start time of your Grandpa's funeral. Was this your concern? Getting back here in time to watch Phantom of the Fucking Opera?
E: Jean does
C: JEAN
D: I guess.
N: Barb gives Jean a withering look, exits. Bill takes the wine from Steve, follows. Steve lingers, watching the TV.
C: STEVE
D: Phantom of the Opera, huh?
C: JEAN
D: Huh-uh.
N: Karen enters from the dining room, sidles up to Steve.
C: KAREN
D: Hi, doodle.
C: STEVE
D: Hey, baby. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 63.
E: focused on the TV
C: KAREN
D: Hi, doodle!
E: in super-baby-voice
N: Steve turns to her, embraces her. They kiss. His hands wander, squeeze her ass. She giggles, then breaks it.
C: KAREN
D: Come on, I want to show you our old fort. Man, the air in here just doesn't move.
E: CONT'D
N: She goes. He starts, but stops. Quietly to Jean:
C: STEVE
D: Hook you up, later.
S: INT/EXT. GREYHOUND BUS/PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
N: We're inside the bus, sitting next to a man, LITTLE CHARLES, thirty-seven, rangy and awkward. He stares pensively out at the passing Pawhuska storefronts as the bus SLOWS, pulls into a parking lot next to the bank. He spots Charlie, waiting, drinking a Coke. Little Charles exhales, stands. Steps reluctantly out into the heat.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I'm sorry, Dad.
C: CHARLIE
D: No need to apologize.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I know Mom's mad at me.
C: CHARLIE
D: Don't worry about her.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: What did she say?
C: CHARLIE
D: Your mother, she says what she says.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I set the alarm. I did.
C: CHARLIE
D: I know you did. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 64.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I loved Uncle Bev, you know that.
C: CHARLIE
D: Stop apologizing.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: The power must've gone out. I woke up and the clock was blinking noon. That means the power went out, right?
C: CHARLIE
D: It's okay.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I missed his funeral!
C: CHARLIE
D: It's a ceremony. It's ceremonial. It doesn't mean anything compared to what you have in your heart. Hold on, comb your hair.
E: and, then
N: Charlie hands Little Charles his comb.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: Uncle Bev must be disappointed in me.
C: CHARLIE
D: Your Uncle Bev has got bigger and better things ahead of him. He doesn't have time for spite. He wasn't that kind of man anyway --
N: Charlie starts for the driver's side, stops when he sees Little Charles weeping. Returns to him, comforts him.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay, now...
E: CONT'D
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: Just... I know how things are. I know how they feel about me and something like this... you want to be there for people, and I missed Uncle Bev's funeral, and I know how they feel about me --
C: CHARLIE
D: How who feels about you? Feels what about you? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 65.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: All of them. I know what they say.
C: CHARLIE
D: They don't say things about you --
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I see how they are. I don't blame them. I'm sorry I let you down, Dad.
C: CHARLIE
D: You haven't let me down. You never let me down. Now listen...you're wrong about these people, they love you.

D: Phantom of the Opera --
C: BILL
D: You don't remember what it was like to be fourteen?

D: That's a shot across my bow, right? I missed something. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 66.

D: And you really haven't been much of a parent lately, so it's tough to --
C: BILL
D: Just because you and I are struggling with this Gordian knot doesn't mean --
C: BARBARA
D: Nice, "Gordian knot," but her fourteen- year-old self might view it differently, might consider it "abandonment" --
C: BILL
D: Oh, come on, she's a little more sophisticated than that, don't you think?
N: Barbara kicks at an old, stuck, door. Enters --

D: I have not forsook my responsibilities!
N: Barbara hands dusty battered chairs back to Bill.

D: Our kid is just trying to deal with this goddamn madhouse you've dragged her into.
C: BARBARA
D: This madhouse is my home.
C: BILL
D: Think about that statement for a second, why don't you?
C: BARBARA
D: Jean is here with me because this is a family event.
C: BILL
D: Jean's here with you because she's a buffer between you and the shrill insanity of your mother.
C: BARBARA
D: Y'know, you'd have a lot more credibility if you had any credibility.
C: BILL
D: You can't resist, can you?
C: BARBARA
D: You're a pretty easy mark.
C: BILL
D: You're so goddamn self-righteous, you know? You're so --
C: BARBARA
D: Surely you must've known when you started porking Pippi Longstocking you were due for a little self- righteousness, just a smidge of indignation on my part --
C: BILL
D: Maybe I split because of it.
N: They've reached the back porch stairs. She turns on him.
C: BARBARA
D: Is this your confession, then, when you finally unload all? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 69.
C: BILL
D: You're thoughtful, Barbara, but you're not open. You're passionate, but you're hard. You're a good, decent, funny, wonderful woman, and I love you, but you're a pain in the ass.
N: Bill pushes past her up the stairs, disappears inside.

N: Violet smiles ruefully, takes another pill.
C: VIOLET
D: For the girls, God love `em.

E: OS
N: She takes a final look around, takes one last pill. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 70.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Johnna, Karen, Steve and Mattie Fae carry in serving dishes, set them down on the already overladen table. Charlie pours himself a sweet tea.

C: IVY
D: Please. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 71.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I know you had one of the worst days of your life and I'm sorry if I --

N: She embraces him, kisses him. He looks toward the house.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: You're breaking our rule.
C: IVY
D: They're on to me. Not us, just me. I told them I was seeing someone. I didn't tell them who. I just wanted you to know, in case it came up. What? Charles...

N: Ad-lib greetings, hugs, handshakes, Karen's introduction of Steve. Ivy slips in and takes her seat. Little Charles goes to put Mattie Fae's casserole on the table, but drops it. It lands on the floor with a sickening SPLAT.

C: MATTIE FAE KAREN
D: That's nice. That's sweet.
C: VIOLET
D: I see you gentlemen have stripped down to your shirt fronts. I thought we were having a funeral dinner, not a cockfight.
N: An awkward beat. The men glumly put their suit coats back on.
C: VIOLET
D: Someone should probably say grace. Barbara?
E: CONT'D no response
C: BARBARA
D: Uncle Charlie should say it. He's the patriarch around here now.

D: That sideboard there, you have any interest in that? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 75.
C: BARBARA
D: This? Well... no. I mean, why?
C: VIOLET
D: I'm getting rid of a lot of this stuff and I thought you might want that sideboard.
C: BARBARA
D: No, Mom, I... I wouldn't have any way to get that home to Colorado.
C: KAREN
D: Really pretty.
C: VIOLET
D: Mm. Maybe Ivy'll take it.
C: IVY
D: I have something like that, remember --
C: VIOLET
D: Clearing all this out of here. I want to have a brand new everything.

C: KAREN LITTLE CHARLES
D: It's so good -- Yes, it is --
C: IVY
D: You like your food, Mom?

D: I haven't tried much of it, yet --
C: BARBARA
D: Johnna cooked this whole meal by herself.
C: VIOLET
D: `S what she's paid for.
N: A silent moment. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 76.
C: VIOLET
D: Y'all did know she's getting paid, right?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Jean, so I'm curious, when you say you don't eat meat, you mean you don't eat meat of any kind?
C: JEAN
D: Right.
C: CHARLIE
D: And is that for health reasons, or...?
C: JEAN
D: When you eat meat, you ingest an animal's fear.
C: VIOLET
D: Ingest what? It's fur?
C: JEAN
D: Fear.
C: VIOLET
D: I thought she said --
C: CHARLIE
D: How do you do that? You can't eat fear.
C: JEAN
D: Sure you can. What happens to you, when you feel afraid? Doesn't your body produce all sorts of chemical reactions?
C: CHARLIE
D: Does it?
C: LITTLE CHARLES IVY
D: It does. Yes.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: Adrenaline, and, and --
C: JEAN
D: Your body goes through a whole chemical process when it experiences fear. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 77.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: -- yep, and cortisol --
C: JEAN
D: Don't you think an animal experiences fear?
C: STEVE
D: You bet it does. I used to work in a cattle processing plant, lot of fear flying around that place.
C: JEAN
D: So when you eat an animal, you're eating all that fear it felt when it was slaughtered to make food.
C: CHARLIE
D: Wow. You mean I've been eating fear, what, three times a day for sixty years?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: This one won't have a meal `less there's meat in it.
C: CHARLIE
D: I guess it's the way I was raised, but it just doesn't seem like a legitimate meal `less it has some meat somewhere --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: If I make a pasta dish of some kind, he'll be like, "Okay, that's good for an appetizer, now where's the meat?"
C: VIOLET
D: "Where's the meat?" Isn't that some TV commercial, the old lady says, "Where's the meat?"
C: KAREN
D: "Beef," "Where's the beef?"
C: VIOLET
D: "Where's the meat?!" "Where's the meat?!" "Where's the meat?!"
E: screeching
C: BARBARA
D: That's pleasant. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 78.
C: CHARLIE
D: I thought the services were lovely.
C: KAREN STEVE
D: Yes, weren't they --? Preacher did a fine job.
N: Vi sticks her hand out, flat, wiggles it back and forth.
C: VIOLET
D: Ehhhhh! I give it a... Ehhhhh!
E: repeats gesture
C: KAREN BARBARA
D: Really? I thought it was -- Great, now we get some dramatic criticism.
C: VIOLET
D: Too much talk about poetry, teaching. He hadn't written any poetry to speak of since `65 and he never liked teaching worth a damn. Nobody talked about the good stuff. Man was a world- class alcoholic, more'n fifty years. Nobody told the story about that night he got wrangled into giving a talk at that TU alumni dinner... Drank a whole bottle of Ron Bocoy White Rum -- don't know why I remember that -- and got up to give this talk, and he fouled himself! Comes back to our table with this huge --
E: CONT'D laughs
C: BARBARA
D: Yeah, I can't imagine why no one told that story.
C: STEVE
D: I don't know much about poetry, but I thought his poems were extraordinary. And your reading was very fine.
E: to Bill
C: BILL
D: Thank you.
C: VIOLET
D: Who are you? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 79.
E: to Steve

C: STEVE
D: Heidebrecht.
C: VIOLET
D: Hide-a-burrr...German, you're a German.
C: STEVE
D: Well, German-Irish, really, I --
C: VIOLET
D: That's peculiar, Karen, to bring a date to your father's funeral. I know the poetry was good, but I wouldn't have really considered it date material --
C: BARBARA
D: Jesus.
C: KAREN
D: He's not a date, he's my fiance. We're getting married on New Years. In Miami, I hope you can make it.
C: VIOLET
D: I don't really see that happening, do you? Steve. That right? Steve?
C: STEVE
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: VIOLET
D: You ever been married before?
C: KAREN
D: That's personal.
C: STEVE
D: I don't mind. Yes, ma'am, I have.
C: VIOLET
D: More'n once? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 80.
C: STEVE
D: Three times, actually, three times before this --
C: VIOLET
D: You should pretty much have it down by now, then.
C: STEVE
D: Right, right --
E: laughs
N: Everybody's eating, passing food. Vi turns to Mattie Fae.
C: VIOLET
D: I had that one pegged. I mean, look at him, you can tell he's been married.
C: KAREN
D: I took Steve out to show him the old fort and it's gone!
C: IVY KAREN
D: That's been gone for years. That made me so sad!
C: BILL
D: What is this now?
C: KAREN
D: Our old fort, where we used to play Cowboys and Indians.
C: IVY
D: Daddy said rats were getting in there.
C: VIOLET
D: Karen! Shame on you! Don't you know not to say Cowboys and Indians? You played Cowboys and Native Americans, right Barb?
C: BARBARA
D: What did you take? What pills?
C: VIOLET
D: Lemme alone --
N: Charlie's silverware clatters to the floor. He appears to be having some kind of attack.
C: CHARLIE
D: Uh-oh! "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 81.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: What is it?
C: CHARLIE
D: UH-OH!
C: MATTIE FAE
D: What's the matter?
C: LITTLE CHARLES IVY
D: Dad --? You okay, Uncle --
C: CHARLIE
D: I got a big bite of fear! I'm shakin' in my boots! Fear never tasted so good.
N: Laughter. Charlie digs into his plate ravenously.
C: STEVE
D: Right, right, it's pretty good once you get used to the taste.
C: BARBARA
D: I catch her eating a cheeseburger every now and again.
C: JEAN
D: I do not!
C: BARBARA
D: Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra fear.
C: JEAN
D: Mom, you are such a liar!
N: More laughter. Violet stares at Jean.
C: VIOLET
D: Y'know...if I ever called my mom a liar? She would've knocked my goddamn head off my shoulders.
N: Silence.

D: Mom... "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 82.
C: VIOLET
D: We took care of it some time back.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom, we don't want to talk about this.
C: VIOLET
D: I want to talk about it. What about what I want to talk about, that count for anything? Bev made some good investments, believe it or not, and we had money for you girls in his will, but we talked it over after some years passed and decided to change things, leave everything to me. We never got around to taking care of it legally, but you should know he meant to leave the money to me.
E: beat
C: BARBARA
D: Okay.
C: VIOLET
D: Okay? Okay?
E: looks to Ivy, Karen
C: IVY
D: Okay.
C: VIOLET
D: Karen? Okay?
N: Uncertain, Karen looks to Steve, then Barbara.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay.
C: KAREN
D: Okay.
C: VIOLET
D: Okay. But now some of this furniture, some of this old shit you can just have. I don't want it, got no use for it. Maybe I should have an auction.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Sure, an auction's a fine idea -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 83.
C: VIOLET
D: Some things, though, like the silver, that's worth a pretty penny. But if you like I'll sell it to you, cheaper'n I might get in an auction.
C: BARBARA
D: Or you might never get around to the auction and then we can just have it for free after you die.
C: IVY
D: Barbara...
N: Beat. Violet coolly studies Barbara.
C: VIOLET
D: You might at that.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: Excuse me, Bill? I'm wondering, the reading you did, those poems --?
C: VIOLET
D: Where are you living now, Bill? You want this old sideboard?
C: BILL
D: I beg your pardon.
C: VIOLET
D: You and Barbara are separated, right? Or you divorced already?
C: BILL
D: ...We're separated.
C: VIOLET
D: Thought you could slip that one by me, didn't you?
E: to Barbara
C: BARBARA
D: What is the matter with you?
C: VIOLET
D: Nobody slips anything by me. I know what's what. Your father thought he's slipping one by me, right? No way. I'm sorry you two're having trouble, maybe you can work it out. Bev'n I separated a few times, course we didn't call it that. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 84.
C: BARBARA
D: Help us to benefit from an illustration of your storybook marriage.
C: VIOLET
D: Truth is, you can't compete with a younger woman. One of those unfair things in life. Is there a younger woman involved?
C: BARBARA
D: You've said enough on this topic, I think.
C: BILL
D: Yes. There's a younger woman.
C: VIOLET
D: Y'see? Odds're against you there, babe.
C: IVY
D: Mom believes women don't grow more attractive with age.
C: KAREN
D: Oh, I disagree, I --
C: VIOLET
D: I didn't say they "don't grow more attractive," I said they get ugly. And it's not really a matter of opinion, Karen dear. You've only just started to prove it yourself.
C: CHARLIE
D: You're in rare form today, Vi.
C: VIOLET
D: The day calls for it, doesn't it? What form would you have me in?
C: CHARLIE
D: I just don't understand why you're so adversarial.
C: VIOLET
D: I'm just truth-telling. Some people get antagonized by the truth. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 85.
E: to Barbara
C: CHARLIE
D: Everyone here loves you, dear.
C: VIOLET
D: You think you can shame me, Charlie? Blow it out your ass.
C: BARBARA
D: Three days ago... I had to identify my father's corpse. Now I'm supposed to sit here and listen to you viciously attack each and every member of this family --
N: Violet rises, her voice booming.
C: VIOLET
D: Attack my family?! You ever been attacked in your sweet spoiled life?! Tell her `bout attacks, Mattie Fae, tell her what an attack looks like!
C: MATTIE FAE IVY
D: Vi, please -- Settle down, Mom --
C: VIOLET
D: Stop telling me to settle down, goddam it! I'm not a goddamn invalid! I don't need to be abided, do I?! Am I already passed over?!
E: CONT'D
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Honey --
C: VIOLET
D: This woman came to my rescue when one of my dear mother's many gentlemen friends was attacking me, with a claw hammer! You think you been attacked?! What do you know about life on these Plains? What do you know about hard times?
E: points to Mattie Fae
C: BARBARA
D: I know you had a rotten childhood, Mom. Who didn't?
C: VIOLET
D: You DON'T know! You do NOT know! None of you know, `cept this woman right here and that man we buried today! "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 86.
E: MORE
C: VIOLET
D: Sweet girl, sweet Barbara, my heart breaks for every time you ever felt pain. I wish I coulda shielded you from it. But if you think for a solitary second you can fathom the pain that man endured in his natural life, you got another think coming. * Do you know where your father lived from age four till about ten? Do you?
E: CONT'D
N: No one responds.
C: VIOLET
D: Do you?!
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: No.
C: IVY
D: No.
C: VIOLET
D: In a Pontiac Sedan. With his mother, his father, in a fucking car! Now what do you want to say about your rotten childhood? That's the crux of the biscuit: we lived too hard, then rose too high. We sacrificed everything and we did it all for you. Your father and I were the first in our families to finish high school and he wound up an award-winning poet. You girls, given a college education, taken for granted no doubt, and where'd you wind up? Whadda you do? Whadda you do? Who're you? Jesus, you worked as hard as us, you'd all be President. You never had real problems so you got to make all your problems yourselves.
E: jabs a finger at Karen jabs a finger at Ivy jabs a finger at Barbara

D: Just time we had some truth's told `round here. Damn fine day, tell the truth. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 87.

D: The truth is...I forgot to set the clock. The power didn't go out, I just...forgot to set the clock. Sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, everyone. Excuse me...I...I.
N: He stumbles from the room. A long moment, then -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 88.
C: VIOLET
D: Scintillating.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: I gave up a long time ago... Little Charles is your project.
E: to Charlie
C: IVY
D: Charles. His name is Charles.
E: near tears
C: VIOLET
D: Poor Ivy. Poor thing.
C: IVY
D: Please, Mom...
C: VIOLET
D: Poor baby.
C: IVY
D: Please...
C: VIOLET
D: She always had a feeling for the underdog.
C: IVY
D: Don't be mean to me right now, okay?
C: VIOLET
D: Everyone's got this idea I'm mean all of a sudden.
C: IVY
D: Please, momma.
C: VIOLET
D: I told you, I'm just telling the --
C: BARBARA
D: You're a drug addict.
C: VIOLET
D: That is the truth! That's what I'm getting at! I, everybody listen... I am a drug addict. I am addicted to drugs, pills, specially downers.
N: She pulls a bottle from her pocket, holds them up. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 89.
C: VIOLET
D: Y'see these little blue babies? These are my best fucking friends and they never let me down. Try to get `em away from me and I'll eat you alive.
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara lunges at the bottle, she and Vi wrestle for it.
C: BARBARA
D: Gimme those goddamn pills --
C: VIOLET
D: I'll eat you alive, girl!
N: Bill and Ivy try to restrain Barbara; Mattie Fae tries to restrain Violet. Others rise, ad-lib. Pandemonium.
C: STEVE IVY
D: Holy shit -- Barbara, stop it --!
C: CHARLIE KAREN
D: Hey, now, c'mon --! Oh God --
N: Violet wrests the pills from Barb. Bill pulls Barb back into her seat. Violet shakes the bottle, taunting Barb. Barb lunges again, grabs her mother by the hair, toppling chairs, they crash into the --
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Tumble to the floor. Pandemonium, screaming. The family rushes after them into the living room. Barb has her mother pinned on the floor and is strangling her. Bill and Charlie struggle to pull Barbara off, pry her fingers off Violet's throat and get her away. Johnna and Mattie Fae rush to Violet, get her to a chair.
C: VIOLET
D: Goddamn you... goddamn you, Barb...
C: BARBARA
D: Shut up! Okay. Pill raid. Johnna, help Ivy in the kitchen; Bill and Jean upstairs with me. You remember how to do this, right?
E: silence to Ivy
C: IVY
D: Yeah... "August" 10/23/12 BLUE Draft 90.
C: BARBARA
D: Go through everything. Every closet, every drawer, every shoebox.
C: CHARLIE
D: What should we do?
C: BARBARA
D: Get Mom some black coffee, a wet towel and listen to her bullshit. Karen, call Dr. Burke.
C: VIOLET
D: You can't do this! This is my house! This is my house!
C: BARBARA
D: You don't get it, do you?
N: She strides to her mother, looms over her.
C: BARBARA
D: I'M RUNNING THINGS NOW!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The hallway is empty, but we hear the sounds of the search coming from the bedroom. Barbara appears, looks through the linen closet, looking behind stacked towels and old electric blankets. Finds a bottle of pills in the back. Ivy comes upstairs, followed closely by Karen. Hold out pill * bottles, Barb adds them to the ones she's already collected in a large Ziplock bag.
C: IVY
D: That's all we could find. *
N: Barb heads for the bathroom, lifts the toilet seat. Begins * dumping pills into the bowl. Karen examines the bottles. * KAREN * Why'd Dr. Burke write her so many * prescriptions? Doesn't he know --? * IVY * It's not just him. She's got a doctor * in every port. * "August" 11/09/12 Pink Draft 91.
C: BARBARA
D: You knew this was going on again?
N: Ivy shrugs. Finished emptying the pills, Barb flushes the * toilet, steps to her mother's open bedroom door, looks in.
S: INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Violet lays motionless on the bed in the semi-darkness, facing the wall, still fully clothed. Ivy and Karen join her. They stare at their mother's comatose form. Finally: *
C: KAREN
D: Now what?
N: BARBARA * Wine... lots of wine. * A68 OMIT A68 * 68 OMIT 68 * 69 OMIT 69 *

N: Barbara, Ivy, Karen and the remains of the dinner wine sit * around the table in the backyard gazebo. * BARBARA * Think we can goad Mom into giving * Burke her "greatest" generation * speech tomorrow, tell him about the * claw hammer? * "August" 11/11/12 Yellow Pages 92. A70 CONTINUED: A70
C: IVY
D: Won't do any good, he's part of the same generation.
C: BARBARA
D: "Greatest Generation," my ass. What * makes them so great? Because they * were poor and hated Nazis? Who doesn't fucking hate Nazis? Remember * when we checked her in the psych ward, that stunt she pulled?
N: IVY * Big speech, she's getting clean, making this incredible sacrifice for her family, she's let us down but now * she'll prove she's a good mother.
C: KAREN
D: I wasn't there.
C: BARBARA
D: She smuggled Darvocet into the psych ward ...in her vagina. There's your Greatest Generation for you. She made this speech to us while she was clenching a bottle of pills in her cooch, for God's sake.
C: KAREN
D: God, I've never heard this story. "August" 11/11/12 Yellow Pages 93. A70 CONTINUED: A70
C: IVY
D: Did you just say "cooch"?
C: BARBARA
D: The phrase "Mom's pussy" seems gauche.
C: IVY
D: You're a little more comfortable with "cooch," are you?
C: BARBARA
D: What word should I use to describe our mother's vagina?
C: IVY
D: I don't know, but --
C: BARBARA
D: "Mom's beaver"? "Mother's box"?
C: IVY KAREN
D: Oh God -- Barbara!
N: As their laughter slowly dies down -- *
C: KAREN
D: One thing about Mom and Dad. You have to tip your cap to anyone who can stay married that long.
C: IVY
D: Karen. He killed himself.
C: BARBARA
D: Is there something going on between you and Little Charles?
C: IVY
D: I don't know that I'm comfortable talking about that. "August" 11/09/12 Pink Draft 93A. A70 CONTINUED: A70
C: BARBARA
D: Because you know he's our first cousin.
C: IVY
D: Give me a break.
C: KAREN
D: You know you shouldn't consider children.
C: IVY
D: I can't anyway, I had a hysterectomy last year.
N: What? Barbara and Karen stare at Ivy. "August" 10/23/12 BLUE Draft 94. A70 CONTINUED: A70 KAREN * Why?
C: IVY
D: Cervical cancer.
C: KAREN
D: I didn't know.
C: BARBARA
D: Neither did I.
C: IVY
D: I didn't tell anyone except Charles. That's where it started between us.
C: BARBARA
D: Why not?
C: IVY
D: And hear it from Mom the rest of my life? She doesn't need another excuse to treat me like some damaged thing.
C: BARBARA
D: You might have told us.
C: IVY
D: You didn't tell us about you and Bill.
C: BARBARA
D: That's different.
C: IVY
D: Why? Because it's you, and not me?
C: BARBARA
D: Because divorce is an embarrassing public admission of defeat. Cancer's fucking cancer, you can't help that. We're your sisters.
N: IVY * I don't feel that connection very * keenly. * KAREN * I feel very connected, to both of you. * IVY * We never see you, you're never around, * you haven't been around -- * "August" 10/23/12 BLUE Draft 95. A70 CONTINUED: A70 KAREN * I still feel that connection! *
C: IVY
D: I can't perpetuate these myths of family or sisterhood anymore. We're just people, some of us accidentally connected by genetics, a random selection of cells. *
C: BARBARA
D: When did you get so cynical?
C: IVY
D: That's funny, coming from you.
C: BARBARA
D: Bitter, sure, but "random selection of cells?"
C: IVY
D: Maybe my cynicism came with the realization that the responsibility of * caring for our parents was mine alone.
C: BARBARA
D: Don't give me that. I participated --
C: IVY
D: Till you had enough and got out, you and Karen both. I'm not criticizing. Do what you want. You did, Karen did.
C: BARBARA
D: And if you didn't, that's not my fault.
C: IVY
D: That's right, so don't lay this sister thing on me, all right? When I leave * here I won't feel any more guilty than * you two did. *
N: KAREN * I can't believe your world view is * this dark. * IVY * You live in Florida. * "August" 11/09/12 Pink Draft 96-97. A70 CONTINUED: A70
C: BARBARA
D: You're thinking of leaving?
C: IVY
D: Charles and I are going to New York.
N: Barb bursts out in derisive laughter. Karen joins her.
C: BARBARA
D: What are you going to do in New York?
C: IVY
D: We have plans.
C: BARBARA
D: Like what?
C: IVY
D: None of your business.
C: BARBARA
D: What about Mom?
C: IVY
D: What about her?
C: BARBARA
D: You feel comfortable leaving Mom here?
C: IVY
D: Do you? You think she was tough when he was alive? Think what it's going to be like now. * You're going back to Miami, right?
E: then to Karen
C: KAREN
D: Yes.
N: Ivy stands, gathers up her wine glass. "August" 10/23/12 BLUE Draft 98. A70 CONTINUED: A70 IVY * There you go, Barb. You want to know * what we're doing about Mom? Karen and * I are leaving.

S: 72 EXT. WESTON HOUSE YARD - NIGHT 72 *
N: The Weston women head for the house. * VIOLET * My girls all together. Hearing you * just now gave me a warm feeling. * Violet, sits on the swing in the semi-darkness, smoking, her * hair wrapped in a towel. They hadn't seen her. How long has * she been there? * "August" 10/23/12 BLUE Draft 99. BARBARA * You had a bath? * VIOLET * Uh-huh... *
C: BARBARA
D: You need something to eat? More * coffee?
C: VIOLET
D: No, honey, I'm fine. This house must have heard a lot of Weston girl secrets.
E: then
N: Karen moves to her mother, sits next to her on the swing. Barb leans against a fence post, Ivy hangs back. *
C: KAREN
D: I get embarrassed just thinking about it.
N: Karen takes a tube of hand creme from her purse.
C: VIOLET
D: Oh... nothing to be embarrassed about. Secret crushes, secret schemes. Province of teenage girls. I can't imagine anything more delicate, or bittersweet. Some part of you girls I always identified with... no matter how old you get, a woman's hard-pressed to throw off that part of herself. That smells good.
E: to Karen, re: hand creme
C: KAREN
D: It's apple. You want some?
C: VIOLET
D: Yes, please.
N: Violet puts out her cigarette. Karen passes her the creme.
C: VIOLET
D: I ever tell you the story of Raymond Qualls? Not much story to it. Boy I had a crush on when I was thirteen or so. Rough-looking boy, beat-up Levis, messy hair. Terrible underbite. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 100.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: VIOLET
D: But he had these beautiful cowboy boots, shiny chocolate leather. He was so proud of those boots, you could tell, way he'd strut around, all arms and elbows, puffed up and cocksure. I decided I needed to get a girly pair of those same boots and I convinced myself he'd ask me to go steady. He'd see me in those boots and say "Now there's the gal for me."
E: CONT'D
N: Violet lights another cigarette. *
C: VIOLET
D: Found the boots in a window downtown and just went crazy: praying for those boots, rehearsing the conversation I'd have with Raymond when he saw me in my boots. Must've asked my momma a hundred times if I could get those boots. "What do you want for Christmas, Vi?" "Momma, I'll give all of it up just for those boots." Bargaining, you know? She started dropping hints about a package under the tree she had wrapped up, about the size of a boot box, nice wrapping paper. "Now, Vi, don't you cheat and look in there before Christmas morning." Little smile on her face. Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy, under the tree, tearing open that box. There was a pair of boots, all right... men's work boots, holes in the toes, chewed up laces, caked in mud and dog shit. Lord, my momma laughed for days.
E: CONT'D
N: Silence.
C: BARBARA
D: Please don't tell me that's the end of the story.
C: VIOLET
D: Oh, no. That's the end.
N: Ivy shakes her head, goes inside. She's had enough of Violet to last a lifetime.
C: KAREN
D: You never got the boots? "August" 11/09/12 Pink Draft 101.
C: VIOLET
D: No, huh-uh.
C: BARBARA
D: Okay, well, that's the worst story I ever heard. That makes me wish for a heartwarming claw hammer story.
C: VIOLET
D: My momma was a nasty-mean old lady. I suppose that's where I get it from.
N: An awkward moment.
C: KAREN
D: You're not nasty-mean. You're our mother and we love you.
C: VIOLET
D: Thank you, sweetheart.
N: Karen leans her head against her mother's shoulder, takes her mother's hand. Off Barbara, watching this --
S: INT. GUEST ROOM - EARLY MORNING
N: Barbara wakes, takes a moment to get her bearings. Early sunlight pours in. Bill's still asleep. She sits up, studies him. Surprised to find him beside her. 74 OMIT 74 * 75 OMIT 75 * "August" 11/09/12 Pink Draft 102.
S: 76 INT/EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING 76 *
N: Barbara stands in the door. Closes her eyes, letting the * early morning sun warm her. After a long moment, Johnna appears with a coffee mug. Barb takes it, nods her thanks.
C: BARBARA
D: Last time I spoke with my father, we talked about the state of the world, and he said, "You know, this country was always pretty much a whorehouse, but at least it used to have some promise. Now it's just a shithole." I think maybe he was talking about something else, something more specific, personal... this house? This family? His marriage? Himself? There was something sad in his voice-- not sad, he always sounded sad -- hopeless. As if it had already happened. As if whatever was disappearing had already disappeared. And no one saw it go. This country, this experiment, America, this hubris: what a lament, if no one saw it go.
C: JOHNNA
D: Mrs. Fordham, are you going to fire me?
C: BARBARA
D: What? No. But I'll understand if you want to quit. I mean, there's work. And then there's work.
C: JOHNNA
D: I'm familiar with this job. I can do this job. I don't do it for you or Mrs. Weston. Or even for Mr. Weston. Right? I do it for me.
C: BARBARA
D: Why?
C: JOHNNA
D: I need the work.
C: BARBARA
D: Johnna, did my father say anything to you? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 103.
C: JOHNNA
D: He just seemed like maybe he had... he * talked about... He talked a lot about his daughters, his three daughters, and his granddaughter. That was his joy.
E: beat
C: BARBARA
D: Thank you. That makes me feel better. Knowing that you can lie.
N: Johnna smiles.
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE/WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: Barbara sits opposite DR. BURKE, a genial, charming and remotely creepy small town doctor. Ivy stands. Violet is visible out in the waiting room, Karen sitting with her.
C: DR. BURKE
D: The chemotherapy and the radiation, coupled with the overuse of pain medications --
C: BARBARA
D: -- right --
C: DR. BURKE
D: -- and without the benefit of more thorough testing, an MRI or CT scan, I believe your mother is showing signs of Mild Cognitive Impairment.
C: BARBARA
D: Mild Cognitive Impairment?
C: DR. BURKE
D: Brain damage. It may be time to consider placing her in a long term care facility. I'd certainly feel more comfortable knowing she was receiving that level of supervision.
C: BARBARA
D: That would make you comfortable? You would be comfortable with that?
C: DR. BURKE
D: Of course, it's a family decision. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 104.
C: BARBARA
D: You want us to send her to where, a psychiatric hospital?
C: DR. BURKE
D: Well, Beverly's gone.
C: BARBARA
D: Right. Not "gone" so much as "dead," but I see your point.
N: Ivy suppresses a laugh. Burke looks at Ivy, confused.
C: DR. BURKE
D: Legal guardianship for you and your sisters, with my recommendation, should be a simple --
C: IVY
D: Leave me out of this, thanks.
C: BARBARA
D: So you're thinking that if the three of us cooperated with you on a commitment end-around, we'd be less likely to sue your ass?
C: DR. BURKE
D: I'm sorry?
C: BARBARA
D: "Mild Cognitive Impairment?" Are you fucking kidding me? You really want to go before a judge and make a case for a couple radiation treatments and some chemo causing brain damage? Think you can make that stand up in court? When I'm sitting at the other table, doing this?
N: Barbara pulls out the Ziplock bag, throws a pill bottle at Dr. Burke, bouncing it lightly off his head.
C: DR. BURKE
D: All right, I think --
N: Throws another pill bottle at him.
C: BARBARA
D: Know whose name is on these bottles?
N: She hits him with another pill bottle. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 105.
C: DR. BURKE
D: Your mother is a very --
N: She hits him with another pill bottle.
C: IVY
D: Barb...
N: She hits him with another pill bottle. He relents, waits for her to get it out of her system. Only one problem with that idea, though -- She hits him with another pill bottle. Another pill bottle. And another pill bottle. She pauses. It seems she's done. But then, another pill bottle. And another.
C: BARBARA
D: We'll hang on to the bucket of these we have at home. For evidence. For your trial.
N: She gets up to go, gets to the door, turns and fires one last pill bottle at him. Leaves. Ivy lingers, grins at Burke.
S: INT/EXT. TALLGRASS PRAIRIE PRESERVE/BEV'S LINCOLN - DAY
N: The sun parched Indian grass and Turkey Toot are wilting but stirred by prairie winds. Bev's old Lincoln follows a thread of blacktop through the tall grass. Barb drives, Ivy up front. Karen's in the back with Violet.
C: VIOLET
D: Pull the car over.
C: BARBARA
D: We'll be home in a few minutes.
C: VIOLET
D: Pull the car over. I'm going to be sick.
E: beat
N: Barbara looks back, sees her mother means this literally, pulls to the side of the road. Violet gets out quickly. We stay with Barbara as she climbs out of the car, stares across the road, waiting for Violet, who can be heard retching. Karen and Ivy still in the car. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 106. The sound fades as Barbara contemplates the prairie and for a long moment... loses herself, back to this land, to her home. Her expression is unreadable, enigmatic. Then behind her, out of focus, we become aware of Violet running away, across the prairie, through the tall grass. Barbara turns, simply to get back in the car, sees Violet running through the field.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom?
N: Violet keeps running.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom?! Where are you going?
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara watches for another moment.
C: BARBARA
D: Goddamn it. Mom!
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara takes off after her. Ivy and Karen climb out, but don't follow. Shield their eyes to watch the chase. It's an odd sight, the two women, racing through the grass. One almost seventy, the other nearing fifty. Barbara is slow in her pursuit at first, maybe because of her shoes, or maybe because she just feels silly. Then realizes that Violet is not stopping... not unless Barbara stops her. Violet runs through the tall grass, puts a foot wrong, goes down. Barbara catches up, out of breath, collapses. They lay on the ground, wheezing, sweating.
C: BARBARA
D: Where the fuck are you going, Mom?
E: CONT'D
N: And now we see the full beauty of the land, the distant horizon, the high cumulous clouds, the endless blue sky. Barb and Violet two dots, lost in the unforgiving prairie.
C: BARBARA
D: There's nowhere to go.
E: CONT'D
S: INT/EXT. LINCOLN/WESTON HOUSE DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON
N: Barb pulls the Lincoln in beside Charlie's Caddie and Ivy's Honda. Shuts off the engine. Ivy and Karen climb out, start back for the house. Barbara turns to Violet. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 107.
C: BARBARA
D: I'm sorry.
C: VIOLET
D: Please, honey --
C: BARBARA
D: No, it's important I say this. I lost my temper at dinner and went too far. *
C: VIOLET
D: Barbara. The day, the funeral... the pills. I was spoiling for a fight and you gave it to me.
C: BARBARA
D: So... truce?
C: VIOLET
D: Truce.
E: laughs
N: They take a long moment, then -- *
C: BARBARA
D: What now?
C: VIOLET
D: How do you mean?
C: BARBARA
D: Don't you think you should at least consider a rehab center?
N: Karen turns, realizing they're not following. Should she go back to the car? She decides no, continues inside.
C: VIOLET
D: I can't go through that again. No, I can do this. You got rid of my pills, right?
C: BARBARA
D: All we could find.
C: VIOLET
D: I don't have that many hiding places.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom, now, come on.
C: VIOLET
D: You wanna search me? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 108.
C: BARBARA
D: Uh... no.
C: VIOLET
D: If the pills are gone, I'll be fine. Just need a few days to get my feet under me.
C: BARBARA
D: I can't imagine what all this must be like for you right now. I just want you to know, you're not alone. If you need any help --
C: VIOLET
D: I don't need help.
C: BARBARA
D: I want to help.
C: VIOLET
D: I don't need your help.
C: BARBARA
D: Mom.
C: VIOLET
D: I don't need your help. I've gotten myself through some... I know how this goes: once all the talking's through, people go back to their own nonsense. I know that. So, don't worry about me. I'll manage. I get by.
N: Violet gets out, heads inside. Barbara watches her go.
S: INT. WESTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Ivy finds Little Charles watching television.
C: IVY
D: Is the coast clear?
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: Never very.
N: Ivy waits until Karen passes through, heads upstairs.
C: IVY
D: What are you watching? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 109.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: Television.
C: IVY
D: Can I watch it with you?
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I wish you would.
N: She sits beside him on the couch.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I almost blew it last night. Are you mad at me?
E: CONT'D she nods
C: IVY
D: Nope.
N: They hold hands.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I was trying to be brave.
C: IVY
D: I know.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I just... I want everyone to know that I got what I always wanted. And that means... I'm not a loser.
C: IVY
D: Hey. Hey.
N: He turns to look at her.
C: IVY
D: You're my hero.
E: CONT'D
N: He considers this... then breaks into a huge smile, mutes the TV, goes to the ancient, oak, electric piano, turns it on.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: Come on, help me push the pedal.
N: She joins him on the piano bench.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I wrote this for you.
E: CONT'D
N: He plays, and quietly sings a gentle but quirky love song. It's charming, touching. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 110. She smiles, he smiles back. Midway through, Mattie Fae enters, watches for a moment. Then breaks the spell.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Liberace. Get yourself together, we have to get home and take care of those damn dogs. They've probably eaten the drapes by now.
N: Charlie comes down the stairs with their overnight bag.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm sure the house is fine.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Oh, look, honey, Little Charles has got the TV on.
E: notices the TV
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: No, I was just --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: This one watches so much television, it's rotted his brain.
C: IVY
D: I'm sure that's not true.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: What was it I caught you watching the other day?
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I don't remember.
C: CHARLIE
D: Mattie Fae --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: You do so remember, some dumb talk * show about people swapping wives.
C: LITTLE CHARLES
D: I don't remember.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: You don't remember. Too bad there isn't a job where they pay you to sit around watching TV. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 111.
E: to Ivy
C: CHARLIE
D: C'mon, Mattie Fae --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Y'know he got fired from a shoe store?
E: still to Ivy
C: CHARLIE
D: Mattie Fae, we're gonna get in the car and go home and if you say one more mean thing to that boy I'm going to kick your fat Irish ass onto the highway. You hear me?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: What the hell did you say--?
C: CHARLIE
D: You kids go outside, would you please?
N: Ivy and Little Charles go.
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't understand this meanness. I look at you and your sister and the way you talk to people and I don't understand it. I can't understand why folks can't be respectful of one another. I don't think there's any excuse for it. My family didn't treat each other that way.
E: CONT'D
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Maybe that's because your family --
C: CHARLIE
D: You had better not say anything about my family right now. I mean it. We buried a man yesterday I loved very much. And whatever faults he may have had, he was a good, kind, decent person. And to hear you tear into your own son not even a day later dishonors Beverly's memory. We've been married thirty-eight years. I wouldn't trade them for anything. But if you can't find a generous place in your heart for your own son, we're not going to make it to thirty-nine.
N: He goes. She takes a moment to collect herself, turns to follow, finds Barbara standing out in the open kitchen door. * There's an awkward moment. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 112.
C: BARBARA
D: I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I froze.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: That's -- you have a cigarette, hon?
C: BARBARA
D: No, I quit years ago.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: So did I. Just sounded good to me. I thought at dinner... at that horrible dinner last night, seemed like, something might be going on between Ivy and Little Charles. Do you know if that's true?
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, this is...I'm not sure what to...
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Look, just. Is it true?
C: BARBARA
D: Yes. It's true.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Okay. That can't happen.
C: BARBARA
D: This is going to be difficult, uh... Ivy and Little Charles have always marched to their own... and I'd expect this to be toughest on you --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Barb...?
C: BARBARA
D: They're in love. Or they think they are. What's the difference, right?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Honey --
C: BARBARA
D: I know it's unorthodox for cousins to get together, at least these days --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: They're not cousins. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 113.
C: BARBARA
D: -- but believe it or not, it's not as uncommon as you might --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Listen to me. They're not cousins.
C: BARBARA
D: Beg pardon?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Little Charles is not your cousin. He's your brother. He's your blood brother. He is not your cousin. He is your blood brother. Half-brother. He's your father's child. Which means that he is Ivy's brother. Do you see? Little Charles and Ivy are brother and sister.

C: BARBARA
D: Uncle Charlie doesn't suspect?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: We've never discussed it.
C: BARBARA
D: What?!
C: MATTIE FAE
D: We've never discussed it. Okay? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 114.
C: BARBARA
D: Did Dad know?
C: MATTIE FAE
D: Yes. Y'know, I'm not proud of this.
C: BARBARA
D: Really. You people amaze me. What, were you drunk? Was this just some --
C: MATTIE FAE
D: I wasn't drunk, no. Maybe it's hard for you to believe, looking at me, knowing me the way you do, all these years. I know to you, I'm just your old fat Aunt Mattie Fae. I'm more than that, sweetheart, there's more to me than that. I don't know why Little Charles is such a disappointment to me. Maybe he, well, I don't know why. I'm disappointed for him, more than anything. I made a mistake, a long time ago. Okay? I paid for it. But the mistake ends here.
C: BARBARA
D: If Ivy found out, it would destroy her.
C: MATTIE FAE
D: I'm sure as hell not gonna tell her. You have to find a way to stop it. You have to put a stop to it.

D: Number one by far. Want a shotgun? You don't know what a shotgun is?
E: off her look
C: JEAN
D: I know what a shotgun is.
C: STEVE
D: Not that kind of shotgun, here. Just put your lips right next to mine and you inhale while I exhale.
C: JEAN
D: Okay.
N: He puts the joint in his mouth, lit end first. Their lips nearly touch as he blows marijuana smoke into her mouth in a steady stream. She nearly chokes.
C: STEVE
D: Hold it. Don't let it out.
N: She finally gasps, exhales, coughs.

D: Out at the car. We're leaving. Back to Florida, tonight, now. Me and Steve, together. Want to give me some grief about that?
C: BARBARA
D: Now wait just a goddamn --
C: KAREN
D: You better find out from Jean exactly what went on before you start pointing fingers. Cause I doubt Jean's blameless in all this. And I'm not blaming her, just cause I said she's not blameless doesn't mean I've blamed her. I'm saying she might share in the responsibility. It's not cut and dried, black and white, good and bad. It lives where everything lives: somewhere in the middle. Where the rest of us live, everyone but you.
C: BARBARA
D: Karen--
C: KAREN
D: He's not perfect. Just like the rest of us, down here in the muck. I'm no angel myself. I've done some things I'm not proud of. Things you'll never know about. I may even have to do some things I'm not proud of again. Cause sometimes life puts you in a corner that way. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 121.

S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
N: Karen bursts through the screen door, rushes down the steps to Steve's waiting Ferrari, it's lights already on, engine running. Throws her suitcase in the back. Barb steps out onto the porch as it reverses, SLAMS into gear and accelerates down the drive, spewing gravel as it goes. Bill comes out, watches it disappear with Barbara. Then:
C: BILL
D: I'm taking Jean with me, heading back to Colorado in the morning.
N: But Barb's still focused on the distant Ferrari.
C: BILL
D: She's too much for you right now.
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: Okay.
C: BILL
D: I'm sure you'll find a way to blame me for all this.

C: BILL
D: Right. Even if things don't work out.
C: BARBARA
D: And I'm never really going to understand why, am I?
N: Bill struggles... seems he might have more to say, but then:
C: BILL
D: Probably not.
N: Bill goes. She watches him leave. Fights back tears.
S: EXT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY
N: A blistering hot late August day. The Weston house sits in bucolic, heat-weary silence. The driveway no longer crowded with cars. Barb stands nearly where she did the night before, in her sweats and robe. Watching yet another car go. Their rental, Bill behind the wheel, backing up. Jean in the seat beside him. Jean stares blankly at her mother, as she rolls past. Bill never looks back. The rental heads down the drive, passing Ivy's Honda arriving. Bill slows for a moment to let Ivy pass. Then continues on it's way back to Tulsa and the airport. Ivy pulls in next to Bev's big Lincoln. Climbs out. Walks to her sister, looks back to the rental leaving.

C: BARBARA
D: Back off.
C: IVY
D: I'm nervous.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.
C: IVY
D: I have to tell her, don't I? We're leaving for New York tomorrow.
C: BARBARA
D: That's not a good idea. For you and Charles to take this any further.
C: IVY
D: Where is this coming from?

C: IVY
D: I love the man I'm related to--

S: INT. WESTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Finds Violet still at the table, lighting a cigarette. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 132.
C: VIOLET
D: We couldn't let Ivy run off with Little Charles. Just wouldn't be right.
N: Barbara doesn't respond, keeps her distance.
C: VIOLET
D: She'll be back. She's a sweet girl, Ivy, and I love her to death. But she isn't strong. Not like you. Or me.
E: CONT'D
C: BARBARA
D: You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae?
C: VIOLET
D: Oh sure. I never told them I knew. But your father knew. He knew I knew. But we never talked about it. I chose the higher ground. If I'd had the chance, there at the end, I would've told him, "I hope this isn't about Little Charles, cause you know I know all about that." If I'd reached him at that motel, I would've said, "You'd be better off if you quit sulking about this ancient history."
E: and then
C: BARBARA
D: ...what motel?
C: VIOLET
D: I called over there on Monday after I got into that safety deposit box. But it was too late, he'd checked out.
C: BARBARA
D: How did you know where he was?
N: Violet is growing agitated with the interrogation.
C: VIOLET
D: The note. He said I could call him over at the Country Squire Motel --
C: BARBARA
D: He left a note?
C: VIOLET
D: And I did, I called him on Monday. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 133.

D: After you got the money out of your * safety deposit box...
C: VIOLET
D: We had an arrangement. You have to * understand, for people like your * father and me, who never had any * money, ever, as kids, people from our * generation, that money is important. *
N: BARBARA * If you could've stopped Daddy from * killing himself, you wouldn't have * needed to get into your safety deposit * box. * VIOLET * Well, hindsight's always twenty- * twenty, isn't it? * Barbara stares at her mother for a long moment. Then --

N: Barbara looks off, quietly:
C: BARBARA
D: You were both fucked-up... You were * fucked-up... You are fucked-up. *
C: VIOLET
D: You'd better understand this, you smug little ingrate. There's only one reason Beverly killed himself and that's you. Think there's any way he would've done what he did if you were still here? No, just him and me, here in this house, in the dark, left to ourselves, abandoned, wasted lifetimes devoted to your care and comfort. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 134.

D: So stick that knife of judgment in me, go ahead, but make no mistake, his blood is just as much on your hands as it is on mine.
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara is reeling, trying to comprehend.
C: VIOLET
D: He did this though, not us. Can you imagine anything more cruel, to make me responsible? Just to weaken me, make me prove my character? So I waited, to get my hands on that safety deposit box. But I would have waited anyway. You want to show who's stronger, Bev? Nobody's stronger than me, goddamn it. When nothing is left, when everything is gone and disappeared, I'll be here.
E: CONT'D
N: Violet YELLS up to the empty house.
C: VIOLET
D: Who's stronger now, you son-of-a- bitch?!
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara feels sick, the floor giving away beneath her. She takes a moment. Then:
C: BARBARA
D: You're right, Mom. You're the strong one.
N: She goes to her mother, kisses her. Turns, heads into the hall, grabs her purse and Bev's keys from the dish. Violet only slowly realizes Barbara's gone.
C: VIOLET
D: ...Barbara?

C: VIOLET
D: ...Barbara?
E: CONT'D

E: OS
N: We stay on Barb as she slowly pulls herself back together. Brushes tears from her cheeks. Laughs darkly. Notices her hands are shaking from the adrenaline. Slows, pulls the pick-up to the side of the road at the top of a small rise. Climbs out, stares out over the miles of prairie. The wind gently ruffles her clothing, her hair.
