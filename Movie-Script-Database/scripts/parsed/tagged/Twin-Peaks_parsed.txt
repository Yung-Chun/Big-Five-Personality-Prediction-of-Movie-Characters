S: 6. EXT. SMALL AIRPORT OUTSIDE OF PORTLAND - DAY

S: 7. INT. SECURITY LOUNGE OF THE AIRPORT - SAME
N: Desmond enters. Cole and another man, SAM STANLEY, walk towards him.
C: COLE
D: CHET, GIVE SAM STANLEY THE GLAD HAND. HE'S COME OVER FROM SPOKANE.
E: motioning to the man standing there
N: Desmond and Stanley shake.
C: STANLEY
D: It's a pleasure. I've heard a lot about you.
C: COLE
D: SAM'S THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE WHITEMAN CASE.
C: DESMOND
D: Congratulations. I heard about that.
C: COLE
D: YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
E: plowing ahead
N: LIL walks to them from another room. She goes into a contorted dance. 8. LIL'S DANCE Things we notice. -- She makes a sour face. -- She walks in place. -- She puts one hand in her pocket and makes a fist with the other. -- While she is doing this, she blinks with both eyes. -- She is wearing a red wig. At one point during this Cole adds a sentence.
C: COLE
D: SHE'S MY MOTHER'S SISTER'S GIRL.
N: Cole holds four fingers in front of his eyes.
C: DESMOND
D: Federal?
E: noticing the fingers
N: Cole gives him the thumbs up. Lil finishes her dance.
C: COLE GOOD LUCK, CHET.

C: DESMOND
D: Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
S: 9. EXT. HIGHWAY ON THE WAY TO DEER MEADOW - DAY
N: Desmond's car on the highway.
S: 10. INT. DESMOND'S CAR - SAME
N: As they barrel down the highway -
C: STANLEY
D: That was really something. That dancing girl. What did it mean?
E: after a beat
C: DESMOND
D: Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
C: STANLEY
D: Code, I've heard a lot about this.
N: Desmond pulls his arm back so that only his fingers come out of his sleeve.
C: DESMOND
D: Sort of shorthand.
C: STANLEY
D: Shorthand. really?
E: missing the humor
C: DESMOND
D: We're heading into a difficult situation.
C: STANLEY
D: How do you figure?
C: DESMOND
D: I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
N: As Desmond explains we -
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: 11. FLASHBACK: LIL'S DANCE In slow motion. ON LIL'S SOUR FACE
C: DESMOND
D: Lil was wearing a sour face.
C: STANLEY
D: What do you mean?
C: DESMOND
D: Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
N: ON LIL BLINKING BOTH EYES
C: DESMOND
D: Both eyes blinking means there is going to be trouble higher up... the eyes of the local authority. A sheriff and a deputy. That would be my guess. Two of the local law enforcers are going to be a problem.
N: ON LIL PUTTING ONE HAND IN HER POCKET AND ONE IN A FIST DESMOND (continued) If you noticed she had one hand in her pocket which means they are hiding something, and the other hand made a fist which means they are going to be belligerent. ON LIL WALKING IN PLACE DESMOND (continued) Lil was walking in place which means there's going to be a lot of legwork involved. WE SEE COLE PUTTING HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AND SAYING LIL IS HIS SISTER'S GIRL. DESMOND (continued) Cole said Lil was "his mother's sister's girl". What is missing in that sentence? The Uncle.
C: STANLEY
D: Oh, the uncle is missing.
C: DESMOND
D: Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
C: STANLEY
D: So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
N: ON LIL'S RED WIG
C: DESMOND
D: Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
C: STANLEY
D: The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
C: DESMOND
D: Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
C: STANLEY
D: A blue rose.
C: DESMOND
D: Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
N: Stanley rides along quietly for a while.
C: STANLEY
D: What did Gordon's tie mean?
C: DESMOND
D: What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
C: STANLEY
D: Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
C: DESMOND
D: He talks loud. And he loves his code.
C: STANLEY
D: I see. He does talk loud.
C: DESMOND
D: Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
C: STANLEY
D: It must be a high priority situation.
S: 12. EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME
N: Desmond's car drives off.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 13. EXT. DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON
N: Desmond and Stanley arrive. The Sheriff's Station is in a sorry state outside... They walk up to the old steps and enter.
S: 14. INT. DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
N: Agent Desmond and Stanley walk into a very small reception area. At the counter Desmond shows his badge to CLIFF HOWARD, the Deputy.
C: DESMOND
D: Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to see Sheriff Cable.
N: Cliff just smiles for a long minute.
C: CLIFF
D: Why don't you folks have a seat. Make yourself at home. It's gonna be a while.
N: Desmond stays standing and Stanley sits. After another long moment, Cliff joins the SECRETARY in a conspiratorial giggle over the long wait they are planning to give the FBI. In the middle of a giggle Cliff smiles up at Desmond. CLIFF (continued) Why don't you have some of that coffee. It was fresh two days ago. Cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary pretending to look at some paper work. They both laugh.
C: DESMOND
D: Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
C: CLIFF
D: Oh.
E: still smiling
N: Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff Cable's office. Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to do something. While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way. Cliff tries to knock Chet's hand away. Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount of pain. CLIFF (continued) AAAHHHHHHHH... Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a chair. While the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary.
C: DESMOND
D: You can start that FRESH pot of coffee right now.
N: Desmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office. Stanley remains behind continuing to observe every detail.
S: 15. INT. SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: SHERIFF CABLE looks up from his work.
C: CABLE
D: How the hell did you...
N: Desmond shows his credentials.
C: DESMOND
D: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond.
N: Cliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns to him. DESMOND (continued) That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable can take it from here Cable signals Cliff to leave. DESMOND (continued) I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
C: CABLE
D: Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
C: DESMOND
D: Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
C: CABLE
D: You're lucky I am not wasting you.
C: DESMOND
D: Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
N: Cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects. He throws it to Desmond.
C: CABLE
D: A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
C: DESMOND
D: That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
C: CABLE
D: Out back in our morgue
N: Desmond starts to leave. CABLE (continued) It's 4:30. We close at five.
C: DESMOND
D: We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
N: As Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper clipping with picture. The caption reads: "CABLE BENDS STEEL" The newspaper shows a picture of Cable in a He-Man pose bending a steel BAR into a U shape. He turns to leave and Stanley seems to have appeared right on time. Desmond moves down the hall and Stanley follows.
S: 16. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
N: As Desmond and Stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of steel BARS similar to the one they saw Cable bending in the picture. AT THE MORGUE DOOR Stanley moves up to Desmond and speaks confidentially.
C: STANLEY
D: You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this whole office, furniture included, is worth 27,000 dollars.
N: Desmond doesn't know what to say to him. They enter the morgue.
S: 17. INT. TINY MORGUE - DAY
N: Teresa's body is on the platform in the middle of the room, Stanley hangs his recorder on the hooks at the end of the autopsy table and puts on rubber gloves. Desmond opens Teresa Banks file.
C: DESMOND
D: Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon Trailer Park for a month. We'll check that. And worked as a waitress at Hap's Truck Stop. Worked the Night Shift. Good place for dinner when we're thru here, Sam. No one came to claim the body and no known next of kin.
E: reading flips to another page
N: As Desmond is doing this, Stanley takes out his SPECIAL MACHINE. Desmond looks up from his work and notices.
C: STANLEY
D: Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
C: DESMOND
D: That's what I heard.
C: STANLEY
D: No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
C: DESMOND
D: That's good.
C: STANLEY
D: Yes, it is good. What do you think is in these other drawers?
E: looks around
C: DESMOND
D: I don't know, Sam.
C: STANLEY
D: Maybe, later we could take a look.
C: DESMOND
D: Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
N: Getting to work, Stanley's face goes right over Teresa's.
C: STANLEY
D: Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
E: into his recorder
C: DESMOND
D: Cole said she was 17.
N: Stanley's eyes drift to Teresa's left hand.
C: STANLEY
D: I wonder where her ring is?
N: Desmond notices the mark on her hand as well.
C: DESMOND
D: Yeah. Personal effects include a watch, under garments, and a blue waitress uniform... the ring is missing. It says the rest of her things haven't been removed yet from the trailer. Let's hope it's there.
E: looking into the personal effects
N: Stanley picks up her left hand. INSERT: BANKS LEFT HAND In Stanley's hand. ON THE SCENE
C: STANLEY
D: There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
C: DESMOND
D: Oh.
N: Stanley peers underneath the fingernail.
C: STANLEY
D: A laceration.
N: Stanley brings over his "Whiteman" instrument. Works the left hand under it.
C: DESMOND
D: Accidental?
C: STANLEY
D: Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
N: He gets whatever it is with a long set of tweezers.
C: DESMOND
D: What is it?
C: STANLEY
D: It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
N: Desmond comes around and takes a look. On a piece of paper. CLOSEUP: DESMOND Pondering what he has seen. ON THE SCENE We move across to a clock on the wall that reads: 5:04.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE SAME CLOCK It now reads 3:33. Stanley zips up a regulation body bag around Teresa.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 18. EXT. MORGUE - LATE NIGHT
N: Desmond and Stanley come out of the morgue.
C: STANLEY
D: Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
C: DESMOND
D: We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
C: STANLEY
D: Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
N: Desmond takes a long look at Stanley. STANLEY (continued) You've got your own M.O., don't you, Agent Desmond? Desmond gets in and starts the car.
S: 19. EXT. HAP'S DINER - LATE NIGHT
N: Establish.
S: 20. INT. HAP'S DINER, MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT
N: Desmond and Stanley talk with JACK, the manager who has black wavy hair with a black full mustache to match, shiny silk shirt with silver strands sown in and an Indian turquoise belt. He has a sign on his shirt that says, "Say 'Goodbye' to JACK". A GUY in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and shorting out. He doesn't really know what he's doing so he is poking at the wiring.
C: JACK
D: Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
C: DESMOND
D: Where's Hap?
C: JACK
D: He's dead - good and dead.
C: DESMOND
D: Sorry to hear it.
C: JACK
D: He didn't suffer.
C: DESMOND
D: I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
C: JACK
D: Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
C: DESMOND
D: Any friends?
C: JACK
D: No.
C: DESMOND
D: Ever see her with someone else?
C: JACK
D: No.
C: DESMOND
D: Did she ever mention any friends?
C: JACK
D: No. Ask Irene over there.
E: pointing
N: He gestures thru a door that leads out to the diner, pointing out a woman behind the counter. JACK (continued) Now, her name _is_ Irene and it _is_ night. Don't take it any further than that. There's nothin' good about it.
S: 21. INT. HAP'S DINER - SAME
N: They sit at the counter and IRENE comes over to them. Behind her is the coffee and she is working on a cigarette. Lipstick smeared on the coffee cup.
C: IRENE
D: Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place - you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
C: DESMOND
D: How come Jack let's you work here?
C: IRENE
D: Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
C: DESMOND
D: Say no more.
N: Stanley is casing the restaurant as Irene pours them a couple of cups of coffee.
C: DESMOND
D: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
E: showing credentials
C: IRENE
D: She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
N: She makes a sniff to indicate a "cocaine problem". IRENE (continued) Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
C: DESMOND
D: What happened to her?
C: IRENE
D: There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
C: DESMOND
D: Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
C: IRENE
D: No.
C: DESMOND
D: Do you take cocaine, Irene?
C: IRENE
D: No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
C: STANLEY
D: Nicotine is a drug. Caffeine is a drug.
C: IRENE
D: Who's Shorty? Those drugs are legal.
C: DESMOND
D: He's with me. Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
E: back on the track
C: IRENE
D: I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
C: DESMOND
D: Thanks.
N: An OLD GUY, long and skinny, smoking, gets Desmond's attention.
C: OLD GUY
D: You talking about that little girl that was murdered?
C: DESMOND
D: You have something to tell us?
C: OLD GUY
D: Yeah.
C: DESMOND
D: What?
C: OLD GUY
D: I can tell shit from shinolah. Gets me along way down that road.
N: Desmond moves away from him.
C: STANLEY
D: You think we ought to question him?
N: Desmond looks down at the coffee cup in Stanley's _left_hand_.
C: DESMOND
D: What time is it, Stanley?
N: Stanley checks his watch pouring hot coffee on himself.
C: STANLEY
D: Oh...
N: Desmond guides his laugh into a cough.
C: STANLEY
D: Agent Desmond, it's...
E: looking at his watch while his legs burn
C: DESMOND
D: It's late, Sam.
C: STANLEY
D: It's not late, it's early. Really early.
E: to himself as be dabs his pants with napkins
N: Irene comes up to them with her purse in her hand. She is going off duty.
C: IRENE
D: You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
C: DESMOND
D: What do you mean?
C: IRENE
D: Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking. I just thought I ought to tell you.
E: after a beat
C: DESMOND
D: Thanks.
N: Stanley watches her leave.
C: STANLEY
D: I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
C: DESMOND
D: I think that's a good idea.
S: 22. EXT. HAP'S DINER - NEAR DAWN
N: As Desmond and Stanley head towards their car.
C: DESMOND
D: I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
C: STANLEY
D: Are you speaking to me in a code?
C: DESMOND
D: No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
C: STANLEY
D: In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
N: Irene walks past them and towards the parking lot.
C: STANLEY AND DESMOND
D: Thanks, Irene. Good... Good morning.
E: catch themselves
C: STANLEY
D: Thank god it is morning.
S: 23. EXT. CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAWN
N: Desmond and Stanley drive thru to the manager's trailer which is surrounded by a small white picket fence. They park and step to the trailer. Desmond knocks twice on the door. From inside they hear a voice that makes Cole's voice sound like a whisper.
C: VOICE
D: OH, GOD, WHAT... WHAT...
N: Just then Desmond and Stanley notice a sign on the door that reads. "DO NOT EVER DISTURB BEFORE 9 A.M... EVER"
C: VOICE
D: CAN'T YOU READ!
C: STANLEY
D: Nine's really late. We are really early.
N: They both fumble for their badges as they hear the manager coming closer to the door. They meet the manager, CARL RODD.
C: CARL
D: God damn, this better be important.
N: He stops in the middle of this when he sees the badges.
C: DESMOND
D: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
C: CARL
D: More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse. GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
E: takes one step out of his trailer
N: Carl steps thru the little picket fence's gate and leads them towards Teresa's Trailer. CARL (continued) Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
C: DESMOND
D: Did she have someone with her?
C: CARL
D: Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
C: DESMOND
D: Was there an argument?
C: CARL
D: Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
C: DESMOND
D: Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
C: CARL
D: No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite-Able"... Here's the trailer now.
N: He swings open the door. CARL (continued) And this is exactly the way she left it. I never touched a GOD DAMN THING. (frustration rising) GOD! Desmond and Stanley go in.
S: 24. INT. TERESA'S TRAILER
N: Desmond smells the room. He and Stanley look around. Stanley leans over to Desmond.
C: STANLEY
D: She lived alone.
E: whispers
C: DESMOND
D: She must have known someone.
N: Desmond notices her personal effects on the dresser, but no ring. DESMOND (continued) You better dust this place, Sam.
C: STANLEY
D: I'll get my kit.
S: 25. EXT. CANYON TRAILER COURT
N: Stanley walks towards the car. He writes in his note book.
C: STANLEY
D: 5,600 dollars.
E: to himself
S: 26. INT. TERESA'S TRAILER
N: Desmond notices a picture hanging on the wall. Takes the picture down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass. (more) INSERT - PICTURE Teresa Banks is wearing a ring. BACK ON THE SCENE Stanley returns with his equipment. Desmond shows him the photograph.
C: DESMOND
D: Take a look at this.
C: STANLEY
D: She's wearing a ring.
N: Stanley studies it.
C: DESMOND
D: My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
C: STANLEY
D: May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond? There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
E: squinting at the picture takes a look, then looks at Desmond
N: Carl leans in from the outside.
C: CARL
D: I'm gonna make myself some Good Morning America. You want some?
N: Both nod "yes".
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 27. INT. TERESA'S TRAILER - LATER
N: Stanley is finishing up his work. Carl brings them their coffee. Desmond tastes the coffee under Sam's watchful eye.
C: DESMOND
D: You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
C: CARL
D: That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
C: STANLEY
D: We really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, Agent Desmond? We really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, Agent Desmond?
E: watching Desmond drink after a long look from Desmond
N: A WOMAN sticks her head into the trailer. She has an ice pack over one eye and a load of idle curiosity. Desmond notices her.
C: DESMOND
D: Did you know Teresa Banks?
N: She just nods in the negative and leans back out. Behind her is Deputy Cliff, who looks into the trailer.
C: CLIFF
D: Hey, how's J. Edgar doin'? Bet you appreciate them bustin' your mornin' in half, eh, Carl? Bet they woke you up.
E: to Carl
C: CARL
D: They're only doing their job.
C: DESMOND
D: What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
C: CLIFF
D: Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
C: DESMOND
D: Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
C: CLIFF
D: You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
C: CARL
D: Maybe if you did a little less partyin' that little girl would still be alive.
C: CLIFF
D: Is that right, Mr. Jack Daniels?
C: DESMOND
D: Did you know Teresa Banks?
C: CLIFF
D: Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
C: DESMOND
D: No you couldn't.
N: Chet steps towards Cliff who looses his balance and has to step off the trailer steps.
S: 28. EXT. CANYON TRAILER COURT - SAME
N: Desmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get into his car and drive to work. Stepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath. He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball.
C: DESMOND
D: Is there a golf course around here?
C: CARL
D: Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
N: Desmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to Stanley who puts it in his kit. Desmond turns to Carl.
C: DESMOND
D: Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
C: CARL
D: That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
N: Desmond and Stanley nod to Carl and walk to their car.
C: STANLEY
D: I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
C: DESMOND
D: He's not the murderer. But he's a bozo.
E: after a beat
C: STANLEY
D: Yes, he is like a clown.
N: Desmond walks around the car to the drivers' side and gets in.
S: 29. EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MIDDAY
N: The FBI MOBILE CRIME VAN sits outside as Desmond and Stanley pull up.
S: 30. INT. WAITING ROOM, SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Cable and Cliff meet Desmond and Stanley as they come in the door. The CRIME VAN DRIVER sits nearby. The secretary is behind her desk.
C: CABLE
D: What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
C: DESMOND
D: We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
C: CABLE
D: Maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_ things.
C: DESMOND
D: Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
C: CABLE
D: We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
C: DESMOND
D: Sam, get the body and put it in the van. Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
E: turning to Stanley to Cable
C: CABLE
D: My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
E: flexing the muscles in his arm
N: He reaches out and stops Stanley from going out to get the body. Cable smiles menacingly at Desmond. CABLE (continued) Cliff told me you asked him the same thing. Why don't we step around back and we'll have our final "discussion" out doors. Cable exits followed by Cliff and the giggling secretary.
C: STANLEY
D: When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
E: coming close to Desmond
C: DESMOND
D: I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
S: 31. EXT. BEHIND THE SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
N: Desmond, Cliff, Stanley, Cable, the secretary and the FBI van driver all have stepped outside by the pile of iron bars.
C: CABLE
D: Now, J. Edgar, I'm going to take off my badge, here. Do you mind? The only way you're going to get that body is over mine.
E: takes his badge off
N: He picks up a steel bar and bends it ala the picture in his office.
C: CLIFF
D: You try that you little monkey.
E: to Desmond
C: DESMOND
D: I think I'll take off my badge as well.
N: Desmond takes his coat and badge off. Cable takes his shirt off and Desmond follows. Cable is bare-chested and Desmond is in FBI issue underwear. Desmond goes to pick up an iron bar and Cable hits him with a sucker punch. As Desmond bends away from this Cable rushes at him. Desmond stops him with a few well placed punches to his face. Cable falls down and Desmond stands over him. Chet picks up the steel bar and bends it. He then tosses the bar away. Cable stands up and rushes at Desmond who flips and flops him around. Cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which Desmond expertly ducks.
C: DESMOND
D: This one's comin' from J. Edgar.
E: eyeing Cable's glass jaw
N: Desmond blasts him in the jaw and Cable goes over - lights out, all systems down. The no longer giggling secretary and Cliff stand and stare. Desmond looks at them.

D: Take the van back to Portland, Stanley. I'm going to take one more look at the trailer park.
N: They walk towards the van until Stanley stops.
C: STANLEY
D: One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
E: confidentially
C: DESMOND
D: Faulty wiring.
C: STANLEY
D: Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond? I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
E: extends his hand
C: DESMOND
D: Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
C: STANLEY
D: We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
N: Desmond smiles at Stanley as they shake. DESMOND'S POV As he enters the van, Desmond can barely make out what Stanley says as he points to the driver.

C: CHET
D: Right.
C: CARL
D: I'll be in my trailer if you need me.
N: Carl walks away towards his trailer. Desmond walks over and around Cliff's red trailer. He gets a strange feeling. He looks past Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a HAND appear in the window of a trailer. Then the hand disappears. Desmond walks to that trailer. He knocks on the door but no one answers. He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_ _a_small_indentation_at_the_top_. In the indentation is _Teresa_ _Bank's_ring_. As he reaches out and touches it, _he_disappears_.

N: The phone rings and Cole answers it.
S: 35. INT. PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICES
N: AGENT DALE COOPER, in the doorway across the hall, talks to DIANE in the next room. While he talks he does some isometrics against the door frame.
C: COOPER
D: I know you haven't changed your hair and I've seen that beautiful dress before, but I must say, Diane, you look sensational today.
N: Diane says something else that we cannot hear.
C: COOPER
D: No, I am not trying to buy time. It's Thursday and I know you have changed something in the room... and this time you've done very well... And I am going to tell you exactly what it is... in a moment... you have moved... Got it! It's the clock, you've moved it 12 inches to the left. Another triumph for the dashing Agent Cooper. And you, Diane, now have to clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground coffee from Sally and make a damn great pot of coffee.
E: enjoying this stalling snaps his fingers a laugh
N: Cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join Cole and Albert. But Cole's stern look takes his smile away.
C: COOPER
D: What is it, Gordon?
C: COLE
D: COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
S: 36. INT. SAM STANLEY'S APARTMENT, SPOKANE - DAY
N: All around the walls of Stanley's apartment are work benches with adding machinery sitting on top of them. In the middle of the room is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks. From one odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the pool. Cooper's eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks about Desmond.
C: STANLEY
D: Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
C: COOPER
D: Anything else?
C: STANLEY
D: Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
C: COOPER
D: I'm up to speed, Stanley.
C: STANLEY
D: Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
C: COOPER
D: And neither will I.
C: STANLEY
D: Oh, alright. You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
E: understanding reflecting
N: Stanley turns to one of his work tables and shows Cooper the Whiteman machine.
C: STANLEY
D: I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
C: COOPER
D: Stanley, I heard all about it.
E: trying to stop him
C: STANLEY
D: No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
C: COOPER
D: Tell me about the letter.
C: STANLEY
D: Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
N: Cooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on Teresa.
C: COOPER
D: And no one found the ring?
C: STANLEY
D: No, sir, we did not.
N: Cooper straightens up from the microscope. Stanley extends his hand.
C: STANLEY
D: I'm Sam Stanley, if you ever need me.
S: 37. EXT. CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAY
N: Carl Rodd shows Cooper to Teresa's trailer.
C: CARL
D: GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer... After that I never saw him again.
E: gestures to the red trailer gestures back to his
C: COOPER
D: Thank you, Carl.
N: Cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond.
C: CARL
D: That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
E: turning back
C: COOPER
D: I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
C: CARL
D: Well, where are you going?
C: COOPER
D: I am going over here.
C: CARL
D: God damn, you people are confusing.
E: coming along with him
N: Cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks.
C: COOPER
D: What was here, Mr. Rodd?
C: CARL
D: A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
C: COOPER
D: Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
C: CARL
D: An old woman and her grandson.
C: COOPER
D: Can you tell me what their names were?
C: CARL
D: Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
N: Cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer. As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence of SOMETHING. Cooper struggles to his feet and looks around. Under a tree and close to the tracks is a car.
C: COOPER
D: Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
C: CARL
D: Yep, it sure is.
N: Cooper walks to it. AT DESMOND'S CAR Cooper inspects the car. Coming around to the front of the car he notices the windshield. On the windshield someone has written the words, "Let's Rock".
S: 38. EXT. WIND RIVER, NEAR DEER MEADOW - AFTERNOON
N: Cooper stares into the stream.
C: COOPER
D: Diane, it's 4:20 in the afternoon. I am standing here at Wind River where they found the body of Teresa Banks. Diane, this case has got a strange feeling for me. Not only has Agent Chester Desmond disappeared but this is one of Cole's Blue Rose cases. The clues that were found by Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley have lead to dead ends. The letter below the fingernail gives me the feeling that the killer will strike again. But like the song says, "...who knows where or when".

She goes to her "public" diary which she keeps on her desk. Opens it to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine. Like a pro she takes out her "cocaine gadget" from her purse and takes a snort. Then another. Big sigh of relief. Now she moves to her "private" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen, ready to write and starts to freak out. Pages are missing. First, she discovers one, then more.

S: 79. INT. PALMER DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Laura is already at the table. Sarah puts the rest of the dinner on the table and sits down just as LELAND PALMER enters from the kitchen. He is pretending he is a giant. Using a voice like a giant.
C: LELAND
D: Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe? "I'm hungry".
E: big giant voice singing
C: SARAH
D: Oh, Leland.
C: LAURA
D: Dad.
E: embarrassed
C: LELAND
D: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
E: suddenly speaking Norwegian
N: Translation is: How are you? My name is Leland Palmer. Laura and Sarah stare at him.
C: LELAND
D: The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
C: LAURA
D: But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
C: SARAH
D: Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
C: LELAND
D: This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
N: Leland repeats his phrase for Sarah's benefit.
C: LELAND
D: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
N: Sarah stumbles through it.
C: SARAH
D: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Sarah Palmer.
N: Leland repeats his phrase back to her. Extends his hand in a friendly handshake.

C: LAURA
D: Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Laura Palmer.
N: After Laura is done.
C: LELAND

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 80. INT. LAURA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT
N: The clock reads: 11:30. Laura's hands open the window and release the screen. Laura silently sneaks out the window and down the side of her house.
S: 81. EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - LATER
N: A big semi comes to a stop at a wide spot in the road. Laura climbs into the truck.
S: 82. INT. TRUCK - SAME
N: The TRUCKER smiles. Eager.
C: TRUCKER
D: Friend of Leo's, right? Partyland?
N: Laura begins to unbutton her blouse. Turns and sneaks a toot of cocaine. TRUCKER (continued) (catching her) Wait a minute. Leo says this is my party. Laura puts her hand between his legs.
C: LAURA
D: If you can fuck and drive the party starts right now.
N: Momentarily taken aback, the trucker stares at her. Laura takes his hand and puts it on the gear shift. LAURA (continued) You shift that one. This one's mine. She climbs over on top of him.
S: 83. EXT. THE TRUCK - SAME
N: The stack blows. The truck rolls away onto the road. We watch it as it moans into the distance - the sound slowly diminishing and fading. Natures' nighttime sounds take over. Finally, we hear the _hooting_ _of_an_owl_.

N: Reestablish.
S: 85. INT. OFFICE - DAY
N: Albert and Cooper.
C: ALBERT
D: Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
C: COOPER
D: The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
C: ALBERT
D: Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
C: COOPER
D: Albert.
C: ALBERT
D: You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
C: COOPER
D: Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
C: ALBERT
D: Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
C: COOPER
D: A woman.
C: ALBERT
D: What color hair will she have?
C: COOPER
D: Blonde.
C: ALBERT
D: Tell me some other things about her.
C: COOPER
D: She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
C: ALBERT
D: You're describing half the high school girls in America. What is she doing right now?
E: off Cooper's look
C: COOPER
D: She is preparing a great abundance of food.
E: closing his eyes to see a mental picture

C: GRANDSON
D: He's looking for a book with pages torn out. He's walking towards the hiding place. He's moving under the fan now.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals. Laura turns back to her and then back to the Tremonds, who are walking away from her and are farther away than they realistically could be. Laura comes to Shelly in a panic.

D: Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
N: Shelly leaves the diner. ON NORMA In the empty diner Norma walks over and sits in a booth. She studies the empty diner. After a while the cook, TOAD, calls from the kitchen. A distant forlorn call.

D: What? It can't be... It can't be him... no... no...
E: frantic whisper
N: Laura is coming apart, sobbing. Behind her, on the sidewalk, a NEIGHBOR has noticed her.
C: WOMAN
D: Laura...
N: A closer look reveals how upset Laura is.
C: WOMAN
D: What... Laura are you all right?
N: Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying. The woman takes a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass.
C: LAURA
D: I... lost my necklace... it must have fallen.
E: trying to hold it together
N: Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace. She pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already around her neck.

D: Oh, here it is.
E: clumsily
N: Woman moves back to the sidewalk.

C: DOC
D: The red rose. Where is the red rose? You know the light at Sparkwood and 21? It worked right there. I just did it right there.
E: frustrated

As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark doorway in the room in the picture. On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room. Mrs. Tremond is standing in that room. She is beckoning us towards her and beyond her thru yet another doorway. We move thru the second doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room. Mrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room. He is holding his hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball. As we move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there and we move thru that into...

N: The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and makes an Indian Whooping sound. The Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close to us. We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring. The symbols on the ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave. Cooper seems concerned.
C: COOPER
D: Don't take the ring... Laura, don't take the ring.
E: to camera
N: The Man From Another Place moves the ring towards us till the ring fills the screen. 114. BACK IN LAURA'S ROOM Laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise.

ON LAURA She turns to her right to see who it is, then turning back to her left she discovers ANNIE BLACKBURN lying in bed with her. Annie has blood around her mouth. She tries to raise herself and strains to speak.
C: ANNIE
D: My name is Annie. I've been with Laura and Dale. The good Dale is in the lodge and he can't leave. Write it in your diary.
N: ON LAURA'S DOOR Her mother calls her name. The sound is distant and mournful. ON LAURA Laura looks towards her door then turns back to Annie but she is gone. Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring. SHE SCREAMS. Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her mother's distant call.

C: TRUMAN
D: What are you afraid of? What people think?
C: JOSIE
D: I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
C: TRUMAN
D: Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
C: JOSIE
D: Fish eyes?
C: TRUMAN
D: Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
C: JOSIE
D: Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
C: TRUMAN
D: I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
N: He plays the guitar for Josie. Then stops. TRUMAN (continued) I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
C: JOSIE
D: I understand.
C: TRUMAN
D: We throw away the _whole_ head.
