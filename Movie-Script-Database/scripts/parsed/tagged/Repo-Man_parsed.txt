N: Repo Man theme music now begins playing. Map is shown in background (green text on black background), zoomed in on Los Alamos, New Mexico. While remaining credits are shown, the map travels to Sante Fe, then Albuquerque, then begins following US66 west through Arizona to California, finally ending up a few miles east of Goffs (northwest of Needles). Green '64 Chevy Malibu Malibu is weaving down the highway in the desert, passes billboard with motorcycle cop behind it. Cop pulls out behind Malibu.
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Forty-niner and his daughter Clementine. Oh my darlin, oh my darlin...
N: Motorcycle cop pulls the car over, gets off motorcycle and raps on car window.
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Clementine Clemen-
C: COUNTY SHERIFF
D: Let me see your drivers license.
C: RADIO
D: Post ten-eighteen. Post ten-eighteen.
C: COUNTY SHERIFF
D: From out of town, hmm? What's you got in the trunk?
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: oah...you don't want to look in there.
C: COUNTY SHERIFF
D: Give me the keys.
N: The motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens the trunk. The car has New Mexico license plates KBB-283. In every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will be 127-GBH.
C: COUNTY SHERIFF
D: AHHHHHH!
N: The motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith). Parnell watches from side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses have no lens.
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Oh my darlin Clementine, you are lost now gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine.
N: Otto and Kevin, in the supermarket, facing cans of generic yellow cling sliced peaches.
C: KEVIN
D: Do Do Do De Do De Do De Do De Do Feeling Do De Da Do De Do De Do Feeling seven-up. I'm feeling seven-up. Feeling seven up. I'm feeling seven up. It's a crisp refreshing feeling crystal clear and light. America's drinking seven-up and it sure feels right. Feeling lucky seven.
N: Otto puts price sticker on Kevin's glasses.
C: OTTO
D: Kevin stop singing man.
C: KEVIN
D: Feeling seven eleven.
C: KEVIN

E: flippin
C: KEVIN
D: Jeeze. Why so tense guy?
C: MR. HUMPHRIES
D: Otto?
C: KEVIN
D: Mister Humphries!
C: MR. HUMPHRIES
D: You were late again this morning. Now normally I'd let it go but it's been brought to my attention that you're not paying attention to the way you space the cans. Many young men of your age in these uncertain times-
C: MR. HUMPHRIES
D: Otto! Are you paying attention to me?
C: LOUIE
D: Hey! He's talking to you!
N: Kevin chuckles Otto grabs Kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used to make the shot work). Louie pulls his gun.
C: LOUIE
E: Basta!
C: KEVIN
D: You gotta love getting fired from your job in a big way, Otto.
C: MR. HUMPHRIES
D: What are you laughing at? Louie, throw him out too.
C: LOUIE
D: Come on you worm. Get out of here.
N: Louie shoves Kevin down aisle where Otto is walking out. Otto takes off his clip-on bow tie and tosses it back towards Louie. Louie twirls his gun and puts it away. Note that the store aisle is lined with nothing but generic products, plain black lettering on white background. All products in movie from now on will have this appearance. Punks slamdancing to Coup D'etat in the back of a warehouse. Otto is there slamdancing and Duke walks up, the two of them swing each other around. Behind them, the graffiti on the wall says "Circle Jerks", a band which will appear later in the movie.
C: OTTO
D: How you doing dude? When did you get out of the slammer man?
N: Otto enters bedroom where Debbi is waiting in bed.
C: DEBBI
D: What's the difference? ]
C: OTTO
D: Huh?
N: Otto lays back on the bed and puts his hands behind his head.
C: OTTO
D: okay
N: Debbi pulls back his shirt a little and begins kissing his stomach, then stops.
C: DEBBI
D: Otto. Otto.
C: OTTO
D: What?
C: DEBBI
D: Get me another beer.
N: Otto goes downstairs and there's a party going on. Institutionalized plays in background.
C: KEVIN
D: Ow. Cool. Ow. Dammit. I'm supposed to be the host here.
C: KEVIN
D: Ow!
N: Otto returns to the bedroom
C: OTTO
D: Debbi honey. I got you a beer.
N: Otto turns on light and finds Duke there with Debbi.
C: [OTTO
D: Shit.
C: DEBBI
D: Just ignore him Duke he's nothing but a big baby.
C: DUKE
D: Turn the fucking light out.]
N: Otto leaves room just as Kevin arrives and looks in the door.
C: KEVIN
D: What are you doing? Nobody supposed to be up here. This is my parent's room.
N: Dude, nobody supposed to be up here, this is my parent's room.) [Otto in a vacant lot drinking a beer. It's early morning and Otto starts walking.
C: OTTO
D: Don't want to talk about anything else. We don't want to know. We're just dedicated...to our favorite shows. Saturday night live, Monday night football, Dallas, Jeffersons, Gilligan's island, Flintstones. ]
N: Otto still walking, but it's light now. Bud pulls up next to him in a blue sedan.

C: OTTO
D: Mother, father. Got anything to eat?
C: REVEREND LARRY
D: Occasionally we get a letter from a viewer that says now the only reason Reverend Larry comes on your television set is because he wants your money. And do you know what? They're right! I do want your money. Because god wants your money. So I want you to go out and mortgage that home and sell that car and send me your money. You don't need that car.

C: OTTO MOM
D: We're sending bibles to El Salvador.
N: Otto and Bud riding in Bud's car Jazz music plays on the radio. In almost all scenes inside of Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio. In this sequence the background changes from day to night, back to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) even though the dialog seems continuous. I believe that this was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed the continuity. It's clearer in the TV version where there truly is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting.
C: OTTO
D: So how much do I get paid, twenty-five buck a car.
C: BUD
D: Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, you work on commission, that's better than getting paid.
C: BUD
D: Most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar Porsche might make ya five grand.
E: german pronounciation
C: BUD
D: It helps if you dress like a detective, too. Detectives dress kind of square. People think this guy is a cop. They're going to think you're packing something. They don't fuck with you so much.
E: mess
C: OTTO
D: Are you?
C: BUD
D: Am I what?
C: OTTO
D: Packin' something.
C: BUD
D: Ha. Only an asshole gets killed for a car. Guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up at four. That's why there ain't a repo man I know that don't take speed.
E: a jackass
C: OTTO
D: Speed huh?
N: Bud at payphone Bud is talking on phone.
C: BUD
D: I'll call you back! Flippin general telephone.
E: hangs up
N: Bud picks up phone and dials. Phone begins making a loud whining noise. Bud gets sledgehammer from car and destroys phone while Otto watches. When Bud is done, Otto gets crowbar from car and beats side of phone with it while laughing.
C: BUD
D: C'mon.
N: Otto and Bud in car in alley (In the television version, this entire scene takes place while watching Bud's car drive down a road, but you can still hear the snorting in the background.)
C: [BUD SNORTING A LINE
D: Jesus Christ.]
C: BUD
D: Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That's what I call the repo code kid. Don't forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore.
C: BUD
D: Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those assholes over there.
E: that
N: We see a group of people around a tow truck with a car being hooked up to it.
C: BUD
D: Ordinary people I hate 'em.
C: OTTO
D: Me too.
C: BUD
D: What do you know? See an ordinary person spend his life avoiding tense situations. Repoman spends his life getting into tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink.
N: Otto and Bud in a store Bud sets 2 six packs of "drink" down on the counter.
C: BUD
D: Tense situations kid. Get into five or six of them a day and it don't mean shit anymore. I mean I seen men stabbed and it didn't mean shit . I've seen guns. Guns too they don't mean shit but that's when you got to watch your self. Here I'll handle it pal. Uh settle down.
E: zilch zilch zilch
C: BUD
D: Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day, it doesn't mean shit .
E: zilch
N: Duke, Archie, and Debbi rise from behind counter as Otto and Bud leave.
C: DUKE
D: Wasn't that Otto?
C: DEBBI
D: Otto who?
C: DUKE
D: You gotta watch yourself. Have a nice day . . . night.
E: takes off mask
N: Parnell drives Malibu across bridge Otto and Bud in front of house with tow truck
C: BUD
D: This is what I call phase 2 ace. If the dealer don't have the keys, you call the truck. And it is a heartbreak to be sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it away. Once you've got this baby on the hooks, she's all ours.
N: Man comes out of house with shaving cream on face.
C: PAKMAN
D: Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in the bud right now. You are not going to take this car. I know my rights. There is absolutely no way you're going to take it.
C: BUD
D: Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?
C: PAKMAN
D: Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann is my daughter. Now you're going to have to take this matter up with her.
C: BUD
D: Well don't think I haven't tried, sir, but she hasn't had the decency to call us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace this car all over town.
C: PAKMAN
D: Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn car isn't working anyway, and I know, I know that's why she hasn't paid you.
C: BUD
D: Well, she could have called us? Look, all you've go to do is call my branch manager, I will abide with whatever he says.
N: Bud hands Pakman a business card.
C: PAKMAN READING CARD
D: I. G. Farben. . . What do you take me for, a moron? If I go in there, you're going to take this car away.
C: BUD
D: What, and lose my job? The law requires that I stay right here until you call my branch manager.
C: PAKMAN
D: That's the law?
C: BUD
D: That's the law.
N: Pakman begins walking toward house.
C: PAKMAN
D: I'll be right back.
N: Pakman goes inside and Bud and Otto leave with the car as Pakman comes running back out of the house. Otto and Bud driving down a waterway
C: BUD
D: There's going to be some bad shit coming down one of these days kid.
E: stuff

C: OTTO

No matter how appealing do not let strange creature in you house. We all know strange creatures are on the increase.

C: OTTO
D: United fruitcake outlet.
C: LEILA
D: My door doesn't open.
N: Otto lets Leila out
C: LEILA

C: OTTO
D: Sure Ummm I don't know. what do you think? Ah want to go out with me again sometime?
C: LEILA
D: I don't know. I'm going to be kind of busy with work, the Malibu and everything.

E: Flip me
C: LEILA
D: You wanna get back in the car?
C: OTTO
D: What, here?
C: LEILA
D: Yeah.
N: Squeals are heard from the back seat of the car Back at the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation
C: OLY
D: Twenty thousand dollars for a Chevy Malibu?
C: OLY
D: Who's double X finance?
C: MARLENE
D: Store front operation, but the money is in escrow.
C: MARLENE
D: Want me to notify the boys?
C: OLY
D: Uh, naw. They're always bitching about their case load. I think I'll go out for a while.
E: crying
C: MARLENE
D: Why? We out of beer?
C: OLY
D: Somebody has to work around here. Keep making me money kid.
C: OTTO
D: Fuck you.
E: flip
N: Otto and Lite out in the field
C: LITE
D: Man we've been looking for this little red devil for a long time. Just act natural. Nobody knows if its your car or somebody elses car.
C: LITE
D: Now you work with that. You give it a try. All right?
C: LITE
D: Let me give you a hand we dont have a whole year to find it boy.
C: OTTO
D: Got it.
N: They slimjim the car and get in
C: LITE
D: Lets get out of here. Put your seat belt on.
C: LITE
D: Put your seat belt on boy! I don't ride with anybody unless they wear their seatbelt. It's one of my rules.
N: Otto, going through Lite's briefcase, picks up gun.
C: LITE
D: Put that damn gun down boy. It ain't no toy.
N: Driving away in the car
C: LITE
D: I walk into someone's place of work. They shit scared. They know I'm not a cop. They think I've come to kill 'em and I would. I'd kill anybody who crosses me. You know what I mean?
E: plum
N: Otto goes through glove compartment, puts on pair of sunglasses he finds there (reference to the movie Kings of the Road with cinematography by Robby Mueller). Lite puts a lighter to the cigarette in his mouth, but fails to light it. A few moments later he does it again and succeeds in getting it lit.
C: LITE
D: Do you like music?
C: OTTO
D: Sure.
C: LITE
D: In that case you're going love this.
N: Lite puts cassette in player. Lite's Theme starts playing.
C: LITE
D: I was into these dudes before anybody. Partied with them all the time. Asked me to be their manager. I called bullshit on that. Managing a pop group hey that ain't no job for no man.
E: no way
N: Otto sees boxes wrapped in ribbons in back seat and hands one to Lite who throws it out window. A car runs over box and we see that it is full of money. Otto continues throwing boxes out of the window.
C: LITE
D: You read that book I gave you?
C: OTTO
D: What book?
C: LITE
D: Dioretix. Science of matter over mind.
C: OTTO
D: Unh uhg
C: LITE
D: You'd better read it and quick. That book will change your life. Found it in a Maseratti in Beverly hills.
N: Otto and Miller in vacant lot under bridge
C: MILLER
D: A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll Give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.
C: OTTO
D: You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the hippie days?
C: MILLER
D: I'll give you another instance. You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now. Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how the Mayans invented television. That kind of thing.
C: OTTO
D: I don't read them books.
C: MILLER
D: Well the way I see it it's exactly the same. There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine. People get so hung up on specifics. They miss out on seeing the whole thing. Take South America for example. In South America thousands of people go missing every year. Nobody knows where they go. They just like disappear. But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something. There had to be a time when there was no people. Right?
C: OTTO
D: Yeah. I guess.
C: MILLER
D: Well where did all these people come from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The future. Where did all these people disappear to? hmmm?
C: OTTO
D: The past?
C: MILLER
D: That's right and how did they get there?
C: OTTO
D: How the fuck do I know?
E: hell
C: MILLER
D: Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah you got it. Time machines. I think a lot about this kind of stuff. I do my best thinking on the bus. That how come I don't drive, see?
C: OTTO
D: You don't even know how to drive.
C: MILLER
D: I don't want to know how. I don't want to learn. See? The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.
N: In Bud's car driving through a tunnel
C: BUD
D: You know I think I saw one of those things once. One of those UFOs. I mean it was really it was kind of kind of scary. I saw all these colored lights and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights like I never heard before. I mean it was really weird.
C: OTTO
D: Bud.
C: BUD
D: Yeah?
C: OTTO
D: Do you think all repo men follow the code?
C: BUD
D: Of course. Well I mean you see a lot of fucked up cars come in but...99 time out of 100 it was the customer who fucked them up. Assholes .

E: hell
C: BUD
D: It's a grand if you show me where his car is Napoleon.
C: [NAPOLEON
D: Ahh. Go fuck yourself asshole.]
C: BUD
D: Hello? Prick .
E: Jerk
N: Inside the Rodriguez brothers' place, Napoleon looking at repo sheet on Malibu, which Marlene brought to them.
C: NAPOLEON
D: Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand.
C: BUD
D: Waiting!
C: NAPOLEON
D: We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene.
C: MARLENE
D: Think you can find it now?
C: BUD IN THE STREET
D: I'm not going anywhere.
C: NAPOLEON
D: Now how come this junk is worth so much? What's in it? Drugs?
C: BUD IN THE STREET
D: Got all night amigo!
C: LAGARTO
D: Los Hermanos Rodriguez don't approve of drugs.
C: MARLENE
D: Neither do I, but it's my birthday.
C: BUD IN THE STREET
D: I'm going to get your .
C: [MARLENE
D: That motherfucker's still down there.]
N: Bud in the street in front of the Rodriguez brother's house
C: BUD
D: Don't care how long it takes, dildos . Repo man's got all night every night.
E: jerks
N: Brothers make paper airplane of repo sheet and float it down to Bud. Bud picks it up and reads it.
C: BUD
D: twenty thousand dollars.
N: Agent Rogersz listening to Leila and Otto on the phone
C: OTTO
D: Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto. The guy who gave you a ride and stuff. I heard something about that car.
N: Leila and Otto at the United Fruitcake Outlet Leila takes Otto into a cinderblock room which has a neon sculpture on the wall and in the center of the room, standing on a pedestal, is a humorous statue of what could be a humanoid type alien.
C: LEILA
D: Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something to tell me.
C: LEILA
D: Otto? Otto!
C: OTTO
D: Huh?
C: LEILA
D: What did you want to tell me?
C: OTTO
D: Oh! Take off your clothes.
C: LEILA
D: I'm at work, Otto!
C: OTTO
D: Oh yeah? Me too.
C: LEILA
D: Your work is different than mine.
C: OTTO
D: Says who?
N: Otto takes down his pants (according to the filmmakers, Estevez enjoyed doing this on a regular basis. Maybe they were just joking?).
C: LEILA
D: What are you doing.? Don't do that.
C: [OTTO
D: Well the least you could do is give me a blow job.
N: Leila slaps Otto
C: OTTO
D: Heh, I guess that means no.]
C: DEADRA
D: Leila? We have a cell meeting in two minutes time.
C: LEILA
D: Thanks Deadra. I'll be right there.
N: Bud and Lite parked in their cars side by side
C: BUD
D: See that motherfucker only thinks I don't know what's going on, Lite. As soon as I find that Chevy I'm going indy. I'm going to buy myself a tow truck, a couple of pitbulls, and run a yard. Sit around and watch everybody else do the work for a while .
E: melonfarmer change
N: Lite lights up a roach.
C: LITE
D: No way you can do that on twenty grand man.
C: BUD
D: The hell I can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless.
N: The hell I can't, as long as your credit record's good and mine is spotless.)
C: LITE
D: If I find the Malibu, you won't see me for dust, I'm going to move to Mendecino County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato plants.
N: Bud and Otto in a car
C: BUD
D: Credit is a sacred trust. It's what our free society is founded on. You think they give a damn about their bills in Russia? I said do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?
C: OTTO
D: They don't pay bills in Russia. It's all free.
C: BUD
D: All free? Free my ass, what are you a fucking commie? Huh?
E: flippin
C: OTTO
D: No I ain't no commie.
C: BUD
D: Well you'd better not be I don't want any commies in my car. No Christians either.
N: Chevy Malibu exits car wash and pulls up to gas pumps. That's director Alex Cox wiping the car as it pulls away from the car wash and over to the pumps. The pumps at the gas station say "Pace Gas". Next to the pump is a campaign poster for Harry Pace, running for City Council. These posters appear elsewhere in the film. In his posters, Harry Pace has a happy face.
C: KEVIN
D: I'll deal with you later. I've got a customer to attend to. You too.
N: Kevin walks over to Malibu.
C: KEVIN
D: Hi! I'm Kevin. Vacuum sir?
C: KEVIN
D: Need a vacuum sir?
N: Parnell runs fingers through hair and pulls out a clump.
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Have you any machines?
C: KEVIN
D: You don't want to eat from a machine. Look, there's a nice Del Taco across the street. They've got enchurritos and everything.
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: But I do want to eat from a machine. Vended food contains all the necessary nutrients for survival. Taste damn good too, by golly. And plus, on any given evening, the machine that last night gave you cheetos might dispense instead... Doritos. Yohos. Oreos. Tosquitos . Or Lorna Doones.
E: tostitos?
C: KEVIN
D: Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones.
N: Parnell walks off screen and we hear puking sounds.
C: KEVIN
D: Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk? Scuze me.
N: Lagarto and Napoleon pull up in a car one other side of pumps. Latino music plays on their car radio.
C: KEVIN
D: Hi! I'm Kevin!
C: NAPOLEON
D: Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't you remember me? I was here yesterday. Heh. Listen I think I left a book of matches over in your office over there. You want to go and check for me huh?
C: KEVIN
D: Sure thing.
C: NAPOLEON
D: Hey thanks a lot buddy.
C: KEVIN
D: Any thing for you babes.
C: NAPOLEON
D: All right, you're beautiful. I love you.
C: KEVIN
D: I'll be right back.
N: Lagarto gets in the Malibu and both cars drive off. Kevin returns from inside and sees both cars gone. Two other attendants sit at a table and also look; the attendant on the right is director Alex Cox.
C: KEVIN
D: What??
N: Shot of car driving down freeway, passed by several motorcycles. Otto and Mrs. Parks in Mrs. Parks' living room
C: OTTO
D: It's really very simple Mrs. Parks. You don't want me to take your car and I don't want to take your car. Now I said to the boss I said ah Look! I do not want to repossess this ladys car.
N: Sound of motorcycles pulling up outside of house.
C: MRS. PARKS
D: Well I've been in the hospital you see.
C: OTTO
D: Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really on the line over this one. I could lose it right away.
C: MRS. PARKS
D: I'll see if I can borrow some money from somewhere.
C: OTTO
D: That's terrific. Really terrific.
N: Mrs. Park's son and his fellow band members enter
C: MRS. PARKS
D: Oh how was the rehearsal son?
C: MRS. PARKS' SON
D: It was O.K. Who's this?
C: MRS. PARKS
D: Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance company. He's been telling me that he isn't going to take the car this time, even though he could.
C: OTTO
D: Well, uh, gotta get going here.
N: Otto fumbles nervously with his briefcase trying to close it.
C: MRS. PARKS
D: Did you like the tea?
C: OTTO
D: The tea?
C: MRS. PARKS
D: Uh huh?
C: OTTO
D: Yeah, it was terrific.
C: OTTO
D: Thank you
C: MRS. PARKS
D: You're welcome.
C: OTTO
D: Uh excuse me.
N: Otto walks outside and gets in car. From outside we hear Mrs. Parks yelling at her son.
C: MRS. PARKS
D: I gave you the money last week to pay it and you didn't do it. What did you do with it? I'm so tired of giving you money and you squandering it. I know what you done you all went out dancing some where. That's what you did. Next time I give you some money I want you to put it in the car ya hear. You're working. How come you didn't do it huh? I don't know what's happened to you.
E: continues softly
N: Otto starts car and guns engine, but now we clearly see that the rear wheels are up on jacks (that it wasn't up on jacks before has been listed as a goof and even confirmed by Alex Cox, but I think they're wrong. It is hard to tell in the dark, but you can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the house which goes dark as a band member runs in front of it on the other side of the car, thus confirming that the car actually was up on jacks in all the scenes). Band members run out of house and pull Otto out of car.
C: OTTO
D: Hey it's cool. It's cool. I like music too man, hey
N: Otto gets beat up. One band member hits him twice over the head with a guitar, making an audible "kabong" noise. Supposedly you can hear one member saying "this one's for Keith Moon", but I've never been able to make it out. Miller, Plettschner and Otto in the lot. Miller is chanting and dancing like a native American as he puts a bandage on Otto's head.
C: PLETTSCHNER
D: Some people aren't cut out to be repo men. Why don't you smarten up kid?
C: OTTO
D: Fuck you Plettschner! OWW! OWW!
E: flip
C: PLETTSCHNER
D: Don't you say fuck you to me. Don't you know who I am?
E: flip
C: OTTO
D: Yeah you're Plettschner.
C: PLETTSCHNER
D: You're fucking right I'm Plettschner. Otto Plettschner. Three times decorated in two world wars. I was killing people while you were still swimming around in your father's balls . You little scum bag! I worked five years in a slaughter house and ten years as a prison guard in Attica.
E: flippin guts
C: OTTO
D: So what?
C: PLETTSCHNER
D: So what? So never say fuck you to me. Because you haven't earn the rights yet.
E: flip
N: Lite enters
C: LITE
D: Hey kid I need a contract driver.
C: PLETTSCHNER
D: See what I mean punk?
C: OTTO
D: Fuck you!
E: flip
C: PLETTSCHNER
D: Fuck you! You little scumbag.
E: What!
C: LITE
D: Shut up, Phlettschner.
C: PLETTSCHNER
D: Don't you ever tell me to shut up.
N: Lagarto and Napoleon in the Malibu They pull up in front of a diner.
C: NAPOLEON
D: Shit ! ! It's too hot in here man. What the hell's going on? So fucking hot I think that shit in the trunk is going to melt. I think we better take a look, all right?
E: shoot ? flippin
C: LAGARTO
D: Go get us two sodas.
C: NAPOLEON
D: All right, as soon as I check the trunk.
C: LAGARTO
D: We're just the mules, comprende? ...
E: Andale'
N: Lagarto calls Marlene from phone booth. A sign in the window of the diner behind him says "2.95 Plate O-Shrimp Luncheon Special".
C: MARLENE
D: Helping hand.
C: LAGARTO
D: Marlene! We've found the car.
N: Archie, Duke, and Debbie exit a window and go down a fire escape [dropping armloads of pills as they go]. Behind them, a sign says "Fox & Mac Taggert Pharmaceutical Company".
C: DUKE
D: Come on you guys!
C: DUKE
D: Get the lead out.
C: DEBBI
D: Stop pushing Duke.
C: [ARCHIE
D: My medication. Aw man!
C: DUKE
D: Aw be cool dude we got more.
C: ARCHIE
D: Come on. Come on. da-dee-dee-dee-dah-dah dee-dee...
E: continues to the tune of The Ride of the Valkyries
N: Lagarto on the phone with Marlene
C: LAGARTO
D: Yeah well that's not the only thing Marlene. This car is hot.
C: MARLENE
D: What do you mean? Stolen?
C: LAGARTO
D: No. No I mean it's hot really hot.
C: MARLENE
D: Hot?
C: LAGARTO
D: Yeah, we're sweating like pigs man.
C: MARLENE
D: I got the papers. Where is the car from?
C: LAGARTO
D: It's from someplace. Ah Roswell, New Mexico
N: Archie and Duke run by the Malibu. Debbie stops, whistles and gets in the car. Archie and Duke jump in and they drive off to the sound of a Latino version of The Ride of the Valkyries. Lagarto walks out of the phone booth just as this is happening and drops his clipboard in disgust. Napolean walks out of the store, silently hands Lagarto a soda, and they both stand there and sip their drinks through straws. Otto and Lite in a car The music from Bad Man is playing on the tape deck in Lite's car.
C: LITE
D: Me fight in a war man? Fuck no way! Nobody's got to do that shit. Not in this country. A new I.D. don't cost no more than a pink slip. You know what I mean?
E: hell
C: LITE
D: Something wrong?
C: OTTO
D: You know Marlene? Man she's pretty hot.
C: LITE
D: Otto my man. I jumped on that action from day one. I found out where she was coming from.
C: OTTO
D: See ya back at the yard.
C: LITE
D: Have fun.
N: Otto slimjims car and tries to start it. While bending down, window shatters from gunshot.
C: OTTO
D: Oh shit . Holy shit . Lite! . Lite! Lite! Lite! Lite! Open the door. There's a maniac in there. What are you doing? Open the door man! What are you doing? What are you doing? Open the door. Lite!
E: damn smoke
N: Lite gets out and starts shooting back. He fires 9 times (one or two of the shots doesn't flash like the others).
C: LITE
D: You're still on the job white boy. Get in the car.
C: OTTO
D: Open the door man, open the door. Open the door Lite.

C: OTTO
D: Well I don't know I mean that's pretty severe.

D: I can't hear you. I'm using the scrambler.
C: LEILA
D: Look out!
E: garbled noises in background
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: What?
N: A car swerves into the phone booth, then crosses street and hits a fire hydrant. The agents are trapped inside by the airbags. More agents appear and chase Leila
C: AGENT

N: In Agent Rogersz van An agent types while eating potato chips. The camera pans across the van to Agents Rogersz, who is watching a monitor which shows Leila being questioned

C: OTTO
D: Nuh-uh
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine, was a designer of the MX missile race track basing mode. A hundred thousand miles of railroad track on a big loop through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs were going to hide in locomotive sheds. That way the red team would never know exactly where they were. I still go out to Utah, just to think about the way things might have been.
C: OTTO
D: Sir. I represent the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation.
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Radiation, yes indeed! You hear the most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked goggle-boxed do-gooders telling everybody its bad for you. Pernicious nonsense! Everybody could stand a hundred chest X-rays a year. They ought to have 'em too. When they canceled the project it almost did me in. One day my mind was literally a-burst. The next day nothing. Swept away... But I showed them. I had a lobotomy in the end.
C: OTTO
D: Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies?
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Not at all. A friend of mine had one. Designer of the neutron bomb. Ever hear of the neutron bomb? Destroys people. Leaves buildings standing. It fits in a suit case. It's so small no one knows it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral working on the thing can drive you mad. That's what happened to this friend of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's well again.
C: OTTO
D: What kind of car does your... does your friend drive?
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Chevy Malibu.
C: OTTO
D: And you do the same type of work?
C: J. FRANK PARNELL

C: OTTO
D: This is really a nice old car. Why don't you let me drive?
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: What do you mean?
C: OTTO
D: Well I don't know. I mean...uh! Don't you feel funny.?
C: J. FRANK PARNELL
D: Why should I feel funny? The two hemispheres are fundamentally at odds. Hemisphere, Hemisphere. You know it's strange. I do feel funny...
N: J. Frank Parnell passes out at the wheel and drives into the sign at another railroad crossing. Otto dumps him and drives off with the Malibu. The helping hand crew at Miller's with their wives
