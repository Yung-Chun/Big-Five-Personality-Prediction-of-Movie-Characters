T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
C: LONG SHOT
D: The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the LEGEND:
N: HAWAII, 1941
C: SIX MONTHS BEFORE
D: PEARL HARBOR
N: The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him. He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called "PREW" for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT.
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.
C: MAGGID
D: Fine way to pass the time. Good for the mind.
C: PREW
D: Hello, Maggio.
N: Maggio turns and stares at Prew, astonished.
C: MAGGIO
D: Prew...?
C: PREW
D: I transferred out of Fort Shatter.
E: NODS
N: Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes have been removed. Prew follows his glance.
C: MAGGIO
D: You quit the Bugle Corps...?
N: Prew nods. Maggio jerks his head toward the sign.
C: MAGGIO
D: To here...?
C: PREW
D: That's what the orders say.
E: SHRUGS
C: MAGGIO
D: You made a bad mistake. This outfit they can give back to Custer.
N: Prew smiles slightly, starts toward door.
C: MAGGIO
D: The Captain ain't in yet.
N: Prew puts down his barracks bags.
C: PREY
D: I'll look around.
C: MAGGIO
D: Maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night.
E: smiles for first time
C: PHEW
D: Maybe.
N: TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street. He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances through the screen door, goes in.
S: INT. DAYROOM - DAY
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc. Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
D: The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly. He watches the balls hurry around the table.
C: WARDEN'S VOICE
D: What're you think you're doing!? Why ain't you out in the field with the Compny? What's your name?
E: O. S.
N: The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN, almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful, has a neatly-trimmed moustache.
C: PREW
D: Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter.
C: WARDEN
D: Yeah. I heard about you.
C: PREW
D: I heard about you, too, Warden.
C: WARDEN
D: Well, put up that cue and come along. This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown. The Man's very particlar about little things like that.
N: Warden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and follows him.
S: EXT. COMPANY STREET
C: TRUCKING SHOT
D: as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces ahead. They go into the Orderly Room.
S: INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room. MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.
C: WARDEN
D: Mazzioli! Grant went to the hospital yesterday. Did you make up his sick record? Did you make a note for the morning report?! You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy Sickbook is your job!
C: MAZZIOLI
D: Those medics didn't get the Sickbook back till late yesterday -- I'll tend to it right now --
C: WARDEN
D: Thanks. I already done it for you.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now, stares at the other man as if still incredulous.
C: MAGGIO
D: But you the beat bugler they got over at Shatter. You probly the best on this whole Rock.
N: In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully.
C: PREW
D: That's true.
N: Maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper basket.
C: MAGGIO
D: Well, friend, I feel for you. But from my position I can't quite reach you.
C: WARDEN
D: Ten-sh-HUT!
N: Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention. The screen door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of himself, therefore always too certain with his men. He nods pleasantly.
C: HOLMES
D: At ease. Good morning, men. Anything special this morning, Sergeant Warden? I've only a few minutes.
C: WARDEN
D: New man here, sir.
C: HOLMES
D: Oh, yes. Bring him in.
N: Holmes goes into his office. Warden jerks his thumb toward the door. Prewitt goes into the office. Warden follows him.
S: INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Holmes is seated at his desk as Prewitt and Warden enter. A placard on it reads: CAPTAIN HOLMES. A smaller desk nearby has a placard' reading: 1ST SERGEANT WARDEN. Warden seats himself at this desk. On the walls are framed photographs of prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. On Holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very attractive blonde woman. Prewitt comes to attention in front of Holmes' desk.
C: PREWITT
D: Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt reporting to the Compny Commander as ordered.
C: HOLMES
D: At ease. (takes papers out of drawer, glances through
C: THEM)
D: They sent your service record over... Twenty-two years of age... born in Kentucky... enlisted first at Fort Myer, Virginia... Bugle Corps... re-enlisted for overseas duty... Fort Shafter... First Bugler... Prewitt, I always make it a policy to talk to my new men. It's important for an officer and his men to understand each other. Now I have a fine smooth-running outfit.
E: BENIGNLY
C: ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
D: Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with unholy glee.
C: HOLMES
D: Plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier. But he's got to show me he's got it on the ball. I don't know what you've been used to in the Bugle Corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book. What kind of trouble were you in over there?
C: PREW
D: No trouble, sir.
C: HOLMES
D: What made you transfer out, then?
C: PREW
D: It's a personal matter, air.
C: HOLMES
D: Oh. I see...
N: He studies Prew for a moment, sees Warden on the edge of his chair, watching hawk-like.
C: HOLMES
D: Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
C: WARDEN
D: Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had Corpral's stripes in the Bugle Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to buck Private to transfer to an Infantry Compny. Why? Because you like to hike?
E: EXPLODES SUDDENLY
C: PREW
D: I dint have no trouble if that's what you mean.
C: WARDED
D: Or was it just because you couldn't stand to bugle?
E: GRINS SUDDENLY
C: PREW
D: It was a personal matter.
C: WARDEN
D: That's up to the Compny Commander's discretion to decide.
C: PREW
D: All right. I was First Bugler at Shafter for two years. The topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states. Next day he made him First Bugler over me.
E: looks straight at Warden
C: WARDEN
D: And you asked out on account of that!?
C: PREY
D: Maybe I just ain't sensible... But that's the reason.
C: WARDEN
D: His feelings were hurt! Kids they send us now!
E: SNORTS
N: Warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at his desk as if the Prew situation is too absurd to concern himself with. Holmes speaks blandly, winningly.
C: HOLMES
D: I've got a mighty sour Company Bugler here... but I suppose you wouldn't want that job.
C: PREY
D: No, air.
C: HOLMES
D: Well, we'll get your stripes back for you, maybe an extra one for good measure. You know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer?
E: SMILES
C: PREW
D: No, sir.
C: HOLDS
D: I pulled a few strings. I'm the Regimental Boxing Coach, Prewitt. I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl year before last. With any luck you should have won it. I thought for a while, in the second round, you were going to knock him out.
C: PREW
D: Thank you, sir.
E: TENSE
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT HOLMES
C: HOLMES
D: My Regiment got beaten last year in the finals, as you know. But I mean to win this year. And I will. All I've needed was a top middleweight. Next year I'll hang your picture up there with the others, my boy.
E: BITTERLY SAVAGE INSISTENCE waves at pictures
N: MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW
C: PREW
D: I'm sorry, air. But I quit fighting.
C: HOLMES.
D: Quit fighting? When? What for?
C: PREW
D: I just stopped, sir... After -- Maybe you heard about what happened...
C: HOLMEB
D: You mean that fallow you hurt -- the one that went blind?
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: Prew's lips are drawn tight. He nods almost imperceptibly.
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: During this shot Maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to Orderly Room. He pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and then to listen.
C: HOLMES
D: Yes, it's too bad about that. I can understand how you feel. But those things happen in this game. A man has got to accept that possibility when he fights.
C: PREW
D: That's why I decided I would quit, sir.
C: HOLMES
D: But on the other hand, look at
E: LESS WARMLY MORE
C: HOLMES
D: it this way. What if all fighters felt like that?
E: CONT'D
C: PREW
D: They don't.
C: HOLMES
D: Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt?
C: PREW
D: No, sir. I dint say --
C: HOLMES
D: You might as well say stop war because one man got killed. Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home.
C: PREW
D: I don't want it disbanded, sir. But I don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to.
E: DOGGEDLY
C: HOLMES
D: It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is.
N: Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to attention.
C: HOLMES
D: Maybe you'll change your mind. In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit. I've got to go into town. Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant?
E: TO WARDEN
C: WARDEN
D: Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's got to be made out. It's due TOMORROW --
E: holds up papers
C: HOLMES
D: You make it out. Is that all?
C: WARDEN
D: No, sir!
E: holds up more papers
C: HOLMES
D: Well, whatever it is, you fix it. If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. I won't be back.
N: He goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor. In a moment, the sound of the screen door slamming is heard. Warden picks up the papers.
C: WARDEN
D: He'd strangle on his own spit if I weren't here to swab out his throat for him. Come on. I'll show you the Supply Room.
E: TO PREW
N: Warden goes out to Orderly Room, Prew following.
S: INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: as Prew and Warden enter and walk through. Maggio bobs his head approvingly at Prew.
S: EXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND PREW as they come out of the Orderly Room. Prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders, balancing them delicately. CAMERA TRUCKS with him and Warden as they walk down the porch.
C: WARDEN
D: (one of his unexpected
C: INTENSE BURSTS)
D: Know what you did just now?
E: MORE
C: WARDEN
D: When you turned down Dynanite Holmes' boxing squad? You put your head in a noose. Things are soft for a boxer in his Compny. Otherwise, you better know how to soljer.
E: CONT'D
C: PHEW
D: I can soljer with any man.
C: WARDEN
D: This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this is straight duty.
C: PREW
D: I'll take my chances.
N: A convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the Orderly Room. KAREN HOLMES, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets out. Her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the Orderly Room. Warden and Prew stop walking and watch her. Karen stops, glances at Warden momentarily, then goes into the Orderly Room.
C: WARDEN
D: Since when is this place gettin to be the Royal Hawaiian?
C: PREW
D: Who's she?
C: WARDEN
D: His wife. Captain Holmes'.
N: They resume walking.
C: WARDEN
D: You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight because Captain Holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make Mayor. And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. I only been in this outfit eight months myself but I learned one thing. My job is to keep him happy. The more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better I run his Compny. So we know where we stand, don't we, kid?
C: PREW
D: I know where I stand. I don't believe that's the only way a man can get along.
E: MORE
C: PREW
D: A man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. It he don't, he's nothin...
E: CONT'D
C: WARDEN
D: Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. But not in our time, kid. Today you got to play ball. You got to divide it all by two.
N: They have reached a Dutch door, top half open. A sign over it reads: SUPPLY ROOM. MEDIUM SHOT SHOOTING INTO SUPPLY ROOM SUPPLY SERGEANT LEVA is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other. He is a foolish- looking man, about thirty-five.
C: WARDEN
D: Lava! Can't I once walk by this Supply Room and find you workin with both hands!
C: LEVA
D: I can't do no better on what you people pay me.
E: comes up to door
C: WARDEN
D: Draw some supplies for this man. That's G Compny barracks over there. Get rid of your bags and come back here, and Leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in. Save you makin four five trips.
E: TO PREW
C: PREW
D: Okay.
E: surprised, pleased
C: WARDEN
D: I just hate to see energy wasted. Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin yours.
N: Prew walks off, toting the barracks bags. The bang of the Orderly Room door is heard and Lava and Warden look in that direction. LONG SHOT KAREN HOLMES FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S ANGLE as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a sweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN AND LEVA watching Karen. Leva leans over the counter.
C: LEVA
D: Her and them sweaters.
N: LONG SHOT KAREN FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S POV as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering.
C: WARDEN'S VOICE
D: Army women... They're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond. There's no pleasure in them...
C: LEVA'S VOICE
D: Yeah, but this one knows the score... Like I been tellin you.
C: WARDEN'S VOICE
D: Is that right?
E: SARCASTIC
C: LEVA'S VOICE
D: Okay, not around here. But I was back at Fort Bliss with Holmes. When they was married only a year or two. I heard plenty about the lady then. Plenty.
C: WARDEN'S VOICE
D: You heard.
C: LEVA'S VOICE
D: Okay, never me. But a lot of them. I know some of the Use she played 'around with, don't tell me.
C: WARDEN'S VOICE
D: I ain't tellin you. You're tellin me.
N: Karen stops, a few paces from camera.
C: KAREN
D: Good morning, Sergeant.
N: MEDIUM SHOT Lava watches, listens avidly but discreetly in b.g. During the dialogue, Karen seems irritated by Warden, who looks at her coolly, appraisingly, physically.
C: KAREN
D: I'm looking for my husband.
C: WARDEN
D: Captain Holmes just went in town, ma'am.
C: KAREN
D: Oh. Of course, He was to have left some things for me. That he was to have purchased. Do you know anything about them?
E: STUMBLES SLIGHTLY
C: WARDEN
D: No, ma'am, I don't. Is there anythin I can do for you?
C: KAREN.
D: No, thanks, Sergeant.
N: She makes slight move to go, pauses.
C: KAREN
D: He's been telling me quite a bit about you lately. My husband. He says you're very efficient.
C: WARDEN
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: KAREN
D: What is it that makes you so efficient, Sergeant?
C: WARDEN
D: I couldn't help it if I was born smart, ma'am.
N: Karen laughs suddenly, loudly.
C: KAREN
D: I love that. Well, good-bye, Sergeant.
N: Karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car. Warden and Leva watch her. When she is out of earshot Leva speaks.
C: LEVA
D: But man, she sure is one, ain't she?
C: WARDEN
D: One what?
C: LEVA
D: One woman.
C: WARDEN
D: I've seen better.
E: UNCONVINCINGLY
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT 22 Karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing table, brushing her hair -- steadily, gracefully, enjoying the sensual pleasure of it. Karen is a woman of moods and tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. A car is heard pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. Karen's brush strokes become faster, rougher. The front door is heard opening and Holmes' voice calling, "Karen." She does not answer. Holmes enters. He seems to have had a few drinks. Through the following, Karen continues brushing her hair.
C: HOLMES
D: I'm sorry I'm so late. And about dinner, I --
C: KAREN
D: It doesn't matter.
C: HOLMES
D: -- I got tied up with General Slater. Bumped into him at the Officers' Club.
C: KAREN
D: Yes? What did the General have to say?
C: HOLMES
D: Success, he said. Success in war, success in peacetime... And not a word about my promotion... There are times I think the Old Man's just waiting to ship me down... I've had a bad day all around...
E: slumps into chair MORE
C: HOLMES
D: started right off this morning... trouble with a new man...
E: CONT'D
C: KAREN
D: If you'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with your Company, maybe you'd get that promotion.
C: HOLDS
D: The Company takes care of itself. Or my Topkick takes care of it.
C: KAREN
D: I went over there this morning looking for you.
C: HOLMES
D: I had some business to attend to in town. During the afternoon.
E: FLUSTERED
C: KAREN
D: From the way you look I gather your business wasn't too successful.
E: UNEMOTIONALLY
C: HOLMES
D: Now what does that mean?
C: KAREN
D: Dana. Give me credit for a few brains.
C: HOLMES
D: How many, times do I have to tell you I haven't any other women before you'll believe me?
N: CLOSE SHOT KAREN SHOOTING INTO MIRROR ON DRESSING TABLE Karen laughs sharply, loudly, then stops suddenly as she looks at herself in the mirror, sees the repugnance in her face. She puts down the hairbrush, picks up a long comb.
C: HOLMES VOICE
D: If it were so, don't you think I'd admit it? The way things are between us now? What right have you to always be accusing me?
C: KAREN
D: What right?
N: TWO SHOT They are both tense now. Holmes is out of the chair and pacing. Karen combs her hair spasmodically.
C: HOLMES
D: That again. How long will it be, I wonder, before I'm allowed to live that down? After eight years, how many times do I have to tell you It Was An Accident?
C: KAREN
D: That makes it all right, I suppose!
C: HOLMES
D: I didn't say that. I know what it's done to you, but --
C: KAREN
D: You know I hate to talk about it!
N: He moves over to her.
C: HOLM ES
D: How many times do I have to tell you I'm sorry, about that? How many times that I had no way of knowing -
N: He puts his hands on her shoulders. Karen shakes away, rises, faces him.
C: KAREN
D: You had a way of knowing, Dana. I want to go to bed. Please get out of my bedroom.
N: Holmes looks at her sullenly, then exits to adjoining room, closing the door behind him. There is a moment of silence, then a sharp snap as Karen breaks the comb in two.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. DAYROOM - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN
D: The room is fairly well filled with soldiers. The click of pool balls is heard over shot. Warden is reading a newspaper.. A column heading, conspicuous in shot, reads: JAPS ADVANCE IN CHINA. Warden drops the paper on his lap, looks toward pool table, squinting thoughtfully.
N: FULL SHOT AT POOL TABLE Maggio, Prew and CHIEF CHOATE, a Corporal, are playing pool. Choate is a full Choctaw Indian, a man of great bulk and tolerance. He speaks in a tremendously deep bass voice. The table on one side is surrounded by the prizefighters of G Company. They are IRE GALOVITCH, an ape-like, bent-kneed man weighing about two twenty, with a widow's peak almost to his eyebrows; BALDY DHOM, chunky and tough, his head as bald as an orange; TURP THORNHILL, a stringy, chinless Mississipian; HENDERSON, a tall, hard Texan; CHAMP WILSON, wiry and good- looking. They are all Sergeants except Wilson, who is a Corporal. The men have been heckling Prew and are watching with cold belligerence. Choate, bending over his cue, shoots and misses.
C: CHOATE
D: I'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight.
N: Prew shoots, makes a brilliant shot.
C: MAGGIO
D: Man, what I would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my home town: I'd dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth, and I would make a whole mint of ghelt off him!
N: Choate laughs deeply. Prew sizes up a new shot.
C: WILSON
D: We'd of won last year if we had a good middleweight. You box as good as you used to over at Shatter we're a cinch this year.
N: Prew doesn't respond. He bends over his cue again.
C: THORNHILL
D: You ain't forget the Division champs get ten day furloughs, did you, son? Ey?
C: GALOVITCH
D: You no talk now, Prewitt. But out in field with us you sing different song. An don't think you are tough guy. Quickest way to stockade is
C: BEING TOUGH
D: guy.
C: HENDERSON
D: You heard him. Better think it over.
C: MAGGIO
D: Lissen, it's his right not to fight if he don't want. Without bein kicked around. Now, we playin pool. Whyn't you take off?
C: DHOM
D: You want a busted head, Maggio?
C: MAGGIO
D: No.
E: SERIOUSLY
C: DHOM
D: Then keep your big nose out altogether. Trainin season starts next week --
E: turns back to Prew
N: Prew has been growing more and more agitated, as much by an inner turmoil as by the men. His control snaps suddenly.
C: PREW
D: I told you I quit fightin! I'm through! An that's all she wrote: You guys want to put the screws on, go ahead. I can take anything you hand out!
C: DHOM
D: Okay, Prewitt. No halts barred.
N: The five men move off, file out of the Dayroom.
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: His paper still on his lap. He has been watching. He wears a faint smile of respect.
N: MEDIUM SHOT PHEW, MAGGIO, CHOATE Prew chalks his cue, hands trembling, turns to Maggio.
C: PREW
D: Thanks.
C: MAGGIO
D: I just hate to see a good man get it in the gut.
C: CHOATE
D: You might as well get use to it, kid. You probly be seein it often before you die.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND CHOATE In b.g. a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine but most of them are in their bunks. Over shot the sound of a bugle blowing Tattoo is heard. Lights are being extinguished in various parts of the room. Prew and Choate are lying on adjoining bunks, smoking. Choate's voice is almost linked to his last speech of preceding scene.
C: CHO ATE
D: ... oh, sure, we got a few bad non- coms and we got Dynamite Holmes for a Captain. But I been around twenty years in this Army. They even up.
N: In b. g. Warden and SERGEANT PETE (POP) KARELSEN come through from the latrine. The latter is a grizzled, crumbled dog- face, about fifty.
C: CHOATE
D: Take A Compny. They got the best Compny Commander I ever saw. But their Topkick -- he ain't no Warden.
N: Warden stops beside Prew and Karelsen moves on, going in to a small room off the main squadroom. Warden's big, powerful body is covered only by a towel around his loins. He smiles at Prew.
C: WARDEN
D: Hello, kid. Everythin nice and comfy?
C: PREW
D: Never better.
C: WARDEN
D: 'at's the lull before the storm, kid. Set yourself.
N: He moves off, goes into the room he shares with Karelsen.
C: PREW
D: What's the deal with him, anyway? I can't figure him.
N: The lights are almost all off and activity in the room has ended.
C: CHOATE
D: The Warden? He's a wild man. He was in the 15th when they seen their action in the Settlement in Shanghai. I heard about it down in the Philippes even. He got himself a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it but you'd never know it if I dint tell you. This next war comes, Warden'll be right in there, standin up on the skyline, trio to get himself killed, but nothing will ever touch him. He'll come through maddern, wildern, craziern ever. All I know is he's the best soljer I ever saw...
N: The lights are all out now and the room is in darkness.
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN:
S: EXT. ROAD - DAY
N: TRUCKING SHOT PLATOON OF MEN carrying rifles, marching at attention. Prew is FEATURED in shot; a light smile of pleasure as he moves along. Choate, bringing up the rear, is singing the Regimental Marching Song in a wonderful basso. Dhom marches on one side of the platoon, Galovitch on the other. Dhom calls out the "huts." CLOSE SHOT FEET OF MEN MARCHING They are in perfect unison. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT PREW
C: DHOM'S VOICE
D: Prewitt! Get in step, Prewitt!
N: Prew frowns slightly. He hops once, changing stride, realizes he is now out of step.

C: MEDIUM SHOT THE PLATOON
D: kneeling over their rifles, laid out on shelter halves. Prew is FEATURED in shot. His shirt is wet and he is sweating heavily, as if he has just come from the run around the track. Henderson stands in front of the group, instructing.
C: HENDERSON
D: -- rifle's your beat friend. In case them weapons jams in combat could mean life or death. You got to know 'em inside out. Now I want you to strip them weapons and put it together again. Go!
E: holds up stop watch
N: The men start taking their rifles apart as fast as they can. Henderson walks around watching them. MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND MAGGIO stripping rifles. Prew is efficient and brilliantly fast, Maggio fumbling and slow. Maggio keeps looking over at Prew, admiring his speed.
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: as he strips the rifle. Prew finishes the job and CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE on shelter half where all the parts are laid out.
E: This mechanical operation should be interesting to audiences; a good man can field strip the weapon in thirty or forty seconds.
C: HENDERSON'S VOICE
D: 'at's fair time. Now lemma see you put it together.
N: Prew's hands start to work over rifle parts, putting them together.

C: CLOSE SHOT HENDERSON
D: looking along barrel. SHOT FEATURES his thumb as he flips the rear sight to one side. Henderson turns around and ANGLE WIDENS to include Prew. He throws the rifle at Prew, who catches it, staggering back.
C: HENDERSON
D: Your rear sight's way off! You'd be fifty feet off your target at three hundred yards! That's what comes when a soljer don't know how to assemble a rifle. You better get down to the track and carry it around a few times. Maybe that'll teach you...

C: GROUP SHOT BAYONET PRACTICE
D: The platoon is divided into teams of two. Thornhill is the instructor. This is actual hand-to-hand training. Prew wields his rifle, bayonet fixed, in expert thrusts. Maggio is fighting in next lane. Thornhill walks behind Prew, trips him quickly as he passes. Prew falls off balance. His opponent smashes his rifle against Prew's, knocks it to the ground. Prew whirls on Thornhill in protest.
C: THORNHILL
D: Wide open, ey, Prewitt? Maybe seven laps'll teach you to watch yourself...
N: Maggio, wielding his rifle madly, yells over.

D: I use to think a shipping clerk was a dog's life. What I would not give to be back in Gimbel's basement!
E: sighs, shakes head
N: As they come up to the Supply Room, Warden, neat and cool, is leaning on the counter. He steps aside to let them pass, beams at Prew.
C: WARDEN
D: Chow's almost over, men. Better hurry up and wash. `less of course you'd rather go in the way you are.
N: Maggio gives Warden a dirty look. Prew's expression is noncommittal. They carry their rifles into the Supply Room. Leva comes up to the door as Warden turns to go back to the Orderly Room. As he does, Karen's convertible comes down the street. Warden stops, watches it. LONG SHOT FROM WARDEN'S POV as Karen drives by, turning her head slightly toward Warden. There is the vaguest trace of i smile. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN as he turns to watch the departing car.
C: LEVA
D: I'm tellin you, Top, she's trouble. You better keep your mind off what you're thinkin.

S: INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES It is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the office. Warden is at his desk, working. Holmes is buckling on his trench coat. He wears a happy smile.
C: HOLMES
D: I won't be back in time to take Retreat. Or Reveille either, probably.
E: winks at Warden
C: WARDEN
D: Yes, sir.
C: HOLMES
D: (strides back and forth;
C: JOVIALLY)
D: All work and no play, Sergeant. All you do is sit around sweating over this paper and that. There are other things in this world beside work.
N: Warden carries some official papers to Holmes' desk.
C: HOLMES
D: (bending over, tying
C: SHOELACE)
E: MORE
C: HOLMES
D: You ought to get out more yourself, Warden.
E: CONT'D
N: Warden is looking directly at the picture of Karen on Holmes' desk.
C: WARDEN
D: I've been considering it.
N: He turns aside as Holmes straightens up.
C: HOLMES
D: Well, I'm going.
N: He claps Warden on the back fraternally.
C: HOLMES
D: I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.
C: WARDEN
D: It'll be here when you get back.
N: Holmes goes out. Warden turns back to Holmes' desk. He is still holding the papers in one hand. He looks at Karen's picture, picks it up with his other hand, squints at it, considering the chances very, very carefully.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BACK PORCH OF HOLMES' HOUSE - DAY
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: standing on the open porch, in the rain. He wears a GI raincoat. He is squinting at the door with the same expression he used looking at Karen's picture. He takes a deep breath as if he were going off a high diving board, then knocks briskly. A shadow moves across the room behind the curtains. Then Karen opens the door. She is in shorts and a blouse.
C: KAREN
D: Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet.
N: Warden opens the screen door and jumps in past the water running off the eaves.
S: INT. SMALL PANTRY OFF KITCHEN - DAY
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: as Warden jumps in. He takes off his rain hat.
C: WARDEN
D: I am wet.
C: KAREN
D: If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here.
C: WARDEN
D: And if I'm not looking for him?
E: taking the long chance
C: KAREN
D: He still isn't here. If that does you any good.
E: UNSMILING
C: WARDEN
D: Well, I'm looking for him. Do you know where he is?
E: QUICKLY
C: KAREN
D: I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town. I guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the Club. Having a drink.
C: WARDEN
D: I got some papers it's important for him to sign. Today.
E: fishes in his pocket, brings out papers
C: KAREN
D: I'll try phoning him at the Club for you.
E: TURNS
C: WARDEN
D: I never like to disturb a man drinking.
C: KAREN
D: What is it you want, Sergeant?
E: TURNS BACK
C: WARDEN
D: I could use a drink myself right now. Bad. Anyway, I got a faint suspicion the Captain's `in town.' Ain't you going to ask me in?
N: Karen finally smiles, faintly. She goes into the kitchen, leaving the door open. Warden follows her.
S: INT. KITCHEN HOLMES HOUSE - DAY
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink, puts it on the sink. Warden puts the papers down and drinks. Karen sits on a high kitchen stool.
C: KAREN
D: You're taking an awful chance, you know. My maid is liable to be home any time.
C: WARDEN
D: No she won't. Thursday's her day off.
N: He takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair.
C: KAREN
D: You think of everything, don't you, Sergeant?
C: WARDEN
D: I try. In my position you have to.
C: KAREN
D: (goes to sink, picks up
C: THE PAPERS)
D: Are these really important?
C: WARDEN
D: Yes. But not important they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.
N: Karen suddenly, deliberately, rips the papers in half. Then she tears them into bits and throws them into the wastebasket. Warden appreciates the gesture, relaxes for the first time. He grins widely.
C: WARDEN
D: I got carbons of those back at the office. So it won't be much work to fix them up.
N: Warden's control has begun to affect Karen's now. She is losing her poise.
C: KAREN
D: That's what I like about you, Sergeant. You have confidence. It's also what I dislike about you.
C: WARDEN
D: It's not confidence. It's honesty.
C: KAREN
D: Honesty? How did you acquire such an old-fashioned virtue?
C: WARDEN
D: I figgered out one day it was the shortest distance between two points.
C: KAREN
D: Well, he's clever as well as virile.
C: WARDEN
D: No -- it's just that I hate to see a beautiful woman goin all to waste.
N: He moves close to Karen, is on the verge of embracing her. Greatly tempted but greatly disturbed, she turns away. During next she pours herself a drink, the bottle shaking in her hand. Her tone is no longer brittle. It is bitter.
C: KAREN
D: Waste, did you say? Now that's a subject I might tell you something about. There's we. And then there's waste. Positive and negative. The negative is sometimes more interesting... more evil. For example -- what about the house without a child? Tell me your thoughts, Sergeant.
C: WARDEN
D: You're going to cry.
C: KAREN
D: Not if I can help it.
C: WARDEN
D: Please don't cry... I can't stand to see somebody cry.
N: Karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat, is about to put it on.
C: KAREN
D: What are you doing?
C: WARDEN
D: I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?
C: KAREN
D: I don't know, Sergeant. To be honest, I don't know.
E: SLOWLY
N: They stare squarely at each other, both puzzled and a little afraid of their emotions. This is something neither had counted on.
C: WARDEN
D: I know a beach near Diamond Head. Nobody ever goes there. The cars on the highway pass above and they never know it's there. You feel like you used to feel when you were a kid, hiding by yourself in a cave, watching the others hunting you.
N: Karen turns, goes to the sink, puts the whisky bottle back in the cabinet.
C: KAREN
D: Maybe... why not?
C: WARDEN
D: How about Payday?
N: Karen is trying hard to regain her glassy composure. She is unsmiling again.
C: KAREN
D: You don't have to spend money on me, Sergeant.
C: WARDEN
D: I just like to have some on me when I take out a woman. Can you get away?
C: KAREN
D: Maybe.
N: Warden grins as he puts on his raincoat. He goes to the door to the pantry, pauses there.
C: WARDEN
D: I'll be in Kuhio Park. Say, nine o'clock. Payday.
N: Karen leans back against the sink, watches him go out to the pantry. A moment later the sound of the door is heard as he leaves the house. She turns on the faucet, starts to rinse, the glasses they have used. Suddenly she turns the faucet on full force, watches it pound into the sink.
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN:
S: EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT HOLMES GALOVITCH THORNHILL WILSON DHOM HENDERSON The men are grouped around Holmes. He is pressing hard to pretend equanimity. The Sergeants appear somewhat baffled but determined.
C: HOLMES
D: -- this man Prewitt's been here over a month now. I expected you mend have him around before this.
C: HENDERSON
D: We've been runnin him pretty hard. But he don't faze.
C: HOLMES
D: Maybe he needs a good dose of The Treatment.
N: The men react to the phrase; The Treatment is obviously reserved for very special, intractable cases. They consider it silently for a moment or two.
C: GALOVITCH
D: A double dose needs him to be given.
C: THORNHILL
D: The Treatment'll bring that puppy boy around...
E: NODS
C: HOLMES
D: You understand. I don't want any rough stuff.

E: CONT'D
N: The music of the forthcoming MONTAGE drowns Holmes' words as he continues.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: EFFECT MONTAGE
D: The MONTAGE consists of a continuous stream of SUPERIMPOSURES depicting Prew's growing humiliation and exhaustion at the hands of the non-corns. Mingling with the background shots are VARIOUS ANGLES of CLOSEUPS of Prew. As the speed of the sequence increases, the stubborn smile on his face gives way to hurt, bitterness, anger... Over shots we occasionally hear stray shouts of the non-corns as they belabor Prew, but for the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by MUSIC. The MONTAGE can be selected and created from the FOLLOWING:
N: FLASHES ADDITIONAL ANGLES OF PRECEDING TRAINING SEQUENCES FLASHES ADDITIONAL TRAINING SITUATIONS -- E.G. FIRING RANGE, PATROL EXERCISES, GRENADE PRACTICE (IF NEEDED) in all of which Prew excels. FLASHES GALOVITCH WILSON DHOM THORNHILL HENDERSON riding Prew, mocking him, grinning at him, thumbing him to the track, etc. FEATURED is Galovitch, who takes particular Joy in baiting Prew.
C: FLASHES PREW
D: running around track, staggering despite a tremendous effort not to show his fatigue.
C: OBSTACLE COURSE
D: with the platoon going through, crouched low, live ammunition spattering around them. Prew, nearest camera, is lower than any man in the line. Over shot we hear a snatch of Wilson's Voice yelling at Prew to get lower.
N: CLOSE FLASH WILSON AND PREW Wilson bawling Prew out, thumbing him to one side of obstacle course.
C: FLASHES PREW
D: chinning himself on bar setup near obstacle course; he is near physical exhaustion.
C: OBSTACLE COURSE PREW
D: going through alone, on his belly in deep mud.
N: CLOSEUP PREW (CULMINATION OF SUPERIMPOSED CLOSEUPS AND END OF MONTAGE) coming HEAD-ON into camera as he bellies through the mud of the obstacle course. Snatch of mingled voices of non-coms yelling "Keep it downs", "Get that nose in the mud!", etc. Prew is utterly spent. His face drops into the mud, which splatters up, obscuring the screen.

S: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT SWIRLING DISHWATER IN SINK
C: MEDIUM SHOT PREW
D: bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking pans and mixing basins. He hangs the soap bucket on the hot faucet and turns it on full force. As he does, PRIVATE WILLARD, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile of pans before him. Prew looks at them ruefully. Willard says something to him with a "hustle up" gesture. The faucet drowns the words.
N: MEDIUM SHOT ANOTHER PART OF KITCHEN PREW AT SINK IN B.G. Men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the KP. Waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess halls, carrying large trays. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT STARK The Mesa Sergeant, a tall, gaunt man, surveys the scene possessively. Maggio, Dining Room Orderly today, wearing a soiled white coat, flashes by to the mess hall, almost dropping his loaded tray in his haste.
C: MEDIUM SHOT PRIVATE TREADWELL
D: A slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes. There is a large kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the potatoes are floating. Treadwell stabs at one with a long fork, misses it. He stabs again, almost in slow motion, misses again. He sees Stark glowering over him.
C: TREADWELL
D: Ah+m suppose to be a automatic rifle man, not a spud-cutter.
C: STARK
D: Rifle man, huh? All somebody'd have to do would be holler war at you and it'd be over the hill and far away.
E: DISGUSTEDLY
N: Stark walks off.
C: TREADWELL
D: ... they just give me my chance they'll see...
N: He is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time. He raises it triumphantly like a caught fish. MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND WILLARD The faucet is still on and we cannot hear what Willard says as he dumps more pans before Prew. However, he is obviously complaining that Prew is slow. Prew, sweating and angry, barks something back at him and turns the faucet off.
C: PREW
D: No cook ever used that many panel Not even for an officers, banquet, ladies invited! Want me to grow couple more arms?!
N: Stark, always alert to trouble, comes into shot. Willard sees him and speaks with whining dignity, for Stark's benefit.
C: WILLARD
D: All I ask is that you keep the pans washed up so they're clean when I need them. In order that I am allowed to cook the kind of food required for men who work hard all day and who need good nourishing food to get their nourishment.
C: STARK
D: Hole up 'at noise. This man's hot as a forty-five shootin downhill.
C: WILLARD
D: How you think I can do my job if the Mess Sergeant takes sides with a goldbricking KP? What do you think I am?
E: TERRIBLY INJURED
C: STARK
D: I think you're a fat cook who can't cook.
N: As Willard retires, Maggio pours through from the mass hall. Screaming joyously, he shoves two empty platters in front of him.
C: MAGGIO
D: Comin through! Comin through! Me and my table waiters!
E: MORE
C: MAGGIO
D: We workin our tail off. They runnin us to death. Hot stuff! Comin through hot stuff one side!
E: CONT'D
N: Nobody pays any attention but Prew, who smiles at him. Maggio winks back.
C: MAGGIO
D: Hello, Prew! Bettern being threwn in jail, ain't it?
N: Maggio passes camera, leaving the shot and disclosing Warden, who has entered from the mess hall in his wake. He carries a dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry table. He is grinning lovingly toward Prew. He strolls over to Prew. He eats through following. The smile never leaves his face, broadens as the scene progresses.
C: WARDEN
D: You look awful tard, kid.
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: working over the sink.
C: WARDEN'S VOICE
D: How do you like straight duty?. Life in a rifle compny, eh?

N: MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING KP'S, STARK, MAGGIO, WILLARD, TREADWELL as something electric transmits itself and they all stop what they are doing to look over toward Prew and Warden.
C: WARDEN
D: I didn't say you minded it, kid. I just said you looked tard. Drawn to a fine edge.
C: PREW
D: I don't mind it, Top. It's a great life, this. I find a pearl, I'll cut you in. Fifty-fifty, If you hadn't put me here, I wouldn't have had no chance to find it.

D: You got a better memory than me. Guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while, huh?
E: NODS
N: He pretends to turn away, then stops, turns back.
C: WARDEN
D: Course if you was an ath-a-leet you wouldn't have to pull KP. Or any fatigue duty for that matter...
C: PREW
D: If you think you can push me into fightin, Warden, you're wrong. Not you and Dynamite and The Treatment. I'm twice the man you are. If you dint have them stripes I'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp.
E: not smiling now
C: WARDEN
D: Don't let the stripes worry you, kid. I can always take my shirt off. Take it off right now.
E: smile growing bigger
C: PREW
D: You'd like that. You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one, couldn't you?
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW'S HAND
D: closing around a heavy mug in the sink.
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW AND WARDEN Warden looking at Prew's hand. Warden's grin broadens with something more than sarcasm. He is 'impressed and pleased by Prew's honest anger.
C: WARDEN
D: Don't throw it, Prewitt. It might break on my head. And that would cost you one thin dime next Payday.
N: Warden deliberately turns his back and walks off. Prew looks after him. CAMERA MOVES IN to FEATURE his hand on the mug. He grasps it tighter, then lets it fall back into the soapy water,

N: CLOSE SHOT PRIVATE FRIDAY CLARK He is blowing the bugle, sounding Pay Call. The rays of a blinding sun flash on its shiny surface.
S: INT. MESS HALL - DAY
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: The bugle is heard over shot. A line of spruced-up men stretches through the mess hall. A blanket is spread over a table and behind it sits Holmes, flanked by Warden and Mazzioli. In front of Holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a cigar box filled with silver. He is paying out the man at the head of the line.
C: HOLMES
D: -- and just see you don't drink all this up in one place.
N: The man smiles, appreciating the whimsy, salutes, moves off.
C: WARDEN
D: Prewitt.
N: Prew, next in line, steps up to the table.
C: PREW
D: Robert E. Lee, RA 345071.
N: He is crisp, sharp, expressionless. He holds out his hands for fingernail inspection. Holmes looks them over, then up at the perfect knot in his tie. He stares at Prew as if trying to fathom him.
C: HOLMES
D: Have you given any thought to the boxing team recently, Prewitt?
C: PREW
D: I feel the same way, sir.
E: TONELESSLY
N: Holmes' hands clench. He seems about to fly into a rage when he senses a motion at his side. He turns to see Warden looking straight at him. Warden's face has the same meaningfully expressionless look as Prew's. Holmes wilts before it, turns to Mazzioli.
C: HOLMES
D: What's this man's pay?
C: MAZZIOLI

S: EXT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT AT ENTRANCE
D: Maggio and Prew, dressed in slacks and Aloha shirts, stand in front of what looks like a renovated residence. They give evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial drinking. The sound of loud piano playing is heard from within. A sign over the door reads: NEW CONGRESS CLUB - SOFT DRINKS - DANCING - RECREATION - MEMBERS ONLY. The door opens
N: and MRS. KIPFER stands at the threshold. She is a sophisticated-looking woman with upswept hair, wears an evening gown with a corsage of orchids. The piano music, louder with the opening of the door, continues through all of the following. The pianist is hammering out "I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire" (or a similar hit of 1941).
C: MAGGIO
D: Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.
C: MRS. KIPPER
D: Why, it's Angelo Maggio.
E: CORDIALLY
N: He barges past her through the door. Mrs. Kipfer frowns and follows him. Prew shrugs and goes in after her.
S: INT. VESTIBULE NEW CONGRESS CLUB - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: as Prew enters behind Mrs. Kipfer. The vestibule has an old South feeling of mustiness and respectability. Maggio is handing some bills to ANNETTE, a young, brash-looking girl, who sits behind a reception desk.
C: MAGGIO
D: Okay... so there y'are. Dues all paid up. Who ya got playin the piana -- a hippo?
C: MRS. KIPPER
D: Angelo, I don't believe I've met your friend. And you know how I hate to find you boys in this condition...
C: MAGGIO
D: There. You see. Any time women see a soldier, think he's drunk. Why? You know why?
C: PREW
D: Because he is.
C: MRS. KIPPER
D: Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix with the entertainment business. Every respectable place must consider its future.
C: PREW
D: Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, I give you my solemn word your future will be safe with us.
N: Maggio nods vigorously in agreement, then pushes through the heavy curtains which separate the vestibule from the room beyond. Mrs. Kipfer looks after him a little unhappily.
C: MRS. KIPPER
D: Angelo is one of my favorites. Annette, dear, take care of this gentleman, will you, please?
N: Mrs. Kipfer exits through the curtains. Annette takes a card from file, picks up pen.
C: ANNETTE
D: It'll be eight bucks, Babyface. Four for initiation fee, four for April dues.
C: PREW
D: Say, what do I get for it?
C: ANNETTE
D: Members are entitled to all privileges of the club which includes dancing, snack bar, soft drink bar, and gentlemanly relaxation with the opposite gender so long as they are gentlemen and no hard liquor is permitted. Got it?
E: rattling it off takes a breath
N: Prew grins, digs in his pocket for money.
C: PREW
D: I got it.
S: INT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - LARGE CLUB ROOM - NIGHT
C: FULL SHOT
D: Several rooms branch off from this main one. There are about a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes -- and about a dozen hostesses. Several couples are dancing. The man at the piano is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a jukebox record from an adjoining room. CAMERA PANS as Mrs. Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy themselves. The New Congress is a sort of primitive U.S.O., a place of well-worn merriment. It is not a house of prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all but one we see at the end of the PAN. She sits alone on a couch. This is LORENE. There is an innocent, child-like look about her. Her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low on her neck. She is about twenty-four. She is reading a
N: magazine, untouched by the din around her. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT "FATSO" JUDSON pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out. He has an enormous head and a hogshead chest. He resembles Porky Pig. His dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced far apart on a great white plate. MEDIUM SHOT NEAR CURTAINS TO VESTIBULE Maggio is attempting some serious dancing with SANDRA, a very tall girl. Fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the langorous tango coming from the jukebox. Maggio keeps switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of the piano but cannot. He is very annoyed. He and Sandra dance out of shot, as Prew and Annette enter from the vestibule. CAMERA PANS them to a trio of girls on a couch.
C: ANNETTE
D: ... Girls, here's some new poison. This is Billy and Jean and Nancy.
N: The girls smile, ad-lib hellos. Prew is looking over the girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot. MEDIUM SHOT LORENE FROM PREW'S POV As if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from the magazine, smiles serenely across the room. MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW AND ANNETTE as she reacts sourly to Prew's reaction to Lorene. He seems transfixed.
C: ANNETTE
D: Don't tell me the Princess is your style.
N: Annette takes his arm, moves him toward two quite good- looking girls talking to a soldier.
C: ANNETTE
D: Meet Suzanne and Roxanne.
N: The girls greet him heartily but Prew is looking back over his shoulder at Lorene. Annette plucks his sleeve with haughty disdain.
C: ANNETTE
D: Much as I adore your company, you must allow me to tear myself away. I see a few friends at the door. Also I can see I will be of no use to you much.
E: SNAPS
N: She walks off. The other girls resume talking to the soldier. Prew continues to gaze across the room.
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LORENE
D: smiling back. Her head tilts up slowly as if someone is coming toward her. Prew comes into shot and stands before her, tongue-tied. She pats the couch. Her voice is low- pitched, poised.
C: LORENE
D: Would you like to sit down?
C: PREW
D: Oh... sure.
E: SITTING
C: LORENE
D: I'm Lorene.
C: PREW
D: Lorene...
E: enchanted by the name
C: LORENE
D: I haven't seen you in here before.
N: Prew gestures with the membership card.
C: PREW
D: I dint know about this place till now. A friend of mine brought me. We're stationed at Schofield.
C: LORENE
D: Oh. Somehow I didn't think you were a soldier.
C: PREW
D: Well, I am. And I'm in for the whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man.
E: bridles a bit
C: LORENE
D: I suppose it's different when a fellow is going to make a career of it.
C: PREW
D: There ain't anythin wrong with a soljer that ain't wrong with everyone else.
N: Lorene smiles her fatal smile at Prew's seriousness.
C: LORENE
D: I like you just the same. I liked you the minute I saw Annette bringing you in.
C: PREW
D: Me, too. I mean when I came in. I saw you over here --
E: MELTS
N: There is a commotion across the room. A group of man and girls are surrounding the piano. Fatso has stopped playing and a shouting argument is going on between him and Maggio. Prew looks over, concerned.
C: FATSO'S VOICE
D: I'll play loud as I want, ya little Wop!
N: A babble of voices drowns out Maggio's reply.
C: PREW
D: Friend of mine. You wait right here for me, will ya?
E: RISES
C: LORENE
D: Surely.
E: SMILES SWEETLY
C: MEDIUM SHOT AT PIANO
D: where two men are holding Fatso and three girls are restraining Maggio. The others are amused by the quarrel, but Fatso and Maggio are deadly serious.
C: MAGGIO
D: Mess with me, Fatstuff, I'll pull you apart!
C: FATSO
D: You're the kind of character I eat for breakfast, ya little --
N: Maggio breaks away from the girls and rushes toward Patso but Prew, stepping through the group, grabs him. Mrs. Kipfer bustles into the melee.
C: MRS. KIPFER
D: Now, you gentlemen know I will not have any of this sort of thing.
C: MAGGIO
D: Shut up, you Wop, he says to me!
C: FATSO
D: Little Mussolini here tryin to tell me what way to play the piano.
C: MAGGIO
D: Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust already with that noise!
C: MRS. KIPFER
D: You man can simply leave if you're not going to behave yourselves.
C: PREW
D: Come on, Angelo, come on --
C: MAGGIO
D: -- Ony my friends can call me Wop --
N: MEDIUM SHOT AT SIDE OF ROOM where Prew hauls Maggio away from the piano.
C: SOLDIER
D: You know who that guy is, buddy?
E: has been watching
C: MAGGIO
D: Sure, I know who he is. Whadda I care?
C: PREW
D: Who is he?
C: SOLDIER
D: Fatso Judson. Sergeant of the Guard at the Post Stockade.
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FATSO JUDSON settling down at the piano again. He glances over in direction of Maggio with a mean smile. Then he starts to hammer the keys viciously. MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO PEW SOLDIER as the music starts, Maggio stiffens, turns as if to go back. Prew holds tight, to his arm.
C: SOLDIER
D: -- I'm tellin you, leave him be. Nets danger. I seen him nearly murder a guy once. He likes it.
N: Sandra comes over, disengages Prew's arm from Maggio's, puts her own around him.
C: SANDRA
D: All right, bully boy, now you won the war, let's dance.
C: MAGGIO
D: First I got to calm my nerves. Come on with me to a phone booth or some thin. Where I will unveil this fifth of whisky I got under this loose flowing sports shirt.
E: beginning to quiet down slaps himself on belly
N: He and Sandra start off toward an adjoining room. Prew smiles, turns back toward Lorene. The smile fades. MEDIUM SHOT FROM PREW'S POV Lorene is looking at another soldier, on the couch beside her, with her rapt, innocent expression.
C: TRACKING SHOT PREW
D: as he crosses room to Lorene, hurt and disappointed. CAMERA HOLDS on MEDIUM SHOT as he comes up to her and the soldier, a talkative man named BILL.
C: BILL
D: -- you go along as fast as forty miles per through that surf and your balance has got to be letter perfect.
C: PREW
D: Hey, I thought you were gonna wait.
C: LORENE
D: Bill here was telling me about surfboarding.
E: looks up, smiles
C: BILL
D: Hello, friend.
C: LORENE
D: Sit down and just listen. He describes it thrillingly.
E: PATS COUCH
N: Prew sits down, disgruntled. Bill notes his expression.
C: BILL
D: You know anything about surfboarding?
C: PREW
D: No. Nothing. Not a thing.
C: BILL
D: You must be stationed inland then. I'm at DeRussey so I get lots of chances.
C: PREW
D: Yeah? But then we got mountains. You know anything about mountain climbing?
C: BILL
D: A little bit. Are you a mountain climber?
C: PREW
D: No. You know anything about flying an airplane?
N: Lorene is frowning now.
C: BILL
D: I've had a few lessons.
C: PREW
D: Well, I can't fly either. What do you know about deep sea diving?
C: LORENE
D: Do you want to move into another room, Bill?
C: BILL
D: Sure. The air in here seems to have gotten very smelly, hasn't it?
C: PREW
D: Yeah, I noticed that, too --
C: BILL
D: Listen, fellow --
C: LORENE
D: Shall we go, then?
N: She and Bill rise. She smiles tremulously at him as she takes his arm and they start off. She throws a severe glance over her shoulder at Prew.
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: He settles lower in the couch, the picture of frustration and hopelessness. He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it.
S: EXT. KUHIO PARK - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT PARK BENCH
D: Karen sits on the bench, her ankles crosses primly, very ill at ease. There is Payday activity here also; amorous strolling couples; men in ones and twos looking for pickups. Several unattached men pass Karen, ogle her. She is about to get up and leave when Warden comes into shot, stands over her. His civilian suit is neat and well-cut. Both are strained, awkward, antagonistic. Now that the step has been taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one.
C: KAREN
D: Why, hello. I didn't think you were coming.
C: WARDEN
D: Why not? I'm not late.
C: KAREN
D: No, I guess you're not. But then I came a little early. I must have been overanxious. You weren't overanxious though, were you? You got here right on the dot.
C: WARDEN
D: Maybe I'd of been early too only I stopped to get a drink.
C: KAREN
D: You certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting.
C: WARDEN
D: Would you rather it'd been the cocktail lounge of the Royal?
C: KAREN
D: No, but I've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes.
C: WARDEN
D: (sits beside her on the
C: BENCH)
D: That's par for the course around here.
C: KAREN
D: Well, I don't care for it. I never went in much for back-alley loving.
C: WARDEN
D: Didn't you?
C: KAREN
D: You probably think I'm a tramp, don't you?
C: WARDEN
D: What makes you think I'd think that?
C: KAREN
D: Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant. If you think this is a mistake, come right out and say so.
C: WARDEN
D: Listen, what started all this, anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher! Where'd I come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander's wife! And her actin like Lady Astor's horse all because I only got here on time!
E: OUTRAGE
N: Warden's burst shatters the tension. Karen breaks into laughter. After a moment, Warden joins in.
C: KAREN
D: On the other hand, I've got a bathing suit under my dress.
C: WARDEN
D: Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It parked around the corner.
N: He takes her hand. They rise and walk away, backs to camera. They merge with the other couples in the little park.
S: INT. LARGE CLUB ROOM - NEW CONGRESS - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT COUCH
D: Fatso's piano music o.s. Prew is slumped on the couch. He stubs out the cigarette, which is almost burnt down. He sees someone coming toward him, slowly raises his eyes. Lorene comes into shot, looks down at him.
C: PREW
D: How's the surfboard rider?
C: LORENE
D: That was a terrible way to have acted. What you did.
C: PREW
D: I was jealous.
C: LORENE
D: You're a funny one.
E: LAUGHS
C: PREW
D: What do you dames want? To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire?
C: LORENE
D: (angry because she really
C: LIKES PREW)
D: Now, look here, what do you think Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're hired to be nice to all the boys. They're all alike. Is it so important?
C: PREW
D: Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike. All right, I'm sorry about before.
E: STANDS; URGENTLY PAUSE
C: LORENE
D: That piano is about to drive me out of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's suite and sit there. She lets us use it sometimes... for somebody special.
E: touched by his outburst
C: PREW
D: Are you mad?
C: LORENE
D: No, I'm not mad.
C: PREW
D: Because if you're still mad I'd just rather we called the whole thing off.
C: LORENE
D: You certainly are a funny one.
E: takes his arm
N: They walk away from camera, merging with the others in-the room.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT
C: FULL SHOT WAVE
D: sweeping over camera, spray flying.
C: MEDIUM SHOT ON BEACH
D: A tiny beach set among rocks. The pale sand glows in the moonlight. Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire about ten yards from the water's edge. Karen is just stepping out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath. A couple of GI blankets near the fire. Her teeth are beginning to chatter in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky longingly, happily.
C: KAREN
D: I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope I freeze in a solid chunk.
C: WARDEN
D: Just so long's you melt afterwards.
E: sudden, intense laugh
C: KAREN
D: I love the way you laugh.
N: He stands, moves to her. She laughs, turns and runs into the water. He runs after her.
C: FULL SHOT WAVE
D: near shore, as Karen dives into it. Warden follows her. The wave washes over them.
S: INT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - MRS. KIPFER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT DIVAN
D: CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch, their heads close together as if they have just kissed pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g. A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no effort now to be "the Princess." She speaks as if resuming a conversation.
C: LORENE
D: ... I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own. To get away from my home town. In Oregon.
C: PREW
D: How come?
C: LORENE
D: I had a boy friend. I was a waitress. He was from the richest family in town. He just married the girl suitable for his position. After three years of going around with me. It's a pretty story, isn't it? Maybe they could make a movie of it.
E: PAUSE
C: PREW
D: They did. Ten thousand of them.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: Lorene smiles.
C: LORENE
D: So I left and went to Seattle, as a waitress. And I met a girl just back from Hawaii. She said she'd made a lot of money working for Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first boat. I've been here a year and two months.
C: PREW
D: You like it much?
C: LORENE
D: Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it. Anyway, I won't be here forever.
C: PREW
D: No. Sure not. I mean, why should you?
C: LORENE
D: I have it all figured out. In another year I'll be back home, with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer. And then I will be all set for life --
N: There is a sound at the door and they turn towards it. MEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle. After a moment, Maggio's head follows the arm through the door. He is grinning like an amateur conspirator.
C: MAGGIO
D: I dint hear no sounds of combat. So I figgered maybe you'd like a drink.
C: THREE SHOT
D: as Maggio comes into the room.
C: MAGGIO
D: Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself. She's a fine girl. But she drinks like a fish.
N: There are glasses on a cupboard near the divan. Maggio sets three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them.
C: LORENE
D: No, thanks. I never drink much.
N: Maggio stops short of the third glass. He takes a big gulp from the first.
C: LORENE
D: I think it' a a weakness.
C: MAGGIO
D: I grant you that.
E: ANOTHER GULP
C: LORENE
D: And I don't like weakness. ) Do you?
E: TO PREW
C: PREW
D: No. I don't like weakness. But I like to drink.
E: rises, takes a drink
N: He comes back to the divan.
C: LORENE
D: With you it's not a weakness. With you it's more like a virtue.
C: MAGGIO
D: That sounds like a very profound remark. Maybe that's why I don't get it.
C: LORENE
D: Well, it's so.
E: snuggles to Prew
C: MAGGIO
D: Hey! What you gonna do, marry this guy? Way you grinnin at him you look like his wife!
C: PREW
D: Get outa here!
C: MAGGIO
D: Okay. Back to old long-legged Sandra. I love 'em tall. Acres and acres.
E: picks up bottle
N: He goes out, closing door behind him. Suddenly the door opens again and Maggio pops back in. He puts the whisky bottle on a table next to the door.
C: MAGGIO
D: Enjoy yourself, pizon. You need it more than me. You be back with The Treatment tomorrow.
N: He pops out again, the door closing after him. Prew's gaiety dims with the reference to The Treatment. Lorene sees this. Prew rises, goes to whisky bottle.
C: PREW
D: That was nice before. The way you snuggled up. In front of him.
C: LORENE
D: What's he mean, The Treatment?
N: Prew doesn't answer. He pours a drink, gulps it.
C: LORENE
D: What did he mean?
C: PREW
D: Some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because I won't fight.
C: LORENE
D: Fight?
C: PREW
D: On the boxing team. I don't want to fight! I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to think about it. And they make me think about it. Every day.
N: He drops down on the divan beside her.
C: PREW
D: It's a personal thing...
N: His dread of telling the tale crumbles before his overwhelming need to tell it, to have someone understand.
C: PREW
D: Over at Port Shafter... I used to fight... Middleweight. I was pretty good. I used to work out with Dixie Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he was fast... And good. He loved boxing. He was gonna come out of the Army and go right into the upper brackets... People on the Outside had their eye on him. Dixie didn't want, to use the six ounce gloves this time. And we neither of us wore headgear, anyway. I was set flat on my feet when I caught Dixie wide with this no more than ordinary solid cross. Dixie just happened to be standing solid, too.
E: rises, paces MORE
C: PREW
D: From the way he fell I knew. Dead weight, square on his face. He dint roll over. He was in a coma a week. Then he finally came out of it. The only thing was that he was blind... I went up to the hospital to see him. Twice. Then I couldn't go back. We got to talking about fighting the second time. And Dixie cried... Seein tears comin out of those eyes that couldn't see...
E: CONT'D sits on chair rises, paces
N: There are tears on Prew's face. He turns away from Lorene. ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING FROM BEHIND PREW Lorene, very moved, goes to him, stands behind him, puts her hand on his shoulder. Prew does not turn but his hand grasps hers. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT of the hands.
S: EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT NEAR SHORE
D: A wave sweeps by camera, Karen and Warden riding it into shore. CAMERA PANS with them as they walk out of the water, hand in hand. They stop at edge, as if by a mutual impulse. He swings her to him and kisses her.
C: CLOSEUP
D: as they kiss. The embrace is impassioned. When their lips separate, their arms remain around each other, holding tight to something they find is more than sex alone.
C: EXTREME CLOSEUP
D: as Karen and Warden kiss again, a tenderness in him not seen before and which he normally takes great pains to hide.
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
D: as their lips separate again.
C: KAREN
D: Nobody ever kissed me that way... not really...
N: They are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to the kisses. The jump to banter is a quick defense.
C: WARDEN
D: Nobody?
N: CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they walk to the fire. Karen smiles at him.
C: KAREN
D: No. Nobody.
C: WARDEN
D: Not even one? Out of all the many men you've been kissed by?
C: KAREN
D: Well, that will take some figuring. How many men do you think there've been?
N: CAMERA HOLDS as they sit, beside the fire. Karen wraps one of the blankets around her.
C: WARDEN
D: I wouldn't know. Can't you even make me a rough estimate?
C: KAREN
D: Not without an adding machine. Do you have your adding machine with you?
C: WARDEN
D: No, I forgot to bring it.
C: KAREN
D: Then I guess you won't find out, will you?
C: WARDEN
D: Maybe I already know.
N: The defense has given way and there is no mirth in the questions and answers now.
C: KAREN
D: What's the matter? What are you hinting at?
C: WARDEN
D: Why? Is there something to hint at?
C: KAREN
D: I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe you just think there's a lot.
C: WARDEN
D: Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a long line of beach parties --
C: KAREN
D: You must be crazy -- !
C: WARDEN
D: Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here. But what about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss?
N: Karen flings off the blankets, snatches her dress, stands up, raging. She speaks as she pulls the dress over her head, wriggles into it.
C: KAREN
D: I had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. For a minute I had to convince myself you were different --
C: WARDEN
D: Only it's true, ain't it?
C: KAREN
D: Yes, it's true! A part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. Some day perhaps you'll get all the story.
C: WARDEN
D: All what story?
E: YAPS UP
C: KAREN
D: You're getting to sound so much like a typical male. So you just sweat it out like a typical male.
N: She starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach, walking fast, then almost running. Warden runs after her. MEDIUM SHOT BEACH NEAR PATH UP ROCKS as Warden catches up with Karen. He grasps her arm roughly, hauls her down onto the sand. He stares at her bitterly, waiting f or her to speak.
C: KAREN
D: All right. I've never told it to anyone before. But I think now is the time. I'll tell you the whole bloody messy thing. You can take it back to the barracks with you.
N: She speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts. For much of the story her face is in shadow, as if a cloud is passing across the moon.
C: KAREN
D: I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone.... I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens.
E: pauses, then rushes on
C: ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
D: reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen.
C: KAREN
D: Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs.
C: WARDEN
D: Listen.
N: TWO SHOT
C: KAREN
D: He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine.
C: WARDEN
D: Listen. Listen. Please.
C: KAREN
D: And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on living with him.
C: WARDEN
D: The hateful, miserable --
C: KAREN
D: You hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again.
C: WARDEN
D: Listens Listen to me --
C: KAREN
D: All right. I'm listening.
N: Warden shakes his head, inarticulate with his rage and love. Karen moves closer to him.
C: KAREN
D: I know. Until I met you I didn't think it was possible, either.
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN:
S: INT. DAYROOM - NIGHT
C: PAN SHOT AROUND ROOM
D: Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a quiet blues. There are scattered groups,about fifteen men in all -- playing pool, ping-pong, reading, writing letters, talking. CAMERA REACHES PRIVATE SAL ANDERSON and Friday Clark, playing the guitars and singing. Clark plays only passably, but Anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors. Friday, the bugler, is about twenty-four, with shy, trusting eyes. Anderson is the same age, also quiet, non-aggressive. CAMERA CONTINUES PANNING, PASSES a soldier reading a newspaper who shakes his head and mutters, "... ain't it terrible about Lou Gehrig dyin...", then MOVES IN to HOLD on a group at a window seat, bulling. Prew is stretched out wearily, looks as if he's been through another recent dose of The Treatment. Maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive robin. Treadwell slouches at the end of the seat. Pete Karelsen is in a chair nearby, reading a magazine.
C: TREADWELL
D: ... Ah'm in the Army because Ah can live better on the Inside than on the Outside.
C: PREW
D: It ain't the reason I'm in.
C: MAGGIO
D: Now he's gonna give us that snow about bein a Thirty-Year Man again.
C: PREW
D: That's right. Look at Karelsen there. Only seven years more for rockin chair money.
N: Karelsen hears his name, looks over.
C: MEDIUM SHOT KARELSEN
D: CAMERA AT ANGLE so we see he's reading a full-page advertisement featuring a girl in a revealing negligee. He is feeling sorry for him;elf.
C: KARELSEN
D: The Profession wears you down, though, young man. Down thin like a knife what's been honed and honed. All that good steel just rubbed away...
N: He turns back sadly to study the figure of the girl. MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING ANDERSON AND CLARK OTHERS IN B.G. Anderson peels off a flourish as he and Clark end their song.
C: TREADWELL
D: Man, that's blues! Where'd you drag that one up Prom?
C: ANDERSON
D: Oh, just stumbled on it.
E: BASHFULLY
N: He strums aimlessly again. Prew and Treadwell come over to listen, prop themselves on chairs. During following, several others stroll over and a soldier writing at a desk nearby stops, turns to listen.
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: warmed by the friendliness of the music and the moment.
C: PREW
D: They got Truckdrivers' Blues... Sharecroppers' Blues... Bricklayers' Blues... We oughta have a Soljers' Blues...
C: MEDIUM SHOT GROUP
D: as Anderson repeats a theme he has happened on. It has a haunting melody.
C: CLARK
D: Hey, look... I betcha we could make one out of what you just played. Do that again.
N: Anderson repeats the melody.
C: ANDERSON
D: I could bring it down to a third line major ending... Regular twelve bars blues.
C: TREADWELL
D: I bet I got two hundred blues records back home.
E: MORE
C: TREADWELL
D: But there ain't one could touch that. And that includes Saint Louis. And it could be ours...
E: CONT'D
N: The men wear pleased smiles, delighted by the idea of possessing something quite rare and truly their own. Prew flips his cigarette into a can.
C: PREW
D: I got it. We call it the `Re- enlistment Blues'!
N: There is a chorus of approval.
C: PREW
D: Lookit, w e could start it with the guy getting discharged. Hey, fella, can I use this?
E: reaches over to desk
N: The soldier at the desk nods, and Prew takes his pencil and paper. He writes down the words of the song as they are composed during following.
C: PREW
D: How's this? 'Got paid out on Monday... Not a dog soljer no more... They gimme all that money....'
N: He stops, stuck. Anderson plays the melody and Prew sings the words to this point. Friday Clark chimes in suddenly.
C: CLARK
D: 'They gimme all that money... So much my pockets is sore...'
N: They laugh. Anderson sings. Prew writes furiously.
C: ANDERSON
D: 'More dough than I can use. Re- enlistment Blues...'
C: ANGLE
D: Anderson plays a series of chords, then repeats the last two lines as the whole group joins in.
C: GROUP
D: 'More dough than I can use. Re- enlistment Blues...'
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY
C: FULL SHOT
D: Raucous, hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues. On the floor of the gym Dhom is punching the bag. In a corner of the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope. In the center of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring. Holmes hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice.
C: MEDIUM SHOT PREW
D: He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor. There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. Above his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope. In b.g. of shot is Wilson, seated near ring.
C: GALOVITCH'S VOICE
D: Some day you get sense in your dumb head, Prewitt, you be up here instead down there!
N: A fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over Prew but he keeps about his work.
C: WILSON
D: Still makin out you like it, huh?
C: MEDIUM SHOT IN RING
D: There are two water buckets near Galovitch. He skips near one of them, kicks it. The bucket falls on its side and dirty water spills over the ring and down onto Prew.
C: GALOVITCH
D: Clean up dis mess, Prewitt!
N: Prew gets to his feet. Galovitch resumes skipping rope.
C: GALOVITCH
D: And look a life, hurry it up. You on fatigue detail, not vacation.
N: Prew climbs into the ring, gets on his knees, starts to swab up the canvas. He is nearly finished when Galovitch "accidentally" kicks over the second bucket.
C: GALOVITCH
D: Clean up, Prewitt!
N: Prew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage. He throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor.
C: PREW
D: Clean it up yourself!
C: GALOVITCH
D: How? What!
C: PREW
D: You heard me -- rub your own nose in it a while!
C: GALOVITCH
D: What!
N: Prew starts out of the ring. Holmes intercepts him.
C: HOLMES
D: What's the matter with you, Prewitt? You know better than to talk back to a non-commissioned officer.
C: PREW
D: Yes, sir. But I have never liked being spit at, sir. Even by a non- commissioned officer.
C: HOLMES
D: I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.
C: PREW
D: I don't think I owe him no apology. In fact, I think one's owed to me.
E: RECKLESSLY
C: HOLMES
D: Sergeant Galovitch, take this man to the barracks and have him roll a full field pack, extra shoes, helmet and all, and then take a bicycle and hike him up to Kole- Kole Pass and back. And see that he hikes all the way. And when he gets back, bring him to me.

S: EXT. ROAD - DAY
N: LONG SHOT Par below in the shot are Prew, hiking, and Galovitch, riding behind him on the bicycle. The dirt road is steep and the sun pours down, steaming hot. MOVING SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH Prew is hunched under the seventy-pound pack as he plods along. He is sweat-soaked, puffing, dog-weary. Galovitch's bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on Prew's heels.
C: GALOVITCH
D: Move along. You not half way yet. Three more miles to top.
N: A jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and moves down the road. It slows its speed and pulls up when it nears Prew and Galovitch.
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: The jeep is driven by an enlisted man. Sitting next to him is MAJOR GENERAL SLATER. Galovitch hops off the bike and he and Prew snap to attention. General Slater leans out of the vehicle. He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of the two men.
C: GENERAL SLATER
D: At ease. Where're you men headed?
C: GALOVITCH
D: Top of pass, Sir. This man insubordinate. The Captain is teaching him lesson.

D: Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's desk. Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He has regained his old expressionless look. Warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene. Holmes looks
N: Prew up and down, half-smiles.
C: HOLMES
D: I take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now.

N: Prew about-faces and goes out. Galovitch follows. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN HOLMES IN B.G. Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose back is to him. Disgust is reflected on his face. MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES Holmes slams his fist on his desk.
C: HOLMES
D: 1 know that kind of man! He's an againster. A bitter-ender. You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to tame him, like an animal! Warden, I want you to prepare court martial papers. Insubordination and insolence to an officer.
E: TO WARDEN
C: WARDEN
D: Yes, sir.
N: Warden swings around to his own desk. He thinks for several moments, tries to sound quite casual.
C: WARDEN
D: Too bad you got to lose a middleweight like that...
C: HOLMES
D: Why? Do you see any other way of breaking him?
C: WARDEN
D: I don't know... But even if he only gets three months, he'll still be in the Stockade when the boxing finals come up.
N: He looks over at Holmes, sees him scowling, weakening.
C: WARDEN
D: How about just giving him a good stiff Compny punishment for now?
N: Holmes ponders the situation unhappily, rubs his hand over his face,. shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much for him.
C: HOLMES
D: All right, all right. But throw the book at him.

N: CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALING Karelsen across the room, undressing tiredly, achingly. Warden is sharp and blustering, using Karelsen as an escape valve. During following he goes to his footlocker, opens it, takes out whisky bottle, drinks.
C: WARDEN
D: I'm through! I'm turnin in my stripes. I mean it, Pete. I could transfer out tomorrow. In Grade -- get that? To half a dozen Compnys in this Regmint!
C: KARELSEN
D: Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too, except I can't stand leaving all my old buddies.

S: INT. CHOY'S - NIGHT
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OLD CHOY An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white- aproned, bustling, Americanized. CAMERA PANS WITH him, DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate. GROUP SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE
C: STARK

C: KARELSEN

C: NOSE)
D: The Canal Zone for me. This girl down there. She was a planter's daughter, see. She lived a very sheltered life. A very moral young lady, Milt. I took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing. It was a great shock to her to learn about life. But she took it well. She got to like me very much after that.
C: WARDEN
D: The last time I heard it you told it different.
C: KARELSEN
D: Well, what did you expect? I was in a different mood, then.
C: MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
D: Maggio, Anderson and Treadwell are comparing snapshots from home, spreading them out on the table. Mazzioli is talking to Prew with great earnestness.
C: MAZZIOLI
D: ... it's in regulations. You've got a right to complain. You've got a right to take your case to the Inspector General. Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.
C: PREW
D: I know it. I'm not complainin to nobody. They ain't goin to get the satisfaction of seein me squirm.
N: Clark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox music, noodling an uninspired obligato.
C: MAGGIO
D: ... believe it nor not, this is one soljer who's got a family -- look, fifteen of 'em.
E: pointing to pictures MORE

C: PREW
D: Only my reglar turn.
C: MAZZIOLI
D: Well -- I was working in the Orderly Room this afternoon and I heard the Captain telling Warden you're to pull KP every weekend from now on. You know what that means -- you can' t even go into TOWN --
C: PREW
D: Whadda they want? They done everything, now they look me in a box! What else they gonna try?
N: Clark hits a sour note an the bugle.
C: PREW
D: When you gonna learn to play a bugle!?
E: SAVAGELY
N: In overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle away from Clark's mouth. In one motion he wipes the mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music.
C: FULL SHOT CHOY'S
D: as Prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the room. Everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns toward Prew.
C: CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: reacting. He frowns, moved by the cry behind the music.
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW'S TABLE FEATURING MAGGIO as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend nakedly revealed on his face. ANOTHER ANGLE PREW'S TABLE FEATURING PREW Hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly as he has begun. He has played perhaps fifteen seconds in all. He puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now, the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded.
C: MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR
D: The room is quiet for several moments, except for the continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now. Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door. Some of the men see him, but no one greets him. Fatso threads his way between tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the men turn back to their beer.
C: MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
D: as Fatso passes. He stops, leans over Anderson's shoulder to look at the snapshots on the table. He points to one picture, a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing Hollywoodishly in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly.
C: FATSO
D: Who's that? Who's that dame?
C: MAGGIO
D: My sister.
E: IMPASSIVELY
N: Fatso whistles. He picks up the photograph, stares at it, whistles again.
C: FATSO
D: Whoever! Say, she's a real good piece of whistle bait! I'd sure like to get my mitts around her.
N: He laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on the table, starts to move on, Maggio rises, picks up the heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down on Fatso's head with all his strength,
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops abruptly. Fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but does not go down.
C: FATSO
D: Why, holy -- I You hit met You hit me!

E: CALMLY RAISES STOOL

D: What?! But what for? That's no way to fight! Why, you dirty yellow sneaking -- Wop! You yellow little Wop! If that's the way you want to play!
E: reaches hand to head, brings away blood
N: With his last sentence, Fatso whips out a knife and snaps open the blade. The blade is at least five inches long. It glints evilly as he raises it. There is a concerted whisking intake of breath from the room. Murder is clear on Fat sots face. MEDIUM SHOT NEAR PREW'S TABLE (EXCLUDING WARDEN) Maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as Fatso advances toward him. Men sprawl away from them.
C: SOLDIER'S VOICE
D: Hey, it you want to fight, fight with fists. Take it outsides
N: There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. A couple of men are about to rise. Fatso whirls toward them.
C: FATSO
D: I'm gonna cut this little Wop's heart out. Anybody steps in here, I give it to him first.
N: MEDIUM SHOT OLD CHOY AND YOUNG CHOY side by side. Old Choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes almost closed. Young Choy is shaking with fright. MEDIUM SHOT FATSO AND MAGGIO Fatso turns toward Maggio, who circles back around the table as the other stalks him.
C: MAGGIO
D: I'm gunna de-brain ya, Fatso! One step closer an I'm gunna kill ya!
E: scared but brave; shouts
N: Fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike. Warden comes into shot suddenly. He brandishes a beer bottle wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority.
C: WARDEN
D: Nobody's gunna do nothin! Anybody's killin anybody around here, it'll be me!
N: Warden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one in each hand. He steps between Fatso and Maggio.
C: FATSO
D: Look outs here, Warden. This a private affair.
C: WARDEN
D: No it ain't! This man's in my Compny an I'm responsible for him. And you ain't makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him. Nor him you. Put that knife down!
N: He smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the wagged edge at Fatso, roars:
C: WARDEN
D: Put it down!
N: Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio.
C: WARDEN
D: Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on, you want some killing, come on! Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you comin?
E: whirls on Fatso
N: Neither Fatso nor Maggio moves.
C: WARDEN
D: Killers! You'll get plenty of killing, all right. More than you got the stomach for. You'll be in a war one of these days. When you feel that lead from a sniper's rifle hit you between the eyes, come and tell me how you like it. Killers! Now put down that chair.
E: with mammoth contempt turns to Maggio
N: Maggio puts down the stool. Warden turns to Fatso.
C: WARDEN
D: Throw that knife on the floor.
N: Fatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is another audible whoosh of breath from the room.
C: WARDEN
D: Almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you? Is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you?
E: finally lowers his voice
N: He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.
C: FATSO
D: Tough monkey. Hard sister. Guys like you get to the Stockade sooner later. One day you walk in there I'll be waitin. I'll show you a coupla things.
N: He walks away, drops into a stool at the counter.
C: MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE
D: Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks.
C: MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
D: Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He half-whispers to Prew.
C: MAGGIO
D: I made a mistake I guess, but I don't see how I could of done anything else, after that big stoop said a thing like that.
N: Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor.
C: PHEW
D: I'll tell you your mistake. You didn't hit him hard enough to put him out.
C: MAGGIO
D: I hit him hard as I could. His head must be solid ivory.
N: In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass.
C: MAGGIO
D: Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it. He's a good man, you know it?
N: As if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out.
S: EXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT

C: CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick.
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty.
C: PREW
D: ... That was a near thing.
C: WARDEN
D: ... Yeah.
N: Prew holds out Fatso's knife. Warden is beginning to get control of himself; he manages a weak smile.
C: WARDEN
D: You keep it, kid. Keep it for a souvenir.
N: Prew puts the knife in his pocket. They stare at one another a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express some deep emotion of respect.
C: WARDEN
D: You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?
C: PREW
D: They can kill you but they can't eat you, Top.
E: THIN SMILE

C: PREW
D: How about Dynamite?
C: WARDEN
D: Leave Dynamite to me. He signs most anything I put in front of him `thout readies it.

D: Now you done it.
E: AGHAST
N: MEDIUM SHOT END OF PATH NEAR STREET The two MPs came running onto the path, spot Maggio and Prew about thirty yards away. MEDIUM SHOT PEW AND MAGGIO Maggio picks up his shoes, suddenly whips away from Prew and runs toward the MPs. ANOTHER ANGLE NEAR MPs as they stop, surprised. Maggio is shouting, "Can't a man do nothin?!" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other, directly at the MPs. One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the latter reaches out and grabs him. Maggio wrenches loose but instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly. In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back. The first MP charges Maggio. Maggio grabs the second MP's club and hits the first MP over the head.
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: Horrified, he starts toward the fracas.
N: MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND MPs IN F.G. PREW IN B.G. The second MP has managed to get out from under Maggio. He smashes his fist into Maggio's face as the latter continues to wield the club. Maggio sees Prew coming toward them.
C: MAGGIO
D: Get back! I'm handlin this! Take off!
N: The first MP starts to intercept Prew. Maggio tackles him around the knees and brings him to the ground. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SECOND MP Club gone, his partner on the ground, the second UP fishes for his pistol, tugs to get it from the holster.
C: MAGGIO'S VOICE
D: This ain't your affair! Keep out of this!
N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW IN F.G. MPs AND MAGGIO IN B.G. Prew sees the second MP raise his pistol, point it toward him. CAMERA PANS WITH him as he turns quickly and dives headlong into bushes nearby.
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: CAMERA MOVES WITH him close to ground as he knees and elbows his way along deep into the bushes. He stops, breathing hard. The sound of the MPs fighting with Maggio can be heard, the ugly sound of fists and the uglier sound of clubs smashing bone and flesh.
C: MAGGIO'S VOICE
D: Come on. Is that the best you can do? I bet you eat Wheaties, don't you? Come on... You can't even knock me out -- no matter --
E: screaming, crazed
N: Maggio's voice stops suddenly. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSEUP of Prew on the ground, his face contorted. The voices of the MPs are heard now, panting.
C: FIRST MP'S VOICE
D: I wonder what was wrong with this guy. He must be same kind of madman.
C: SECOND MP'S VOICE
D: Come on, let"s get him into a wagon.
N: A convulsive sob escapes Prew as his head drops in the dirt.

S: INT. ORDERLY ROOM- DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT PEEN WARDEN MAZZIOLI Warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board. Prew sits on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees, chin in hand. There is a quiet tenseness in the room. Warden looks over at Prew, turns back to the bulletin board. Mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a window. The screen door slams and Leva enters, eating a candy bar.
C: LEVA
D: Any word on Maggio's Court Martial?
C: MAZZIOLI
D: It's on right now. At Headquarters.
N: Lava sits on the bench beside Prew, shakes his head.
C: LEVA
D: He'll get the Stockade sure.
N: The others tense at the word "Stockade," glare at Leva as if he had no right to mention it. Their fear of the place, now that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on their faces. There is a long pause.
C: MAZZIOLI
D: Maybe he won't get it. All he did was get drunk and run wild. That's a soldier's nature. It's almost his sacred duty once in a while.
N: There is another pause. Warden barks suddenly, fiercely, at Leva.
C: WARDEN
D: What you hangin around here for?
C: LEVA
D: Can't a man rest himself for a min--
C: WARDEN
D: What man? I can't stand to see people restin themselves. I'm eccentric. If you ain't got no work maybe I can scare you up some.
N: Mumbling, Leva rises and goes out. Warden goes over to Prew.
C: WARDEN
D: Whyn't you go on over to the Day Room, shoot a little pool?
E: MORE
C: WARDEN
D: I'll let you know when the word comes through.
E: CONT'D
N: Prew looks up, nods, rises. He is half-way to the door when the phone at the Clerk's desk rings. Prew turns. Mazzioli stares at the phone as if afraid to touch it. Warden goes over, answers.
C: WARDEN
D: Compny G, First Sergeant Warden speaking... Yes, sir... Yes, sir, I will... I'll have his things in order... Yes, sir.

C: CLOSE SHOT RECONNAISSANCE CAR
D: Maggio sits between the driver and another MP, both armed. The G Company men cluster around the car, ad-libbing greetings, kidding Maggio, bucking him up. Even the Sergeants join in this; nobody likes to see a man on his way to the Stockade.
E: NOTE: These are not the same MPs with whom he fought.
C: MAGGIO
D: Hello, men! Who's got the beer?
C: DRIVER
D: Shut up!

D: I'm a prisoner. And prisoners ain't allowed to talk. They allowed to breathe though. If they good, that is.

S: INT. OFFICE OF SERGEANT OF THE GUARD - DAY
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: CAMERA SHOOTS from behind a man seated at a desk. Prominent in shot is a wicked-looking chopped-off hoe handle lying on the desk. Maggio enters, recognizes the man. He walks, up to the desk, his face set in defiance. Music is rising in a fearful crescendo. CAMERA PANS just enough to REVEAL desk sign reading: "SERGEANT OF THE GUARD." The man stands up and the music stops abruptly.

D: Shot covers the continuation of all the above activity. This is a native luau - definitely not for tourists. Shot includes long ditches, heated by red-hot stones and lined with layers of banana leaves, containing pig, chicken, rock crabs, fish... Pots of native stew... Bowls of exotic fruit... Peels of raw cane... Working over the food are the natives, many of the men stripped to the waist, the women arrayed in colorful Hawaiian costumes.
N: LONG SHOT THROUGH BONFIRE HULA DANCERS A group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a group of old Hawaiian instruments. This is far removed from the night club Hula. This is a thing of swift, agile angularity, primitive and powerful. PAN SHOT SPECTATORS THROUGH BONFIRE At end of PAN, CAMERA REVEALS Warden and Karen in the group.

C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: protesting, joining in the laughter. Suddenly he kicks off his shoes, rolls his slacks up to his knees. He snatches a gardenia from the hair of a pretty Hawaiian girl next to him, sticks it over his ear, jumps into the firelight and dances with the others. The music comes up louder and faster as the spectators and dancers roar.
N: GROUP SHOT DANCERS AND WARDEN They are all laughing as they dance, but as Warden moves with them it is apparent he is as good as any of them.

D: nodding, pointing at Warden, their hilarious laughter fading to delighted smiles.
C: CLOSE SHOT KAREN
D: astonished and thrilled at Warden's ability.
C: MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN
D: His laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he dances. In all he dances about thirty seconds. Then he breaks out of the group and runs over to Karen.
N: GROUP SHOT FEATURING KAREN AND WARDEN as the spectators and dancers shout their applause. Warden comes up to Karen and puts the gardenia in her hair. Karen is glowing, tingling.
C: KAREN
D: You just love to shock people, don't you?! Where on earth did you learn to dance like that?
C: WARDEN
D: Believe it or not -- Chicago, Illinois.
E: PANTING HAPPILY
N: She flings her arms around him passionately. The onlookers howl with approval and merriment. Between Karen and Warden and camera, an enormously fat Hawaiian woman pours water on the stones in one of the trench-ovens. A cloud of steam rises, hiding them.

S: INT. ALMA'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY (TWILIGHT)
C: FULL SHOT
D: Prew stops on the threshold, stares at the room in happy amazement. It is large, smartly furnished. In the rear, glass doors lead to a porch. One of the panelled walls is filled with bookshelves, floor to ceiling. The bookshelves are filled with books. A hearty feminine voice calls "Hi!" from the kitchen, and as Prew and Alma come into the room, GORGETTE enters from the kitchen. She is a very tall, very gay, good-looking girl.
C: ALMA
D: This is Gorgette, my roommate. Gorgette, this is Prew. I told you about him.
C: GORGETTE
D: Don't mind me. I'm going out in a little while.
N: Prew grins, can't keep his eyes off the astonishing books. Gorgette follows his glance.
C: GORGETTE
D: I belong to the Book of the Month Club. I always take every book. That way I get all the dividends.
N: She giggles and goes off to the bedroom.
C: PREW
D: She'll be great for Maggio when he gets out of the Stockade. He'll be crazy about her because she's so tall.
N: Alma smiles, presses him into a chair.

D: SHOOTING through smoke rising from one of the trench-ovens. As it clears we see the enormous Hawaiian woman and one or two others cleaning up and putting out the remnants of the fires. The merrymakers and dancers have gone; the luau is over. In b.g., quite alone, are Warden and Karen, sitting on
N: the trunk of a fallen palm tree. MEDIUM SHOT KAREN AND WARDEN The abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone. They survey the emptiness. The fat Hawaiian woman comes near, rakes ashes over one of the dying fires. She speaks to Warden in Hawaiian. He answers her in the native tongue. The fat woman stares, shrugs, goes off.
C: KAREN
D: What did she say?
C: WARDEN
D: She said it's over -- time to go HOME --

D: I know.
N: He rises, paces a moment.

D: If there were only a way! Your lovin husband'd probly give you the divorce. But even if he didn't know what for, he'd never let me transfer.
C: KAREN
D: (bucking up courage;
C: QUIETLY)
D: There is a way. I've been thinking about it.
N: Warden looks at her apprehensively.
C: KAREN
D: You've got to become an officer.
C: WARDEN
D: What!
C: KAREN
D: You're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft. When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States -- new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men. Then --
C: WARDEN
D: You sure made a thorough study of it.
C: KAREN
D: Then I could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you.
C: WARDEN
D: An officer! I've always hated officers.
C: KAREN
D: That's a fine, intelligent point of view. Suppose I said I've always hated Sergeants. That would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?
C: CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: He sits, thinks it over unhappily.
C: WARDEN
D: Okay, suppose I did it. -- And don't think it's a cinch -- the exams are tough. Then you'd be getting your divorce here while I'm in the States. We'd be apart maybe six months! We'll probly be in the war by then --
N: TWO SHOT
C: KAREN
D: You can't be certain of that --
C: WARDEN

D: I'll probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this Army.

It is playing "Why Don't We Do This More Often?" A table still contains the dinner plates. Prew's expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show. He misses a step, stumbles.

E: HURT
C: ALMA
D: A very funny one that I cannot figure out.
C: PREW

C: ALMA
D: Because I'm a girl you met at the New Congress Club! And that's about two steps up from the pavement.
C: PREW
D: Okay -- I'm a private no class dogface soljer. And the way most civilians look at it, that's two steps up from no thin.
N: There is a silence. Alma is honestly distraught.
C: ALMA
D: Oh, Prew, Prew, I thought we were happy: Why do you want to spoil things?
C: PREW
D: Lissen, I ain't think in of now. But I got a plan cookin in my head. You want to go back to the States in a year. Well, you could stretch it some, make it two years. And I could swing a Sergeant's stripes -- If I were a non-com the Army'd let me pick my duty when I re-enlist. (lost in the picture of
C: IT)
D: And there's some posts back in the States -- like Jefferson Barracks -- The married noncoms rate solid brick houses... with lawns with new- cut grass and walks with big old oak trees...

N: CLOSE SHOT PREW
C: PREW
D: I could fight.
N: TWO SHOT
C: PREW
D: It I go out for boxin he'd send me to non-com school. The Regimental Championship is next month. I bet I could win the middleweight even without training. I used to be pretty good I could do it.
N: Alma is deeply moved. She speaks gravely, sincerely, not at all immodestly.
C: ALMA
D: No. I don't think you should give in to The Treatment... even to marry me.
C: PREW
D: This'd be worth it.
C: ALMA
D: Prew -- it's true we love each other now. But back in America, it might be different... We might not even want each other...
E: ALMOST DESPERATELY
C: PREW
D: Okay. But that ain't the real reason.
C: ALMA
D: All right. It's not.
C: PREW
D: What's the real reason you won't marry me?
C: ALMA
D: I won't marry you because I don't want to be the wife of a soldier.
C: PREW
D: Well, that's the top I could ever do for you --
C: ALMA
D: Because nobody's going to stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing. Because want to be proper.
C: PREW
D: Proper?
C: ALMA
D: Yes, proper. Respectable. Secure. In a year I'll have enough money saved. I'm going back to my home town in Oregon and I'm going to build a new home for my mother and myself and join the country club and take up golf. And then I'll meet the proper, man with the proper position. And I'll be a proper wife who can keep a proper home and raise proper children. And I will be happy because when you are proper you are safe.

N: The victrola record ends. Alma turns away from Prew and goes to the victrola. Now that shots had her say with such certainty, she deflates. Except for the fact that she looks like a girl who never cries, she looks as if she might cry. She lifts the record off the turntable.
C: ALMA
D: But I do mean it when I say I need you. Because I'm lonely. Sometimes I'm dreadfully lonely... You think I'm lying, don't you?

D: I'm not going to hide anything. I'm just not going to tell you.
N: She applies herself to her food, anxious to drop the matter.
C: HOLMES
D: One thing I know. I know it's a civilian. You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.
C: KAREN
D: I don't think it's any of your business who he is.
C: HOLMES
D: It is my business! I'm your husband! What do you think a scandal would do to my chances for a promotion? So if you're thinking of a divorce, you can forget it!
N: Karen stiffens. She struggles to maintain her self- possession. She manages it, keeps outwardly calm through the scene.
C: HOLMES
D: Now -- how does it feel to know you'll have to live with a horror like me the rest of your life?
C: KAREN
D: Not very nice. But then there's the compensation of knowing you'll have to live with me the rest of your life.
N: Her attitude makes Holmes progressively sorrier for himself. CAMERA MOVES with him as during following he rises, goes to stove, pours himself another cup of coffee. He spills a little and the liquid sizzles on the burner.
C: HOLMES
D: You don't know how a man feels about a thing like this. It breaks a man all up -- inside.
C: KAREN
D: I gander why men feel so differently about it than women.
E: DRYLY
C: HOLMES
D: It's -- it's just not the same.

C: HOLMES
D: Why do you think I've done all I have...?
C: KAREN
D: Done all what?
C: HOLMES
D: Tried to be a Company Commander when I hate it, worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad, tagged after the General whenever I could.
C: KAREN
D: I don't know. Why?
C: HOLMES
D: Why, for you and for me. For our home, that's why.
C: KAREN
D: I always thought you did it because you wanted to get ahead.
E: DRYLY
N: She finishes the last of her food, stands.

D: It's a lovely day out. I think I'll go for a walk.
N: Holmes catches her wrist, stops her.

D: He's a good boy.
C: NAIR
D: Course, he throws up a little blood now and then. And he passes out a lot. But Fatso sure ain't reportin none of that. So there's no way they goin to find out.
C: PREW
D: Why don't he go to the C.O.?
C: NAIR
D: We tried to get him to. But he won't peep. He says he got a lot more scalp to lose first. That boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital. But he's got a heart just like a great big baby.
E: with great sentiment
N: Prew's face has been growing in fury. He pulls up a clump of sod, throws it down with all his might.
C: PREW
D: You think he's gonna be all right?
C: NAIR
D: Your guess is worth mine, sam. Maybe he's crackin a little at that -- cause after Fatso put him in the Hole -- that's what they call solitary -- a couple times he began talkin about how he's gonna e- scape. He said to tell you he'll look you up one of these nights.
N: A shadow falls across the grass in front of Prew. SHOT GALOVITCH FROM PREW'S POV CAMERA SHOOTING UP from near the ground, the ANGLE EXAGGERATING Galavitch's ungainly, ape-like figure. He looks down at Prew, full of venom.
C: GALOVITCH
D: Still on knees, eh, Prewitt? Well, boxing finals next month. December f if teen. You s till got time help us make champions.
N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW FROM GALOVITCHE'S POV Prew is at the breaking point. Controlling himself, he weeds around Galovitch's shadow. It moves in front of Prew again.

C: MEDIUM SHOT GROUP

C: PREW
D: Get outa my way, Ike. I ain't gonna move around you again.
C: GALOVITCH
D: You need better lesson than up to now. Maybe I give to you myself. Maybe right now.
N: He steps on Prew's hand. As Prew jerks away from the heavy shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt. Thornhill steps between them.
C: THORNHILL
D: Ey, leave him alone. `e's in my DETAIL --
E: TO GALOVITCH
N: Prew shoves Thornhill aside, cold decision in his eyes. He starts unbuttoning his shirt.
C: PREW
D: All right. It's gonna be your way.
E: TO GALOVITCH
N: Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize fighter.
C: THORNHILL
D: Ey, wait a minute, you guys -- !
N: Prew is barely able to get out of his shirt before Galovitch charges him. VARIOUS ANGLES PREW AND GALOVITCH AND SPECTATORS During following men run from across the quadrangle and from out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around the fighters. Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times. Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never throws a punch at the other's head.
C: NAIR
D: The head, Prew! Hit him in the head!
N: The other men around shout similar advice.

N: CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES
C: CLOSEUP PREW
D: flinching without being hit. He seems mesmerized by the other's eyes.
N: CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH fighting. Galovitch draws blood from a cut over Prew's eye. He is getting the better of the battle. In b.g. Thornhill breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle. MEDIUM SHOT BALDY DHOM AND SPECTATOR

C: DHOM
D: He blinded a guy once. Must be scairt of the same thing.

S: INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY
N: LONG SHOT OUT WINDOW To FRONT OF BARRACKS SHOOTING OVER heads of men watching, out to Prew and Galovitch on the ground. Dispassionate, professional ad-libs from the men: why does Prew continue his attack to the body only, a good little man and a good big man, etc.

N: Holmes goes out. Thornhill follows, turns at the door.
C: THORNHILL
D: Ain't you want to see it, First?

C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: He stares at the picture, then looks at the application blank. Then he looks down at the chevrons on his arm. He rubs his hand over the chevrons gently, fondly. He looks at the application blank again very thoughtfully.
S: EXT. BARRACKS - DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH ON LAWN A continuation of the fight. Prew is tiring, his face is cut and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye. Galovitch is unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his stomach. He seems perplexed, as before, by his opponent+s tactics.

C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: FEATURING the "ath-a-loots," including Dhom, Wilson and Henderson. They are watching quietly, nodding with approval as Prew feints, then darts several punches into Galovitch's ribs, It almost seems as if they are admiring Prew's courage, inwardly rooting for him. Holmes enters the group, Thornhill tagging after him. Holmes stops and watches the fight. There is a look of satisfaction on his face.
N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH The fight continuing.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: near rear of crowd. An officer, walking across the lawn, is attracted by the noise. He steps into the crowd. This is COLONEL WILLIAMS. He wears the insignia of the Inspector General's Department. He watches the fight, is about to step through to break it up when he sees Holmes. He stops, watches Holmes' reactions.
N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH Prew, backed up against the crowd, trips over somebody's feet. He falls without being hit. Galovitch kicks at him and Prew rolls away. The crowd murmurs angrily. Sergeant Stark steps out into the open circle, faces Galovitch.

D: Galovitch, surprised and hurt, throws up his hands. Prew drives both fists to his solar plexus. Galovitch drops his guard. Prew smashes him in the face and Adam's apple. Galovitch falls to his knees, hawking and choking.
N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH The whole nature of the fight has changed. Galovitch, hurt and reeling, rushes Prew, bull-like, head down, defense wide open. Prew dodges easily, slamming hard with rights and lefts to the head.

E: PUFFING
N: A laugh from the crowd.
C: HOLMES
D: You won't disobey any more orders in my Company, Prewitt. Warden saved you from a court martial once but he won't this time --
N: Anderson steps into the circle.
C: ANDERSON
D: Sir -- I'm sorry, sir but Private Prewitt's not to blame for this. Sergeant Galovitch started it.
N: Holmes reacts, momentarily at a loss. He turns to Thornhill.
C: HOLMES
D: Thornhill, you're in charge of this detail. How about it?
E: MEANINGFULLY
N: Thornhill steps into the circle, nods toward Anderson.
C: THORNHILL
D: `e's right, sir. `e begun it. Prewitt done nothin.

N: MEDIUM SHOT NEAR ENTRANCE TO CHOY'S The music from across the road almost lost in the laughter and shouts from the beerhouse. Warden comes out, wobbles a bit. He has One On. He cups his hand over his ear, straining to hear the singing. He stumbles into Choate, coming along the sidewalk.
C: CHOATE
D: Top, you sure plastered.
C: WARDEN
D: I am off duty. Off duty if I want to get plastered --
E: MUSTERING DIGNITY
N: But Choate has gone into Choy's. CAMERA RETREATS with Warden as he wanders to the road, still trying to locate the singing.

C: PREW, ANDERSON AND CLARK
D: Ain't no time to lose Re-enlistment Blues...
E: SINGING
N: Anderson, as usual, finishes the stanza with a brilliant display on the guitar. Prew stands up. In the glow of a streetlight his face shows the marks of his battle with Galovitch. He wobbles and we realize he, too, really Has One On.

C: PREW
D: Lorene.
E: HESITATES
C: WARDEN
D: Oh, yeah, I remember. Lorene. Beautiful name.
N: Warden claps Prew on the shoulder as if he is a lifelong friend. They smile. They look as if they are sharing a great secret, a secret known to them alone in the world. The mournful guitars and singing comes over a little louder.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: The headlights of a jeep descend upon Warden and Prew. Then the vehicle skids into the shot with a screeching of brakes, comes to a halt directly in front of the men. Warden and Prew look at the car calmly, don't move. The headlights are blazing on them. Stark hops out from the driver's seat, furious.
C: STARK
D: Whatsa matter with you, you crazy, dumb screwballs?! You tryin to get killed?!
C: WARDEN
D: What you doin with that jeep, Sergeant Stark?
C: STARK
D: I borrowed it. I'm goin to town. What you doin in the middle of the road?

D: I guess I'm the one who's nuts.
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT MAGGIO
D: as he stumbles around the side of the jeep directly into the blaze of the headlights. There are scars, new and healing on Maggio's face. One of his ears is cauliflowered, enough to give him the lopsided ribald look of a punchy. A couple of teeth are missing. Weirdly outlined in the glare, he is a nightmare figure, an apparition. The whine in the distance is identifiable now. It is the siren of the Stockade.
C: MAGGIO
D: ... figgered you might be at Choy's...
C: GROUP SHOT
D: The men gape at Maggio, unable to accept the shock of his appearance. Then Prew and Warden jump up and catch him as he is about to fall. The drunkenness drains out of them. Stark watches in bewilderment.

N: Taps. The first note is incredibly clear and loud and certain. It is held longer than most Buglers hold it. The second note is daringly short, abrupt. The last note of the first phrase rises, peals out, heartfelt. Two men come into the shot, smoking. They stop, turn toward the Bugler, listen attentively. One of them flips away his cigarette.

C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: at the Bugler's post. He is finishing the last phrases, full and wonderful. Behind him stands Friday Clark, motionless. The final note quivers to silence. Prew swings the megaphone for the repeat. Then the repeat begins, the clear proud notes reverberating across the silent quadrangle.
S: INT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

D: coming to the end of the Taps. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSEUP. Prew's face is wet with tears. His lips are pinched and red. He blows the final notes.
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW AND CLARK Prew lowers the bugle slowly and lets the megaphone rest in its swivel. He withdraws the mouthpiece, puts it in his pocket. He hands the bugle to Clark. Clark looks at the instrument as if it has become hallowed. Prew walks off into the darkness.

C: FATSO
D: Okay. You sore about somethin?
C: PREW
D: No. I just don't like the way you play the piano.
N: Fatso throws back his head and laughs loudly.
C: PREW
D: You know Maggio?
C: FATSO
D: The little Wop? The one who bust out of the Stockade? Sure. He was a real tough monkey. But crazy, see?
C: PREW
D: You killed him.
C: FATSO
D: Did I? If I did, he ask for it.
C: PREW
D: I hear they're gonna court martial you, Fatso. But before the Army gets you, I want a piece of you myself.
N: There is the snick of a blade snapping open as Fatso pulls a knife. He moves toward Prew, who steps swiftly to one side.
C: PREW
D: I kinds thought you'd try that.
N: There is the same sound as Prew pulls a knife from his pocket, snaps it open, holds it out flat in his hand, showing it to Fatso.
C: PREW
D: This here's the one you pulled on Maggio once. Reconize it?
N: Fatso darts at Prew, knife raised. Prew moves back, but Fatso is on him and they both roll to one side along the building. The movement throws them deep into the shadows. ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING INTO THE SHADOWS The two figures feint and dart. There is the occasional silver flash of the knives as light hits them. The men go deeper into the shadows, are all but lost to view. There is a startled, pained cry. Then one of the figures falls to his knees and starts to crawl toward camera. CLOSE SHOT SHOOTING NEAR GROUND as the figure comes directly to camera, REVEALING the anguished face of Fatso. It slowly turns, is upside down in the frame.
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: Fatso is on his back, his stomach gushing bloods his eyes already glazing. Prew staggers into the light now. His left side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly. He stares down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice.
C: FATSO
D: You've killed me. Why'd you want to kill me?
N: Prew backs away from Fatso, turns, staggers down the alley away from camera. WIPE TO:
S: EXT. CLIFF ROAD - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: Prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road. His side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers blood-soaked. He stops close to camera. He wads his handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife wound. He smiles wearily, crookedly.
C: PREW
D: Gonna have an awful bad scar there...
E: mumbles to himself
N: He lights a cigarette, his fingers shaking. The flame from the match illuminates his left wrist. There is a deep scar on it. It seems to fascinate Prew as he stares at it, rubs his fingers across it.
C: PREW
D: ... scars...
N: He turns, moves on up the road; CAMERA MOVES CLOSE behind him, as if overhearing his thoughts which come over on sound track.
C: PREW'S VOICE
D: ... got that one fallin off the barn back home... gashed it on a spike... Dad laughed... Dead now... Uncle John+s dead, too...
E: O.S.
N: Prew moves away from camera out of shot. WIPE TO:
S: EXT. CLIFF ROAD - NIGHT
N: TRACKING SHOT ANOTHER SECTION OF THE ROAD CAMERA FOLLOWS Prew, as he keeps in shadows, moves slowly up the cliff. He is in much pain now. His hand rubs across his face; his fingers linger on his forehead near his eye.
C: PREW'S VOICE
D: ... that cut over the eye... in the ring at Myer... wouldn't let `em stop it... knocked the guy out... sixth round...
E: O.S.
N: CAMERA LOSES Prew again as he stumbles into shadows. WIPE TO:

N: MEDIUM SHOT ALMA AND GORGETTE The radio is blaring the "Hut Sut Song." Alma is crocheting. Gorgette is reading. CAMERA SHOOTS across them to the front door. The doorknob moves slowly, the door opens. Prew falls into the room and pitches to the floor.
C: ALMA
D: PREW --
N: She rushes to him, bends over him. Gorgette runs to the radio, turns it off.
C: CLOSE SHOT ALMA
D: Her face agonized as she leans over Prew.
C: ALMA
D: Prew!
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ALMA AND PREW He pushes himself up on one elbow, seems pleased by her stricken expression. He manages a smile.
C: PREW
D: Don't worry... Ain't gonna die. They savin me for better things...
E: WEAKLY
N: Gorgette kneels into shot. Prew's smile becomes silly as he turns his head to her.
C: PREW
D: ... just came up to borrow a good book.

S: INT. GENERAL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT GENERAL SLATER COLONEL WILLIAMS HOLMES The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office. Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report.
C: COLONEL WILLIAMS
D: --- In addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid Private Prewitt. This extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team. These findings are the result of personal investigation by the Inspector General and are corroborated by numerous members of G Company.
N: Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk. Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he has really expected something like this for a long time. He makes no move to speak. The General is angry clear through.
C: GENERAL SLATER
D: I'm waiting for your reply to this.
C: HOLMES
D: I haven't any, sir... The charges -- are true.
C: GENERAL SLATER
D: Holmes, the first thing I ever learned in the Army was that an officer takes care of his men. It seems to be the first thing you forgot. It's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops. And believe me, you won't be for long. My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded. GENERAL SLATER In the meantime, of course, I'm relieving you of your present duties.
E: MORE cont'd
N: He indicates the meeting is over. Holmes rises, is about to leave, pauses.
C: HOLMES
D: If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir. Any way...
N: The General frowns, is unresponsive. Holmes looks to Colonel Williams helplessly.
C: COLONEL WILLIAMS
D: There is one alternative, General... if you're so disposed. A resignation for the good of the service under AR 600-275.
C: GENERAL SLATER
D: I'll give you a chance you don't deserve, Holmes. Write a letter of resignation and have it on my desk this afternoon. I'll consider accepting it. Only because as far as I'm concerned, the quicker you're out of the Army the better for everybody. Especially the Army.
E: thinks a moment

S: INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: MEDIUM SHOT KAREN AND HOLMES He confronts her, waving a sheet of stationery. His voice is strangled, almost hysterical.
C: HOLMES
D: --- that's right, it's a letter of resignations I'm through! I've already been relieved! So you can begin packing. We're sailing for the States next week!
N: She shakes her head, not wanting to believe; she takes the letter out of his hand, starts to read it. She stops after a sentence or two. Her hand falls to her side. Holmes sits on the bed heavily. The bluster bleeds out of him. He shakes his head, emotionally bewildered. For perhaps the first time in his life he is nakedly honest.
C: HOLMES
D: Where has it gone, Karen? What happened to it? The gay, cheerful life we were going to have, you and I...? What happened to me...? The proud, dashing officer was going to be. The leader of men?... I've known all along how the men felt about me. They despised me... What's happened? I don't remember losing anything... Where has it all gone?
C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT KAREN
D: reacting; she is surprised, a little afraid of her own emotion. The outcry, so lost, so despairing, moves her. She is sorry for him.
N: MEDIUM SHOT HOLMES AND KAREN
C: HOLMES
D: Karen -- you're coming back with me, aren't you...?
N: Trembling, Karen puts the letter on the dressing table. Abruptly, she runs out of the room.

S: INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
C: CLOSE SHOT DESK
D: FEATURING placard reading LIEUTENANT ROSS. We hear Ross' first few words over this, then CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM SHOT. Ross is forceful, clean-cut, gives the impression of toughness but fairness. As he talks he takes down the photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the wall. Watching and listening are Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill, Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson. Ross is such a complete switch from Holmes that the men are almost unnerved by him. But a definite respect is reflected in their expressions. Warden, beside his desk, shares this.
C: ROSS
D: -- I don't intend to have a sloppy outfit. I don't intend to have a goldbrick outfit. I don't intend to have a soft soap outfit. I've called you noncoms in because you're the backbone of any Company.
E: MORE

D: From now on you'll have to prove you're entitled to have those stripes here. And not in the boxing ring.
E: CONT'D

C: LEVA
D: Yes, sir.
C: ROSS
D: That's all I have to say. If you've any questions, speak up.
N: Nobody speaks.
C: ROSS
D: Dismissed.
N: The men troop out, passing camera. As last man leaves, CAMERA IS ON Warden. He is looking at Ross with considerable approval, even admiration. He resumes a more normal expression as Ross turns toward him.
C: WARDEN
D: One non-com was missing, sir. Sergeant Galovitch.
C: ROSS
D: I know. Private Galovitch is in the kitchen.
C: WARDEN
D: In the kitchen?
C: ROSS
D: As of now, he's an assistant cook. I busted him. On a blanket charge of inefficiency. What are you grinning at?
C: WARDEN
D: I think the Company Commander made a wise decision, sir.
E: GRINNING
N: The phone rings. Warden goes to his desk, answers.
C: WARDEN
D: Compny G, First Sergeant Warden speaking.
E: INTO PHONE
N: Karen's voice is heard on the phone; we cannot understand what she is saying, but a flood of words pours through. With Ross looking on, Warden is embarrassed.
C: WARDEN
D: Yes... Yes, I know... Yes, the - uh - parcel has already arrived... Yes... What?... No. No, we'll have to talk about it soon. Right away. I - I don't know...
E: INTO PHONE glances over toward Ross GRIM NOW
N: Ross perceives Warden's distress. He starts toward the door. Warden nods gratefully. Ross smiles, leaves the room.
C: WARDEN
D: Lissen, I'll get away somehow, tonight. I'll meet you in Kuhio Park. At eight... Right....
E: INTO PHONE
N: He puts down the receiver. He stares at the desk. Then he slowly pulls out the top drawer. The Officers Application Blank is lying on top of a pile of other papers. He takes it out, looks at it somberly. CAMERA MOVES IN to an INSERT of the Application. We see Warden's answers to sex, age, race, etc. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the page to the place for the signature of the applicant. It is unsigned.

C: LONG SHOT
D: In b.g. Warden, in uniform, and Karen are sitting on the same bench as in their first meeting in the park. We cannot hear what they are saying at first. CAMERA MOVES IN past a few pedestrians and HOLDS on a MEDIUM SHOT. There is a defeated, tired look about them, as if they have been talking for a long time to no avail.
C: KAREN
D: ... I guess I felt it that night I asked you to become an officer. When you didn't say yes right away.
E: MORE
C: KAREN
D: I guess I knew deep down you wouldn't do it. But -- It seemed such a simple plan for us...
E: CONT'D a hint of tears
C: WARDEN
D: I wanted to -- I tried -- but I couldn't...
N: He runs his hand through his hair. He seems to be groping inside himself for some way to explain.
C: WARDEN
D: Lissen -- there's a kid in our outfit named Prewitt... Robert E. Lee Prewitt... He came in from the States about a year ago. I thought he was a fresh punk at first... until I got to know him a little. He's AWOL right now -- probly in some kind of real trouble -- he ain't the kind to go AWOL otherwise. Anyway, I keep remembering somethin he said to me the first day he came in. He said a man has got to go his own way... if he don't, he's nothin... I'm an Enlisted Man. I'm a First Sergeant. Milt Warden. Once I cross that line and tried to be an officer, I'm somebody I don't know. A stranger. And a man has got to be what he is...
C: KAREN
D: I guess that's the trouble with Dana... He's always tried to be something he isn't. Poor Dana... I don't think he ever needed me until now. Well, here we are saying goodbye. And talking about two other people.
E: shaken herself out of it
C: WARDEN
D: We're not saying good-bye -- we'll figger out a way for you to stay HERE --
C: KAREN
D: I'm going back with him, Milt. There's something in being needed. It isn't love. But it's something.
C: WARDEN
D: Lissen, two people who love each other just don't stop loving each other! Nothin and nobody is goin to break us up l 1111 transfer out somehow and get back to the States. Maybe it'll take a little time but I'll do it!
E: DESPERATELY

D: That sounds like Milt Warden, all right.
E: SMILES
N: He bends toward her to kiss her. She presses him back.
C: KAREN
D: No, Milt. I don't want to kiss you any more. I just want to remember you. And you to remember me.
C: WARDEN
D: Put it down. Put it down that on December 6th, 1941, Milton Anthony Warden told you he'd remember you...

N: MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND ALMA Alma is reading a newspaper in b.g. Prew is disheveled and slovenly, needs a shave badly. His face is lined with pain. He is drunk from several days of steady drinking, stone drunk, as if in a trance. He wears crumpled civilian clothes. He is at a table laboriously writing out the Re-enlistment Blues. He finishes writing a stanza and sings softly.
C: PREW
D: Slep in the park that Sunday Seen all the folks gain to church Your belly feel so empty When you're left in the lurch --
N: Alma looks up from the paper.
C: ALMA
D: Here it is -- they're putting it on an inside page already. `... still no clue in the fatal stabbing of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson...'

C: PREW
D: Dog soljers don't own pews Re-enlistment Blues...
C: ALMA
D: Did you hear me? Are you listening or not?
E: ANNOYED
N: Prew nods blankly. He rises slowly and walks across the room toward Alma. But his eyes are fixed on a whisky bottle on a table beside her. He moves stiffly, favoring his side, his face contorted. He picks up the bottle, pours himself a drink.
C: ALMA
D: Are you trying to set a new world's record?
E: COLDLY

C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: FEATURING Warden at the NCO table. He rises, carries his plate with him towards the chow line. A sudden, deep-toned, earthquake-like blast shudders through the room. The cups on the tables rattle. Warden stops, cocks his head. The men stop eating, look at each other.
C: ANDERSON
D: Must be dynamitin down to Wheeler Field.
E: to the room
C: CHOATE
D: Them engineers mighty ambitious Sunday mornin before eight o'clock.
N: The men resume eating. Warden moves a couple of steps toward the chow line when the second blast hits. It is much heavier and fuller.
C: CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
D: He has a hunch about this now. He reaches out to put his plate down, holding it very carefully in both hands. However, he doesn't bother to see if there is anything under it. The plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room.
S: EXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY

The men stretch their necks, following the plane. Then they look back up the street, CAMERA PANNING. Far in b.g, a column of black mushrooming to the sky. Warden dashes to Mazzioli. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT as Warden bends over him, hoists him to a sitting position. He is extremely gentle. Mazzioli's knee is laid open and is bleeding freely. Warden whips out a handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet.
C: MEDIUM SHOT

S: INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY
C: FULL SHOT

D: as Warden runs in. Broken glass lies all over the floor. Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's footlocker. He throws back the lid fiercely. His linen is polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc., digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky; it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily.
S: EXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY
C: FULL SHOT ROOF

From this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there is a wild cacophony of Jap planes, BARs, Karelsen's machine gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance. And Chief Choate, singing the Regimental marching song, loudly and lustily.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: as Warden comes up on the roof through the skylight. He shouts incoherently at the men. They shout back in a wild cheer. They are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their first big meal in years. In b.g. the Jap V has swung about and heads back. Warden grabs a BAR from the roof.
N: CLOSE SHOT FLASH JAP PILOT IN LEAD PLANE grinning as his plane dives, its guns roaring. His silk scarf ripples out behind him.

D: He lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride. "These are my boys. This is my Company," it seems to say. The men answer back with a great answering shout.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: Warden makes a tour of the roof, laughing, exhorting, slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback. They respond with tremendous spirit; they are having one hell of a time. We get only a snatch of what Warden is yelling.
C: WARDEN
D: -- Don't worry about wasting ammo! Throw your empty clips down into the yard. The loading detail will pick 'em up --
N: The sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard, blending into the rest of the noise. Treadwell runs to the edge of the roof, looks over. LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO QUADRANGLE At the Bugler's post, Friday Clark is sounding a call.

C: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: He is lying on a couch in pajamas. He has not shaven, his hair is unkempt. A Radio Announcer is heard over shot. Prew wakens, groggy with hangover and near-delirium, wrestles with the blanket over him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM SHOT, DISCLOSING Alma and Gorgette. They have negligees over their nightgowns, are listening to the radio. The Announcer's voice tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the tremor out of it.
E: NOTE: Transcripts of the actual broadcast have been requested.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
D: ... This is a real attack, not a maneuver. The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor. Please keep in your homes. Do not go on the streets. I repeat, this is a real attack. Japanese planes are bombing our naval and army installations. Civilians will remain in their homes. This is a real attack -

D: The Jap strafing attack is continuing. Their planes are making a figure 8 in the sky. Silhouettes of men on the roof can b e seen. Friday Clark is blowing his Cavalry Charge. In b.g. men of the loading detail are scurrying around. Lieutenant Ross runs into shot. CAMERA PANS him across the quadrangle toward the barracks.
C: MEDIUM SHOT NEAR BARRACKS
D: Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten men. He grabs a BAR and ammunition from them and runs into the barracks. The loading detail is working feverishly, same carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling them toward the Supply Room.
S: EXT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

D: He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the loading detail. But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole thing is still very unofficial.
S: EXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY
C: FULL SHOT
D: As before, pandemonium -- but controlled and efficient. The men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from excitement and exertion. Two Jap planes swoop past and the full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose. Lieutenant Ross clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the BAR and loading clips. The men greet him with a concerted cheer.
N: TWO SHOT LIEUTENANT ROSS AND WARDEN Ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps Warden on the shoulder.
C: DHOM'S VOICE
D: HERE THEY COME, MEN!
N: Sound of Jap planes comes up ear-splitting loud. Ross drops down behind a chimney, swings his BAR, fires. CAMERA MOVES TO INCLUDE Karelsen at the other side of the chimney, firing the machine gun. Two soldiers hang onto the bucking legs of the tripod. Two Jap planes pass in b.g. of shot, zoom off into the sky.

N: LONG SHOT OPEN FIELD SHOOTING FROM ROOF The Jap plane bursts into flame and crashes.

S: EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY

Clark jumps up instantly, resumes blowing the Charge. LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF JAP PLANE The same plane has gained altitude so that it is a few feet above the barracks as it heads straight for the roof.

C: LONG SHOT JAP PLANE
D: It misses the roof by a foot or two, zooms up at a weird angle. A thick cloud of smoke pours out of the engine. The plane falls off on one wing and crashes into trees at the end of the quadrangle.

N: smoke obscures the screen.

S: INT. LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
C: MEDIUM SHOT PREW
D: There are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the glass doors. The radio is on, volume low, and an announcer is droning out an account of Pearl Harbor. Prew, still on the couch in his pajamas, looks as if he has just struggled to wakefulness. He listens to the radio for a few moments in confused disbelief. He shakes his head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess. He shakes his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. Then as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he wrenches himself off the couch. He looks around at the dimly lit room.
E: not the one of the morning
C: PREW
D: Alma! Alma!
N: He goes to the blackout curtains, peeps out. Then he turns back to listen to the radio. Abruptly, he runs into the bedroom.
C: PREW'S VOICE
D: Alma!
N: The room remains empty for a few moments as the radio announcer goes on, continuing previous remarks.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
D: -- ready to fight and die for us, our Regular Army and Navy have this day upheld the faith and confidence we have always placed in them. They have proved their right to the esteem we have always had for them...
N: Prew comes back into the room. He has his shoes on, holds civilian shirt and pants in his hand. He starts to put them on hurriedly, his attention still focused on the broadcast. The front door opens and Alma and Gorgette enter. They are surprised to see Prew up. He nods at them, turns back quickly to listen to the radio as he continues dressing.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
D: ... the attack caused serious damage to many installations of which Pearl Harbor suffered the worst. RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE We will not forget this day -- and we will never let the Japanese forget it...
E: MORE cont'd
C: PREW
D: You said it! Who they think they're fight in? (incoherent with rage; to
E: yells at radio
C: GIRLS)
D: They're pickin trouble with the best Army in -- the best riflemen -- you know we the ony country on the face of the earth that uses the shooting gunsling, not the carrying gunsling. You know that?
N: The radio continues on under the scene. Alma and Gorgette speak breathlessly, in a rush.

C: ALMA
D: A house on Kuhio Street was bombed OUT --
C: GORGETTE
D: And the drugstore on McKully and King is smashed flat. And the man and his wife were killed --

C: PREW
D: I gotta get back to the Post -- I'll try to get in touch with you in a couple days --
C: ALMA
D: The Post? Tonight?
N: Prew nods vehemently, moves across room to a table.
C: ALMA
D: But why?
C: PREW
D: Why? There's a war goin on.
C: ALMA
D: But you can't! You're not fit yet -- you're weak as a kitten -- you're AWOL -- they'll throw you in the STOCKADE --
C: PREP
D: They'll be throwin `em out of the Stockade. They need every man they can get.
E: LAUGHS WILDLY
N: He picks up the sheet of paper with the "Re-enlistment Blues" written out on it, starts to fold it. Desperation is reflected on Alma's face; she turns to Gorgette, as if pleading for aid,
C: GORGETTE
D: Your side'll open up --
C: ALMA
D: And they'll find out it was you who killed that soldier!
N: Prew shakes his head, as if obsessed by only one thought.
C: PREW
D: Once I report in to the Compny I'll be all right. Once I get there. I gotta get back --
C: ALMA
D: But you'll never make it! There's MPs all over --
C: PREW
D: I'll make it. I'll go along the back roads. They'll let me in the West gate -- they'll know I'm a SOLJER --
N: He puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts for the door.
C: ALMA
D: Stay till morning!
N: Prew glances at Alma incredulously. She sobs suddenly, violently.
C: ALMA
D: Maybe if you stayed till morning you'd change your mind...
N: She throws her arms around him, clings to him.
C: ALMA
D: Don't go, Prew! I'll do whatever you want... We'll figure out a way to get to the States together... We can even get married... If you go I won't see you any more... I know it...
N: Prew holds her closely for a moment, then moves her away from him. He turns toward the door.
C: ALMA
D: (tears turning to
C: HYSTERIA)
D: What do you want to go back to the Army for?! What did the Army ever do for you? Besides treat you like scum and give you one awful going over and get your friend killed? What do you want to go back to that for?
N: Prew frowns as if he's not sure he heard correctly.
C: PREW
D: What do I want to go back for? I'm a soljer.
C: ALMA
D: A soldier! A soldier! A Regular. From the Regular Army. A thirty- year man!
E: LAUGHING WILDLY
C: PREW
D: Sure. A thirty-year man. With only twenty-six years to go.
E: GRINS
N: He opens the door quickly and slips into the darkness.

S: EXT. HIGHWAY ADJOINING GOLF COURSE - NIGHT
N: MOVING SHOT JEEP WITH THREE MPs The night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the dimmed headlights of the jeep. CAMERA SHOOTS PAST driver onto the highway as the jeep moves slowly along. The two other MPs clutch Thompson guns, try to scan the dark countryside.
C: FIRST MP
D: They say they seen parachutists land up in the mountains.
C: SECOND MP
D: I ain't worried about them. Sabatoors is what worries me.
C: DRIVER
D: Yeah. Theys the creepy ones. Walkin around just like ordinary civilians. I betcha they operatin all over these islands.
N: LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM SIDE OF HIGHWAY The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out of sight. As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing, are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. He is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. We hear his thoughts. The voice is labored and agonized.
C: PREW'S VOICE
D: ... almost home... ony across the golf course... now... now... no... wait... gotta be care?... gotta sweat it out...
E: O.S.
N: He groans, puts his hand to his side. In the feeble light from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand. He looks up and down the road.
C: PREW'S VOICE
D: ... it's clear now... gotta get home...
E: O.S.
N: Still crouched, Prew starts across the road. LONG SHOT OPPOSITE SIDE OF ROAD We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is visible, bent low, weaving a little. As he approaches the camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed headlights which flash on from the side of the road. Now we see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew.
C: MP'S VOICE
D: Halt!
N: Prew starts to run back across the road. A white spotlight flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him. Prew slips to one knee.
C: CLOSE SHOT PREW
D: looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. He has the appearance of a terrified animal. There is a wildness, a senselessness about him. The blotch of blood oozes and spreads over his shirt. He picks up a rock from the road.
C: MEDIUM SHOT
D: Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep.
C: MP'S VOICE
D: HALT!
N: Prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights. There is a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. Prew runs across the road and onto the golf course.
C: MEDIUM SHOT JEEP
D: The motor starts, The jeep moves out from its hiding place and starts across the golf course.
N: MOVING SHOT SHOOTING FROM JEEP Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the spotlight. He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. He heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he reaches the lip of the trap. He turns, yells something back at the jeep. It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep.
C: PREW
D: -- I'm a soljer! --
C: MP
D: That guy ain't no soljer -- he dint HALT --
C: MEDIUM SHOT PREW
D: standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on him. He turns, starts to dive into the trap. A blast of gunfire from the jeep hits him. He falls sideways into the trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot, crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring down on Prew. His eyes are open, looking up to the sky.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: CAMERA SHOOTS DOWN to Prew from top of trap. A portion of the jeep is in shot, but we are not able to see the MPs.

E: MORE cont'd
C: SECOND MP'S VOICE
D: Shut up.
N: The voices are lost as CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN toward Prew's open eyes. We hear his thoughts on the sound track, clear and fast at first and slow and almost inaudible as the CAMERA REACHES A FULL HEAD CLOSEUP.
C: PREW'S VOICE
D: ... sweat it out and sweat it out and wait and wait and wait for it... and now it's here... it's here... gotta see to do it well... gotta do it well... won't take long...

S: EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT
N: TWO SHOT WARDEN AND A LIEUTENANT COLONEL They are looking down to camera, which SHOOTS UP as if from point of view of Prew's body in the sand trap.

C: LIEUTENANT COLONEL
D: Where's your Company Commander?

C: LIEUTENANT COLONEL'S VOICE
D: Seems to be acme sort of poem.
C: WARDEN'S VOICE
D: Yes, air.
N: Very softly, so distant that we can only distinguish a word or two now and then, we hear the voices of Clark, Anderson and Prew singing the "Re-enlistment Blues." The plaintive melody continues under the rest of the scene. MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
C: LIEUTENANT COLONEL
D: And this. Whatever it is.
N: He holds Prew' s bugle mouthpiece up to the light, gives it to Warden. Warden holds it in his hand, stares at it. Under the "Re-enlistment Blues," even softer, farther away, we now hear Prew's bugle blowing Taps. It continues, with the song, to the end of the scene.
C: WARDEN
D: It's the mouthpiece of a bugle.
N: The Lieutenant Colonel looks at Warden closely.
C: LIEUTENANT COLONEL
D: Are you all right, Sergeant? Was this man a friend of yours?
