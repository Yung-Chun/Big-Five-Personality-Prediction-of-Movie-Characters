N: ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST Aron has been left alone. He holds a STICK which he "shoots" like a gun -- kachew -- as he creeps from tree to tree. Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the trees. He crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows. The shape appears again. It's a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron's age. Aron waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off. Aron hurries after her into a wooded grove, then stops short. A PILE OF NAKED CORPSES. Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a crude Star-of-David sewn to his tattered coat. He holds an OLDER GIRL, 14, in his arms. Nearby, three or four OTHERS emerge from hiding.

N: DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 22. 40A ANOTHER DAY (CAMP #1) 40A Food, such as it is, is being handed out to SEVERAL NEW ARRIVALS. Asael brushes Aron's hair. Rachel sits beside her grieving father. She looks at Aron. He looks back. Nearby, Tuvia and Malbin are building a shelter. Malbin is hopelessly inept. A wall COLLAPSES.
C: TUVIA
D: Fuck me! Have you never used a hammer?
C: MALBIN
D: Uh. No.
C: TUVIA
D: What is it you do, then?
C: MALBIN
D: I suppose...you'd have to say...I was...am...an intellectual.
C: TUVIA
D: This is a job?
C: MALBIN
D: I published a small magazine... actually a journal...well, more like a pamphlet. Zus passes them, his arm around the dark-haired beauty.
C: ZUS
D: Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my forest wife.
C: TUVIA
D: I see. Congratulations. Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them.
C: MALBIN
D: Interesting concept.
C: TUVIA
D: As long as his village wife stays in hiding.
C: MALBIN
D: Nice to know there are some things even Hitler can't destroy.
N: DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 23.
C: 40A CONTINUED: 40A
D: Suddenly the camp grows quiet. TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes dirty and torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle.
C: ZUS
D: Hello, boys, what can we do for you?
N: YOUNG MAN #1 Food. We want food. Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby.
C: ZUS
D: These little shits are holding us up. The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle.
C: ZUS
D: You little shits have the balls to shoot me? In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND.
E: CONT'D
C: TUVIA
D: This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share.
C: ZUS
D: No.
N: (MORE) YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 23A. 40A CONTINUED: (2) 40A

E: CONT'D
N: YOUNG MAN #1 You are Jews? GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 24. 40A CONTINUED: (3) 40A
C: ZUS
D: No. We're the Gestapo, you little shit.
C: TUVIA
D: Come. Sit. Put down your guns.
C: ZUS
D: Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove them up your ass.
C: TUVIA
D: Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia:
N: YOUNG MAN #1 Horodyszcze. The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there.
C: PERETZ
D: We haven't eaten in two days. My name is Peretz, this is Jacov.
C: JACOV
D: Two days ago there were three thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall.
C: ZUS
D: You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men look at one another.
C: JACOV
D: We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question.
C: ZUS
D: ...There was a child. Jacov shakes his head. Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face.
C: ASAEL
D: His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief.
E: to the newcomers
N: GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 25. 40A CONTINUED: (4) 40A
C: ZUS
D: So many dead.
C: TUVIA
D: I know.
C: ZUS
D: Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears.
C: ZUS
D: Why not us?
E: CONT'D
C: TUVIA
D: I don't know.
C: ZUS
D: I thought they'd be safe. I should have been with them.
C: TUVIA
D: No.
C: ZUS
D: I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly.
C: ZUS
D: Better to be rabbits? Hunted? Hiding? No... Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away.
E: CONT'D
N: LATER - BY THE FIRE Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites--
C: PERETZ
D: We are looking for partisans.
C: JACOV
D: What is the name of your otriad? Tuvia laughs ruefully.
C: ASAEL
D: What is an 'otriad?'
C: TUVIA
D: An armed brigade.
C: JACOV
D: We heard the Russians are beginning to organize.
N: SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 26.
C: TUVIA
D: Here?
C: JACOV
D: And also in the Lipicanska.
C: ASAEL
D: Then we are the Bielski Otriad. You want to join?
C: PERETZ
D: The Russians are fighters.
E: looks around
C: JACOV
D: --But you need a gun to join them. Without a gun you are nothing. They sabotage railroads and kill Germans.
C: ZUS
D: We will kill all the Germans you can handle. Starting tonight. They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and filth.
E: O.S.
C: ZUS
D: If you're not afraid to use that rifle.
E: CONT'D
N: MOMENTS LATER - JUST OUTSIDE OF CAMP -- Zus is loading Wilencki's gun.
C: TUVIA
D: --we must get what we need without killing. We can't make more enemies-- Zus concentrates on opening the breach.
C: TUVIA
D: --It won't bring your family back to life. Or Mama. Or Papa.
E: CONT'D
C: ZUS
D: Blood for blood. You had your revenge.
N: SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 27.
C: TUVIA
D: And I can still see their faces.
C: ZUS
D: 'Vengeance is mine.' Who said that?
C: TUVIA
D: So this is God's work you're doing, Zussie?
C: ZUS
D: No. Only YOU can play God. Save a few lives, take a few others...
C: TUVIA
D: We cannot become...like them.
C: ZUS
D: If only... Are you coming with us or not?
E: a hard look
C: TUVIA
D: Us?
C: ZUS
D: Peretz and Jacov.
N: (POINTEDLY) Asael, too. Tuvia looks over at Asael, who looks away.
C: TUVIA
D: You are making the decisions now? A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for command has grown more obvious.
E: to Zus
C: TUVIA
D: We wait for dark.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
C: A BURNING TRUCK
D: Lights up the night sky. A MAN comes running out of a tavern, the same man who loaded Jews onto trucks in an earlier scene.
C: MAN
D: My truck! WHO DID THIS TO MY TRUCK? Tuvia, Zus and the others appear out the shadows.
C: TUVIA
D: We did.
N: GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 28. The man stops short at the sight of their weapons.
C: MAN
D: Who are you?
N: (REALIZING) You don't understand. They made me give them my truck... Zus FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes down. They throw his DEAD BODY onto the burning truck.
T: CUT TO:
N: 43A A CLUSTER OF HOUSES - LATER THAT NIGHT 43A Zus and Peretz are backing out of an open doorway, FIRING BACK INSIDE AS THEY GO. From within, the sound of SCREAMS. ZUS THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU
C: COOPERATE WITH NAZI SCUM..!
D: FACES appear furtively at the windows of nearby houses. Zus addresses the little neighborhood, delirious with joy.
N: ZUS (CONT'D) WE ARE THE BIELSKI OTRIAD! WE ARE JEWS! YOU LIKE TO KILL JEWS! HERE WE ARE! WE ARE THE BIELSKI'S!
C: TELL THEM!
D: Tuvia looks around warily. This is getting out of hand.
T: CUT TO:
N: A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post. IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree.
C: UP AHEAD
D: The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER.
C: IN THE DITCH
D: Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD.
N: GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 29.
C: THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED
D: by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the Mahkarov. ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly.
C: PERETZ
D: Look--! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching.
C: TUVIA
D: Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them.
C: A GERMAN STAFF CAR
D: approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle, it slows and pulls off to the side --
C: DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH
D: Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and walks up the road to investigate.
C: PRIVATE
D: It's one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply.
E: in German; subtitled
C: SERGEANT
D: Move it off the road before the convoy passes. I'll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps out of the car and lights a cigarette. He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder.
E: in German; subtitled
N: IN THE DITCH - ZUS can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch.
C: A STREAM OF PISS
D: Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away...
N: GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 30.
C: THE PISSING SERGEANT
D: catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches. ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND. MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING, BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement.
C: UP THE ROAD
D: The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down the road. They give chase.
C: FROM INSIDE THE CAR
D: Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst. MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point- blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE.
C: INSIDE THE STAFF CAR
D: The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life.
C: MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD
D: Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING. Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN. FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private keeps running. Limping now.
C: JACOV
D: I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier.
C: FROM FAR AWAY
D: We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT.
N: GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 31. BACK AT THE STAFF CAR Tuvia stands, out of breath.
C: TUVIA
D: Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles.
C: ZUS
D: He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's blood. He begins calling out orders.
C: ZUS
D: Peretz, Jacov, check the car for guns... This one's yours. He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy. Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently.
E: CONT'D to Tuvia
C: ZUS
D: I'll check his pockets for more ammo.
E: CONT'D
C: TUVIA
D: Hurry--!
C: AT THE STAFF CAR
D: Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA.
C: JACOV
D: They were on their way to a party! They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia.
C: UP THE ROAD
D: Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older than Aron.
N: BACK AT THE STAFF CAR ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it.
C: ZUS
D: Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel. A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their victory.
C: PERETZ
D: Now we are real Partisans...
N: GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 32.
C: JACOV
D: To the Bielski Otriad!
N: SUDDENLY - ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS are rounding the bend. Troop trucks. The Staff Car was leading A CONVOY.
C: TUVIA
D: Into the fields! RUN! Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks.
C: TUVIA
D: Jacov, NO! THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE. Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN. Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not clear if they can make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES OVERHEAD turning the wheat fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering incandescence. Malbin is almost paralytic with fear. ASAEL doesn't know which way to run. He plunges into the WHEAT FIELD...but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD. ONE OF THE TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using its SPOTLIGHT to reveal him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after him.
E: CONT'D
C: SEEN FROM ABOVE
D: We watch as they CONVERGE on him.
C: TUVIA, ZUS AND PERETZ
D: Have almost made it into the woods when PERETZ IS HIT. He falls. Tuvia and Zus pick him up and half-carry, half-drag him into the sanctuary of the forest.
C: TUVIA
D: Zus. His rifle. Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon.
C: ASAEL, MEANWHILE
D: has realized his mistake. He tries to circle back toward the woods but the SOLDIERS move to CUT HIM OFF. He is fast, but not fast enough. We realize he isn't going to make it.
C: IN THE WOODS
D: Tuvia and Zus look at the scene with mounting horror.
N: DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 33.
C: TUVIA
D: Asael... He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim...
C: THE SPOTLIGHT SHATTERS
D: Plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out. ASAEL seizes the moment and dives to his knees, disappearing from view and CRAWLING NOW rather than expose himself. AN IRRIGATION DITCH is nearby. Frantically he DIGS into the soft mud on its banks. As he scrapes his hands raw, he can HEAR his pursuers drawing near, CALLING OUT to one another.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE FOREST CAMP - DAWN A somber mood. Tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge congealed in an empty pot. OTHERS stare listlessly into space. ONE MAN chews on a piece of leather, ANOTHER sucks on an old chicken bone. Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the captured schnapps. Nearby, Aron shares his ration of bread with Rachel. Little enough, but a connection is made. Peretz lies nearby. Malbin is trying to comforts him. There is nothing that can help him. Malbin looks to Tuvia.
C: SHIMON
D: They thought you were bringing food. Tuvia just stares at him.
C: SHIMON
D: Did the farmers stop you? Still no answer from Tuvia.
E: CONT'D
C: SHIMON
D: They had guns? Dogs?
E: CONT'D
C: TUVIA
D: No.
C: SHIMON
D: I don't understand. Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger.
C: SHIMON
D: The Talmud says if you save a life you must take responsibility for it.
E: CONT'D
N: DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 34-34A.
C: TUVIA
D: Again I have no idea what you are talking about. Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces.
C: SHIMON
D: I think you do.
C: VOICE
D: You are the Bielski's? A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall, well muscled, a rifle strapped over his shoulder.
C: ZUS
D: How'd you get past the Lazar?
C: BEN ZION
D: Who? Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning on an occasional tree for support. He finds the erstwhile sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him.
C: ZUS
D: You shit! You worthless shit! Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy, drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him again.
C: TUVIA
D: Enough!
C: ZUS
D: He walked right by you! Someone could have been killed! Tuvia pulls Zus off him.
C: TUVIA
D: I said, enough! Get up! Get up!
E: to Lazar
C: ZUS
D: If we were real partisans he'd be shot.
C: TUVIA
D: He made a mistake!
N: DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 35.
C: ZUS
D: MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes! As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF. Zus goes flying, tripping over, landing on his ass.
C: TUVIA
D: That's right, Zus. No mistakes. Like last night. First they will torture Asael...and then they will hang him. Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground.
E: looks at him
C: BACK IN CAMP
D: Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion looks up at him.
C: BEN ZION
D: You are Tuvia Bielski.
C: TUVIA
D: You know me?
C: BEN ZION
D: I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz. Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family.
C: MIRIAM
D: Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My sister lives on Passaya Street.
C: BEN ZION
D: The SD came without warning. Hundreds were taken. No one knows where.
N: DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36. THE WOMAN begins to cry.
C: MIRIAM
D: My poor sister...dear God, no... Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles:
N: WOMAN #1 We'd be better off in the ghetto...
C: TAMARA
D: At least here we are safe.
C: LOVA
D: There at least we had hope...
C: SHIMON
D: No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates.
N: WOMAN #1 We are hungry! This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult.
C: TUVIA
D: I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission.
C: RONA
D: Look what happened the last time.
C: TUVIA
D: That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard.
C: TUVIA
D: We could be here a long time. And we have to prepare.
E: CONT'D
C: LOVA
D: How?
C: TUVIA
D: Better security. Better at getting food and information-- (talking over their
C: OBJECTIONS)
D: --at making shelters. Whatever is needed. We all participate. We don't work against each other. At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object.
N: DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36A.
C: TUVIA
D: I want to kill Nazis, too, but we...just...cannot afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up.
E: CONT'D
C: ARON
D: Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken.
N: DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 37.
C: TUVIA
D: Or Asael. We... We-- (trying to hold it
C: TOGETHER)
D: --cannot lose anyone. He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them with tears in their eyes. This is what they need -- leadership, faith, something to believe in. And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced by something else. A new voice. From deep inside.
C: TUVIA
D: ...We will map out where we've been so as to not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can afford to give, and leave those who can't alone.
E: CONT'D
C: LOVA
D: The poorest farmer has more than us.
C: TUVIA
D: True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves. Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals. We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader.
E: his resolve growing with every word looks at them all
T: CUT TO:
N: 64A FALL IN THE FOREST 64A The trees take on color as if in celebration of their coming together.
C: KOSCIK'S FARM
D: All is quiet as Tuvia, Zus and Ben Zion watch from the woods.
N: SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 38.
C: TUVIA
D: Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the ready.
C: OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
D: Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them.
C: TUVIA
D: Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian:
C: KOSCIK'S WIFE
D: In the barn.
C: IN THE BARN
D: Zus calls out.
C: ZUS
D: Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find:
N: KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK that has been driven through his chest. A sign attached to the hook reads (in Polish) "JEW LOVER."
T: CUT TO:
C: KOSCIK'S NEWLY-DUG GRAVE
D: is just beyond the barn. Tuvia finishes piling on the last shovelful of earth. Koscik's wife stares straight ahead.
C: TUVIA
D: I'm sorry.
C: KOSCIK'S WIFE
D: Come.
E: a monotone
C: A ROOT CELLAR
D: dug into a hillside. Overgrown with tall grass it is undetectable. Koscik's wife opens the heavy door, revealing ASAEL, who emerges blinking into the bright light.
C: TUVIA
D: Thank God.
N: DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 39. Zus pulls his lost brother into a mighty embrace.
C: ASAEL
D: Zus.... ZUSSIE... I can't breathe. Zus lets him go and Asael reaches back into the root cellar.
C: ASAEL
D: Look. Two LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN -- BELLA and CHAYA -- emerge, tentative and scared. Though their dresses are dirty, it is obvious they were once expensive. Zus eyes them appreciatively.
E: CONT'D
C: ZUS
D: Asael... Well, well..
N: ASAEL (BLUSHING) Shut up. Look at this-- He has two more rifles and a large box of ammunition. Tuvia turns to Koscik's wife, deeply moved.
C: TUVIA
D: Thank you.
C: KOSCIK'S WIFE
D: Go.
E: turning away
T: CUT TO:
C: A FOREST TRAIL
D: They head for home. Zus walks beside Bella.
C: BELLA
D: --and then we fell into this horrible bog. Chaya saved me. Honestly, I can't swim at all.
N: DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 40. ZUS (MESMERIZED) Then I will teach you!
C: BELLA
D: We must have got lost a dozen times. I was absolutely resigned to die.
C: ZUS
D: No...
C: BELLA
D: Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the absolute worst? And that farmer, Mr. Koscik, kept making the most vulgar jokes, he said any girl who-- As they continue out of earshot, it appears as though Zus would be happy to listen for hours.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: A TOWERING PINE FOREST
D: Aron and Rachel are walking through the woods. For a brief moment, viewed through the eyes of the young, we see these woods as a magical place. Strange mushrooms, gnarled roots, an enormous spider's web glistening with dew.
N: THE CAMP HAS BEGUN TO SHOW PROGRESS Sentries are posted. Zus expertly helps with the building a bunker ("zemylanka"). There's a more permanent kitchen, a wash trough, a clothesline. Pinchas tends his goat. Though primitive and raw...a haven. SHIMON AND MALBIN ARE DIGGING A HOLE Their bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a sport and a pastime.
C: MALBIN
D: You're trying to tell me all politics is meaningless.
C: SHIMON
D: In the West a monster with a little mustache, in the East a monster with a big mustache. This is all I need to know about politics.
C: MALBIN
D: Your messiah will have a mustache, too, and a full beard.
C: SHIMON
D: No. The messiahs are all in politics, and they're killing us. Zus unloads two cut and stripped trees.
N: DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 40A.
C: ZUS
D: What's killing me is all your talking. Back to work. Malbin and Shimon go back to work.
C: MALBIN
D: And Roosevelt? He has no mustache.
C: SHIMON
D: My life in these woods is much easier because of Mr. Roosevelt, thank you.
N: DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 41. WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP TUVIA AND ASAEL review their plans.
C: TUVIA
D: We need to know what's going on in the villages, how the Germans patrol, who the informers are-- He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead he is watching as Chaya walks past.
C: TUVIA
D: Are you listening to me?
E: CONT'D
C: ASAEL
D: Yes.
C: TUVIA
D: What's her name?
C: ASAEL
D: Chaya. [I believe.]
N: TUVIA (YELLING)
C: CHAYA!
D: He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael smiles, embarrassed.
C: TUVIA
D: So talk to her.
E: CONT'D
C: ASAEL
D: I hardly know her.
C: TUVIA
D: You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation.
C: ASAEL
D: Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We need two guns at least...
C: TUVIA
D: Whose turn to go?
C: ASAEL
D: Zus.
C: TUVIA
D: You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods.
C: TUVIA
D: Go on...Go!
E: CONT'D re: Chaya
N: DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 A41-41A. Asael heads toward Chaya. NEAR A SHED ROOF - BEN ZION We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty. Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other newcomers how to clean a weapon.
C: BEN ZION
D: This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You fix the patch to the rod-- They do as he instructs.
C: BEN ZION
D: --then run it through the barrel... and don't lose the patch in the
E: CONT'D
C: BARREL--
D: Lazar looks up, sheepishly.
C: LAZAR
D: I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother,
N: MOTL...
C: ARKADY LUBCZANSKI
D: The village idiot. Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to him.
C: LAZAR
D: Thank you, Zus.
C: ZUS
D: It's nothing.
E: returning the rifle
N: DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 42.
S: A ROADSIDE - NEXT DAY

C: SHIMON
D: Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist.
C: MALBIN
D: You are not eating?
C: SHIMON
D: By my best calculation, today is High Holiday. I am fasting. Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in. One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to play. A bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen, eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter, civilized time. Ben Zion has left the new arrivals and approached Tuvia. He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows something is wrong.
C: TUVIA
D: What is it?
C: BEN ZION
D: The new ones, they are from Novagroduk. Your wife-- Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates...

C: TUVIA
D: When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing.
C: VIKTOR

C: TUVIA
D: They are people. Jews.
C: ZUS
D: Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses and wouldn't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street. Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands.

C: TUVIA
D: You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of Novagrudok? Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates into fists and elbows. Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him.
E: CONT'D
C: ZUS
D: Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head when suddenly he stops himself. The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily -- realizing that they have crossed some line.

D: Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft.
C: TUVIA
D: This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You will all learn to protect yourselves. A LITTLE BOY holds Lilka's hand and looks up at Tuvia in wonder. He cuts an iconic figure.

E: to Lilka
C: TUVU
D: Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot accommodate an infant's needs. Our bunkers are overcrowded so you will have to build new ones. He looks out over the sea of expectant faces.

N: THE CAMP AT DAWN - TO ESTABLISH 102A IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN 102A Lilka awakens to find TEN WOMEN wedged in beside her -- back to front -- like spoons. Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the pale morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice. She SCREAMS. The women around her wake up, terrified.
C: LILKA
D: Get them off! Get them off me!
C: CHAYA
D: What? Where?
N: LILKA EVERYWHERE! OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD...
C: RIVA
D: Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria. She stumbles out, stepping on several others as she goes.
N: 102B OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 102B Crying, she tears at her clothes -- only to discover Tuvia and OTHERS staring at her with interest. She is mortified. 102C LATER THAT DAY 102C THE WOMEN wash clothes in the stream. Lilka is by the riverbank, scrubbing furiously. Tamara works beside her.

D: There was a man in a shop on Grudek street... and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes... Riva swoons. The women burst into ribald laughter. The SOUND of a horse. They look to the opposite bank where: TUVIA RIDES BY on his horse. Lilka can't help but stare.
C: BELLA
D: Doesn't take a fortune teller to know what Lilka's dreaming about... Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even louder.

N: 104C INTERCUT: A TREE LINE OVERLOOKING A MUDDY ROAD 104C Zus, Ben Zion and several BIELSKI FIGHTERS hide alongside TEN RUSSIAN PARTISANS as a GERMAN TROOP TRUCK approaches. Pachenko watches as Zus follows the approaching truck through binoculars, then cocks the heavy machine gun. The truck SLOWS TO A CRAWL as it encounters an overturned PEASANT CART blocking the road. 104D BACK TO THE WEDDING 104D As Asael kisses the bride, Tuvia is staring not at the newlyweds but rather at Lilka, who has washed and let down her hair. She glances up and meets his eye, then looks away. As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot: 104E ZUS OPENS FIRE. 104E The driver SLUMPS over the wheel and the truck careens lazily off the road. GERMAN SOLDIERS spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus's fighters SWARM down the hill. Several are HIT right away. 104F INTERCUT: THE GROWING ECSTASY OF THE WEDDING CELEBRATION 104F WITH THE FRENZY OF BATTLE. People dance and sing, their joy juxtaposed with the murderous intensity of the firefight, their twirling movements a cracked mirror of the death agonies of fighters of both sides as they are hit and fall. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 67B.

C: ZUS
D: Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I'LL SHOOT
N: YOU...
S: FROM A VANTAGE POINT IN THE ROCKS
N: Viktor watches, heartened by Zus' natural aggression. GERMAN SOLDIERS TAKE COVER behind the overturned truck effectively RETURNING FIRE. Several partisans are KILLED. ZUS PULLS A POTATO MASHER GRENADE from his belt and RUNS AT THE TRUCK in a mad headlong assault. ZUS (CONT'D)
C: ARRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
D: He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE THEIR HANDS. CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an arsenal of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting. Boots, coats, blankets, etc. Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners, kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks. Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after another. VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes.
C: VIKTOR
D: You are related to Bielski?
C: ZUS
D: I am a Bielski, too. Viktor looks at him appraisingly.

A driving wind. Bundled in scarves, overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from a line. In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket. Women and children stare blankly into space. Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes, BLACK with frostbite. Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it. 109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes.
C: ASAEL
D: There is talk of returning to the ghetto.
C: TUVIA
D: Madness.
C: ASAEL
D: They've barely eaten in days. Even when our food missions manage to get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers for a moment.
C: TUVIA
D: Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes.

C: SHULMAN
D: We mustn't have any tracks leading back to base. He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders.

D: Stay on this side of the creek until you reach the river then up the hill. I'll wait here for the others. She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow.

D: Shoo-- Shoo--
N: DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 74. 112A CONTINUED: (2) 112A But the dog, as ravenous as she, smells the food and won't back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at the mouth. Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its jaws. It's terrifying. She looks desperately for help. Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips a sack from her shoulder, knocking her down. Viciously it begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within. A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops. Lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets the weapon, picks up the sack of food, and starts off. Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto her shoulder, too. More food. 112B IN THE INFIRMARY 112B Riva bandages Edjelman's head. Tuvia looks at all the sick.
C: TUVIA
D: What's wrong with them all?
C: RIVA
D: If it's typhus we're in trouble. The lice are carriers.
C: ASAEL
D: The partisans have ampicillin. But they say they need it for themselves. In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared hands and arms -- like some kind of primitive huntress.
C: ASAEL
D: Tuvia...
E: CONT'D sees he is distracted
C: TUVIA
D: Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I'll go see Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after.

D: Are you all right?
E: CONT'D
C: LILKA

C: TUVIA
D: Zus... For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the police station, we HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history.

C: PANCHENKO
D: --and you are an ignorant Tartar. Ignore him. Here...
E: offers Zus vodka
C: ZUS
D: Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this?

D: He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew.
C: GRAMOV
D: I apologize, Jew.
C: PANCHENKO
D: There. You see? Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka.
E: ...a command
S: EXT. THE BIELSKI CAMP (TO ESTABLISH)
N: Guards ring the snowy perimeter. THE BLURRED IMAGE OF AN ANGEL FRAMED BY A HALO OF SUNLIGHT as it swims into focus. Tuvia opens his eyes. It is Lilka. She sits beside him, mopping his forehead with a cool rag.

E: looks at her
C: LILKA
D: I'm sorry.
C: TUVIA

C: TUVIA
D: I'd love to hear you play.
C: LILKA
D: You know Chopin?
C: TUVIA
D: Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok.

C: TUVIA
D: Thank you, Lilka.
C: OUTSIDE TUVIA'S BUNKER
D: THE LUBCZANSKI'S have taken the fullest advantage of Tuvia's illness. There are now TWO LINES of people waiting for food. The malbushim line up like prison inmates. Lazar looks into his bowl -- two beans floating in a scummy broth.
C: IN THE SHORTER LINE
D: Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine and a few others are enjoying real food. Lazar calls out from the other line.
N: DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 85.
C: LAZAR
D: Hey, Arkady This isn't soup, it's piss.
C: ARKADY
D: I will piss on your head and you will say it's raining. Eat it. The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs. TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN.
C: TUVIA
D: What happened? Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others. Tuvia strides over to them.
C: TUVIA
D: What is this?
E: CONT'D
C: ARKADY
D: New policy. Fighters get better food.
C: TUVIA
D: Against my orders...
C: ARKADY
D: You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment.
N: AND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST! He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those watching.
C: TUVIA
D: As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands.
N: THERE WILL BE NO MORE COMPLAINING! NO MORE SITTING! NO MORE DOING NOTHING. ANYONE WANTS TO LEAVE, THEY LEAVE. NOW! The rest work. Every morning we get up and we work. WE WORK. In the snow and the cold and the dark. Tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka, we double the number of food missions. ...We work. (looks down at Arkady) Take his body into the woods and leave it for the wolves. He turns and walks away. As he passes the food lines, people subtly move out of his way and whisper after he is gone.

C: TUVIA
D: Do you hear that?
C: IN THE WOMEN'S ZEMYLANKA
D: We HEAR the SOUND for what it is... The cry of a newborn. A baby boy in this mud manger. Riva and Lilka have assisted. Tamara holds her new baby to her breast. Suddenly -- the blanket serving as a door is SWEPT ASIDE. TUVIA stands there. Tamara cries out and shields the baby. Lilka springs up and pushes him back outside.

D: You must let it live!
C: TUVIA
D: I cannot keep the living alive. Tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate.
C: LILKA
D: She was raped by the Nazis. Tuvia closes his eyes. He is tired of being in charge, tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate.
C: LILKA
D: ...You tell us to hold onto our humanity. Not to become like animals. What better way than by bringing a life into this world of suffering and death. It's our only hope. Tuvia is undone by her intensity. The very nearness of her. The smell of her newly-washed hair. The glow of her skin. He looks at her. And nods in surrender.

D: Thank you, Tuvia. She kisses him. A chaste kiss of gratitude. She pulls back and they look into each other's eyes. The next kiss is something entirely different.

D: Justice... Soon it is a chant: "Justice! .Justice!" Tuvia looks at their faces. Only months ago they were decorous, civilized. Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous. Bella has been silently watching. She steps into the circle, looks down at the terrified German man.

Behind them, the group separates -- staring at the lifeless body on the ground. And then they look at each other, their blood lust sated, beginning to reckon with what they have done. What they have become. TUVIA STANDS ALONE IN THE FOREST, HIS FACE IN SHADOW He sees Aron, squatting beside a tree, crying silently. Tuvia kneels beside him, cradling him.

C: ZUS
D: He doesn't look good.
C: ASAEL
D: I could say the same about you. Where'd you get the jacket?
C: ZUS

TUVIA'S WORLD IS IN SLOW-MOTION Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers -- a surreal effect.

MEANWHILE -- THE ASSIGNED DEFENDERS, MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE take up their assigned positions: Levine mans the heavy machine gun behind a log; Lazar, Miriam and Rosa in the trees. Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children to disappear into the forest.

N: MIRIAM
C: GO!
D: Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the two men race for new positions. Then she is hit. She keeps firing anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is dying. More troops begin firing from their flank. Asael has no choice but to break off. They race into the woods.

D: Tuvia--? Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the line. The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They stare at one another, anxious and rudderless.
C: WOMAN
D: My father cannot make it.
E: ZOE

D: Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying.
N: MALBIN
C: TUVIA--
D: And still Tuvia is silent. More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising. Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat -- undone by the forced march.
C: MALBIN
D: What's wrong with him?

E: CONT'D
C: VOICE
D: Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands off a wounded comrade to Riva's care.

C: TAMARA
D: In there?
C: RONA
D: It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises his voice.
C: ASAEL
D: Nothing is impossible! What we have done is impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and again.
C: ASAEL
D: God will not part these waters. We will do it ourselves.
E: CONT'D
C: RONA

E: meeting Asael's eye
C: ONE MAN
D: Removes his belt and offers it to Asael.
N: ANOTHER STANDS, HOLDING HIS BELT And then another. One by one they offer them. There is something quietly heroic in the gesture. Tuvia looks at the group, looks away, fighting back emotion. SALMON Revision - 8-18-07 100D-100E. 162A THEY WADE IN, WAIST HIGH 162A People link arms and hold on for dear life yet still they flounder. A man goes under, is pulled up.

C: TUVIA
D: No tracks on land. Get back in. It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially when one is weak and malnourished.
N: 162C IN A DEEP BOG 162C The mud sticks to their clothes, faces. Soon they are indistinguishable from their surroundings. When one person sinks in the muck, it takes three to get him back on his feet. The column slows. Tuvia gestures for them to keep moving. They can't. Literally cannot. He begins to physically push them on. Sometimes harshly. Eventually they are moving again.
T: CUT TO:
C: A GHOSTLY LANDSCAPE
D: Gnarled bare trees shrouded in mist. They trudge forward, their expressions wan and empty. Tuvia find Malbin and pulls him aside.

Who knows...? 163A THE WATER IS ALMOST HEAD HIGH 163A Parents hoist children onto their shoulders, hold weapons overhead as they claw at tall reeds to propel themselves forward, step by tortuous step. SHIMON clings to a tree. His wracking cough is terrifying and he is deathly pale.
C: TUVIA
D: Come... Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no. He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward.
T: CUT TO:
N: CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 102. A SPIT OF LAND IN THE SWAMP - DUSK They rest, eat what little food is left. A litter carrying Shimon is deposited on dry ground. He is barely alive.

C: TUVIA
D: Take off your glasses. Reflections. Tuvia moves off to check on the others.
C: MALBIN
D: Shimon, listen to me, the physical plane is just an illusion. Only the spiritual plane is real.

C: TUVIA

T: CUT TO:
C: A FOREST CROSSROADS
D: Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them the rest of the Partisans are marching away. Zus and the Jewish fighters are on foot, awaiting orders.

C: ZUS
D: For how long? Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned.
C: PANCHENKO
D: Until you are ordered to withdraw.
C: ZUS
D: And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun.
C: PANCHENKO
D: Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline, if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats.
C: PANCHENKO
D: You have served us well, Comrade.
E: CONT'D
C: ZUS
D: I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his men take cover in the woods. In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus.
E: a wintry smile
C: LOVA
D: What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view.
C: LOVA
D: Tell me. Who are we doing this for? With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to his family's door. As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows louder.
E: CONT'D

N: GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 106-106A.
C: ON THE OPPOSITE BANK
D: Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there, freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering.
C: SHULMAN
D: What's next...Sinai? Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing. It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An overwhelming feeling of relief. They are safe. Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve. Shimon is asking for him. Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed. Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with?
C: SHIMON
D: .Tuvia...
E: a whisper
C: TUVIA
D: Right here. Shimon is at the end.
C: SHIMON
D: ...Something...to say...

C: TUVIA
D: Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children.
N: A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES behind the tank, using it as protection. Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep their heads below the embankment. BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water. But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade. TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades. He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank. Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the women alongside the men.
C: UP AHEAD
D: A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun.
N: GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 107A. Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect. But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take cover. Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the tank. It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is

N: DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 108. TUVIA IS NOW ISOLATED AND PINNED DOWN Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover. THE TURRET SWIVELS IN HIS DIRECTION It is only a matter of moments before he is dead. WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODS Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the run. Without regard for his own life, Zus charges. The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly. Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun from the open hatch. Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS. Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who is staring back at him. BOTH GROUPS MEET - THE DESTROYED TANK SMOLDERS NEARBY Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German assault machine gun.

C: ZUS
D: Perhaps you have room for one more?
N: DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 109. Tuvia reaches out his arms and they embrace fiercely. IN THE DEEP WOODS - LATER They walk in silence. Lilka comes to walk beside him, resting her head on his shoulder as they walk. Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its beauty for the first time. Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled.
C: TUVIA
D: Don't you hear it?
C: ZUS
D: What...?
C: TUVIA
D: Nothing. Isn't it beautiful? We HOLD on Tuvia. He has aged ten years in one.
N: PINK Revision - 7-18-07 110. But for now he allows himself a brief moment of satisfaction. We might even see the ghost of a smile. But it is short- lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern once again clouding his face. Another problem to attend to. And as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying to catch up with the others. As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness of the woods, these words appear on screen: THEY LIVED IN THE FOREST FOR TWO MORE YEARS. IN THEIR NEW CAMP THEY BUILT A SCHOOL, A HOSPITAL, A NURSERY. AND STILL MORE CAME TO FIND THEM. AT THE TIME OF LIBERATION, TWELVE HUNDRED WALKED OUT OF THE FOREST.
