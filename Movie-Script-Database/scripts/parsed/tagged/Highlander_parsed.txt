S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses, illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning against an alley wall. He is waiting. Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first. They size each other up as best they can.
C: FIRST MAN
D: MacLeod.
N: The second nods. The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash of metal severs the agressor's head.
S: INT. HUTCH - MORNING
N: A 15th century Scottish home. A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron, stands hunched over a glowing hearth. Her veined hands drag a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot of grey soup. From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters.
C: MOTHER
D: My, but are you the picture.
C: CONOR
D: It's a bit tight.
E: surveying himself
N: His FATHER enters with a pail of milk.
C: FATHER
D: Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
C: MOTHER
D: Have you time for some- thing to eat?
C: CONOR
D: No, Mother. They'll be here shortly.
N: Conor's father looks him over with pride.
C: FATHER
D: Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
C: MOTHER
D: Must he go?
C: FATHER
D: Aye. It is his duty. All of ours.
C: MOTHER
D: But Ian, he's still but a boy.
C: FATHER
D: He's a MacLeod.
C: CONOR
D: I'll be fine Mother.
S: EXT. HUTCH - MORNING
N: Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to the cottage door. Conor's father steps out to meet them.
S: EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING
N: A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling- ing to his helmet and breastplate. A CLANSMAN hikes up the heather-carpeted slope to him.
C: CLANSMAN
D: They march.
C: KNIGHT
D: Is the boy among them?
C: CLANSMAN
D: Aye.
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first. With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.
S: EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING
N: The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain. Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line. The low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards. There is an erie, smothering silence. VASSAL #1 Is a bad day for this. VASSAL #2 The Duke has been compro- mised. He will have his due. VASSAL #1 By day's end he will have our heads. VASSAL #2 We ride against the Suther- lands. That is all that matters. VASSAL #1 This makes no sense to me. CONOR And a friend are marching through the moist heather.
C: FRIEND
D: The fog is bad. We cannot even see the sides of our own ranks.
N: Conor's nervousness is showing.
C: FRIEND
D: Is this your first?
C: CONOR
D: Aye.
N: SHOUTING is heard on the plain.
C: FRIEND
D: It's begun.
S: EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING
N: The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below. He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.
S: EXT. PLAIN - MORNING
N: The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan and clashing swords. The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex- citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes. The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with his opponent. THE KNIGHT Rides calmly through the fracas. He strikes and kills those that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle. He is looking. CONOR Is standing above the twitching body of his friend. Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan. He stumbles through the fog, seeking help. Suddenly he is alone with the Knight. The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy. His fear turned to panic, Conor turns and flees. The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his horse into persuit. Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into the heather. As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in time to see the Knight dismount and start for him. THE KNIGHT Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the boy's. His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.
C: KNIGHT
D: There can be but one.
N: A CLANSMAN Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him nearly in half. ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate. The battle is shifting to where they are. Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail- ants. A VASSAL Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted Knight. VASSAL #1 Leave him! The clansmen obey. With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the Knight disappears into the fog. The Vassal surveys the carnage before him. His eyes fall a moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor. The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley. The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his sword into a near-by drain. He straightens up and waits. AN OFFICER Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward. His PARTNER switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley in a harsh glare. MAN IN ALLEY For the first time we can see his face. RICHARD TAUPIN, clad in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor. The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively for his pistol. He yells to his partner now coming into the alley. OFFICER #1 Kevin! Get is a backup.
C: TAUPIN
D: I was merely walking by when-
N: OFFICER #1 Don't move. The officer has his pistol out and leveled. His partner runs up, shotgun in hand. OFFICER #2 They're on their way. His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe. OFFICER #2 Christ.
S: INT. HUTCH - NIGHT
N: Conor lies moaning on a cot. Makeshift bandages wrap his body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood. The family surrounds their dying son. A PRIEST is delivering the last rites.
C: PRIEST
D: ...Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut libertasi David de manu regis Saul...
N: His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead.
C: PRIEST
D: ...In mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum...
S: EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT
N: A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway. VASSAL #1 Has the boy died?
C: CLANSMAN
D: He is having the last rites now. It should be over by morning.
N: VASSAL #1
T: Never seen anybody cut as
N: bad live so long. He should have died on the field.
C: CLANSMAN
D: Tonight or tomorrow, it's all the same.
N: The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the sacraments.
C: PRIEST
D: ...Auditorium nostrum in nomine domini...
N: VASSAL #1 This has been a dark day.
C: PRIEST
D: ...Requiescant in pace...
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: There is a bustle of activity. Setting up barricades, uni- formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious ONLOOKERS at a distance. DETECTIVE LT. MORAN Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him, is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER.
C: EXAMINER
D: Real clean. No sawing action at all. Whatever it was did it in one swipe. Like the other one.
E: studying body looks up at Moran
N: Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby.
C: MORAN
D: What about that?
C: EXAMINER
D: Hasn't any blood on it.
C: MORAN
D: About the only thing that doesn't.
E: looking around
C: EXAMINER
D: I'll give it a closer look when I get back.
N: BRENNA CARTWRIGHT Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of insolent intelligence. An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade. OFFICER #3 Come on Brenna, you know better than that.
C: BRENNA
D: I'm invited.
N: She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his equipment.
C: BRENNA
D: Mr. Levine...
E: greeting
N: The examiner turns and smiles.
C: EXAMINER
D: Hope this isn't past your bedtime.
N: Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from where the head should be.
C: BRENNA
D: Doesn't have a head, does he?
C: EXAMINER
D: This one came unassembled.
N: Lt. Moran is standing near.
C: MORAN
D: Just show her what she came for, Tom.
E: no warmth
C: EXAMINER
D: Come on, this is more your line of work.
E: stands, taps Brenna's arm
N: Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse to the sword.
C: EXAMINER
D: How's your uncle? I hardly ever see him anymore.
C: BRENNA
D: Fine.
N: The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in forensic plastic.
C: EXAMINER
D: There you go.
N: Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down beside it.
C: EXAMINER
D: Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
C: BRENNA
D: Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
E: looks up in Moran's direction
C: EXAMINER
D: Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
C: BRENNA
D: Claymore.
C: EXAMINER
D: Huh?
C: BRENNA
D: Scottish claymore. Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
C: EXAMINER
D: You're the expert.
C: BRENNA
D: It's in good condition.
E: runs hand along hilt, slightly confused
N: RICHARD TAUPIN Is being put in the rear of a patrol car. Brenna studies his face in the half-gloom. There's something different about him. A steadiness.
S: INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM
N: Richard Taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a room otherwise bare of furnishings. He seems unphased by his surroundings. The door opens and Moran enters with bag and notebook. He picks up Taupin's wallet on the table top and checks the driver's license.
C: MORAN
D: This your present address?
C: TAUPIN
D: Yes.
C: MORAN
D: Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
E: looks at license
C: TAUPIN
D: I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your men came right after.
C: MORAN
D: Did you know the victim?
C: TAUPIN
D: No.
C: MORAN
D: His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
C: TAUPIN
D: It doesn't.
C: MORAN
D: He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
N: Taupin's face is stoic and controlled.
C: MORAN
D: Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way. He'd also been in the country less than a week. What is your citizenship?
E: beat
C: TAUPIN
D: American.
N: Moran paces to a corner of the room.
C: MORAN
D: Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
C: TAUPIN
D: What are you getting at?
C: MORAN
D: Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
N: Moran places both hands on the table and leans across it.
C: MORAN
D: What were _you_ looking for?
C: TAUPIN
D: That's none of your business.
C: MORAN
D: You're wrong.
N: Moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large broad sword; old, but in mint condition.
C: MORAN
D: Do you know what this is?
C: TAUPIN
D: I presume it's a sword.
C: MORAN
D: A claymore to be exact. You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
C: TAUPIN
D: Your murder weapon?
C: MORAN
D: It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
C: TAUPIN
D: A mystery.
C: MORAN
D: For the moment.
N: Moran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down. He rises and opens the door.
C: MORAN
D: All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in touch.
N: Taupin passes through the doorway without comment.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Taupin out into the crisp night air. His eyes search out the darkness.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CONOR'S FAMILY HUTCH - DAY
N: A medieval sun beats down on an OLD TRAVELER making his way up the MacLeod home. Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a bucket, smiles in recognition.
C: MOTHER
D: Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
C: TRAVELLER
D: I only just heard of Conor. I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
C: MOTHER
D: You're a kind man to be sure.
C: TRAVELLER
D: I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
C: MOTHER
D: Steven, Conor didn't die.
C: TRAVELLER
D: But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
C: MOTHER
D: They were Steven, they were. It's been a miracle it has. He lasted right through and healed. No one in the village has ever seen anything like it. Ever.
S: EXT. MEADOW - DAY
N: Perched on a heather-carpeted rise above the village a young woman, MARA, sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil. Balancing on a shepard's staff, Conor limps over and puts his lips to her ear.
C: CONOR
D: You're pretty today.
N: Mara is silent. Distant.
C: CONOR
D: I'm your future husband, remember?
C: MARA
D: I have no future husband.
C: CONOR
D: I don't understand. Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
N: This is difficult for her. Tears well in her eyes.
C: MARA
D: My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
C: CONOR
D: What are you saying? I'm standing here as real as you.
C: MARA
D: You cannot be real, Conor. You had the last rites. No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
C: CONOR
D: But I did live.
C: MARA
D: Live? In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
C: CONOR
D: So why the crazy talk? It's a miracle it is. Saint Andrew has smiled on me. On us.
C: MARA
D: Some think not.
C: CONOR
D: Who?
C: MARA
D: There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
C: CONOR
D: That's mad. Surely you don't take their word?
C: MARA
D: I don't know, Conor. It's not natural. Maybe something has touched you.
C: CONOR
D: You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
C: MARA
D: Me father has taken back my hand.
N: He puts a hand to her cheek.
C: CONOR
D: Ah, Lassie...
N: She steps back.
C: MARA
D: Please not be touching me, Conor.
C: CONOR
D: I'll not take that kind of talk from you. From those others below, maybe. But not from you.
C: MARA
D: Leave me alone, Conor. Please.
C: CONOR
D: You're not talking sense, Mara!
N: Anger tumbles into exasperation. CONOR I'm sorry. He steps for her. She moves away. Conor's face hardens with resentment.
C: CONOR
D: If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
C: MARA
D: Do what you must.
E: crying
N: Resigned, Conor turns and limps away.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - DAY
N: Classy antiques. Unusual. Clocks, tables, chests. Small and personal. Richard Taupin enters and sheds his overcoat.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Mrs. Thompson agreed to settle for fifteen, Melvin's wants to make a pick-up at three o'clock, the coffee machine's broken, and there's a Miss Cartwright from the Smithsonian in your office.
N: Taupin is hardly in the mood.
S: INT. TAUPIN'S OFFICE
N: Brenna Cartwright stands in Taupin's cluttered surroundings admiring a bagpipe set neatly on a shelf.
C: BRENNA
D: Do you play?
C: TAUPIN
D: Yes.
C: BRENNA
D: Very traditional.
N: Taupin sits down and begins sorting through a stack of papers on his desk.
C: TAUPIN
D: Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
E: impatient
C: BRENNA
D: I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
C: TAUPIN
D: It's not mine.
C: BRENNA
D: It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
C: TAUPIN
D: Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with. Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
N: Brenna has taken a carving from the shelf.
C: BRENNA
D: Byzantine?
C: TAUPIN
D: Basil the II.
C: BRENNA
D: Charming guy, Basil. Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
C: TAUPIN
D: -All but one out of a hundred, I know. All left to be led like donkeys back home. Now if you will please-
N: Brenna suddenly tosses the carving at him. Taupin snatches it out of the air with lightning precision.
C: BRENNA
D: Good reflexes.
C: TAUPIN
D: Good day, Miss Cartwright.
S: INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM DEPARTMENT OFFICE
N: A lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken study tables. The department SUPERVISOR sits at his desk surrounded by a handful of his staff RESEARCHERS - Brenna included. A faded, stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches.
C: BRENNA
D: I don't believe him.
C: SUPERVISOR
D: Why?
C: BRENNA
D: He's too cool. Too sharp. I think he's got something to do with it.
N: RESEARCHER #1 Oh, has your penetrating research on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the criminal mentality?
C: BRENNA
D: Screw off, Larry.
N: The men, LAUGH. They delight in baiting her. Researcher #2 opens a Budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval mug he's borrowed from the collection. RESEARCHER #2 The cops bought it. They let him go.
C: BRENNA
D: What could they hold him for? I think they're just waiting for something concrete before they haul him in for real. We should look into it. He had to have gotten that sword from somewhere.
C: SUPERVISOR
D: Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
C: BRENNA
D: I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved. It's just a hunk of peasant iron. Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
N: RESEARCHER #1 Here we go. Everytime there's a murder in town we have to put up with junior D.A. RESEARCHER #2 Must be genetic.
C: BRENNA
D: Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over. He has one, he might have two.
C: SUPERVISOR
D: You see that desk? _Your_ desk? You see the crap piled up on it?
C: BRENNA
D: Give it a rest Ned, huh?
N: RESEARCHER #2 Might be interesting to see what his family connections are. That's a hell of a piece to be just chuck- ing around in an alley.
C: SUPERVISOR
D: I swear to God Brenna, between you and Thompson's novels I'm going to get a bloody ulcer.
E: sighs
N: Researcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TAVERN
N: An empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking establishment. CLANSMEN, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow VILLAGERS. No longer requiring the use of a cane, Conor enters.
C: CONOR
D: Evening, Douglas.
E: to owner
C: DOUGLAS
D: Conor.
N: The tavern goes silent. Wary. The attention is on Conor.
C: CONOR
D: Ale suits me.
N: The owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug. Conor takes it and walks to where four other VILLAGERS sit. TAVERN MAN #1 We rather you not be sitting with us, Conor. Conor looks to the next table. TAVERN MAN #2 We be drinking alone as well. The entire tavern spells the same sentiments.
C: CONOR
D: What's wrong with you all?
N: Silence. Angered, Conor approaches the second man. As he looms above his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts it forward. TAVERN MAN #2 Requiem acer'nam donaei-
C: CONOR
D: What are you doing man?
N: TAVERN MAN #2 -Et lux perpetua-
C: CONOR
D: You'll not be bringing the church into this.
N: TAVERN MAN #2 -Luceat ei- The weird display frightens Conor.
C: CONOR
D: Be quiet.
N: TAVERN MAN #2 -Auditorium nostrum-
C: CONOR
D: Stop.
N: TAVERN MAN #2 -In nomine sanctus esperitu-
C: CONOR
D: Stop!
N: Conor HURLES his mug against the wall. His nerves shattered, he rushes out.
S: INT. MACLEOD HUTCH
N: Conor packs a satchel with his few clothes and belongings. He walks to the doorway where his mother and father wait. His mother, tears on her cheek, hugs him tightly.
C: MOTHER
D: Please take care of yourself.
C: CONOR
D: Aye.
N: Conor turns to his father.
C: FATHER
D: I wish there was some other way.
N: They clasp hands.
C: FATHER
D: Goodbye, Conor.
C: CONOR
D: Goodbye.
N: Without looking back he passes through the doorway and down the empty path, his figure quickly fading in the moorish fog.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT
N: The NOISY business-as-usual confusion at the Washington P.D. processing center. Amongst the dinge of CLANGING phones and CLACKING typewriters, a uniformed OFFICER enters something into a computer terminal. Brenna sits perched on a desk nearby.
C: DESK OFFICER
D: This is against the rules.
C: BRENNA
D: So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
C: DESK OFFICER
D: -Okay okay.
C: BRENNA
D: You owe me. Besides, I'm cute.
N: The computer returns a reply onto a printer.
C: DESK OFFICER
D: Taupin, Richard Marshall. Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland. Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
E: tears off sheet
C: BRENNA
D: Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
C: DESK OFFICER
D: Anything in Maryland is close.
S: EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY
N: Taupin steps out of a Metro station and walks the few blocks to his brick townhouse. Climbing the front stairs, he fishes his keys out of a coat pocket. About to insert the key he stops, sensing something. Backing down the steps, Taupin slips around to the rear of the building.
S: INT. TAUPIN HOME
N: Like a spider Taupin pries open a window and slips silently inside. The home is dark and still. Taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway. There a MAN, dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible in the dim light, is crouched at the front door. He is holding a sword. Taupin removes a knife from his pocket and JUMPS the intruder. The two STRUGGLE fiercely. Taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his knife firmly against the man's throat.
C: TAUPIN
D: Where is he?
N: Bulging eyes stare at him.
C: TAUPIN
D: Where!
C: INTRUDER
D: I don't know.
C: TAUPIN
D: What name is he using?
N: Taupin presses the blade. A trickle of blood rolls down the throat.
C: INTRUDER
D: Smith. Carl Smith.
C: TAUPIN
D: How many came?
C: INTRUDER
D: The last four.
C: TAUPIN
D: And the Bulgarian?
C: INTRUDER
D: He got him. He always does. Eventually.
E: hoarse chuckle
C: TAUPIN
D: He knows I'm here. How?
C: INTRUDER
D: None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
N: The knife is pressed deeper.
C: TAUPIN
D: _Answer_ me.
C: INTRUDER
D: We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York. Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
E: gasping
S: EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY
N: A city limit sign announcing the small community of Church Hill is overtaken by Brenna's sedan.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY
N: Brenna looks through a telephone book.
C: BRENNA
D: Taupin...Taupin...
N: Nothing. She closes the book and drums her fingers on the cover.
S: EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
N: An 1860s stone columned affair, far more impressive than the low-lying town that surrounds it. Brenna enters.
S: INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE
N: Brenna sits sifting through a large cloth-bound book entitled _Certificates of Birth: 1941-1948_.
C: BRENNA
D: Tarmin...Tatum...Taupin, Richard Marshall. Born to William and Karen Taupin, no address. Attend- ing physician, Dr. Willis Kidell.
E: reading
S: INT. DR. KIDELL'S HOME
N: Dr. Kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder.
C: KIDELL
D: 1945, that strains the memory. Here we are, Richard Taupin.
E: after a fashion
N: He carries the binder to the table where Brenna sits.
C: KIDELL
D: Would you like more tea?
C: BRENNA
D: No thank you, I'm fine.
N: Kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page.
C: KIDELL
D: He was unsual.
C: BRENNA
D: Why?
C: KIDELL
D: Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then. Most all the babies I delivered were from local families. Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came. I did it right here at the house.
C: BRENNA
D: Then you didn't know Richard later on.
C: KIDELL
D: No.
C: BRENNA
D: I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
C: KIDELL
D: Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
C: BRENNA
D: I don't follow you.
C: KIDELL
D: Poor little tyke didn't have a chance. Hopelessly premature. He died a few days after he was born.
C: BRENNA
D: The boy _died_?
C: KIDELL
D: Mother too. Sad case it was. The young lady just couldn't make it through labor. Never even saw her son.
N: Dr. Kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping.
C: KIDELL
D: My brother worked for the town paper at the time. He took this picture of the funeral.
N: Something in the clipping sparks Brenna's interest.
C: BRENNA
D: Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
C: KIDELL
D: There was this one fella. Asked a lot of questions. I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
C: BRENNA
D: Would you remember his name?
C: KIDELL
D: Carl Smith.
E: thinks
S: INT. POLICE STATION
N: A police line-up. Seven MEN, all dressed in Santa Claus outfits with bare legs, are paraded for a small, old LADY.
C: OFFICER
D: Just tell us when you see the one.
N: Several rows back in the dark sits Brenna's UNCLE JOE, the district attorney, and another man, his ASSISTANT.
C: UNCLE JOE
D: Forget it.
C: BRENNA
D: I'm just curious.
C: UNCLE JOE
D: You're never "just curious". You've met my neice, Brenna.
E: to assistant
C: ASSISTANT
D: Hi Brenna.
C: OFFICER
D: Number 5, lift your coat up more.
E: to line-up
C: UNCLE JOE
D: Aren't you getting a little old for this? You flunked out of law school.
C: BRENNA
D: Now there's a new topic.
E: rolls her eyes
C: UNCLE JOE
D: Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
N: Brenna puts on her best little-girl angelic smile, a smile her uncle can never refuse.
C: UNCLE JOE
D: Forgers do it all the time. They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D. Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
E: sighs
C: BRENNA
D: Thanks.
C: UNCLE JOE
D: Call your mother. You never call her.
C: OFFICER
D: Well?
E: to old lady
C: OLD LADY
D: I don't know. I'd have to see his thing.
S: INT. BRENNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A swath of moonlight shines in across a carafe-turned-vase, a New England college diploma, and a police uniform hanging from the bedpost where Brenna lies with another man, DENNIS.
C: BRENNA
D: I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967. And the guys rich. You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
C: DENNIS
D: Maybe he's hiding from something.
C: BRENNA
D: Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill. I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank. So he isn't a cop. District anyway.
N: Dennis gets out of bed and begins putting on his uniform.
C: DENNIS
D: Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
C: BRENNA
D: Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral. The father looked just like Richard. Even had a mark on his cheek.
C: DENNIS
D: How old is Richard?
C: BRENNA
D: P.D. says 41, but he barely looks
C: DENNIS
D: Find the father. That should clear things up.
N: He buttons his shirt. Something occurs to him.
C: DENNIS
D: Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
C: BRENNA
D: Yeah.
C: DENNIS
D: He'd want to know about all this.
C: BRENNA
D: Mr. Congeniality? Let him find his own clues. There's a journal article in this somewhere.
C: DENNIS
D: Uncle Joey's little girl. Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
E: shakes head
N: Dennis puts on his police cap.
C: DENNIS
D: Well, the cream of society awaits. If you're ever in the neighborhood...
E: cocks hat to one side
C: BRENNA
D: Sure.
S: EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT - NIGHT
N: POLICE OFFICERS, their flashlights cutting the darkness, search the mud shores of a Potomac tidal basin. The glowing Jefferson Memorial can be seen in the distance. DETECTIVE MORAN Is supervising. An OFFICER climbs up the embankment to him.
C: OFFICER
D: They found it.
N: The officer leads him down to the river where a headless BODY wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag.
C: OFFICER
D: It was about fifty yards down- stream from the head.
N: Moran looks down at the body bag, its dark plastic reflecting the rythmic rotation of squad car beacons.
C: OFFICER
D: Both were cut real clean. Like the other ones...
S: EXT. EQUESTRIAN RIDING GROUNDS - DAY
N: A steeple-chase course lies shrouded in an Arlington fog. Across the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle. Driving the steed hard through the course, Taupin pulls firm on the reins, bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective Moran waits.
C: MORAN
D: There's been another murder.
N: Taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline.
C: TAUPIN
D: My condolences.
C: MORAN
D: Where were you Tuesday night?
C: TAUPIN
D: Home.
C: MORAN
D: A neighbor saw your car leave.
C: TAUPIN
D: He's mistaken.
N: Taupin climbs down from his horse. Moran moves close.
C: MORAN
D: Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
C: TAUPIN
D: Do you?
C: MORAN
D: All I need is time.
C: TAUPIN
D: I've got all the time in the world. Except right now. If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
E: looks at watch
N: In no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away.
S: INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT
N: Brenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her desk corner. Boring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs. From another folder she pulls out a computer sheet. INSERT COMPUTER SHEET The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record. Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and driving records. Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in Brenna looks down the list to a WILLIAM TAUPIN of Felton, Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the year Richard started.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
N: Dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, Brenna removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware.
S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
N: Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary. Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants. On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an open grave. Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit. A coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: "WILLIAM MICHAEL TAUPIN". The casket is empty.
C: BRENNA
D: Someone beat you.
C: TAUPIN
D: Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
C: BRENNA
D: Grave robbers?
C: TAUPIN
D: Probably.
C: BRENNA
D: Who?
C: TAUPIN
D: People like that rarely leave business cards.
C: BRENNA
D: Does Carl Smith?
N: A flash of interest, quickly suppressed.
C: TAUPIN
D: I don't know what you're talking about.
C: BRENNA
D: I think you do. Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
C: TAUPIN
D: You have an active imagination.
C: BRENNA
D: I've been to Church Hill.
C: TAUPIN
D: Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you. I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
N: He starts for the gate.
C: BRENNA
D: I could find him.
N: Taupin stops.
C: BRENNA
D: I have friends.
C: TAUPIN
D: I doubt that. Good day, Miss Cartwright.
E: beat
N: He walks on. After only a few paces Taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt stop.
C: BRENNA
D: What's wrong?
N: He holds up an open palm to silence her.
C: TAUPIN
D: Your help may be unneccessary.
N: The air is still. Taupin's face is expressionless. He listens intently. Sensing. An unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind.
C: VOICE
D: Good afternoon, "Mr. Taupin".
E: o.s.
N: Taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad sword in hand. We have never seen the knight out of his armor before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill. Wearing Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone. Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a marble wall.
C: KNIGHT
D: Long time.
C: TAUPIN
D: Not so long.
N: The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.
C: TAUPIN
D: You've been here from the start.
C: KNIGHT
D: My quarry grows clever with age. And the others, incompetent.
N: The Knight throws Brenna a glance.
C: KNIGHT
D: Friend of yours?
C: TAUPIN
D: Of sorts.
C: KNIGHT
D: I do hope she enjoys a good show.
N: The Knight leans his whole body into a two-fisted swing, clanging out a chunk of marble as Taupin ducks. A second swipe also imbeds itself in stone.
C: KNIGHT
D: So now it ends.
T: A thrust cuts only air.
C: KNIGHT
D: Generation upon generation. Tens of thousands of miles.
N: Taupin leaps behind a tree. The Knight cuts it nearly in half.
C: KNIGHT
D: You're the last, MacLeod. Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich, those fools that followed me, their heads all line my shelf. All but yours.
N: Taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe.
C: KNIGHT
D: Can you feel it, MacLeod? Can you _feel_ it!
N: Taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the Knight on the knee, knocking him over. The Knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from Taupin.
C: KNIGHT
D: There can be but one.
N: He raises his blade. An elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in the clearing.
C: WATCHMAN
D: Hey! What's going on here?
N: The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest. Taupin pushes past him to Brenna.
C: TAUPIN
D: Run!
N: Brenna is frozen in shock. Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate.
C: TAUPIN
D: Run!
C: KNIGHT
D: MACLEOD!
N: The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and lumbers after them. Taupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround- ing residential area.
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
N: Taupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side- walk. They have apparently lost the Knight. Taupin pauses at a corner. He sees a church across the street.
S: INT. CHURCH
N: Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing echoing off the high ceiling. Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone. Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit- uation. Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and head against the back of the pew.
C: BRENNA
D: Jesus Christ.
C: TAUPIN
D: You'll be safe here. He won't kill in a church.
C: BRENNA
D: Why not?
C: TAUPIN
D: Tradition.
E: distracted
C: BRENNA
D: What the hell is going on?
N: Taupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on his face. He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the Church's doorway without a word.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. MEDIEVAL BLACKSMITH SHOP
N: A glowing horseshoe HISSES wildly as it slips into a wooden cooling bucket. Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet. Sweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine.
S: EXT. SHOP FRONTAGE - DAY
N: Conor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms, cleaning off a day's worth of sweat and grime. JUAN ROMIREZ Stirring up dust with his travelling boots, this Spanish acc- ented man stops at Conor's shop. He wears a large broad sword strapped to his waist.
C: CONOR
D: Afternoon.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Your name is Conor?
C: CONOR
D: Aye.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Juan Cid Romirez. Chief surveyor and alchemist.
E: bows slightly
C: CONOR
D: You're not from these parts.
E: notices accent
C: ROMIREZ
D: I am from Spain. And I would like a moment of your time.
S: INT. CONOR'S HOME
N: Romirez is seated at a table. His back to the Spaniard, Conor is preparing some food.
C: CONOR
D: I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Please go to no trouble.
N: Romirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
C: CONOR
D: Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Your marks would suggest great injury.
C: CONOR
D: I was nearly killed.
C: ROMIREZ
D: But you lived.
N: Conor looks up from his work in pained memory.
C: CONOR
D: I did at that.
C: ROMIREZ
D: And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
C: CONOR
D: Aye.
C: ROMIREZ
D: I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation. And a solution.
N: Something isn't right. Conor turns and faces him.
C: CONOR
D: I was driven out.
C: ROMIREZ
D: And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
C: CONOR
D: How can you know this?
C: ROMIREZ
D: First food, no? A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
E: tone lightens
N: Stunned with the implications of what Romirez has said, like a robot Conor serves the meal. His eyes never leave Romirez, who digs hungrily into the food.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Hmm, que rico. What is it you call this?
C: CONOR
D: Pheasant.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You Scots have a way with game. It still has life in it. Spirit. Back home the food is so...domestic.
C: CONOR
D: Why are you here?
C: ROMIREZ
D: I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
C: CONOR
D: You're a long way from Inverness.
C: ROMIREZ
D: In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
C: CONOR
D: You know me home. Me name.
C: ROMIREZ
D: It was time for our paths to cross.
N: Romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You see this?
N: He traces some discoloration on his arm.
C: ROMIREZ
D: When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me. All thought I would die or be maimed for life. But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
C: CONOR
D: You are the same?
C: ROMIREZ
D: Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
C: CONOR
D: Yes. Always.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Does it change with me in the room?
C: CONOR
D: It is less.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You feel you know me.
C: CONOR
D: I don't know why.
C: ROMIREZ
D: We are brothers.
S: 42 EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
N: Romirez and Conor walk alone amongst torch-lit hutches.
C: CONOR
D: He told me there could be only one.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game. You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us. You know this, you can feel it. We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure, permanently.
E: Conor confused looks away
C: CONOR
D: I don't understand.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You are still so very young.
C: CONOR
D: I'm twenty-two.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Not even a single lifetime.
E: shakes head
N: Romirez chooses his words very carefully.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
C: CONOR
D: What?
C: ROMIREZ
D: We are immortal.
N: Stunned, Conor backs away from Romirez.
C: CONOR
D: No, that can't be.
N: Romirez grasps Conor's shoulder.
C: ROMIREZ
D: It is as you are.
C: CONOR
D: No!
E: pushes away
N: This is all too much for Conor.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Listen to me. Hear the words.
C: CONOR
D: This is madness!
C: ROMIREZ
D: It is the truth.
C: CONOR
D: No!
N: Romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's heart. The boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his eyes roll up into his head. A shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the ground.

N: Brenna lowers herself wearily into a chair, rubs her eyes, and stares absently out the window. Reaching across to an end table, she plays back her answering machine. Beep.

D: This is Dr. Wickland at GWU. Your test came back today. You can call me here at the med center if you have any questions.
N: Click. Beep.

S: 45. INT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY 45
N: This HISS of Brenna's answering machine becomes the HISS of cooking. Bandaged about the chest, Conor asleep on his cot. Suddenly he sits up. Sweating. He looks about the room in confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
C: CONOR
D: This can't be.
E: dazed

C: ROMIREZ
D: You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
C: CONOR
D: Aye.
C: ROMIREZ
D: It is always less with my living. Far or near. But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before. There is power in this. And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
C: CONOR
D: But we cannot be killed.
C: ROMIREZ
D: There is an imperfection. For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat. Then it is over. The end.
C: CONOR
D: How can I stop such a man?
C: ROMIREZ
D: Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn. You must learn to defend yourself. In this I can help.

C: MR. NORTH
D: When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
C: TAUPIN
D: The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
C: MR. NORTH
D: Oh yes, more than enough.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE
N: Furniture clad in white sheets. Dust everywhere.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Most of the furniture was put into protective storage. I'll have some boys come up and clean the place out for you.

C: MR. NORTH
D: You're one of William's kids, huh?
E: fascinated
C: TAUPIN
D: His only kid.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Sure take after him. Never seen a father and son look more alike.

D: I'll send them right up.
S: INT. "O'REILY'S" - NIGHT
N: Coupled strangers gyrate under colored lights and recorded music. Brenna sits alone. Whatever nervousness she brought through the door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by the three empty glasses in front of her. A MAN With something less than perfect coordination, sits down beside her.
C: MAN
D: That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
C: BRENNA
D: There was a Count. Count Dusan. He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it. The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
E: smiles
C: MAN
D: You're very macabre.
C: BRENNA
D: It's my birthday.

S: INT. PUB - NIGHT
N: A small neighborhood tavern. Regulars chat amicably with the BARTENDER-OWNER. TAUPIN Sits alone at a corner table. A WAITRESS hovers over him.
C: TAUPIN
D: Lager and lime.
N: LATER Taupin's lager is drained. Lost in thought, he drags a finger around and around the lip of the mug. He hand stops. It twitches. Shakes. Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly out of control. A warning. He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing over him.
C: KAHN
D: MacLeod.
N: Taupin is anxious, poised for attack. Kahn breaks into a broad smile.
C: KAHN
D: Spare a chair?
C: TAUPIN
D: Kahn?
C: KAHN
D: Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
C: TAUPIN
D: Sit.
N: Kahn takes his place across the table.

E: unsure
C: KAHN
D: Head still secure to the neck.

D: How did you find me?
C: KAHN
D: How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
N: Taupin looks to his own glass.

E: to waitress beat
C: TAUPIN
D: What are you doing here?
C: KAHN
D: It is the gathering, my friend. The settling of old scores.
N: Taupin tenses.
C: TAUPIN
D: And have you something to settle with me?
C: KAHN
D: Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
E: smiles
C: TAUPIN
D: It's good to see you, Kahn.
N: The waitress sets down two glasses.

E: raises glass
N: Kahn drains his glass.
C: KAHN
D: Waitress!
S: EXT. THE WASHINGTON MALL - NIGHT
N: Kahn and Taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed government building.
C: KAHN
D: I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
C: TAUPIN
D: Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
C: KAHN
D: But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on. And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
C: TAUPIN
D: Offered the Pope one of his whores.
N: They LAUGH. A JOGGER stops on the gravel and listens to the strange conversation.
C: TAUPIN
D: Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
C: KAHN
D: Good times then. A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears. Not like now.
E: sighs

D: He found us even there.
E: serious

N: A CLINKING of chain link as Taupin and Kahn climb a fence and tumble into the Washington Zoo.
C: TAUPIN
D: I haven't drunk this much since-
C: KAHN
D: -Since you last saw me.
N: Kahn chucks an empty wine bottle. An unspecified animal GROWLS sleepily somewhere in the darkness.
C: KAHN
D: Come on.
S: EXT. DISPLAY AREA - NIGHT
N: Taupin and Kahn stumble through an open-air display of Asian animals. Their VOICES seem to echo everywhere.
C: KAHN
D: I love zoos. Ever since I was a kid.
C: TAUPIN
D: You were never a kid.
N: Kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen.
C: KAHN
D: I knew his great-grandfather.
E: points at one
C: TAUPIN
D: You're insane.
C: KAHN
D: No, seriously. We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
C: TAUPIN
D: How do you do it, Kahn? How do you live so full of life for so long?
C: KAHN
D: Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have. All else is just marking time. You're marking time.
E: beat
C: TAUPIN
D: I've had a few more concerns.
N: Kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath.
C: KAHN
D: The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.

D: You're wrong.
C: KAHN
D: You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
S: INT. O'REILY'S - NIGHT
N: Late. The bar is nearly empty. No sign of the Knight. Brenna looks at her watch, sighs, and drops a bill onto the counter.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit street. She hears something and turns. -Nothing. A breeze rustles the trees above. After only a few more paces she hears something again. Brenna abruptly turns. -Right into the face of THE KNIGHT. Brenna SCREAMS. The Knight reaches into his leather carrying bag. A GROUP OF NOISY TEENAGERS Exit a facing townhouse. The Knight removes his hand from the bag as they spill onto the sidewalk LAUGHING and YELLING. Brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner. The Knight follows at a measured distance. At the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off. Brenna bolts into the intersection. Weaving through SCREECHING brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors.
S: INT. BUILDING
N: 40 well dressed PATRONS, numbered cards pinned to their lapels, sit in velvetly plush surroundings. At the front of the room stands a thin moustached art AUCTIONEER. Brenna BUSTLES in from outside.
C: AUCTIONEER
D: I apoligize for the lateness of the hour, but I'm sure you will all agree the quality of this year's collection is well worth the time.
N: The Knight BURSTS in with his leather carrying bag. Brenna slides along the draped back wall to avoid him.
C: AUCTIONEER
D: For this fine example of medieval religious art, let us open the bid at 4,000 dollars.
E: holding statuette
N: The Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry.
C: AUCTIONEER
D: 10,500 once, 10,500 twice...
N: Brenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a SECURITY GUARD..
C: AUCTIONEER
D: 11,000. A bid at 11,000.
E: points at Brenna
C: BRENNA
D: No, I-
N: The guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her very officially. Being closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across the room to a fire exit, setting off an ALARM as she flies open the door. The Knight leaps after her, knocking over an OLD WOMAN in the front row.
S: EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Brenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a Metro station.

N: Brenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car just as the doors shut. THE KNIGHT is also now on the platform but can only watch Brenna through a window as the train pulls away.
S: EXT. TAUPIN'S TOWNHOUSE - DAY
N: Brenna KNOCKS at the front door. No answer. She KNOCKS harder. The unlatched door pushes open.
S: INT. TOWNHOUSE
N: Brenna stands in the doorway. Before her is a disaster. Furniture has been smashed like matchsticks. A desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on the floor. Brenna enters slowly.
C: BRENNA
D: Mr. Taupin? I have to talk to you.
N: Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken. Brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers. She comes across an old black and white photograph. Badly streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm- house. Written in the corner is "Worstick, 1928". Brenna slips the photo into her pocket. Standing, she turns smack into Taupin.
C: TAUPIN
D: Finished?
N: He looks past her to the destruction of his living room. It doesn't seem to surprise him.
C: BRENNA
D: He tried to kill me last night.
C: TAUPIN
D: Where?
C: BRENNA
D: Dupont Circle.
N: Taupin sifts through the debris, selecting articles from it.
C: BRENNA
D: Who is he?
C: TAUPIN
D: At the moment? Carl Smith.
C: BRENNA
D: And you?
N: He ignores the question.
C: BRENNA
D: What will you do now?
C: TAUPIN
D: You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
C: BRENNA
D: He called you "MacLeod".
C: TAUPIN
D: Not your concern.
C: BRENNA
D: I left a man dead in Felton. But you don't really care, do you?
C: TAUPIN
D: That bothers you?
C: BRENNA
D: He was innocent.
C: TAUPIN
D: He's dead. Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
C: BRENNA
D: What about me?
C: TAUPIN
D: You?
C: BRENNA
D: I'm a witness to a murder. That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
C: TAUPIN
D: Have you gone to the police?
C: BRENNA
D: No.
C: TAUPIN
D: Why not? I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
C: BRENNA
D: I'd rather hear yours.
C: TAUPIN
D: You are being foolish.
E: beat
C: BRENNA
D: I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
C: TAUPIN
D: Go home.
N: He walks to the doorway.
C: BRENNA
D: Why does he want to kill you?
N: Taupin stops, his back to her.
C: TAUPIN
D: He sees me as a threat.
C: BRENNA
D: Are you?
N: Taupin walks out the door.

S: EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - DAY
N: On a clear rise above the village Romirez and Conor spar with swords covered in heavy cloth. Conor is having difficulty.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Concentrate!
N: Conor thrusts. Romirez blocks.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Harder. Concentrate harder.
C: CONOR
D: Me arm hurts.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Again. Try again.
N: Conor strikes. Romirez easily blocks.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Harder! You swing like an impotent cow!
C: CONOR
D: Go to hell.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
N: Ticked off, Conor leans himself into a two-fisted swing. Romirez knocks it aside, but Conor recovers faster than he, knocking Romirez flat on his back.
C: CONOR
D: Impotent cow.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Muy Bien!
N: Conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face. Romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled from his belt. He offers it to Conor.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Here my boy, from vineyards as sweet and smooth as a young girl's thigh.
N: Conor accepts the cup. Romirez pulls himself to his feet.
C: ROMIREZ
D: It will take less effort as you learn.
C: CONOR
D: It's like to kill me first.
N: Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You have a gift. One you must protect.
C: CONOR
D: And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
C: ROMIREZ
D: The Fabric of life. The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
C: CONOR
D: If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
E: shakes head
N: Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Come. Enough sword play for an afternoon.
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: A friendly horse race. Their reflections bouncing off a clear glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen tree trunks. Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait for Romirez, several lengths behind.
C: CONOR
D: You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez. We're raised as riders.
E: as Romirez rides up
C: ROMIREZ
D: Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
N: Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view. Romirez pulls a leaf from a tree and studies it closely.
C: CONOR
D: What is the fascinatioon? It is only a leaf.
C: ROMIREZ
D: All living things pay dues, Conor. They must be respected for that.
N: He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one.
C: ROMIREZ
D: As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes. To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
C: CONOR
D: I do not think I like the sound of that.
C: ROMIREZ
D: It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds. But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength. The strength of _knowledge_. The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
C: CONOR
D: I feel hardly nothing.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You have not been fully trained. But you will learn. And you will be good, I can feel that. You have apt- itude. This is why our friend is so concerned.
C: CONOR
D: But why be so concerned about me?
C: ROMIREZ
D: This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal. Some, like you and he, have more. Much more.
C: CONOR
D: And you?
C: ROMIREZ
D: I am a small player. But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
C: CONOR
D: I am not ready for this.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You must be. You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules. You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you. You will always know when you are in the presence of another. Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time. In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat. People will become a transitory, pathetic lot. The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent. But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all. That is how the others exist. Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last. Keep your soul sewed to the earth. Do not become one of them.
C: CONOR
D: Of course.
C: ROMIREZ
D: You are young, inexperienced. You do not know what time can do. How it can sap all pity, all love.
C: CONOR
D: That is not me.
C: ROMIREZ
D: With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
C: VILLAGER
D: Conor!
N: A VILLAGER approaches from across the pasture.
C: CONOR
D: Yes, Darin.
C: VILLAGER
D: Hate to be bothering you like this, but me mare threw a shoe.
N: Conor looks to Romirez.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Go ahead, Senor. I have my friend to keep me company.
E: gestures to wine
C: CONOR
D: I'll be back when I can.
N: Conor sets off across the pasture.
S: INT. CONOR'S HOME
N: Romirez enters and flops onto a cot. Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing. The room is still. Romirez begins to drowse. Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness. His hand moves under the cot. With an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges and splintered into fragments. Passing through a cloud of sawdust enters the Knight. Without pause he topples a kitchen shelf onto a supine Romirez.
C: KNIGHT
D: Romirez. What a surprise.
N: Romirez is struggling under the debris. The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg. The limb is severed.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Madonna!
N: The Knight begins casting aside the shelving. With lightning speed Romirez pulls the sword from beneath the bed and hammers it deep into the Knight's side.
C: KNIGHT
D: Bastard!
N: He crashes back against the wall. Romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword as a crutch. The Knight has regained a meager balance on his knees. Blood pours from the slice in his stomach, Romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing.
C: ROMIREZ
D: Oh, Santa Maria!
N: The Knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees beside Romirez.
C: KNIGHT
D: Why run?
C: ROMIREZ
D: Demonio!
N: The Knight's trembling hands raise his shaking sword high.
C: KNIGHT
D: To hell with you.
S: EXT. BARNYARD - DAY
N: Conor pounds at a horseshoe. The hammer slips from his grasp as he slumps forward as if pushed.
S: EXT. CONOR'S HOME - DAY
N: Badly wounded, the Knight staggers through the shattered doorway and tumbles into the street. A CHILD SCREAMS. Pulling himself up, the Knight hobbles away.
S: EXT. - DAY
N: Conor is running through the village.
S: INT. CONOR'S HOME
N: Conor rushes in and shudders to a stop. An entire wall is showered with blood. Conor walks slowly forward. Dazed. As he looks down something takes his attention. It is Romirez's severed head. Conor moans in anguish and drops to his knees on the blood- stained floor. His head sinks to his chest as he begins sobbing.

S: INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH LIBRARY
N: Somewhere in the bowels of the museum, the RESEARCH LIBRARIAN, a wiry young man, sits at his cluttered desk. Brenna looms above him.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
C: BRENNA
D: All I need is for you to check the name.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: You talked to your supervisor lately? He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight. That on top of the cops bugging him.
C: BRENNA
D: I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
N: The librarian looks her over skeptically.
C: BRENNA
D: Corey, you _owe_ me.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: It's that important?
C: BRENNA
D: Yeah.
N: The librarian reluctantly reaches for his keys.
S: INT. STORAGE AREA
N: Holding Brenna's photograph, the research librarian is comb- ing through stained binders. The room is old, disorganized, and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must be in it somewhere.
C: RESEARCHER
D: Wilson know about this?
C: BRENNA
D: I'm doing it on my own.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: Good way to lose your job.
C: BRENNA
D: Some job. Card filing and cabinet dusting. Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
C: BRENNA
D: It's bullshit. Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.

D: Why, that son of a bitch.

N: The high backed office chair is spun away from an angry, entering Brenna.

D: What's wrong Wilson, huh? Not enough excitement in your own desk? What the hell were you looking for in mine?
N: The chair turns. Detective Moran, not her supervisor, leafs through her notebook.
C: MORAN
D: A murder.
C: BRENNA
D: You better have a warrant. That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
C: MORAN
D: I've got a morgue filling up with bodies. That's my right.
C: BRENNA
D: What do you want from me?
C: MORAN
D: Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town. And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
E: looks at notebook
N: Brenna lifts the telephone receiver.
C: BRENNA
D: I'm calling an attorney.
C: MORAN
D: You and I should talk first.
C: BRENNA
D: We've got nothing to say.
N: Moran presses the post on the phone.
C: MORAN
D: What are you going to tell them? That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
C: BRENNA
D: Four?
C: MORAN
D: All fashionably without heads.
C: BRENNA
D: Spare me the details.
C: MORAN
D: But there's more. Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware. Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
C: BRENNA
D: What are you getting at, Moran?
C: MORAN
D: You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill. Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew. In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
E: looks at notebook looks up
C: BRENNA
D: It'll never stick.
C: MORAN
D: But we might just give it the 'ole college try. What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
C: BRENNA
D: You're an asshole, Moran.
C: MORAN
D: I want Taupin.
C: BRENNA
D: What makes you so sure he's the one?
C: MORAN
D: Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house. There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet. I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
C: BRENNA
D: What's all of this got to do with me?
C: MORAN
D: What were you doing in Felton?
C: BRENNA
D: Research. If your pal was there I never saw him.
C: MORAN
D: I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
C: BRENNA
D: Never take up poker, Detective.
E: knows he's bluffing
C: MORAN
D: Don't be stupid, lady. Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
N: Brenna reaches across and lifts her notebook.
C: BRENNA
D: Why don't you wait until it comes out in paperback?
N: Moran watches her leave. He lifts the telephone receiver. RESEARCH OFFICE Striding out into the corridor, Brenna passes Dennis, the cop from her bedroom, leaning against the doorway.

S: INT. CHURCH (WASHINGTON D.C.)
N: A PRIEST celebrates mass in a present-day cathedral. In the rear of the church apart from the other PARISHIONERS sits the Knight. As the priest leads the parishioners through the procession of faith, the Knight alone repeats it quietly to himself in Latin, the ancient language of the church.

CRACKS Run the length plain, spewing forth steam and staggering SKELETONS. There are dozens of them, all carrying their skulls under one arm. The skeletons press forward and trap Conor against the trunk of a dead oak. The heads break into harsh, demonic LAUGHTER. Conor puts his hands over his ears in pain as the bodies push forward. SCREAMING, he disappears under a mass of gleaming bones.

N: Passing over a rise in the highway, Brenna turns abruptly onto a service road and behind a group of trees. THE OTHER CAR Pauses a moment at the intersection, then drives on.
S: EXT. STOREFRONT - DAY
N: Brenna shows the PROPRIETOR the photograph. He explains something to her. Brenna steps outside the store onto the Main Street of the very small community of Worstick. AT A STREET CORNER Brenna passes a small monument settled in a flower bed. It has a plaque memorializing five locals murdered in 1931.

D: What's all that?
C: TAUPIN
D: Richard Taupin has become cumbersome. It would be best if he just disappeared.
N: Brenna walks to the window.

D: You did kill those men.
C: TAUPIN
D: Not all of them.
C: BRENNA
D: When you finish, what then?
C: TAUPIN
D: I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
C: BRENNA
D: You make it all sound so simple.
C: TAUPIN
D: The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired. That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg. But that's where you come in.
C: BRENNA
D: You want me to front for you.
C: TAUPIN
D: The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better. You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.

D: Regiment ready for review, sir.
N: Dupont walks past the sargeant to the line.
C: DUPONT
D: Stand straight, you are a soldier of the King.
E: to soldier
N: SOLDIER #1 Yes sir. Dupont continues down the line. Another soldier's infantry jacket is almost hilariously mis-buttoned, one collar sticking up four inches higher than the other. Dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying brass buttons onto the ground. He moves on.
C: DUPONT
D: Where is your bayonet?
E: to soldier
N: SOLIDER #3 Lost it sir.
C: DUPONT
D: Where?
N: The soldier hedges.
C: STAFF SARGEANT
D: You heard the Major! Where!
N: SOLDIER #3 Whorehouse sir. Dupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens.
C: DUPONT
D: Your rifle. Hand it to me.
N: The soldier obeys. Dupont inspects the firing mechanism.
C: DUPONT
D: The flint is cracked. No spark will reach your powder. You will die tomorrow.
N: He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands.
C: DUPONT
D: Tomorrow you go to _battle_! And you look like children! The General has charged me with seeing that you are prepared, and prepared you will be! If necessary you stand here all night! Sargeant!
E: beat
N: The sargeant leaps to attention.
C: SARGEANT
D: Yes sir.
C: DUPONT
D: See to it.
C: SARGEANT
D: Yes sir.
N: Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some- thing. He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen. His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking each face carefully. One PRIVATE seizes his attention. The private is cautious.
C: DUPONT
D: Your name?
C: MULET
D: Mulet.
N: It is as if Dupont knows him. The two stare at each other. Dupont turns and leaves.
S: INT. COTTAGE - EVENING
N: Inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters, Dupont (Conor) and several others eat their evening meal. A CAPTAIN finishes his story.
C: CAPTAIN
D: ...And what a sight! That old mare just kept falling over her own guts till someone finally shot her.
E: amused
N: The OFFICERS LAUGH. All but Dupont.
C: MAJOR
D: Complete your inspection?
E: beside Dupont
C: DUPONT
D: They're nothing but boys. It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
C: MAJOR
D: I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
E: laughs
C: DUPONT
D: We need more time.
C: MAJOR
D: Won't get it. We are a sacrifice. A diversion.

D: Eat up Dupont. It will probably be your last.
C: DUPONT
D: Not likely.
E: rises
N: Dupont goes to the window. Dusk shines orange on his face. In the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up, Mulet, is chopping firewood.
S: EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
N: Several hours later. Most are asleep. Mulet continues his wood splitting. From out of the dark cottage steps Dupont.
C: DUPONT
D: I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
E: CONOR

D: Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
C: DUPONT
D: What is your position?
C: MULET
D: Second musketeer.
C: DUPONT
D: I understand you joined up in Bremen.
C: MULET
D: You seem to understand a great deal.
C: DUPONT
D: I am a Major, Private. You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
C: MULET
D: Excuse me, "sir". I thought we spoke as equals.
C: DUPONT
D: Equals?
C: MULET
D: If you wish to play games, Major.
E: shrugs
N: Mulet returns to his chore.
C: DUPONT
D: Wait. I think we understand each other.
C: MULET
D: We have no understanding.
C: DUPONT
D: Then it is time two of us did. You are very young. I was once young. I can help.
N: Mulet LAUGHS.
C: MULET
D: Help? I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
C: DUPONT
D: It can be different. It must be.
C: MULET
D: It never changes, Major.
N: Mulet turns to his chore. Dupont grabs his arm.
C: DUPONT
D: We must talk.
C: MULET
D: Stay out of it.
E: shakes him off
C: DUPONT
D: Don't threaten me, Private.
E: angry
C: MULET
D: Who do you think I am? One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow? "Threaten you"? You and I just living will always be a threat. Forever. Look at your life, Major. Look at mine. Nothing there but threat. Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
E: disgust
N: Mulet turns his back on Dupont.
T: Dupont draws his cutlass.
C: DUPONT
D: Do not turn your back on me.
C: MULET
D: You are really going to force this, aren't you?
C: DUPONT
D: Either you are with me or against me.
N: Mulet turns slowly, axe in hand.
C: MULET
D: Have I a choice?
N: The two stare into eyes empty of emotion. Mulet's hand flinches. An attack? Dupont CUTS quickly, slicing open both of Mulet's arms. The axe drops to the ground. Mulet seems strangely calm.
C: MULET
D: You see Major? You are not so different.
N: Dupont cuts off Mulet's head where he stands.
S: EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
N: Dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into a swamp.
S: INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
N: It is very late. Only a few OFFICERS are seated in the pews. Dupont tries to concentrate on prayer, but is distracted.
C: MULET
D: You see Major? You are not so different...
E: voice flashback
C: DUPONT
D: I had no choice.
N: Dupont sighs and looks to the altar.
C: DUPONT
D: Who am I deceiving?
C: KNIGHT
D: Certainly not me.
N: Dupont whirls around to see the Knight, dressed as he in uniform, sitting one row behind. Dupont leaps to his feet.
C: KNIGHT
D: You needn't look so flushed, Major. You are quite safe in church.
N: Dupont eases his breathing.
C: KNIGHT
D: State of grace and all that.
C: DUPONT
D: Tradition.
C: KNIGHT
D: It's all we have.
N: Dupont has backed up a few paces.
C: KNIGHT
D: All this time and still a scared little boy.
N: Dupont sits down.
C: DUPONT
D: Not so scared.
C: KNIGHT
D: Perhaps not. You seem to have misplaced a private. No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
E: smiles
C: DUPONT
D: No doubt.
C: KNIGHT
D: You surprise me. Eliminating a rival like that. Such are the actions of a man of conquest. I was mistaken. 300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
C: DUPONT
D: You're wrong.
C: KNIGHT
D: I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you. Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision. It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
N: The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont.
C: DUPONT
D: Romirez understood. Not you.
C: KNIGHT
D: Romirez is dust.
N: The Knight looks to the altar.
C: KNIGHT
D: Finish your prayers?
C: DUPONT
D: Finish yours?
C: KNIGHT
D: Our common heritage. I am your only real friend, you know. The only one who truly understands you. I look forward to the day we meet again. And I kill you.
E: smiles beat rises
C: DUPONT
D: So sure?
N: The Knight leans forward and puts his face very near.
C: KNIGHT
D: You can't stay in church forever.
N: The Knight moves into the aisle.
C: KNIGHT
D: Good night, Major.
N: He exits. Conor sits in the dim church alone. Very alone.

S: EXT. WORSTICK CHURCH (PRESENT DAY)
N: Richard Taupin sits against the stone of an old Catholic church. Taupin sighs. A long, weary sigh.
S: INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE
N: Taupin and Brenna sit at a table working on forms. Taupin looks up from his work and studies Brenna's face without malice.
S: EXT. CREEK - DAY
N: Brenna and Taupin are taking a walk along the township's outskirts. Crossing a small bridge over a smaller creek, they encounter the elderly caretaker Mr. North and his eight year old GRANDSON. Both with fishing poles.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Morning Mr. North
C: TAUPIN
D: Same.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Such a pretty day. If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this. Mind you I'm 74 now.
C: TAUPIN
D: No.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Yes sir. When you get older your priorities change. It's the simple things that count. Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
C: TAUPIN
D: I'm sure that's true.
N: The grandson is having difficulty baiting his line. Taupin bends down beside the young fisherman.
C: TAUPIN
D: Here. The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
E: takes worm
C: GRANDSON
D: Thanks.
N: Taupin's show of affection surprises Brenna.
C: TAUPIN
D: Show you a trick.
N: Taupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them around the hook.
C: TAUPIN
D: Fish are creatures of habit. They like their food where they're used to it. At the top, hiding in old leaves.
C: GRANDSON
D: Where did you learn that?
C: TAUPIN
D: My father taught me.
C: GRANDSON
D: Your father must be smart.
C: TAUPIN
D: Yes, he was.
N: Brenna is touched.
S: INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Brenna lies on her bed thinking. She puts on a robe and walks into the living room. LIVING ROOM Taupin sits before the fireplace, its flames reflecting on his brandy glass. Brenna moves quietly to a seat beside him.
C: TAUPIN
D: There was a man once. Just a simple woodcarver. But he understood. More than anyone he could see to the heart of it. It never ends. Today is the same as the first. Tomorrow will be the same as today. So much time. And all of it wasted. You love history?
E: eyes on the fireplace beat beat
C: BRENNA
D: Yes.
C: TAUPIN
D: I wish I could.
S: INT. CITY HALL
N: Brenna looks through a property zoning book.
S: EXT. WORSTICK MAIN STREET - DAY
N: Walking past small town stores, Brenna allows herself a moment to window shop. IN A SHOP WINDOW Is a small poster advertising a community get-together. Brenna peels it off the glass and slips it into her notebook.
S: INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE
N: Brenna and Taupin go over various forms and documents.
C: BRENNA
D: The estate stuff is pretty straight forward. Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
C: TAUPIN
D: It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
N: Brenna is silent.
C: TAUPIN
D: Second thoughts?
N: Pause.
C: BRENNA
D: No. So what now? We just wait?
E: beat
C: TAUPIN
D: Yes.
C: BRENNA
D: Well, as long as we're stuck here.
N: She hands him the poster from earlier.
C: BRENNA
D: It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
C: TAUPIN
D: They do it each year.
C: BRENNA
D: I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
N: Taupin stacks the documents into a folder.
C: TAUPIN
D: Maybe it would do us both good.
C: BRENNA
D: There's a catch. You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR
N: Taupin is going through an old trunk.
C: TAUPIN
D: My father was something of a junk collector.
N: He comes across a long period dress and offers it to Brenna.
C: TAUPIN
D: Here, try this. I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
C: BRENNA
D: It's beautiful.
C: TAUPIN
D: A little dusty.
N: Taupin fishes through the trunk and comes up with an old top hat. He turns it over in his hand with stoic memory.

S: EXT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - DUSK
N: Conor and a beautiful young woman, KATHERINE, sit on the porch steps in 1800s period dress. Other young COUPLES relax nearby enjoying the warm summer's twilight. Katherine's MOTHER shuffles between the couples offering lemonade, cakes, and the like.
C: KATHERINE
D: Do it again.
N: She is thoroughly charmed by Conor.
C: CONOR
D: All right.
N: Conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers. By turning his hand over and bending his knuckles just so, the web becomes the outline of a lion..
C: CONOR
D: A lion.
E: growls
N: Katherine is delighted. Conor starts to remove the yarn. Katherine touches his arm.
C: KATHERINE
D: Oh please. Another one.
C: CONOR
D: What would you like?
C: KATHERINE
D: Something pretty.
C: CONOR
D: Like you.
N: Conor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a four leaf clover.
C: KATHERINE
D: That's wonderful. Where did you ever learn it?
C: CONOR
D: Far away.
C: KATHERINE
D: Kiss me.
N: Conor shoots a glance for the mother, then kisses Katherine softly.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: You'll be leaving the girl alone.
E: o.s.
N: A YOUNG MAN stands a few yards from the stairs.
C: KATHERINE
D: David.
C: CONOR
D: Do you have cause to bothering us?
C: YOUNG MAN
D: That's my girl.
C: KATHERINE
D: David, we've already spoken of this.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: He's not what he pretends to be.
N: Conor climbs to his feet.
C: CONOR
D: You best leave, son.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: You think you're so high and mighty, coming into town and taking a man's woman. Well I know about you. I know about the things you do.
C: CONOR
D: I said you best leave.
E: moving closer
C: YOUNG MAN
D: You'd like that, wouldn't you? Ask him about his friends. The ones he meets in the town square. Ask him about the blade he keeps beneath his bed.
E: to Katherine
N: Conor grabs the youth's collar and pulls him close.
C: CONOR
D: Leave. While you still can.
E: like ice
N: The youth pushes away from the grasp.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: You don't frighten me.
C: CONOR
D: I should.
N: The young man throws a fist at Conor. It is easily blocked. Conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks the young man gasping onto the ground. Katherine runs up behind and grabs Conor's outstretched arm.
C: KATHERINE
D: No! Leave him. Please don't hurt him. Please.
N: COUGHING painfully, the youth climbs to his feet and staggers away.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: He's not what you think.
N: He turns and runs down the road.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: He's not what you think!
N: Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice.

S: INT. WORSTICK TOWN HALL (PRESENT DAY)
N: An auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and strung paper into a small town party. TEENAGERS in period dress control the floor, dancing to a decidedly un-period ROCK BAND. The OLDER GUESTS are gathered around the punch bowl talking crops or Pennsylvania politics. BRENNA Fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress, enters with Taupin, himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape. His clothes fit perfectly. Mr. North, comically dressed as a pirate, greets them.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Mr. Taupin! Glad you could make it. Best get some punch before it's gone. Near the whole valley showed up.
N: They go to the table. Taupin pours a glass of punch. An ELDERLY WOMAN approaches him.
C: WOMAN
D: If I didn't know better I'd say William Taupin.
C: TAUPIN
D: His son. Richard.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Mr. Taupin is up from Washington to look over his father's estate.
C: WOMAN
D: Your father died some years ago. This is your first visit?
N: The tone is snide.
C: TAUPIN
D: Of sorts.
C: WOMAN
D: I suppose a Taupin had to show up eventually.
E: walks away
C: TAUPIN
D: Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
N: She turns in surprise at his knowing her name, then walks on.
C: BRENNA
D: What was all that about?
C: MR. NORTH
D: Sorry Mr. Taupin. That's not meant for you. Just some didn't take much to your father.
C: BRENNA
D: Why?
C: TAUPIN
D: My father was never one for social whirls.
C: MR. TAUPIN
D: Kept to himself for sure. Then with all that business in '31.
C: BRENNA
D: What business?
C: MR. NORTH
D: Family down the road from the Taupin place was murdered. All cut up they were. Horrible. Two strangers were also found with the bodies. No one ever accused William, but with his reputation as a loner and the rumors about him and some of the wives in town, folks just never forgot. Most were relieved when they heard he'd died. Sorry Mr. Taupin.
C: TAUPIN
D: Nothing to be sorry about.
C: MR. NORTH
D: Just your pappy scared some.
N: The rock band finished as a PORTLY MAN in a union soldier's uniform takes the microphone.
C: PORTLY
D: All right, the kids have had their fun. Now it's time for a little more traditional dancing.
N: The rock band gives ground to a group of older MUSICIANS. With a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles and hammer dulcimer. The costumed guests take to the floor.
C: BRENNA
D: I don't know any of these. I'll make a fool of myself.
C: TAUPIN
D: Follow me.
N: Taupin starts into it with perfect grace. A faltering Brenna tries to keep up.
C: BRENNA
D: William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
C: TAUPIN
D: Yes.
C: BRENNA
D: And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
C: TAUPIN
D: Yes.
N: They do a final turn and finish. The other DANCERS applaud.
C: BRENNA
D: You're using your son's name.
C: TAUPIN
D: No. Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to. When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
N: Brenna is staring at him.
C: TAUPIN
D: More punch?
N: He leads her to a table.
C: BRENNA
D: Then you must be at least 70 years old.
C: TAUPIN
D: At least.
C: BRENNA
D: That's impossible.
N: Several of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across the room.
S: EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT
N: A bus with "Gettysburg" across the front pulls to a stop at a dark terminal. A lone passenger steps off into the mist. It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying only a long, narrow case.
S: EXT. - NIGHT
N: Brenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall.
C: BRENNA
D: It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
C: TAUPIN
D: A factor of age.
C: BRENNA
D: I hope I never get that old.
C: TAUPIN
D: You won't.
N: Brenna pulls away.
C: BRENNA
D: I must be insane. Leaving work, ditching cops. All to follow a murderer. A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
C: TAUPIN
D: Why are you here?
C: BRENNA
D: I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write. But it's not. It's you.
E: looks at him squarely
C: TAUPIN
D: I see.
C: BRENNA
D: I'm not even sure why.
C: TAUPIN
D: Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
C: BRENNA
D: My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses. I can't stand it. But you're different. It's in your hands. A clarity.
C: TAUPIN
D: You are a very perceptive young woman.
C: BRENNA
D: Just a little crazy.
N: A thoughtful pause.
C: TAUPIN
D: Miss Cartwright, it's time I showed you something.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR
N: Taupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall. Taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something. A press from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway.
C: TAUPIN
D: Miss Cartwright?
E: gestures to interior
N: Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness. Taupin follows and switches on the light.
S: INT. HIDDEN ROOM
N: Brenna's expression changes to awe. The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic. Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras crowd the shelving and floor space. The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had taken the time to keep a scrapbook.
C: BRENNA
D: My God.
N: The sight is overwhelming.
C: TAUPIN
D: I had this room built some time ago.
N: Brenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along its intricate weaving.
C: BRENNA
D: Who are you?
C: TAUPIN
D: That would be difficult to explain.
C: BRENNA
D: I'd like you to try.
N: Taupin picks up a Byzantine icon, brushing the dust from its shoulders.
C: TAUPIN
D: I was born Conor MacLeod in the village of Ardvrek on the High- land plain of Strathnaver in the clan of MacLeod under the King of Scotland. On the eleventh of December, 1408.
N: He replaces the icon.
C: TAUPIN
D: I have served in the armies of twelve nations, married nine women, fathered thirty-eight children and buried them all.
N: Taupin walks along the cases.
C: TAUPIN
D: I carried that rifle in World War I. This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria. The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College. Class of 1672. It goes on.
E: beat
C: BRENNA
D: That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
C: TAUPIN
D: Yes.
C: BRENNA
D: He knows about you.
C: TAUPIN
D: He is older than I.
C: BRENNA
D: What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
C: TAUPIN
D: Sometimes I think it's just for something to do. A conquest to be the last. Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away. Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
C: BRENNA
D: That's insane.
C: TAUPIN
D: Perhaps. There is something more. An inheritance.
C: BRENNA
D: Of bodies.
C: TAUPIN
D: I didn't kill the watchman.
C: BRENNA
D: You killed those other two.
C: TAUPIN
D: Not the same.
C: BRENNA
D: What about that family in '31?
C: TAUPIN
D: Sometimes innocents become involved.
C: BRENNA
D: You and your buddy make a real team, don't you? Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
C: TAUPIN
D: There are differences.
C: BRENNA
D: You kill with your left hand?
C: TAUPIN
D: I haven't killed _you_.
C: BRENNA
D: Is that a threat?
N: Taupin moves very close.
C: TAUPIN
D: No.
N: Brenna's face softens. She turns away.

N: The old woman.
C: MINISTER
D: And brother to Howard and James-
N: The two middle aged sons. CONOR Watches the funeral quietly at a distance. THE OLD WOMAN As the minister continues allows her gaze to wander. She sees Conor standing at the treeline. Her eyes crinkle in disbelief. Releasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor. Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony. CONOR Watches the woman approach but decides against moving. She stops a few paces away and looks over him.

C: TAUPIN
D: "Brenna". In Celtic is means "woman with raven hair". Only chieftan's daughters were allowed it.
N: Brenna is lost in Taupin's scars.
C: BRENNA
D: What is it like? Being you?
C: TAUPIN
D: Empty. And fear. Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you. It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
C: BRENNA
D: But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
C: TAUPIN

C: MORAN
D: Are you sure?
C: INSPECTOR
D: Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon. Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse. It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
C: MORAN

N: A pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor.
S: INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE
N: Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two CLERKS sit in an office mostly cleared of employees. Brenna hands the slip to a clerk. CLERK #2 I'll be right back. She disappears into the rear area.
C: BRENNA
D: Do you have a drinking fountain?
E: to other clerk
N: CLERK #3 Around the corner. Brenna steps around and takes a drink. She looks into her reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling with her hair. THE CLERK Still hasn't returned. Brenna drums her fingers on the counter top and looks around the office. The second clerk is also gone. Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk. She steps over to it. It is a large blood stain. Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors. They're closed. Brenna rushes to the doors. Someone's locked them. She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight walking to her with his stained sword. With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and runs down an opposite corridor. THE KNIGHT Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM of his palm. BRENNA Has run out of corridor. She looks back at the Knight closing the distance. CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for a way out. The Knight is nearly upon her. In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing its heavy door. THE CLOSET Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops. Her BREATHING is at a PANIC. THE KNIGHT Tries the door handle. Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into the wood.
C: BRENNA
D: Oh God...
E: crying
N: He STRIKES again. And again. Splinters smack against surround- ing walls.
C: BRENNA
D: Go away! Oh God, go away!
N: CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch. THE KNIGHT Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing. Brenna SCREAMS. The door collapses.

C: KNIGHT
D: Welcome.
N: Taupin stands at the entrance.
C: KNIGHT
D: Kahn sends his best.
N: In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of death still pressed into the face. Taupin's eyes return slowly to the Knight and Brenna.
C: TAUPIN
D: Let her go.
N: The Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall.
C: KNIGHT
D: You disappoint me. I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
E: looks at Brenna
C: TAUPIN
D: Leave her out of this.
C: KNIGHT
D: As you wish.
N: The Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle. Taupin does the same. The weapons are CLANKED together twice, then pulled back into battle position. The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an opening. The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high walls. Another ATTACK without result.
C: KNIGHT
D: You can do better than that.
N: Taupin swings. The Knight jumps back. Sweat gleams from their brows.
S: EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT
N: Two LOVERS enjoy a late night walk along the tidal basin. There is a distant CLANKING of metal.

N: The Knight and Taupin are PANTING heavily. The Knight goes low. Taupin blocks. The Knight comes overhead quickly. Taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his shoulder and chest. The impact knocks him flat on his back. The Knight looks down on his wounded prey. A SCREECH of brakes from outside the monument. Two OFFICERS are coming up the steps.
C: KNIGHT
D: No. Not now.
S: EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT
N: The officers reach the top and enter. INSIDE One of the officers is Dennis, who sees only a CRYING Brenna and Taupin lying wounded on the floor.

N: The Knight walks from the two officers spread out like rag dolls on the floor.
C: KNIGHT
D: Get up.
E: to Taupin
N: Taupin looks at Brenna and the dead policemen. A resignation sweeps over him.
C: TAUPIN
D: What's the point?
C: KNIGHT
D: This isn't done. Get up.
C: TAUPIN
D: What's the point! You have me, finish it!
C: KNIGHT
D: I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
C: TAUPIN
D: Tradition.
E: irony
C: KNIGHT
D: It's all we have.
C: TAUPIN
D: Go to hell.
N: The Knight looks to Brenna.
C: KNIGHT
D: Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
C: TAUPIN
D: Leave her alone.
C: KNIGHT
D: Get up.
N: Taupin struggles to his feet. Blood pouring from his shirt, he stands uneasily with his sword at ready. The Knight swings. Taupin blocks.
S: EXT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT
N: Moran drives up. There is an empty police car, the door still ajar.
S: INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT
N: Taupin is badly outclassed. He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws him again to the floor.
C: BRENNA
D: You bastard!
C: KNIGHT
D: Be silent.
C: BRENNA
D: Leave him alone.
C: KNIGHT
D: You will be silent!!
N: The voice is THUNDERING. Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor. His teeth grind in pain. The Knight smiles.
C: KNIGHT
D: I do hope you're enjoying this as much as me.
N: MORAN Stands in the entryway. The Knight sees him.
C: KNIGHT
D: Get out.
N: Moran draws his pistol. The Knight walks toward him,
C: KNIGHT
D: This is nothing that concerns you.
N: Moran levels his gun. The Knight raises his sword.
C: KNIGHT
D: You will leave!
N: Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES. The slugs slam into the Knight, blowing him off his feet. He lies still. Moran looks to Brenna. To Taupin. Then he walks closer to the Knight.
C: TAUPIN
D: Don't.
E: hoarse
N: Taupin curls in a spasm of pain. Moran moves closer. The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over his heart. He isn't breathing. Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face.
C: TAUPIN
D: Stop. You don't understand.
N: The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's chest. The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall. Taupin crawls for the Knight. Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes. The Knight, blood pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts quickly. Moran slides off the sword dead. Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest. The Knight GAGS in surprise and crumples. Taupin CUTS again, then puts the blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat.
C: TAUPIN
D: In mamus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum. Auditorium nostrum in nomine Domine.
N: He raises the sword.
C: TAUPIN
D: Requiescant in pace.
N: And CUTS the Knight's head off. Taupin drops his sword. His breathing quickens. A sensation sweeps over him. Taupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING. He sucks in painful gulps of air.
C: BRENNA
D: My God.
N: Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.
C: BRENNA
D: Conor.
N: Taupin is looking past her. A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder. She SCREAMS. The headless body of the Knight stands beside her. THE KNIGHT'S HEAD Lies on the floor. The eyes open. The face pulls into a smile.
C: KNIGHT
D: And now you know.
N: The eyes roll up into the skull. The face slackens. The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses to the ground. TAUPIN Is CRYING. Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something else.
C: BRENNA
D: What's wrong?
C: TAUPIN
D: I can't stand it. Oh God, I can't stand it!
N: Brenna kneels beside him.
C: TAUPIN
D: The scream of your blood. The shriek of trees. Stop it! Stop it!
N: Brenna SOBS.
C: BRENNA
D: What is it?
C: TAUPIN
D: I'm the last. Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
N: Taupin doubles over in pain. The pain of the whole world trying to force itself into him. Brenna tries to hold him. He pushes her savagely away.
C: TAUPIN
D: Get out.
C: BRENNA
D: No!
C: TAUPIN
D: I'll destroy you. I've destroyed everything I've ever touched! Oh God...
N: He doubles over in pain.
C: BRENNA
D: Conor...
N: He grabs his sword and threatens her.
C: TAUPIN
D: _Get out_!
N: SOBBING, Brenna runs from the memorial. Taupin is alone. Bleeding. Crying. In agony.
T: FADE OUT FADE UP:
S: INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM
N: Brenna at work in the research area. She's silent. Distant. Something is missing from her.
S: EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY
N: Brenna stands in the street before Taupin's townhouse. A boarded up window. A for-sale sign. Taupin is gone forever. As if he never was.
S: INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT
N: A desk. A single light. A cup of coffee. A typewriter. Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface. CLACK-CLACK. It is at last her journal article. She types a line, then rips it from the carriage and tears it to pieces. The thoughts won't come.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY
N: Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group of wild park cats. A shadow covers her face. She looks up. It is Taupin. Something has changed him. His face is less cynical. More vulnerable. More human. He sits down on the grass beside her.
C: BRENNA
D: What are we supposed to say?
E: after a moment
N: The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin. They cautiously shrink away, frightened.
C: TAUPIN
D: The emptyness. The years and years of void. Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
C: BRENNA
D: The inheritance.
C: TAUPIN
D: Not power. Not control.
N: Taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him.
C: TAUPIN
D: Life. It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
C: BRENNA
D: You have lived forever.
C: TAUPIN
D: Life is only life when it is bounded by death. The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric. The inside. I love you Brenna.
E: turns to Brenna
N: Brenna's chin quivers.
C: TAUPIN
D: It will be horrible. The future. I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing. Nothing but a moment. Maybe two. But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
C: BRENNA
D: Yes.
E: crying
N: He holds her. They hold each other.
C: TAUPIN
D: It's taken me so long. So very long.
N: A jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own.
T: FADE OUT
N: _END_
