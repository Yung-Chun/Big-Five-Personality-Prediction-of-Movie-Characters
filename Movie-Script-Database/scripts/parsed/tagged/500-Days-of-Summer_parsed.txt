M: First Draft
N: SIMPLE BLACK ON WHITE CREDITS ROLL TO BIG STAR'S "I'M IN LOVE WITH A GIRL." When all is said and done, up comes a single number in parenthesis, like so:
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says a word. CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants to be looked at. A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.
C: NARRATOR
D: This is a story of boy meets girl.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t- shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.
C: NARRATOR
D: The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his... "soulmate."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT LIVING ROOM - 1989
N: PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV, we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!"
C: NARRATOR
D: This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, "The Graduate."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY
N: The girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to get away with it.
C: NARRATOR
D: The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT BATHROOM - 1994
N: Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair extends down to her lower back.
C: NARRATOR
D: Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things. The first was her long blonde hair.
N: She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.
C: NARRATOR
D: The second was how easily she could cut it off... And feel nothing.
T: CUT TO:
S: SPLITSCREEN. INT BOARDROOM/ INT CUBICLE - SAME
N: On the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to some boring presentation. On the left, Summer answers a call, takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long narrow hallway.
C: NARRATOR
D: Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building. In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for.
N: CU Summer opening the door to the boardroom, about to come face to face with Tom for the first time.
C: NARRATOR
D: This is a story of boy meets girl.
N: But before they do,
T: CUT TO:
N: BLACK.
C: NARRATOR
D: You should know up front, this is not a love story.
S: EXT STREETS OF SAN FRAN - NIGHT
N: A 12 year old GIRL rides her bicycle down the block. She arrives at an apartment complex, jumps off the bike and races up the front stairs. She rings the doorbell.
S: INT TOM'S PLACE - LATER
N: PAUL and MCKENZIE open the door. These are Tom's best friends since birth. Paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs. McKenzie works in the cubicle next to Tom.
C: PAUL
D: I didn't know who else to call.
N: The Girl removes her bike helmet.
C: GIRL
D: You did the right thing. Where is he?
N: Tom is in the kitchen breaking things and basically going insane. About to smash a plate on the floor, he's interrupted BY:
C: GIRL
D: Thomas.
N: Tom freezes.
C: TOM
D: Rachel? What are you doing here?
C: GIRL
D: I'm here to help you.
E: RACHEL
C: TOM
D: Help me how?
C: RACHEL
D: First, put down the plate.
N: Tom slowly obliges.
C: RACHEL
D: Now come here and sit down.
N: Tom sits next to the young girl. Paul and Mckenzie sit on either side of them.
C: RACHEL
D: The key is not to panic.
C: TOM
D: I think I'm gonna be sick.
C: RACHEL
D: Drink this.
N: She hands him a glass of water. Tom drinks it down.
C: MCKENZIE
D: What is that?
C: RACHEL
D: Vodka.
C: TOM
D: More.
E: grimacing at the taste
N: He gulps another down.
C: TOM
D: Does Mom know you're here? It's gotta be past 10.
C: RACHEL
D: Don't worry about it. Start from the beginning. Tell us what happened...
N: Tom takes a deep breath.

S: INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE

D: Just like that?
C: TOM
D: Just like that.
C: PAUL
D: Did she say why?
S: INT DINER - AS BEFORE
C: SUMMER
D: This thing. This whatever it is. You and me. Do you think this is normal?
C: TOM
D: I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy?
C: SUMMER
D: You're happy?
C: TOM
D: You're not?
C: SUMMER
D: All we do is argue!
C: TOM
D: That is such a lie!
S: INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE
C: RACHEL
D: Maybe she was just in a bad mood.
C: PAUL
D: A hormonal thing.
C: RACHEL
D: P.M.S.?
C: TOM
D: What do you know about PMS?
E: to Rachel
C: RACHEL
D: More than you.
C: TOM
D: Oh my god.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Please continue.
S: INT DINER - AS BEFORE
C: SUMMER
D: This can't be a total surprise. I mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months.
C: TOM
D: Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.
C: SUMMER
D: No... I'm Sid.
C: TOM
D: So I'm Nancy?!
E: BEAT
N: The Waitress comes out with the food. Tom and Summer stop their discussion until the meal is served and the Waitress leaves. Summer starts to eat.
C: SUMMER
D: Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after. I'm starving.
N: Without another word she goes back to her pancakes. Tom watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the history of mankind.
C: SUMMER
D: Mmm, you're so right. These are great!
E: mouth full
N: Tom looks at his food in disgust. He may never eat again.
C: SUMMER
D: What?
E: INNOCENT
N: Tom stands up to go.
C: SUMMER
D: Tom, don't. Come back. You're still my best fr---
N: THE SCENE FREEZES AND WE ZOOM IN ON TOM'S STUNNED FACE.
S: INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE
N: Silence for a few beats.
C: PAUL
D: Jesus.
C: MCKENZIE
D: That's harsh.
C: TOM
D: I don't know what I'm gonna do.
C: RACHEL
D: You're gonna be fine.
C: TOM
D: I'm gonna throw up.
E: BEAT
C: MCKENZIE
D: Or that.
C: RACHEL
D: Here.
N: Tom drinks more vodka.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Come on Hansen. You'll be ok. You're the best guy I know. You'll find someone.
C: PAUL
D: You know what they say...there's plenty other fish in the sea.
C: TOM
D: No.
C: PAUL
D: Sure they do. They say that.
C: TOM
D: Well they're wrong. It's not true. I've fished in that sea. I've jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm fucking Aquaman! Sorry. What I mean is... there are no other fish. This was my fish.
E: to Rachel
N: Paul and McKenzie share a very concerned look.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT SIDEWALK - DAY
N: Tom walks alongside his friend PAUL. Out of nowhere, he says:
C: TOM
D: I'm in love with Summer.
C: PAUL
D: For real?
E: BEAT
T: CUT TO:

N: CU - SUMMER'S NECK
C: TOM
D: I love the scar on her neck from this operation she had as a kid.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER'S BREASTS (UNDER A BLACK T-SHIRT)
C: TOM

C: TOM
D: I love how I hear this song every time I think of her.
E: V.O.
N: CU - TOM, STARING DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA.
C: TOM
D: I love how she makes me feel. Like anything's possible. Like, I don't know...like life is worth it.
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT SIDEWALK - SAME
N: Paul and Tom.
C: TOM
D: For real, Paul. I'm madly in love with that girl.
N: Paul is silent for a beat.
C: PAUL
D: Oh shit.
S: INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Tom as we saw him earlier. Bored. In the boardroom. Mckenzie is in mid-presentation.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Now I know this may be a little risque...but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that.
N: Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from "Jerry Maguire".
C: MCKENZIE
D: May 21st. Other Mother's Day.
N: The co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of the department.
C: VANCE
D: Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman's "Magellan Day" I'd say we've got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these?
N: Tom is about to answer when... the door opens.
C: SUMMER
D: Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a call for you on line 3.
N: And in walks this girl. Summer. We've met her by now but Tom hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from that moment on, he can't take them off her.
C: VANCE
D: Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here from...
E: to the table
C: SUMMER
D: Michigan.
C: VANCE
D: Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this.
C: SUMMER
D: Nice to meet you all.
N: Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out. She doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen God. (3, 4, 5)
S: INT. OFFICE - DAY
N: Tom trying to work. And failing. He turns to McKenzie.
C: TOM
D: What do we know about this new girl?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Who?
C: TOM
D: The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Dude. I hear she's a bitch from hell!
C: TOM
D: Really?
E: DISAPPOINTED
C: MCKENZIE
D: Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it.
C: TOM
D: Maybe she was just in a hurry.
C: MCKENZIE
D: And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank.
C: TOM
D: Damn.
C: MCKENZIE
D: I know. She's pretty hot.
C: TOM
D: That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Dunno.
C: TOM
D: Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin...
C: MCKENZIE
D: ...and really good teeth.
C: TOM
D: And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Women.
E: as explanation
C: TOM
D: Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - LATER
N: Tom is listening to headphones. Summer enters the elevator and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her. Summer hears the music.
C: SUMMER
D: The Smiths.
N: Tom, pretending not to hear or care, gives her an unenthusiastic wave.
C: SUMMER
D: I love The Smiths.
N: Tom, still pretending, takes off his headphones.
C: TOM
D: Sorry?
C: SUMMER
D: I said. I love The Smiths. You have good taste in music.
N: A beat as Tom processes this information.
C: TOM
D: You like the Smiths?
E: AMAZED
C: SUMMER
D: "To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die." Love it.
E: SINGING
N: The elevator doors open and she gets off.
C: TOM
D: Oh my god.
E: accidentally out loud
S: INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
N: The office sings "Happy Birthday" to a FEMALE CO-WORKER. When they get to the part about her name, Tom is the only one who knows it, everyone else just there for the cake. Song over, everyone digs in. Tom finds himself standing next to Summer.
C: TOM
D: Hi.
C: SUMMER
D: Hello.
C: TOM
D: So, uh, Summer...
C: SUMMER
D: Tom.
C: TOM
D: Yeah! How's it going so far?
C: SUMMER
D: The city or the firm?
C: TOM
D: Both... Either.
C: SUMMER
D: I'm happy. Still getting situated. How long have you worked here?
C: TOM
D: Oh, you know, 4, 5... years.
C: SUMMER
D: Really? Jesus. Did you always want to write greeting cards?
C: TOM
D: Are you nuts? I don't even want to do it now.
C: SUMMER
D: What is it you want to do?
C: TOM
D: I studied to be an architect actually.
C: SUMMER
D: That's so cool! What happened?
C: TOM
D: Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved to the city to work for a company. Company went under. Needed a job. My friend worked here. Got me this.
C: SUMMER
D: And are you any good?
C: TOM
D: Well I wrote that one.
E: points to a framed card
C: SUMMER
D: "Today You're a Man. Mazel Tov on your Bar Mitzvah."
E: READING
C: TOM
D: It's a big seller.
C: SUMMER
D: I meant, are you any good as an architect?
C: TOM
D: Oh... No. I doubt it.
C: SUMMER
D: Well, I'd say you're a perfectly ...adequate... greeting card writer.
C: TOM
D: Why thank you. That's what they called me in college. "Perfectly adequate" Hansen.
C: SUMMER
D: They used to call me "Anal Girl."
N: Tom does a spit-take and almost chokes.
C: SUMMER
D: I was very neat and organized.
E: EXPLAINING
N: There's an awkward silence.
C: SUMMER
D: Anyway, I should get back.
C: TOM
D: Ok, well, I'll see you around.
N: She walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall. Tom watches her walk away, completely enamored. He sits down at his desk and sets out to work. But before he does, his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house. It's dated 2001 and it's the only architecture sketch on his wall.
S: INT TOM'S PLACE - DAY
N: Tom is playing Playstation with Rachel.
C: TOM
D: And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper.
C: RACHEL
D: Your favorites.
C: TOM
D: We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing.
C: RACHEL
D: Oh boy.
C: TOM
D: What?
C: RACHEL
D: You know...just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her "the one."
C: TOM
D: Of course it does.
E: BEAT
C: SARAH
D: Dinner!
E: O.S.
N: SARAH, 50s, Tom and Rachel's mother, stands in the doorway.
C: SARAH
D: Pause and come eat.
N: They do. Tom enters the living room area and sits down next to his stepdad MARTIN, 60s, a quiet, professorial Southern gentleman type.
C: TOM
D: Hey Martin.
N: ANGLE ON RACHEL and Sarah.
C: RACHEL
D: He met a girl.
C: SARAH
D: Yeah?
E: EXCITED
C: RACHEL
D: Yeah.
E: GRIM
N: Sarah grows serious too.
C: SARAH
D: Oh shit.
T: CUT TO:
N: STOCK FOOTAGE. The Wright Brothers, Galileo, Heaven's Gate, Neil Armstrong.
C: NARRATOR
D: When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds.
N: END ON: LITTLE TOM, age 6, mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of Olivia Newton-John in "Xanadu."
C: NARRATOR
D: Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of "true love." The evidence did not support him.
E: BEAT
T: CUT TO:
N: (-8914)
S: INT CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Little Tom stares at a LITTLE GIRL, 6, who has the same hairstyle and dress as Newton-John on that cover. Tom draws a picture. It's a boy and a girl with a giant heart over them. He stands up and walks over to the girl, putting the picture on her desk. Not a word is spoken. Satisfied, he returns to his seat and waits to see what happens.
C: NARRATOR
D: Exhibit A: Lisa Rayner.
N: The Little Girl stands up and walks the picture over to ANOTHER BOY. Tom is mortified. The OTHER BOY eats the drawing. (-5313)
S: EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT
N: A BLONDE CHEERLEADER leads the crowd in a cheer. PAN ACROSS to find TEENAGE TOM, 15, finishing making out with a homely HIGH SCHOOL GIRL. He says goodbye and walks off, looking back longingly.

N: Once Tom is out of frame, a SECOND BOY approaches Wendy. Then they start making out. (-2825)
S: INT AIRPLANE - DAY
N: COLLEGE TOM sits next to his girlfriend REBECCA MYLES. His smile gleams.

C: NARRATOR
D: Exhibit C: Rebecca Myles.
C: TOM
D: And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever!

N: (-734)
S: EXT CAR - NIGHT
N: Younger Tom sits in the passenger seat. Raven-haired AMANDA drives.
C: NARRATOR
D: And, finally... Exhibit D: Amanda Heller.
C: AMANDA
D: It's just... it's complicated.
C: TOM
D: What's complicated? Last week you said you loved me!
C: AMANDA
D: I know it's sudden but...
C: TOM
D: No, this can't be. Everything was going so great. I don't understand.
C: AMANDA
D: Here.
E: BEAT
C: TOM
D: What's this?
N: She puts a disc into the cd player.
C: AMANDA
D: Because you're, like, the biggest music nerd I've ever met, I think this should really help explain where I'm coming from.
N: A pop song begins to play on the stereo. They listen for a few beats. Tom is confused.
C: AMANDA
D: You remember how much I loved this song when you first played it for me?
C: TOM
D: Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks.
C: AMANDA
D: Right. And I still like it, don't get me wrong. It's just... When I hear it now, I don't feel the same...rush.
C: TOM
D: Ok...
E: still confused
C: AMANDA
D: I press the skip button.
N: Still Tom doesn't understand.
C: TOM
D: What does this have to do with--?
C: AMANDA
D: I'd rather listen to something else.
N: And with that, it slowly sinks in for him.
C: TOM
D: But Amanda... this is a great fucking song!
S: INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - HAPPY HOUR
N: Tom removes his headphones and sits defeated with McKenzie and Paul in a booth.
C: TOM
D: It's off.
C: PAUL
D: What?
C: TOM
D: Me and Summer.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Was it ever on?
C: TOM
D: No. But it could have been. In a world where good things happen to me.
C: PAUL
D: Yeah well, that's not really where we live.
C: TOM
D: No.
C: MCKENZIE
D: So what happened?
C: TOM
D: You ready for this?
S: INT ELEVATOR - THE DAY BEFORE
N: Tom is alone. The door opens. In walks Summer.
C: TOM
D: So there we are. All alone. Nine more floors to ride. Plenty of time. I figure...this is my chance. If not now when, right?
E: V.O.
N: They ride in silence for a few beats.
C: TOM
D: Summer...
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah?
C: TOM
D: So how was your weekend?
E: BEAT
C: SUMMER
D: It was good.
S: INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE
N: The friends wait for more.
C: TOM
D: You believe that shit?
C: MCKENZIE
D: What shit?
C: PAUL
D: I think I missed something.
C: TOM
D: "It was good." She didn't say "It was good." She said "It was good." Emphasis on the good. She basically said "I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym." Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over.
N: Everyone's silent.
C: MCKENZIE
D: What the hell is wrong with you?!
C: PAUL
D: Dude, you got problems.
C: TOM
D: She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Based on..."it was good?"
C: TOM
D: And some other things.
C: PAUL
D: Like what, she said "hey" instead of "hi" cause that totally means she's a lesbian.
C: TOM
D: I gave her all sorts of chances.
S: INT OFFICE - DAY
N: Tom types at his desk. Summer approaches the cubicle Tom shares with McKenzie.
C: SUMMER
D: I'm going to the supply room. Anyone need anything?
C: MCKENZIE
D: No thanks.
C: TOM
D: I think you know what I need.
N: There's a beat.
C: TOM
D: Toner.
C: SUMMER
D: Oh ok, sure, no prob.
S: INT OFFICE - LATE IN THE DAY
N: The office is emptying out. Only a few people remain but Tom and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's "I Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner. No reaction from Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down, defeated.
S: INT SUMMER'S DESK
N: Tom is there.
C: TOM
D: Do you want to go out with me?
N: A beat. Summer says nothing.
C: TOM
D: And the Priest says, "But we're already out!"
N: They both laugh.
C: SUMMER
D: That is hilarious!
C: TOM
D: I know!
N: And when she walks away, he smacks his head a few times with his palm.
S: INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE
C: TOM
D: Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over.
N: Tom's friends all look at him like he's crazy. (27 & 28)
S: INT OFFICE - TOM'S CUBICLE - DAY
N: Tom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work. But with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard time concentrating. McKenzie shares a cubicle with Tom.
C: MCKENZIE
D: This Friday. 10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well.
C: TOM
D: No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Come on! "Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties!"
E: SINGING
C: TOM
D: They won't let you back in there after last time.
C: MCKENZIE
D: I wasn't that bad.
C: TOM
D: Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you.
C: MCKENZIE
D: You saved my life that day.
E: REVERENTIAL
C: TOM
D: We are not going back there.
C: MCKENZIE
D: This is a work thing, Tommy. It won't be like that. The whole office is going.
C: TOM
D: I really can't. Even if I wanted to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta take care of.
C: MCKENZIE
D: You're not listening to me.
C: TOM
D: What?
C: MCKENZIE
D: The whole office is going. Tom looks over to where Summer sits. And realization dawns on him...
S: INT KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
N: Summer is in a back booth with some co-workers when Tom walks in to the crowded place. McKenzie has the microphone and he's singing "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison. He's real into it and, well, it's kinda sad. Tom waves to McKenzie and walks over to the booth.
C: TOM
D: Hi.
C: SUMMER
D: Hey! They said you weren't coming.
C: TOM
D: You asked if I was coming? I mean...my plans got cancelled...
E: BEAT
N: Tom is at a loss. There's yet another awkward silent beat between them. Thankfully, it's interrupted by...
C: MCKENZIE
D: Goddamn that song is brilliant! What's up Hansen?
E: already drunk
N: Summer sees the next song come up on the screen.
C: SUMMER
D: Ooh that's me.
N: She downs a shot and jumps up on stage.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok. I'm the new girl so no making fun of me.
E: into mic
N: Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a midget in a tuxedo.) LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as Summer chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can't help but stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles, hopeful that she'll come over. She doesn't. He hides his disappointment. LATER. Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is there in mid-conversation with McKenzie.
C: TOM
D: You were great up there, by the way.
C: SUMMER
D: Well you can't go wrong with The Boss.
C: TOM
D: I hear that.
E: sitting down
C: MCKENZIE
D: Hey, did you know Tom here's from Jersey?
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah?
C: TOM
D: Lived there til I was 12.
C: SUMMER
D: I named my cat after Springsteen.
C: TOM
D: No kidding? What's his name?
C: SUMMER
D: Bruce.
C: TOM
D: That makes sense.
E: BEAT
N: She laughs. She's really cute when she laughs.
C: MCKENZIE
D: So you got a boyfriend?
C: SUMMER
D: Me? No.
N: Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment. McKenzie mouths "what?" Summer sees nothing.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Why not?
C: SUMMER
D: Don't really want one.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Come on. I don't believe that.
C: SUMMER
D: You don't believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Are you a lesbian?
E: BEAT
C: SUMMER
D: No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not comfortable being somebody's "girlfriend." I don't want to be anybody's anything, you know?
C: MCKENZIE
D: I have no idea what you're talking about.
C: SUMMER
D: It sounds selfish, I know, but... I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
E: MORE
N: SUMMER (cont'd) I say, let's have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later.
C: TOM
D: But...what if you meet someone and fall in love?
C: SUMMER
D: Love? You seriously believe in that stuff?
E: LAUGHS
C: TOM
D: Of course I do.
C: SUMMER
D: Interesting. A real romantic.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Oh you have no idea. This one... embarrassing. There was this one girl, I gotta tell this story --
E: to Tom
N: Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.
C: TOM
D: Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love?
C: SUMMER
D: I don't even know what that word means. I know I've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents.
C: TOM
D: Well mine too but --
C: SUMMER
D: Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in "love" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about?
C: TOM
D: Well...
C: SUMMER
D: Why, what's your take on it?
T: CUT TO:
N: AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO. BACK TO:
S: INT BAR
N: On Tom:
C: TOM
D: I think it's...kind of a huge thing.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.
E: BEAT
N: McKenzie senses some discontent.
C: MCKENZIE
D: So, uh, who's singing next?
C: SUMMER
D: I'd say it's your turn loverboy.
E: re: singing
C: TOM
D: Nooo. I don't sing in public.
C: SUMMER
D: Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in.
C: TOM
D: I don't...
C: MCKENZIE
D: You really do.
C: SUMMER
D: It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Self-confidence! Ha!
E: can't help himself
N: Tom elbows him in the ribs again.
C: TOM
D: Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok then. Let's drink.
C: TOM
D: It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing.
C: SUMMER
D: Bartender!
N: TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's "Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts. It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching. LATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming something.
C: TOM
D: That's not it.
C: SUMMER
D: What is that then?
C: TOM
D: I have no idea.
N: They're both having a good time.
C: SUMMER
D: I used to watch it every week.
C: TOM
D: Me too. Why can't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song.
C: SUMMER
D: Pathetic.
C: TOM
D: This is gonna bother me for weeks.
C: SUMMER
D: Totally.
N: They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good way. ANGLE ON McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "Proud to Be an American." He really means it. At any minute he might start to cry.
C: MCKENZIE
D: "And I'd proudly stand UP!" I said stand!
E: aggressive drunk
N: BACK ON TOM and SUMMER.
C: TOM
D: Oh here we go.
S: EXT KARAOKE BAR - LATER
N: Tom helps a nearly comatose McKenzie exit the place. Summer is with them.
C: MCKENZIE
D: This guy. He's the best.
E: to Summer DRAMATICALLY
C: TOM
D: Ok, let's get you in a cab.
C: MCKENZIE
D: No. I'm gonna walk. I live right down that street. Or that one.
C: SUMMER
D: Is he gonna be ok?
E: LAUGHING
C: TOM
D: He'll be fine.
N: A cab arrives. Tom and Summer help McKenzie inside.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Hey.
C: TOM
D: What's up?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Not you. You. He likes you.
E: beat, to Summer
C: TOM
D: Ok, goodnight McKenzie!
E: QUICKLY
C: MCKENZIE
D: I mean... likes you, likes you. For real. Tell her Tom.
N: Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it's just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.
C: TOM
D: Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It's unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don't know. But at least he didn't --
C: SUMMER
D: Is that true?
C: TOM
D: What?
C: SUMMER
D: You know what. Do you...like me?
C: TOM
D: Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.
C: SUMMER
D: As a friend.
C: TOM
D: Right. As a friend.
C: SUMMER
D: Just as a friend?
N: The wheels are spinning in Tom's head. What's the right answer here?
C: TOM
D: Yes. I mean... I haven't really thought about... Yes. Why?
C: SUMMER
D: Nothing. I just... You're interesting. I'd like us to be friends. Is that ok?
N: Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He hides his disappointment the best he can.
C: TOM
D: Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That's... perfect.
C: SUMMER
D: Cool.
C: TOM
D: Cool.
N: Silence.
C: SUMMER
D: Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.
C: TOM
D: G'night Summer.
N: Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way.
C: TOM
D: Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.
E: under his breath
N: Tom walks a few more steps. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED HIM INTO A KISS! It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually happening. FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
S: EXT STREET - MORNING
N: It's the greatest morning of all time! Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes, winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back. People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up. A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom singing the song. Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean". CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at them.
S: INT OFFICE - SAME
N: Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees him and immediately lights up.
C: SUMMER
D: Hey!
C: TOM
D: Hey!
N: Vance pokes out of his corner office.
C: VANCE.
D: Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen.
C: TOM
D: Hey Mr. Vance.
C: SUMMER
D: Yes, Mr. Vance?
N: And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it. Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.
S: INT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT
N: Tom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs).
C: PAUL
D: You son of a bitch.
N: He walks inside without waiting for an invite.
C: PAUL
D: Last night, karaoke night?
C: TOM
D: Shhh.
E: ANXIOUS
C: PAUL
D: The same girl you'd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now?
C: TOM
D: I have not been...
C: PAUL
D: The same girl you said was way out of your league and you'd have no chance with no matter what. That girl?
C: TOM
D: Paul, seriously...
C: PAUL
D: Did you bang her?
C: TOM
D: No!
C: PAUL
D: Blow job?
C: TOM
D: No!
C: PAUL
D: Hand job?
C: TOM
D: No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed.
C: PAUL
D: Come on, level with me. As your best friend, who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl, nothing but Summer this, Summer that, Summer Summer Summer, I mean you were practically stalking her...
C: TOM
D: Shhh!
N: Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out.
C: PAUL
D: Oh crap.
C: SUMMER
D: Hi, I'm Summer..
C: PAUL
D: Summer, wow what an unusual name. I'm sure I'd remember that if I had heard it before. Tom, how come you've never mentioned you knew such a lovely little lady? Or perhaps you have and I've just forgot. I mean, with all the women in Tom's life it's hard to keep track... Ok, well, I was just... I'm Paul.
E: off Tom's nasty look to Summer not helping
C: SUMMER
D: Hi Paul.
C: PAUL
D: (not sure what else to
C: SAY)
D: I'm a doctor.
C: SUMMER
D: Nice to meet you.
C: PAUL
D: Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I was never here. Tom, talk to you later?... Hey, If any jobs open up...
N: Tom quickly shuts the door on Paul.
C: TOM
D: If you heard...
C: SUMMER
D: Heard what?
C: TOM
D: Excellent. You ready to go.
C: SUMMER
D: I'm stalking, STARVING!
N: Tom realizes she's heard it all.
C: TOM
D: He exaggerates!
E: PLAYFULLY
S: INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Tom and Summer eating, not really talking much. At another table, Tom sees a VERY UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE feeding each other food.
C: TOM
D: Check them out.
N: Summer sees. She has no reaction.
C: TOM
D: That is hot.
E: SARCASTIC
N: Summer keeps eating.
C: TOM
D: I am very turned on right now.
C: SUMMER
D: Sometimes you can be so judgmental.
C: TOM
D: Huh?
C: SUMMER
D: I mean, who are you? They're happy. Just mind your own business.
N: Summer goes back to eating. Tom can't believe she snapped.
S: INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: An equally UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE go at it in a booth. PAN ACROSS to find Tom and Summer early in their relationship, in a booth across the room, watching in hysterics.
C: TOM
D: 9, 9.5?
C: SUMMER
D: Too soon to say. It's all in the dismount.
C: TOM
D: If we're lucky, there won't be a dismount.
N: Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it again. They are having a great night.
C: SUMMER
D: I can't believe them. I have like zero patience for PDA.
C: TOM
D: I hear ya. If I want to watch people make out, I have big windows and binoculars at home.
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah?
C: TOM
D: No. That would be wrong.
E: BEAT
N: They laugh some more. She is in hysterics.
C: SUMMER
D: This is fun. You're fun.
C: TOM
D: Thanks.
C: SUMMER
D: I mean, I just want to say, up front, I'm not looking for anything serious.
N: Tom is a little surprised.
C: SUMMER
D: Are you cool with that?
C: TOM
D: Sure.
E: UNCONVINCING
C: SUMMER
D: It freaks some guys out when I say that.
C: TOM
D: Not me.
E: still confused
C: SUMMER
D: Let's just have fun. Let's just...hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations. Ok?
E: BEAT
N: Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it.
C: TOM
D: Sure.
C: SUMMER
D: Wanna hold my hand under the table?
E: BEAT
N: A beat.
C: TOM
D: Yeah.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Summer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other. Suddenly, Tom stops.
C: TOM
D: I'll be...back in a sec.
N: He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into the hallway mirror.
C: TOM
D: Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself.
N: He takes a few deep breaths.
C: TOM
D: Are you calm? Ok. Then it's time to go back in.
E: BEAT
N: We watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom. Where Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked.
C: SUMMER
D: Hi.
C: TOM
D: Oh sweet Jesus!
N: Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance.
T: CUT TO:
N: LATER. Sex has been had. Summer is asleep. Tom lies next to her. He still can't help but be ecstatic. He is pumping his fists in the air and silently shouting "Woo Hoo!!!!" CU - TOM. LOOKING THE WORSE FOR WEAR. UNSHAVEN, LONG HAIR, CRUMPLED CLOTHING. IN SHORT, HE'S A MESS.
C: TOM
D: I fucking hate Summer.
E: into CAMERA
N: CU - SUMMER'S SMILE (as before)
C: TOM
D: I hate her crooked teeth.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER'S HAIR (as before)
C: TOM
D: I hate her 1950s haircut.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER'S KNEES (as before)
C: TOM
D: I hate her knobby knees.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER'S EYES (as before)
C: TOM
D: I hate her lopsided, asymmetrical, cock-eyed head.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER'S NECK (as before)
C: TOM
D: I hate that centipede-shaped scar.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER'S BREASTS (as before)
C: TOM
D: I hate her...stupid...big boobs.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER ASLEEP (as before)
C: TOM
D: I hate the way she sleeps.
E: V.O.
N: CU - SUMMER'S LAUGH
C: TOM
D: I hate the way she laughs.
E: V.O.
N: OVER BLACK, play the middle 8 of "Every Little Thing She Does is Magic."
C: TOM
D: I HATE THIS FUCKING SONG!
E: V.O.
N: CU - TOM. REVERSE ANGLE on A TROLLEY FULL OF PEOPLE, terrified of this raving lunatic.
C: BUS DRIVER
D: Son, you're gonna have to exit the vehicle.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT OFFICE - DAY
N: Tom passes Summer's desk. A new SECRETARY sits there. He notices, in the trash, a reprint of an avant garde surrealist painting of two dogs humping. He stops and retrieves it from the bin like it's some family heirloom. He gives the secretary a dirty look for tossing it.
S: INT. SF MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY
N: CU: the same painting. ANGLE ON Summer and Tom looking at it curiously.
C: TOM
D: It's very... complex.
C: SUMMER
D: Complex. Yes.
N: CU: a second painting which is nothing but red. ANGLE ON Summer and Tom looking at it with the same expressions.
C: SUMMER
D: In a way, it speaks so much by saying... so little.
C: TOM
D: I feel the same way.
N: CU: a third painting which could only be, well, poop. ANGLE ON Summer and Tom, still perplexed but trying. They say nothing, until:
C: TOM
D: You wanna go to the movies?
C: SUMMER
D: God yes!
E: RELIEVED
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATER - LATER
N: The marquee reads "Part Vampire. Part Giant. `VAGIANT!'"
S: INT. MOVIE THEATER - CONT.
N: The theater is packed. Everyone is laughing and screaming and throwing popcorn. Tom and Summer are having a great time.
S: EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - DAY
N: Summer and Tom stand on San Francisco's most interesting street corner, where the ultra-modern Transamerica Building stands next to the ancient Columbus Tower.
C: TOM
D: A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.
S: EXT PALACE OF FINE ARTS - DAY
N: Summer and Tom in front of the famed Roman-style structure.
C: TOM
D: The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God.
S: EXT YERNA BUENA GARDEN - DAY
N: Summer and Tom sit on the steps which offers a stunning view of the city's architectural marvels.
C: TOM
D: It just makes you feel... peaceful.
N: They really do seem at peace.
S: EXT SONY METREON - DAY
N: Tom and Summer in front of the gargantuan mirrored building.
C: TOM
D: No. See now, this is torture.
C: SUMMER
D: Why?
C: TOM
D: Over there, that's St. Patrick's church. The beauty of St. Patrick's is its humility. With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble. No one even knows it's there.
C: SUMMER
D: How would you change it?
C: TOM
D: There's a million things. First, there's no need for this much glass. You could easily...
C: SUMMER
D: Show me.
C: TOM
D: What?
C: SUMMER
D: Don't talk about it. Do it.
N: Summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of her arm. Tom thinks about this. Then he starts to draw a sketch on her skin. We catch her watching his face as he draws. She's attracted to his enthusiasm.
C: TOM
D: See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so...
S: EXT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
N: Tom and Summer, who have ridden together to work, stand outside the building.
C: SUMMER
D: You wanna --
C: TOM
D: No you go first.
C: SUMMER
D: It doesn't matter to me.
C: TOM
D: Whatever you want.
N: A CO-WORKER passes.
C: CO-WORKER
D: Hey Summer. Tom.
C: BOTH
D: Hey./ Hi.
E: like nothing's up
N: Summer joins the co-worker and walks in.
C: SUMMER
D: So how's it going?
E: to Co-Worker
N: She turns back to look at Tom on the way. She sticks out her tongue to be cute. Co-Worker doesn't see. Tom is crazy about her.
S: INT OFFICE - LATER
N: Tom at his cubicle with the one architecture sketch. The phone rings and he picks it up.
C: TOM
D: Hello?
C: SUMMER
D: I remember!
E: V.O.
S: INT COPY ROOM - DAY
N: Summer is on her cell phone in the office copy room. She begins to sing the theme song to "The A-Team."
C: TOM
D: That's it!
E: V.O.
N: McKenzie enters and sees her singing into the phone. Turns without a word and leaves.
S: INT TOM'S CUBICLE - SAME
N: Tom listening to her sing. McKenzie comes over.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Your girl is losing it.
N: Tom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him. The smile on his face is the biggest we've seen yet.
S: INT. SHOWER - LATER
N: We just see the curtain, but we can see their silhouettes behind it. Summer and Tom are trying to have sex in the shower. They're trying to stable themselves, grip something so as not to fall, elbows are flying, it's a mess.
C: SUMMER
D: This is not at all as easy as it looks.
C: TOM
D: Ow!
N: The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down. They fall on top of each other laughing.
S: INT VIRGIN MEGASTORE - NIGHT
N: Tom and Summer wander through the aisles.
C: TOM
D: There's no way.
C: SUMMER
D: Why not?
C: TOM
D: "Octopus's Garden?" You may as well just say "Piggies?"
C: SUMMER
D: I told you. I love Ringo.
C: TOM
D: You're insane.
C: SUMMER
D: Why?
C: TOM
D: Cause nobody loves Ringo.
C: SUMMER
D: That's what I love about him. Ooh.
E: BEAT
N: Summer drags Tom into the curtained-off "Porn" section. She picks up a box.
C: SUMMER
D: This got great reviews.
E: FLIRTATIOUS
S: INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Tom and Summer get comfortable. Both are excited and looking forward to this. The movie starts, the credits roll. Tom and Summer start to make out a bit, both keeping an eye on the TV.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - 20 MINUTES LATER
N: Tom and Summer, watching the movie. Intently. They've even got popcorn.
C: SUMMER
D: Is that... possible?
S: INT SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
N: Tom, Mckenzie and Paul are having a drink.
C: PAUL
D: So what's going on with you and Summer?
C: TOM
D: I don't know.
C: PAUL
D: Is she your girlfriend?
C: TOM
D: I wouldn't say that.
C: MCKENZIE
D: What would you say?
C: TOM
D: Like, are we "going steady?" Come on, guys. We're adults.
C: PAUL
D: It's not an unreasonable question. Watch. McKenzie, do you have a girlfriend?
C: MCKENZIE
D: No I do not. In fact girls are repulsed by me. Paul, how about you?
C: PAUL
D: Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.
C: TOM
D: It is when you've been with the same girl since high school.
C: PAUL
D: You've been "seeing" this girl, what, two months now?
C: TOM
D: Something like that.
C: PAUL
D: And you haven't discussed it?
C: TOM
D: No! She's not... We're not like that.
C: PAUL
D: Like what?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Normal.
C: TOM
D: We've just been... hanging out.
C: PAUL
D: Hanging out?!
C: TOM
D: Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we know how we feel. We don't need to label it. "Boyfriend, girlfriend." That stuff is very... juvenile.
N: Beat.
C: MCKENZIE
D: You're so gay.
C: PAUL
D: Well let me ask you this then. Do you want her to be your girlfriend?
N: Tom takes a second to think about this.
C: TOM
D: I don't know... Maybe.
C: MCKENZIE
D: I heard her Hansen. She's not the girlfriend type. You're gonna need to discuss it.
C: TOM
D: No. We're adults. It'll be fine.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Have you made her a CD yet?
C: TOM
D: Maybe.
E: BEAT
C: MCKENZIE
D: Oh dude.
C: PAUL
D: You really need to have that talk.
S: EXT FIELD - DAY
N: Rachel is playing field hockey on the 7th grade team. Tom is watching from behind the players' bench. A whistle blows and Rachel comes back and sits down.
C: RACHEL
D: You were saying?
C: TOM
D: My thinking is... why rock the boat? Things are going well. If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. Like saying to a girl "I love you."
C: RACHEL
D: I know what you mean. That's what happened with me and Sean.
C: TOM
D: Who the hell's Sean?
C: RACHEL
D: My boyfriend before Mark.
C: TOM
D: Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice.
C: RACHEL
D: I'm 12.
C: TOM
D: Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble.
C: RACHEL
D: Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right?
C: TOM
D: Something like that.
E: BEAT
C: RACHEL
D: Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse to get the wrong answer now... or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway?
C: TOM
D: Who's Lars?
C: RACHEL
D: He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.
C: TOM
D: That son of a bitch.
C: RACHEL
D: You see what I mean?
N: The whistle blows again and Rachel gets up to go back on the field.
C: RACHEL
D: Later dude.
C: TOM
D: Coach, no, wait! I need her. Rachel, what do you think I should do?
E: shouting to Rachel
C: RACHEL
D: Just don't be a pussy.
E: calling back
N: On Tom, we:
T: CUT TO:
S: INT TOM'S CAR - THAT NIGHT
N: Tom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very conflicted and we can see it in his face. They're silent a few beats, before:
C: SUMMER
D: Hi.
C: TOM
D: Hi.
C: SUMMER
D: Are you ok?
C: TOM
D: Yeah.
C: SUMMER
D: You sure?
N: He's not. He clenches his teeth. And begins...
C: TOM
D: Summer, I've gotta ask you something.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok.
N: He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when:
C: SUMMER
D: Wait!
N: Summer finds on the radio a particular song. ("Waiting in Vain" by Bob Marley, if you must know.)
C: SUMMER
D: Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too beautiful.
N: And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl. Marley sings:
C: B.M.
D: "In life I know there's lots of grief/ but your love is my relief."
N: We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight.
S: INT PARTY - NIGHT
N: Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party. TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with, drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention they're getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that attention.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
N: Tom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the titles. He grabs just about every one of them.
S: INT. APARTMENT - LATER
N: Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his bed. He reads from one called "Six Steps to Getting Over Him."
C: TOM
D: "So he broke your heart. You've been sad and depressed for weeks. Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs. And nothing's helped. Now what? Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day?"
E: V.O.
N: SECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He continues to read.
C: TOM
D: "No you should not."
E: V.O.
N: He slowly puts the ice cream down.
C: TOM
D: "Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill. Those steps are:"
E: V.O.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Tom jogs.
C: TOM
D: "One. Exercise. The body's release of endorphins will assuage the brain and provide a genuine sense of accomplishment and success."
E: V.O.
N: Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in place.
S: INT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT
N: Tom is taking a yoga class.
C: TOM
D: "Two. Physical and Mental relaxation. Channel all of your energies to the core of your being for a new understanding of the self and others."
E: V.O.
N: This shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't even get the breathing right.
S: INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY
N: Tom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the homeless.
C: TOM
D: "Three. Charity. Reach out! You are not alone in your pain."
E: V.O.
N: Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other.
S: INT SHOE STORE - DAY
N: Tom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store.
C: TOM
D: "Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you know you want to. Indulge!"
E: V.O.
N: ANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't really want new shoes.
S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
N: Tom backpacks alone in the forest.
C: TOM
D: "Five. Travel. Take some time to see another environment. Get perspective. It's a beautiful world. It will be for you again someday."
E: V.O.
N: This is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and takes a deep breath. FREEZE ON TOM. INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER has Tom sized up in his rifle sight. UNFREEZE. Tom starts to itch...
S: INT. APARTMENT - LATER
N: Tom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment.
C: TOM
D: "Six. Redecorate. Start anew."
E: V.O.
N: He's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it.
C: TOM
D: "By taking these few steps, you will have discovered your inner strength and should be ready to move on. I bet you can hardly remember his face at all."
E: V.O.
N: We pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and dropkicks it.
S: INT CROWDED BAR - NIGHT
N: Summer and Tom stand by the bar.
C: TOM
D: I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me.
C: SUMMER
D: People think it looks good.
C: TOM
D: Do you?
C: SUMMER
D: On some.
C: TOM
D: I like how you dress.
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg?
C: TOM
D: Please don't.
E: BEAT
N: A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly appeared next to them.
C: DOUCHE
D: Hey.
E: to Summer
N: Tom and Summer stop talking.
C: SUMMER
D: Hey.
C: DOUCHE
D: How's it going?
C: SUMMER
D: Ok.
N: Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more amused than concerned.
C: DOUCHE
D: You live around here?
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah not too far.
C: DOUCHE
D: I've never seen you here before.
C: SUMMER
D: You're not too perceptive.
C: DOUCHE
D: Ha. That's funny.
N: Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry about.
C: DOUCHE
D: So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
C: SUMMER
D: No thank you.
N: As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of them together.
C: DOUCHE
D: Are you with this guy?
N: Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.
C: TOM
D: Hi. I'm Tom.
E: BEAT
C: DOUCHE
D: Whatever. Come on, one drink. What are you drinking?
E: to Summer
C: SUMMER
D: Sorry, no thank you.
N: Tom is pleased.
C: DOUCHE
D: You're serious? This guy?
N: And now he's pissed.
C: TOM
D: Hey buddy --
C: SUMMER
D: Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok?
E: to the Douche
C: DOUCHE
D: It's a free country.
N: Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now what?" After a beat:
C: DOUCHE
D: So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend?
N: And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE. Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling. Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's fist). There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised. And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it.
C: TOM
D: Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt.
N: Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first time she's furious.
C: TOM
D: Hey. What is it?
C: SUMMER
D: I can't believe you.
C: TOM
D: What?
C: SUMMER
D: You were so completely uncool in there.
C: TOM
D: You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.
C: SUMMER
D: Oh that was for me? You were, what, protecting me? Next time Tommy, don't. I fight my own battles.
C: TOM
D: Come on, that guy was an asshole!
C: SUMMER
D: You didn't have to hit him. Why didn't you just let me handle it?
C: TOM
D: I don't know. He was --
C: SUMMER
D: See. This is why I don't want a serious relationship.
C: TOM
D: Whoa. What was that?
C: SUMMER
D: Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I like this. What we've been doing. But maybe it's gone too...
C: TOM
D: What...?
C: SUMMER
D: I told you all along what I don't want and it's...
N: Tom waits for more. It doesn't come.
C: SUMMER
D: I'm tired. Can we talk about this tomorrow?
N: It's silent. He doesn't know what to do or say or think. Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways.
C: TOM
D: I just got my ass kicked!
E: calling to her
N: Only the CROWD outside the bar hear this.
C: TOM
D: I got one good shot in.
E: to Onlookers
N: (146 & 147)
S: INT. OFFICE - LATER
N: Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose. Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there. She stops short.
C: TOM
D: Hi.
E: GENUINE
C: SUMMER
D: Hi.
E: COLD
C: TOM
D: What's up?
C: SUMMER
D: Nothing.
C: TOM
D: Ok.
N: Nothing else is said.
C: TOM
D: Wait, are you still mad at me?
C: SUMMER
D: Tom...
E: rolling her eyes
C: TOM
D: Holy shit you are. I can't believe you!
C: SUMMER
D: Are you almost done?
E: re: copies
C: TOM
D: Yeah. I'm all done.
N: He starts to walk out.
C: TOM
D: You know what... Sometimes you really don't make any sense.
N: Tom walks out. He looks back but she isn't looking. When she looks back at him, he's gone. LATER. Tom about to leave the office. Passes Summer's desk. She's on the phone. He wants to stop and say something but she's busy. He walks on. She never knew he was there. LATER. Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle but he's already gone.
S: SPLITSCREEN - INT. BOTH APARTMENTS - THAT NIGHT
N: Left: Tom tosses and turns in his sleep. Right: Summer lies awake, staring at the ceiling. Left: Tom picks up the phone. Is about to dial when he stops himself and hangs up. Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring. It doesn't.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER
N: Tom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the "sleep" button but the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm. It's his door. He gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer.
C: SUMMER
D: Say you're sorry.
C: TOM
D: Huh?
C: SUMMER
D: Say you're sorry for acting like a jerk.
C: TOM
D: I am. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok. Me too.
C: TOM
D: Summer... we don't have to label what we're doing. I just... I need -
C: SUMMER
D: I know -
C: TOM
D: Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way.
C: SUMMER
D: I can't promise you that. Nobody can. Anyone who does is a liar.
N: A beat.
C: SUMMER
D: I can only tell you how I feel right now... or I can show you.
N: She comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second. Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins again. He shuts the door in our faces.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
N: Tom and Summer in the wee hours.
C: TOM
D: Have you ever had a real "boyfriend?"
C: SUMMER
D: What?
C: TOM
D: A boyfriend. "Going steady." Whatever. You know what I mean.
C: SUMMER
D: Well... yeah.
C: TOM
D: More than one?
C: SUMMER
D: A few.
C: TOM
D: Tell me about them.
C: SUMMER
D: Oh no way.
C: TOM
D: Why?
C: SUMMER
D: Cause there's nothing to tell.
C: TOM
D: Come on, I'm interested.
C: SUMMER
D: You wanna have the relationship history conversation?
C: TOM
D: Yes.
C: SUMMER
D: You sure about that?
C: TOM
D: No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok. Well, in high school, there was Markus.
N: INSERT: Still photograph of MARKUS. Or at least how he appears in Tom's mind. Arm cocked, about to throw the winning touchdown pass.
C: TOM
D: Quarterback slash homecoming king?
C: SUMMER
D: He was a rower. Very hot.
C: TOM
D: What happened to Markus?
C: SUMMER
D: He works for the Republican party. Very successful. Just not for me.
C: TOM
D: Ok. And then?
C: SUMMER
D: Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt.
N: INSERT: Still photograph of KURT. As Tom envisions him. Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue.
C: SUMMER
D: That didn't really go anywhere. And... my semester in Rome. Daniele Belardelli. AKA "The Puma."
E: BEAT
N: INSERT: Still photograph of THE PUMA. A swarthy Italian posing in front of a Vespa moped in tight Gucci pants, his boner clearly trying to escape.
C: TOM
D: The Puma?
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah, cause, you know...
N: Tom has no idea. And he doesn't want to know.
C: TOM
D: And that's it?
C: SUMMER
D: The ones that lasted.
C: TOM
D: What happened? Why didn't they work out?
C: SUMMER
D: Nothing happened really. It's what always happens. Life.
N: On TOM. Silent for a few beats. Did he want to hear that?
T: CUT TO:
N: (290S)
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Tom, unshaven, un-showered, walks by himself. He turns a corner and sees Summer walking towards him. As she gets closer he sees it's not her after all and breathes a sigh of relief.
S: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
N: Tom watches TV. An advertisement for toothpaste comes on. Tom could swear the actress was Summer.
S: INT TROLLEY - DAY
N: A trolley going the other direction passes by. EVERY PASSENGER ON IT IS SUMMER. Tom is a fucking mess.
S: EXT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Tom and an attractive girl we haven't seen before walk towards an outdoor cafe. Her name is ALLISON. It's clear right away that Tom can't wait for this night to end already.
C: ALISON
D: So how long have you known Paul and Robyn?
C: TOM
D: Since grade school.
C: ALISON
D: No way, really? That's crazy.
C: TOM
D: Yeah.
C: ALISON
D: Well I'm glad you called. They spoke very highly of you.
C: TOM
D: Great.
S: INT RESTAURANT - LATER
N: Tom and Alison eat. In silence.
C: ALISON
D: So...uh... how's it going?
C: TOM
D: Ok.
N: Beat.
C: ALISON
D: You've been pretty quiet.
C: TOM
D: Sorry.
C: ALISON
D: I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything, you know?
C: TOM
D: Uh-huh.
N: More silence.
C: ALISON
D: Do you want to try some --
C: TOM
D: No thanks.
N: Alison looks at her food. Tom realizes he's been difficult, starts to feel kinda bad.
C: TOM
D: I'm sorry. It's just... there's this girl.
C: ALISON
D: Oh.
C: TOM
D: I'm not usually like this. I wasn't before... Long story short, she wrecked me. I don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I'm still kinda thinking about her.
C: ALISON
D: Well maybe you should think about... someone else... who could cheer you up.
E: DISAPPOINTED
C: TOM
D: I can't get her out of my head, you know? I see her everywhere. She's all I think about. And it's horrible. Cause I totally didn't see it coming. I thought things were fine. So now I keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. Wondering. What went wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have prevented it somehow?
S: EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - (BACK ON DAY 51)
N: Summer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the buildings.
C: TOM
D: A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.
N: Tom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the CAMERA.
C: SUMMER
D: While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, I'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire I am.
S: INT RESTAURANT - SAME
N: Tom and Alison.
C: TOM
D: Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know?
S: INT SUMMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - (FROM DAY 39)
N: From the scene in which Tom and Summer first slept together. He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had in a long while. Summer lies next to him. Wide awake. Bored and unfulfilled.
S: INT RESTAURANT - SAME
N: Tom and Alison. Alison is desperately trying to get a drink.
C: ALISON
D: Waiter!
C: TOM
D: Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with.
S: INT ELEVATOR - DAY - (FROM DAY 22)
N: Tom and Summer ride in silence for a few beats.
C: TOM
D: How was your weekend?
E: BEAT
C: SUMMER
D: It was good.
E: winks at him
S: INT RESTAURANT - SAME
C: TOM
D: Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why.
C: ALISON
D: It's ok. I'm sure it's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend.
C: TOM
D: Actually she was never my girlfriend.
N: Now Alison is really confused. And it's right around the part where Tom starts totally cracking up.
C: TOM
D: I just... I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is... When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird?
C: ALISON
D: You were in love, that's what it does. But, now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them.
C: TOM
D: Sure. Hey, I've been talking non-stop. You talk.
E: BEAT
C: ALISON
D: Me? Well I grew up --
C: TOM
D: So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now?
C: ALISON I...
E: BEAT MORE
N: ALISON (cont'd) You wanna get out of here? I know this great...
C: TOM
D: Oh! You know what we should do...
E: suddenly excited
S: INT KARAOKE BAR - LATER
N: Tom is, yes, on stage singing another song by The Clash, "Train in Vain." Not so much singing as having a nervous breakdown to music.
C: TOM
D: "You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped!
N: Alison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face.
C: TOM
D: "You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me," I'm talking about you Summer!
N: On Alison, having the worst date ever.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT TOM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out. A punkish pop song plays in the b.g. that he occasionally boogies down to. He's excited. He tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into the mirror. Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street.
S: EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - SAME
N: Tom walking in the Spring air, feeling good. The phone rings.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT SUMMER'S APARTMENT - SAME
N: Summer on the cell as she enters her apartment. She looks like she's coming back from the gym.
C: SUMMER
D: Hey it's me.
C: TOM
D: Hello me. You having a good day?
C: SUMMER
D: I am thank you. Listen, about tonight... I think I might just stay in and go to bed early.
C: TOM
D: What? Why?
C: SUMMER
D: I'm just really tired and I've gotta go in early tomorrow. Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead?
C: TOM
D: Well... You don't want to just, maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've gotta eat right?
C: SUMMER
D: I'm not really that hungry. And this place is fancy right?
C: TOM
D: Sorta.
E: touching his tie
C: SUMMER
D: I'd rather not. Seriously, do you mind?
N: Tom is standing still now, no longer moving. He's trying to keep his frustration from being audible.
C: TOM
D: Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you want to do.
C: SUMMER
D: Thank you. So we'll talk tomorrow, alright?
C: TOM
D: Sure.
C: SUMMER
D: Great. Good night Tom.
C: TOM
D: Good night. Hey, Happy... birthday.
E: BEAT
N: But the line is dead. Tom's head sinks into his chest. Yet another frustrating night...
T: CUT TO:
N: CU PAUL, TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA DOCUMENTARY STYLE
C: PAUL
D: I just got lucky I guess. We met in elementary school. We had the same class schedule in the 7th grade and we just... clicked.
T: CUT TO:
N: CU MCKENZIE.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Love? Shit, I don't know. As long as she's cute and she's willing, right? Actually, cute is a strong word. Not atrocious.
N: CU RACHEL.
C: RACHEL
D: That's a pretty complex question. Philosophers, poets, scientists, everybody has a theory, don't they?
E: MORE
N: RACHEL (cont'd) I kinda like what Nietzsche said: "There is always some madness in love, but there is also...always some reason in madness." Think about it. Pretty smart. Although, Nietzsche also said "Kill the Jews." So there's that. CU VANCE.
C: VANCE.
D: I've been happily married for 30 years. She's the light that guides me home. Yes it is from one of our cards. No someone else wrote it. Doesn't make it less true.
E: BEAT BEAT
N: CU SUMMER
C: SUMMER
D: Ok I'm sick of this love shit. Come on! We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings. And what does it mean? Absolutely nothing. Give me a break!
N: CU MCKENZIE
C: MCKENZIE
D: I'm just saying... I really need some ass. I'm desperate. You got nothing?
E: BEAT
N: CU PAUL
C: PAUL
D: I wouldn't say "the girl of my dreams," no. The girl of my dreams would have a better rack. Probably different hair, could like sports a little more. But... truth is... Robyn's better than the girl of my dreams. You know why? Cause she's real.
E: BEAT
N: CU TOM. He says nothing. Just stands there. So confused. We go right INTO: ANIMATION. A QUICK 5 second recap of the earlier color sequence.
S: INT OFFICE - DAY
N: Tom is wandering through the office whistling.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Hansen, don't you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write?
C: TOM
D: Nope. All done. What are you working on?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Congratulations. But I've run out of ways to say it. "Good job," "well done," "way to go"... I got nothing.
C: TOM
D: Why don't you try... "Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a card."
C: MCKENZIE
D: Shit. That's not bad.
E: BEAT
C: TOM
D: No worries.
N: Tom walks by the room marked "Weddings and Anniversaries." He's about to keep going when he pauses.
S: INT WEDDINGS AND ANNIVERSARIES SUITE - LATER
N: All of the people who work in here are MIDDLE AGED WOMEN. Currently, they are standing around one desk where Tom sits writing everyone's cards.
C: TOM
D: This is good Millie. "To my wife, the love of my life. I love you." That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... "Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete." You know, spice it up a little.
N: The Women clutch their heart like they might faint.
S: INT RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS WING - LATER
N: Workers are again all gathered around Tom.
C: TOM
D: Did you try... "Merry?"
C: ALL
D: Whoa/Perfect/Yes!
C: TOM
D: What else you got?
N: EMPLOYEE #1 Passover. Tom says something totally in Yiddish. No one knows what the hell he just said except for one Employee who bursts out in tears of joy.
S: INT OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER
N: Tom passes Summer at her desk. She waves. He waves back. He's so in love with her.
S: INT ANOTHER WING - LATER
N: ANGLE ON TOM writing furiously at a computer terminal.
C: TOM
D: "...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!" How's that?
E: BEAT
N: The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAHOGANY WRITERS are impressed. MAHOGANY WRITER #1 Something's gotten into you son!
C: TOM
D: Yeah. It's pretty cool.
S: EXT MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
N: Tom and Summer in line to buy tickets.
C: TOM
D: You really want to see this?
C: SUMMER
D: It sounds amazing.
C: TOM
D: It's, like, all stabbing and shit.
C: SUMMER
D: Exactly.
C: TOM
D: Ok.
C: SUMMER
D: All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage.
C: TOM
D: Fantastic.
N: Suddenly, Tom sees something at the front of the line.
C: TOM
D: Oh shit.
C: SUMMER
D: What?
N: And here they come, Tom's mom and step-dad, Sarah and Martin. Tom's face registers a noticeable panic.
C: SARAH
D: Hey!
N: Sarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence. Sarah hugs and kisses her son.
C: TOM
D: Hi Mom.
E: looking at Summer
N: Summer smiles. Maybe this will be ok.
C: TOM
D: Mom, Martin, this is Summer.
C: SARAH
D: Summer! Well hello! We've heard so much about you! It's so good to finally meet you.
N: Sarah hugs Summer.
C: SUMMER
D: You too.
N: And now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices Summer's face growing increasingly concerned. Why is he hugging me?
C: MARTIN
D: Is this the girlfriend?
E: to Tom
N: Tom is caught like a deer in headlights. What can he do?
C: TOM
D: Well this is the girl friend I've told you about. I don't know if "girlfriend" is the right word...
C: SARAH
D: You going to see the serial killer one?
C: SUMMER
D: Yes we are.
C: SARAH
D: Great! Should we save you seats?
N: Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for Summer.
C: SUMMER
D: Absolutely.
C: SARAH
D: Ok. We'll see you inside.
N: When they're out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is distraught.
C: TOM
D: Sorry about that.
C: SUMMER
D: It's fine.
C: TOM
D: You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt.
C: SUMMER
D: Did you tell them I was your girlfriend?
C: TOM
D: What?! No way... I never used that word.
C: SUMMER
D: They seemed to think... I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug?
C: TOM
D: He's very...loving.
C: SUMMER
D: Does he hug all your friends?
N: There's that word again. Summer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the theatre. He's forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as ever. Why is none of this easy?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
N: Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold, emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact, something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie. ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM. It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent, horrible on-screen death.
S: INT CLUB - NIGHT
N: Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.
C: SUMMER
D: You're not having any fun.
C: TOM
D: You're having enough for both of us.
C: SUMMER
D: I'm dancing. I haven't danced in ages. God. Come on.
C: TOM
D: No.
C: SUMMER
D: Come on! I wanna dance with you.
C: TOM
D: Where were you an hour ago? I might have danced then. I've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once.
C: SUMMER
D: So you're pissed?
C: TOM
D: I'm not pissed. Summer... you know I hate this shit.
C: SUMMER
D: Then why are you here?
C: TOM
D: This is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it.
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah well, I didn't need a chaperone. Go home. You're a buzzkill standing there pouting.
C: TOM
D: That's real nice.
E: HURT
N: He walks off. She feels some guilt for a second.
C: SUMMER
D: Tom!
N: But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again. LATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is alone. He can't believe it's come to this. FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
S: EXT STREET - MORNING
N: The worst morning ever. Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad, broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up. He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's brother Clint looks back. Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces. He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He doesn't even stop. Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away. The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for directions. He doesn't even look up. Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks. The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that.
S: INT OFFICE - SAME
N: He passes Summer desk on the way in. She's no longer there. He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends up just staring into space.
S: INT VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Tom has been called into the Principal's office.
C: TOM
D: You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?
C: VANCE
D: Yes Hansen. Sit down.
C: TOM
D: Ok.
C: VANCE.
D: Has something happened to you recently?
C: TOM
D: What do you mean?
C: VANCE
D: A death in the family, someone taken ill...anything like that?
C: TOM
D: No.
C: VANCE
D: Look, I don't mean to pry. Does this have something to do with Summer leaving.
C: TOM
D: Who?
C: VANCE.
D: My assistant.
C: TOM
D: Your...?
E: faking badly
C: VANCE.
D: Tom...everyone knows. Nevermind. The reason I'm asking... lately your work performance has been... a little off.
C: TOM
D: I'm not following.
C: VANCE
D: For example, here's something you wrote last week... (reads from a card on his
C: DESK)
D: "Roses are Red, Violets are Blue. Fuck You Whore." Now...most shoppers on Valentine's Day ---
C: TOM
D: Mr. Vance... are you firing me?
C: VANCE
D: No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You're one of our most... adequate writers.
C: TOM
D: Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult.
C: VANCE
D: That's ok. I understand that. I was just thinking... perhaps you could channel your energy into... this.
N: He hands him some sympathy cards.
C: TOM
D: Funerals and sympathy?
C: VANCE
D: Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live... it's perfect for you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now back to work you go.
N: He quickly ushers him out of the office.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Tom wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls onto the floor and begins a brief push-up routine.
C: NARRATOR
D: Most days of the year are entirely unremarkable. They begin and they end without creating a single lasting memory. Most days have no real impact on the course of a life.
E: V.O.
N: The phone rings. Tom stops his push-ups to answer it.
C: NARRATOR
D: May 8th was a Saturday.
E: V.O.
S: INT DELI - DAY
N: Tom walks in to find Paul and McKenzie at a table. They look extremely nervous.
C: TOM
D: What's going on?
N: Neither one answers him. They look at each other. Finally...
C: PAUL
D: We have news.
C: TOM
D: Ok.
C: MCKENZIE
D: It's about her.
C: TOM
D: Do I want to hear it?
C: PAUL
D: Thats what we wanted to ask you.
C: MCKENZIE
D: It's just...lately you've been...better.
C: PAUL
D: You've been much much better.
C: MCKENZIE
D: So maybe it's best we don't ever bring her up again.
C: PAUL
D: Just let sleeping dogs lie.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Leave those dogs alone Tom!
C: TOM
D: You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate what you're saying and, thank you, really, for putting up with me these past few months. I've been crazy. But I've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do.
N: Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than ever. On Tom, we:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT DELI - SECONDS LATER
N: Tom comes charging out of the place with his friends following behind.
C: TOM
D: There's no fucking way!
C: MCKENZIE
D: Tom.
C: TOM
D: It can't be. It's impossible!
C: PAUL
D: It is.
C: TOM
D: How do you know?
N: On Tom's pained face we...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM
N: Tom is going apeshit in his room. He's ripping down posters, taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He tries to find something to kick and can't. He throws his cell phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM
N: The half-destroyed alarm clock goes off. Tom hits the off button.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM
N: Same exact thing.
S: INT SUPERMARKET - DAY
N: Tom, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, OJ, cigarettes, Jack Daniels, and twinkies. The CLERK eyes him suspiciously.
S: EXT STREET - SAME
N: Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.
C: TOM
D: Jesus Christ people! Get a room!
N: They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM
N: Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see Tom is wide awake. He probably hasn't slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to the alarm.
S: INT OFFICE - LATER
N: Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't muster responses. At his desk,
C: MCKENZIE
D: Tom!
N: Nothing.
C: MCKENZIE
D: I've been calling every five minutes. Are you ok?
C: TOM
D: What? Oh yeah. Great.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Do you need anything?
C: TOM
D: Twinkies?
C: MCKENZIE
D: Sorry.
C: TOM
D: I'm out of twinkies.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Well let's go.
C: TOM
D: Go... where?
C: MCKENZIE
D: It's Thursday.
S: INT BOARDROOM - LATER
N: Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose. A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl."
C: CO-WORKER
D: This one says "Go for it!"
N: She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch."
C: CO-WORKER
D: This one says "Don't give up!"
N: Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap."
C: CO-WORKER
D: And this one says "You can do it!" We have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring Pickles, my cat. I think people will really enjoy them. Thank you.
N: She takes her seat.
C: VANCE.
D: Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really inspirational stuff. Now, who's next. We haven't heard from "Sympathy" in a while. Hansen...
C: TOM
D: Hmm?
E: reacting to his name
C: VANCE.
D: The Winter collection. You have anything to contribute?
C: TOM
D: Uh...no. I really don't.
C: VANCE.
D: You have nothing?
C: TOM
D: Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right.
C: VANCE.
D: Oh...k. We'll come back to you. McKenzie --
E: DISAPPOINTED
C: TOM
D: You know what...?
C: VANCE.
D: Yes Tom.
C: TOM
D: Can I say something about the cat?
C: VANCE
D: Well sure. Go ahead.
C: TOM
D: This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Tom!
C: TOM
D: "Don't give up?" "You can do it?"
N: He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to Leap" image.
C: TOM
D: This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for people.
C: VANCE
D: Hansen, this is a place of business. We don't cut down our co- workers --
C: TOM
D: That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
C: CO-WORKER
D: We're a greeting card company.
E: RHODA
C: TOM
D: Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!
N: Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing uncomfortable.
C: TOM
D: I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this... (picks a card off the
C: TABLE)
D: "I'm sorry to hear your grandmother has passed." What the hell? Let's give em some truth. Something like, "Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Here's a card so I get some credit in your time of need. I'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead."
N: Vance and the card-writing team are appalled.
C: TOM
D: Think about it. "Congratulations on your new baby." Eh... How bout... "Congratulations on your new baby... Guess that's it for hanging out. Nice knowing ya, buddy."
E: picks up another card
C: VANCE
D: Hansen, sit down!
C: TOM
D: Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. "Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you." Oh that's nice.
E: picks up a card
C: MCKENZIE
D: Tom...
C: TOM
D: If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance... I would eat it.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Tom!
N: Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the boardroom table.
C: TOM
D: It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible! Everyone shifts in their seats.
E: BEAT
C: TOM
D: I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... "galoogoo." Yeah I made it up, so what?!
E: BEAT
N: Tom gets up and walks to the door.
C: TOM
D: It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit.
N: And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It doesn't really take.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT BUILDING - MINUTES LATER
N: Tom comes outside with some boxes. He stands out in front of the building. His face says one thing. "Holy shit. Did I just do that?!" And then we,
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT DELI - SAME AS EARLIER
N: Tom and his friends on the sidewalk outside the deli.
C: TOM
D: There's no fucking way!
C: MCKENZIE
D: Tom.
C: TOM
D: It can't be. It's impossible!
C: PAUL
D: It is.
C: TOM
D: How do you know?
C: MCKENZIE
D: We know.
C: TOM
D: But... It's May! We broke up last August.
C: PAUL
D: I know.
C: TOM
D: And you said she was single at Christmas.
C: MCKENZIE
D: She was.
C: TOM
D: And now she's...
C: MCKENZIE
D: Yeah.
C: TOM
D: Now she's getting married.
C: PAUL
D: I'm so sorry Tom.
C: TOM
D: Married?
C: PAUL
D: It's insane.
C: TOM
D: It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know?
C: PAUL
D: No.
C: TOM
D: So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that.
N: His friends say nothing.
C: TOM
D: Fuck!
E: BEAT
N: And with that he storms off.
C: MCKENZIE
D: Tom!
C: PAUL
D: Let him go.
N: ANGLE ON Tom walking away from them. Literally, his entire universe falls apart. FX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to rubble. He's the only constant as the world around him is ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen force and reduced to nothing.
T: CUT TO:
N: BLACK. And we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF "HAVA NAGILA." CU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some old, Tom right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a cult? We are:
S: INT BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: Tom's sister Rachel's Bat Mitzvah. Tom and his family have formed a traditional Hora. They dance in a big circle and clap their hands. A chair is brought to the center and Rachel is lifted high above the circle by Tom, his step-dad, and some others.
T: CUT TO:
N: LATER. Rachel is standing by a cake with a microphone.
C: RACHEL
D: Your apple pies are really great. So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight!
N: ANGLE ON TOM sitting with his mom Sarah at the table. They clap. Mom looks at her son knowing something is wrong. Tom catches her looking.
T: CUT TO:
N: LATER. Tom being accosted by two more Aunts.
C: AUNT ANITA
D: I can't believe that. No girlfriend?
C: TOM
D: I can't believe it either!
C: AUNT BETSY
D: What are you 30? You should be married now. With a family. What are you waiting for?
C: TOM
D: The right girl I guess.
C: AUNT BETSY
D: There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick.
C: TOM
D: Oh you'd be surprised.
C: AUNT ANITA
D: (actually squeezing his
C: CHEEKS)
D: Look at this punum. Are all those girls blind?
C: AUNT BETSY
D: My friend Mimi has a granddaughter. Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out to here --
C: TOM
D: Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was.
C: AUNT ANITA
D: Oh I'm sorry. When was that?
C: TOM
D: July.
C: AUNT BETSY
D: You mean...seven months ago?
C: AUNT ANITA
D: Was it a man?
C: TOM
D: What?
C: AUNT BETSY
D: She's means `are you a homosexual?'
C: TOM
D: No. Where's that coming from?
C: AUNT BETSY
D: We just always wondered.
N: Awkward.
C: AUNT ANITA
D: So how's work?
T: CUT TO:
N: LATER. Tom at the bar. He downs his drink in one gulp.
T: CUT TO:
N: LATER. ANGLE ON Tom alone at the table. The band plays "Lady in Red" and everyone's dancing. When we're back on Tom, he's sitting with Summer.
C: TOM
D: Well...glad you came?
C: SUMMER
D: Of course. Where am I exactly?
C: TOM
D: When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult.
N: ANGLE ON RACHEL, dancing with a BOY.
C: SUMMER
D: Wow. So this is a big day in your sister's life.
C: TOM
D: Pretty big, yeah.
C: SUMMER
D: So why aren't you smiling?
E: BEAT
N: ANGLE ON TOM. Alone. Still not smiling. Rachel arrives in the nick of time.
C: RACHEL
D: Hey brother. Wanna dance?
N: She drags him to the dance floor.
C: RACHEL
D: Hi.
C: TOM
D: You having fun? You were great this morning.
C: RACHEL
D: Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are you?
C: TOM
D: Me? I'm good. I'm great.
C: RACHEL
D: I heard.
E: re: Summer's engagement
C: TOM
D: Yeah.
C: RACHEL
D: Sucks.
C: TOM
D: Yup.
N: It's silent a few beats.
C: TOM
D: Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day.
N: She hugs him. Tight. He doesn't cry but he could.
C: RACHEL
D: You know, my friends... they're all in love with you.
C: TOM
D: Is that right?
C: RACHEL
D: Look.
N: He sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance floor at him.
C: TOM
D: That's nice.
C: RACHEL
D: What I tell ya? There are plenty other fish in the sea.
C: TOM
D: Those are guppies.
C: RACHEL
D: Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your "true love."
C: TOM
D: Are you making fun of me now?
C: RACHEL
D: No I'm serious.
C: TOM
D: I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe.
C: RACHEL
D: Well that's not very romantic.
C: TOM
D: It's the new me.
N: The song ends.
C: TOM
D: Alright... go play with your friends.
C: RACHEL
D: You'll be ok?
C: TOM
D: Sure.
E: LYING
C: RACHEL
D: Tom.
C: TOM
D: Hmm?
C: RACHEL
D: I know you think she was the perfect girl for you... I don't. I think you're just remembering the good stuff. But what do I know, right? I'm 13.
E: BEAT
N: She blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls. Tom watches her go.
T: CUT TO:
N: SPLITSCREEN - TOM'S BEDROOM/ SUMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNING Tom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear.
C: TOM
D: Hey.
N: Summer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her side and she angles towards it.
C: SUMMER
D: Hello?
C: TOM
D: Are you still sleeping?
C: SUMMER
D: I'm getting up. What time is it?
E: GROGGY
C: TOM
D: 10:30. Are we still hanging out today?
C: SUMMER
D: Ok. Sure.
C: TOM
D: I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes?
C: SUMMER
D: I might need 45.
S: EXT PARK - DAY
N: Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar, it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it all, finally, fell apart.
C: TOM
D: So how was last night?
C: SUMMER
D: It was fine. Just a work thing.
C: TOM
D: Where did you guys go?
C: SUMMER
D: Some restaurant.
C: TOM
D: Fun?
C: SUMMER
D: Uneventful. Didn't get home until after 12 though which is way too late for a stupid work function. How was your night?
C: TOM
D: Pretty standard.
N: Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of silence.
S: EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER
N: Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's distant. But only if we're really looking.
S: INT. APARTMENT - LATER
N: Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room. LATER. He hangs some new pictures. LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf. Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something.
S: INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER
N: That day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper. Summer reads a novel.
C: TOM
D: It's playing at 5.
C: SUMMER
D: You want to go?
C: TOM
D: I don't know. You wanna maybe go back to your place or ---
C: SUMMER
D: I want to see it. Let's go.
C: TOM
D: Ok cool.
C: SUMMER
D: Unless you don't want to.
C: TOM
D: No, I will. That's fine.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok.
N: A few more silent beats. Something's in the air.
S: INT MOVIE - LATER
N: Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.
S: INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating. And then he stops. He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit. He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall. From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper, almost shaped like a tear drop.
S: EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
N: Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.
C: TOM
D: Hey.
N: He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs back.
C: TOM
D: Hey Sum, it's just a movie.
C: SUMMER
D: I know. I'm sorry Tom.
C: TOM
D: Is everything alright with you?
N: She smiles, tries to pull herself together.
C: SUMMER
D: Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous.
C: TOM
D: It's ok. This happens to me every time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go for a walk, ok. Let's get some air. Or go to Sister Ray's.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok.
N: They walk.
S: INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT
N: Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles. He grabs one.
C: TOM
D: It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint.
C: SUMMER
D: I've never heard of them.
C: TOM
D: And it's painful. Oh look.
N: He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down the aisles. In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens. It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if there's something to read in that.
S: EXT HARBOR - DAY
N: Tom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the works. He's in the zone.
S: EXT RECORD STORE - LATER
N: Again, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.
C: SUMMER
D: So.
C: TOM
D: So... Now what?
C: SUMMER
D: Now...I think I'm gonna call it a day.
C: TOM
D: Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some dinner or something?
C: SUMMER
D: I've got pasta at home.
C: TOM
D: Are you hungry?
C: SUMMER
D: I'm pretty hungry, but --
C: TOM
D: Ooh!
C: SUMMER
D: What?
C: TOM
D: I've got a great idea!
C: SUMMER
D: What?
C: TOM
D: Let's get breakfast.
C: SUMMER
D: Now?
C: TOM
D: Pancakes?
N: Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is history. FADE UP: "Number Two" by the Pernice Brothers. Which plays OVER:
S: 1. INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable. LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other.
S: 2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
N: Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline.
S: 2. INT LIBRARY - DAY
N: Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building design.
S: 3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
N: Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high-rise.
S: 4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY
N: Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.
S: 6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also crossed off.
S: 5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
N: Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge.
S: 8. EXT PARK - DAY
N: Tom jogs. A little faster this time.
S: 9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost in thought. Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were, he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness. 9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window. Thinking. On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is lifted. And she's a bride. END MUSIC.
S: EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
N: Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took Summer ages ago.
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
C: SUMMER
D: Hey.
E: V.O.
N: Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to do.
C: SUMMER
D: Where you coming from?
E: re: suit
C: TOM
D: What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there?
C: SUMMER
D: Awhile.
N: Tom finds it hard to look at her.
C: SUMMER
D: I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here.
N: The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
C: TOM
D: So... I should probably say congratulations.
C: SUMMER
D: Probably. But only if you mean it.
C: TOM
D: I don't know if I do honestly.
C: SUMMER
D: I understand.
C: TOM
D: Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're happy.
C: SUMMER
D: You really do?
C: TOM
D: God no.
E: BEAT
N: They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
C: SUMMER
D: How are you, Tom?
C: TOM
D: I'm good. Ish.
C: SUMMER
D: That's good.
C: TOM
D: Yeah I quit the office.
C: SUMMER
D: Really? That's great! What are you doing now?
C: TOM
D: Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
N: Awkward silence.
C: TOM
D: So who's the guy?
C: SUMMER
D: Who, my guy?
C: TOM
D: Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.
C: SUMMER
D: Tom...
C: TOM
D: No really, I don't.
C: SUMMER
D: Ok.
N: More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And THEN:
C: TOM
D: It's amazing to me. You're married.
C: SUMMER
D: I know.
C: TOM
D: You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife!
C: SUMMER
D: Pretty crazy, huh?
C: TOM
D: I'll never understand that.
E: SIGHS
C: SUMMER
D: Tom --
C: TOM
D: What's different now? How could things change so quickly?
C: SUMMER
D: I don't know. It just happened.
C: TOM
D: What happened?! That's what I don't get.
C: SUMMER
D: I... Tom...
C: TOM
D: What, tell me...
C: SUMMER
D: I woke up one day and I knew.
N: Tom says nothing.
C: SUMMER
D: I knew I could promise him I'd feel the same way every morning. In a way that I... I never could with you.
N: And there's not much else to say after that. Tom gets up to leave.
C: TOM
D: You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit.
C: SUMMER
D: What is?
C: TOM
D: Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? God!
C: SUMMER
D: Tom, don't go.
C: TOM
D: I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along.
N: Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
C: SUMMER
D: I was right?
N: And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
C: TOM
D: What? This is funny?
N: Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's completely cracking up.
C: TOM
D: What are you laughing at?
N: And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
C: TOM
D: (trying himself not to
C: LAUGH)
D: You're a crazy person!
C: SUMMER
D: Tom! You're the crazy person!
C: TOM
D: What are you talking about?!
C: SUMMER
D: One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband!
C: TOM
D: This is funny to you?
C: SUMMER
D: What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself "Holy shit. Tom was right." You were right about all of it. It just wasn't me you were right about.
E: BEAT
N: Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
C: SUMMER
D: Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I'm glad you're well.
N: Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a SECOND:
C: TOM
D: Summer!
N: She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever.
C: TOM
D: I really do hope you're happy.
C: SUMMER
D: I know. See you later.
E: BEAT
N: And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second.
T: FADE OUT:
N: A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...
T: FADE IN:
S: INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY
N: Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big time. Tom waits. We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
C: GIRL
D: Are you here to interview?
C: TOM
D: Sorry?
C: GIRL
D: Are you interviewing? For the position?
C: TOM
D: Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?
C: GIRL
D: Yup.
C: TOM
D: Ah. My competition.
C: GIRL
D: It would appear.
C: TOM
D: Gee, this is a little awkward.
C: GIRL
D: Yes it is.
C: TOM
D: Well, I hope you don't get it.
C: GIRL
D: I hope you don't get it. They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her. And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
C: TOM
D: So, uh...
C: GIRL
D: Hmm?
C: TOM
D: Are you from...California?
C: GIRL
D: Grew up not too far from here. Atherton, near Stanford.
C: TOM
D: I know Atherton. Nice area.
C: GIRL
D: Have I seen you before?
C: TOM
D: I, uh, don't know. I don't think so.
C: GIRL
D: Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to pray or anything but to stand outside?
C: TOM
D: I do! I love that church. It's like my favorite structure in the city.
C: GIRL
D: If only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing...
C: TOM
D: Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
C: GIRL
D: Yeah. I think I've seen you there.
E: BEAT
C: TOM
D: You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see you.
C: GIRL
D: It happens. You probably weren't looking.
N: A MAN comes out.
C: MAN
D: Tom Hansen?
C: TOM
D: Yes.
C: MAN
D: Come on back.
C: TOM
D: Thank you.
N: He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses and looks back at the girl.
C: NARRATOR
D: If Tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence. That's all anything ever is. Nothing more than coincidence.
N: ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast. Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
C: NARRATOR
D: It took a long time but Tom had finally learned. There are no miracles. There's no such thing as fate. Nothing is meant to be. He knew. He was sure of it now. Tom was...
E: BEAT
N: Tom turns back around.
C: NARRATOR
D: ...pretty sure.
C: TOM
D: Excuse me.
E: to Girl
C: GIRL
D: Hello stranger.
C: TOM
D: When this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something?
C: GIRL
D: Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet someone.
C: TOM
D: Oh. Got it... No problem.
E: DEFLATED
N: He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.
C: GIRL
D: Ok.
N: Tom turns back around.
C: TOM
D: What's that?
C: GIRL
D: Why not?
C: TOM
D: Yeah?
C: GIRL
D: Yeah.
C: TOM
D: Great! So... I'll wait for you here, or you wait for me or...something.
N: She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.
C: GIRL
D: We'll figure it out.
C: TOM
D: Ok! My name's Tom.
E: extends hand to shake
C: GIRL
D: Nice to meet you...
N: She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.
C: GIRL
D: I'm Autumn.
N: And on his face...
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: THE END (CREDITS ROLL TO "GO ASK YOUR DAD" by THE TYDE)
