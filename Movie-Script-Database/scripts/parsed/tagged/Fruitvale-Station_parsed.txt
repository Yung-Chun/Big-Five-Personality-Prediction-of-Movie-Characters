S: INT. OSCAR'S APARTMENT- BATHROOM- DAY
N: Oscar stands in the shower, letting the water run over his head. There looks to be a lot on his mind.
S: INT. OSCAR'S APARTMENT- KITCHEN- DAY
N: Sophina and Oscar move around the small kitchen like a well oiled machine. Sophina, wearing a WalMart uniform, makes two lunches. Oscar wipes milk from Tatiana's face and fixes her hair.

C: SOPHINA
D: No, T. You can take an extra apple if you want.

S: EXT. FIRST FRUIT LEARNING CENTER- DAY
N: Oscar and Tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two story house. A picture of an apple tree is painted next to the door. Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a frizz in her hair. He looks back at the car. We see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down mirror. Oscar turns to Tatiana. He then takes her hand, and places something inside of it. Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger over his lips. Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile. She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. He stands up and knocks on the front door. MRS.

N: Pink (6/25/2012) 10. She quickly sits up. Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead. Sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car.
C: SOPHINA
D: Bye.
E: CONT'D
C: OSCAR
D: Love you too.
E: playfully
N: SLAM! Sophina shuts the door on him. Oscar laughs. His smile fades, as he watches her go inside.
S: INT. SOPHINA'S CAR- DAY
N: Oscar, now in the car by himself rides in the car listening to HIP HOP MUSIC. He comes to a red light. He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 AM. He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. He turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. He looks around, still not at ease. He turns off his music and pulls out his cellphone. He takes a quick look around to see what cars are around, before dialing numbers. CALLING MOM flashes on the screen. He holds the phone to his ear.

N: Oscar sighs... this is nothing new. Pink (6/25/2012) 12.
C: OSCAR
D: Hold on.
N: He pulls the car over. He looks around for his earpiece for beat- no luck. He takes his cellphone, and slides it into the elastic of his beanie- a poor man's Bluetooth. He pulls off.

S: INT. FARMER JOE'S- DAY- MOMENTS LATER
N: It is a moderately sized grocery store, but several SHOPPERS move about the aisles. Oscar walks over to the seafood section where Cato CALDWELL, a 22 year old charismatic Black male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron. Cato sees Oscar and smiles brightly. He takes a pile of fish off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older BLACK WOMAN. He takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the counter.

C: OSCAR
D: Frisco. Fireworks and the whole shit-
N: Oscar sees something out of the corner of his eye. He motions his head for Cato to look. Cato turns and sees- KATIE, a White girl in her mid 20's, playing with her iPhone while waiting for help. Cato quickly makes his way over.
C: CATO
D: You ready?
C: KATIE
D: Uh, yeah... I want to get a pound of, wait... Can I see what your sole looks like?

C: CATO
D: What you need for moms, bruh?
C: OSCAR

D: Fat ones too, bruh.

N: She looks at Oscar suspiciously.
C: OSCAR

C: KATIE
D: Oh, okay. Well, I'm cooking dinner tonight for my friend, before we go to the city. And he really likes fried fish, like southern style. And I maybe lied a bit, and said that I know how to cook like that.

C: KATIE
D: He's white. But he knows a lot of black people... He's not my boyfriend either...
N: Oscar chuckles at this. Pink (6/25/2012) 17. Katie looks down at her phone again. She uses her fingers to zoom in on something.
C: KATIE
D: I'm not sure what type of fish he wants. And most of these recipes are different on this site.

S: INT. HALLMARK STORE- DAY
N: The store is small and brightly lit. Oscar is reading a card from off the BIRTHDAY FOR MOTHER rack. We see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking on the beach holding her son's hand. Inscribed over it are the words to the religious poem "Footsteps" by Anonymous. Oscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before. Oscar opens the card, and looks inside for a beat. He looks up, moved by the words. He stares off into space.
S: INT. VISITING ROOM- SAN QUENTIN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY-
N: TEN MONTHS EARLIER We look through a foggy window at Wanda sitting at one of several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around them. There are a few VISITORS already sitting at tables with inmates. Several Corrections Officers stand by. We see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking through the glass window of the search room. A Corrections Officer is conducting a search. Oscar's face is bruised under his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the left side of his face. He turns around, bends over and coughs. He turns back around, and the officer hands him his Blue shirt and pants. Oscar puts them on and- BUZZ. The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room to Wanda's table. As he approaches she stands up.

C: OSCAR
D: C'mon. What she say?
C: WANDA
D: She looks up at me and says,"Grandma, do we have any dark butter?"
N: Oscar looks at Wanda with a confused look.
C: OSCAR
D: Dark butter?
C: WANDA
D: Yeah, I'm thinking she saw "Food Network" or something. So I say, "what's dark butter sweetheart?" She says, "When Daddy took me to see WALL.E he asked for light butter, so I want to try some dark butter this time."
N: Oscar looks at Wanda with a bright eyed expression.
C: OSCAR
D: She is gettin way too smart.
N: Another BUZZ from the door is heard. Green (7/5/2012) 29. As the two share a moment, DANIEL CALE, a stocky white inmate in his early 30's walks past Oscar and Wanda's table. He has a large, square bandage under his left eye.
C: CALE

D: That's my best friend right there.
N: Cale flashes a mischievous smile. The Corrections Officer comes over and stands between the two. Oscar watches as Cale sits down across from the woman, who holds the baby. Cale smiles at the woman, and makes coochie coo faces at the baby. Green (7/5/2012) 30. Woman passes the child to Cale over the table. Oscar looks on with malice.
C: WANDA
D: Oscar, Calm down.
N: Wanda's voice snaps the anger off of his face. He looks back to Wanda, and his anger subsides.

C: WANDA
D: You want to keep putting Sophina through this... go ahead. But Tatiana doesn't deserve this. She didn't have a choice.
N: Oscar takes this in.
C: OSCAR
D: She too young to know what's going on right now.
C: WANDA
D: I guess that's why she asked me why you love taking your vacations more than being with her.
N: Oscar cut his eyes from Wanda.
C: OSCAR
D: She aint say that.
C: WANDA
D: So I'm the liar now.
N: Oscar takes a beat to think about this.

N: Green (7/5/2012) 32.
C: WANDA
D: Tell her yourself. Next time you call. Tell your daughter how much you love her over the phone. Or better yet, just let her come visit you?
C: OSCAR
D: I don't want her to see me like this.
C: WANDA
D: Like what?
C: OSCAR
D: In a box.
C: WANDA
D: But this is how you are right now.

N: Wanda scoots back in her chair, stands up, and heads towards the exit. Green (7/5/2012) 33. Oscar remains seated in his chair.
C: OSCAR
D: Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug.

C: OSCAR
D: Ma!
E: CONT'D
N: Wanda continues on, not turning around.
C: OSCAR
D: Ma! Hold up!
E: CONT'D
N: The C.O. sees this. CORRECTIONS OFFICER 1 Grant, back in your assigned visiting area. Oscar ignores him, and continues to follow his Mom. The C.O. hits a button on his walkie, and motions to the other C.O.'s. They quickly move towards Oscar and attempt to grab him.
C: OSCAR
D: Get the fuck off me!
N: Oscar jerks away.
C: OSCAR

We pull back with Wanda as she walks away, trying to hide her pain. Another Corrections Officer sprints past her towards Oscar, who we can still see in the distance.
C: OSCAR
D: Ma! Ma! Get the fuck off me! Ma! Ma!
E: CONT'D to the C.O.s to Wanda
N: Oscar looks on at Wanda as she leaves, growing small in the distance.

N: Oscar puts his phone back into his pocket. He turns and begins to pump his gas. He sets the handle to automatically pump, and looks up and notices something. Pink (6/25/2012) 36. We see it is a gnarly- looking male PIT BULL sniffing around a few feet from Oscar's tires. It looks to be maybe 3 or 4 years old. Oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over. Oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes. He feels around the dog's neck- no collar. Oscar looks around for an owner for a beat while the dog licks his hand. CLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog, places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes off running towards the street.
C: OSCAR
D: Shit! No, No, No Stop!
N: SCHREECH... BAM! We hear it before we see it. A sickening sound. An animal YELPS, a car SPEEDS OFF. Oscar runs into the street chasing a car going too fast for us to see.
C: OSCAR
D: Hey! Stop you bitch ass Muthafucka!!
E: CONT'D at the car
N: He stops, turns around, and runs over to something lying in the street. It's the dog, and he's in bad shape. Oscar picks the dog up out of the street, and places him on the sidewalk.

D: Shit. Somebody help! Somebody fucking Help!
E: CONT'D to himself shouting
N: Pink (6/25/2012) 37. Oscar continues to pet his head. The dog starts to violently shake... He becomes unnaturally still. Oscar stares at the Dog for a long beat, shaken up by this. He looks around, no one seems to have noticed. He bends down, closes the Dog's eyes, and heads for his car.
S: EXT. POINT EMERY- PARKING LOT- DAY
N: It is an empty parking lot next to a beautiful view of the Bay. Oscar's car pulls up. After a short beat. A Lexus pulls up along side of it. Marcus hops out of the Lexus and walks over to Oscar's car.

N: Marcus puts it back into his mouth.
C: MARCUS
D: Right on Osc, then bruh.

S: EXT. POINT EMERY- SHORELINE- DAY
N: Oscar walks out onto the shoreline, looking at the water. He looks around for a beat. He walks all the way out into the water. Standing on rocks. Green (7/5/2012) 38A. He looks over both shoulders, to make sure no one is watching. He then goes into his waistband and pulls out the Ziplock bag of weed. He squats down, opens the bag, and dumps it into the water. He watches as the green buds float off.
S: EXT. WALMART ENTRANCE- CONTINOUS

N: Oscar is beating Tatiana to the car by a mile. Tatiana follows him laughing loudly.
C: TATIANA
D: You cheated!
S: INT. SOPHINA'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE- KITCHEN- DAY
N: A small television sits next to the stove playing a Telenovella. Looking at the episode from the kitchen doorway is MARIANA PANGELINA, Sophina's 65 year old grandmother. SIZZLING can be heard coming from the kitchen. The front door opens, and in walks Sophina, Oscar, and Tatiana.

N: Pink (6/25/2012) 52.
C: CEEPHUS
D: But I think it's a sign of the times. The country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't have messed the country up so bad. Would he have even had a shot?
C: DARYL
D: I think he still would have had a shot.
C: CEEPHUS

S: INT. OPERATING ROOM- SIMULTANEOUS
N: Oscar lies on the operating table, sedated. The Surgeons talk medical speak. They move with astounding quickness and precision. Lead Surgeon takes a large scalpel, and makes a 14 inch incision under Oscar's right nipple. Blood rushes out, it's worse than they thought. It begins to hit the floor. A RESIDENT SURGEON reacts to this, and quickly grabs a large emesis basin. He puts it underneath the wound, catching the blood. Another Surgeon places a spreader into the wound, and opens it up.
