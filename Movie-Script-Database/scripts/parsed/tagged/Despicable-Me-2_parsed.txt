M: EXT: ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY
N: Snow and ice as far as the eye can see. What looks like a windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences sits in the middle of the wasteland. TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY. ARCTIC CIRCLE. At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an overturned barrel as a table. Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces. The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in the pile of coins. While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them. Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly, until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a table flies up, knocking them over. Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY. A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship. Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to their guns. A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet. Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from the ground. Then-- THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND. CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab, vehicles, and weapons. The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta- potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He closes the door.

N: EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - DAY Gru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun, which he loads and cocks. He pulls the trigger, which shoots out an inflatable unicorn balloon. Smiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others. EXT: GRU'S BACKYARD - DAY A banner reads: "Happy Birthday Agnes!" and a massive backyard party is in full swing. The yard is decorated with pink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a castle. AGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide. They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a princess riding a unicorn.
C: AGNES
D: This is the best party EVER!!!
N: Edith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades, and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her. She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap.
C: EDITH
D: Haha! Yeah! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 3.
N: Two LITTLE GIRLS fish in a small kiddie pool. One of the girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but then a LIVE PIRANHA jumps out and eats the toy duck. A BOY and a GIRL sword fight. The Boy does a bunch of fancy moves. The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him on the head with a club. Two kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs. Agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen.
C: AGNES
D: Oh no! A dragon is approaching!
N: All of the kids turn and see KYLE dressed as a dragon. He GRUMBLES and then they SCREAM and huddle around Agnes. Then Margo enters wearing a SUIT OF ARMOR and wielding a SWORD.
C: MARGO
D: Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us!
N: She gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of armor and wielding various MEDIEVAL WEAPONS. The Kids CHEER as the minions charge toward Kyle. One accidentally hits another with his sword. A fight ensues in which they use the medieval weapons on each other. One minion pounds another with a MACE. One Minion wanders off from the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging his mace. Across the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on the phone. Not happy.
C: GRU
D: No, no, no! What do you mean she's not coming?! I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess!
N: The mace-swinging Minion walks by and accidently, repeatedly hits Gru with the mace in the shin.
C: GRU
D: Ah! Hurts! Ah! Stop it!
E: CONT'D
N: Gru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a spatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace. Gru SIGHS and returns to the call. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 4.

E: CONT'D Resigned
N: Gru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up. Turns and sees Agnes standing there.
C: AGNES
D: Ooh ooh! When's the Fairy Princess coming?
N: Gru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes. He opens his mouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it.
C: GRU
D: Any minute now!
N: Agnes squeals with excitement and runs off.
C: AGNES
D: Yayyy!
N: Gru looks worried--what do I do now? He signals two minions.
C: GRU
D: Stall them.
N: EXT: BACKYARD - LATER A hand-painted piece of cardboard reading "THE MAGIC SHOW" is placed on an easel. Agnes and all of the little kids sit in a semicircle on the grass. Two minions dressed as magicians are doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant. One minion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth. Then the other whips out a CHAINSAW and fires it up, heading toward her. Margo sees this and quickly intervenes.
C: MARGO
D: Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright. That's enough of the magic show!
N: The minions don't hide their disappointment.
C: MINIONS
D: Awwww. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 5.
N: Margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something.
C: MARGO
D: Wait, did you hear that? It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust.
C: AGNES
D: It's the fairy princess! She's coming!
E: gasps
N: Margo gasps and points up to the sky.
C: MARGO
D: Look!
N: Edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it up to reveal-- Gru. Dressed in a PUFFY PINK DRESS, fairy wings, glittery eyelashes and tiara and magical wand. Up on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him down on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts them. They let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into the wall of the house and crashing to the ground.
C: GRU
D: Aaaaaahh!
N: He stands up and tries to cover. Agnes SIGHS HAPPILY, in awe of the fairy princess.
C: GRU
D: It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The most magical fairy princess of all! And I am here to wish Princess Agnes a very happy birthday!
E: CONT'D in falsetto
N: Gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to stare, frozen. Then a LITTLE GIRL raises her hand and speaks with a lisp.
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: How come you're tho fat?
N: Gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a high-pitched, dreamy voice. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 6.
C: GRU
D: Because my house is made of candy and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems.
N: The girl starts to ask another question.
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: How come you have-
N: Gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face. She COUGHS.
C: GRU
D: Okay! Time for cake!
N: As the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru.
C: AGNES
D: Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're the best fairy princess ever!
N: Gru smiles.
C: GRU
D: You are welcome, little girl.
E: in falsetto
N: She runs off, but quickly returns.
C: AGNES
D: I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids.
E: whispers in his ear
N: She runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go. Couldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a heavily-Botoxed mom.
C: JILLIAN
D: Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the Party!
C: GRU
D: Hello, Jillian.
E: forcing a smile
C: JILLIAN
D: Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and... DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 7.
N: In the background, a homely NATALIE leans against a buffet table and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru. The table collapses to the ground beneath her.
C: GRU
D: No, no, no, get off of the limb right now. No limb.
E: realizes what's going on
C: JILLIAN
D: Oh, come on...she's a riot. She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her...
N: In the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the ground.
C: GRU
D: No, Jill's, that is not happening. Seriously. I'm fine.
C: JILLIAN
D: Okay, fine. Forget Natalie. How about my cousin Linda?
E: calling after Gru
N: Gru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo.
C: GRU
D: No.
C: JILLIAN
D: Oh, oh! I know someone whose husband just died!
N: SPLASH! Suddenly Jillian is sprayed in the face with water. Reveal Gru holding a HOSE with a SPRAY NOZZLE.

N: SPLASH! He sprays her again. She falls down.
C: GRU
D: Or there.
E: CONT'D
N: He drops the hose and walks away, CHUCKLING softly. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 8. EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DUSK Gru takes Kyle out to the front yard. CAMERA POV A camera with nightvision is watching them. The screen analyzes Kyle and a readout comes out as "SPECIES: UNKNOWN." Kyle sniffs Gru's flowers.
C: GRU

C: GRU
D: Ky--Kyle! No, do not do your business on the petunias!
E: CONT'D

C: GRU

C: GRU
D: Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 9.
N: Gru whips out his FREEZE RAY and fires it. A WALL OF ICE heads for Lucy. But before it gets to her, Lucy pulls out a retractable gun from her purse, which acts as a FLAMETHROWER. Melting the ice.
C: LUCY
D: You know you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru. For example--
N: She pulls out a LIPSTICK. Fires it at Gru. The tip flies through the air and connects with his chest, latching on. ZZZZZAPPP! It tases him, which sends his body flailing in different funny poses before passing out.
C: LUCY
D: Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so good.
E: CONT'D
N: EXT: STREET - LATER Lucy tries to drag Gru to her car, but he's too heavy.
C: LUCY
D: Man. Ugh. Large...person.
N: She gets an idea. Lucy gets into her car. In the background, we see Gru begin to come to, but he is struck by Lucy's car as she pulls back and is knocked out again.
C: LUCY
D: Oh...sorry!
E: CONT'D
N: Closer now, Lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk. Just then Tom and Stuart come out of Gru's garage and see their boss being loaded in. Lucy struggles to close the trunk.
C: LUCY
D: Get...in...there...you...big...man!
E: CONT'D
N: SLAM! Lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into the vehicle. Tom and Stuart exchange horrified looks.
C: TOM AND STUART
D: Boss! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 10.
N: They take off running after the car as it pulls away, running as fast as their tiny legs will carry them. They get right behind it and Tom LEAPS up onto the trunk. He reaches his hand out to Stuart, who is falling behind.
C: TOM
D: Koom ey lah!
C: STUART
D: Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!
N: Stuart leaps for the bumper and Tom catches him by his overall straps. Tom holds on tight as Stuart dangles from the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out.
C: STUART
D: Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!
E: CONT'D
N: As Lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box. Now in the box, Stuart continues to ride behind the car, and even starts to get the hang of that, too. He waves at Tom, and Tom waves back.
C: STUART
D: Woooo!
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Ooooh!
N: All is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets stuck on Stuart. The sheet forms a parasail which lifts Stuart up into the air. He strikes a Superman flying pose. Then a flock of GEESE fly toward him and one actually slams into his face.
C: STUART
D: Quack quack!
N: It SQUAWKS at him as it flies off. Lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on the brakes. SCREECH! Both minions fly forward-- INT: LUCY'S CAR - SAME Lucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's seat. They strike threatening karate poses. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 11.

N: Lucy tases them and they pass out. She floors it. EXT: STREET - SAME Lucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded PIER. And doesn't stop. It drives right off the end of the pier. A confused fisherman leaps for his life.
C: CONFUSED FISHERMAN
D: What the-- Oh!
N: SPLASH! INT: OCEAN - SAME Lucy's car now transforms into an UNDERWATER VEHICLE. As the minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio until Lucy slaps his hand away. They speed through the sea and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had enough and swims off in a cloud of ink. She HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish.
C: MINIONS
D: Whoa...
N: As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE with the letters "AVL" on the side. A HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside. The hatch closes behind her. INT: AVL SUB - SAME The water drains out from the holding dock. A buffer and hair dryer come out to dry off the car. A squeegee wipes off the windshield. Then the platform the car is on lowers down. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 12. INT: AVL ROOM - DAY Lucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them in. Lucy and the Minions get out of the car. She pushes a button on her remote and Gru, with a starfish attached to his head, is ejected from the trunk.
C: GRU
D: Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh, foot's asleep...ah...pins and needles...
E: groggily
C: SILAS
D: Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.
E: O.S.
C: GRU
D: Ehhh...
C: SILAS
D: I apologize for our methods in getting you here.
C: LUCY
D: I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I enjoyed that. Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.
C: SILAS
D: That's enough, Agent Wilde.
C: LUCY
D: Sorry, sir.
C: GRU
D: Okay, this is bogus!
N: Gru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto Tom's. Stuart LAUGHS at him.

E: CONT'D
N: A WAITER comes over with tea for Silas.
C: SILAS
D: We are the Anti-Villain League. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 13.
N: As Silas summons a map that shows all of the AVL offices around the world, Lucy's car drops out of the way. Stuart is trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back onto stable ground. Silas continues.
C: SILAS
D: An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale. Rob a bank? We're not interested. Kill someone? Not our deal. But you want to melt the polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt. Fuji? Or even steal the moon? Then we notice.
E: CONT'D
C: GRU
D: First of all, you've got no proof that I did that. Second, after I did do that, I put it back!
C: SILAS
D: We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru. That's why we've brought you here. I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom.
E: beat

C: TOM
D: Bottom.
C: TOM AND STUART
D: Heeheheeeeheeehee.
N: Silas bristles at this, and glances over at Lucy.
C: SILAS
D: Hilarious. Agent Wilde...
C: LUCY
D: Oh, me now...?
N: She continues the de-briefing, turning to the screens, which show an image of the Magnet Ship stealing the lab.
C: LUCY
D: Um, recently an entire top secret lab disappeared from the Arctic Circle. Yeah, the entire lab. Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where did it go? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 14.
E: CONT'D
C: GRU
D: I don't care.
N: The screen shows FOOTAGE of a TINY LITTLE BUNNY in a scientific lab. Furry and adorable.
C: LUCY
D: The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum. What is PX-41, you ask? Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.
N: A LABCOAT TECHNICIAN approaches the bunny with a SYRINGE containing the purple liquid. Injects some in its butt.
C: TOM AND STUART
D: Aaah!
N: Instantly the bunny transforms into a HIDEOUS PURPLE MONSTER BUNNY. Gru and the Minions smile, impressed. Then it goes crazy and attacks the scientist. Gru covers his eyes and the Minions pass out.
C: GRU
D: Oh!
N: The bunny attacks the technician, then the camera...and the film is over.
C: GRU
D: Hmm, you usually don't see that in bunnies.
E: CONT'D
C: SILAS
D: As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth. Fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint, and using the latest chemtracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.
E: struggles to get through the opening in the table
N: On the screens we see images depicting a highly technical diagram of the shopping mall.
C: GRU
D: Ha! A mall? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 15.
C: SILAS
D: Precisely. And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.
N: Silas scrolls through pictures of the mall's shop owners.
C: SILAS
D: And that's where you come in. As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts.
E: CONT'D
C: LUCY
D: The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully you'll be able to--
C: GRU
D: Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission Impossible stuff, but no. No! I am a father now. And a legitimate businessman. I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.
N: Silas shoots him a look. He CHUCKLES.
C: SILAS
D: Jams and...jellies?
C: GRU
D: Oh, attitude! That's right! So thanks, but no thanks. And here's a tip--instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call! Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!
E: beat
C: SILAS
D: Ramsbottom.
C: GRU
D: Oh, yeah, like that's any better!
E: chuckles
N: Gru turns and heads for the door, followed by Tom and Stuart, who continue to GIGGLE about Ramsbottom's name. EXT: OCEAN - NIGHT Gru exits the AVL headquarters, which he now sees is on a
C: SUBMARINE.
D: DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 16.
N: Lucy leans out the door and taps him on the shoulder.
C: LUCY
D: Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing, so if you ever want to get back to doing something awesome--give us a call.
N: She hands Gru her BUSINESS CARD. Gru takes it and stares at it. EXT: OCEAN - LATER Gru rows back to shore as Tom yells to him like a coxswain. Gru GRUNTS with each stroke.

C: EDITH
D: Why not? Are you scared?
N: Gru stares back at Edith. Gets a far-away look in his eyes. EXT: PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - DAY We flash back to LITTLE GRU on the school playground. He stares, lovesick, at a CUTE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, named LISA.

N: The playground erupts with SCREAMS and everyone turns and runs away. Little Gru is left alone. Crushed. INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT Gru comes out of the flashback.
C: GRU
D: Scared? Of what? Women?! No, that's bonkers! I just-- I have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed. I'm not scared-- of women... or dates... let's go to bed.

N: Gru sighs and gives her a kiss.
C: GRU
D: Goodnight, Agnes. Never get older.
N: Gru turns out the light and leaves the room. INT: LAB - DAY Gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab, passing minions in various stages of jelly making. A sign reading, JELLY TESTING AREA" has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning sign. A SUPERVISOR MINION checks his clipboard as the MINION next to him steals a banana from his pocket. He turns, but the Minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth. We see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks.
C: SUPERVISOR MINION
D: Hey, oh! Me banana! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 20.
N: The Minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs. A single apple is passed down a line of Minions in the least efficient way possible. A few Minions mash fruits in large vats ala "I Love Lucy." One wears a bunch of fruit on his head like Carmen Miranda and sings the CHIQUITA BANANA song. His supervisor comes over and tells him to get back to work. The Minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips and falls down into a large test-tube filled with mashed fruit. Then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor belt. The trapped Minion is injected into one of the jars. Gru enters the lab and greets the minions.
C: GRU
D: Hey, Tim, nice haircut!
N: He points at Tim.
C: GRU

E: CONT'D
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: I developed a new formula which allowed me to get every known kind of berry into one flavor of jelly.
N: Gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the jar. Makes a disgusted face, then attempts a smile.
C: GRU
D: That tastes good... Love the flavor of that...
E: faking it gags
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: It's horrible, isn't it? DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 21.
C: GRU
D: No! No! Oh, we're making great progress! Here, try some of this.
E: to the Minions
N: He hands a jar to a minion, who tries it. He GAGS! Another minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue. They smash the jar and all the minions run away, disgusted.
C: GRU
D: Whoa... okay, just because everybody hates it doesn't mean it's not good.
E: CONT'D
N: Dr. Nefario hangs his head.
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: Listen, Gru. There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.
C: GRU
D: What? What's wrong?
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: I miss being evil. Sinister plots, large-scale crimes...It's what I live for! I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?
E: clears his throat
C: GRU
D: Well, I'm also considering a line of jams...
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: Um...the thing is, Gru... I've had an offer of employment elsewhere.
E: deep breath
C: GRU
D: Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're kidding, right?
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: It's a great opportunity for me, bigger lab, more evil, full dental...
N: Dr. Nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up into a traveling suitcase. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 22. Dr. Nefario hangs his head. Gru stares back at his old friend.
C: GRU
D: Very well. Let us give you the proper send-off. Minions!

The sign reads, "BAKE MY DAY" Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses.
C: GRU
D: Hm. "Bake My Day." Blech.
N: INT: BAKE MY DAY - CONTINUOUS Gru unlocks the door and enters. JINGLE! BELLS on the door ring. The inside is sugary and clean and quaint. Gru takes it all in. Then turns to the minions.

DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 27. Gru SCREAMS, which causes Lucy to SCREAM and jump up, hitting her head on one of the shelves, sending all of the CUPCAKES flying. Lucy immediately goes into action, using incredible and frankly weird-looking MARTIAL ARTS MOVES to dispatch the cupcakes as they fly toward her.
C: LUCY
D: Ha! Yaa! Ho! Ooof! Zaaa! Ay-ay- ay-ay-ay!

E: CONT'D
C: GRU
D: Okay, that's weird--why are you here?
C: LUCY
D: On assignment from Silas. I'm your new partner. Yay!
C: GRU
D: What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner.
C: LUCY
D: Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. But not me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway.
N: Gru is about to respond when Dave the minion comes out the kitchen door. He carries a cupcake in the shape of a Minion.
C: DAVE
D: Walla!
N: Immediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes. She smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to the counter. Dave SCREAMS.
C: LUCY
D: You know this guy?

N: EXT: DESERT - DAY - FLASHBACK Classic Spaghetti western sepia-toned shot of El Macho looking menacing. He looks like the large Hispanic man from the mall, only younger and wearing a Lucha Libre outfit and mask (a mask which looks similar to the one Gru imagined). El Macho pushes the BARKEEP out of the way and grabs a large bottle from behind the bar.
C: GRU
D: He was ruthless. He was dangerous. And as the name implies, very macho.
E: V.O.
N: El Macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle over his own head. He reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the bar. He squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot glass. He drinks it down and then eats the glass. He sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him, leaving an EL Macho-shaped hole.

C: MINIONS
D: Hey!
N: Pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing. We move through the crowd, passing by the mace-wielding minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs. We cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place in elaborate dance routines. Back on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus. One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being held up by the other two. Another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running up the other way. Several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream, lazily sipping at it through long straws. Gru enters and takes it all in. Other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the canopy, drinking directly from the spouts. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 37.

N: Jerry slaps him. Kevin slaps him back. They start to slap fight until-- A SPOTLIGHT comes down from above, lighting up the terrified minions. Before they can scream... WOOSH! Jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted by aliens. Kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the air. The light goes out. A few seconds later the light comes back on and drops the cat back down. It turns off again and the Minions are gone.

C: LUCY

C: GRU
D: Over here, over here! Over... here.
N: Too late. The minions shake as they go up the bumpy stairs. Once they reach the top they take a left and start driving in circles around the balcony. Gru pulls out a grappling hook and aims for the balcony railing.

E: CONT'D grabbing Lucy
N: They shoot up and land right back where they started - at Salsa & Salsa! The minions zoom by in the car and Gru SIGHS in exasperation. Just then, Eduardo emerges from the restaurant with fire in his eyes and a knife in his hand. Eduardo produces many more KNIVES and heads straight for them.
C: EDUARDO
D: I have you now!
N: BAM! Eduardo is struck unconscious by Lucy's car. Just in time. Lucy opens the car door. One of the minions holds a toothpick in his hand and leans on the steering wheel, seductively.

N: The other minion revs the engine suggestively. Eduardo starts to wake up. The car zooms past him. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 46. EXT: MALL DOME - SAME CRASH! Lucy's car plummets towards the ground. Gru SCREAMS hysterically, but Lucy just hits a button and the car TRANSFORMS into a jet. They fly off into the night sky. EXT: GRU'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING It's a beautiful morning. An ICE CREAM TRUCK makes its way down the street (playing the song the minions were singing earlier). It stops and a couple of CHILDREN run to meet it. Stuart opens Gru's front door, having heard the commotion. Two other minions approach as well. Stuart spots the ice cream truck and points to it, excited.
C: STUART
D: Oh! Oh! Gelato!

C: STUART
D: Stopa! Stopa!!
N: A hush comes over the minions.

E: CONT'D knocking on the truck
N: Suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms into a LARGE TUBE and extends itself above the minions. Stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order gelato, but the it begins SUCKING the minions into it. ZUP! ZUP! ZUP! One by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into the truck until there is only one left. He tries to make a break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of him. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 47. He licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into the ice cream cone. The it closes and the truck drives away. The children look on puzzled. EXT: PARADISE MALL - DAY The hole that Lucy's car crashed through last night has been patched with plywood boards.

N: BINOCULARS POV Suddenly a MAN approaches the trash can with a steaming cup of coffee. The binoculars readout says "WARNING! EXTREMELY HOT."

E: CONT'D to himself
N: The man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see Gru's legs pop out from beneath the can. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 48. The man looks confused and tries again. Gru dodges and takes off running. The man chases after him. Gru accidentally knocks into a bent-over woman's rear end. Insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and slaps him across the face. Unfortunately, Gru doesn't see the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs. CRASH! BANG! CLANG! Finally, Gru pops out of the trash can and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a THUD! Flat on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out.

N: INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY The girls are at the MALL FOUNTAIN. Agnes has her eyes closed and a very intense look on her face, as if she's really concentrating on something. There is something in her tightly clenched fist. She tosses a PENNY. Then opens her eyes, waiting for her wish to come true. Then Edith emerges from the water wearing a DIVING MASK AND SNORKEL, hands full of COINS.
C: AGNES
D: Is that stealing?
C: EDITH
D: Not if my wish was that I would get a lot of free coins.
N: Margo is busy texting. Then something offscreen catches her eye. It's a boy. This is ANTONIO. Suave, cool, and a bit dangerous. We watch in SLOW MOTION as he strolls behind the fountain, and then disappears in its spraying water. Margo looks for Antonio. Backs into the fountain and nearly falls into it.

C: MARGO
D: Whoa!
N: Everyone in the restaurant cheers. Gru frowns. Not this guy! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 56. The music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and out into the mall where he grabs a passing SHOPPER and pulls her into the restaurant. The confused woman holds on for the ride as Eduardo twirls and dances her all around the floor. He dips her and she melts, as do all of the women watching. Eduardo gazes into the woman's eyes and produces a business card.
C: EDUARDO
D: Kids eat free on Tuesdays.
N: The woman grabs the business card from his hand with her teeth. Then Eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband. Then the song comes to an end and Eduardo strikes a final pose. Everyone in the studio cheers.

D: Yeah! Wahoo! Cool! Awesome!
N: Everyone except Gru. Eduardo walks over to him and gives him a big warm hug.
C: EDUARDO

C: EDUARDO
D: That is a pity. Young love is beautiful, no?
C: GRU
D: No! You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other!
E: chuckling nervously
N: Eduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea.
C: EDUARDO
D: You are right, Cabeza de Huevo! They must get to know each other better. Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party?
C: GRU
D: No, no, I am--
C: GIRLS
D: Si!
N: The girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio. As if on cue, MUSIC begins playing and they all begin dancing together. Antonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor. Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill. A waiter comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes the glass with his bare hands. His eye twitches.

C: GRU
D: Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son.
N: Gru approaches Silas.
C: GRU
D: I think that the son is the mastermind. There's a look. There's a devilish look in his eyes and I don't like it!
E: CONT'D whispers
C: SILAS

She presses a button on her watch, which transforms into a HIGH TECH EAVESDROPPING DEVICE, and puts it in her ear. Now she's able to hear Gru and Shannon talking. She watches them, intrigued. Shannon has returned to her seat.

D: No they're not! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing off your head and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
C: LUCY
D: I don't think so, Miss Lady.
N: Lucy presses a button on her watch and a target sight pops out. Gru watches in horror as Shannon reaches across the table for the wig. Quickly Lucy presses another button on her watch which fires a MINI-DART GUN at Shannon. PLIP. The mini-dart goes into Shannon's butt, knocking her out instantly. And saving Gru from certain humiliation. Gru stares at the now sleeping Shannon, confused.

INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY Gru continues happily dancing through the mall on his way to the cupcake shop. He shimmies with a FAT WOMAN on the escalator, then GAPS and stops suddenly upon seeing Eagle Hair Club closed. The MUSIC abruptly ends. Gru sees Silas speaking with an AVL AGENT. Gru approaches him.

C: GRU
D: Well... it looks like they need you, so...
C: LUCY
D: Yeah, I uh, I better go. Bye, Gru.
N: And she leaves Gru. He stands there. Completely miserable. EXT: STREET - DAY Gru walks back home, completely depressed. Walks past the college kids playing frisbee. Catches the frisbee and tosses it down the sewer. Walks past the group of bucket drummers. As he passes he KICKS one of the buckets. Walks past the old ladies doing Tai Chi. As they balance on one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over. EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT It's pouring rain. Gru sits alone outside his house. Miserable. And then an UMBRELLA approaches him. It looks like it's traveling on its own. But when it gets closer it lifts up, revealing Agnes.

N: Gru takes the umbrella and Agnes joins him. They both huddle under it.
C: GRU

They pull up to the front gate. EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE GATE - SAME Gru's vehicle pulls up in front of the open gate in front of Eduardo's house. His car almost knocks a bunch of parked cars off the cliff. The grounds are set up for the most elaborate and fun Cinco de Mayo party of all time. Sumptuous spreads of MEXICAN FOOD everywhere. LANTERNS hanging from trees. PEOPLE having a great time. Gru and the girls enter the compound.

E: rolling her r like crazy
N: Gru watches them go. Frowns. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 77. EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER Gru, sneaking through the party, spots Antonio and Margo dancing. Gru sneaks up on Antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to cover his approach. Suddenly Antonio is gone and Gru is the one dancing with Margo, who has her back to him and is oblivious to what's going on. Antonio reappears and kicks Gru in the crotch from behind. He dances once again with Margo while Gru hunches over in pain. Gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking Antonio and shaking him. Margo turns around and sees this. Gru and Antonio see they are being watched by Margo and start casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong. As the song ends, Margo takes Antonio's hand and pulls him away from Gru off the dance floor. Gru is defeated and all alone. INT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER Gru sits by himself in the corner, sulking and staring at Lucy's lipstick taser. A WAITER walks by and places a tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with guacamole. He breaks off a piece, dips it, and eats it.
C: EDUARDO
D: So glad you could make it, mi compadre.

E: CONT'D sensing something's wrong
C: GRU
D: Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong. I'm just chilling with the guac...from my chip hat.

C: EDUARDO
D: Gru, please. I know that look all too well. It is the look of a broken heart.
C: GRU
D: How did you know?
C: EDUARDO
D: Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.
C: GRU
D: You?
C: EL MACHO
D: Yes. But we are survivors. There's much more to us than meets the eye. Enjoy the party.
N: Eduardo gives Gru a meaningful look. And then walks away. Gru watches him go. Deep in thought. Gru notices Eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party and head into the house. Gru gets up from the table and follows Eduardo. As he walks through the party, several partygoers break tortilla pieces off his sombrero to eat. INT: EDUARDO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Eduardo enters a dimly-lit room. Gru sneaks behind and peers through a crack in the door. INT: SECRET MAYAN ROOM - CONTINUOUS Eduardo stands in the center of a secret room, which is lined with Mayan-style totem poles. He dances on the tile floor, which lights up and plays "La Cucaracha" with each strategic step. The musical pattern is a code which opens a secret passageway through the largest totem's mouth. Eduardo enters and the mouth closes behind him. Gru tentatively enters the room. He pauses at the tile floor. He tries to replicate Eduardo's "La Cucaracha" code, but a glob of guacamole from his sombrero falls to the floor and hits the wrong tile. This activates a booby-trapped totem pole, which halves Gru's sombrero with a spear. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 79.
C: GRU
D: What the--oh!
N: Gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands.
C: GRU

D: Oh!

D: Aaaahhh!
E: CONT'D in pain
N: Gru falls to the floor.
C: GRU
D: Oooohhh.

C: GRU
D: Aha! Ha ha ha--

She grabs an in flight magazine and opens it up to an ad for wristwatches. It reads; "IN THE SKY, HE IS THE ONE MAN EVERYONE CAN TRUST" and shows a picture of Gru giving the thumbs up in a cockpit.
C: LUCY
D: Say what?
N: Lucy reacts, shakes her head, and now the picture is just a regular airline pilot in the cockpit. Lucy turns the page. It's another ad, saying simply "Gru Now!" and showing a picture of a muscular Gru diving from a waterfall. She GASPS and slams the magazine shut, then slowly reopens it to find the picture is really just a random muscular guy diving. It says "GO NOW - TO HAWAII!"
C: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?
E: O.S.
N: Lucy looks up from her magazine to see the flight attendant, who looks like Gru. She REACTS. Then looks across the aisle and sees a lady that looks and sounds like Gru, talking to another man who looks like Gru.
C: FEMALE GRU PASSENGER
D: Ha ha ha ha ha! That's a good joke.
N: Then Lucy looks behind her and sees the young mother looks like Gru. The baby turns around and also looks like Gru.

N: The flight attendant stands up, recovering from her twirl.

N: The other passengers wave as the plane's oxygen masks fall from each overhead console. And with that, Lucy jumps from the plane, holding her purse. EXT: SKY - DAY As Lucy falls from the sky she presses a button on her purse and it transforms into a hanglider. She flies off with purpose. INT: TUNNEL - DAY Elevator doors open revealing EL MACHO'S UNDERGROUND LAIR. Gru stands in the doorway, pulling the dart out of his nose.

D: Sorry--I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause.
C: GRU
D: Oh! Kevin? Agh!

N: Dr. Nefario pops a celebratory noisemaker in the background.
C: DR. NEFARIO

N: El Macho eagerly awaits Gru's reply. Gru just stares at him. How does he get out of this?
C: GRU
D: Uh...yeah...probably...
N: El Macho is taken aback. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 84.

C: GRU
D: Come on. We're getting her out of there.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Gru marches out of the room, fire in his eyes. A man on a mission. To save the woman he loves. The minions are visibly disappointed to leave their video game. One of them clutches the controller in his hand and continues to play until the moment he exits the frame. INT: GRU'S GARAGE - DAY Gru gets on his motorcycle. It's the GRUCYCLE, a Gru-style motorcycle, like Arnold in Terminator 2. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 89. EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY A playhouse in Gru's front yard drops away, revealing a hatch in the ground. Out drives Gru. Two minions sit behind him holding on. He speeds down the road. Ready to kick some butt. EXT: EL MACHO'S COMPOUND - DAY The yard is now filled with ROCKET SHIPS. From behind, we watch El Macho emerge from his home to survey the troops. Some minions file into the rocket ships. El Macho watches them and LAUGHS maniacally. EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY EVIL MINION POV: The evil minion Kevin runs down the street, nearing Gru's house. He is scared by his own reflection in a shiny parked car. He spots a tricycle and eats it. Then Kyle spots him and GROWLS. Kyle runs off and evil minion Kevin gives chase. He stops when he sees the front door. INT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY Margo and Agnes sit on the floor playing a princess board game. Next to Agnes is her unicorn. They hear a SCRATCHING SOUND outside the window. Agnes looks scared.
C: AGNES
D: What was that?
N: Margo stands up. Makes her way toward the window, which is covered with drapes. Then reaches a nervous hand and pulls back the drapes.
C: MARGO
D: I don't see anything.
N: Suddenly, evil minion Kevin appears at the window, looking really scary! Margo SCREAMS. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 90. SMASH! Evil minion Kevin crashes through the window and lands in the family room surrounded by shattered glass and tangled up in the curtain. He turns to the girls, who slowly back away. He looks at Agnes and ROARS.

D: Run!
E: CONT'D
N: Margo grabs Agnes and they run out of the room, accidentally dropping the stuffed unicorn behind. Agnes stops and runs back for it.
C: AGNES
D: My unicorn!
C: MARGO
D: Agnes, no!
N: Agnes stops and sees evil minion Kevin already has it in his mouth. Agnes screams a crazy HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM. It SHATTERS all the glass in the room, including the glass in evil minion Kevin's goggles. He spits out the unicorn. He is slowed him down for a bit, so Agnes safely grabs the unicorn, and Margo grabs Agnes's hand. They run for the elevator to the lower level, with the purple minion hot on their tails. The elevator drops just in time. Evil minion Kevin slams into the glass door. INT: GRU'S LAB - SAME Margo and Agnes run into the lab to find half a dozen minions milling about.
C: MARGO

N: CRASH! The purple minion has eaten its way through the ceiling! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 91.
C: AGNES
D: Whoa!
N: It drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow minion. The girls SCREAM as it jumps up and dashes towards them. Evil minion Kevin stomps toward the girls. They are backed into a corner. It's all over. Then suddenly a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE enters frame and injects evil minion Kevin. He falls over, writhing on the floor. Then he sits up and-- Has turned back into a YELLOW MINION. It's Kevin!
C: KEVIN

E: CONT'D
N: He pours the antidote into the vat. EXT: EL MACHO'S HOUSE - LATER Gru makes his way up the road leading to El Macho's house. He is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear-point by Dave and Stuart, who have been painted purple to look like Evil minions. But they are goofing around and giggling. And they still have a few yellow spots. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 92.
C: GRU
D: Hey, guys. Come on! Stay focused here!
N: The minions somber up.
C: MINIONS
D: Okay, okay.
N: Gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint. They approach the front gate, which is closed. Dave boosts himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the intercom. He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response. He responds back in Evil Minion gibberish. The intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open. The gate opens and there are DOZENS of PURPLE MINIONS milling about. They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously. Dave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear.
C: GRU
D: Curses. Foiled again. These guys captured me.
E: attempting to act
N: The Evil Minions CHEER at seeing this. Gru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. The painted yellow minions are very nervous. The purple minions eye them as they pass. They GROWL and the yellow minions attempt to GROWL back. It's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to make it. Then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at one of the painted ones. They get into a raspberry fight until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the slobber off him. It rubs off the purple paint. One of the evil purple minions points and SCREAMS. They're exposed! All of the purple minions run towards Gru, Dave and Stuart. Teeth bared. Ready to chomp.
C: GRU
D: Run!
E: CONT'D
N: They take off running. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 93. EXT: EL MACHO'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS Gru and the yellow minions burst into El Macho's backyard. The Evil Minions give chase.
C: GRU
D: Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!
N: They climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be pursued by more minions up there. And the Evil Minions have devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either. With no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they reach the top--a dead end. Here come the purple minions. They're trapped. Gru kicks them away and the yellow minions try to fight off the purple ones. But they are clearly doomed. And then Gru's ship appears hovering above them! Modified as a jelly-dispensing weapon and with Dr. Nefario at the controls! The minions hang on the sides holding JELLY BLASTERS. The ship opens fire on the evil minions, transforming them. POP! POP! POP! POP! One by one they transform back into yellow minions. One of the Minions wipes the horrible tasting jelly off his tongue. Dr. Nefario sticks his head out the side of the ship.
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: Hello, Gru!
C: GRU
D: Hey, hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!
N: Gru leaps onto the ship.

N: Gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof El Macho is on. He has two big jelly weapons in his hands. Meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing, and comes to land on the ground below. The minions and the girls start jumping from the ship. Agnes takes aim.
C: AGNES
D: Eat jelly, you purple freaks! Waaaaah! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 95.
N: Agnes' gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her a bit out of control. But she still manages to hit a number of Evil Minions. The tide is turning. Meanwhile, Gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He takes the remaining few out. El Macho kicks an evil minion at Gru, but he manages to hit it with jelly and transform it back to yellow. Gru holds his gun up to El Macho and gives him a threatening look.
C: GRU
D: It's over, El Macho. Now where is Lucy?
C: EL MACHO
D: Let me show you.
E: chuckles
N: He turns to a computer and pushes a button. A fountain stops spewing water and underneath it STEEL DOORS open from the ground. And out of them rises a ROCKET. Strapped to it is Lucy. Tied to a SHARK with TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OF DYNAMITE strapped to her. Gru is horrified. He GASPS.
C: LUCY
D: Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh? Yay!
E: unconvincingly
N: El Macho calls to Gru, brandishing a remote.
C: EL MACHO
D: One push of this button and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death. Only this time--it's for real!

D: No!
E: horrified
N: Dave swoops in on a rope and grabs the remote, Tarzan- style...
C: DAVE
D: Tally ho! DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 96.
N: But unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the remote. It bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on the ground. El Macho stares down Gru. Fire in his eyes.
C: EL MACHO
D: We could've ruled the world together, Gru. But now--you're gonna die.
N: He pulls out a vial of PX-41 and drinks it. Gru GASPS. El Macho transforms into a giant, purple, furry creature. He ROARS. Gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of ammunition. He then pulls out the FREEZE RAY and fires, encasing El Macho's fists in blocks of ice. El Macho GROWLS and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and knocking Gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding. Gru SCREAMS. The scaffolding tips over. El Macho grabs the scaffolding and holds it above his head, ready to crush Gru. Suddenly Gru pulls out Lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at Purple El Macho! The jolt of electricity has him shaking and dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally collapses on the ground.
C: GRU
D: Lipstick taser!
N: Lucy smiles at this.

D: I am not afraid of your jelly guns.
E: dazed
C: DR. NEFARIO
D: Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.
N: Dr. Nefario fires the Fart Gun directly into El Macho's face, causing him to pass out. The minions CHEER, firing their jelly guns into the air. DESPICABLE ME 2 CINCO & KEN DRAFT 97. One of the minions stands on top of El Macho and poses for a big game hunter-style photo. Dr. Nefario smiles for the camera as well. Gru runs toward the rocket.
C: LUCY
D: Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be fine. I have survived lots worse than this. Okay, that's not entirely true. I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!
E: beat
C: GRU
D: Don't worry--I will get you out of this!
N: Gru attempts to untie Lucy. And then sees Pollito has walked over to the remote. Gru and Lucy GASP. The chicken looks at Gru and Lucy, then pecks the button.
C: GRU
D: I really hate that chicken.
E: CONT'D
N: The rocket blasts off into the air. The Minions and Girls watch in horror as Gru and Lucy fly off on the rocket. EXT: SKY - CONTINUOUS Gru uses his knife to cut Lucy's ropes.

D: Are you kidding me?! Yes!
N: Gru smiles. Then realizes that the rocket is still careening toward the volcano. He grabs Lucy.
C: GRU
D: JUMP!!!
N: Gru and Lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket. The rocket plunges into the volcano. Gru and Lucy plummet through the air. KA-BLAAAAM!!! The volcano explodes in a massive tempest of fire and smoke and lava. The impact of the blast hits Gru and Lucy and sends them flying. SPLASH! They hit the water. BAM! BOOM! The volcano continues exploding. SPLASH! Gru emerges, soaking and out of breath. Fire and lava flying all around him. He can't find Lucy.
C: GRU
