N: A3 THE MARVEL LOGO. SMOLDERING, BEGINNING TO TURN ORANGE IN THE A3 HEAT AS WE TILT UP TO SEE- -FIRE. NOTHING BUT FIRE.
S: INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME
N: Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains. It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road. He awakens with a JOLT. Looks around.
C: THOR
D: Now I know what you're thinking. Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen? Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It's a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn't find any. That's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you.
E: then:
N: Reveal that he's talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains.
C: THOR
D: How much longer do you think we'll be here?
E: CONT'D
N: NOISE. Sounds of metal gears TURNING. Suddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK! Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in- BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 2.
S: INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS
N: A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it. Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.
C: SURTUR
D: Thor, Son of Odin.
E: O.S.
N: Thor's chain turns to reveal- -SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.
C: THOR
D: Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're still alive! I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago.
C: SURTUR
D: I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home.
C: THOR
D: You know, it's funny you should mention that because I've been having these terrible dreams of late. Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them.
C: SURTUR
D: Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--
C: THOR
D: Hang on. Hang on.
E: O.S.
N: Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.
C: THOR
D: I'll be back around shortly. I really feel like we were connecting there.
E: CONT'D
N: After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.
C: THOR
D: Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 3.
E: CONT'D
C: SURTUR
D: My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard's--
C: THOR
D: Oh, hang on. Give it a second.
N: Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.
C: THOR
D: I swear I'm not even moving, it's just doing this on its own. I'm really sorry. Okay, let me get this straight. You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house--
E: CONT'D then:
C: SURTUR
D: A mountain!
C: THOR
D: The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?
N: Surtur grins, evil.
C: SURTUR
D: Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless.
N: That elicits a concerned look from Thor.
C: THOR
D: Okay, so where is it? This crown?
C: SURTUR
D: This is my Crown, the source of my power.
N: Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..
C: THOR
D: Oh, that's a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow.
C: SURTUR
D: It's a crown. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 4.
C: THOR
D: Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.
N: Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.
C: SURTUR
D: But Ragnarok has already begun. You cannot stop it. I am Asgard's doom, and so are you. All will suffer, all will burn.
N: Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet, holding it so he and Thor are face to face.
C: THOR
D: That's intense. To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle. But it looks like I'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
C: SURTUR
D: You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?
N: Behind his back, Thor opens his hand. Sending out the SOS.
C: THOR
D: Because that's what heroes do.
N: Nothing happens. Thor appears annoyed at himself.
C: THOR
D: Wait, sorry. I didn't time that right. And, now!
E: CONT'D pause
N: BOOM! Thor's hammer Mjolnir CRASHES through the wall! Thor BREAKS FREE from his chains, GRABS Mjolnir, spins, and flies a distance away. He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur, smashing the giant in the face. Mjolnir returns.
C: SURTUR
D: You have made a grave mistake, Odinson. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 5.
N: THE WALLS COME ALIVE! A seemingly infinite swarm of FIRE DEMONS rally to Surtur's aid.
C: THOR
D: I make grave mistakes all the time. Everything seems to work out.
N: In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS. The fire demons SURGE FORWARD. Thor backs up, HAMMERING AWAY. He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and- -LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down. The resulting shockwave KNOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS. The Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash. Thor is now facing off with Surtur. Surtur thrusts his hands at Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE! Thor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD. The God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferocious hand-to-hand combat. Each landing power shots, sending sparks of both fire and electricity into the air. Thor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees. Thor then LAUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT. Descending hard, he uses all his power to- -LOP SURTUR'S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY! Surtur's body DEFLATES and COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones. Thor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find- -the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements flood in, filling the space to capacity. Recognizing the threat, Thor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.
C: THOR
D: Heimdall. I know it's been a while, but I could use a fast exit!
E: CONT'D
N: Nothing. Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.
C: THOR
D: ...Heimdall?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. THE OBSERVATORY - SAME
N: Heimdall is nowhere to be found. Instead, we meet SKURGE. He's bald, strong, mean looking, a little eager to be liked. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 6. At the moment, Skurge is entertaining two ASGARDIAN WOMEN.
C: SKURGE
D: Heimdall was an idiot. This job should have made him rich. Now, the job ain't easy, but it does have its benefits. The Bi-Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer. I mean it's all mine for the taking. Behold...my stuff.
E: beat
N: Skurge has drawn their attention to a pile of weapons and treasures he has stashed off to the side. He hefts up two M-16 assault rifles, trying to play it cool.
C: SKURGE
D: I'm particularly fond of these. I pulled `em out of a place on Midgard called Texas. I even named them. Des and Troy. You see, when you put them together...they destroy.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS
N: Having expected to have been Bi-Frosted out of there, Thor is OVERRUN BY THE GIANT WAVE OF FIRE DEMONS! The Fire Dragon BREAKS FREE of its chain. Realizing he's in trouble, Thor TAKES OFF, rocketing up to-
S: EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor CRASHES out of the ground and LANDS on a craggy surface. Disoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught. Thor's cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT the flames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.
C: THOR
D: Heimdall, come on.
N: THE GROUND SHAKES! Like an earthquake. Thor backs up as the ground begins to give way all around him. And then- -THE FEARSOME FIRE DRAGON BURSTS OUT OF THE GROUND! The dragon opens its tremendous jaws for an ear-splitting roar... BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 7. ...but Thor STUFFS Mjolnir into its mouth and lets go. THUD! The hammer DROPS, pinning the beast down by its bottom jaw. It THRASHES and GROWLS, trying to break free.
C: THOR
D: Stay. I'm running short on--
E: CONT'D looks up to the sky:
N: Thor notices that all around him the ground is CRUMBLING like a field of sinkholes giving way to more snarling Fire Demons!
C: THOR
D: -options.
E: CONT'D
N: Thor calls for Mjolnir and TAKES OFF. The dragon SCREECHES!
S: INT. THE OBSERVATORY - SAME
N: Skurge continues showing off for the ladies.
C: THOR
D: Heimdall?
E: O.S.
N: Behind Skurge the Bi-Frost starts MOVING. One of the women notices the Bi-Frost glowing.
C: ASGARDIAN WOMAN
D: Skurge, is that important?
N: Skurge turns and notices the Bi-Frost activity.
C: SKURGE
D: You girls are in for a treat.
N: Angle on Heimdall's sword, which has been sloppily cast aside in another pile of "stuff." Skurge hastily runs and grabs it.
S: EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor is FLYING at top speed, but that dragon is right on his heels! The fire demons LAUNCH flaming projectiles from below! Thor looks back, genuinely nervous. The dragon is OPENING its jaws to swallow Thor whole when- -Suddenly Bi-Frost OPENS! The portal surrounds Thor and engulfs the dragon's head! In an instant, they're gone. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 8. MAIN TITLE
S: INT. THE OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skurge has plunged Heimdall's sword into Bi-Frost. BOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed head of the dragon! SPLAT! Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore. The dragon's head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock. The women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory. Thor meanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He looks up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself.
C: SKURGE
D: Girls! Well well, look who decided to pop in. Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains.
E: beat
C: THOR
D: Who are you?
C: SKURGE
D: Don't you remember? I'm Skurge. We fought together on Vanaheim.
E: Thor doesn't
C: THOR
D: Right. Where's Heimdall?
C: SKURGE
D: That traitor. No one knows, he's a fugitive of the throne.
C: THOR
D: Traitor?
C: SKURGE
D: Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial. Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe.
N: Thor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead he starts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 9.
C: THOR
D: Sure.
C: SKURGE
D: Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
N: Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur. Skurge starts the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge.
S: A13 EXT. THEATER ENTRANCE - DAY A13
N: THOR arrives with Surtur's skull. There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched in the `savior' pose. Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron.
C: THOR
D: What the hell is that?
S: EXT. ASGARD - ROYAL TERRACE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER
N: LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY. In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute. Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: Oh, brother. This is it. I take my leave.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: You fool, you didn't listen!
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: I'm sorry.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: Lady Sif! Get help!
N: "Sif" awkwardly runs off. The "Warriors Three" watch sadly. A small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO.
C: ACTOR SIF
D: Somebody help! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 10.
N: In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show. Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: Sorry for all I've done.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: It's all right. Hold on.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: They'd be lucky to have you.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract. I just couldn't help myself.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: I know.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: I'm a trickster.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: So mischievous.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: It was a wonderful joke.
C: ODIN
D: Twas indeed hilarious.
E: to no-one in particular
C: ACTOR THOR
D: You are the savior of Asgard.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: Tell my story.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: I will.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: Build a statue for me. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 11.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: We will build a big statue for you.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.
C: ACTOR THOR
D: I will tell Father what you did here today.
N: Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him.
C: ACTOR LOKI
D: I didn't do it for him.
N: Actor Loki then "dies".
C: ACTOR THOR
D: Noooooo!!!
N: The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.
C: ACTOR ODIN
D: And so Loki died of his wounds, giving his life for ours. He fought back those disgusting dark elves. He brought peace to the realm.
N: He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.
C: ACTOR ODIN
D: Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago I found you on a frost-bitten battlefield.
E: CONT'D
N: Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman next to him is openly SOBBING at the play.
C: ACTOR ODIN
D: On that day, I did not yet see in you Asgard's savior. No. You were merely a little blue baby icicle... that melted this old fool's heart.
E: CONT'D
N: The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.
C: ODIN
D: Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
C: THOR
D: Father. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 12.
N: Odin sees Thor taking a knee. Curses under his breath:
C: ODIN
D: Oh, shit. My son! Thor has returned! Greetings my boy.
E: then, announcing
N: Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.
C: THOR
D: It's an interesting play. What's it called?
C: ODIN
D: The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him.
C: THOR
D: Indeed they should. I like that statue. A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though. A little less weasely. Less greasy maybe.
E: provoking
N: Odin sours, masking his agitation. Thor holds up the skull.
C: THOR
D: You know what this is?
E: CONT'D
C: ODIN
D: The skull of Surtur? That's a formidable weapon.
E: ADR
N: Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over.
C: THOR
D: Do me a favor. Lock this in a vault so it doesn't turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet.
C: ODIN
D: So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
N: Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.
C: THOR
D: Nope. I've been having this reocurring dream lately. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 13.
E: MORE
C: THOR
D: Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins...
E: CONT'D
C: ODIN
D: That's just a silly dream... Signs of an overactive imagination.
C: THOR
D: Possibly... but then I decide to go out there and investigate. And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos. Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.
C: ODIN
D: Well, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.
C: THOR
D: Of course, the freedom to be massacred.
C: ODIN
D: Yes, besides, I have been rather busy myself.
C: THOR
D: Watching theatre.
C: ODIN
D: Board meetings, and security council meetings...
C: THOR
D: You really going to make me do it?
C: ODIN
D: Do what?
N: Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance, GRABS Odin by the back of the neck. Odin's royal attendants GASP in shock. The Einherjar bodyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away.
C: THOR
D: You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.
N: Mjolnir stops mid-air and starts ROCKETING BACK. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 14.
C: THOR
D: Not even your face.
E: CONT'D
C: ODIN
D: You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this!
N: Mjolnir approaches at a terrifying speed as Odin struggles.
C: THOR
D: Then I'll see you on the other side...brother.
N: The jig is up. A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing:
C: LOKI
D: Alright, I yield!
N: Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Loki looks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on the scene, a little late to warn Loki.
C: SKURGE
D: Behold! Thor..Odinson.
C: LOKI
D: You had one job! Just the one.
C: THOR
D: Where's Odin?
C: LOKI
D: You just couldn't stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you. Asgard was prospering You've ruined everything. Ask them.
E: gestures to the crowd
N: Those who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier. Thor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge.
C: THOR
D: Where's father? Did you kill him?
C: LOKI
D: You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for!
N: Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki's chest. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 15.
C: LOKI
D: Ow-ow-ow! Alright! I know exactly where he is.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. SHADY ACRES NURSING HOME - MANHATTAN - DAY
N: A NURSING HOME sign on a brick wall. Suddenly the wall crumbles out of shot, revealing a demolition site. Reveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes. Thor carries an umbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit.
C: LOKI
D: I swear, I left him right here.
C: THOR
D: Right here on the sidewalk? Or right there, where the building that's being demolished? Great planning.
C: LOKI
D: How was I supposed to know? Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.
C: THOR
D: Then why do you dress like one?
C: LOKI
D: Hey.
C: THOR
D: I can't believe you're alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.
C: LOKI
D: I'm honored.
N: COLLEGE GIRL 2 Ask him. COLLEGE GIRL 1 Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 16.
C: THOR
D: Sure. Start figuring out where he is.
E: to Loki:
N: COLLEGE GIRL 1 Oh, my god. COLLEGE GIRL 2 Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
C: THOR
D: She didn't dump me, you know. I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
N: Thor notices something going on around Loki.
C: THOR
D: What's this, what are you doing!?
E: CONT'D
N: Loki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLOW BENEATH HIM! A circle of ancient symbols.
C: LOKI
D: This... isn't me.
N: WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was. Thor pokes the business card.
C: THOR
D: Loki?
N: He picks up the card. It reads: 177A Bleecker Street Thor picks up the card and - WHOOSH!
S: EXT. SANCTUM SANTORUM - DAY
N: Thor approaches 177A Bleecker Street. He knocks ONCE, TWICE, and then WHOOSH!

C: THOR
D: So earth has wizards now?
C: STRANGE
D: The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts."
C: THOR
D: Alright wizard, who are you? Why should I care?
C: STRANGE

D: Tea?
E: CONT'D
N: Thor now has a cup of tea in his hand.
C: THOR
D: I don't drink tea.
C: STRANGE
D: What do you drink?
C: THOR
D: Not tea.
N: Thor now has a stein of beer in his hand. He drinks it throughout the scene, but it always stays full. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 18.
C: STRANGE
D: So I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother Loki is one of these beings.
C: THOR
D: He's a worthy inclusion.
C: STRANGE
D: Then why bring him here?
C: THOR
D: We're looking for my father.
C: STRANGE
D: So. If you were to tell you where Odin was, all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?
C: THOR
D: Promptly.
C: DR. STRANGE
D: Great. Then I'll help you.
C: THOR
D: If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?
C: DR. STRANGE
D: I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed. Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile. And you don't have a phone.
E: beat
C: THOR
D: No, I don't have a phone, but you could have sent an electronic letter. It's called an email.
C: STRANGE
D: Yeah, do you have a computer?
C: THOR
D: No. What for? Anyway, my father is no longer in exile. So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 19.
E: beat
C: DR. STRANGE
D: Gladly. He's in Norway.
N: Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book- case. Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.
C: STRANGE
D: I'm just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.
N: Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.
C: STRANGE
D: Nope.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange's work station. Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he has magically brought it across the room as well.
C: STRANGE
D: Oh, we don't need that.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly Thor is back across the room. Books fall off the shelf and Thor's beer spills. He is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.
C: THOR
D: Will you stop doing that?
C: STRANGE
D: I need just one strand of your hair.
C: THOR
D: Let me explain something, my hair is not to be meddled wi-!
N: Strange is behind Thor, he plucks a strand of hair. Strange extends the hair, infuses it with magic, does a few gestures that create a BRIGHT LIGHT and suddenly-
S: A20 INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM - FRONT STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS A20
N: Bottom of the stairs. Strange is standing. Thor is rolling down the stairs. A magic portal leading into a peaceful meadow has opened beside Strange.

C: DR. STRANGE
D: He's waiting for you.
E: re: the portal
C: THOR
D: All right.
C: STRANGE

E: CONT'D
N: Finally the umbrella flies into his hand.
C: THOR
D: I suppose I'll need my brother back.
E: CONT'D
C: DR. STRANGE

D: ...I have been falling...for thirty minutes!
C: DR. STRANGE
D: You can handle him from here.
E: to Thor:
C: THOR

C: THOR
D: Loki. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 21.
N: Loki DRAWS a dagger, ready to attack Strange.
C: LOKI
D: ..you think you're some kind of sorcerer? Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...
C: DR. STRANGE
D: Bye-bye.
N: Strange GESTURES with both hands and- -WHOOSH! PULLS the magic portal over them. Just like that, Thor and Loki are gone.
S: EXT. CLIFFS - DAY
N: Beautiful, undisturbed nature. We hear the ocean nearby. LOKI lands on the ground, portal closes behind them.
C: THOR
D: Father?
N: A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below. It is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes. The boys approach him quickly.
C: ODIN
D: Look at this place. It's beautiful.
C: THOR
D: Father, it's us.
C: ODIN
D: My sons. I've been waiting for you.
N: Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son.
C: THOR
D: I know. We've come to take you home.
C: ODIN
D: Home, yes. Your mother, she calls me. Do you hear it?
N: Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 22.
C: THOR
D: Loki, lift your magic.
N: Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens. But Odin smiles.
C: ODIN
D: Took me quite a while to break free from your spell. Frigga would have been proud.
N: Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor staring at him, anger building. Odin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him.
C: ODIN
D: Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.
E: CONT'D
N: Odin sits, out of breath, weak. His sons sit beside him.
C: THOR
D: I know that we failed you, but we can make this right.
C: ODIN
D: I failed you. It is upon us...Ragnarok.
E: beat
C: THOR
D: No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.
C: ODIN
D: No. It has already begun. She's coming. My life was all that held her back, but my time has come. I cannot keep her away any longer.
C: THOR
D: Father, who are you talking about?
C: ODIN
D: The Goddess of Death. Hela. My first born. Your sister.
E: faces Thor
N: That hits Thor hard. Loki can't believe what he's hearing.
C: THOR
D: ...what? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 23.
C: ODIN
D: Her violent appetites grew beyond my control. I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away. She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.
C: THOR
D: Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together.
C: ODIN
D: No we won't. I'm on a different path now. This you must face alone.
E: takes Thor's hand
N: Odin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe.
C: ODIN
D: I love you my sons.
E: CONT'D
N: For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes.
C: ODIN
D: Look at that.
E: CONT'D
N: Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.
C: ODIN
D: Remember this place. Home.
E: CONT'D
N: A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that- -ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST. THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED. A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin. The sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP. Thor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning with rage. Loki takes a step back.
C: LOKI
D: Brother.
N: Thor faces Loki. Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.
C: THOR
D: This was your doing.
N: CRACK! Behind them a black portal SPLITS OPEN! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 24. Thor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardian armor (with Mjolnir). Loki changes into his armor as well. A piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out of the portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA. Hela takes a second to consider her surroundings. Then:
C: HELA
D: So he's gone? That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.
E: beat
N: A tense moment as they stare each other down.
C: THOR
D: You must be Hela. I'm Thor, son of Odin.
C: HELA
D: Really, you don't look like him.
C: LOKI
D: Perhaps we can reach an arrangement.
C: HELA
D: You sound like him.
N: Loki shifts nervously. Thor's grip tightens on Mjolnir.
C: HELA
D: Kneel.
E: CONT'D
C: LOKI
D: Beg your pardon?
N: Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade.
C: HELA
D: Kneel...before your Queen.
C: THOR
D: I don't think so.
N: Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela... - THUD - the mighty hammer comes to a cold stop, against Hela's hand. Thor is shocked. He stretches out his hands, trying to call Mjolnir back to him. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 25. The hammer trembles in Hela's hand, like a mini game of tug-o- war. But ultimately Hela keeps possession.
C: THOR
D: It's not possible.
E: CONT'D
C: HELA
D: Darling, you have no idea what's possible.
N: HELA SHATTERS THOR'S HAMMER. The blast of Mjolnir's destruction sends a wave of energy through Thor and Loki who brace themselves against the impact. Thor is stupefied. In shock. He looks up to see Hela is running her hands back over her head to create the terrifying battle headdress. Loki's reaction is more panic. He stands and calls up:
C: LOKI
D: Bring us back!
C: THOR
D: No!!
N: Hela CHARGES Thor and Loki as- -WHOOSH! The Bi-Frost envelopes all of them.
S: INT. BI-FROST - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor and Loki ZOOM UPWARDS, held inside this celestial beam warping them towards Asgard. Loki and Thor look down to see... Hela is in the Bi-Frost, behind them and CATCHING UP. Loki turns and throws TWO DAGGERS at her. They find their mark, stalling her for a second. But she PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH Loki, KNOCKING HIM OUT OF THE BI-FROST. Gone in an instant.
C: THOR
D: Loki!
N: Hela projects a jet black grappling hook and GRABS HOLD of Thor. Drawing him to her, preparing to finish him off. Thor pulls up his legs, and KICKS Hela with both feet. This effectively dislodges him from her grasp but also... ...KNOCKS THOR OUT OF THE BI-FROST! Now both he and Loki are gone. If they aren't dead, then God knows where they went. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 26.
S: INT. THE OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS
N: VOLSTAGG has a grip on Heimdall's sword, manning Bi-Frost's controls. Behind him FANDRAL is overseeing Skurge, who is mopping up the dragon guts. BOOM! Hela emerges with thunderous impact. Fandral and Volstagg draw their weapons, preparing to engage.
C: VOLSTAGG
D: Who are you!? What have you done with Thor?
N: Hela fires TWO BLACK DAGGERS, each one dropping its target to the ground. Hela then walks forward and-
C: HELA
D: I'm Hela.
N: -BRUTALLY KILLS FANDRAL AND VOLSTAGG! Hela sees Skurge. Approaches calmly, a vision of death. With Hela only a few feet from him, Skurge cowers. Pause.
C: SKURGE
D: I'm just a janitor.
N: Skurge ever-so-slightly peers up at her.
C: HELA
D: You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts. How would you like a job?
N: Hela looks out upon Asgard as Skurge rises behind her.
S: EXT. ASGARD - THE MOUNTAINS - SAME
N: A mysterious HOODED FIGURE watches Hela's arrival at the Observatory and begins a steady descent towards the city.
S: EXT. SAKAAR - THE WASTELAND SHORE - DAY
N: SUPER WIDE: A sky full of WORMHOLES. Thor, only a spec at this distance, SHOOTS out of one of these wormholes. He HITS the surface, causing a CLOUD of dust. Find Thor on his back surrounded by strange colorful space wreckage. Looking up, Thor sees a large metal object falling from a different wormhole! He rolls out of the way. THUD! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 27. Thor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris. Thor reaches the top of the dune and finds himself looking down on A BEACH in a strange WASTELAND. Camera scans a filthy dune littered with SPACE JUNK. Out across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms. A loud noise draws Thor's attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR "SCRAPPER" SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked humanoids. The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC. A Scrapper notices Thor, then signals to his crew.
C: LEAD SCRAPPER
D: Are you a fighter or are you food?
C: THOR
D: I'm just passing through.
C: LEAD SCRAPPER
D: It is food. On your knees.
N: Thor reaches out to summon Mjolnir. A reflex. Nothing. The LEAD SCRAPPER levels a MAGNO-RIFLE at Thor and WHAP! A solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles. Thor tries to swat them away but they keep coming. The rest of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs. WHOOSH! A second ship arrives, landing nearby. It's cool, sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG. It is also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC. The FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER #142 (S142 for short) - a beautiful and ruthless asskicker. S142 lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it. She finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship. SCRAPPER #142 He's MINE. She walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH. She's PLASTERED. The Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 28. SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D) Wait! S142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets. SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D) Wait! He's mine. So if you want him, you go through me. The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons.
C: SCRAPPER
D: But we've already got him.
N: S142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate. SCRAPPER #142 Alright then I guess I go through you.
C: LEAD SCRAPPER
D: More food.
N: She holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery... ...Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE. She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than tiny pieces of litter covering the beach. Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S142 casually GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her.
C: THOR
D: Thank you.
N: From her belt S142 FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES into Thor's NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD. She holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand screaming squirrels. He hits the ground, stunned. S142 DRAGS Thor towards her ship. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 29.
S: INT. WARSONG SHIP - DAY
N: Thor's face SMUSHED up against glass. His eyes are open. Thor's POV - THE CAPITAL - an eclectic city composed of salvaged items from all over the universe. Thor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath Warsong's COCKPIT. He looks up to see S142 piloting the ship. Thor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him. SCRAPPER #142 This is Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss. I've got something special.
C: THOR
D: Hey! Where are you taking me?
N: S142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt.
C: THOR
D: Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.
E: CONT'D
N: SCRAPPER #142 Many apologies, your majesty. S142 ZAPS him and guides her ship towards a COLOSSAL TOWER.
S: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: Hela, headdress retracted, hair down, her beautiful face fully visible. We do not see who she is talking to.
C: HELA
D: It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.
N: REVEAL THE ARMIES OF ASGARD FACING DOWN HELA. Standing in front is HOGUN, sword and shield out.
C: HELA
D: I am Hela, Odin's first born, Commander of the legions of Asgard, the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 30.
E: CONT'D pause for effect MORE
C: HELA
D: My father is dead. As are the princes. You're welcome. We were once the seat of absolute power in the Cosmos. Our supremacy was unchallenged, yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms. Our destiny is to rule over all others. And I am here to restore that power. Kneel before me...and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.
E: CONT'D then:
N: THE E-GUARDS GET INTO ATTACK FORMATION.
C: HOGUN
D: Whoever you are... whatever you've done, surrender now! Or we will show you know mercy.
C: HELA
D: Whoever I am? Did you listen to a word I said?
C: HOGUN
D: This is your last warning!
C: HELA
D: I thought you'd be happy to see me.
N: Hela forms her headdress.
C: HELA
D: Fine.
E: CONT'D
N: The Asgardian archers LOOSE DOZENS OF ARROWS, but- -Hela advances confidently, DESTROYS the SHIPS and SOARS INTO THE EINHERJAR! In a symphony of spectacular terror, Hela proceeds to DECIMATE the entire regiment. A tornado of carnage, a legendary massacre.
S: EXT. BELOW THE RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME
N: While Hela slaughters up above, we tilt up from a boat, moored at the base of the Observatory, to see the mysterious figure from earlier is now SCALING the rocks towards the top.
S: INT. THE OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS
N: Now silhouetted in the entrance way, the figure scans the Observatory. His gaze falls on- BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 31. -Bi-Frost's controls. Specifically Heimdall's sword.
S: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - CONTINUOUS
N: It's eerily quiet. CLOSE on Hela scanning the battlefield. 100+ slain Einherjar at her feet. ANGLE on Skurge as he steps forward - awe, admiration, fear.
C: HELA
D: Oh, I've missed this. Still, it's a shame. Good soldiers dying for nothing...all because they couldn't see the future. Sad. Oh! Look, still alive.
E: then she sees:
N: Reveal Hogun, severely injured but staggering to his feet, resilient.
C: HELA
D: Change of heart?
E: CONT'D
N: Hogun draws a dagger as a last ditch attack.
C: HOGUN
D: Go back to whatever cave you crept out of you evil demoness!
N: Hela IMPALES Hogun on a spike. She turns to Skurge.
C: HELA
D: Let's go see my palace.
N: Skurge stares at Hogun before following Hela towards the palace.
S: A32 INT. DARK TUNNEL - DAY A32
N: THOR, strapped to the chair, suddenly finds himself slowly moving forward. After a beat- -the walls LIGHT UP and a SOOTHING VOICE speaks to him.
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: Fear not, for you are found. You are home, and there is no going back. No one leaves this place.
E: V.O.
N: Thor STRUGGLES against his restraints. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 32.
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: But what is this place? The answer in Sakaar.
E: V.O.
N: The tunnel walls show images of Sakaar's place in the Cosmos.
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: Surrounded by cosmic gateways, Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.
E: V.O.
N: Images of the wormholes that cover Sakaar's atmosphere.
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things. Like you. But here on Sakaar, you are significant. You are valuable. Here, you are loved.
E: V.O.
C: THOR
D: What...the hell?
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.
E: V.O.
N: Images of the Grandmaster, in silhouette, arriving on Sakaar.
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: He is the original. The first lost, and the first found. The creator of Sakaar and the father of the Contest of Champions.
E: V.O.
N: Images of the arena where aliens battle to the death.
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: Where once you were nothing, now you are something. You are the property of the Grandmaster. Congratulations! You will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds.
E: V.O. then:
N: Images around the tunnel begin speeding up. Chaos, violence, and confusion mixed in with Grandmaster's face. Thor, already bewildered, looks on the verge of panic.
C: SOOTHING VOICE
D: Prepare yourself. Prepare yourself. You are now meeting the Grandmaster. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 33.
E: V.O.
N: Thor SCREAMS!
S: INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
N: Suddenly Thor is somewhere else, surrounded weirdos and insanely dressed palace guards. His scream dies down self-consciously. A musical beat PLAYS in the background. THE GRANDMASTER, a tall mysterious man in golden robes. He is looking right at us. He doesn't know what to make of us. He's curious, thrilled, revolted, and titillated. Pulling back we see TOPAZ, his trusty guard, at his side. Two GOLDEN LADIES loiter off to the side. Other strange guests can be seen in the background. Grandmaster just stares. S142 stands beside Grandmaster. Finally:
C: GRANDMASTER
D: He's wonderful. It is a he?
E: then:
N: Reveal S142 standing beside Thor. SCRAPPER #142 It's a he.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Yeah. I love when you come to visit 142, you bring me the best stuff. Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142...what do I always say? "She is the..." and it starts with a B.
E: to Topaz:
C: TOPAZ
D: Trash.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: No, not trash. Were you waiting just to call her that? It doesn't start with a "B."
C: TOPAZ
D: Booze hag. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 34.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: I'm so sorry. No, "best." I was thinking about "best." Because I always say you're the best. She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know.
E: to S142:
C: TOPAZ
D: You say that every time she's here.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: What have you brought today? Tell me.
N: SCRAPPER #142 A contender.
C: THOR
D: A what?
C: GRANDMASTER
D: I need to go closer. I want a closer look at this. Can you take us closer? Thank you.
N: Grandmaster advances on Thor. Examining him closely and strangely. Then:
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Pay this lady.
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: Just wait a damn minute. I'm not for sale.
N: Using all his might, Thor breaks out of his shackles, but- -S142 ZAPS him again. Paralyzed by superheated veins.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Man. He is a fighter.
N: SCRAPPER #142 I'd take 10 million.
C: TOPAZ
D: Tell her she's dreaming.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: For heaven's sake, transfer the units. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 35.
N: Topaz transfers S142 the units. Without sympathy or ceremony, S142 exits.
C: THOR
D: You'll pay for this!
N: SCRAPPER #142 No, I got paid for this. Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT. He gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go. Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a wand to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster around as he speaks.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Here's what I wanna know. Who are you?
C: THOR
D: I am the God of THUNDER!!!
N: Thor THRUSTS his arms into the air but only a tiny bit of static electricity POPS within Thor's hands.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Wow. I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that like...sparkles?
C: TOPAZ
D: We located your cousin.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Oh good! Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this.
E: to Thor:
N: Grandmaster moves Thor's chair to another section where- -COUSIN CARLO is waiting. He's strapped to a chair like Thor, and he is terrified.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: There he is. Hey, cuz. We almost couldn't find you. What, have you been hiding?
E: CONT'D
N: Cousin Carlo looks at Thor, cowering in fear. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 36.

D: So...
C: COUSIN CARLO
D: Please. I'm sorry.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Carlo... I pardon you.
C: COUSIN CARLO
D: Thank you. Thank you.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: You're officially pardoned...from life.
N: Grandmaster casually takes Topaz's Sakaarian Guard staff and JABS it into his cousin's mid-section- -CAUSING ALL OF HIS FLESH TO MELT OFF HIS SKELETON! Carlo SHRIEKS IN PAIN before his vocal cords melt. Thor looks on, in shock.
C: THOR
D: Oh, my god!
N: Liquid Carlo spreads towards Grandmaster.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping in it. Look out!
C: THOR
D: Oh, the smell.
E: repulsed
C: GRANDMASTER
D: What does it smell like?
C: TOPAZ
D: Burnt toast.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: What happened to my manners? I haven't properly introduced myself. Come on. Follow me.
N: Grandmaster gives Topaz back her staff. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 37. Grandmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP OF MUSICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the music thus far). Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor. Grandmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption, riffing a melody over the existing music.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: My name is Grandmaster. I preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions. People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it. And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast. What do you say to that?
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: We're not friends, and I don't give a shit about your games! I'm going back to Asgard!
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Ass-gard? One, two, three, four.
E: amused then:
N: Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING. Grandmaster's guards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC. Thor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacle unfolding around him. In doing so, he zeroes in on one particular group of VIPS, specifically... ...LOKI! He's lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.
C: LOKI
D: There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me. At that moment, I let go.
C: THOR
D: Loki!? Loki! Over here!
N: Loki notices Thor. Blanches a little. Sidles closer so as to speak to Thor without looking like he's speaking to Thor.
C: LOKI
D: Excuse me one second.
C: THOR
D: Loki! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 38.
N: Loki hustles over to Thor, SHUSHING him.
C: LOKI
D: What? You're alive?
C: THOR
D: Yes, of course I'm alive.
C: LOKI
D: What are you doing here?
C: THOR
D: What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm stuck in this stupid chair. Where's your chair?
C: LOKI
D: I didn't get a chair.
C: THOR
D: Get me out of this one.
C: LOKI
D: I can't.
C: THOR
D: What?
C: LOKI
D: I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.
C: THOR
D: Oh, he's crazy!
C: LOKI
D: I've gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago.
C: THOR
D: Weeks ago? I just got here.
N: Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: What are you whispering about?
N: Both Thor and Loki react, startled.
C: GRANDMASTER

E: CONT'D MORE
C: GRANDMASTER
D: On any other world, I'd be like, millions of years old. But here on Sakaar...
E: CONT'D

C: GRANDMASTER
D: In any case, you know this... You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: God of Thunder. Tell him.
C: LOKI
D: I've never met this man in my life.
C: THOR
D: He's my brother.
C: LOKI
D: Adopted.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Is he any kind of a fighter?
N: Loki shrugs, gives the universal gesture for "so-so."
C: THOR
D: You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Now listen to that. He's threatening me. Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal. If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...
C: THOR
D: Asgard.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Any contender who defeats my champion, their freedom they shall win.
C: THOR
D: Fine. Then point me in the direction of whoever's ass I have to kick.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: That's what I call, contender! Direction would be this way, Lord. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 40.
C: THOR
D: Loki!
N: Guards arrive. They haul Thor up and escort him out.
S: INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT
N: Thor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alien prisoners are lurking in the back. The thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up and immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. The door doesn't budge, not even a little. Behind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up.
C: KORG
D: Hey! Take it easy man! Over here. The pile of rocks waving at you. Yeah I'm actually a thing, I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of rocks, as you can see, but don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors. Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you. This is my very good friend over here, Miek. He's an insect and has knives for hands.
E: Thor looks back GIGGLES to himself
N: MIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello by doing some karate moves.
C: THOR
D: You're a Kronan, aren't you?
C: KORG
D: That I am.
C: THOR
D: How'd you end up in here?
C: KORG
D: Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn't print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 41.
E: MORE
C: KORG
D: Except for my mom and her boyfriiend, who I hate. As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster. But I'm actually organizing another revolution. I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that. Do you reckon you'd be interested?
E: CONT'D secretive
N: Thor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back around behind Korg.
C: THOR
D: How did you...
C: KORG
D: Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle. But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.
C: THOR
D: This doesn't make any sense.
C: KORG
D: No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense.
C: THOR
D: Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's Champion?
C: KORG
D: Doug has. Doug! Oh, right, Doug's dead. That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
E: realizes
C: THOR
D: What about you? You're made of rocks.
C: KORG
D: Perishable rocks. There you go. Another one gone. Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot. Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 42.
E: a pebble FALLS OFF
C: THOR
D: Yes I am. Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.

S: A36 INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS A36
N: Moving down the throne room corridor we see- -SEVERAL DEAD EINHERJAR GUARDS. One guy is still alive, desperately trying to crawl away. SHLNK! A black blade finishes him off. Reveal HELA and SKURGE looking down at the carnage. Hela directs her attention to FRESCOS ON THE CEILING. Like the Sistine Chapel, except these depict Asgard's shining influence on the Nine Realms. Bountiful harvests, shepherds with full flocks, common folk throwing parades for Asgard's army, etc.
C: HELA
D: Does no one remember me? Has no one been taught our history? Look at these lies. Goblets and garden parties? Peace treaties?
E: awaiting an answer
N: Hela leads them towards the throne.
C: HELA
D: Odin... proud to have it... ashamed of how he got it.
E: CONT'D
N: Hela FIRES SPIKES into the ceiling, RIPPING DOWN plaster. Beneath the surface are older Frescos. These ones are far more dark and sinister. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 43. Soldiers in battle. Blood.

C: THOR
D: I really wish I had my hammer.
C: KORG
D: Hammer? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 48.

D: You rode a hammer?
C: THOR
D: No, I didn't ride the hammer.
C: KORG
D: The hammer rode you on your back?
C: THOR
D: No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the...
C: KORG
D: Oh my God. The hammer pulled you off?
C: THOR
D: The ground. It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly. Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.

C: THOR
D: That's a nice way of putting it.

C: THOR
D: My God, you're a Valkyrie. I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...until I found out that you were all women. There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women. Sometimes a little too much. Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation. I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors. It's about time.
E: CONT'D
N: SCRAPPER #142 Are you done?
C: WARDEN
D: Lord of Thunder, you're up.

C: VALKYRIE
D: And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway.
N: Despite her denial, Thor has clearly hit a nerve. And from now on we will refer to Scrapper #142 as VALKYRIE. Valkyrie takes her booze and walks away. Thor is dragged away, passing Korg and the other prisoners.

This freaks him out, which results in startled thrashing. That freaks out the two Gladiator nurses, which results in them RUNNING AWAY. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 59. Thor starts to get up, but then winces. He moves slowly. He's in a GIANT ROOM with stark graphic patterns on the walls. With a few achy grimaces, Thor stands up and wanders around. There's furniture, large cushions, and a sleeping area enclosed by the SKULL of a giant beast. NOISE behind him. Thor follows the noise to find- Hulk having eased himself into a large steaming JACUZZI. Thor looks at him quizzically. Hulk isn't angry. He's RELAXED, but he's not turning into Banner.

S: AA57 INT. STREETS OF ASGARD - SAME AA57
N: Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first, Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows. Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees. After a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause. Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.
C: HEIMDALL
D: I see you. But you are far away.
C: THOR
D: What's going on here?
C: HEIMDALL
D: Come see for yourself.
N: Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley and DASHES down the street. Thor follows... ...but then stops. Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY OF ASGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight. Down the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slow down. He sees something. Ushers them into an alcove. Thor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by another roving patrol of Hela's Butchers. Heimdall again motions for Thor to "shh" until the threat has passed. Then:
C: HEIMDALL
D: I'm providing refuge in a stronghold build by our ancestors. But if the garrison falls our only escape will is Bi-Frost.
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
C: HEIMDALL
D: We won't last long if we stay.
N: Thor LOOKS OUT on a ravaged Asgard, heartsick. Hold on the devastated Realm as: BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 64.
C: HEIMDALL
D: She draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger everyday.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Back to Thor and Heimdall.
C: HEIMDALL
D: Come on.
E: CONT'D
N: As Heimdall quickly leads refugees down a safe pathway:
C: HEIMDALL
D: Hela is ravenous. If I let her leave, she'll consume the Nine Realms and all the cosmos.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Turns back to Thor, approaches him.
C: HEIMDALL
D: We need you.
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: I'm working on it, but I don't even really know where the hell I am.
N: Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously. Spot Heimdall.
C: HEIMDALL
D: You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.
C: THOR
D: Which one?
N: Heimdall RIPS into the attacking Butchers, CUTTING them down.
C: HEIMDALL
D: The big one!
N: WHOOSH! SUDDENLY THOR'S GONE! BLACK. After slashing through the Butchers, Heimdall moves towards the house where he hid the family... and then abruptly stops. Heimdall turns slightly. He sees something. BINOCULARS POV: Heimdall looking right at us, the Bi-Frost sword visible in his hand. Reveal Skurge on a palace tower balcony, surveilling the city with Asgardian E-noculars. Skurge lowers the E-noculars. There is conflict on his face. He knows that he should report this to Hela immediately...yet he doesn't spring into action. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 65.
S: INT. HULK'S WARRIOR SUITE - NIGHT
N: Thor absentmindedly fidgets with his Obedience Disk. THUD! THUD! THUD! ...resonates around the room. Hulk steps up to Thor, looking inquisitively down at him.
C: HULK
D: Thor sad.
C: THOR
D: Shut up.
N: Hulk HITS Thor, bullying him into opening up.
C: HULK
D: THOR SAD!!!
N: Thor hops up, YELLS in Hulk's face. Paces around.
C: THOR
D: I'm not sad, you idiot. I'm pissed off! Angry. I lost my father. I lost my hammer.
N: THUD! THUD! He turns to see Hulk punching his pillow. Hulk stops. Stares.
C: HULK
D: Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
C: THOR
D: You're not even listening.
N: Thor KICKS a random helmet.
C: HULK
D: Don't kick stuff.
C: THOR
D: You're being a really bad friend.
C: HULK
D: You bad friend!
C: THOR
D: You know what we call you?
C: HULK
D: No.
C: THOR
D: We call you the stupid Avenger. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 66.
C: HULK
D: You're tiny Avenger!
N: Hulk throws a shield that nearly decapitates Thor.
C: THOR
D: What, are you crazy?
C: HULK
D: Yes.
C: THOR
D: You know what? Earth does hate you.
N: Hulk gets sad. Wanders over to his bed to mope. Thor realizes he went to far. Joins Hulk on the bed.
C: HULK
D: No.
C: THOR
D: I'm sorry I said those things. You're not the stupid Avenger. Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
C: HULK
D: It's okay.
C: THOR
D: You just can't go around throwing shields at people. Could have killed me.
C: HULK
D: I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time. Hulk always, always angry.
C: THOR
D: I know. We're the same, you and I. We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
C: HULK
D: Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
C: THOR
D: We're kind of both like fire. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 67.
C: HULK
D: But Hulk like real fire. Hulk like raging fire. Thor like smoldering fire.
C: THOR
D: Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
T: TIME CUT: Morning.
N: BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! We follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite. Hulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's so hard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns. Reveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave... Valkyrie and Hulk face off.
C: HULK
D: Angry girl!
N: Val bounds forward and gives The Incredible Hulk a big hug. Hulk laughs and then begins playfully roughhousing with Val.
C: VALKYRIE
D: What's going on? What do you...?
N: Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes a little. Like, "I done bad." Turns back to Thor:
C: VALKYRIE
D: You're so thick-headed that you can't tell when someone's hiding all the way across the universe and wants to be left alone?
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: We need to talk.
C: VALKYRIE
D: No, you want to talk to me.
N: Valkyrie turns to leave.
C: THOR
D: I need her to stay.
E: to Hulk:
N: Valkyrie is at the exit when the UPPER JAWBONE of Hulk's massive skull bed CRASHES into frame, BLOCKING the doorway. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 68. Val shoots an annoyed sneer at Hulk. Hulk SNORTS back.
C: HULK
D: Stay! Please?
N: Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max. Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again. Valkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENED BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts it down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.
C: VALKYRIE
D: All right. Here's the deal. I'll listen to you till this is empty.
N: She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING.
C: THOR
D: Asgard is in danger and people are dying. We need to get back there. I need your help...wow.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Finished. Bye.
N: She has indeed finished. She goes to leave.
C: THOR
D: Odin is dead.
N: Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her silence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization.
C: THOR
D: Hela, the Goddess of Death has invaded Asgard.
E: CONT'D
C: VALKYRIE
D: If Hela's back then Asgard is already lost.
C: THOR
D: I'm going to stop her.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Alone?
C: THOR
D: Nope. I'm putting together a team. It's me, you, and the big guy. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 69.
C: HULK
D: No team. Only Hulk.
C: THOR
D: It's me and you.
C: VALKYRIE
D: I think it's only you.
C: THOR
D: Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie are legend, elite warriors of Asgard. You are sworn to defend the throne.
C: VALKYRIE
D: I'm not getting dragged into another one of Odin's family squabbles.
C: THOR
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: VALKYRIE
D: Your sister. Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.
N: Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT. Val picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.
C: VALKYRIE
D: When it grew beyond Odin's control, she massacred everyone in the palace and tried to seize the throne. When she tried to escape her banishment, he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back. I only survived because... Look, I already faced her once back when I believed in the throne, and it cost me everything. THAT'S what's wrong with Asgard. The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.
E: CONT'D trails off, brooding
N: Pause. Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comforting hand on her shoulder.
C: THOR
D: I agree.
N: Val SNATCHES his hand. They are close, face to face. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 70.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Don't get familiar.
C: THOR
D: I agree. That's why I turned down the throne. But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people. They're dying and they're you're people, too.
N: Val SHOVES him away. Thor stumbles back.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Forget it. I have.
C: THOR
D: Okay.
E: nods, understanding
C: VALKYRIE
D: Okay.
C: THOR
D: Good. Great.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Great.
C: THOR
D: Thank you.
C: VALKYRIE
D: For what?
C: THOR
D: For this.
N: Reveal that Thor has lifted the fob device off Val's belt!
C: THOR
D: Didn't see that did you?
E: CONT'D
N: Thor presses the button and ALL THE OBEDIENCE DISKS EMBEDDED IN HIS NECK AND BELT POWER DOWN! Confident smirk.
C: THOR
D: There... that's better. You know, go ahead. Stay here and get drunk and enslave people for that lunatic. Keep drinking. Keep hiding. But me... BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 71.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Thor gestures for Hulk to toss him the ball. Hulk does.
C: THOR
D: I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them. Because that's what...
E: CONT'D
N: Thor HURLS IT at the MAIN WINDOW - It bounces off, hitting Thor in the face. He stands, facing Valkyrie.
C: THOR
D: Because that's what heroes do.
E: CONT'D
N: Thor then SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW! Hulk STANDS...
C: HULK
D: Friend Stay!
S: EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY
N: Thor is sliding down the SIDE of the GRANDMASTER'S TOWER. He LAUNCHES HIMSELF OFF THE BUILDING and hurtles downward, LANDING casually on the street below. Finally free.
S: EXT. THE STREETS OF SAKAAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor is HAULING ASS. Never slowing down, Thor keeps the top of the arena in sight. A few blocks back: Hulk is in pursuit. He's BUMPING people, SWATTING vehicles out of the way, just being a menace. On Sakaar, the citizens APPLAUD for him! Even when Hulk DEMOLISHES a man's food cart, the man CHEERS Hulk on!
S: EXT. MASSIVE ALIEN JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor SPRINTS in. Looks around. Man, this place is big. He RUNS down aisles of crushed and stripped spacecrafts, a giant smelter, and then into what looks like a used car lot. And then he sees it. The Quinjet!
S: INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor enters and rushes to the controls. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 72.

C: QUINJET
D: Welcome, Point Break.
E: V.O.
N: CAH-RUNCH! Hulk BARGES IN through the Quinjet door! The Hulk approaches, scowling. Any metal that stands in his way PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet's console. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 73.
C: HULK
D: Friend stay!
C: THOR
D: No, no, no!
N: As Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet.
C: HULK
D: Stay!
C: THOR
D: Stop! Stop breaking everything!
C: HULK
D: Don't go!
N: Thor triggers a message on the flight console.
C: NATASHA
D: Nice work, big guy. We don't know where Ultron's headed, but you're going very high, very fast.
E: V.O.
N: Hulk stops short. His whole demeanor changes. Thor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorded message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console.
C: NATASHA
D: ...So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode...
E: V.O.
N: Hulk is now right up against the console screen.
C: NATASHA
D: ...So I need you to help me out. Okay? I need you to...
E: V.O.
C: HULK
D: No! No, Banner!
N: Hulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whole body warping. Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING his head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it... ...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back and forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet. And then, calm. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 74. Thor rushes to Banner's side to help ease the transition.
C: THOR
D: Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all right, Banner? Sun's going down. Sun's going down. That's it, breathe. I won't hurt you. Sun's going down.
C: BANNER
D: ...Thor?
C: THOR
D: Yeah.
N: Banner is groggy, disoriented. Thoughts, memories, and observations begin to flood his brain randomly.
C: BANNER
D: What happened to your hair?
C: THOR
D: Some creepy old man cut it off.
C: BANNER
D: It looks good.
C: THOR
D: Thanks.
C: BANNER
D: Where are we? How's Nat?
C: THOR
D: Nat is good, I'm sure.
C: BANNER
D: And what about Sokovia?
C: THOR
D: Sokovia?
C: BANNER
D: The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
C: THOR
D: Banner, listen.
C: BANNER
D: What?
C: THOR
D: Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 75.
C: BANNER
D: What are you saying? I've been Hulk for two years?
C: THOR
D: I'm afraid so.
N: Banner's eyes BULGE. Trying to process this information.
C: BANNER
D: What the hell happened?
N: Banner rushes to his feet. Thor follows.
C: THOR
D: Banner, there's something you should know...
N: Banner goes to the flight console.
C: QUINJET
D: Voice Activation required.
E: V.O.
C: BANNER
D: Banner.
C: QUINJET
D: Welccome, Strongest Avenger.
E: V.O.
C: THOR
D: What?
E: puzzled
C: BANNER
D: Ship's log...
N: THE SHIP'S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN. FROM BEHIND THE DISPLAY (within the monitor looking out) we see fragmented images of the Hulk's trip through deep space. We see the angry green giant thrash around in zero gravity. We see Hulk closer to the camera now, looking stressed and car sick. THROW FOCUS to see Banner's face watching the video, Hulk's freaked out face is super-imposed over Banner's freaked out face.
C: BANNER
D: Thor, where are we? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 76.
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: Yeah, about that.
N: Banner hears:
C: GRANDMASTER
D: It's bad news, bad news today.
E: O.S.
N: Banner rushes over to the windshield. Through it he sees- -Grandmaster, his hologram projection towering over the city.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Sakaar, hear ye. Attention please. I have some bad news. My beloved, exalted Champion has turned up missing. Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion.
E: CONT'D
C: BANNER
D: Who's that?
C: THOR
D: He kind of runs the place. You actually lived in his house.
N: Back to Banner. A distant, confused stare.
C: BANNER
D: I did?
C: THOR
D: Yeah. Quite a lot's happened. You and I had a fight recently.
C: BANNER
D: Did I win?
C: THOR
D: No, I won. Easily.
C: BANNER
D: Doesn't sound right.
C: THOR
D: Well, it's true.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 77.
C: THOR
D: Seductive GOD of Thunder. We need to move.
C: BANNER
D: Oh, no. This is bad. This is really, really bad. Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
C: THOR
D: No, no, no. Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on.
N: Thor tosses Banner some clothes. Banner looks at them.
C: BANNER
D: These are Tony's clothes.
C: THOR
D: I know, come on.
C: BANNER
D: Is he here?
C: THOR
D: No, he's not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay? The sun's going down. The sun's getting really low. Sun's going down.
S: INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - DAY
N: Loki and Valkyrie are brought before Grandmaster, who has at least tripled the amount of bodyguards around him.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: I'm upset! I'm very upset. You know what I like about being upset? Blame. Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in. And you know who I'm blaming?
C: LOKI
D: Grandmaster, I-
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Hey! Don't interrupt me!
N: Topaz hands the melt stick to the grandmaster.
C: TOPAZ
D: Here you go. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 78.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Why are you handing me the melt stick? He was interrupting. That's not a capital violation. My precious champion has come up missing and its all because of that Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him. YOUR brother. Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated. I'm sure there's a big history. And YOUR contender.
E: refocuses to Loki to Valkyrie
C: LOKI
D: My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you.
C: VALKYRIE
D: I can do it in two.
C: LOKI
D: I could do it in one.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: You know what? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution. But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little "who's gonna get him first?" So you're on the clock.
S: INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY
N: Valkyrie exits in a hurry. Loki follows her.
C: LOKI
D: What have you done!?
N: Val reverses position, putting Loki up against the wall.
C: VALKYRIE
D: I don't answer to you, lackey.
C: LOKI
D: It's Loki. And you will answer to the Grandmaster. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 79.
N: Loki moves to reverse position again, but Val BREAKS AWAY, drawing her TWO BLADES. In response, Loki UNSHEATHES two long Sakaarian daggers. They eye each other, and then- -FIGHT! A fast-paced and deadly battle of knives. After a few exchanges, Val connects a BIG SHOT that SLAMS Loki into the wall. He scowls.
C: LOKI
D: Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?
E: CONT'D
C: VALKYRIE
D: I don't help anyone.
N: Loki trails off. He sees her wrist markings. A realization.
C: LOKI
D: You're a Valkyrie. I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?
N: Now Val ATTACKS Loki! She gets him up against the wall, her blade against his throat. She looks ready to kill him.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Choose your next words wisely.
C: LOKI
D: Terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory...
N: Quick as a rattlesnake, Loki GRABS Val's head and CASTS an illusion. Val's eyes CLOUD OVER with darkness as we go to:
S: EXT. HELA'S DIMENSION - FLASHBACK
N: A barren black void of death. The VALKYRIE, in old school Asgardian armor, charge through the DIMENSIONAL RIFT, an open portal to Asgard and the Nine Realms. Val witnesses these events as moments frozen in time. - Reveal Hela in all her glory, black lightning everywhere. - Dozens of Valkyrie falling through the dark space. - The Valkyrie's winged horses lay dead on the battlefield. - Through the open portal we can see the throne of Asgard. - Hela advancing on the final few Valkyrie - one is Val, frozen in fear, shell-shocked. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 80. - Hela FIRING black weapons at Val... - One of Val's sisters DIVING IN at the last second, SHOVING VAL back through the PORTAL and taking the fatal hit! - Val lands hard in the Throne room. - Val scrambling to her feet and trying to re-enter the rift but it's too late. It closes, the last image she sees is Hela dealing the final killer blow to her doomed Valkyrie sisters.
S: EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS
N: We find Val on her knees in front of Loki, trembling from this visceral memory that she's tried so hard to suppress. She turns on Loki, raging, and knocks him out.
S: EXT. SAKAAR - STOOP - DAY
N: BANNER sits, groaning, head in his hands. THOR is beside him, rubbing his back and on the lookout for threats.
C: THOR
D: The sun's going down. It's getting really low. The sun's going down. It's getting real low.
C: BANNER
D: Would you stop saying that!?
C: THOR
D: I just need you to stay calm.
C: BANNER
D: Calm!? I'm on an alien planet!
C: THOR
D: It's just a planet. You've been on a planet before.
C: BANNER
D: Yeah! One!
C: THOR
D: Now you've been on two. That's a good thing. It's a new experience.
C: BANNER
D: My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 81.
E: MORE
C: BANNER
D: The whole thing is totally different this time. In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel, but this time it's like he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk.
E: CONT'D beat
C: THOR
D: Alright, well, you're back now, that's all that matters.
C: BANNER
D: No, it's not what matters. What I'm trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may never come back. And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.
C: THOR
D: We're not stranded, I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.
C: BANNER
D: Thank you.
C: THOR
D: Not your home, though. Asgard.
C: BANNER
D: What?
C: THOR
D: Listen, my people are in great danger. You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister.
C: BANNER
D: Okay, that is so wrong on so many... I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.
C: THOR
D: No, she's an evil being.
C: BANNER
D: I don't care what she is. I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it. I just told you. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 82.
E: MORE
C: BANNER
D: If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again. And you don't care.
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: No, no. I'm putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire.
C: BANNER
D: Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.
C: THOR
D: What? No!
C: BANNER
D: It's gross. You don't care about me. You're not my friend.
C: THOR
D: No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like... "smash, smash, smash." I prefer you.
C: BANNER
D: Thanks.
C: THOR
D: But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful.
C: BANNER
D: Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
C: THOR
D: Is he though?
C: BANNER
D: How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero. How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.
C: THOR
D: Fine, you don't have to fight anyone. But we're in danger here, so we have to move.
N: Thor grabs a towel from the ground next to him. He puts the towel over his head.
C: BANNER
D: What are you doing with that? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 83.
C: THOR
D: I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
C: BANNER
D: I need a disguise.
C: THOR
D: You are the disguise.
N: Banner finds a pair of Stark's sunglasses in his jacket.
C: BANNER
D: I'll be Tony Stark.
C: THOR
D: What?
C: BANNER
D: Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
C: THOR
D: No, no you're not Tony. You're Bruce Banner.
C: BANNER
D: Then why did you dress me up like Tony?
C: THOR
D: Because you were naked.
C: BANNER
D: Okay, I'll give you that.
N: They stand up. Banner adjusts his crotch.
C: THOR
D: What are you doing? Stop doing that!
C: BANNER
D: Tony wears his pants super tight!
C: THOR
D: Why are you being so weird?
C: BANNER
D: I don't know. Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years inside of a monster made me a little weird.
N: Banner flashes green. Thor calms him down. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 84.
C: THOR
D: Hey. It's okay. You're good. Calm down. Come on. Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right?
C: BANNER
D: All right.
N: WHAP! Banner gets nailed in the face with green paint. Caught off guard, Thor and Banner are swept off into-
S: 69A EXT. PARADE OF VICTORS - CONTINUOUS 69A
N: It's a massive street festival where revelers dance and cheer while throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebration of Hulk! Green EVERYWHERE! Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner as he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward. Thor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and pulls him into another alley, but sees- -Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley!
C: THOR
D: This is bad. Banner! Banner!
N: Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to see that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of a SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright. Thor sees Banner across the crowd. Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively, awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders. One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a MASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner. WHAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper with a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS. Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.

D: What's with the...
C: THOR
D: It's my disguise.
C: VALKYRIE
D: But I can see your face.
C: THOR
D: Not when I do this, you can't. Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
E: covers his face then:
N: Valkyrie just rolls her eyes, takes Thor by the arm.
C: BANNER
D: What are those things on her eyes? Are those the people that she's killed? She's so beautiful and strong...

S: A73 INT. SAKAARIAN BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS A73
N: Continue down the hallway.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Look, I've spent years in a haze trying to forget my past. Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day.
C: THOR
D: I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you.
C: VALKYRIE
D: I don't plan to stop drinking, but I don't want to forget. I can't turn away anymore. So, if I'm donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag.
C: THOR
D: Good.
N: They arrive at a door. Before they enter:
C: VALKYRIE
D: Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name?
C: THOR
D: Yeah, it's called the Revengers. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 87.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Revengers?

D: Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge. Do you want revenge?
E: to Banner:

D: I'm undecided.
C: THOR
D: Okay.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Also, I've got a peace offering.
S: INT. VALKYRIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Valkyrie opens the front door, revealing- -Loki! He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting in the middle of the apartment with a dozen chains around him.
C: LOKIE
D: Surprise.
N: Thor TOSSES a bottle. It BOUNCES off of Loki's head.
C: LOKI
D: OW!
C: THOR
D: Just had to be sure.
C: LOKI
D: Hello, Bruce.
C: BANNER
D: So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody. Where are you at these days?
C: LOKI
D: It varies from moment to moment.
N: Val's apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood- spattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc. Banner gives Thor a look like "she might be crazy." Thor responds with a "No, she's cool" gesture. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 88. Val lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OLD ASGARDIAN SWORD. Thor's eyes go wide as she sharpens it.
C: THOR
D: Is that... a Dragonfang?
C: VALKYRIE
D: It is.
C: THOR
D: My God. This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits.
N: A nice clean wormhole outside the city.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months.
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: Nope. We're going through that one.
N: Thor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean.
C: VALKYRIE
D: The Devil's Anus?
C: BANNER
D: Wait, whose anus are we going through?
C: THOR
D: For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.
C: BANNER
D: That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge.
C: VALKYRIE
D: We need another ship. That would tear mine to pieces.
C: THOR
D: She's right. We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 89.
N: Banner gives Thor a quizzical look.
C: BANNER
D: And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer.
C: VALKYRIE
D: And we need one with cup holders, because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
C: BANNER
D: Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
C: VALKYRIE
D: I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
C: THOR
D: What do you say, doctor? Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about an adventure.
E: to Banner:
N: Thor and Banner high five as Val stares at them blankly.
C: BANNER THOR
D: We need a ship. Need a ship.
E: CONT'D
C: VALKYRIE
D: There are one or two ships, absolute top-of-the-line models--
C: LOKI
D: I don't mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system.
N: All eyes turn to Loki. Valkyrie throws her bottle at him. It smashes above his head.
C: VALKYRIE
D: And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.
C: LOKI
D: Heavens, no. I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 90.
E: MORE
C: LOKI

E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: You're telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms?
C: LOKI
D: Yes, brother. I can.
C: BANNER
D: Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us.
C: VALKYRIE
D: He did try to kill me.
C: THOR
D: Yes, me too. On many, many occasions. There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes. So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!" And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.
N: Loki suppresses a smile.
C: VALKYRIE
D: If we're boosting a ship, we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.
C: LOKI
D: Why not set the beast loose?
C: THOR
D: Shut up.
C: VALKYRIE
D: You guys have a beast?
C: THOR
D: No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid. We're going to start a revolution. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 91.

N: Korg sits with his cell mates. He's talking to Miek.
C: KORG
D: Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that's coming out of you? Or are they eggs? Looks like eggs.
N: Suddenly his Obedience Disk POWERS DOWN. No longer glowing. As Korg stands up, Valkyrie appears at the door to his cell.
C: VALKYRIE
D: I'm looking for Korg.
C: KORG
D: Who's asking? I know you're asking. Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?
N: Valkyrie tosses him a high-tech rifle.

N: Grandmaster speaks with Topaz who now wears battle armor.

D: Revolution? How did this happen? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 92.
C: TOPAZ
D: Don't know. But the Arena's mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Oh! I don't like that word!
C: TOPAZ
D: Mainframe?
C: GRANDMASTER
D: No. Why would I not like "mainframe?" No, the "S" word.
C: TOPAZ
D: Sorry, the "prisoners with jobs" have armed themselves.
C: GRANDMASTER
D: Okay, that's better.
N: CHA-CHNK! SOUNDS OF MACHINERY as the whole space starts moving. A different angle reveals that we are in-
S: A77 EXT. THE STATESMAN - CONTINUOUS A77
N: Grandmaster's chambers are actually the oversized cockpit of a A HUGE RIOT CONTROL SHIP (The Statesman) that can dock itself indefinitely within the palace! The Statesman has DISLODGED from the palace and is now flanked by six smaller Sakaarian peace-keeping ships, all headed towards the city where RIOTING can be heard.

N: Thor waits as Loki enters codes to a door's security panel.
C: THOR

C: THOR
D: You have no idea. I've had quite the revelation since we spoke last.
N: The door opens, revealing a bunch of guards. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 93. Thor and Loki heft up two Sakaarian guns.
C: THOR
D: Hello!
E: CONT'D
C: LOKI
D: Hi!
N: Thor and Loki BLAST all the guards, moving to another door.
C: LOKI
D: Odin brought us together, it's almost poetic that his death should split us apart. We might as well be strangers now. "Two sons of the crown" set adrift.
E: CONT'D
N: A guard tries to ambush Loki through the door. Thor TAKES OUT the guard.
C: THOR
D: Thought you didn't want to talk about it?
S: INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor and Loki are going up.
C: LOKI
D: Here's the thing. I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.
C: THOR
D: That's exactly what I was thinking.
C: LOKI
D: ...Did you just agree with me?
C: THOR
D: This place is perfect for you. It's savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you're going to do GREAT here.
C: LOKI
D: Do you truly think so little of me?
N: Thor pauses, considers his brother. Then:
C: THOR
D: Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But, at the end of the day, you're you, I'm me... BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 94.
E: MORE
C: THOR
D: I don't know, maybe there's still good in you, but let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.
E: CONT'D
N: Loki is wounded by Thor's willingness to discard him. Masks his feelings with:
C: LOKI
D: It's probably for the best that we never see one another again.
N: Beat. Thor pats Loki affectionately on the shoulder. Hold on Loki. Did Thor just get through to him?
C: THOR
D: That's what you always wanted.
N: Beat. Then:
C: THOR
D: Hey, let's do "Get Help."
E: CONT'D
C: LOKI
D: What?
C: THOR
D: "Get Help."
C: LOKI
D: No.
C: THOR
D: Come on, you love it.
C: LOKI
D: I hate it.
C: THOR
D: It's great. IT works every time.
C: LOKI
D: It's humiliating.
C: THOR
D: Do you have a better plan?
C: LOKI
D: No.

S: INT. GRANDMASTER'S PRIVATE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Multi-tiered platforms with dozens of cool spaceships. The elevator doors open. Thor supports Loki's weight with Loki faking a fatal injury.
C: THOR

N: A small group of Sakaarian guards turn toward Thor and Loki. One guard aims his gun at them.
C: THOR
D: Get help! Help him!
E: CONT'D
N: Thor picked up Loki and flings him at the guards, knocking them down like bowling pins. Loki stands up and Thor steps to Loki's side.
C: THOR
D: Classic.
E: CONT'D
C: LOKI
D: I still hate it. It's humiliating.
C: THOR
D: Not for me, it's not.
C: THOR
D: Which one's the ship she told us to get?
E: CONT'D
C: LOKI
D: The Commodore.
E: points
N: The COMMODORE starship. Brand new, solidly built, sleek. As they walk towards it a DUPLICATE LOKI FORMS and LAGS BEHIND. The Loki walking with Thor is an illusion.
C: LOKI
D: Though I feel it won't make much of a difference... BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 96.
E: CONT'D
N: We follow the real Loki as he slinks away towards the security system panel. He activates the panel and brings up a screen that will set off all the alarms palace-wide!
C: THOR
D: Oh, Loki.
E: O.S.
N: Loki turns to see Thor looking not at all surprised.
C: LOKI
D: I know I've betrayed you many times before, but this time it's truly nothing personal. The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.
N: He triggers the alarm.
S: 82B INT. GRANDMASTER'S PRIVATE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 82B
C: THOR
D: Never one for sentiment, were you?
C: LOKI
D: Easier to let it burn.
N: But then Loki sees Thor holding up a fob device. Loki realizes that Thor affixed an Obedience Disk on him in that heart-to-heart moment.
C: THOR
D: I agree.
N: BZZZT! Thor ZAPS Loki and HOLDS DOWN the button. Loki HITS the ground, WRITHING in pain. Thor approaches. Pause.
C: THOR
D: Oh brother, you're becoming predictable. I trust you, you betray me. Round and round in circles we go.
E: CONT'D
N: Thor continues to "think about it" for a beat while Loki convulses in agony on the floor. Finally, Thor kneels down:
C: THOR
D: See, Loki, life is about, it's about growth. It's about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll always be the God of Mischief, but you could be more. I'll just put this over here for you. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 97.
E: CONT'D
N: Thor places the fob on top of the security panel, so close but so far from Loki's paralyzed reach.
C: THOR
D: Anyway, I got places to be so good luck.
E: CONT'D
S: 82C INT. COMMODORE SHIP - MOMENTS LATER 82C
N: Thor is seen in the cockpit.

N: Val MAXES OUT the throttle. The ship ACCELERATES. When she's under Thor's ship, Val presses- -THE EJECT BUTTON! Banner is LAUNCHED OUT OF THE SHIP!
S: INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor at the controls. We hear an incoming scream of increasing volume. "aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!" THUNK! Banner is SHOT UP into the ship. ROUGH LANDING. Banner casually lifts his arm up and gives a THUMBS UP. CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! The ship is being fired upon by another pursuit vehicle. Banner joins Thor.

E: V.O.
N: THOR / BANNER WHAT?!
C: VALKYRIE
D: Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.

C: BANNER
D: Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?
C: THOR
D: Yeah. Don't touch anything.
N: CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! More fire from behind.
S: A89 INT. WARSONG SHIP - THE SAME A89
N: Val's ship is hit. She rotates the cockpit to face BACKWARDS and opens fire, taking out the attacking chase-ship. But now in Val's cockpit... Sparks. Smoke. Alarms. In the distance Val clocks the Grandmaster's Riot Ship raining terror down on the masses. A look of determination as she pops the HATCH above - her ship is now a convertible.
S: EXT. SAKAAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Meanwhile, Warsong ZOOMS out from under Thor's ship, still ACCELERATING. Val has turned her ship into a missile, and its trajectory is the Grandmaster's Riot Control Ship! Grandmaster is still taunting his former captives below when- -KA-BOOM! Warsong SLAMS into the Statesman, specifically the Grandmaster's projection!

D: None of them are for flying alien spaceships!
S: EXT. THE SAKAARIAN OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
N: Thor LEAPS into the middle of this high-speed dogfight! These two superhuman Asgardians begin jumping between their pursuer's ships, taking out guns, engines, and pilots with their bare hands. It's spectacular and epic. Thor RIPS out an engine block and uses it to crush a pilot. Val DRAGS her blades down the entire underbelly of a ship before BACKFLIPPING to another. Back and forth they go, even passing each other mid-flight a few times. One by one the Sakaarian ships GO DOWN.
S: A97 INT. COMMODORE SHIP - SAME A97
N: Banner is frantically STEERING the ship, doing his best to dodge all the incoming fire. He peels away and is followed by Topaz, who is in her own chase-ship. Banner notices a button with a little explosion icon.
C: BANNER
D: Okay, come on. There's gotta be a gun on this thing. That looks like a gun.
N: Banner PRESSES the button. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 102. The ship's lighting changes, like a disco effect. Weird dance music BLASTS over the PA, followed by Grandmaster's voice.
C: GRANDMASTER

E: V.O.
N: Banner is so confused. Then we hear FIREWORKS.
S: B97 EXT. THE SAKAARIAN OCEAN - CONTINUOUS B97
N: MASSIVE PLUMES of powder paint SHOOT OUT of the ship followed by a huge colorful fireworks display. And then a rainforest's worth of confetti is dumped from the hull! Topaz is suddenly in the middle of a party smoke screen! She tries to fly her way through all the fireworks and streamers, but ultimately she hits a HARD CRASH LANDING in the ocean.
C: BANNER
D: Yeah!
N: Meanwhile, Thor and Val land together on the one remaining Sakaarian ship. Val leaks a smile to Thor. Thor YANKS OFF the cockpit cover, Val TOSSES the pilot, and together they PUSH FORWARD on the throttle. The ship SPEEDS FORWARD.

N: The OBEDIENCE DISK FOB on the ground. He picks it up. Korg then notices LOKI, TWITCHING and CONVULSING on the ground. He's barely made any progress towards the fob. Loki locks eyes with Korg, a desperate and furious plea. Korg looks at Loki, then at the fob, then back to Loki. Loki gives Korg a maniacal, pleading look. Korg gets it. He deactivates the obedience disk. Loki stands, dusts himself off.
C: LOKI
D: Thank you.

Under strain. The commodore heads toward the end of the wormhole. Debris flies past the camera. Thor, Val, and Banner all look like they are in extreme pain, as there's great concern the ship could be torn apart. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 104.

D: I'll take it from here.
N: Thor produces a bundle of FABRIC WITH GOLD AND WHITE PLATING.
C: THOR
D: I found this in the armory.
N: Val immediately recognizes its significance. She doesn't want to be affected by this gesture, but can't help it. They share a look as the Commodore lifts off into the air. Before she's out of earshot, Val calls down:
C: VALKYRIE
D: "Your majesty." Don't die. You know what I mean.
N: The Commodore flies away, leaving Thor on the balcony.
S: 109A INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 109A
N: Thor's footsteps ECHO through the empty space. He sees the items from the vault scattered beside the throne. Thor sees a chunk of plaster from the dismantled fresco. He picks it up and sees that this piece of fresco bears a portion of his own face. Thor then looks up, off camera. His eyes go wide. He looks up at the ceiling where his painting used to be and finds the original which depicts Odin and Hela conquering the nine realms, with Hela's butchers all around them. Hela holds Mjolnir. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 107.
S: EXT. ASGARD - MOUNTAIN RAVINE - DAY
N: Hela, cowl & headdress on, stands with Skurge outside of the mountain stronghold where Heimdall is hiding the refugees. Hela raises her arms and FIRES LONG THIN BLACK LANCES, which BURROW into crevices on the mountainside. From here, we TILT UP, looking straight at the sky. With the lances in place, Hela bears down. Summoning all her focus and energy, she begins to VIBRATE this manifestation of her powers, PUNCTURING crevices and splitting rock apart. The whole mountain begins to RUMBLE.
S: EXT. ASGARD - MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD - SAME
N: CRACK! Hela RIPS OPEN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN! There is an avalanche of rock and debris. The mountain around the doors completely destroyed, the doors fall across the ravine, creating a bridge for Hela and Skurge. Hela waits patiently for the dust to settle and sees- -an empty stronghold. No sign of Heimdall or the refugees.
S: EXT. SECRET MOUNTAIN PATH - SAME

S: EXT. MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD - DUSK
N: Hela is about to throttle Skurge when- -A LOUD GONG SOUND. It's coming from far away, but the deep note resonates across the land. GONG-GONG-GONG-GONG! Hela looks to the Palace, her eyes narrowing with rage.
S: INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Find Thor on the throne holding GUNGNIR - THE KING'S SPEAR, Odin's signature spear. SLAMMING the butt of it on the ground. GONG...GONG... Hela steps into the throne room. Headdress & cowl off. Thor stops the GONGING when he sees Hela.

C: HELA
D: You're still alive.

D: I love what you've done with the place. Redecorating, I see.
C: HELA
D: It seems our father's solution to every problem was to cover it up.
C: THOR
D: Or to cast it out. He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.
E: then:
N: Angle on Hela in the frescos, fighting with Mjolnir.
C: HELA
D: You see, you never knew him, not at his best. Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears. Where do you think all this gold came from? And then one day he decided to become a benevolent king. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 109.
E: nostalgic sigh MORE
C: HELA
D: To foster peace, to protect life. To have you.
E: CONT'D with teeth

C: HEIMDALL
D: Go back!
N: The refugees turn to retreat. Fenris CHARGES! GUNFIRE FROM ABOVE! The Commodore swoops onto the scene, Valkyrie manning the blaster and FIRING on Fenris, who stops his charge. As the refugees retreat, they come to a stop because... ...SKURGE IS LEADING AN ARMY OF BUTCHERS BEHIND THEM! Heimdall and the refugees are now trapped on the bridge between Fenris and Skurge!

D: Now you remind me of Dad.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME
N: Asgardians CLASH with Hela's Butchers. Valkyrie keeps raining down fire on Fenris, but it is doing no real damage. Just pissing the wolf off. Fenris shakes off the bullets and resumes CHARGING. Heimdall sees Fenris charging and steps out in front of the refugees with his sword, preparing for the worst.
S: INT. COMMODORE SHIP - SAME
N: Valkyrie gives up shooting.

C: BANNER
D: You'll see.
N: Banner LEAPS out of the ship! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 112.
S: EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Banner soars through the air. It's an awe-inspiring image as we follow Banner's trajectory downwards. His face is determined, arms churning, ready to Hulk out... ...except it doesn't happen. Worry washes over his face. SPLAT! Banner FACEPLANTS on the bridge, seeming to break every bone in his body. He looks dead. Pause. Fenris SNIFFS him curiously. We notice one vein on Banner's neck PUMPING GREEN. Then- -Banner suddenly EXPLODES UP as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, UPPER- CUTTING Fenris in the jaw! Hulk is now in a wrestling match with a beast four times his size - the two of them go TUMBLING into the water below.
S: EXT. PALACE BALCONY - SAME

E: then:
N: Thor looks down. Distraught. Heartsick.
S: EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Val pilots the Commodore towards the battle on the city side of the bridge. Skurge's battlion of Butchers surge forward- -BOOM! Val LANDS the Commodore on top of them, SKIDDING across the bridge, CRUSHING the front line of the Butchers, and KNOCKING Skurge aside. The impact triggers the party function, setting off PARTY MUSIC and a FIREWORKS DISPLAY. Val emerges from the ship in full battle mode. Behind her, the Commodore FIREWORKS provide a spectacular HERO BACKDROP. She draws DRAGONFANG and smiles as Butchers begin swarming towards her. She is where she needs to be. Meanwhile, the Asgardians huddle together, packed so tight that some begin to fall off the side of the bridge, loved ones grabbing them and pulling them back up. There's no hope. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 113. Heimdall FIGHTS off Butchers, but gets KNOCKED DOWN. Just as it looks like he's about to take a killing blow- -BAM! The Butcher is BLASTED. Korg steps into frame, holding the blaster!

N: Miek steps into frame, waving.
C: KORG
D: We're going to jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Want to come?
E: CONT'D
N: Heimdall is beyond confused, but then... a LOUD NOISE. Hela looks down to see- -EMERGING FROM THE THICK LOW-HANGING FOG IS LOKI! Resplendent in horns, arms spread wide, seeming to float towards the bridge like a mythical angel of mercy.
C: LOKI
D: Your savior is here!
N: The fog dissipates around him, revealing that Loki's standing on THE GRANDMASTER'S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that will become clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK. And Loki is not alone. He's brought along all the prisoners from the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons. The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge. ABOVE: Even with Hela's hand on his throat, Thor can't help but smile at the sight of Loki. Hela however sneers.
C: HELA
D: That little shit.
N: BELOW: Loki and the Sakaarian gladiators JUMP OFF the Ark and onto the bridge, joining the fight against Hela's forces.
C: LOKI
D: Did you miss me? Everybody on that ship, now.
N: The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The only way onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is an immediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened people all pushing for a chance at salvation. It's mayhem. Loki walks through the crowd to Heimdall. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 114.
C: HEIMDALL

C: HELA
D: Tell me brother, what were you the God of again...?
N: CLOSE ON Thor's clenched fist, small arcs of electricity forming. -THE LOUDEST CRACK OF THUNDER YOU'VE EVER HEARD! In an instant, Thor and Hela are ENGULFED in a bolt of lightning!! KA-BOOM! Hela is BLASTED OUT of the lightning and sent CRASHING into the streets of Asgard. Her costume is tattered, the black extensions of her power hanging off her body in some places. She appears to be unconscious! All around Asgard, EVERYONE looks up at this massive strike.
S: EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE (OBSERVATORY SIDE) - CONTINUOUS
N: BOOM! Thor LANDS HARD on his feet. Muscles swollen, veins pulsing with electricity. A living storm. Thor DIVES INTO THE FRAY. He moves like a bolt of lightning, SURGING through the army of Butchers in quick SLASHING JOLTS.

At the middle of the bridge, Heimdall helps load the fleeing Asgardians onto the Ark. Within the melee are Loki, Korg and the Sakaarians. Loki SLASHES through Butchers wielding his two long daggers. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 117. In the water below, Hulk and Fenris WRESTLE in an colossal clash of FISTS, CLAWS, and TEETH. Beyond that, Thor is wielding electrified weapons and BLASTING entire packs of Butchers off the bridge! Lost in the chaos is Skurge, who sees the tides turning. He throws down his axe and blends into the crowd.
S: EXT. ASGARD - WATER BELOW - CONTINUOUS
N: Fenris has Hulk in his mouth, underwater. Trying to drown the green goliath! Fenris' teeth PUNCTURE Hulk's skin. He BELLOWS, THRASHING. Hulk winds up and SLAMS Fenris in the snout!

C: THOR
D: You're late.
C: LOKI
D: You're missing an eye.
N: Valkyrie finishes off a handful of enemies, but then notices something. She WHISTLES to get the others' attention.

D: This isn't over.
N: All around the bridge, our heroes look to see- -Hela arriving at the far side of bridge. She is seething with power, a vision of death. Having just come out of this huge battle, they are all weary and nursing injuries. Loki and Val are hurting worse than Thor. Hela walks towards them. Menacing and deliberate. Thor, Loki, and Val step forward to protect the Asgardians. They huddle together.
C: THOR
D: I think we should disband the Revengers.
C: LOKI
D: Hit her with a lightning blast.
C: THOR
D: I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning. It did nothing.

D: We need to hold her off until everybody's on board. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 119.
N: Thor looks at the people boarding behind him.

C: VALKYRIE
D: What's our move?
C: LOKI
D: I'm not doing "Get help."
N: Thor sees Hela approaching. He sees the palace behind her. He comes to a realization.
C: THOR
D: Asgard's not a place, it's a people. This was never about stopping Ragnarok...it was about causing Ragnarok. Go to the vault. Surtur's crown. It's the only way.
E: then to Loki:
C: LOKI
D: Bold move, brother. Even for me.
E: impressed
N: Loki runs off, leaving Thor and Val to deal with Hela.
C: THOR
D: Shall we?
C: VALKYRIE
D: After you.
N: Thor ATTACKS. They CLASH, kicking off this monumental confrontation. Hela manifests pitch black weapons to attack Thor, but Thor is conjuring powerful bolts of electricity with the same speed and ferocity. Just as Thor is surging with newfound lightning powers, Hela's powers seem to be enhanced as well. The battle is relentless and fast-paced. Thor is holding his own against Hela. Maybe they can win this thing. After several fearsome exchanges, Hela PUNCTURES his shoulder and then DARTS past him with startling speed. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 120. Undeterred, Thor RUSHES Hela again.

N: Thor continues FIGHTING Hela while Valkyrie BLOCKS Hela's attempts to spear the Asgardians from afar. Hela isn't landing any fatal blows, but she's carving Thor up and making steady progress towards the Ark. However, the Asgardian refugees finally make it aboard. An injured Heimdall, Korg, and Miek are the last to get on. Thor and Heimdall make eye contact. Thor calls out:
C: THOR
D: GO! GO NOW!
N: As the Ark's engines begin to POWER UP- -Hela HARPOONS Thor. He goes down, grimacing in pain. Hela begins to CONJURE AN ENORMOUS MANIFESTATION OF HER POWERS, A GIANT BLACK SPIKE FROM THE BEDROCK OF ASGARD THAT STABS THE ARK AND PREVENTS IT FROM LEAVING!

C: SKURGE
D: For Asgard.
N: Skurge runs forward, LEAPS off the Ark, and LANDS on the bridge right where all the Butchers are coming to life. BLASTING AWAY the Butchers before they can get aboard. Behind Skurge, the Ark begins to LIFT OFF. Skurge keeps FIRING and then-

D: HELA!

S: EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Hela has Val in her clutches, but her focus is on the aftermath of Skurge's last stand and the Ark's subsequent escape. She's furious, about to unleash hell when-

N: KA-BOOM! EXPLODING through the roof of the palace is SURTUR! This is a different Surtur than the opening. He is slowly but steadily GROWING in size, and he carries with him a massive flaming sword, which GROWS as well. Surtur's arrival literally SHAKES the bedrock of Asgard, causing FISSURES to spiderweb all around him, and DISLODGING some of the foundation on the bridge and around the palace. Hela's eyes go wide.

Mustering up all her remaining strength, Val DRIVES Dragonfang through Hela's chest, effectively PINNING her to the bridge. Refocused on Val, Hela goes to deliver a death blow when- -Thor BOLTS forward! He PULLS Val from Hela's clutches. Thor turns and FIRES LIGHTNING INTO DRAGONFANG, which DISLODGES the section of the bridge that Hela is pinned to! The ground beneath Hela BREAKS FREE and she goes FALLING down into the expanding fissure in Asgard's bedrock. Badly injured, Thor and Valkyrie look up to see- -Surtur INCREASING in size, now towering over the palace.

C: THOR
D: Hulk no! Stop it you moron!!
E: CONT'D
N: It's not doing much damage, but the shock of it plus Hulk's impact makes Surtur take a destructive step back. Hulk is trying to rip out one of Surtur's horns when Surtur reaches up and GRABS HIM with a giant fiery hand. Surtur HURLS Hulk away from him. Sends him CRASHING DOWN. Hulk stumbles to his feet, dazed and SMOKING. After gathering his bearings, Hulk gets REALLY ANGRY and heads back towards Surtur for round two, but-

C: HULK
D: Friends.
N: Hulk PICKS UP Thor and Valkyrie. He then squats down, and- -LEAPS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT! The trio SHOOTS UP into the night sky like a rocket blasting off. Their trajectory is heading right at the Ark as it reaches the lower orbit of Asgard.

S: INT. THE ARK - MAIN DECK
N: Thor steps out onto the main deck to see an assembly of both Asgardian and Sakaarian refugees awaiting their King. Thor looks over his people and begins to walk through the crowd. His subjects part, allowing him through. It is the antithesis of the opening coronation from the first THOR movie. The people aren't cheering and lauding him, but rather they are smiling. Humbly bowing. Grateful. And Thor isn't acting arrogant. Not trying to show off any swagger. He is stately. A contemplative and dignified king. At the end of the procession, Hulk, Loki, Valkyrie, and Heimdall stand next to the CAPTAIN'S CHAIR.
C: VALKYRIE
D: Your throne.
N: Pause. Reluctant acceptance. Thor sits down. Flanking him on opposite sides are Valkyrie and Heimdall. Behind/towering above them is the Hulk. Loki joins them.
C: HEIMDALL
D: So, King of Asgard.
N: Thor turns around to see THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE staring back, silently awaiting word from their new King. Now feeling the true weight of the crown, Thor takes a moment... and then:
C: HEIMDALL
D: Where to?
E: CONT'D
C: THOR
D: I'm not sure. Any suggestions? Miek, what's your home planet?
N: Angle on Korg, who is holding Miek (sans robot exoskeleton).
C: KORG
D: Oh, Miek's dead. I accidentally stepped on him on the bridge, I've just felt so guilty I've been carrying him around all day... BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16 128.
N: Miek WRIGGLES to life. Korg lights up.
C: KORG
D: Miek, you're alive! He's alive everyone! What was your question?
E: CONT'D
N: Thor looks forward, taking charge of this one.
C: THOR
D: Earth it is.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: THE END.
S: TAG INT. THE ARK - DAY TAG
N: THOR and LOKI look out the window.
C: LOKI
D: Do you really think it's a good idea to go back to Earth?
C: THOR
D: Sure! They love me there.
C: LOKI
D: Let me rephrase: Do you really think it's a good idea to bring me back to Earth?
N: Thor smiles, getting it. Pats Loki on the shoulder.
C: THOR
D: Probably not. But don't worry, brother...I've got a feeling that everything's going to work out.
N: Then through the window, they see- -THE MASSIVE FORM OF SANCTUARY-2, THANOS' WARSHIP approaching.
S: TAG1 EXT. THE ARK - SAME TAG1
N: A wider view allows us to see all of Sanctuary-2, dwarfing the Ark in size. END.
