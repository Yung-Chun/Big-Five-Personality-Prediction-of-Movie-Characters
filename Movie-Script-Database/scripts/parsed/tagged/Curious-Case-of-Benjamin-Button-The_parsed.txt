M: Written by

M: Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald
M: 10/30/07
N: As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind blowing, rattling a window.
C: A WOMAN'S
D: What are you looking at?
E: V.O.
C: CAROLINE
D: The wind, Mother... They say a hurricane is on its way... You've been asleep... I was waiting to see you...
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT
N: Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white enamel paint trying without success to hide the years... An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a Southern lilt.
C: DAISY
D: If it wasn't for hurricanes we wouldn't have a hurricane season.
C: CAROLINE
D: I've forgotten what the weather can be like here. I've lived with four seasons so many years now.
N: We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER, in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the window...
C: DOROTHY BAKER
D: I saw on the news they're predicting trouble...
C: DAISY
D: 1928 they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee.
N: But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...
C: DAISY
D: It all runs together... like a fingerpainting... I feel like I'm on a boat, drifting...
E: CONT'D
C: CAROLINE
D: Can I do anything for you, Mother? Make anything easier?
E: tenderly
C: DAISY
D: Hmmm. There is nothing to do, Caroline. This is what it is... I'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open... my mouth all filled with cotton...
N: And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.
C: DOROTHY BAKER
D: There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll scratch yourself to ribbons... It's their way of letting go... ...prob'ly today.
E: to Caroline the finality
N: Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her admonition of death being so close at hand, makes everything even more present...
C: CAROLINE
D: Do you want more medication, Mother? The doctor said you can have all you want.
N: Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline, seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter, comforting her.
C: CAROLINE
D: A friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother. I wanted to thank you, Mother, for bringing me into this world. For raising me so well.
E: CONT'D grateful to have the chance MORE
C: CAROLINE
D: I wanted to tell you how much you've meant to me. I'm going to miss you so much...
E: CONT'D
N: They hold each other for some time... They separate... And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal question...
C: CAROLINE
D: Are you afraid?
E: CONT'D
C: DAISY
D: Curious. What comes next...
N: She winces at some physical pain.
C: DOROTHY BAKER
D: The pain's coming more steadily... Her breathing will falter soon... No need for her to suffer..
N: She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes... drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a sound, crosses her mind... and she says...
C: DAISY
D: They built that train station in 1918. Your father was there the day it opened... He said a tuba band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...
S: EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918
N: And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new TRAIN STATION...
C: DAISY
D: Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The finest clockmaker in all of the South built that clock...
S: INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917
N: We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless array of clocks and watches...
C: DAISY'S
D: His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr. Cake.
E: V.O.
N: 3A.
S: INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT
N: The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to herself again... "Mr. Cake..."
S: INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT
N: We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small, delicate hands, "Mr. Cake," working in his downstairs workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...
C: DAISY'S
D: He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish and they had a son.
E: V.O.
N: Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.
C: DAISY'S
D: Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from birth, absolutely blind.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917
N: ...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...

D: And when their son came of age, like boys will do, he joined the army. They saw him off at the old train station.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917
N: An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his hat goodbye to his son...
C: DAISY'S
D: Oh how he worked, for months he did nothing but work on the clock for the great train station.
E: V.O.
S: INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918
N: The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at work...
C: DAISY'S
D: One day a letter came...
E: V.O.
N: Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her hand... She reads to her blind husband...
C: BLANCHE DEVEREUX
D: "I am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country, at the battle of the Marne. In the death of Sgt. Martin Gateau I lose one of my most trusted men.
E: MORE
C: BLANCHE DEVEREUX
D: When I informed members of our company he had fallen, on every face could be seen the mark of sorrow... ...we were in hope the Lord would spare him to return home together... Alas this was not to be. I send along his pants, shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and haircomb."
E: CONT'D
C: DAISY
D: Mr. Gateau, done for the night, went up to his bed.
E: V.O.
N: Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs...
C: DAISY'S
D: And their son came home.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918
N: We see "Mr. Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.
C: DAISY'S
D: They buried him where the Gateau family had been buried for a hundred and seven years...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1918

S: INT. THE CLOCK WORKSHOP, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1918
N: Mr. Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up the clock back... finished at last.
C: DAISY'S
D: It was a morning to remember... Papa said there were people everywhere...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918
N: And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling of the clock. Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets alike...
C: DAISY'S
D: Even Teddy Roosevelt had come.
E: V.O.
N: And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt, in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders. We watch Mr. Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape... He stands for a moment... and with a simple tug, releases the purple swath... People gasp at the magnificent clock... "Mr. Cake" winds the clock, which chimes a glorious chime... Pushed by an angel, the second-hand begins its eternal journey...going around... Everyone cheers... until they realize the clock is going the wrong way... traveling backwards in time... A man shouts, "It's running backwards!"
C: MONSIEUR GATEAU
D: I made it this way... so that perhaps, the boys who were lost in the war might stand and go home again...
S: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY, 1918
N: And we see just that... bullets leaving mens' wounds sailing back into the rifles from whence they came... limbs, whole again... cannon balls rocketing backwards into the cannons' breech... Fallen come to their feet, to live and breathe again.
C: MONSIEUR GATEAU
D: ... home to farm, to work, have children, to live long, full lives...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918
N: Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat...
C: MONSIEUR GATEAU
D: Perhaps, my own son might come home again...
S: EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, ANOTHER TIME
N: And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life hopping backward off the train to land where his journey started... back in the arms of his loving parents...
S: INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918
C: MONSIEUR GATEAU
D: I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I hope you enjoy my clock.
N: And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the terminal and exits... The crowd is motionless. They look to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance... but he simply puts his hat on, and with his guardians, is gone...
C: DAISY'S
D: Mr Cake was never seen again. Some say he died of a broken heart. Some say he went to sea...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - AT THE END OF A DAY
N: Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing... away...
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT
C: DAISY
D: He just rowed...rowed...away...
N: The wind loudly rattles the window...they turn to look...
C: DOROTHY BAKER
D: Do you mind if I make myself a call? I've got somebody watching my little boy.
C: CAROLINE
D: No, please go call...
N: It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying mother... with the wind knocking at the window... After some moments:
C: CAROLINE
D: I hope I haven't disappointed you, Mother.
E: CONT'D
C: DAISY
D: Oh honey, you could never disappoint me.
C: CAROLINE
D: I wished I had more to show for myself. I know you would have liked to have had grandchildren.
E: MORE
C: CAROLINE
D: My life hasn't been all that... normal...
E: CONT'D
N: As if to say the pieces haven't all fit... trying to articulate it...
C: CAROLINE
D: I'm either a step ahead... or a step behind...
E: CONT'D
C: DAISY
D: What's normal? A hat full of sand.
C: CAROLINE
D: What?
C: DAISY
D: I need my brown suitcase... The envelope...
E: going on
C: CAROLINE
D: An envelope?
N: Caroline doing what she's asked goes over to one of the suitcases by the bed... She opens it... and among the clothes and the keepsakes, there is indeed an old envelope.
C: CAROLINE
D: This one?
E: CONT'D
C: DAISY
D: I tried to read it a hundred different times... but I couldn't bring myself...
C: CAROLINE
D: What do you mean?
C: DAISY
D: Read it to me.
N: Daisy closes her eyes... Caroline takes out a sheath of papers... It's a journal of some kind written in longhand... Pages have come undone... scraps of paper, even some napkins...
C: DAISY
D: Just the sound of your voice...
E: CONT'D murmurs
N: And for her mother's sake she begins to read it... with no particular interest, like reading to someone a selection from a menu's choices...
C: CAROLINE
D: It's dated "April 4, 1985." It says, "New Orleans." "This is my last will and testament... I don't have much to leave... few possessions, no money really... I will go out of this world the same way I came in, alone and with nothing. All I have is my story... I'm writing it now while I still remember it..."
E: after a beat which starts to engage her finding herself engaged
N: She's interested. She looks over at her mother. But her mother's eyes are closed...
C: CAROLINE
D: "My name is Benjamin..."
E: CONT'D
N: And Caroline's voice becomes a young MAN'S voice...
C: A MAN'S
D: "Benjamin Button... and I was born under unusual circumstances."
E: V.O.
S: EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918
N: THERE'S SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS.
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: The war to end all wars had ended.
E: V.O.
N: We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with drunken, singing revelers... cars jamming the cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful... Another burst of fireworks.
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: I was told it was an especially good night to be born...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: 9A. And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a fashionable town home. He nearly collides with a PRIEST who arrives there at the same time. Thomas runs past him, up the steps...
S: INT. BUTTON HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918
N: ...He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase... barging into the MASTER BEDROOM...
S: INT. MASTER BEDROOM, BUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 1918
N: ... where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed, frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the help of the small domestic staff... the PRIEST enters...
C: THOMAS BUTTON
D: Why are you here?
E: seeing him
C: THE DOCTOR
D: Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going to survive...
N: And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets, futilely start to change her bloody linens...
C: THOMAS BUTTON
D: That's enough...! All of you!
N: They move out of the way... and Thomas kneels beside his wife... She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes... He takes her hand...
C: THOMAS BUTTON
D: I came as quickly as I could... I'm sorry I took so long, the streets are filled with people...
E: CONT'D
N: As if to underscore it, fireworks go off...
C: THOMAS BUTTON
D: You are going to be alright, my dearest darling... I will not let anything happen to you...
E: CONT'D
C: HIS YOUNG WIFE
D: Promise me, Thomas...
N: And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY. But Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...
C: HIS YOUNG WIFE
D: Promise me, he has a place...
E: CONT'D
N: He doesn't understand... She looks up at him... holds his hand tight... then she slips away... The Doctor listening for her pulse... He covers her... it's quiet... the Priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids crying...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: She gave her life for me... And for that I am forever grateful...
E: V.O.
N: Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go... When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor, or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to lift it, to see his son's face...
C: MAID
D: Mr. Button...!
N: He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh." And then he suddenly snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of the room... downstairs... outside...
S: EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918
N: ... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY, through the streets... Pushing through crowds...
S: EXT. A BRIDGE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918
N: ... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark... brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when, despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it... Instead, cradles the newborn...
C: THOMAS
D: I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
N: A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way...
C: POLICEMAN
D: What are you doing there!?
N: The BABY starts to CRY...
C: POLICEMAN
D: What do you have there?
E: CONT'D
N: Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas, carrying the CRYING BABY, running...
S: 23A EXT. NEW ORLEANS, GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1918 23A
N: Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the large old moldering antebellum houses...
S: EXT. THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918
N: He comes to an old three-story house with a screened porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light, by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath... He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has, tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can just see the figures of two people coming from inside... Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his decision made, he turns, moving away from the house, leaving his child behind.
C: A WOMAN'S
D: I could've sworn I heard somebody knockin'...
E: V.O.
N: When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s, with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR. WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the door, and not seeing anything...
C: QUEENIE
D: I guess not...
N: She stands for a moment taking in the night air...
C: QUEENIE
D: The air smells sweet...
E: CONT'D
N: And she sings to herself... a song from the time...
C: TIZZY
D: You look very handsome tonight, Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever seen you... The green matches your eyes...
C: QUEENIE
D: It isn't everyday a war's over, Mr. Weathers...
E: fingering dress MORE
C: QUEENIE
D: We have to mark it somehow... You ain't no slouch yourself.
E: CONT'D
N: He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet...
C: TIZZY
D: Hambert's back in town... came home legless, but he home... we're gonna throw a party for him... help get himself situated... I know you was sweet on him one time...
E: beat
C: QUEENIE
D: Sweeter than I shoulda been... Lost his legs you say? "You never know what's comin' for you."
N: And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head out...
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Ms. Simone messed herself...
C: QUEENIE
D: She got to stop doing that, or it's diapers for her... I'll be right there, Mrs. Jameson...
N: The woman disappears inside. Queenie, not anxious to go...
C: QUEENIE
D: It sure is nice out here, Mr. Weathers...
E: CONT'D
C: TIZZY
D: Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come out back for a moment... take your mind away from things...
N: He pushes open the porch screen door...
C: QUEENIE
D: Just a moment's time...
E: smiles
N: He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles, nearly falls...
C: TIZZY
D: What in God's name...?!!
C: QUEENIE
D: What is that? A fish crawl out of the river...?
N: She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.
C: QUEENIE
D: God in heaven!
E: CONT'D
N: IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed old man...
C: QUEENIE
D: My Goodness, the Lord did something here...!
E: CONT'D
C: TIZZY
D: Look like a milk wagon run over it... three times... and back...
N: And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...
C: TIZZY
D: I didn't see it layin' there... I hope I didn't hurt it none... steppin' on it like that...
E: CONT'D
N: The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...
C: TIZZY
D: We best leave it to the police... I'll go --
E: CONT'D
N: Queenie hesitates... a longing.
C: QUEENIE
D: It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it...
N: And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering something, going in after her...
S: INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918
N: A piano's playing a standard, people singing.... There's a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of those who have lived and died here over many years... and we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to ninety-five, in various stages of health... various contraptions to keep them "afloat". An Old Age Home. We see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her, still anxiously whispering after her...
C: A WOMAN'S
D: Where are you, Queenie...?
E: V.O.
C: QUEENIE
D: Hold your water... Go see to them.
E: and to Tizzy
N: He does what she asks. She hurries the baby into a small room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...
S: INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM, OLD HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918
N: A small room tucked under the staircase...
C: A WOMAN'S
D: Queenie Apple... she went and messed herself all over again...
E: V.O.
C: QUEENIE
D: Jane Childress start her a bath... and mind your business, Mrs. Duprey... You'll be messing yourself soon enough too!
N: There's a KNOCK on Queenie's door.
C: A WOMAN'S
D: Somebody stole my necklace...
E: V.O. whispers
C: QUEENIE
D: I'll be right with you, Mrs. Hollister...
N: She whispers to The Baby, soothing it. And looking for a place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer...
C: QUEENIE
D: You may be as ugly as an old pot... but you still a child of God...
E: CONT'D
C: A WOMAN'S
D: Queenie, Apple... she won't go take a bath wit'out you...
E: V.O.
C: QUEENIE
D: Mercy, I'll be right there.
N: And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser drawer... with her unmentionables... and shuts it... leaving it open just a crack, enough to breathe... Turning, she sees an Old Woman, looking very lost, looking in the room...
C: MRS. HOLLISTER
D: My sister gave those pearls to me... I can't find them anywhere... People are stealing my jewelry...!
C: QUEENIE
D: They're right here, Mrs. Hollister, right 'round your pretty white neck... Come on now...
E: moving her
N: There's a sound of a door chime...
C: A WOMAN'S
D: Dr. Rose has arrived for his visit...
E: V.O.
N: Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby, and closes the door... And we stay behind for a moment... inside Queenie's underwear drawer, with the smell of a lilac sachet... is the Baby with the face of an old man... looking up at the sliver of light coming into the dresser drawer...
S: INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918
N: We see the Doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing examining one of the elderly boarders. He puts his things into his doctor's bag. Queenie comes beside him, saying something...
S: INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT, 1918
N: The Baby is lying on Queenie's bed... Dr. Rose, stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink.
C: DOCTOR ROSE
D: ... He's nearly blind from cataracts... I'm not sure he can hear... His bones indicate severe arthritis... His skin has lost all elasticity... His hands and feet are ossified... He has all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn, but of a man well in his eighties on the way to his grave...
C: QUEENIE
D: You mean to say he's dying?
C: DOCTOR ROSE
D: Of old age. His body is failing him before his life's begun.
N: They're still, looking at the strange baby.
C: DOCTOR ROSE
D: Where did he come from?
E: CONT'D
C: QUEENIE
D: It's my sister's child... From Lafayette. She had an unfortunate adventure. The poor child got the worse of it... came out white...
E: after a beat whispers
C: DOCTOR ROSE
D: There are places for 'unwanted' babies like these, Queenie... There's no room for another mouth to feed here... The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is... A baby here --
C: QUEENIE
D: You said he don't have long.
E: appealing
C: DOCTOR ROSE
D: Queenie -- some creatures aren't meant to survive.
N: She looks at the Baby, determined.
C: QUEENIE
D: He is a miracle, that's for certain... just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see...
S: INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1918
N: The Old People are sitting around the parlor talking, playing cards... Queenie brings the baby bundle into the room.
C: QUEENIE
D: You all listen...
N: And they stop what they are doing...
C: QUEENIE
D: We have a visitor that will be staying with us for a little while... My sister had a child but couldn't see right by it... He's known as... Benjamin... Benjamin... He's not a well child... so we need to take very good care of him...
E: CONT'D a hesitation naming him she likes the sound of it
N: We see Tizzy's come out of the kitchen , watching with an air of strong disapproval... And an OLD WOMAN says...
C: ONE OF THE WOMEN
D: I had ten children... there's not a baby I can't care for... let me see him...
N: Queenie hesitates, and gives the Baby to her... The Old Woman pushes the blanket back from the baby's face...
C: THE OLD WOMAN
D: God in heaven, he looks just like my ex-husband...
E: startled
N: And there's laughter...
C: QUEENIE
D: He's prematurely old... Doctor Rose said he don't have much time on this earth...
C: A MAN
D: Join the club.
N: They all laugh. Their laughter makes the baby seem to smile... the lonely smile of an old, dying man.
S: INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT, 1918
N: We see Queenie, unable to sleep, lying in bed, looking out a small window... there's a light KNOCK on the door... Tizzy...
C: TIZZY
D: Hambert sends his remembrance to you.
N: She nods... The baby cries out... and then it's quiet...
C: TIZZY
D: Are you right out of your mind? I know you don't got all the parts it takes to make one of your own... but this isn't yours to keep... this isn't even human kind...
E: CONT'D meaning the baby
N: With nothing left to be said, he starts to go...
C: QUEENIE
D: Mr. Weathers. Stay with me tonight.
E: whispers
N: He slows. She's quiet. And she whispers:
C: QUEENIE
D: "You never know what's comin' for you."
E: CONT'D
N: And as they move to be with one another, to make love; we look over at the dresser drawer -- open just a crack... Benjamin lying among the unmentionables, looking out at the world...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: I found a home...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT
N: Caroline with the "journal" on her knees. Daisy, eyes closed... the wind gathered in strength... furiously knocking...
C: CAROLINE
D: Is any of this true?
C: DAISY
D: You have such a lovely voice.
N: Caroline shrugs. She looks through the "book..."
C: CAROLINE
D: Some pages seem to be torn out here...
N: She discovers inside...
C: CAROLINE
D: There's an old streetcar token.
E: CONT'D
N: She gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it. But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window...
C: DAISY
D: That clock... Just kept going, year after year after year...
S: INT. "NEW" TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1925
N: And we see "Mr. Cake's" clock with its cherubs pushing the "hands of progress," still marking time backwards... The year is now, "1925..."
S: INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM, NEW ORLEANS -
N: EVENING, 1925
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: "...I didn't know I was a child. I thought I was like everyone else who lived there, an old man, in my "golden years."
E: V.O.
N: The boarders eating dinner. Queenie, in a white uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come to know... the face of a very old man... The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small, shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might, banging it just for the hell of it making noise...
C: QUEENIE
D: Stop bangin' that fork... It's for eating, not for playin' with... And use your napkin, please Mr. Benjamin...
E: fixing it in his arthritic hand
N: And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man having dinner with his contemporaries.
S: EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925
N: A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six- year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough, sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking... Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children playing... people talking...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON
D: What's there?
N: Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall is lower and he just sees the street... children running on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off for a party... He leans forward to get an even better view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...
C: QUEENIE
D: Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come back here...!
N: ...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the safety of the old people... out of sight of the street...
S: INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925
N: The small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: I loved her very much. She was my mother.
E: V.O.
N: And he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie in bed, her "son", the "old man" on the floor...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON
D: Somedays I feel like I'm different from the day before...
C: QUEENIE
D: Everybody feels different about themselves one way or another. We're all goin' the same way, just taking different roads to get there... You're on your own road, Benjamin.
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON
D: How much longer do I have to live, Mother?
C: QUEENIE
D: Just be thankful you got what you're given. You already here longer than you supposed to be.
N: We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: Some nights, I would have to sleep alone.
E: V.O.
N: He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy going back down into the room to be with Queenie... shutting the door...
S: INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925
N: An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house.
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing. All the people sleeping. I felt safe.
E: V.O.
N: Be he still wants to know "What's over there?" He wheels himself over to sit at the window looking outside... looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate... trying to see what's dangerous...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: It was a place of great routine... Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather... General Winslow, U.S. Army Retired... raised the flag...
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925
N: And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING OPERA...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON
D: Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted opera singer... well, she'd sing, Wagner...
E: V.O.
S: INT. MRS. WAGNER'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925
N: We see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the top of her lungs... while, down the hall we see Queenie giving Benjamin a bath... massaging his poor crippled legs...
C: QUEENIE
D: We're gonna put some life into these old sticks for you... get you walkin'...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: Breakfast was served promptly at six.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925

S: INT. KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1925
N: Tizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him... putting away cans... reading from one of the labels...
C: BENJAMIN
D: Tomato, brown sugar, salt, myasses...
N: Tizzy swats at him with his dish towel...
C: TIZZY
D: "Molasses"...
N: And while washing the dishes...
C: TIZZY
D: I learned to read when I was five. My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor. He'd bring home every play for me to read. "Kind keepers of my weak decaying age, Let dying Mortimer here rest himself. Even like a man new haled from the rack. So fare my limbs with long imprisonment. And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death, Nestor-like aged in an age of care, Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."
E: CONT'D Shakespeare
N: Benjamin's mouth agape, awed, taken by him, his majesty.
C: TIZZY
D: You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you?
E: CONT'D
N: Benjamin never thought about it...
C: TIZZY
D: The actor my grandfather worked for was John Wilkes Booth. He killed Abraham Lincoln. You never know...
E: CONT'D
N: An old man looks in...
C: A MAN
D: When's dessert...?

C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: On Saturday nights I would go to Queenie's church...
E: V.O.
S: INT. CHURCH TENT, NEW ORLEANS - A SATURDAY NIGHT, 1926
N: A sweltering shout 'em up Negro gospel tent. Queenie pushes Benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people looking to be healed, bringing him face to face with a mountain of a PREACHER, pouring sweat and full of fire...
C: THE PREACHER
D: What can I do for you, Sister?
N: And Queenie whispers something to him.
C: THE PREACHER
D: Her parts are all twisted up inside so she can't have little children...
E: CONT'D
N: He puts his hand on her stomach...
C: PREACHER
D: Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins so she can bear the fruit of the womb. Out damnable affliction!
E: and shouts
N: He presses on her stomach... making Queenie nearly fall over... held up by a "NURSE" in a crisp white uniform. And once she's regained her balance...
C: THE PREACHER
D: And what's this old man's irrediction?
E: at Benjamin
C: QUEENIE
D: He's got the devil on his back... trying to ride him into the grave before his time...
C: THE PREACHER
D: Out, Zebuchar! Out, Beelzebub! How old are you?
E: touches Benjamin after a beat
N: And he says what is only true.
C: BENJAMIN
D: I'm seven, but I look a lot older.
C: PREACHER
D: God bless you. He's seven!
E: laughs
N: The congregation laughs...
C: THE PREACHER
D: This is a man who has optimism in his heart! Belief in his soul! We are all children in the eyes of God. Now we are going to get you out of that chair... we're gonna have you walk... In the name of God's glory, rise up!
E: his hands on Ben's shoulders
N: And Benjamin, doing what he's asked, barely able to, his legs akimbo, stands... The people all applaud...
C: THE PREACHER
D: Now God is going to see you the rest of the way... He's going to see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane...! He's going walk by himself on faith and divine inspiration alone...! We'll show that Devil where to go...! Walk on...!
E: CONT'D
N: And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor arthritic legs give out... and he sprawls to the floor... The Aides in white nurse's uniforms move to help, but:
C: THE PREACHER
D: Don't touch him! Rise up, old man!
E: CONT'D kneeling to Benjamin
N: But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor... The Preacher comes to his feet, standing like a mountain over him...
C: THE PREACHER
D: Rise up like Lazarus!
E: CONT'D
N: Benjamin still lies on the floor...
C: THE PREACHER
D: I said rise up!!
E: CONT'D
N: And Benjamin, slowly but surely, makes his way to his feet...
C: THE PREACHER
D: Yes, and say hallelujah! Now walk, my old friend... Walk on...!
E: CONT'D Hallelujah!
N: And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across the stage... The people urging him on... a string of "Hallelujahs...!" Queenie comes to join him... urging him...
C: QUEENIE
D: Let the Lord carry you... ...
N: ...The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord... Queenie and The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage... Benjamin making it to the other end... to a roar of "Amens"!
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: Now, when I look back on it, it was kind of miraculous... But you know the saying, "...the Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh away..."
E: V.O.
N: ... That mountain of a Preacher... in full exaltation to God...
C: THE PREACHER
D: Praise be to the Lord on the highest...!
N: Suddenly pitches over, flat on his face... Having had a spontaneous coronary... lying center-stage, deader than the proverbial doornail... The crisp uniformed "nurses" running to attend to him, and poor "old" Benjamin haplessly looking around.
S: INT. THE PARLOR ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY 1926
N: The people are gathered...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: There were birthdays...
E: V.O.
N: A lit cake is being brought in celebrating General Winslow's birthday. He stares at the cake, unhappily gets up, mutters something... and leaves. The oldsters eye the cake, and without a moment's hesitation, dig in...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON
D: And mortality was a common visitor to our house... People came and went... Death was so frequent, I was never afraid of it.

N: Benjamin with his wondrous ancient face sitting in his wheelchair with the old people on the porch... watching the sun go down...

N: We see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing with some metal army men... when Mr. Oti's distinctive laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs... Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... Mr. Oti, standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the help, telling them his life story... but it's a completely different tone... a mockery of white people and their insanity...
C: NGUNDA OTI
D: The Big White Man brings us to St. Louis, where they make our village at the 1904 World's Fair...

S: INT. BACK STAIRWELL, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930
N: The old house still. Daisy, moving quietly down the stairs. Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps, following her.
C: BENJAMIN
D: Where are we going?
E: whispers
N: She doesn't say anything. She leads him into the DINING ROOM... where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry...
C: DAISY
D: Under here...
N: And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table... Benjamin follows her into the "fort..."
C: DAISY
D: Nobody knows about this but us.
E: CONT'D
N: They sit... The little girl, and the old man with the maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret lair... She takes a candle out of the folds of her nightgown... She tries to light it, but doesn't really know how to use matches...
C: DAISY
D: Will you light it?
E: CONT'D
C: BENJAMIN
D: I'm not supposed to use matches...
C: DAISY
D: Don't be chicken...
N: Despite his caution, he lights the candle... the candlelight making it feel more secret...

E: whispers smiles
N: Daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight.
C: DAISY
D: You are different than anybody I have ever met. Can I?
N: She innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to see what it feels like... When suddenly a sheet is pulled back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there.
C: GRANDMA FULLER
D: What are you doing under there? Who's idea was this candle?
N: She angrily blows it out... and... to Daisy... taking her by the arm...
C: GRANDMA FULLER
D: It's after midnight, you come right out here and get back up to bed...! You are not to be playing together! Play with people your own age...! Now, you come back to bed, young lady...! You're too young to be wandering around in the night by yourself... You should be ashamed of yourself!
E: CONT'D and for Benjamin, but saying it to Daisy moving her along and a last word to Benjamin
N: And they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in her nightgown, standing in the doorway...
C: QUEENIE
D: You are a different child... a man child. People aren't going to understand how different you are.
C: BENJAMIN
D: What's wrong with me, Mother?
E: forlorn
C: QUEENIE
D: God hasn't said yet. Now, back to bed and behave yourself.
N: He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane, and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask. He looks at Benjamin as he goes by.
C: NGUNDA OTI
D: You get used to it...
E: takes a drink
C: QUEENIE
D: You get back in that bed or I'll cane your old ass!
E: V.O. shouts

C: NGUNDA OTI
D: We're not friends anymore. That's what happens with tall people.
N: He starts to go...
C: BENJAMIN
D: Goodbye...
N: And he's gone. Benjamin gets up going to the window. He looks outside. He can see Mr. Oti come onto the porch. There's a full moon. And as he walks off, his arrogant little walk, suitcase in hand, going out the gate, Benjamin watches him disappear into the night.

C: BENJAMIN
D: I'm Benjamin...
N: The woman starts to tell him her name... but we don't hear it because...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S

It takes us a moment to recognize her... the leggy thirteen year old girl is gone... replaced by a confident woman in her early twenties... with her red hair and her blue eyes she could be no one else but DAISY. Benjamin follows her progress, moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened windows... She moves gracefully past the porch with its swings... The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her, comes to greet her... Daisy going around to the back of the house... Benjamin moving to the back door, and just as Daisy starts to knock...

C: BENJAMIN
D: I heard that... I'm sorry...
C: DAISY
D: I've been wanting to get some of her things...
N: ...They go into her grandmother's room...
S: INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - TWILIGHT, 1945
N: Her grandmother's things are in boxes neatly stacked in a corner, waiting to be taken away... Daisy starts to go through them... Benjamin gives her a hand... As they go through things...
C: DAISY
D: I can't believe I open the door, and you're actually standing there...It must be fate... What do they call it, "Kismet"? I read a book about a man named Edgar Cayce, a psychic, everything is predetermined...I like to think it's fate. What do you think, Benjamin?
C: BENJAMIN
D: I don't know how it works, but I'm sure glad it happened...
N: They inadvertently touch... the electricity of friction... both aware of the closeness... they move ever so slightly apart...
C: DAISY
D: Have you been to New York...? It's just across the bridge from me... I can actually see the Empire State Building if I stand on my bed... Where have you been? Tell me everything. The last time you wrote you said you were in Russia? I always wanted to go to Russia... Is it as cold as they say...? You wrote you met somebody... did it work out...?
E: nervously
C: BENJAMIN
D: Remember this?
E: holding out
N: He's comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to them, Rudyard Kipling's "Just So." She sits on the bed... Benjamin sitting beside her... the two shoulder to shoulder... Daisy looking through the book... and reading....
C: DAISY
D: ...This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon..."
N: She looks at him.
C: DAISY
D: You don't look like an old man anymore...You always said you were different... I think you must be...

C: BENJAMIN
D: Are you hungry? Would you like to get something to eat?
C: DAISY
D: I would love that...
N: And the moment's gone...
S: EXT. A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT
N: ...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion... and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked, elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear Daisy's voice, from somewhere else...
C: DAISY'S
D: ...I danced for a man named Ballenchine...He's a famous choreographer. He said I had a perfect line. They asked Ballenchine to describe what he did. He said, "I'm a carpenter." Isn't that amazing? In one of his rehearsals a dancer fell. He put it into the production. Can you imagine that in a classical ballet? A dancer intentionally falling? He isn't the only one, Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein, Richard Pleasant, Lucia Chase...There's a whole new word for dance now, it's called abstract..."
E: V.0.
N: The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another man showing her inside... Benjamin forgotten for the slightest of moments at the door... going after her.
S: INT. NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT, 1945
N: A crowded New Orleans restaurant. Daisy as a maitre d in slow motion is showing her to a table... Men's, and even women's, eyes following her...
C: DAISY'S
D: ...They have torn up all the conventions... the straight up and down style, all the things that bound dancers...It's not about the formality of the dance...the classical structure...it's about what the dancer's feeling...there are no rules; the movement can be tense or relaxed, abrupt or flowing, carefree or somber, it may suggest love or hate, attraction or repulsion. The unexpected shifts of weight or energy -- not just to shock but to reinvent tradition...putting the familiar form to new and unexpected uses. It's so basic Just you alone with your body...
E: V.0.
N: They reach a table... A chair in slow motion swept out for her to sit... another man in slow motion putting a napkin in her lap...
C: DAISY
D: They understand America's vigor and physicality -- they understand the freshness of the American people at their most modern, at their best.
E: V.O
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: And she told me about this world that she was so attracted to... names that didn't mean a thing to me...I didn't really hear very much of what she was saying.
E: V.0.
N: We watch them at the table... Benjamin listening, appreciating her... her face aglow with the intensity and the passion of youth... Caviar is brought over... vodka... She screws up her mouth not wanting to eat... We can sense he's telling her, what he's learned from Elizabeth Abbott, how to savor it... He feeds her a spoonful... They drink the vodka washing it down... she laughs, delighted... And we now hear what she is saying...
C: DAISY
D: Oh my god, I've been just talking about myself...
E: realizing
C: BENJAMIN
D: I'm enjoying listening...
N: She takes out a cigarette... He instinctively looks for matches, a man gets there first, lighting her cigarette for her... he watches the smoke curl around her... appreciating her...

C: DAISY
D: I have to go back tomorrow... I wish I could stay...
N: They reach a GAZEBO... Not a soul around... They stand for a moment in the silence...
C: DAISY
D: In New York we stay up all night... I eat breakfast in a diner on Houston with red booths and watch the sun come up over the buildings... there's always something to do...
E: CONT'D
N: Which is in stark contrast to Benjamin's life... Daisy, takes off her shoes...
C: DAISY
D: Dancers... don't need costumes or scenery.
E: CONT'D
N: And showing him what she's been telling him about, she does a dance for him...
C: DAISY
D: I could imagine dancing completely naked...
E: CONT'D
N: Daisy, dancing for him... While she dances...
C: DAISY
D: Have you read "D.H. Lawrence," his books were banned... The words are like making love....
E: CONT'D
N: He stands, hands in his pockets appreciating her... she moves closer to him... She comes next to him and she kisses him... and when he doesn't respond... she tries a different tact...
C: DAISY
D: In our group... you have to trust people... not be afraid... Sex... is a big part of it... A lot of the dancers... are lesbians... A woman wanted me to sleep with her....
E: CONT'D
N: He's quiet.
C: DAISY
D: Does that upset you?
E: CONT'D
C: BENJAMIN
D: Which part?
C: DAISY
D: That someone wanted to sleep with me.
C: BENJAMIN
D: People should want to sleep with you... You're very desirable...
C: DAISY
D: Let's go back to the house... or get a room somewhere... we can put down your coat...
N: She takes his hand, as if to lead him to the dark of the park... There's nothing he'd like more... but...
C: BENJAMIN
D: It's not that I don't want to... I just can't... not tonight....Its just not...
C: DAISY
D: I'm old enough.
N: And despite how available she is, how desirable she is...
C: BENJAMIN
D: Go back to New York, Daisy... Be with the people you are so fond of... You can only be young once...
C: DAISY
D: Do you think you are too old for me... I've been with older men...
N: And when he still doesn't respond... Daisy, rejected, takes up her shoes... And she starts off... Benjamin coming beside her... but they're not really walking together anymore... and the time for them, this time, has gone away...
C: BENJAMIN BUTTON'S
D: You only get so many chances to be with someone... I let her go... and I missed it...
E: V.0.

We see Daisy, in her long skirt... helping pick up with her hands and her nimble toes, errant clothing, the jackets, the sweaters... It takes us a moment to recognize her... in the some twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her hair's cut short... and it's gone mostly gray... and, although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's posture, her head held high... carrying herself with grace... and one thing that will never change, are her unforgettable blue eyes... We hear the door opening... Daisy, busy gathering, saying her goodnights... glances toward the door across the studio... And she sees a young Man has come in, a young man in his twenties... standing silently, a stranger, standing by the door... Daisy, as she closes up the studio, makes her way toward him, saying goodnight to people... she bends to pick up a ballet slipper...

C: DAISY
D: Benjamin?
E: CONT'D
N: ...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are... sixteen years younger... in his 20s now... it's at once staggering and heartbreaking... what age can do... And she realizes, at that very moment, he was right all along...
C: DAISY
D: You're so young.

N: They look at each other... When she's able to find the words...
C: DAISY
D: Why did you come back?
E: CONT'D
C: BENJAMIN
D: I wanted to see you both.

C: CAROLINE
D: You ready, Mom?

C: DAISY
D: I have to go.
N: He nods. He walks by her, going out.

S: EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE - DAY, 1990
N: Daisy gets out. The taxi drives off. Daisy stops for a moment before she opens the gate. The house has fallen into disrepair. A solitary old man sits on the porch rocking and rocking. She goes up the walk and out of habit goes around the back porch... to the kitchen... going inside...
S: INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 1990
N: She comes into the kitchen. She moves down the hallway into the living room... The interior has also fallen on hard times.

N: And she sees his back... just a boy of 12 now... hunched over... trying to play the piano... trying to play the tune the woman had taught to him...
C: DAISY
D: Benjamin.
N: He turns at the sound of her voice. There is no indication he recognizes her at all.
C: BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
D: Do you know this song?
N: And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is nothing more than a child playing random notes.
C: DAISY
D: You play really beautifully.
N: She comes and touches his back... He shrinks from her touch.
C: THE MAN
D: He doesn't seem to like to be touched.
N: And while he tries to play...
C: THE MAN
D: The doctors said if they didn't know any better, he goes in and out of states of recognition, as if he had the beginnings of dementia...

C: BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
D: There's something about you... There's something about your eyes I remember from a long time ago...

C: DAISY
D: What do you mean?
C: BENJAMIN AT EIGHT
D: It's like there's this whole life I had and I can't remember what it was...
N: He's frustrated by it...
