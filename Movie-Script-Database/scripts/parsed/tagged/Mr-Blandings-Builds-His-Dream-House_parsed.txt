Born and raised right here, he's as typical a New Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet. At least he was. And if you want to know the real story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer and quote, best friend, unquote. Jim's one of those bright young men from Yale. Advertising business, lovely wife, two fine kids, makes almost fifteen thousand a year. Want to know why? Just look up there.

E: impressive; almost reverently
S: EXT. A LARGE NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: As CAMERA MOVES UP it and TOWARD a window:
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: For fourteen years Jim and Muriel had been living in their apartment over on East Seventy-fourth Street. It was just another of those wonderful crisp September mornings and the Blandings were still asleep. Just like millions of other people in good old Manhattan -- New York City -- U.S.A.
N: The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:
S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY
N: Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep in twin beds. The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge take up an inordinate amount of space. SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking morning of his life. Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them, however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears. We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of the Blandings' daily routine. Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens the door.
S: INT. THE CLOSET
N: This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms, it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns, slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance. Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it, leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom and into the narrow hall.
S: INT. THE HALL
N: A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room and the foyer. Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.
C: BETSY'S VOICE
D: Okay, dad.
C: JIM
D: Mm.
N: Jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the children's room, knocks. No sound. He opens the door and enters.
S: INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM
N: A small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements of adolescence. Joan, an eleven-year-old is asleep in one of the twin beds. Jim automatically pulls the covers clear off Joan's bed. She awakens, cocks an eye at him.
C: JOAN
D: Okay, dad.
C: JIM
D: Mm.
N: As she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, Jim exits into the hall.
S: INT. THE HALL
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room, on through the very small combination dining and breakfast nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. Gussie, the colored cook, greets him heartily.
C: GUSSIE
D: 'Morning, Mr. Blandings!
C: JIM
D: Mm.
E: a feeble attempt at a smile
N: Gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon, stirs and hands it to Jim who gulps it down, makes a slight face and pats his stomach. Gussie hands Jim a cup of black coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.
S: INT. THE HALL
N: Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe, towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud. Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.
S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM
N: Muriel is still asleep as Jim enters, walks over, nudges her.
C: JIM
D: Muriel.
C: MURIEL
D: Mm?
C: JIM
D: Coffee.
N: Muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, takes the cup.
C: MURIEL
D: Thank you, dear.
N: They kiss briefly. Muriel starts to sip the coffee as Jim goes to his chest of drawers. It consists of several rows of small drawers above and large drawers below. Jim ruffles through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look through the other drawers.
C: MURIEL
D: Looking for something, dear?
C: JIM
D: My socks.
E: briefly
C: MURIEL
D: Why don't you look in your sock drawer?
C: JIM
D: That's where I found my underwear.
E: with restraint
C: MURIEL
D: Oh. Well, try your underwear drawer.
E: brightly
C: JIM
D: I'm in my underwear drawer.
N: He reaches in and holds up one of Muriel's silk slips.
C: MURIEL
D: Well, they must be somewhere. Socks just don't get up and walk away by themselves.
E: sipping coffee attempt at morning cheeriness
C: JIM
D: Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a- half drawers were to be mine! I wish you'd tell Gussie --
E: strained patience
C: MURIEL
D: The closet! That's where they are. We put them in the closet.
C: JIM
D: Socks? In the closet?
C: MURIEL
D: Well, there didn't seem to be any room in the drawers...
C: JIM
D: And there's so much of it in the closet!
C: MURIEL
D: ...so Gussie and I decided that from now on we'll keep them in a basket on the shelf.
C: JIM
D: Well, thanks a lot!
N: He strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. As he does so, all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to explode, he looks at Muriel.
C: MURIEL
D: Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort to be a little less clumsy.
C: JIM
D: I'll try, dear.
E: barely containing himself
N: Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, takes another sip of coffee.
S: INT. THE HALL
N: Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe around her.
C: JOAN
D: Father, just one morning I wish you'd knock!
E: sharply
C: JIM
D: 'Morning, dear.
E: to her back as she walks away
N: Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.
S: INT. THE BATHROOM
N: Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about to use, frowns. WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves. CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he opens. CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life. CLOSE SHOT - JIM CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "Home On The Range."
T: DISSOLVE
N: JIM Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is singing a lusty chorus of "Home On The Range." Jim picks up his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach for a towel, start to dry herself. The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes into scene.
C: MURIEL
D: Excuse...
E: reaching for toothbrush
N: She takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he continues shaving. CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL CLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to her brush. JIM AND MURIEL Jim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his original position as he follows the mirror.
C: JIM
D: Excuse...
N: Muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They both hum "Home On The Range". Her mouth full, Muriel taps Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her face in the mirror.
C: JIM
D: If you don't mind, dear.
E: impatiently
N: As he steps back in front of the mirror, Muriel continues to look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. She decides she needs a little skin lotion.
C: MURIEL
D: Sorry.
E: as she steps in front of him
N: She again opens the cabinet. Jim once more follows the mirror around, nicks his face, gives up, stands glaring arms folded. Muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet.
C: MURIEL
D: Moment, dear.
C: JIM
D: Take your time. I can spare the blood.
C: MURIEL
D: Oh... cut yourself?
E: looks up
C: JIM
D: I cut myself every morning. I kind of look forward to it.
C: MURIEL
D: Why don't you get an electric razor?
C: JIM
D: Don't like them. No close shave.
E: trying to shave
C: MURIEL
D: Ridiculous! Bill Cole's been using one for years.
C: JIM
D: He doesn't have my beard!
C: MURIEL
D: That's silly. Bill's beard is just as tough and coarse and --
C: JIM
D: I'm not interested in discussing the grain and texture of Bill Cole's hair follicles before I've had my orange juice.
E: irritably
C: MURIEL
D: You don't have to carry on so. I only said, why don't you get an electric razor?
C: JIM
D: Because I prefer the cool, clean sweep of the tempered steel as it glides smoothly --
C: MURIEL
D: Stop writing advertising copy! Hurry up, dear, you'll be late for breakfast.
N: Muriel exits. Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a few deft strokes finishes shaving. As he reaches for the water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed in the middle. Reacting with annoyance, he meticulously smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. He opens the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. The iodine bottle pops out. He grimly catches it, studies his problem, has a solution. With his right hand he starts slowly to close the mirror door. Just before it closes, he slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle. He reacts masterfully at his triumph, picks up his robe and starts for the door. As he reaches it, there is the SOUND of the cabinet opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the washstand. As Jim winces,
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY
N: Narrow and small. The four Blandings are at breakfast, Jim and Muriel each reading his section of the morning paper, Betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook, Joan engrossed in a magazine of popular science. As we come in, Gussie, taking off the orange juice, is squeezing by Jim who accordingly and automatically ducks his head as she passes. Jim uncomfortably turns the newspaper to another page, folds it, reacts with pained but controlled exasperation.
C: JIM
D: ...Who did this?
N: INSERT NEWSPAPER, a section of which has been cut out. BACK TO SCENE.
C: BETSY
D: I did.
E: very matter-of-factly
N: She holds out her hand to Joan, who, automatically, and without looking up hands her the salt.
C: JIM
D: I have repeatedly told you -- -- don't cut up the morning paper until I've had a chance to look at it!
E: ducking as Gussie comes back with coffee
C: BETSY
D: I'm sorry, father. It's necessary research.
N: She hands the salt back to Joan who automatically passes it to Muriel.
C: JIM
D: I suppose this is another of Miss Stellwagon's so-called Progressive Projects?
E: with some sarcasm
C: MURIEL
D: Now dear, there just isn't any point in sending your children to an expensive school if you're going to undermine the teacher's authority in your own dining room.
E: using salt and handing it to Jim
C: JIM
D: I'm not undermining anything. I happen to be in the advertising business and keeping abreast of the times is important to me.
C: MURIEL
D: And so is your children's education.
C: JIM
D: That's not the point.
C: MURIEL
D: It certainly is.
C: JIM
D: It certainly is not!
C: JOAN
D: Bicker, bicker, bicker.
E: without looking up from her magazine
C: JIM
D: You eat your cornflakes!
N: Jim ducks as Gussie passes back on her way to the kitchen.
C: MURIEL
D: Joan, every time your father and I have a lively discussion we aren't necessarily bickering. What is it, dear, another English composition?
E: handing Joan toast to Betsy; solicitously
C: BETSY
D: Miss Stellwagon has assigned each of us to take a want ad and write a human interest theme about it. I found one typical of the disintegration of our present society.
E: taking toast from Joan to Jim; passing toast to him
C: JIM
D: I wasn't aware of the fact that our society was disintegrating.
E: taking toast, not looking up from his paper
C: BETSY
D: I didn't expect you to be, father. Miss Stellwagon says that middle- class people like us are all too prone to overlook the pressures and tensions which befall the less fortunate members of our community.
N: Jim puts down the paper, turns to Muriel.
C: JIM
D: Muriel, I know it's asking a lot, but just one morning I would like to sit down and have breakfast without social significance!
E: with great restraint
N: Picks up his paper.
C: MURIEL
D: Jim, you really might take a little more interest in your children's education.
C: JOAN
D: You can't squeeze blood from a turnip.
E: without looking up
N: Jim reacts with painful resignation, folds his arms, puts down the paper, turns slowly to Betsy.
C: JIM
D: All right. All right. I'll listen.
C: BETSY
D: It's just twenty-four words. But in simple eloquence it mirrors a minor tragedy of our times.
E: picking up her scrapbook
C: JIM
D: Well?...
E: quietly
C: BETSY
D: "Forced to sell. Farm dwelling, oak grove, apple orchard, trout stream, hay fields, four barns, seclusion, superb view, original beams, paved highway, acreage... Will sacrifice..."
E: reading with emotion
N: Pause.
C: JIM
D: Go on.
C: BETSY
D: That's all.
E: simply
C: JIM
D: That's all?!
C: BETSY
D: You don't see it, do you, father?
C: JIM
D: No. Fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper. What did you expect him to do, take it to the United Nations!
C: MURIEL
D: There must be more to it than that. Isn't there, dear?
E: to Betsy
C: BETSY
D: Certainly, mother. What some people don't see is the whole sordid picture. A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the wall by hardship, soil erosion, mortgages, everybody gobbling, gobbling, gobbling, until finally, in desperation, he is "forced to sell," and stoops to the crass commercialism of newspaper advertising.
C: JIM
D: Oh, indeed... crass commercialism... advertising...
E: muttering
C: JOAN
D: Miss Stellwagon says advertising is a basically parasitic profession.
E: nose in her magazine
C: JIM
D: Oh, she does?
E: with extreme control
C: JOAN
D: Miss Stellwagon says that advertising makes people who can't afford it buy things they don't want with money they haven't got.
C: JIM
D: Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right. Perhaps I ought to get out of this "basically parasitic profession," which at the moment is paying for her very fancy tuition, those extra French lessons, her progressive summer camp and for that matter, the very braces on your teeth!
E: elaborate sarcasm
C: MURIEL
D: I wish you wouldn't discuss money in front of the children.
C: JIM
D: Why not, they spend enough of it!
C: JOAN
D: Bicker, bicker, bicker.
N: As Jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper, the downstairs buzzer rings. Gussie enters, squeezes by Jim who automatically ducks, goes to the phone in b.g.
C: GUSSIE
D: Hello. Who? Miss Blandings, there's a Mr. Funkhauser wants to see you.
E: calls
C: MURIEL
D: Funkhauser? Oh, Mr. Funkhauser!
E: remembers
C: GUSSIE
D: That's what he says.
N: Muriel looks nervously at Jim who is preoccupied, reading his paper. Then she turns back to Gussie.
C: MURIEL
D: Uh -- better ask him to come up.
C: GUSSIE
D: Says to come up.
E: into phone
N: Gussie hangs up, squeezes by Jim, exits into the kitchen. Pause.
C: MURIEL
D: Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's here.
E: tentatively
C: JIM
D: ...Who?
E: looking up
C: MURIEL
D: You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that clever young interior decorator we met at the Collins' cocktail party?
C: JIM
D: What's he doing here?
E: distastefully
C: MURIEL
D: Well, I imagine he's brought the -- uh -- estimates.
E: nervously
C: JIM
D: ...Estimates?
E: blankly
C: MURIEL
D: Darling, you know how long we've said we've got to do something about this apartment, and, well, he called last week, and I had him come over, and he's got some simply wonderful ideas!
E: rapidly; to conceal a feeling of guilt
C: JIM
D: There couldn't be two Bunny Funkhausers, could there?
E: quietly
C: MURIEL
D: Why, no, dear.
C: JIM
D: Then this is the same clever young man who's responsible for that zebra- striped monstrosity in the Collins' living room?
C: MURIEL
D: That couch is terribly functional.
C: JIM
D: Phil Collins told me what he paid for all that function! If you think I'm going to --
E: angrily
N: SOUND of doorbell ringing.
C: MURIEL
D: Darling, please! Children, you'll be late to school. Run along and --
E: changing subject
N: The children rise, pick up their school paraphernalia.
C: JOAN
D: Miss Stellwagon says that functionalism in modern furniture --
C: MURIEL
D: Never mind, dear.
N: She hustles Betsy and Joan toward the foyer as Jim rises.
S: INT. FOYER
N: Gussie has just admitted Mr. Funkhauser. He is a tall, slender, effete-looking, young man. He is loaded down with sketches, samples of wallpaper, bolts of material. Betsy and Joan brush by him on their way out.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Good morning.
C: THE GIRLS
D: Hi.
E: with a sharp appraising look
N: As they rush out and the door closes, Jim and Muriel enter scene.
C: MURIEL
D: Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You remember Mr. Blandings?
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: But of course.
N: He sweeps by them into the living room, taking over completely.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: You'll have to pardon my bursting in at this dreary hour -- -- practically the middle of the night -- -- but I did so want to catch you in. I've been at it hammer and tongs all week and I'm just a mess -- -- but then Muriel and I thought we ought to talk it over with you before we take the plunge...
E: puts a sketch on a chair puts wallpaper against mantel drapes bolt of chintz over high-backed chair
N: Funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds flowing down in front. As Jim reacts:
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: After all, it's your home, too, and it should reflect you. You know, Man's Castle, all that sort of thing.
E: smoothing out folds on the chintz
N: Jim looks down at the chintz.
C: JIM
D: Muriel!
E: ominously
C: MURIEL
D: Jim, just wait till you hear. He's got some wonderful ideas for the foyer.
E: quickly
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the whole thing! I just couldn't live with it! I said to myself, "Bunny, what are the Blandings? How shall we do them?" And the answer was perfectly obvious. Very American, very grass roots, very blueberry pie -- that sort of thing.
C: JIM
D: Mm.
E: dark look at Muriel
N: Funkhauser fingers the material of a drape, disdainfully removes his hand.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Now first, let's dig into this living room of yours, it's really a dreary.
C: MURIEL
D: We want this room to be very gay, dear. Something in bright reds, yellows and greens.
E: quickly; to Jim
C: JIM
D: Red, yellow and green?!
E: appalled
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Oh, come, Mr. Blandings, let's not run away from color.
C: JIM
D: Not running away -- -- just backing off a little.
E: a lame joke
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Uh -- yes. Now as I see our room, it's definitely Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench, breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp, hooked rug. But everything in good taste. It must not jump out at you and scream: "Look -- see how antique I am!"
E: brightly
C: JIM
D: Heaven forbid.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Of course, these things take imagination. You've simply got to be able to visualize.
C: JIM
D: If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser, what I'd like to visualize -- at this dreary hour -- is how much is this all going to cost?
E: politely, removing chintz
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Well, really, I hesitate to say. After all -- -- by the time this wall is out we may find --
E: indicates
C: JIM
D: This wall is -- what?
E: reacting
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Out. Source of light is from the east. Obviously if our room is to have any function at all --
C: JIM
D: You're going to tear out the wall?!
C: MURIEL
D: Dear, it's a wonderful notion.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Visualize three feet of leaded panes, the rest --
C: JIM
D: Can you give me a figure?
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Well! Costs aren't what they used to be, you know, and --
C: JIM
D: Just a figure.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Materials are impossible, labor has just run wild --
C: JIM
D: Just an overall figure.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Well!... I shouldn't like to be tied down. But I suppose if you must have a figure, I'd say -- mm -- -- somewhere in the neighborhood of seven.
E: lightly
C: JIM
D: Mm... Seven.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Mm.
E: nodding
C: JIM
D: That would be seven... thousand?
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Mm.
N: Jim looks at Muriel, considers.
C: JIM
D: We-ll. That seems fair. After all, we're not running away from color -- -- and we are tearing out walls -- Mr. Funkhauser, do you have a card?
E: soberly gathering up materials picks up wallpaper picks up sketches
C: MURIEL
D: Jim, we haven't even discussed the rest of the house.
C: JIM
D: We will, dear.
E: leads the whole batch on Funkhauser
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Well, really, I --
E: huffy
C: JIM
D: We'll talk it all out and then we'll get in touch with Bunny.
E: deftly steering him toward the door
N: CAMERA TRUCKS with them to the door.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: Well, really, I mean, I was under the impression we'd come to some decision today.
C: JIM
D: I'm sure we will.
C: FUNKHAUSER
D: We-ll!
C: JIM
D: So nice of you to come. Good day.
E: puts Funkhauser's hat on his head
N: And Funkhauser is gone. Jim closes the door, turns ominously.
C: MURIEL
D: Now darling, you -- you just don't go to a man like Funkhauser and ask how much it's going to cost before you even know what he's going to do!
E: apprehensively
C: JIM
D: No, that would be too logical! Seven thousand dollars! Blueberry pie! I wouldn't put seventy-five cents into this broken-down rat trap!
C: MURIEL
D: It's our home, Jim. Betsy was practically born in this apartment.
E: sentimentally
C: JIM
D: That does not make it a national shrine! Seven thousand dollars and not one word about closets.
E: vehemently
C: MURIEL
D: Closets! You wouldn't even let him get to the bathroom!
C: JIM
D: I haven't got that kind of money!
C: MURIEL
D: The way you talk, Jim Blandings, you'd think I was some kind of congenital idiot!
C: JIM
D: Sometimes I'm beginning to wonder!
C: MURIEL
D: You can just get out of here!
E: furious
C: JIM
D: That's not a bad idea!
N: He angrily jerks open the hall closet door, pulls his hat down from the shelf, several hat boxes, some ski boots and a tennis racket tumbling down on his head. Jim jams his hat onto his head, takes a deep breath and storms out, slamming the door. Muriel walks over to the closet, is about to bend down and pick up a hatbox when all of her pent-up emotions explode. She kicks the hat box into the closet, slams the door, starts to cry.

D: ADVERTISING
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. JIM'S OFFICE - DAY
N: On the wall are various framed copies of Jim's handiwork. Most prominent are advertisements for a meat product called "Wham!" "A Whale of a Ham!" There is ample evidence of the fact that Jim's most successful slogan is: "When you've got the Whim - say 'Wham!'" Jim enters, goes to his desk, sits down, still emotionally upset. He glances at a photograph of Muriel, looks guiltily away, then back.
C: JIM
D: Sorry.
E: to photograph
N: His secretary enters.
C: MARY
D: Good morning, Mr. Blandings.
C: JIM
D: 'Morning.
E: briefly
C: MARY
D: You wanted to see the color copy from this month's House and Stream.
N: She hands him a magazine. He looks at it perfunctorily, is about to hand it back when his eye is caught by an ad on the back cover. INSERT THE BACK COVER - A COMMUNITY AND EXTOLLING LIFE IN THE COUNTRY INSERT THE BACK COVER - A community and extolling life in the country, sponsored by a group of realtors, local chamber of commerce etc. Over a pastoral scene of lovely little houses checkering a rolling landscape are the words: LIVE IN THE COUNTRY COME TO PEACEFUL CONNECTICUT TRADE CITY SOOT FOR SYLVAN CHARM In smaller type: CHOOSE YOUR OWN COMMUTING TIME HOUSES OLD AND NEW... ACREAGE Over this:

E: looking up; blankly

N: Without answering he turns back to the ad. The CAMERA COMES IN for a HEAD CLOSEUP as he studies the ad and on the sound track we hear:

S: INT. THE CAR - DAY - (PROCESS)
N: Jim and Muriel - They are leaving Manhattan, entering the Merritt Parkway. Muriel, wearing an orchid corsage, looks curiously at Jim. His answering gesture says, "Just wait and see." Over this:
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: -- But Muriel was a little tougher. I guess the corsage did it.
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. THE CAR - DAY
N: Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - They are driving through a beautiful Connecticut countryside. Mr. Smith, a local real estate dealer, is of that shrewd Yankee breed which specializes in the understatement, underselling school of salesmanship.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: There they are, two little fish from New York -- out in the deep deep waters of Connecticut real estate. That's Smith, the real estate salesman. Mighty shrewd cookie in a quiet sort of way. Never thought he'd get a bite this quick.
N: Smith looks speculatively at the Blandings.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Now he's sizing up the catch. "Mm. Let's see. Convertible -- orchids -- must be pretty well fixed. Wonder if they're lookers or buyers?"
N: Jim takes a deep breath, looks at Muriel as if to say, "Get that air!" Muriel smiles with approval. Jim pats her hand affectionately. Smith reacts.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: They're buyers. Yes, sir, Smith, looks like you're finally going to unload the old Hackett place. Now first thing is get 'em a little anxious.
E: confidentially
N: Jim slows down the car as they approach a rather picturesque- looking old Connecticut farmhouse. He and Muriel react with approval, look questioningly at Smith. Smith shakes his head, "no," as though to say, "Not nearly good enough for you."
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Th-a-a-t's right!

C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Now we're ready to gaff 'em.
C: SMITH
D: Well, folks, there she is -- the old Hackett Place.
E: proudly
N: The Blandings look off, react with interest and approval. WHAT THEY SEE -- BURROWED INTO THE UPWARD SLOPE What they see -- Burrowed into the upward slope of the land is the old Hackett farmhouse. If the roof seems to sway a little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady, charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy years come next April. However, the overall effect is definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty. In the back are a series of barns and behind them the rolling hills known as Bald Mountain.
C: SMITH'S VOICE
D: Fifty mighty pretty little acres...
N: JIM, MURIEL AND SMITH. JIM, MURIEL AND SMITH
C: MURIEL
D: It's simply charming!
E: involuntarily
N: Jim's look cautions against her over-enthusiasm.
C: MURIEL
D: That is, for an old house.
C: JIM
D: Of course, you understand, Mr. Smith, we're just window shopping, so to speak. Nothing really definite in mind.
E: casually
C: SMITH
D: Perfectly all right.
C: JIM
D: Mm. Not a bad-looking place, but it's certainly a lot older than anything we had in mind.
E: studies house; with assumed indifference
C: SMITH
D: She's no spring chicken -- -- but that's just what makes her such a buy.
E: sagely
N: They look at him curiously. Smith's attitude is matter-of- fact, almost without enthusiasm.
C: SMITH
D: This isn't just old timber, or a virgin stand oak grove other side of the trout stream, or a couple of fruit orchards... You're buying a piece of American history.
C: JIM
D: You don't say! How's that?
E: interested in spite of himself
C: SMITH
D: First year she was built, General Gates stopped right here to water his horses.
C: JIM
D: Oh! Old General Gates -- Civil War.
E: impressed
C: SMITH
D: Revolutionary War.
C: JIM
D: Oh. Oh, that General Gates. Hear that, honey, General Gates!
C: MURIEL
D: Wouldn't that make the house over a hundred years old?
E: with concern
C: SMITH
D: Hundred and seventy come next April.
E: proudly
N: The Blandings exchange a doubtful look which Smith catches.
C: SMITH
D: Now I'm not trying to sell you anything -- all I'm saying is that one of these days someone with a little vision and imagination's goin' to come along, and just steal this place -- and I mean steal it.
E: confidentially
N: The Blandings, as one, turn to the house with renewed interest. This is not lost on Smith.
C: SMITH
D: Mr. Blandings, I know you can look at that house and just about picture what a couple of coats of paint and a little pointing up here and there can do to it.
C: JIM
D: Mm.
N: The CAMERA MOVES TO a HEAD CLOSEUP of Jim as he begins to visualize WHAT HE SEES WHAT HE SEES - The Old Hackett Place suddenly DISSOLVES into the New Blandings' Place -- Jim's version. It is a lovely country house. Massive. Masculine. Jim, in jodhpurs, tweed coat, pipe and accompanied by two large Irish Setters, is proudly surveying his property. He nonchalantly holds a sleek, beautiful shotgun in the most precisely correct position. CLOSE SHOT - JIM'S FACE. CLOSE SHOT - Jim's face. His lips don't move but we hear his voice.
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: Hm. Wonder what he meant by "steal?"
N: THREE SHOT. THREE SHOT.
C: SMITH
D: And I guess I don't have to tell you, Mrs. Blandings, what a woman's touch could do to a place like this.
C: MURIEL
D: Well --
N: CAMERA MOVES to a HEAD CLOSEUP of Muriel as she starts to visualize. WHAT SHE SEES - THE OLD HACKETT PLACE WHAT SHE SEES - The Old Hackett Place DISSOLVES into a dainty, feminine cottage with criss-cross curtains at the window and a lovely little white rail fence enclosing "her garden." Muriel, in delightful gingham, is in the garden, admiring her latest triumph - the largest rose ever grown in Lansdale County. CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL'S FACE. CLOSE SHOT - Muriel's face. Her face is soft. Her lips don't move but we hear:
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: It is a nice old house. It just needs someone to love it, that's all.
N: THREE SHOT THREE SHOT
C: SMITH
D: Yes, sir, you've certainly got to visualize.
N: CAMERA MOVES to a HEAD CLOSEUP of Smith as he, too, begins to visualize. WHAT HE SEES - THE OLD HACKETT PLACE. WHAT HE SEES - The Old Hackett Place. Suddenly SUPERIMPOSED over it in large figures is: $9,000.00 GROUP SHOT - SMITH LOOKS AT HIM AND MURIEL GROUP SHOT - Smith looks at Him and Muriel who are looking at the house with unabashed affection. Jim's arm goes tenderly around Muriel's waist. Smith looks back at the house. WHAT HE SEES - THE OLD HACKETT PLACE. WHAT HE SEES - The Old Hackett Place. The $9,000.00 is quickly replaced by: $11,000.00 GROUP SHOT. GROUP SHOT.
C: SMITH
D: Shall we go up and take a look at her?
E: brightly
C: MURIEL
D: Well -- I -- suppose as long as we're here...
E: a little too casual
C: JIM
D: I guess it doesn't hurt to take a look.
E: same
N: As Smith precedes them up the path toward the house:
C: MURIEL
D: It does have possibilities. Do you think we can get it?
E: sotto

D: Like taking candy from a baby.
E: sotto

S: EXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY
N: Jim and Muriel precede Smith as they exit from the house. As Jim and Muriel carry on a sotto voce conversation, Smith looks off with some concern in the direction of the road.
C: MURIEL
D: It's wonderful, Jim! That master bedroom with those two closets!
C: JIM
D: Shh!
C: MURIEL
D: Funkhauser could do wonders with this --
C: JIM
D: Funkhauser will have nothing to do with this house! Shh!
E: firmly
N: Smith's face suddenly brightens as a weatherbeaten old car appears, turns up the driveway, stops.
C: HACKETT
D: Hi, George!
E: calling
C: SMITH
D: Hi, Eph! What do you know, it's Eph Hackett, owner of the place!
E: to the Blandings; feigned surprise
C: JIM
D: Well, you don't say.
E: pleased
N: Eph Hackett gets out of the car, saunters over. Hackett is a middle-aged, rural-looking, taciturn New Englander
C: SMITH
D: Eph, this is Mr. and Mrs. Blandings -- from New York City.
C: HACKETT
D: Howdy.
C: THE BLANDINGS
D: How do you do?
C: MURIEL
D: You certainly have a lovely place here, Mr. Hackett.
C: HACKETT
D: Ye-ap.
E: briefly
C: JIM
D: Mr. Hackett, we've just been talking to Smith here about -- uh -- taking the old place off your hands.
E: pleasantly
N: Hackett exchanges the briefest of looks with Smith who almost imperceptibly shakes his head "no."
C: HACKETT
D: Ain't for sale!
E: firmly
N: As the Blandings react with dismay:
C: SMITH
D: Why don't you folks just go out in back and take a look at the orchard?
E: smoothly
N: He gives them a wink which says, "Just leave it to me." The Blandings exchange a look, turn and walk off.
C: HACKETT
D: How'm I doin', George?
C: SMITH
D: Nice timin', Eph. Think we got something here.
C: HACKETT
D: They the same people you showed it to in nineteen-thirty-eight?
C: SMITH
D: They were lookers -- this is the real thing.
C: HACKETT
D: If they got five thousand dollars on 'em. don't let 'em get away.
C: SMITH
D: They already offered ten.
C: HACKETT
D: Y'don't say... What's my asking price?
E: mildly
C: SMITH
D: Fifteen...
C: HACKETT
D: A mite stiff...
C: SMITH
D: I've got 'em measured. They're gonna take the place for -- eleven thousand.
E: mellower turns, looks back at house
C: HACKETT
D: Make it eleven thousand five hundred fifty.

E: singing gaily to "Home On The Range"

C: MURIEL
D: Uh -- Jim?
C: JIM
D: Hm?
C: MURIEL
D: I was just wondering, dear. Ten thousand dollars is such an awful lot to offer --
N: Jim looks suspiciously at her, at the children, then back at her.
C: MURIEL
D: That is, for two people who don't know anything at all about real estate, or anything... I mean, don't you think perhaps we should have asked someone's professional advice?
E: Jim's look darkens
C: JIM
D: Like... say... a lawyer?
C: MURIEL
D: Well, Bill knows about these things and --
C: JIM
D: Muriel, for once in my life I'm going to make one small decision, on my own, without the legalistic machinations of Mr. Bill Cole.
C: MURIEL
D: It seems very peculiar that when your very best friend happens to be one of the very cleverest young lawyers in New York City --
C: JIM
D: Muriel, I don't want to hear another word about Bill Cole! Well, did your mother tell you about the house?
E: turns to children
C: BETSY
D: Yes.
C: JIM
D: Well?
C: JOAN
D: Miss Stellwagon says the current craze for modernizing old farmhouses is a form of totem worship.
C: JIM
D: Did it ever occur to you two that there may be some remote, intangible subjects upon which your Miss Irma Stellwagon is not the final authority?
E: with great restraint
C: JOAN
D: Why don't we buy a Solaxion house?
C: JIM
D: ...You know it's just barely conceivable -- What kind of a house?
C: JOAN
D: Solaxion. It's built on a mast like a tent and it revolves with the sun.
C: JIM
D: Oh, it... revolves... with the sun?
C: JOAN
D: That's right.
C: JIM
D: Who lives next door -- Buck Rogers?!
C: JOAN
D: It's the only practical way to live. When a new model comes out you trade the old one in like a used car.
C: JIM
D: Muriel --
E: plaintively
C: MURIEL
D: Children, you haven't even seen this house yet.
C: BETSY
D: Personally, I'd like a Crane Mobile home. It comes all folded up and all you do is plug it in for electricity and water and --
C: JIM
D: Now just a minute! What kind of children are these? Do you want to spend the rest of your lives in chromium tents and portable merry-go-rounds? This house was built before our country became a nation. It has dignity. It's -- it's --
E: to Muriel to girls
N: Gussie enters with a letter.
C: GUSSIE
D: Special delivery, Mr. Blandings.
E: handing it to Jim
C: JIM
D: From Smith!
E: with suppressed; excitement
N: As he eagerly opens it and reads, his face falls.
C: JIM
D: Mm.
C: MURIEL
D: Well?
C: JIM
D: "I have conveyed your offer of ten thousand dollars to Mr. Hackett and am sorry to say he is not interested. However, I feel..."
E: reading
C: MURIEL
D: Oh, dear. Maybe we should have gone a few dollars higher.
C: JIM
D: He's bluffing. Simple as that.
E: stoutly
C: JOAN
D: For ten thousand dollars we could get a Rockford Trailer and a Zamboni Power Unit. It's kitchen, bathroom and air conditioning all rolled up into --

D: Muriel, I'll let him push me to ten thousand, two hundred, but not a penny more!
E: firmly

N: JIM'S COST CHART INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - Rising diagonally and bisecting the chart is a line graduated in scale starting at $5000 and running up to around $17,000. Resting on the line at exactly $10,000 is a miniature of the old house. Fluttering across the scene from left to right is a letter from Smith on the stationery of the Lansdale Realty Co. As we see the letter and hear the voice of Smith, miniature figures of Smith and Hackett appear at the lower side of the house. Their shoulders start pushing the house up the graduated scale. Over this:
C: SMITH'S VOICE
D: "Dear Mr. Blandings: While your offer of ten thousand two hundred is still not acceptable to Ephemus Hackett --
N: A letter on Danton & Bascomb's stationery flutters across the screen from right to left. A miniature figure of Jim appears above the house, desperately pushing it back. Over this, we hear:
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: "Dear Mr. Smith: You may inform Mr. Hackett that the very highest I could possibly go --"
N: As a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first from left to right and then from right to left, and the house is jockeyed back and forth, they are punctuated with the following lines:
C: SMITH'S VOICE
D: "Dear Friend Blandings --"
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: "My dear Friend Smith --"
C: SMITH'S VOICE
D: "Dear Blandings --!"
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: "Dear Smith - !"
N: Throughout this Smith's voice remains bland and unperturbed while Jim's has the desperate, frenetic quality of a man being slowly pushed to the wall. The Special Effect concludes with the house finally and firmly at rest on the preordained $11,550. As the antagonists on both sides of the house relax, Smith reaches around in front of the house and shakes hands with Jim. It's a deal! About halfway through when the going gets tough, Jim beckons Muriel to help in the losing fight. As they now embrace, Smith and Hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation.

S: INT. BILL COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: A successful lawyer's office, the walls crowded with leather- bound books. Jim and Muriel are seated facing the large desk behind which sits Bill Cole. Bill finishes reading a series of papers, the sum total of correspondence between Jim and Mr. Smith. He sets down the papers, leans back thoughtfully. Jim and Muriel look at him with nervous but eager anticipation.
C: JIM
D: What do you think, Bill? Steal, huh?
E: not too sure
C: BILL
D: It certainly is.
E: drily
N: Jim looks triumphantly at Muriel.
C: BILL
D: Perhaps "steal" is an understatement -- "swindle" might be a little more appropriate.
C: JIM
D: Well, it wasn't much, Bill. I just saw a good thing and I -- What do you mean?
E: with pride take
C: BILL
D: Every time you get a little tight you weep on my shoulder about the advertising business and how it forces a sensitive soul like yourself to make a living by bamboozling the American public. I would say that a small part of this victimized group has now redressed the balance.
E: picks up Smith's correspondence
C: JIM
D: What are you talking about?
C: BILL
D: You! You've been taken to the cleaners and you don't even know your pants are off!
C: MURIEL
D: Dear, I told you. I said we should call Bill --
C: JIM
D: Never mind, Muriel! All right, just what's wrong with this deal?
E: to Bill; challengingly
C: BILL
D: First time around you offered ten thousand dollars for fifty acres, right?
C: JIM
D: What of it?
C: BILL
D: That's two hundred dollars an acre. I know that part of Connecticut and one hundred dollars an acre is standard top-gouge price to city slickers. When the natives sell to each other it's around forty or less.
C: MURIEL
D: Forty dollars an acre!
C: JIM
D: The man's entitled to a fair profit.
C: BILL
D: Not two hundred and eighty-four percent. And besides, you're not getting fifty acres, you're only getting thirty- five, more or less.
E: indicates papers
C: JIM
D: Where does it say that?
C: BILL
D: I refer to a rather obscure post- script on the back of the second letter from Friend Smith.
E: picks up letter
N: He hands the letter to Muriel.
C: MURIEL
D: "Incidentally, Mr. Hackett has been a little over-optimistic about the acreage. It will probably survey somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five acres, more or less, but I feel sure..."
E: reading
C: JIM
D: All right, so it's thirty-five! What's the difference? Do you know how many tennis courts you can get on thirty- five acres?
E: on the defensive
C: BILL
D: You're not spending eleven thousand five hundred dollars for tennis courts!
C: JIM
D: That's not the point!
C: BILL
D: That's precisely the point. We're going to write this Hackett a strong letter and tell him he can either kick in with those fifteen acres, reduce the price, or find another sucker.
E: very businesslike
C: JIM
D: We'll do no such thing! I'm not going to queer this deal over fifteen broken- down acres!
E: rising emotion
C: MURIEL
D: We were just going window shopping and so far it's cost us eleven thousand five hundred dollars and they even made us pay the commission!
E: to Bill
C: JIM
D: You don't understand business.
C: BILL
D: You mean extortion.
N: As Jim turns on Bill and is about to answer him explosively:
C: MURIEL
D: I wonder if we could get another two year lease on the apartment?
E: thoughtfully
C: JIM
D: Now wait a minute! You can't measure everything on a slide rule. This house has certain intangibles.
E: heatedly
C: BILL
D: Like what, for instance?
C: JIM
D: Like antique value, for instance! It just so happens that General Gates stopped right there, at that very house, to water his horses.
C: BILL
D: I don't care if General Grant dropped in for a scotch and soda -- you're still getting rocked!
C: JIM
D: That was a different war!
C: MURIEL
D: I think Bill's absolutely right.
C: JIM
D: Let me explain something. To both of you. For fifteen years I've been cooped up in a four room cracker box! Just getting shaved in the morning entitles a man to the Congressional Medal for bravery.
E: struggling to contain himself; quietly
C: BILL
D: That doesn't make this a good buy.
C: JIM
D: Bill -- Muriel and I have found what I am not ashamed to call our Dream House. It's like a fine painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, how much was the canvas, how much was the paint? You look at it and you say, "It's beautiful... I want it," and if it costs a few pennies more you pay it -- and gladly -- because you love it and you can't measure the things you love in dollars and cents!
N: Muriel looks at Jim, impressed, her face softening with compassion.
C: JIM
D: Well -- that's how I feel about this place. And when I sign those papers Saturday, I can look the world in the face and say, "It's mine! My house! My home! My thirty-five acres!"
E: emotionally spent
C: MURIEL
D: Our house. Our home. Our thirty-five acres...
E: coming over; moved, touched
N: They tenderly kiss.

D: "...to have and to hold to him, the said Grantee, his heirs and assigns to his and their own proper use and benefit forever."
E: with ministerial resonance
N: During this, and as a shaft of sunlight hits them, a beatific look comes across the faces of Jim and Muriel. For a moment it has become their wedding day. After a momentary pause:
C: JUDGE QUARLES
D: Subject to a six thousand dollar mortgage held by Ephemus Whittaker Hackett...
E: very businesslike
N: As the Blandings are startled back to grim reality:
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. RURAL COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: LONG SHOT - The Blandings' car. The Blandings and Bill Cole driving along. They approach a fork in the road which leads to a very old covered New England bridge. On the bridge is a sign which reads:
C: SHRUNK MILLS
D: 2 Mi.
N: They pause, turn, go through the bridge.
S: INT. THE CAR - (PROCESS)
N: As they drive through the dark interior of the bridge there is an appropriate rattling and rumbling of the ancient timbers.
S: EXT. THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
N: There is another fork in the road. Muriel points to the road to the right. Jim shakes his head, points to the road to the left. Muriel points to the right. Jim emphatically shakes his head, puts the car in gear, drives off on the road to the left. LONG SHOT - THE CAR LONG SHOT - the car. It goes up to the top of a hill, stops, starts up, disappears.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. A ROAD - DAY
N: As the car approaches, the CAMERA discloses it is back at the same covered bridge. The car stops.
S: INT. THE CAR
N: Jim reacts with annoyance, mops his brow.
C: BILL
D: Congress ought to pass a law. When a man buys a house in Lansdale County there's a prize -- he gets ten percent off if he can find it.
E: drily
S: EXT. THE BRIDGE
N: Jim backs up and, over Muriel's protestation that they go right, turns the car left.
T: DISSOLVE
N: LONG SHOT - THE CAR LONG SHOT - the car. It drives up an empty road, disappears.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. A ROAD - DAY
N: As the car approaches, the CAMERA reveals it is again back at the old covered bridge. The sign still reads: "SHRUNK MILLS - 2 Mi."
S: INT. THE CAR - DAY
N: Jim and Muriel look at each other with disgust and resignation.
C: JIM
D: What in the world are "Shrunk Mills?"
C: BILL
D: They are probably mills that have shrunk.
C: MURIEL
D: Well, you certainly aren't much of a help.
C: BILL
D: Look -- you really want to find that house of yours -- it's no problem.
E: wearily
N: They look at him curiously.
C: BILL
D: Just pretend you're one of General Gates' horses and you're thirsty... Now where would you go for a drink of water?
N: Jim looks at him darkly, drives through the bridge, turns right, as Muriel looks slightly triumphant.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - DAY
N: Jim, Muriel and Bill stand a little distance from the house, looking at it. A vast lilac spreads across it. The Blandings are in quiet rapture, and it is Bill who speaks first.
C: BILL
D: Well, I must admit it's a very beautiful thing.
E: frank and open
C: MURIEL
D: The house and the lilac are just the same age, Bill; if the lilac can live and be so old, so can the house. It just needs someone to love it, that's all.
E: misty
N: Three shingles slide from the roof. As Jim and Muriel react:
C: BILL
D: It's a good thing there are two of you -- one to love it and one to hold it up.
N: As Jim gives him a look:
C: BILL
D: What'd your engineer say when he checked over the foundation and that roof?
C: JIM
D: Who needs engineers? This isn't a train, you know.
C: BILL
D: I just saw it move.
C: JIM
D: This house has been standing since the second year of the Continental Congress. You take one look at it and shingles start to fall off!
N: As if on cue, a few more shingles slide off the roof, nearly hitting Jim.
C: BILL
D: Look -- let me do you a favor. I've got a client, crackerjack structural engineer, Joe Apollonio; he practically built the George Washington Bridge single-handed.
E: solicitously
C: JIM
D: Thanks a lot, but we're not building a bridge.
C: BILL
D: He's the follow who advised the Government not to raise the Normandie -- they didn't listen to him, cost them five million dollars.
C: JIM
D: You have my word, if I were raising the Normandie, I wouldn't make a move without Apollonio. Now would you like to come inside and look around?
E: indicates door
C: BILL
D: No thanks, I'll just stay out in the car and listen to "Life Can Be Beautiful."
E: a skeptical look at the roof
N: As Jim opens the door and disappears, there is a crash, followed by a series of other crashes. Muriel looks in, turns back to Bill.
C: MURIEL
D: I think you'd better contact Mr. Apollonio.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - DAY
N: Near the front entrance. After a moment, the door opens, and the Blandings and Mr. Apollonio emerge. Jim, limping, is aided and abetted by a cane. Apollonio is a stolid, New York construction man, replete with derby, blue serge suit, and cigar. A short rule sticks out of a back pocket. As they emerge, the Blandings are hopefully enthusiastic; Apollonio is thoughtfully noncommittal.
C: MURIEL
D: It has charm, hasn't it, Mr. Apollonio?
C: APOLLONIO
D: Uh-huh.
E: through his cigar
C: JIM
D: Of course, any small changes would have to conform with the character of the countryside.
C: APOLLONIO
D: Mm-hmm.
E: through his cigar
C: MURIEL
D: And yet still be functional.
N: Apollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house, kicks an exposed beam. It crumbles, apparently rotted by termites. Two shingles fall off. The Blandings watch him anxiously.
C: APOLLONIO
D: Uh-huh.
E: gazing upward; oblivious
N: As he thoughtfully rubs his chin, Jim, followed by Muriel, limps his way over to him.
C: JIM
D: Well, uh, what's your professional opinion?
N: Apollonio looks at the Blandings, at the house, then back at the Blandings. He takes the cigar from his mouth.
C: APOLLONIO
D: Tear it down.
C: JIM
D: Tear it down??!
E: appalled
C: APOLLONIO
D: If your chimney was shot and your sills was okay, I'd say go ahead, fix her up. If your sills was shot and your chimney was okay, again I'd say go ahead, fix her up. But your sills are shot and your chimney is shot.
N: During this speech Apollonio picks up a wooden frame, squares it with a pocket square, levels it on a fence, and looks through it at the house.
C: APOLLONIO
D: Take a look at the way she sags.
E: beckoning
N: The Blandings step over, look through the frame. WHAT THEY SEE. What they see. Outlined against the frame, the house slants, sagging perceptibly. THREE SHOT AS THE BLANDINGS REACT WITH SOME DISMAY THREE SHOT as the Blandings react with some dismay.
C: APOLLONIO
D: So I say don't throw good money after bad -- tear it down.
C: JIM
D: Thanks a lot.
E: coolly
C: APOLLONIO
D: It's okay.
N: He tips his hat, walks out of scene.
C: JIM
D: Bill Cole and his experts!
E: bitterly
C: MURIEL
D: Darling, we'll get our own experts.
E: bitterly
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE OLD HACKETT HOUSE - DAY
N: The Blandings have just finished surveying the house with Mr. Simpson, another expert.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: And so they got their own experts. Mr. Simpson said --
C: SIMPSON
D: Tear it down.
N: The Blandings look at each other.
T: FAST DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE OLD HACKETT HOUSE - DAY
N: The Blandings have just finished examining the house with Mr. Murphy, another expert.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: On the other hand, Mr. Murphy said --
C: MURPHY
D: I think you'd better tear it down.
N: The Blandings smile feebly.
T: FAST DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE OLD HACKETT HOUSE - DAY
N: The Blandings and Jones, another expert.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: And then just to be a wee bit different, Mr. Jones said --
C: JONES
D: Tear it down!
E: firmly; deep bass voiced
N: The Blandings are now considerably shaken.
T: DISSOLVE
N: A SHINGLE. A shingle. It reads in neat, conservative lettering:
C: HENRY L. SIMMS
D: ARCHITECT
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: And that's how our friend, Mr. Simms, came into it.
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. HENRY L. SIMMS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Jim, Muriel, Simms. The room is in quiet, good taste, a flagstone fireplace, modern steel casement windows, window seats, etc. The walls are crammed with books and photographs of Simms' handiwork. There are a couple of gold medal citations of his work conspicuously spaced around the room. Simms is a tweedy, pipe-smoking, conservative New Englander, a distinguished-looking local architect. He puffs thoughtfully on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old Hackett place, an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the window frame.
C: SIMMS
D: Of course you could fix up that old house. You can fix up any structure that's still standing. The sills and floors couldn't be worse, I grant you, and I guess you'd have to jack up that west corner at least three feet to make it level. Need new chimney. New roof. Complete new plumbing. Too bad you didn't buy it ten years ago. Could have fixed it up in jig time then, and it would have made some sense.
E: sigh
C: JIM
D: Uh-huh... mm-hmmm... uh-huh.
E: nervously nibbling at his nails
C: SIMMS
D: Fact is, before you're through, it would be less expensive to tear the old place down and build a new one, same size.
C: JIM
D: Mm. New house... New house.
E: as the notion sinks in, becomes attractive
C: MURIEL
D: You mean... for the same money... we could build a brand new house?
E: to Simms, with pleasant incredulity
C: SIMMS
D: It certainly wouldn't cost any more.
C: JIM
D: Hm... New house...
E: soberly
N: He turns and looks thoughtfully at Muriel who raises an interested eyebrow. Then, to Simms:
C: JIM
D: Just... what sort of thing do you have in mind?
E: tentatively
C: SIMMS
D: Well, I imagine the type of house you'd want would be something in quiet good taste, two story, frame and brick veneer construction -- modern, but of course fitting in with the architectural traditions of the countryside.
C: JIM
D: Well, I -- What do you think, Muriel?
C: MURIEL
D: I think it sounds fine.
C: SIMMS
D: Perhaps you'd like to see a basic floor plan -- -- something like this.
E: reaches into file behind him
N: Simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him, the Blandings moving around, flanking him. They examine the plan with interest. WHAT THEY SEE -- THE PLAN. What they see -- the plan. A simple master plan of a two story house, the names of the various rooms indicated. As he talks, we see Simms' hand, holding a pencil, point out the various rooms
C: SIMMS
D: First floor. Living room, study, dining room, kitchen, service porch, maid's room -- upstairs three family bedrooms with two adjoining baths.
N: THREE SHOT. THE BLANDINGS PRAISE THE PLAN THREE SHOT. The Blandings praise the plan with the uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen such a plan before in their lives.
C: MURIEL
D: It's very nice, I'm sure, but -- uh -- well -- doesn't it seem just a little bit conventional?
C: JIM
D: Yes, Simms, if we were going to build a house we want it -- well, you know -- just a little bit different.
C: SIMMS
D: Yes, of course.
E: he's heard all this before
C: JIM
D: Now, for instance --
E: takes Simms' pencil
N: THE DRAWING BOARD. THE DRAWING BOARD. Jim's pencil traces as he talks.
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: -- here in the study if we could just push out this wall a little -- and put in a built-in bar we could --
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: Excuse me, dear --
N: Her hand takes the pencil from his, starts to trace as she talks. Jim's fingers drum with the beginnings of impatience.
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: These bedrooms. They do seem rather small. And, of course we'd have to have a little dressing room -- and --
N: As she draws it in, Jim's hand takes the pencil. Muriel's fingers drum nervously.
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: And closets, Simms, lots of closets. If there's one thing this family needs, it's closets.
E: traces them in
C: SIMMS' VOICE
D: If I might make a suggestion --
E: as his hand reaches for the pencil
N: But Muriel's hand reaches the pencil first.
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: And bathrooms, Mr. Simms. Each bedroom must have at least one bathroom.
E: as she draws them in
C: SIMMS' VOICE
D: But that would be four bathrooms, Mrs. Blandings -- I think I'd better point out to you --
E: his hand reaches for the pencil
N: Jim's hand reaches the pencil before Simms. Now Simms' fingers and Muriel's drum in unison.
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: Just a minute. Do you think -- we might manage a little playroom in the basement, nothing tremendous, you know, something like this --
E: tracing
C: SIMMS' VOICE
D: Well, it's always possible, but at the moment our fundamental problem --
E: as his hand reaches for the pencil; cautiously
N: But Muriel's hand has the pencil.
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: And I've always wanted a little sewing room upstairs -- You know, a little utility room where I can be alone, and sew, or sulk, or on a rainy afternoon...
E: as she traces Jim's and Simms' fingers drum impatiently
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: Pardon me, dear. On that playroom, Simms, not too small. You know, plenty of room for ping-pong, darts, nice big poker table...
E: as his hand takes pencil
C: SIMMS' VOICE
D: If you don't mind, I --
E: as his hand reaches for another pencil
N: But Muriel has reached the pencil first. As she and Jim sketch simultaneously and the scene begins to DISSOLVE, we hear:
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: ...And off the kitchen, I'd like a little flower sink just to putter around in...
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: ...And a terrace off the study, with an owning and little outdoor fireplace...
T: DISSOLVE
N: THE DRAWING BOARD - THE ORIGINAL PLANS THE DRAWING BOARD - The original plans are lost in a maze of the Blandings' extensions, alterations and additions. THREE SHOT - THE THREE ARE SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED THREE SHOT - The three are somewhat exhausted, silently looking at the plans. Simms wearily runs his hand through his hair.
C: SIMMS
D: We-ll... let's just see what we have here. In the first place --
E: delicately
N: THE DRAWING BOARD - SIMMS' THE DRAWING BOARD - Simms' pencil indicates as he talks.
C: SIMMS' VOICE
D: -- I'm afraid you've got the upstairs about twice as big as the downstairs.
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: It's all those bathrooms.
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: It is not, it's all those closets.
N: THREE SHOT. THREE SHOT.
C: SIMMS
D: By extending this breakfast room you've eliminated the possibility of any stairs going to the second floor.
C: JIM
D: Oh, you can just shove those stairs in anywhere.
C: SIMMS
D: And, Mrs. Blandings, on that sewing room, the way you have it now, the chimney stack would come up right through the middle of the room, leaving you with something in the shape of a square doughnut. Which, of course, might be very warm in winter, but otherwise of doubtful utility.
E: patiently; almost paternally tactfully
C: MURIEL
D: You could always move the chimney somewhere else, couldn't you?
C: SIMMS
D: We-ll... Look, I think I know just about what you two have in mind. Why don't I go ahead with some preliminary plans and --
E: rising; resigned to his fate but tactful
C: JIM
D: You do that, Simms, but remember, we've got to hold it down to ten thousand.
E: hearty
C: SIMMS
D: That, I can tell you right now, is impossible. Even with a considerable trimming of the things you've indicated, I don't see how we can bring it in for less than twelve or twelve-five.
E: candid
C: JIM
D: Twelve-five! Well, I guess we're not going to quibble about a few pennies one way or the other.
E: looks at Muriel; then
C: MURIEL
D: No, you'll find Mr. Blandings never quibbles about pennies.
E: can't resist
C: SIMMS
D: And -- uh -- have you any notions about how you'd like the old place taken down?
C: JIM
D: Why don't we just blow on it?
E: a rueful joke
C: SIMMS
D: There's a good local house wrecker. I'll have him contact you.
E: wry smile
N: Jim expansively puts his arm around Simms' shoulders.
C: JIM
D: Fine. You just shoot ahead with those plans, and remember, try to keep it down to ten, ten-five.
C: SIMMS
D: Well -- we'll try.
E: doubtfully
N: As the Blandings walk to the door:
C: JIM
D: There's one good thing about getting that old relic down. Those original beams and everything -- this time somebody pays us.
N: As they go out the door:

S: EXT. ROAD NEAR OLD HACKETT HOUSE - DAY - WINTER - (PROCESS
N: MATTE SHOT) Old Hackett house matted to show winter sky, bare trees. In the f.g. bare ground with patches of snow. Eph Hackett is standing with one of the wreckers. In the b.g. we see the frame of the old house, firmly intact, the chimney still standing within it. There are mountains of shingles, splintered boards and other rubbish, piled about. The piles are reasonably neat and sorted.
C: HACKETT
D: Them beams is worth money. You payin' him, or he payin' you?
C: WRECKER
D: He's payin' me.
C: HACKETT
D: How much?
C: WRECKER
D: A thousand.
E: hesitating
C: HACKETT
D: A thousand!
C: WRECKER

S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jim, Muriel and Simms are going over the preliminary plans. Betsy and Joan are present, Betsy reading the Lansdale Blade and Joan reading a science book.
C: MURIEL
D: It's impossible. I don't see how we can cut another inch.
C: JIM
D: Honey, you heard Simms. As the house stands now it's over fifteen thousand dollars!
C: MURIEL
D: Well, it just doesn't seem possible -- for a house with such small rooms.
E: afterthought
C: SIMMS
D: Mrs. Blandings, I've already explained. It's not only the size of the rooms so much as it is the number. You see, our primary problem is one of cubage --
E: patiently
C: JIM
D: That's right, dear, cubage.
C: MURIEL
D: What's that?
C: JIM
D: Oh -- just a figure of speech.
E: sorry he got into it
C: MURIEL
D: But what does it mean?
C: JIM
D: Cubage. It's just the number of cubic feet that -- -- go into a cubic foot. Go on, Simms.
E: a little irritably lost, lamely
C: SIMMS
D: Now is it absolutely essential for each of your daughters to have her own room with two closets and a separate bath?
E: consulting plans
C: JIM
D: Yes. You see, er, my daughters are, er, approaching womanhood, and, er --
E: a look at the girls; clearing his throat
C: SIMMS
D: I hadn't realized they were approaching it quite so fast. Perhaps what you need is not so much a house as a series of little bungalows.
E: brief look at the girls to Jim
C: JIM
D: Hmmm. What about that silly flower sink? We could eliminate that.
E: examining plans
C: MURIEL
D: I beg your pardon.
C: JIM
D: Or that sewing room upstairs, that's certainly a waste.
C: MURIEL
D: If we're going to eliminate anything, we'll lose that ridiculous play room in the basement with that great big poker table.
C: JIM
D: Honey, I've got to have some relaxation.
C: MURIEL
D: We've got thirty-one and a half acres. Go out in the back and do a little gardening.
C: JIM
D: Sure, and get poison ivy!
C: SIMMS
D: If I may interrupt, I'd like to suggest that none of these are really major eliminations. Now if we could do with one less bathroom on the second floor --
E: with dogged patience
C: MURIEL
D: I'm sorry. We couldn't possibly.
C: SIMMS
D: Mrs. Blandings, a simple bathroom, eight by ten by eight with grade A fixtures will cost around thirteen hundred dollars.
C: MURIEL
D: I refuse to endanger the health of my children in a house with less than four bathrooms.
C: JIM
D: For thirteen hundred dollars they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it!

C: BILL
D: Hello, Muriel. Well, you've done it again'. Once, just once, why don't you come to me and find out if it's all right, if it's legal, before you go barging off and run yourself smack into another jam!
E: briefly he strides past her waving a telegram; to Jim
C: JIM

D: And I must say, Simms, I hold you equally responsible!
E: ignoring him; to Simms

D: What? What happened?
E: alarmed

D: I'm afraid I don't understand.
C: BILL
D: Did you let this idiot tear down that house?
E: to Simms; indicating Jim
C: JIM
D: What if he did? What of it?
C: SIMMS
D: Reconstruction was unsound and totally impractical.
E: to Bill
C: BILL
D: I quite agree. But you're dealing with a man who doesn't think before he acts, who goes off half-cocked!
C: JIM
D: What is it? What did I do?
C: BILL
D: You're an architect! You must have been aware of the legality involved.
E: ignoring him; to Simms
C: JIM
D: What? What legality?
C: BILL
D: You knew there was a mortgage on that house.
E: to Simms
C: SIMMS
D: I assumed as much.
C: JIM
D: What happened? What are you talking about?
C: BILL
D: And you know the requirements in regard to a mortgage where there's demolition intended!
E: ignoring him; to Simms
C: SIMMS
D: Certainly. But since you were his lawyer, I naturally assumed --
C: BILL
D: With a man like this you can't assume anything!

D: It's the other way around, father.
C: JIM
D: You go to bed!
C: MURIEL
D: Girls!
C: JIM
D: Bill, I've had a very trying day. Would you mind telling me in clear, concise English just what crime I've committed -- and why?!
C: BILL
D: In clear, concise English, you tore down a house on which another man holds a mortgage without first getting his written permission.
E: with weary resignation
C: JIM
D: Well, I -- I did?!
C: BILL
D: And in such case, the mortgagee can demand the full payment of said mortgage upon demand -- and Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands! Six thousand clams! And he wants them now!
E: waves telegram
C: JIM
D: Now?!
E: appalled

D: What if something should happen? You can't leave the children unprotected.
C: JIM
D: I'm not dead yet! And if I die, there's plenty left to take care of them.
E: somewhat irritably
C: MURIEL
D: Not if you cash in your policies.
N: As Jim reacts with painful resignation:
C: BILL
D: I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll see the boys at the bank. Maybe you can put up your insurance as collateral. If necessary, I'll sign a personal note.
C: JIM
D: Thanks, Bill.
E: wearily
C: BILL
D: And Jim, do me a little favor. The next time you're going to do anything, or say anything, or buy anything, think it over very carefully, and when you're sure you're right -- forget the whole thing. Good night, Muriel.
E: paternally
N: He goes to Muriel and kisses her on the cheek. Jim sees it, is annoyed.
C: MURIEL
D: Good night, Bill.
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS Muriel and Bill to the door. He exits. Muriel comes back into the room.
C: MURIEL
D: What a wonderful friend.
C: JIM
D: What's with this kissing all of a sudden?
E: darkly
C: MURIEL
D: What's that?
C: JIM
D: Just because a man is helpful in a business way, it doesn't give him extra-curricular privileges with my wife!
C: MURIEL
D: That's a fine thing to say about a friend of fifteen years!
C: JIM
D: Well, I don't like it. Every time he goes out of this house, he shakes my hand and he kisses you.
E: testy
C: MURIEL
D: Would you prefer it the other way around?!
E: sharply
C: JIM
D: Well, I don't like it, that's all! Why is he always hanging around? Why doesn't he ever get married -- or something?
E: irritably
C: MURIEL
D: Because he can't find another girl as sweet and pretty and wholesome as I am.
E: assumed innocence
C: JIM
D: Well -- it -- it doesn't look right. There are limits to friendship and --
N: Muriel comes over, puts a sympathetic arm around him.
C: MURIEL
D: Darling, let's not be silly about this. It's not Bill, it's the house you're upset about.
C: JIM
D: I suppose so.
E: sigh
N: They kiss.
C: JIM
D: Do you think it's worth all this?
C: MURIEL
D: Of course, darling. We're not just building a house -- it's a home. A home for ourselves -- and our children -- and maybe our children's children.
C: JIM
D: It's getting awfully crowded with only three bathrooms.
E: whimsically
N: They look at each other, smile and kiss intimately, as we

S: INT. SIMMS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Jim and Muriel are watching Simms, who has just taken a typewritten sheet from his files. Simms looks at the sheet, turns to them a little apprehensively.
C: SIMMS
D: Well -- here are the estimates. Before you look at them, I think I'd better explain --
C: JIM
D: Don't bother, Simms. I'm getting to be an old hand at this sort of --
E: takes the sheet
N: Jim is halfway into his chair as his eye catches the first bid. There is a sharp MUSICAL EFFECT as Jim bounces out of his seat.
C: JIM
D: Jumping H. Mahogany --!!
N: The CAMERA GOES IN for a CLOSE SHOT of the column of estimates. As the CAMERA IRISES DOWN ON each sum, there is a dissonant MUSICAL EFFECT. Antonio Doloroso, Builders $32,117.00 Caries & Plumline $30,500.00 Julius Akimbo & Co. $28,575.00 Zach, Tophet & Payne $24,250.00 John Retch & Son $21,000.00 THREE SHOT JIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS THREE SHOT - Jim, Muriel, and Simms. Muriel has read the column over Jim's shoulder.
C: SIMMS
D: Now obviously these bids are way out of line, that is, all except John Retch and Son at twenty-one thousand.
C: MURIEL
D: Twenty-one thousand!
E: reacting
C: SIMMS
D: And with some judicious cutting, I think we can pare that down to eighteen.
C: MURIEL
D: We've only asked for the barest necessities --
C: SIMMS
D: Frankly, with all the extras you two have --
C: JIM
D: Never mind. If you'll just send us a bill for your services, I'll see that it's taken care of. Now, if you'll excuse us.
E: hands estimates to Simms takes Muriel's hand and starts for door
C: MURIEL
D: Where are we going?
C: JIM
D: I am going out to get my head examined! Then, if I don't jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to find the owner of our building and sign a twenty-year lease!
N: As they are about to exit, they pause as their eyes are caught by a drawing on an adjacent drawing board. WHAT THEY SEE - A BEAUTIFUL PENCIL AND CHARCOAL DRAWING What they see - a beautiful pencil and charcoal drawing of their completed prospective house. Under it, in neat letters is printed: RESIDENCE OF MR. AND MRS. JAMES H. BLANDINGS JIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS. Jim, Muriel, and Simms. They look at the drawing, then at each other. Jim's face softens. Muriel looks at him appealingly.
C: JIM
D: What's the name of that contractor?
E: quietly

N: INSERT JIM'S COST CHART. The house rests on the diagonal line at the figure of $13,500. As the miniscule Jim and Muriel watch with apprehension, the small figures of Smith and Hackett are joined by Simms, John W. Retch, and several sub contractors, who put their collective shoulders to the house and push it past the Blandings and up to $31,000.00

N: EXCAVATION - LOCATION #2 - EARLY SPRING - DAY A sign on a sawhorse - it reads: JOHN W. RETCH AND SON Over scene is the thunderous dissonance of the various SOUNDS that go into preliminary construction. A steam shovel in action, a bulldozer, the sawing of wood, and intermittently the loud, earth-shaking crash of a well-digger's rig. As the CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see the machines and workmen at their various tasks. The scene has all the rustic peace of the invasion of Hollandia. The ANGLE CHANGES, and we see Jim, Muriel, and Bill drive up the improvised driveway very close to the scene of activity.
S: INT. THE CAR - DAY
N: Jim and Muriel look at their property with unconcealed pride. Bill is interested but would like it better if there were less noise.
C: JIM
D: Well, things are certainly humming.
E: shouting over noise
C: BILL
D: What's that?
E: same
C: JIM
D: I said, humming.
E: same
C: BILL
D: Oh.
N: As they get out of the car, there is an unusually loud crash from the well-digger's rig.
C: BILL
D: What's going on over there?
E: loud
C: JIM
D: That's Mr. Tesander. He's digging our well.
E: same
C: BILL
D: Well? What happened to the trout stream, with that pure, clear, cold mountain water?
E: same
C: JIM
D: I decided against it --
E: same
N: There is a sudden cessation of the steam shovel and complete silence. Jim, unaware of it, continues to shout.
C: JIM
D: The trout stream -- didn't seem practical.
E: reacts; quietly
C: MURIEL
D: It wasn't exactly a decision, dear. We discovered the trout stream dries up in August and the rest of the year it's polluted.
E: to Bill
C: JIM
D: Well, anyway, I'd rather have artesian water. It's healthier. Calcium -- vitamins -- artesian --
E: defensively; groping
C: BILL
D: What's wrong with that steam shovel?
E: indicating
N: They look off. WHAT THEY SEE. A CLUSTER OF WORKMEN WHAT THEY SEE. A cluster of workmen have gathered around Mr. Zucca, the driver of the steam shovel, who is swearing in voluble but undistinguishable Italian. JIM, MURIEL AND BILL. Jim, Muriel and Bill.
C: JIM
D: Better take a look.
N: He starts off for the steam shovel, nimbly jumping over a drainage trench. Muriel starts to follow, pauses, unable to negotiate the trench.
C: MURIEL
D: Jim!
N: Jim turns in time to see Bill pick Muriel up and carry her across the trench. As he sets her down:
C: MURIEL
D: Thank you, dear.
E: sarcastic; to Jim
N: Jim frowns, annoyed. They approach the group around the shovel.
C: JIM
D: What's the matter, Mr. Zucca? Something wrong?
C: ZUCCA
D: How do you lika that? Broka my bucket. Two times this week I broka my bucket?
C: JIM
D: What did you do, strike a boulder?
C: ZUCCA
D: Atsa no boulder, atsa ledge.

C: ZUCCA
D: Meansa we gotta blast!
C: JIM
D: Blast?
C: ZUCCA
D: Blast. Witha dynamite.
C: JIM
D: What do you mean, dynamite?
C: MURIEL
D: What do you mean, "What do you mean?" Mr. Zucca just explained. He's going to use dynamite and blast until he gets rid of the rock.
E: a little annoyed
C: ZUCCA
D: Atsa no rock, atsa ledge.
C: BILL
D: What Mr. Blandings means is -- what precisely is a ledge?
C: ZUCCA
D: Ledge. Lika bigga stone, only a- bigger.
C: JIM
D: Like a boulder?
C: ZUCCA
D: No, like ledge.
N: Jim looks at Muriel and Bill.
C: BILL
D: ...Like a ledge.
C: ZUCCA
D: But you don't gotta worry. Only cost twenty-four cents a cubic foot, plussa dynamite an'a fuse.
C: JIM
D: But how far will you have to blast?
C: ZUCCA
D: Harda tell. Might be a lilla baby ledge -- mighta run the whole toppa the mountain.
C: JIM
D: At twenty-four cents a foot? Do you realize what that means?!
E: appalled
C: ZUCCA
D: Meansa we gotta blast.
E: simply
N: Zucca walks off.
C: JIM
D: Well, anyway, our house will never sink.
E: with quiet resignation
C: MURIEL
D: If it does, we can always get Mr. Apollonio. He raised the Normandie.
E: drily
N: There is a crash from the well-digging rig.
C: BILL
D: "Come to peaceful Connecticut -- Trade city soot for sylvan charm."
E: another crash
N: Another crash.
C: JIM
D: How long does that go on?
E: irritably
C: MURIEL
D: I don't know. Three weeks now at four dollars and fifty cents a foot.
E: to Bill
C: JIM
D: I think I'd better have a little talk with Mr. Tesander.
E: asserting his authority
N: He starts off. Muriel and Bill, curious, follow.
S: EXT. AT THE WELL RIG
N: Tesander, a stolid New England well-digger, the soul of industry and candor, attacks the earth. Jim, followed by Muriel and Bill, walks into scene, stands by, watching him. After a moment:
C: JIM
D: Oh -- Mr. Tesander --
N: The motor is making too much noise.
C: JIM
D: Mr. Tesander!
E: louder
N: Tesander looks up, shuts off his motor.
C: TESANDER
D: Yep?
C: JIM
D: How's it coming?
C: TESANDER
D: It's comin'.
E: considers a moment; then:
N: With a nod he turns on his motor, resumes work. Jim exchanges a look with Muriel and Bill.
C: JIM
D: No -- no -- I mean --
N: But he's drowned out by the motor.
C: JIM
D: Mr. Tesander!
E: shouts
N: Tesander patiently stops his motor, looks up.
C: TESANDER
D: Yep?
C: JIM
D: What I meant was -- how far down are you?
N: Tesander looks at his equipment, considers.
C: TESANDER
D: Oh -- 'bout a hundred and ninety feet.
C: JIM
D: Well -- isn't that pretty deep?
C: TESANDER
D: Yep.
E: thinks it over; he's not one for snap judgments; then:
N: He's about to turn on his motor, but Jim detains him.
C: JIM
D: Do you think maybe you'd better try another spot?
C: TESANDER
D: Up to you.
C: JIM
D: I mean -- well, have you hit anything yet at all?
C: TESANDER
D: Hit some limestone yesterday.
E: thinks it over
C: JIM
D: Is that good?
C: TESANDER
D: That's bad.
N: Jim looks at Bill who shakes his head with mock commiseration.
C: TESANDER
D: And right now it looks like we're coming into some shale.
C: JIM
D: That's bad?
C: TESANDER
D: That's good.
C: JIM
D: Oh...
N: Jim looks at Muriel for comfort which isn't forthcoming.
C: TESANDER
D: 'Course it might turn out to be sandstone.
C: JIM
D: That's bad?
N: Tesander shakes his head, "No."
C: JIM
D: That's good?
N: Tesander shakes his head, "No."
C: TESANDER
D: Can't tell. Might be good. Might be bad. One thing you know -- you got plenty of shale, sandstone and limestone.
C: JIM
D: ...I see.
N: He turns a little helplessly to Muriel and Bill.
C: BILL
D: On a hot day there's nothing like a nice cool limestone shower.
C: MURIEL
D: Mr. Tesander, just for the record, of course, what ever happened to water?
E: sweetly
C: TESANDER
D: Oh, it's there, all right. Just got to be patient.
E: he smiles, nods, tips his hat to Muriel
N: He turns on his motor, goes back to work. Jim, Muriel and Bill start to move off.
C: BILL
D: If you ask me, this project's getting a little out of hand.
C: JIM
D: Nothing's getting out of hand at all. I've made a chart of the whole operation, and -- with a few minor deviations, I know exactly what every penny's going to cost.
E: defensively indicates Tesander
C: MURIEL
D: Two pennies.
C: JIM
D: And just what does that mean?
E: coolly
C: BILL

N: There is a loud dynamite blast o.s. As a shower of dirt and rocks cascade down and they run for cover:

(4) Planks, shingles and plumbing equipment begin to arrive and are strewn about the property. (5) The exterior framing of the house begins to go up. (6) The sheathing is put on. (7) The roof is constructed.

N: After the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails brutally withdrawn from timber, a loud splintering of wood and then something of the appearance of entrails comes hurtling down end over end landing with a dusty slap at Jim's feet. The carpenter exits. Muriel gives Jim an accusing look.
C: JIM
D: It sounded less... expensive to say no.
E: sheepishly
N: There is another loud screech and more "entrails" come hurtling down, narrowly missing them. Muriel yells in the direction from which they came.
C: MURIEL
D: Stop it! Stop it!
N: From upstairs comes a long, shrill whistle. Instantly all sound of activity ceases and a voice is heard.
C: VOICE
D: Okay, fellas, let's quit!
C: JIM
D: Now look what you've done.
E: to Muriel
N: As Muriel turns with apprehension, eighteen workmen come trooping down the stairs.
C: JIM
D: Look, men, Mrs. Blandings didn't mean anything. I mean, there's no point in walking off a job just because... a woman makes a silly little remark.
E: conciliatory the workmen regard him curiously
C: WORKMAN
D: It's Saturday, mister. We quit at twelve o'clock. This ain't a chain gang, you know.
N: As the workmen exit the Blandings look at each other a little sheepishly, start up the stairs. CRANE SHOT - AS THE BLANDINGS GO UP THE STAIRS CRANE SHOT - as the Blandings go up the stairs.
C: MURIEL
D: I'm just sick. From the outside this house looks like a grain elevator, and on the inside everything's miles too small.

C: MURIEL
D: What's that?
C: JIM
D: What's what?
C: MURIEL
D: That noise -- listen. It's coming from the closet!
E: again the thumping
N: They rush to the closet, open the heavy oak door. Bill is inside, leaning disgustedly against the wall.
C: JIM
D: What happened?
C: BILL
D: The door blew shut. I got locked in.
C: JIM
D: Impossible. I had this closet built especially for myself. The lock opens from the inside.
C: BILL
D: Maybe for Houdini -- not for me.
N: As Bill starts to step out, Jim detains him.
C: JIM
D: Nothing to it. A child could work it. Look, I'll show you.
N: He steps inside with Bill, firmly closes the door. A moment's pause. The door re-opens.
C: JIM
D: You see, it just takes a little good old Yankee know-how.
E: condescendingly
C: MURIEL
D: You know, dear, it's just possible the lock worked for you and not for Bill.
C: JIM
D: Ridiculous. Even you could do it.
C: MURIEL
D: Thank you.

N: The knob turns, jiggles a little, but the door remains closed.
C: MURIEL'S VOICE
D: I don't seem to be able to ---
C: JIM'S VOICE
D: Here, let me show you! You just take the knob and turn it clockwise.
N: An efficient clockwise turn of the knob. Pause. An impatient doubletwist of the knob. Pause. A more forceful rattling of the knob, plus a slight kick. A furious rattling, pounding and kicking. The door remains closed.
S: INT. THE CLOSET
N: As Jim turns sheepishly:
C: BILL
D: Nothing like that good old Yankee know-how.
N: Jim turns back to the door, pounds on it, yelling:
C: JIM
D: Hey! Hey! Somebody let us out of here!
N: Silence. Muriel is at the shoulder-high circular frame solid glass window. She looks out.

N: He tests the window frame, finds it solid.
C: JIM
D: Seems a shame but I guess it's the only way...
E: still muttering

C: MURIEL
D: What are you going to do?
C: JIM
D: Don't get panicky, I'll get you out of here. Here, hold this over the window.
E: hands tar paper to Bill

C: JIM
D: Stand back, Muriel.
N: Jim raises the plank, takes a stance.
C: JIM
D: Ready?
E: to Bill
C: BILL
D: Roger.
N: Jim swings; the window shatters. Almost simultaneously there is a click and the door to the closet swings open. As Jim turns with a sense of accomplishment, his face falls as he and the others see that the erratic door has opened.
C: MURIEL
D: In case of emergency -- break glass. Come on, Bill.

D: He's only being helpful.
C: JIM
D: I thought he was a lawyer! Why isn't he out suing somebody?
E: annoyed; tears open a letter
C: JOAN
D: Bicker, bicker, bicker.
C: MURIEL
D: Another word and you don't get your laboratory.
E: to Joan
C: BETSY
D: Well, that's something!
N: Jim suddenly explodes, crumpling a letter he has just read.
C: JIM
D: We'll just see about that!
C: MURIEL
D: What is it, dear?
E: concerned
N: Ignoring her, he reaches for the phone, starts to dial.
C: MURIEL
D: Jim, what's the matter?
C: JIM
D: Mr. William Cole, please. Hello, Bill? I want you to fight this thing! I know my rights as a citizen! They can't get away with it!... What do you mean, what am I talking about? The letter, of course. From the owner of this building. They want us to move! It's a thirty day notice! But that's ridiculous. How can I move into a house that isn't even finished?! No windows, no plaster -- or paint, or -- or plumbing! Now you listen to me! I have no intention of moving in thirty days! This is not legal! I'm going to fight this thing! And I don't care if it takes every penny I've got! Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... All right!
E: into phone; sharply pause; then with rising emotion listens a moment listens a moment; then with rising emotion listens hangs up
C: MURIEL
D: ...Well?
E: expectantly
C: JIM
D: We're moving in thirty days.
E: quietly
N: On Muriel's reaction:
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. ROAD AND COVERED BRIDGE - DAY
N: Two moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause, over this, we hear:
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: So-came thirty days -- and they moved.
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BRIDGE. MED. CLOSE SHOT - Entrance to bridge. As the cavalcade passes through we see in the rear of the trailer, jammed among the household effects, Gussie and a very uncomfortable Mr. Bill Cole.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: I mean -- we moved.
N: OTHER END OF BRIDGE AND FORK The moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn. Jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite direction. Over this:
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: That's the wrong road! Any fool knows that!
E: as Jim would say it
N: Jim starts his car up leading the way.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. ROAD AT THE HOUSE - DAY
N: The moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway. Jim stops his car and they all look off at the house, react with pleasant surprise. WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE IS RAPIDLY NEARING COMPLETION. WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - The house is rapidly nearing completion. A half dozen men are finishing the exterior painting, planing down doors, etc. In front, a couple of men from the nursery are working on the landscaping. For the first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as a clean, bright and very attractive new house.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Well, there she is, bright and shining -- and just about complete -- the residence of Mr. and Mrs. James H. Blandings.
S: INT. THE CAR - DAY
N: MOVING SHOT - Jim and Muriel are visibly affected by the sight of their Dream House. They exchange a warm intimate smile.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Not bad at that.
S: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE - DAY
N: MED. SHOT. The car pulls up, stops.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: All right! -- Everybody out.
E: efficient scoutmaster
N: Everybody piles out of the car. As Jim and Muriel walk toward the house away from us and Bill, Muriel sentimentally reaches out, takes Jim's hand.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Guess you can't blame them for feeling just a little bit proud.
N: At the door, Jim stops, indicates that he'd like to carry Muriel across the threshold.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Look -- he wants to carry his wife across the threshold. Romantic, isn't it?
E: sentimentally
N: JOAN AND BETSY. Joan and Betsy. They look on with distinct adolescent disapproval.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Ooops! I guess I meant "corny."
N: GROUP SHOT. OVER MURIEL'S PLAYFUL PROTEST GROUP SHOT. Over Muriel's playful protest, Jim starts to pick her up.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Uh-uh. Watch that sacroiliac. Fifteen years since you've done this sort of thing.
N: Jim manages to lift Muriel.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Whew! Nice work, Tarzan. Now, let's see if you can make it into the hall.
N: Jim carries Muriel over the threshold and into the foyer.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: That's right. Go right in. Don't pay any attention to the sign.
N: The CAMERA PANS TO a LOW SHOT of a sign on the floor of the foyer. It reads: WET VARNISH FULL SHOT - FOYER. FULL SHOT - foyer. In the b.g. is a painter, varnishing the floor. He looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly varnished floor being violated. After a couple of steps, Jim stops, suddenly aware of the painter. The painter rises, throws down his brush, says something caustic.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Don't mind me, buddy, I just got through varnishing that floor.
E: imitating painter
N: Jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish practically holding it to the floor. Jim says something.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Whose bright idea was this?
N: The painter says something, points at Muriel. Jim looks darkly and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of guilt.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: She just wanted everything to be nice and shiny on the day they moved in.
N: Jim turns and shouts something to the painter.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Stop painting that floor and put some planks down in here, or some thing!
N: The painter shouts back.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Okay, mister, but take it easy. The Republicans ain't in yet, you know.
N: Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps. Each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.
S: EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE - DAY
N: As Jim appears, still carrying Muriel, Betsy and Joan catch his attention, indicate the front wall of the house which is complete except for the windows. Jim reacts.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Oh, fine! A house without windows! We'll just see about that!
N: Abruptly handing Muriel to Bill he starts off. Ahead of him and unnoticed are a layer of newspapers which have been spread out.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: Look out for those papers!
N: But Jim has stepped on the papers. They stick to his feet. After a few steps he is aware of it, tries to get rid of them. After a few hectic but futile attempts, he disgustedly disappears around a corner of the house, the newspapers flapping behind him.
S: EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
N: Jim flaps his way up to a workman who is staring at a pile of window casements.
C: JIM
D: Where's Simms?
C: WORKMAN
D: Around back trying to figure out what to do about them windows.
C: JIM
D: What's the problem? You put windows up.
C: WORKMAN
D: Not these. They don't fit.
C: JIM
D: Oh, they don't, don't they?
E: angrily; control going
N: He continues on toward the back of the house, the newspapers flapping beneath him.
S: EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY
N: Simms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against the wall. Simms and Retch react as they see an angry Jim Blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. Retch hands Jim a sheaf of papers.
C: RETCH
D: Oh, Mr. Blandings, you'd better look these over.
C: JIM
D: What's this about the windows?
C: SIMMS
D: I'm afraid there's a little slip-up. These windows seem to belong to a Mr. Landings in Fishkill, New York. I talked to Mr. Landings this morning.
E: calmly
C: JIM
D: Well, has he got mine?
C: SIMMS
D: No, he seems to have some windows that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of Peekskill.
C: JIM
D: Where are my windows?!
C: SIMMS
D: As near as we can figure out they've either been sent to a Mr. Benton in Evanston, Illinois, or a Mr. Bamberger of Phoenix, Arizona.
N: Bill wanders into scene, looks over Jim's shoulder.
C: JIM
D: What are we supposed to do -- live the rest of our lives in a house without windows?
C: SIMMS
D: It'll just be a matter of a few days.
C: BILL
D: What's a "Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R"?
C: JIM
D: How should I know?
C: BILL
D: You've got one.
E: indicating
C: JIM
D: "Furnishing and installing one Zuz- Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and eighty dollars!" I will not have any such piece of equipment in my house!
E: reading from bill explosively
C: SIMMS
D: I'm afraid I authorized that, Mr. Blandings -- to save your boiler and water pipes.
C: JIM
D: From what?!
C: SIMMS
D: Rust. The plumbing man assures us the water from your well is the most corrosive in his entire experience in the trade.
C: BILL
D: Another first!
C: JIM
D: Mm. Well, if it's necessary, put it in! We're moving in today, you know and --
E: pursing his lips irritably
C: RETCH
D: It's in.
C: JIM
D: Oh. Then get me the bill for it!
E: a final show of authority; sharply
C: BILL
D: You've got it.
E: indicating bill
C: JIM
D: All right then.
N: And he stalks off, his papers, shavings, etc. flapping behind him.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The moving vans are driving away.
S: INT. THE FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A general flurry of activity; Gussie and several workmen carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. Muriel, list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to Mr. PeDelford, a polite, cigar-smoking, noncommittal boss painter. In the b.g., casually leaning on the bannister is PeDelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical-looking assistant.
C: MURIEL
D: Now I want the living room to be a soft green. Not quite as bluish as a robin's egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil buds.
E: PeDelford nods
C: PEDELFORD
D: Mm.
C: MURIEL
D: The best sample I could get is a little too yellow, but don't let whoever mixes it go to the other extreme and get it too blue. It should just be sort of a grayish yellow green.
E: handing him a sample
C: PEDELFORD
D: Mm-hmm.
E: making a note
N: They turn to the dining room.
C: MURIEL
D: Now the dining room I'd like yellow. Not just yellow, a very gay yellow.
C: PEDELFORD
D: Mm-hmm.
C: MURIEL
D: Something bright and sunshiny. I tell you, Mr. PeDelford, if you'll just send one of your workmen to the A&P for a pound of their best butter and match it exactly, you can't go wrong.
E: sudden inspiration
C: PEDELFORD
D: Mm.
E: making a note
C: MURIEL
D: This is the paper we're going to use here in the foyer. It's flowered but I don't want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers. There are some little dots in the background, and it's these dots I want you to match. Not the little greenish dots near the hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom. Is that clear?
E: hands sample to him
N: PeDelford looks carefully at the sample, then:
C: PEDELFORD
D: Mm-hmm.
E: making note
C: MURIEL
D: The kitchen's to be white. Not a cold, antiseptic hospital white -- a little warmer but not to suggest any other color but white.
C: PEDELFORD
D: Mm.
E: note
C: MURIEL
D: Now for the powder room, I want you to match this thread. You can see it's practically an apple red. Somewhere between a healthy Winesap and an unripened Jonathan.
E: hands him thread
C: PEDELFORD
D: Mm.
E: making note
N: There is a crash from the kitchen.
C: MURIEL
D: Will you excuse me?
N: Muriel hastily exits toward the kitchen. PeDelford turns to his assistant.
C: PEDELFORD
D: Got it, Charlie?
C: CHARLIE
D: Green, yellow, blue, white, red.
E: deadpan; indicating rooms with his thumb
C: PEDELFORD
D: Check.
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. PANTRY - OFF KITCHEN - DAY
N: Joan is on a stepladder helping Gussie put away some dishes. Remains of two broken plates are on the floor below them.
C: MURIEL
D: Joan, you know father was to take care of the heavy dishes.
C: JOAN
D: He disappeared. I haven't seen him for an hour.
N: Betsy flies into the room waving a railroad timetable.
C: BETSY
D: Where's Uncle Bill? I just checked the timetable -- he's going to miss his train.
C: MURIEL
D: If they've run off somewhere it certainly isn't very --
E: suddenly stops, listens
N: From upstairs comes the SOUND of a steady, methodical thumping of a hand on a solid oak door.
C: MURIEL
D: Heavens!
N: She rushes for the door.
T: QUICK DISSOLVE
N: UPSTAIRS LANDING Muriel opens the closet door revealing Jim and Bill, who have been locked in the closet for the last hour. Each leans against the wall, arms folded, in an attitude of boredom and disgust. Without a word Jim and Bill exit from the closet. The three start down the stairs.
C: JIM
D: I thought you were going to take care of it.
E: darkly
C: MURIEL
D: I thought you were.
C: BETSY
D: You're going to miss your train, Uncle Bill! It leaves Lansdale in twenty-five minutes.
E: from below
C: BILL
D: Isn't there a later one?
C: BETSY
D: Not till the Commuter's Special tomorrow morning at six-fifteen.
C: JIM
D: You mean seven-fifteen.
C: BETSY
D: No, Dad, six-fifteen.
C: JIM
D: What about the seven-fifteen I'm supposed to take to the office every morning?!
C: BETSY
D: There's a little asterisk. The seven- fifteen only runs Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
E: consulting timetable
C: JIM
D: Let me see that! Muriel!
E: taking timetable scans table, tightlipped
C: MURIEL
D: Oh, dear, don't tell me I read it wrong.
C: JIM
D: That's fine! For the rest of my life I'm going to have to get up at five o'clock in the morning to catch the six-fifteen, to get to my office by eight, which doesn't even open until nine -- and which I never get to until ten!
C: MURIEL
D: Perhaps if you started earlier you could quit earlier.
C: JIM
D: So I could get home earlier to go to bed earlier to get up earlier!
E: sharply
C: BILL
D: Maybe you can have the railroad push the train up to four-fifteen -- then you won't have to go to bed at all!
C: BETSY
D: Uncle Bill, you're going to miss your train!
C: MURIEL
D: Jim, you clean up this mess. I'll drive Bill to the station and pick up some cold cuts for dinner.
N: Betsy and Joan pick up some boxes and walk into the dining room.
C: BETSY
D: You'd better hurry!
C: BILL
D: Kind of hate to leave that little place. Just four walls and a couple of mothballs, but to me it'll always be home.
E: indicating upstairs closet
C: JIM
D: So long, Bill.
E: preoccupied with timetable
N: Bill and Muriel exit.
S: INT. THE DINING ROOM
N: As Jim drifts in, still preoccupied with timetable:
C: JOAN
D: It's certainly going to be fun this summer when Uncle Bill comes up for his vacation.
C: BETSY
D: We'll get in a lot of doubles.
C: JIM
D: Hmm? What are you talking about? Bill's going to Europe.
E: looks up from timetable
C: BETSY
D: No, he's not. I heard him and mother talking. He's going to move his vacation up and take a place in Lansdale.
C: JIM
D: Uh-huh... Mm-hm. Mm-hm... Uh-huh. All right, come on, come on. Get busy.
E: vaguely annoyed then, covering up
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' CAR - (PROCESS)
N: Evening is beginning to fall as Muriel drives Bill into town.
C: MURIEL
D: I'll scout around and find you a place in Lansdale. Now, you're not going to change your mind about coming up?
E: quickly
C: BILL
D: Don't worry, I'll be on the job.
C: MURIEL
D: It won't be easy. I promise you a Cook's tour of every lamp maker, rug weaver, and antique shop in Lansdale County.
C: BILL
D: When I married you two I suppose I took you for better or for worse.
E: philosophically
N: Muriel smiles warmly, and in a friendly gesture reaches over and pats his hand.
C: MURIEL
D: Good old Uncle Bill.
C: BILL
D: Good old Uncle Bill.
E: drily
N: As they exchange an understanding smile:
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: It is dark outside and getting quite chilly. The children are unpacking a last barrel. They have made a rather unsteady pile of books and boxes, obviously Muriel's personal effects. Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in the fireplace. The immediate result is a clouding of the room with smoke. As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime accumulation of sentimental trinkets.
C: JIM
D: Now look what you've done!
N: Betsy coughs her way to the fireplace, turns the flue handle. The smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts to clear.
C: BETSY
D: Father, the first principle of lighting a fire is to see if the flue is open. A three-year-old child knows that.
C: JIM
D: Next time we want a fire I'll send out for a three-year-old child! Get that stuff cleaned up and go in and help Gussie set the table. It's getting late.
E: indicates trinkets
N: The children start gathering up the debris. Joan picks up some trinkets which have spilled from a cardboard box.
C: JOAN
D: Look, Dad, your fraternity pins.
C: JIM
D: Pins? I only had one.
E: busy cleaning the fireplace
C: JOAN
D: There are two of them here.
C: JIM
D: All right, all right. Just put them away.
C: JOAN
D: Funny, this one says W.C. on the back. W.C.? William Cole! It must be Uncle Bill's!
E: examining them brightly
C: JIM
D: Huh? Let me see that. Hmmmm.
E: reaching for it examining pin
N: Betsy has picked up a small leather-bound book. She whistles.
C: JOAN
D: What's that?
C: BETSY
D: Mother's diary when she was in college. It's slightly torrid.
C: JOAN
D: Let's see.
E: coming over
C: JIM
D: That's none of your business!
E: sharply
C: BETSY
D: I'd say mother and Uncle Bill were somewhat of an item!
E: scanning page
C: JIM
D: People do not read other people's diaries! It's not a very nice thing to do! Now go in there and help Gussie with the table.
E: taking book from Betsy shooting them out
C: BETSY
D: What about --?
E: indicating debris
C: JIM
D: I'll take care of that. Now, shoo, shoo.
N: The children exit. Jim is about to put down the diary when his curiosity gets the better of him. Making sure he's unobserved, he sits down on a box, opens the book, starts to read. As his brows wrinkle with concern:
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The wind is howling, the trees swaying. The lights are on in the kitchen. CAMERA MOVES UP to the open kitchen window.
S: INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: The family, in overcoats, is huddled around the kitchen table finishing dinner. Gussie, in overcoat and muffler, is clearing the dishes away. Jim, a sober look on his face, rises, takes a steaming kettle from the stove.
C: MURIEL
D: Where are you going?
C: JIM
D: To shave.
C: MURIEL
D: Tonight??
C: JIM
D: While I can still trust myself with a razor. At six o'clock in the morning I'd probably cut my throat. Goodnight.
N: Jim abruptly exits. Muriel looks after him with concern.
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Jim, in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving. After a few moments Muriel, in her nightgown and overcoat, enters the scene.
C: MURIEL
D: Excuse...
N: She takes her toothbrush and opens the cabinet, Jim automatically moving around back of it in their previously established pattern. As Muriel puts the paste on her brush, replaces the tube, shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her teeth, Jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position.
C: MURIEL
D: Excuse...
C: JIM
D: Muriel, do you have to do that now?!
C: MURIEL
D: There's no need to be so irritable just because you have to shave at night.
C: JIM
D: I'm not irritable!
C: MURIEL
D: Well, you're certainly something! You haven't said a civil word all evening.
C: JIM
D: Sometimes a man doesn't feel like talking.
C: MURIEL
D: What is it, dear? Something down at the office?
E: solicitously
C: JIM
D: No.
C: MURIEL
D: Have you got the new slogan for "Wham"?
C: JIM
D: It's not due yet!
C: MURIEL
D: Well, it's something. You're certainly upset about something. I can always tell.
C: JIM
D: I'm not upset. It's just that I don't happen to approve of falsehood and deception. Particularly in my own wife.
E: going back to shaving; with studied unconcern
C: MURIEL
D: What are you talking about?
C: JIM
D: Oh, nothing. It's just that I distinctly remember your telling me you gave back Bill's fraternity pin fifteen years ago.
E: same
N: Muriel looks at him, puzzled.
C: JIM
D: Well, did you or didn't you?
C: MURIEL
D: Did I, or didn't I what?
C: JIM
D: Give it back to him.
C: MURIEL
D: Of course I did. If I said I did, I did.
C: JIM
D: Then perhaps you'd have the goodness to explain how this happened to fall out of your jewel box?
E: suddenly Sam Spade
N: He takes the pin out of his pocket and hands it to her. Muriel takes the pin, looks at it sentimentally. Suddenly she looks at Jim and bursts out laughing.
C: JIM
D: What's so funny?
C: MURIEL
D: You! You're jealous! You're standing there with your face full of soap and you're jealous.
C: JIM
D: If you were so crazy about the guy, why didn't you marry him?!
E: angrily
C: MURIEL
D: Because I wasn't in love with him!
E: beginning to be a little angry
C: JIM
D: That's not what you said in your diary!
E: vindictively
C: MURIEL
D: Oh, now you've been reading my diary!
E: now really angry
C: JIM
D: Well -- it happened to fall open and... I... happened to look at it. It... just happened.
E: a little guilty
C: MURIEL
D: I'll just bet!
C: JIM
D: It's all over the book so why don't you admit it? You were in love with Bill Cole!
C: MURIEL
D: Don't be absurd! Of course I was in love with Bill. In those days I was in love with a new man every week.
C: JIM
D: Then why did you marry me?
C: MURIEL
D: I'm beginning to wonder! Maybe it was those big cow eyes of yours or that ridiculous hole in your chin! Maybe I knew that some day you'd bring me out to this thirty- eight thousand dollar icebox with a dried-up trout stream and no windows! Or maybe I just happened to fall in love with you -- but for heaven's sake, don't ask me why!
E: exploding
N: Muriel stalks out of the bathroom. Jim looks after her, thoughtfully starts to dry his face.
S: INT. THE BEDROOM
N: Jim enters. Muriel stands with her back to him angrily winding the clock. Jim noisily clears his throat. No reaction.
C: JIM
D: ...Muriel?
E: tentatively
N: No reaction.
C: JIM
D: ...Honey?
N: No reaction.
C: JIM
D: Would it do any good to say I'm sorry?
C: MURIEL
D: I don't know.
N: Jim gently turns her around facing him.
C: JIM
D: Well -- I am. I acted like a schoolboy and I'm sorry.
N: Muriel looks at Jim. Finally she smiles.
C: MURIEL
D: Oh, Jim!
N: She goes into his arms and they kiss intimately. As their lips part:
C: MURIEL
D: Why don't you take the soap out of your ears?
E: dreamily
C: JIM
D: Why do I love you so much?
E: same
N: Jim again kisses her tenderly, warmly.
C: MURIEL
D: Darling, it's awfully late.
E: breathless
N: Jim kisses her again, a little more ardently.
C: MURIEL
D: Maybe you ought to go down and lock the doors.
E: same
C: JIM
D: What for? The windows are all open anyway.
E: kissing her ear
C: MURIEL
D: Jim, you have to get up at six o'clock.
E: as he starts to kiss her again
C: JIM
D: Yes, I guess so.
E: considers; logic prevails; brief sigh
C: MURIEL
D: Goodnight, dear.
E: reluctantly
C: JIM
D: Goodnight.
E: same
N: Each gets into his own bed, still wearing the overcoats.
T: DISSOLVE
N: INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - The house now wavers at $37,000. As Jim and Muriel still try to stem the tide, the group that is pushing the house ever upward includes all of the previous people connected with the house and -- in addition --plumbers, painters, landscape gardeners, etc. Over this, and across the scene flutter more bills, more extras.
C: BILL'S VOICE
D: And so the days sped by -- and the bills -- and the extras -- and as the house approached forty thousand dollars, Jim approached his deadline for the new slogan. It was almost a photo finish.

S: EXT. RADIO CITY - NIGHT (STOCK)
N: It is raining. The lights are on in the buildings.
S: INT. JIM'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Mary is attending to some detail work as the door opens and Jim enters, disturbed. Mary looks at him questioningly.
C: JIM
D: You'd better send out for coffee and sandwiches,... It looks like an all night session.
C: MARY
D: What did he say?
E: concerned
C: JIM
D: Tomorrow morning.
E: wearily, seating himself at desk
C: MARY
D: Well, I guess you'll just have to dream something up -- good or bad.
E: sighs
C: JIM
D: I rather got the impression it had better be good.
C: MARY
D: Oh.
E: raised eyebrow
N: He picks up a pencil, nibbles on it thoughtfully. The silence in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the window. It strikes a note in Jim's subconscious. He swivels around in his chair and stares soberly out the window.
C: JIM
D: Funny how you look forward to the little things. Rain, for instance.
E: ruminatively, almost to himself
N: Mary looks at him curiously. He turns to her.
C: JIM
D: For a month now, I guess I've been looking forward to the first rainy night at the house. Big blazing fire. Muriel knitting. Me in my new smoking jacket... with my pipe and slippers, reading my paper... Oh, well.
E: looks at Muriel's picture sighs
N: As he starts to work.
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Note: The house is painted and almost completely furnished. A hard rain beats on the windows. There is a blazing fire in the fireplace. Muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole. Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes are hanging up to dry. The cozy tranquillity is broken by a sharp RINGING of the front doorbell.
C: MURIEL
D: Thank heavens! The children.
E: with relief
C: BILL
D: Stay put. You look too comfortable.
E: rising
N: The CAMERA FOLLOWS Bill to the front door. He opens it. A man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving rain. The man enters as Bill struggles to get the door shut against the wind.
C: MR. JONES
D: Whew! What a night! I'm Jones, from down the road. Just came over to tell you your kids are all right, Mr. Blandings.
C: BILL
D: Oh, I'm not Mr. Blandings. Cole's the name, Bill Cole.
N: He sees Jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an explanation is necessary.
C: BILL
D: Friend of the family. Wet clothes. Just came in out of the rain.
N: Muriel walks into scene. Jones takes in the bathrobe, again looks skeptically at Bill.
C: MURIEL
D: I'm Mrs. Blandings.
C: JONES
D: How do. Mrs. Williams just called. Says your phone's out of order. Wanted me to tell you the water's rising and they've got the bridge roped off. Girls'll spend the night over at her place.
C: MURIEL
D: Thank you. I was beginning to get concerned. Can I make you a cup of tea?
C: JONES
D: No, thanks. Better be gettin' back 'fore I have to swim for it. 'Night, Mrs. Blandings. 'Night, Mr. Bl--
E: to Bill
C: BILL
D: Cole. Bill Cole. Friend of the family. Just came in out of the rain.
E: weak smile
C: JONES
D: Well -- 'Night.
E: uncertainly
C: MURIEL
D: Goodnight... and thanks so much.
N: The door is opened with a terrific swirl of wind and rain. Jones exits as Muriel and Bill push the door against the wind, finally getting it shut.
C: BILL
D: That's fine. No bridge. How do I get back to Lansdale?
C: MURIEL
D: You'll just have to spend the night right here.
E: simply
N: As they start back into the living room:
C: BILL
D: Muriel, really! With your husband in New York and your children away -- think of my reputation.
C: MURIEL
D: Don't worry, Snow White, you'll be as pure and unsullied in the morning as you were the night before.
E: smile
C: BILL
D: That's the story of my life.
E: with resignation
N: Muriel pokes the dying fire, looks up thoughtfully.
C: MURIEL
D: Poor Jim, he sounded so worried before. I certainly hope he comes up with something.
C: BILL
D: Don't worry about the man who gave the world "When you've got the whim, say Wham!"-- This well will never run dry.
T: SLOW DISSOLVE
S: INT. JIM'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING
N: The CAMERA COMES IN ON a package of cigarettes. A finger impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.
C: JIM
D: "Compare the price, compare the slice, Take our advice -- Buy Wham!"
E: selling; a note of desperation in his voice
N: Mary critically shakes her head "no", closes her eye. Jim wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose, throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.
C: JIM
D: "If you'd buy better ham. You'd better buy Wham!"
C: MARY
D: It's Boyle Petroleum. "If you'd buy better oil, You'd better buy Boyle."
N: Her eye closes. Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping over the edge of the couch. It encounters a crumpled piece of paper, earlier work. He smoothes the paper, scans it, kind of likes it. He gets up, comes over, snaps fingers. Mary looks up.
C: JIM
D: "This little pig went to market As meek and as mild as a lamb. He smiled in his tracks When they slipped him the axe He knew he'd turn out to be Wham!"
N: A long silent look passes between them.
C: JIM
D: "...knew he'd turn out to be Wham!"
E: quietly
N: He suddenly and angrily gathers all his papers, slams them into the wastebasket.
C: JIM
D: It's gone! I've lost my touch! Maybe I never had a touch! Maybe "Whim Say Wham" was an accident! Who knows? I can't think any more! All I've got on my mind is a house with an eighteen thousand dollar mortgage, and bills, and extras, and antiques, and -- and -- I don't know... I don't know.
E: rising panic dejected
N: Mary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what to say. As the CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the emotionally distraught Jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his desk of Muriel and the children. He picks it up, looks at it with affection. Suddenly he gets an idea. Rising with determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door.
C: MARY
D: Where are you going?
E: startled
C: JIM
D: Home, to get some sleep -- and I'd advise you to do the same.
C: MARY
D: But -- but you haven't --
C: JIM
D: Suppose I haven't! This isn't the only job in town!
C: MARY
D: But -- but -- what'll I tell Mr. Dascomb?
C: JIM
D: You just tell him to -- to -- You just tell him!
E: sharply with finality
N: He exits.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. THE BLANDINGS' HOME - DAY
N: It is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. A rural- looking taxi deposits a weary Jim, who pays the driver. As the cab drives off, Jim looks speculatively at Simms' car, which is parked there, yawns, stretches, opens the door and enters. Under this a slightly sour underscoring of "Home On The Range."
S: INT. BLANDINGS LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: As Jim comes into the foyer, he sees Muriel, in nightgown and robe, talking to Mr. Simms. She holds the rolled-up volume of blueprints that went into building the house.
C: JIM
D: 'Morning, dear.
C: MURIEL
D: Darling, you must be exhausted. How did it go?
E: going to him; solicitously
C: JIM
D: Fine. Fine.
N: They kiss.
C: MURIEL
D: Is... everything all right?
E: obliquely
C: JIM
D: Everything's fine. Hello, Simms, what brings you out with the morning dew?
E: unenthusiastic still in embrace; looking up
C: SIMMS
D: Just dropped by to check the blueprints. Some extras came in from Retch this morning and there're a couple of things I thought we ought to go over together.
C: JIM
D: Really. What are they?
E: arms still around Muriel; unconcerned
C: SIMMS
D: Well, let's see. Few little things here, all right, I guess. "Mortising five butts -- a dollar sixty-eight."
E: thumbing through sheets
C: JIM
D: Let's not quibble about that. A man's entitled to mortise a few butts now and then.
C: SIMMS
D: Extra nails and screws -- three dollars, eighty-nine cents.
E: next sheet
C: JIM
D: Petty larceny, but let him get away with it.
C: SIMMS
D: Now there's one here I frankly don't understand. Ah, here we are. "Changes in closet, twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars." Did you authorize that?
E: reads
C: JIM
D: Well, we probably told him to -- Twelve hundred and what?!
E: reacting
C: SIMMS
D: Forty-seven dollars. Changes in closet.
E: hands bill to Jim
C: JIM
D: Who does he think we are! What's this notation: "Refer to Detail Sheet Number one thirty-five?"
E: explosively looks at bill; very businesslike
C: SIMMS
D: Far as I remember, that would be something in the back of the house. Let's just take a look.
E: indicating blueprints
N: As he unrolls the blueprints, Jim looks suspiciously at Muriel. She seems a little nervous.
C: SIMMS
D: Ah, here we are. It isn't a closet at all. It's off the back pantry... Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.
C: JIM
D: Oh... Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.
C: SIMMS
D: You didn't authorize any changes, did you?
E: to Muriel
C: MURIEL
D: Well... they certainly weren't changes.
E: defensively
C: JIM
D: What -- have -- you -- done?
C: MURIEL
D: I haven't done anything! And what I did was... just nothing at all.
E: speaking rapidly a little confused
C: JIM
D: What -- have -- you -- done?!
C: MURIEL
D: Well -- All I did was one day I saw four pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody wanted them and I asked Mr. Retch if he wouldn't just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flowers and things. That was absolutely all I did.
E: rattling off
N: During the above speech Simms sinks into a chair, puts his head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't lost on Jim.
C: JIM
D: That's all you did?
C: MURIEL
D: Absolutely. Just four little pieces of flagstone.
C: SIMMS
D: Did you by any chance authorize a drain?
E: to Muriel; wearily
C: MURIEL
D: Of course I didn't. All I said was I wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. Retch was just as nice as could be and said, "You're the doctor," and that's all anybody ever said to anybody about anything.
E: verge of tears
N: Jim takes a deep breath, turns to Simms.
C: JIM
D: ...Well?
C: SIMMS
D: All right, I think I can tell you what happened. First, the carpenters had to rip up the flooring that was already laid. Those planks run under the whole width of the pantry, so Retch had to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at them.
E: sigh; plunging in
N: JIM AND MURIEL Jim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were premeditating first-degree murder. She averts his gaze. Over this:
C: SIMMS' VOICE
D: Then he had to chop out the tops of the joists under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle. I guess he bought some iron straps and fastened them to a big pan to give him something to hold the cement. What with that added load on the weakened joists, I'll bet he had to put a lally column down there for support, too.
C: MURIEL
D: It was just four little pieces of flagstone, and I only ---
C: JIM
D: Quiet!
N: GROUP SHOT - DURING THE FOLLOWING SPEECH GROUP SHOT - During the following speech we see Bill Cole, in Jim's pajamas and robe come down the stairs and enter the room. Jim and Muriel are not aware of his presence.
C: SIMMS
D: Well, the main soil pipe runs under there on wall brackets, so Retch had to get his plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that cradle set. I guess that meant he had to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other. 'Morning, Mr. Cole.
E: looks up
C: BILL
D: 'Morning. Hello, Jim.
C: JIM
D: Hello, Bill.
E: turning
N: Jim turns away, reacts, suddenly turns back to Bill, taking in the pajamas and robe. A little shocked but unwilling to believe the implication of what he sees, he looks to Muriel for an explanation.
C: MURIEL
D: The bridge was roped off and Bill had to stay last night.
E: lamely
C: JIM
D: ...Oh.
C: BILL
D: Slept like a rock.
E: cheerily
C: JIM
D: I'm delighted.
N: Jim looks at Bill, then back at Muriel.
C: SIMMS
D: And then, of course, there are hot and cold water pipes hooked to the joists right under that pantry. They go up to the wing bathroom on the second floor, and I'll bet my bottom dollar he had to relocate them.
E: clearing his throat
N: THREE SHOT - JIM, MURIEL AND BILL. THREE SHOT - Jim, Muriel and Bill. Jim turns to listen but finds himself looking speculatively at Muriel and Bill.
C: SIMMS' VOICE
D: And I guess the electrician had to rip out about sixty feet of armored cable between the main panel and the junction box by the oil burner, including the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove.
N: FULL SHOT - GUSSIE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY FULL SHOT - Gussie appears in the doorway in raincoat, carrying umbrella.
C: GUSSIE
D: 'Morning, everybody. Whew! What a night!
C: JIM
D: Where have you been?
C: GUSSIE
D: Lansdale. Couldn't get back across the bridge.
C: JIM
D: You... weren't here last night?
C: GUSSIE
D: They weren't letting anybody across that bridge, Mr. Blandings. I passed the girls over at the Williams. They'll be along any minute.
E: to Muriel
N: As Jim reacts:
C: MURIEL
D: Thank you, Gussie. You'd better get breakfast started.
E: quickly
N: As Gussie exits, Muriel turns to Simms.
C: MURIEL
D: Where were we?
C: BILL
D: We were at the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove.
C: JIM
D: Just a minute. You mean the children weren't here last night either?
E: looks at Bill, then at Muriel
C: MURIEL
D: How could they be, dear? The bridge was closed.
C: JIM
D: I just came across it.
C: MURIEL
D: Well, it was closed last night.
C: JIM
D: It's open now!
E: pointedly
N: Embarrassed pause.
C: BILL
D: If you'll all excuse me -- I -- I think I'll just go up and slip into something a little more comfortable.
E: attempt at breeziness
N: Bill exits. Another pause. Simms, aware of the tension, wants to get out of there.
C: SIMMS
D: Well, that's about the size of it --
E: rapidly
N: Through Simms' speech, Jim looks darkly at Muriel.
C: SIMMS
D: -- except that Retch had to repair the pantry wall and that meant getting a plasterer back. And of course, he couldn't have broken through that wall --
C: JIM
D: All right, Simms, all right. We'll take care of it.
C: SIMMS
D: I'll admit it's a little steep. But I'll try to get Retch to knock a hundred dollars off the bill. If I can't get that, I'll certainly try for seventy-five.
E: preparing to exit
C: JIM
D: Fine.
C: SIMMS
D: If he doesn't go for seventy-five, I'll take a stab at fifty.
C: JIM
D: You do that.
C: SIMMS
D: Anyway, I'm almost sure we can get twenty-five.
E: at the door
N: There is no answer.
C: SIMMS
D: Well. Good day.
E: lamely
N: He leaves. There is a deadly pause.
C: MURIEL
D: Now dear, you're upset, you've got a lot of things on your mind --
E: carefully
C: JIM
D: Muriel, there's only one thing on my mind -- This house -- and how fast we can get rid of it!
E: with dangerous calm
C: MURIEL
D: That's not what you're thinking.
C: JIM
D: Maybe it's not. Maybe I'm thinking I was once a happy man! I didn't have a closet, I didn't have three bathrooms, but I did have my sanity, a few dollars in the bank, two children who loved me and a wife I could trust!
E: the martyr
C: MURIEL
D: That's a fine thing to say!
C: JIM
D: I also had a job at Danton and Bascomb, something I don't happen to have at the moment!
C: MURIEL
D: Jim!
C: JIM
D: That's right, I've resigned! We're starting all over again! From scratch! And without this house!
C: MURIEL
D: You love this house!
E: near tears
C: JIM
D: I hate it!
N: In the b.g. Mr. Tesander enters, cap in hand, stands there, nervous and embarrassed.
C: MURIEL
D: You don't mean that.
C: JIM
D: Every word of it! Anybody who builds a house today is crazy! The minute you start, they put you on the list. The All-American Sucker list! Everywhere you turn they've got a hand in your pocket. If you take out their hands, they find more pockets! It's a conspiracy, I tell you, a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own! Against every boy and girl who were ever in love!
E: explosively
N: Tesander clears his throat. Jim turns.
C: JIM
D: What do you want?!
E: sharply
N: A slight embarrassed pause. Then:
C: TESANDER
D: Well, Mr. Blandings, there's a matter of twelve dollars and eighty-six cents.
E: shyly
C: JIM
D: Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents! Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander? Take everything I've got! Spread it out among your pals! Wouldn't Retch like a little something? Maybe Zucca could use my new dinner jacket? It's open house, Mr. Tesander! Help yourself! If this isn't enough I'll come over to your place and do some odd chores. Maybe I can mow your lawn or scratch your back!
E: with a wild gleam emptying pockets advancing toward the bewildered Tesander
C: TESANDER
D: You don't understand, Mr. Blandings. This twelve dollars and eighty-six cents -- you don't owe me, I owe you.
E: simply
N: There is a momentary pause.
C: JIM
D: ...W-what was that?
C: TESANDER
D: Found I overcharged you. Almost three feet.
E: taking out money
N: He hands the money to Jim, who stares at it blankly.
C: TESANDER
D: Better count it. I think it's all there.
N: Jim looks haplessly at Muriel, sheepish, guilty.
C: MURIEL
D: Thank you very much, Mr. Tesander.
C: TESANDER
D: Well, I guess I'd better be gettin' along. Sure got a pretty place here. I'll tell Mr. Zucca about the dinner jacket.
E: looking around at door; pauses; looks back
N: Jim and Muriel look at each other a little sheepishly.
S: INT. THE FOYER
N: As Tesander is about to exit, Bill, dressed, starts down the stairs.
C: BILL
D: Oh, Mr. Tesander -- could you give me a lift to town?
C: TESANDER
D: Yep.
C: BILL
D: Be right with you.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
C: MURIEL
D: What did you mean before about losing your job? Will we really have to sell the house?
E: concerned
C: JIM
D: I don't know, dear... I don't know.
E: miserable
N: Bill enters.
C: BILL
D: In case anyone's interested, I'm leaving for town. If you want to count the silverware, I'll wait.
E: for Jim's benefit
C: JIM
D: Bill, be patient with me. Maybe one of these days I'll grow up.
E: sheepishly
C: BILL
D: What happened to him?
E: to Muriel
C: MURIEL
D: Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents.
C: BILL
D: Mind if I say something?
N: Jim and Muriel look at him curiously.
C: BILL
D: You know, I've kind of been the voice of doom about this whole project. Every step of the way I was firmly convinced you were getting fleeced, bilked, rooked, flimflammed and generally taken to the cleaners. And maybe you were. Maybe it cost you a whole lot more than you thought it would. Maybe there were times when you wished you'd never started the whole thing. But when I look around and see what you two have here -- I don't know. Maybe there are some things you should buy with your heart and not with your head. Maybe those are the things that really count... See you around.
E: pause
N: As Bill turns and leaves, the outer door is heard opening and the kids appear. There is an exchange of "Hi's" as they pass.
C: BETSY
D: 'Morning, everybody!
C: JOAN
D: Hi, Dad! How come you're not at the office?
E: surprised
C: JIM
D: I'm on a... kind of a vacation.
E: a look at Muriel
C: JOAN
D: You mean you got fired?
C: JIM
D: Well, not exactly, I --
C: MURIEL
D: We'll discuss it later.
N: Gussie's head appears from the kitchen.
C: GUSSIE
D: Come and get it! Breakfast everybody.
E: brightly
C: BETSY
D: Good! I'm starving! What are we having, Gussie?
C: GUSSIE
D: Orange juice, scrambled eggs and you- know-what.
C: JOAN
D: Ham?
E: making a face
C: GUSSIE
D: Not ham -- Wham! If you ain't eatin' Wham, you ain't eatin' ham!
E: cheerily
N: Gussie's head disappears. CLOSE SHOT - JIM. CLOSE SHOT - Jim.
C: JIM
D: What did she say?
N: He reacts with the sudden exhilaration of Balboa first seeing the Pacific. He snaps his fingers.
C: JIM
D: Darling, give Gussie a ten dollar raise!
N: His eyes light up as he begins to visualize.
T: DISSOLVE
N: INSERT ADVERTISEMENT IN MAGAZINE - It is a picture of Gussie, smiling, holding a platter with an enormous ham. Under it, the simple caption: "IF YOU AIN'T EATIN' WHAM, YOU AIN'T EATIN' HAM!" THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO DISCLOSE MR. JAMES BLANDINGS THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Mr. James Blandings reclining in a hammock on the patio of his Dream House. In the b.g. Muriel is working at her garden, Joan and Betsy assisting her. Jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he sets the magazine down, takes a long drink of lemonade and picks up a book which he has been reading. As the CAMERA COMES IN for an EXTREME CLOSE SHOT of Jim we see the title of the book on the jacket cover. It reads: "MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE" Jim looks up over the top of the book, directly into the camera and winks.
C: JIM
D: Drop in and see us sometime.
E: with simple sincerity
N: As the CAMERA PULLS AWAY to a LONG SHOT tableau of the Blandings and their Dream House, we:
T: FADE OUT
N: THE END
