S: EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY
N: We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM into a window.
S: INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
N: A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and Freud line the shelves. A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front of her looking impatient. The therapist continues to write notes.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I know.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I know.
N: Sebastian takes out a cigarette.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: There's no smoking in my office.
E: not looking up
N: Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr. Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking her head.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What do you want me to say? That I'm supposed to feel remorse because I act the way I do? The truth is I don't.
N: Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Look, I'm not like all the other kids in high school. I don't care about book reports and extra-credit. Teachers are idiots anyway. The only challenge out there for me is women. You see a girl you like. You pursue them. You conquer. You move on. It's exciting.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: But you said you have the worst reputation.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I do.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Don't you want to change that?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: I think that's all the time we have for today.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Same time next week?
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: No. This is going to be our last session.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
N: Sebastian picks up a book of Freud. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) He was a coke addict, you know.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It works a little.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: No it doesn't. I see right through you.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You do?
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
N: Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: My daughter, Rachel.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yummy.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Really? Care to make a wager on that?
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Good luck, Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What, nervous I'm going to win?
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Would you please leave.
N: Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves. DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd) Asshole. The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials. DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd) Rachel, it's mom.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk, crying while holding the phone.
C: RACHEL
D: Hi, mom.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Honey, is something wrong?
N: Rachel cries for a moment.
C: RACHEL
D: He told me he loved me and I believed him.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Who told you?
C: RACHEL
D: You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
N: She continues to cry.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
C: RACHEL
D: Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
N: WE PAN OVER TO HER COMPUTER CONSOLE. CLOSE ON: COMPUTER MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her privates.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: What kind of pictures?
C: RACHEL
D: Nudie pictures, what do you think?
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
C: RACHEL
D: I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there. Mom? Are you there? Mom? Mother!!!!
E: she hears the phone drop screaming
S: INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots Sebastian standing in the elevator.
C: DR. GREENBAUM
D: You son of a bitch.
N: Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her expressionless as the elevator doors close. DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd) You're gonna pay for this you little shit. You hear me. A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum. DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd) Fuck off, Harold. He gasps.
S: EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY
N: A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the steps to the townhouse.
C: METER MAID
D: You can't park there.
N: Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering the townhouse.
S: INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
N: A SERIES OF SHOTS CLOSE ON: A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher knife comes down on the tuna cutting it's head off. CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish. CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice roll.
S: INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi through several doors until we enter the final door leading into -
S: INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel. SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi in front of - KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her face and listens attentively as - BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt with a Koala Bear on it.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
C: KATHRYN
D: I'll do my best.
N: Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn. KATHRYN (cont'd) (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese) Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be all. Sook-Hee leaves.
C: CECILE
D: What was that?
C: KATHRYN
D: I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
N: MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd) Kathryn is a straight A student at Oakwood as well as being President of the French Club. Listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far.
C: KATHRYN
D: You're too kind.
E: in French
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
C: KATHRYN
D: I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure,
C: I...
D: turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
E: takes out her crucifix
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: That's beautiful.
C: CECILE
D: What are the boys like?
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Cecile, is that the best you can do? You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
E: to Kathryn
C: KATHRYN
D: Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I hear she's recovering quite well.
E: O.S.
N: Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the doorway. He walks over and takes a seat. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: You remember my daughter, Cecile.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: My, what an adorable shirt you're wearing.
C: CECILE
D: My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
C: KATHRYN
D: Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Outstanding.
C: CECILE
D: What year are you in?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
C: CECILE
D: But I thought high school is only four years.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
N: He winks at Cecile.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: I think we'll be going now. Thanks for all your help.
E: to Kathryn
N: Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile.
C: KATHRYN
D: I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
C: CECILE
D: Thanks. Nice meeting you.
E: to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ciao.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Let's go, Cecile. Now!
N: Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn closes the door behind them.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
C: KATHRYN
D: I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
N: Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the bottom part a small vial of coke. KATHRYN (cont'd) The parental units called while you were out.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
C: KATHRYN
D: Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
N: Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a bump. KATHRYN (cont'd) What's wrong with you today? Therapy not going well?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It was fine.
N: He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid Manhattan Debutantes. He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Nothing shocks them anymore. He scratches the nude's pubic area. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my touch. He kisses it.
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What?
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears a Polo sweater with an American Flag.
C: KATHRYN
D: You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret Reynolds?
E: V.O.
N: Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes up her hair.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth Of July Weekend?
E: V.O.
S: INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.
C: KATHRYN
D: He didn't dump me. We had a parting of the ways.
N: Sebastian stares her down. KATHRYN (cont'd) Alright he dumped me. He smiles, then swallows the sushi.
S: EXT. PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE/INT. COURT' S CAR - NIGHT
N: A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.
C: KATMRYN
D: I went to great lengths to please Court. Huge sacrifices were made on my part to keep him happy.
E: V.O.
N: Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Swallow?
E: V.O.
N: She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.
C: KATHRYN
D: What do you think?
E: V.O.
N: Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sorry.
E: V.O.
S: INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
C: KATHRYN
D: In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You don't mean?
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.
C: KATHRYN
D: None other than Cecile Caldwell.
E: V.O.
N: She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone. She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet
S: INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Sebastian snickers.
C: KATHRYN
D: I don't find this very funny,
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
E: imitating Kathryn
C: KATHRYN
D: Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
C: KATHRYN
D: Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I see your point... though why should I care?
C: KATHRYN
D: I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sounds intriguing.
C: KATHRYN
D: She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
N: Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his lips. KATHRYN (cont'd) Be her Captain Picard, Valmont. Boldly go where no man has gone before. Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I can't.
N: Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.
C: KATHRYN
D: Why not?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
N: He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."
C: KATHRYN
D: I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Shut up and turn to page 64.
N: She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas City, Missouri.
C: KATHRYN
D: Jesus Christ, is she for real?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
C: KATHRYN
D: B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
C: KATHRYN
D: You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Care to make a wager on that?
C: KATHRYN
D: I'll think about it...
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
N: He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Could you be more desperate to read it?
N: Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh Sebastian. About that little wager of yours.
N: He stops. KATHRYN (cont'd) Count me in.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What are the terms?
C: KATHRYN
D: If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: And if I win?
N: She approaches him.
C: KATHRYN
D: I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Be more specific.
C: KATHRYN
D: In English. I'll fuck your brains out.
E: whispers in his ear
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
C: KATHRYN
D: Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
N: Sebastian sneers at her. KATHRYN (cont'd) Do we have a deal?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No way, that car means everything to me.
N: She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.
C: KATHRYN
D: You can put it anywhere.
E: whispering
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Even there?
C: KATHRYN
D: It would feel so yummy.
E: baby talk
N: Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand. KATHRYN (cont'd) Happy hunting.
S: EXT. ROSEMOND ESTATE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY
N: WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE. Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.
S: EXT. ESTATE - MEADOW - DAY
N: ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt. The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl. The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.
C: ANNETTE
D: It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
C: ANNETTE
D: My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: I'm sorry about that.
C: ANNETTE
D: My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
C: ANNETTE
D: Ben Schwarz.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Schwarz. Jewish?
C: ANNETTE
D: German.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Doesn't ring a bell.
N: Annette throws her a concerned look. AUNT HELEN (cont'd) In any event, I want you to consider this your home for the time being.
C: ANNETTE
D: Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet around here.
N: BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance. ANNETTE (cont'd) What was that?
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Sebastian must be here.
N: Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.
S: EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY
N: Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper, FRANKLIN stands by the trap.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Pull!
N: The TARGET soars into the air, SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Die motherfucker! He fires the gun, missing the target. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Shit, shit, shit. Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian perks up. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Kitty. Kitty. He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW again. Sebastian searches for the cat. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss. He raises his rifle and takes aim.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Sebastian!
E: O.S.
N: He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and Annette riding over to him. He waves. Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I've been looking all over for you. God, I've missed you.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: I've missed you too. How are your parents?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: They're coming back next week. I write them everyday.
N: She strokes his cheek, lovingly.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison. She's going to be staying with me for a few weeks.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.
N: He extends his hand and they shake. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) (to Aunt Helen) Why don't you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours? We'll take care of the horses.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Anything for you, my dear.
N: Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse. AUNT HELEN (cont'd) Stay out of trouble you two. SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE We will. He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.
S: INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY
N: Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: So what year are you going into?
C: ANNETTE
D: Junior.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Got a boyfriend back home?
C: ANNETTE
D: No.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why not?
C: ANNETTE
D: I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You a lesbo?
C: ANNETTE
D: No.
E: annoyed
N: She bends over to pick up the saddle.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Nice.
N: She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.
C: ANNETTE
D: Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
N: She shakes her head and continues with her chore.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I read your teen beat manifesto.
C: ANNETTE
D: You did?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I must say I found it rather appalling.
C: ANNETTE
D: That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
C: ANNETTE
D: I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh really?
C: ANNETTE
D: Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: How do you know I've been with several women?
C: ANNETTE
D: A friend wrote me.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
E: pissed
C: ANNETTE
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
N: An uncomfortable silence falls between them,
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
C: ANNETTE
D: It's not really important.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
C: ANNETTE
D: Why are you being so dramatic?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
C: ANNETTE
D: Alright, I said I was sorry. Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
E: beat
N: She approaches him and they shake. ANNETTE (cont'd) Annette Harrison.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sebastian Valmont.
N: She smiles, but before he releases her hand: SEBASTIAN (cont'd) So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since you've never had sex do you touch yourself? She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What did I say?
S: INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.
C: RONALD
D: That's good, that's good.
E: O.S.
N: WE PULL BACK Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a music lesson. RONALD (cont'd) Now let's try the A minor scale. Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly. Kathryn enters and shudders in silence. RONALD (cont'd) Once more, and remember the third note is flat. Cecile tries again and once again screws up.
C: CECILE
D: Oh, I suck. I suck.
C: RONALD
D: Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
N: Cecile takes a deep breath RONALD (cont'd) You're concentrating too much on your bowing. Let it flow. He stands and sits behind her. RONALD (cont'd) Here, let me help you. He places his hand over hers. RONALD (cont'd) Now close your eyes and let's try again. She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's face. It's obvious he's smitten with her. ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses her face. Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual. ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground. Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray
C: KATHRYN
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Your playing was beautiful.
N: Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile
C: CECILE
D: Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's giving me music lessons over the summer.

C: RONALD
D: It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
C: CECILE
D: Doctor King is my favorite.
N: Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.
C: RONALD
D: I guess our hour's up. Same time tomorrow?
N: Cecile nods.

S: INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
N: A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art. BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds from his stash. Sebastian paces behind him.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
C: BLAINE
D: - none taken -
C: SEBASTIAN
D: - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
C: BLAINE
D: Any ideas who it could be?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
C: BLAINE
D: Where did you say she's from?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
C: BLAINE
D: Greg McConnell.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: The football stud?
C: BLAINE
D: He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
C: BLAINE
D: I don't think that bothered him.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What do you mean?
C: BLAINE
D: Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Are you shitting me?
C: BLAINE
D: I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything." It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
E: imitating Greg beat
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
C: BLAINE
D: Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
C: BLAINE
D: Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Outstanding.
C: BLAINE
D: Don't think it's not going to cost you.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
N: Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
N: Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind Cecile and braids her hair.
C: KATHRYN
D: So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
C: CECILE
D: He's alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
E: giggles
C: KATHRYN
D: Really? Bulimic headcase.
C: CECILE
D: What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
E: beat
C: KATHRYN
D: That's great.
C: CECILE
D: You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
C: KATHRYN
D: What are you scared of?
C: CECILE
D: Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
C: KATHRYN
D: Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
C: CECILE
D: Eww. No. That's gross.
C: KATHRYN
D: It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
N: Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses. KATHRYN (cont'd) Now close your eyes and wet your lips.
C: CECILE
D: Are you for real?
C: KATHRYN
D: Do you want to learn or not?
C: CECILE
D: I guess. It still sounds gross.
N: Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses her on the mouth.
C: KATHRYN
D: See that wasn't so bad.
C: CECILE
D: It was nothing.
C: KATHRYN
D: Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
C: CECILE
D: Okay.
E: reluctant
C: KATHRYN
D: Eyes closed.
N: Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does as instructed and they start to make out. Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and continues her seduction. She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh. Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other and smile. KATHRYN (cont'd) Not bad.
C: CECILE
D: That was cool.
C: KATHRYN
D: Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
C: CECILE
D: What are you saying?
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
C: CECILE
D: Is it that obvious?
N: Kathryn nods. CECILE (cont'd) He sends me letters you know. Love letters.
C: KATHRYN
D: That's so romantic. Have you responded?
C: CECILE
D: No.
C: KATHRYN
D: Well do you like him?
C: CECILE
D: I don't know.
C: KATHRYN
D: Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
C: CECILE
D: I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
E: beat
N: Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her. CECILE (cont'd) What am I going to do? If my mother found out about Ronald she would kill me. Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.
C: KATHRYN
D: Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
C: CECILE
D: Okay.
C: KATHRYN
D: Did you hide the letters?
C: CECILE
D: Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
C: KATHRYN
D: I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
C: CECILE
D: Why?
C: KATHRYN
D: Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
C: CECILE
D: You'd do that for me?
C: KATHRYN
D: Of course I would. We're friends, right?
C: CECILE
D: Best friends.
N: Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

C: SEBASTIAN
D: Great book.
C: ANNETTE
D: You've read The Fountainhead?
E: skeptical
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
C: ANNETTE
D: Romantic? He rapes her.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: That's a matter of opinion.
C: ANNETTE
D: You need help.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
C: ANNETTE
D: At this hour? I don't think so.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
C: ANNETTE
D: Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Please.

D: You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
E: holding out the letter
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What? Another letter from your friend?
C: ANNETTE
D: This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
E: reading the letter
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
C: ANNETTE
D: I sincerely doubt it.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Give me the fucking letter.
N: Annette smiles and tears the letter up. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Why did you do that?
C: ANNETTE
D: The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
E: mocking
N: She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece bathing suit underneath.
C: ANNETTE
D: How's the water?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Refreshing.
N: She dives in the pool and surfaces. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) You're right you know.
C: ANNETTE
D: About what?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
C: ANNETTE
D: I never said that.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You implied it.
C: ANNETTE
D: Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
C: ANNETTE
D: Thank you.
E: caught off guard
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
E: counts with his fingers
C: ANNETTE
D: Shut up.
E: jokingly
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
C: ANNETTE
D: Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why not?
C: ANNETTE
D: Because you act like a pig.
N: He swims towards her.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
C: ANNETTE
D: I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
N: He flexes for her. She laughs.
C: ANNETTE
D: I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
N: He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.
C: ANNETTE
D: You're naked.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It's my house.
N: She pushes him off her.
C: ANNETTE
D: That's repulsive.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
N: Annette climbs out of the pool.
C: ANNETTE
D: Get some manners.
N: She walks into the house.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.
N: She flips him the bird as she heads into the house. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail Mary's for you. (beat) Good night.

C: GREG
D: Get out of here.
E: from under the covers
N: Sebastian stands YANKS the covers off the bed, revealing Greg and Blaine.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Whoa!
C: GREG
D: I told you to lock the door.
C: BLAINE
D: I thought I did.
C: GREG
D: Look Valmont. This was the first time I've ever done something like this. I was --
C: SEBASTIAN
D: -- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
E: apathetic
C: GREG
D: Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
C: BLAINE
D: Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer.
C: GREG
D: Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything. Let's just forget the whole thing.
E: to Sebastian
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you there. It's too good to pass up.
N: Greg starts to cry. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) After all, it is you who's bad- mouthing me to Annette Harrison.
C: GREG
D: Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
C: GREG
D: I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
E: sobbing
C: BLAINE
D: I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
N: Greg wipes his eyes. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) However, this whole incident's kind of turned me on. Sebastian unzips his fly. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) You get my point. Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles. Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when - SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Jesus Christ, I was only kidding. What do you think, I'm gay? My God, haven't you had enough for tonight.
C: BLAINE
D: Our boy just can't get enough dick.
C: GREG
D: You sick son of a bitch.
N: Blaine and Sebastian laugh.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I'll leave you guys alone. Score one for the team, Greg.
E: macho voice
N: Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Come to think of it, there is something you can do for me.
S: EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY
N: Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and lands on the road. Sebastian is driving. Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to her.

D: How are you today?
C: ANNETTE
D: Give it up.

D: I said I was sorry.
N: She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Have a nice sleep last night?
C: ANNETTE
D: It was fine.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
C: ANNETTE
D: I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
N: Annette stops running and turns to him.
C: ANNETTE
D: And that's a bad thing?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
C: ANNETTE
D: I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
C: ANNETTE
D: You don't even know me.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Don't you believe in love at first sight?
C: ANNETTE
D: Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?

C: SEBASTIAN
D: Who?
C: ANNETTE

C: SEBASTIAN
D: How about tonight?
C: ANNETTE
D: I'm busy.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Doing what?
C: ANNETTE
D: That's also none of your business.

D: Yes.

C: SEBASTIAN
D: I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

D: What do you mean?
C: GREG
D: Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
C: ANNETTE
D: I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
E: sighs
C: GREG
D: From who?

C: GREG
D: Annette, how long have we known each other?

C: SALESWOMAN
D: Here's something you might like.
N: Kathryn examines the label.
C: KATHRYN

C: SALESWOMAN
D: No. All our fur is faux.
C: KATHRYN
D: Of course. The animals. How silly of me.
N: The saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers then looks over at a small child, staring at her. KATHRYN (cont'd) (mouthing the words) Fuck off. She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell approaches.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: I got your message and came as quick as I could.
C: KATHRYN
D: I hope I didn't keep you from something.
C: MRS. CALDWELL

C: KATHRYN
D: It's Cecile.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: What about her?
C: KATHRYN
D: Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
C: KATHRYN
D: It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Ronald? That's crazy.
C: KATHRYN
D: I know. She's so young and he's so -
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Black.
N: Kathryn reacts to her remark.

N: Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales counter. KATHRYN (cont'd) I hope I did the right thing in telling you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things with Court.

C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Absolutely.

C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Who the hell do you think you are?!
C: RONALD
D: Excuse me.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
C: RONALD
D: Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Is that so?
N: Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters. MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd) You care to explain this then? Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry.

C: RONALD
D: Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
N: Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs. Caldwell waits.
C: RONALD
D: First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
C: MRS. CALDWELL
D: Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
C: RONALD
D: I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.

D: She really loves me.
E: eyes tear up
N: Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes. RONALD (cont'd) What do I do?
C: KATHRYN
D: What do you do? Tell her you love her.
C: RONALD
D: But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
C: RONALD
D: How will I get to her?
N: SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN We'll make sure she gets it.
C: RONALD
D: Why are you being so good to me?
C: KATHRYN
D: Because we want to see Cecile happy and we know you make her happy.
N: She hands Ronald a pen and paper. KATHRYN (cont'd) Now you just march yourself into the study and start writing. We'll be there to check on you in a minute. Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while Kathryn picks up the phone and dials.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Who are you calling?
C: KATHRYN
D: Cecile.
N: Sebastian hangs up the phone. KATHRYN (cont'd) What are you doing?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
C: KATHRYN
D: I'm aware.
N: She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
C: KATHRYN
D: What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
N: She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on it. KATHRYN (cont'd) Court Renolds is going down and if you're not going to help me, someone else will.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You amaze me.
C: KATHRYN
D: Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day." I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
E: beat
N: Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and dials. KATHRYN (cont'd) Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright, stop crying. I understand. Hold on for Sebastian. She hands the phone to Sebastian.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me very carefully. I have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to you. Now I can't exactly bring it to your house, since your mother despises me so here's what we're going to do.

D: My mom? Don't call my mom.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
N: Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms around his legs.
C: CECILE
D: Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
C: CECILE
D: And then I can go home?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Of course. I'm not a monster.
N: Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her feet.
C: CECILE
D: Just a kiss, right?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I swear.
N: She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the string holding up her sweats and pulls it open. Cecile bolts up.
C: CECILE
D: What are you doing?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You promised to let me kiss you.
C: CECILE
D: But -
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
E: pointing at her lips

C: CECILE
D: I don't love him. I love Ronald.
C: KATHRYN

D: That's not fair.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Why can't we be together?
N: Annette's eyes well up with tears.
C: ANNETTE
D: You really want to know?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Yes.

C: ANNETTE
D: How am I a hypocrite?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.

C: KATHRYN
D: You didn't?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh yes.
C: KATHRYN
D: Tell me all the details.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It was... Fantastic.
C: KATHRYN
D: Oh come on. For her first time?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
C: KATHRYN
D: No, tell me.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
C: KATHRYN
D: Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.

C: SEBASTIAN
D: What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
N: Kathryn starts to cry.
C: KATHRYN
D: I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
C: KATHRYN
D: At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
C: KATHRYN
D: Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
C: KATHRYN
D: Is that what you think?
N: He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it aside, spreading her legs. KATHRYN (cont'd) Alright, come on, let's get it over with. But mark my words, this is the only time it'll happen. She picks up the phone. KATHRYN (cont'd) Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in me. While you're doing that I'm gonna make some phone calls.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
C: KATHRYN
D: Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
N: Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought. KATHRYN (cont'd) Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but now he's just another love-struck faggot. One of the many.

D: I've never done this before.
C: KATHRYN
D: How have you dumped girls in the past?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Screening calls. Any suggestions?
C: KATHRYN
D: I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." Poor fatty never had a chance.

N: Annette bursts into tears.
C: ANNETTE
D: Why are you trying to hurt me?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
N: She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off. He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with his hand. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea would appreciate you acting like a total psychopath. She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.
C: ANNETTE
D: You don't know how to love.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
C: ANNETTE
D: But you knew this was important to me.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: What, your virginity? Well that's over now.

C: KATHRYN
D: Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: You wanted an answer to your question.
C: KATHRYN
D: Annette?
N: He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been crying.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
C: KATHRYN
D: Well done.
N: He holds up a bottle of champagne.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I thought we should celebrate.
C: KATHRYN
D: I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Ronald?
C: KATHRYN
D: Not that it's any of your business but yes.
N: Sebastian holds up a letter.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: From Ronald.
N: Kathryn takes the letter. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I haven't had a chance to read it, but I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me. Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." You see, I expected your sort of bullshit so I took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile over you, but I promised him I would see you through your crisis.
C: KATHRYN
D: Well done.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Thank you. Now, where were we?
N: POP goes the champagne cork. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Oh yeah, the celebration. He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them and hands one to Kathryn. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What shall we toast to?
C: KATHRYN
D: To my triumph, of course.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
N: Kathryn giggles. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What's so funny?
C: KATHRYN
D: Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Come again?
C: KATHRYN
D: You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Cheers.
E: smiles
N: She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't drink. He looks ill.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: In any event, you still owe me my reward.
C: KATHRYN
D: I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
N: Sebastian slaps her across the face. KATHRYN (cont'd) You motherfucker! She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They fall to the ground. KATHRYN (cont'd) Nobody hits me.

C: KATHRYN
D: Get off me!
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Will you calm down?
C: KATHRYN
D: Fine! Get off me!
N: He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their breaths.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
C: KATHRYN
D: I accept. Now get out.
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Get out? We had an arrangement.
C: KATHRYN
D: Didn't you hear what I said?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
C: KATHRYN
D: Get out!
E: screaming
C: SEBASTIAN
D: I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
C: KATHRYN
D: And if I don't?
C: SEBASTIAN
D: Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
C: KATHRYN
