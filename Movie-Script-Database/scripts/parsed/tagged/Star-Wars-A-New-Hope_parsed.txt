M: A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
N: A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity. It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY
N: An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2- D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design. Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
C: THREEPIO
D: Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
N: Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
C: THREEPIO
D: We're doomed!
N: The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.
C: THREEPIO
D: There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
N: Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
C: THREEPIO
D: What's that?
S: EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
N: The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
N: The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor. In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces. An explosion hits near the robots.
C: THREEPIO
D: I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
N: Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY
N: A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile. A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow him.
C: LUKE
D: Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
N: The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY
N: The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
N: A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome. Artoo makes beeping sounds.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
N: Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.
C: THREEPIO
D: Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
N: A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.
C: THREEPIO
D: At last! Where have you been?
N: Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
C: THREEPIO
D: They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
N: Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. Threepio chases after him.
C: THREEPIO
D: Wait a minute, where are you going?
N: Artoo responds with electronic beeps.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR
N: The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
C: IMPERIAL OFFICER
D: The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
N: Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain.
C: VADER
D: Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
N: Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
C: VADER
D: What have you done with those plans?
C: REBEL OFFICER
D: We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
C: VADER
D: If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador?
N: The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.
C: VADER
D: Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
N: The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY
N: The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers spots her.
C: TROOPER
D: There she is! Set for stun!
N: Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.
C: TROOPER
D: She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY
N: Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four-man pod.
C: THREEPIO
D: Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..
N: Artoo beeps something to him.
C: THREEPIO
D: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
N: Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.
C: THREEPIO
D: Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
N: Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily. A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.
C: THREEPIO
D: I'm going to regret this.
S: INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER
N: On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
C: CHIEF PILOT
D: There goes another one.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short- circuited.
S: INT. LIFEPOD
N: Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
C: THREEPIO
D: That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
N: Artoo beeps an assuring response.
C: THREEPIO
D: Are you sure this things safe?
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
N: Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.
C: WOMAN
D: I've told you kids to slow down!
S: INT. POWER STATION - DAY
N: Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly.
C: FIXER
D: Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
C: CAMIE
D: It was just wormie on another rampage.
N: Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
C: LUKE
D: Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
N: Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
C: LUKE
D: I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
C: BIGGS
D: Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
E: he laughs
C: LUKE
D: The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
N: Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
C: BIGGS
D: Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... ...I just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
E: he salutes
N: Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it.
C: LUKE
D: I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!
C: DEAK
D: Not again! Forget it.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION -
N: DAY The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
C: LUKE
D: There they are!
N: Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.
C: BIGGS
D: That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
C: LUKE
D: But there was a lot of firing earlier...
N: Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process. Luke grabs them.
C: LUKE
D: Hey, easy with those...
C: CAMIE
D: Don't worry about it, Wormie.
N: The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
C: FIXER
D: I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
N: Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude.
S: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY
N: Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
C: LEIA
D: Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
C: VADER
D: Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
C: LEIA
D: I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
C: VADER
D: You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!
N: Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander turns to Vader.
C: COMMANDER
D: Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
C: VADER
D: I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
C: COMMANDER
D: She'll die before she tells you anything.
C: VADER
D: Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
N: Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. They stop and snap to attention.
C: SECOND OFFICER
D: Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
N: Vader turns to the Commander.
C: VADER
D: She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time.
C: COMMANDER
D: Yes, sir.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT
N: Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.
C: THREEPIO
D: How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
N: Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
C: THREEPIO
D: I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
N: Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
C: THREEPIO
D: What a desolate place this is.
N: Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio stops and yells at him.
C: THREEPIO
D: Where are you going?
N: A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot.
C: THREEPIO
D: Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.
N: Artoo counters with a long whistle.
C: THREEPIO
D: What makes you think there are settlements over there?
N: Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
C: THREEPIO
D: Don't get technical with me.
N: Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
C: THREEPIO
D: What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
N: Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.
C: THREEPIO
D: And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
N: Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.
C: THREEPIO
D: No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
N: Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA
N: Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles. He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas.
C: THREEPIO
D: That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
N: In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him.
C: THREEPIO
D: Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!
N: The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport.
C: THREEPIO
D: Over here! Help! Please, help!
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
N: Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and the others can be heard working inside.
C: LUKE
D: ...so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic.
E: Very animated
C: BIGGS
D: You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
C: LUKE
D: Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
C: BIGGS
D: I've missed you kid.
C: LUKE
D: Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet.
N: Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
C: BIGGS
D: Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
N: Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.
C: LUKE
D: What are you talking about?
C: BIGGS
D: I made some friends at the Academy. ...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
E: he whispers
N: Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
C: LUKE
D: Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
C: BIGGS
D: Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
C: LUKE
D: I'm sorry. I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me...
E: he whispers
N: Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
C: BIGGS
D: My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
C: LUKE
D: You're crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.
C: BIGGS
D: I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in.
C: LUKE
D: And I'm stuck here...
C: BIGGS
D: I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
C: LUKE
D: Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
C: BIGGS
D: Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
C: LUKE
D: I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
C: BIGGS
D: I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
C: LUKE
D: It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock.
C: BIGGS
D: Things always change.
C: LUKE
D: I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?
C: BIGGS
D: No, I'm leaving in the morning...
C: LUKE
D: Then I guess I won't see you.
C: BIGGS
D: Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
C: LUKE
D: Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
C: BIGGS
D: So long, Luke.
N: Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET
N: The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way. In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path. The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
N: The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine. The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
S: INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA
N: It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber.
S: INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA
N: Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.
C: THREEPIO
D: Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
N: A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
N: The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY
N: Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half- buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.
C: FIRST TROOPER
D: Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
N: A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper.
C: SECOND TROOPER
D: Look, sir -- droids.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES
N: The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.
S: INT. SANDCRAWLER
N: Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
C: THREEPIO
D: Wake up! Wake up!
N: Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots.
C: THREEPIO
D: We're doomed.
N: A Jawa starts moving toward them.
C: THREEPIO
D: Do you think they'll melt us down?
N: Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
C: THREEPIO
D: Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?
S: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON
N: The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house. The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language. A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.
C: BERU
D: Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
C: LUKE
D: It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
N: Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader.
C: OWEN
D: I have no need for a protocol droid.
C: THREEPIO
D: Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
E: quickly
C: OWEN
D: What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
C: THREEPIO
D: Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
C: OWEN
D: Do you speak Bocce?
C: THREEPIO
D: Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce...
C: OWEN
D: All right shut up! I'll take this one.
E: turning to Jawa
C: THREEPIO
D: Shutting up, sir.
C: OWEN
D: Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
C: LUKE
D: But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
C: OWEN
D: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!
C: LUKE
D: All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.
N: As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box. Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.
C: LUKE
D: Uncle Owen...
C: OWEN
D: Yeah?
C: LUKE
D: This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
C: OWEN
D: Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
E: to the head Jawa
N: The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder.
C: THREEPIO
D: Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
E: pointing to Artoo
C: LUKE
D: Uncle Owen...
C: OWEN
D: Yeah?
C: LUKE
D: What about that one?
C: OWEN
D: What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
E: to Jawa
N: With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo.
C: LUKE
D: Yeah, take it away.
C: THREEPIO
D: Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.
N: Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
C: LUKE
D: Okay, let's go.
C: THREEPIO
D: Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
E: to Artoo
S: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
C: THREEPIO
D: Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
N: Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.
C: LUKE
D: It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
C: THREEPIO
D: Is there anything I might do to help?
N: Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
C: LUKE
D: Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
C: THREEPIO
D: I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
C: LUKE
D: Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
C: THREEPIO
D: I see, sir.
C: LUKE
D: Uh, you can call me Luke.
C: THREEPIO
D: I see, sir Luke.
C: LUKE
D: Just Luke.
E: laughing
C: THREEPIO
D: And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
C: LUKE
D: Hello.
N: Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body.
C: LUKE
D: You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
C: THREEPIO
D: With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
C: LUKE
D: You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
C: THREEPIO
D: That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
C: LUKE
D: Have you been in many battles?
C: THREEPIO
D: Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
N: Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
C: LUKE
D: Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...
N: The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three- dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
C: LEIA
D: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
C: LUKE
D: What's this?
N: Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
C: THREEPIO
D: What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that?
E: pointing to Leia
N: Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
C: LEIA
D: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
C: THREEPIO
D: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
N: Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
C: LUKE
D: Who is she? She's beautiful.
C: THREEPIO
D: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
C: LEIA
D: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
C: THREEPIO
D: I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...
C: LUKE
D: Is there more to this recording?
N: Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
C: THREEPIO
D: Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
N: Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
C: THREEPIO
D: He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
C: LUKE
D: Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
C: THREEPIO
D: I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
C: LUKE
D: Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
N: Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments.
C: LUKE
D: I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
N: Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
C: THREEPIO
D: He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
N: Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
C: LUKE
D: H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
N: Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side.
C: LUKE
D: There you go.
N: The princess immediately disappears...
C: LUKE
D: Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
N: Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment.
C: THREEPIO
D: What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
N: A women's voice calls out from another room.
C: AUNT BERU
D: Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
N: Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot.
C: LUKE
D: All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
C: THREEPIO
D: I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
N: Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room.
C: LUKE
D: Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.
C: THREEPIO
D: Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
E: to Artoo
N: Artoo beeps in response.
C: THREEPIO
D: No, I don't think he likes you at all.
N: Artoo beeps.
C: THREEPIO
D: No, I don't like you either.
S: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA
N: Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well- used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area. Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain.
C: LUKE
D: You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
C: OWEN
D: What makes you think that?
C: LUKE
D: Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
N: Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself.
C: LUKE
D: I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
N: Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
C: OWEN
D: That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
C: LUKE
D: But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
C: OWEN
D: He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
C: LUKE
D: He knew my father?
C: OWEN
D: I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
C: LUKE
D: Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
N: Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it.
C: OWEN
D: You mean the next semester before harvest?
C: LUKE
D: Sure, there're more than enough droids.
C: OWEN
D: Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.
N: Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.
C: OWEN
D: You must understand I need you here, Luke.
C: LUKE
D: But it's a whole 'nother year.
C: OWEN
D: Look, it's only one more season.
N: Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
C: LUKE
D: Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
C: AUNT BERU
D: Where are you going?
C: LUKE
D: It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
N: Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen mechanically finishes his dinner.
C: AUNT BERU
D: Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.
C: OWEN
D: I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
C: AUNT BERU
D: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
C: OWEN
D: That's what I'm afraid of.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
N: The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead.
S: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE
N: Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
C: LUKE
D: What are you doing hiding there?
N: Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight.
C: THREEPIO
D: It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
C: LUKE
D: Oh, no!
N: Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
N: Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
C: THREEPIO
D: That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.
C: LUKE
D: How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!
C: THREEPIO
D: Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
C: LUKE
D: It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning.
N: Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
C: OWEN
D: Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
C: LUKE
D: All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.
N: He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
C: LUKE
D: You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
C: THREEPIO
D: Oh, he excels at that, sir.
S: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA
N: Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.
C: OWEN
D: Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!
S: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN
N: The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.
C: OWEN
D: Have you seen Luke this morning?
C: AUNT BERU
D: He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
C: OWEN
D: Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?
C: AUNT BERU
D: I think so.
C: OWEN
D: Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!
S: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY
N: The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland.
S: INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -
N: DAY Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment.
C: LUKE
D: How's that.
E: yelling
N: Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
C: LUKE
D: Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
C: THREEPIO
D: Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
C: LUKE
D: Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
E: brightening
C: THREEPIO
D: Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
C: LUKE
D: Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY
N: From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired. The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON
N: The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR
N: The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo.
C: LUKE
D: Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
N: The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway.
C: THREEPIO
D: Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
C: LUKE
D: Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
C: THREEPIO
D: If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
C: LUKE
D: No, he's not going to try anything.
N: Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams.
C: LUKE
D: What's wrong with him now?
C: THREEPIO
D: Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
N: Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
C: LUKE
D: Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY
N: Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer.
C: LUKE
D: There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.
N: Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain. The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY
N: Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror. Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.
C: BEN
D: Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.
N: Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.
C: BEN
D: Don't worry, he'll be all right.
C: LUKE
D: What happened?
C: BEN
D: Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
C: LUKE
D: Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
C: BEN
D: The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
C: LUKE
D: Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
N: Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.
C: BEN
D: Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
C: LUKE
D: I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
C: BEN
D: Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.
C: LUKE
D: You know him!
C: BEN
D: Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
C: LUKE
D: Then the droid does belong to you.
C: BEN
D: Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...
N: He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
C: BEN
D: I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
N: Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.
C: LUKE
D: Threepio!
S: EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY
N: Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off. Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.
C: THREEPIO
D: Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
C: LUKE
D: Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
C: THREEPIO
D: I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
N: Artoo makes a beeping sound.
C: LUKE
D: No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?
N: Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.
C: BEN
D: Quickly, son... they're on the move.
S: INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING
N: The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as old Ben sits thinking.
C: LUKE
D: No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
C: BEN
D: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
C: LUKE
D: You fought in the Clone Wars?
C: BEN
D: Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
C: LUKE
D: I wish I'd known him.
C: BEN
D: He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...
N: Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously. Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it.
C: BEN
D: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
C: THREEPIO
D: Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
C: LUKE
D: Sure, go ahead.
N: Ben hands Luke the saber.
C: LUKE
D: What is it?
C: BEN
D: Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
N: Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the ceiling.
C: BEN
D: An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.
N: Luke hasn't really been listening.
C: LUKE
D: How did my father die?
C: BEN
D: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
C: LUKE
D: The Force?
C: BEN
D: Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
N: Artoo makes beeping sounds.
C: BEN
D: Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.
C: LUKE
D: I saw part of the message he was...
N: Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.
C: BEN
D: I seem to have found it.
N: Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes.
C: LEIA
D: General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
N: There is a little static and the transmission is cut short. Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.
C: BEN
D: You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
C: LUKE
D: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
E: laughing
C: BEN
D: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
C: LUKE
D: I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
C: BEN
D: That's your uncle talking.
C: LUKE
D: Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
E: sighing
C: BEN
D: Learn about the Force, Luke.
C: LUKE
D: Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
C: BEN
D: You must do what you feel is right, of course.
S: EXT. SPACE.
N: An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
N: Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking.
C: TAGGE
D: Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.
N: The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
C: MOTTI
D: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
C: TAGGE
D: The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
N: Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him.
C: TARKIN
D: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
C: TAGGE
D: That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
C: TARKIN
D: The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
C: TAGGE
D: And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
C: VADER
D: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
C: MOTTI
D: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!
C: VADER
D: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
C: MOTTI
D: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
N: Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's spell.
C: VADER
D: I find your lack of faith disturbing.
C: TARKIN
D: Enough of this! Vader, release him!
C: VADER
D: As you wish.
C: TARKIN
D: This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
N: The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies.
C: LUKE
D: It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
N: Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
C: BEN
D: They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
C: LUKE
D: These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
C: BEN
D: And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
C: LUKE
D: Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
N: Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.
C: LUKE
D: If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!
N: Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it.
C: BEN
D: Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.
N: Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
N: Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
N: The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place.
C: LUKE
D: Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
N: Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR
N: Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.
C: VADER
D: And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
N: The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
N: There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead. Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him.
C: BEN
D: There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.
C: LUKE
D: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
N: The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing.
C: BEN
D: Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
N: Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined smile.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
N: The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper questions Luke.
C: TROOPER
D: How long have you had these droids?
C: LUKE
D: About three or four seasons.
C: BEN
D: They're for sale if you want them.
C: TROOPER
D: Let me see your identification.
N: Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.
C: BEN
D: You don't need to see his identification.
C: TROOPER
D: We don't need to see his identification.
C: BEN
D: These are not the droids your looking for.
C: TROOPER
D: These are not the droids we're looking for.
C: BEN
D: He can go about his business.
C: TROOPER
D: You can go about your business.
C: BEN
D: Move along.
E: to Luke
C: TROOPER
D: Move along. Move along.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
N: The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder.
C: THREEPIO
D: I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
N: As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away.
C: LUKE
D: Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.
C: BEN
D: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.
C: LUKE
D: Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
C: BEN
D: Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.
C: LUKE
D: I'm ready for anything.
C: THREEPIO
D: Come along, Artoo.
S: INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA
N: The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots.
C: BARTENDER
D: We don't serve their kind here!
N: Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift.
C: LUKE
D: What?
C: BARTENDER
D: Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.
N: Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare. Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.
C: LUKE
D: Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble.
C: THREEPIO
D: I heartily agree with you sir.
N: Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks. Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold. Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee. Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever. A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.
C: CREATURE
D: Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
N: The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity.
C: HUMAN
D: He doesn't like you.
C: LUKE
D: I'm sorry.
C: HUMAN
D: I don't like you either.
N: The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer.
C: HUMAN
D: Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems.
C: LUKE
D: I'll be careful than.
C: HUMAN
D: You'll be dead.
N: The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind Luke.
C: BEN
D: This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...
N: A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. The bartender panics.
C: BARTENDER
D: No blasters! No blaster!
N: With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points the the Wookiee.
C: BEN
D: This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
N: Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro- droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street.
C: THREEPIO
D: I don't like the look of this.
S: INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA
N: Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and cocksure.
C: HAN
D: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
C: BEN
D: Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.
C: HAN
D: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
C: BEN
D: Should I have?
C: HAN
D: It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
N: Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.
C: HAN
D: I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?
C: BEN
D: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
C: HAN
D: What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
C: BEN
D: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
C: HAN
D: Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
C: LUKE
D: Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
C: HAN
D: But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
C: LUKE
D: You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...
C: BEN
D: We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
C: HAN
D: Seventeen, huh!
N: Han ponders this for a few moments.
C: HAN
D: Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
C: BEN
D: Ninety-four.
C: HAN
D: Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
N: Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. The bartender points to the booth.
C: TROOPER
D: All right, we'll check it out.
N: The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.
C: HAN
D: Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
C: BEN
D: You'll have to sell your speeder.
C: LUKE
D: That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.
S: INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA
N: As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
C: GREEDO
D: Going somewhere, Solo?
C: HAN
D: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
N: Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him.
C: GREEDO
D: It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.
C: HAN
D: Yeah, but this time I got the money.
C: GREEDO
D: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
C: HAN
D: I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
C: GREEDO
D: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
C: HAN
D: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
N: Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
C: GREEDO
D: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
C: HAN
D: Over my dead body.
C: GREEDO
D: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
C: HAN
D: Yes, I'll bet you have.
N: Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves.
C: HAN
D: Sorry about the mess.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM
C: VADER
D: Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
N: An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.
C: IMPERIAL OFFICER
D: The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?
C: TARKIN
D: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
C: VADER
D: What do you mean?
C: TARKIN
D: I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.
E: to soldier
C: TROOPER
D: With pleasure.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
N: Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and hiding from the hot winds.
C: THREEPIO
D: Lock the door, Artoo.
N: One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.
C: TROOPER
D: All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door.
N: The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.
C: THREEPIO
D: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
N: Artoo makes beeping sounds.
C: THREEPIO
D: You watch your language!
S: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED
N: SPEEDER LOT Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.
C: LUKE
D: He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand.
C: BEN
D: It will be enough.
N: Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley.
C: BEN
D: If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
S: INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY
N: Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth.
C: JABBA
D: Come on out, Solo!
N: A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.
C: HAN
D: I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
C: JABBA
D: I expected you would be.
C: HAN
D: I'm not the type to run.
C: JABBA
D: Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.
E: fatherly-smooth
C: HAN
D: You sent Greedo to blast me.
C: JABBA
D: Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you.
E: mock surprise
C: HAN
D: I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
C: JABBA
D: Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business.
C: HAN
D: You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.
C: JABBA
D: Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
E: to his men
C: HAN
D: Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.
S: EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY
N: Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94. Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street. Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot. He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter.
S: INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94
N: Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship.
C: LUKE
D: What a piece of junk.
N: The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.
C: HAN
D: She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself.
N: Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow.
C: HAN
D: We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
N: The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han Solo.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
N: Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship.
S: INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94
N: Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium Falcon passing Solo.
C: THREEPIO
D: Hello, sir.

D: All right, men. Load your weapons!
S: INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94]
N: The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance.
C: TROOPER
D: Stop that ship!
N: Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship.
C: TROOPER
D: Blast 'em!
N: Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
C: HAN
D: Chewie, get us out of here!
N: The group straps in for take off.
C: THREEPIO
D: Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
S: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS
N: The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.
S: EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE
N: The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: Han frantically types information into the ship's computer. Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.
C: HAN
D: It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
S: EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE
N: The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial stardestroyers.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.
C: HAN
D: Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
C: LUKE
D: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.
C: HAN
D: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
S: EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE
N: Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.
C: HAN
D: Here's where the fun begins!
C: BEN
D: How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
C: HAN
D: It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
N: The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.
C: LUKE
D: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...
C: HAN
D: Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
N: The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash.
C: LUKE
D: What's that flashing?
C: HAN
D: We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
N: The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second.
S: EXT. DEATH STAR
N: Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM
N: Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet.
C: MOTTI
D: We've entered the Alderaan system.
N: Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her hands are bound.
C: LEIA
D: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
C: TARKIN
D: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
C: LEIA
D: I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
C: TARKIN
D: Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
C: LEIA
D: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
C: TARKIN
D: Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
C: LEIA
D: No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
C: TARKIN
D: You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
N: Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.
C: TARKIN
D: I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?
N: Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to Alderaan.
C: LEIA
D: Dantooine.
E: softly
N: Leia lowers her head.
C: LEIA
D: They're on Dantooine.
C: TARKIN
D: There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
E: addressing Motti
C: LEIA
D: What?
C: TARKIN
D: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
C: LEIA
D: No!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

D: Commence primary ignition.
N: A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA
N: Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, seems almost faint.
C: LUKE
D: Are you all right? What's wrong?
C: BEN
D: I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
N: Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then he fixes his gaze on Luke.
C: BEN
D: You'd better get on with your exercises.
N: Han Solo enters the room.
C: HAN
D: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.
N: Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.
C: HAN
D: Don't everyone thank me at once.
N: Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board.
C: HAN
D: Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
N: Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- covered arms over his head.
C: THREEPIO
D: Now be careful, Artoo.
N: Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.
C: THREEPIO
D: He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.
C: HAN
D: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
E: interrupting
C: THREEPIO
D: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
C: HAN
D: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
C: THREEPIO
D: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.
N: Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. Han watches with a bit of smugness.
C: BEN
D: Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
C: LUKE
D: You mean it controls your actions?
C: BEN
D: Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
N: Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.
C: HAN
D: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
C: LUKE
D: You don't believe in the Force, do you?
C: HAN
D: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
N: Ben smiles quietly.
C: HAN
D: It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
C: BEN
D: I suggest you try it again, Luke.
N: Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his eyes.
C: BEN
D: This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
C: LUKE
D: With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?
E: laughing
C: BEN
D: Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
N: Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
C: BEN
D: Stretch out with your feelings.
N: Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position.
C: BEN
D: You see, you can do it.
C: HAN
D: I call it luck.
C: BEN
D: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
C: HAN
D: Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else.
N: Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel.
C: HAN
D: Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
N: Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
C: LUKE
D: You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
C: BEN
D: That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
N: Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.
C: TARKIN
D: Yes.
C: OFFICER CASS
D: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
C: TARKIN
D: She lied! She lied to us!
C: VADER
D: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
C: TARKIN
D: Terminate her... immediately!
S: EXT. HYPERSPACE
N: The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
C: HAN
D: Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.
N: Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship.
C: HAN
D: What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.
N: The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit.
C: LUKE
D: What's going on?
C: HAN
D: Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
C: LUKE
D: What do you mean? Where is it?
C: HAN
D: Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.
C: LUKE
D: What? How?
N: Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down.
C: BEN
D: Destroyed... by the Empire!
C: HAN
D: The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
N: A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming.
C: HAN
D: There's another ship coming in.
C: LUKE
D: Maybe they know what happened.
C: BEN
D: It's an Imperial fighter.
N: Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.
C: LUKE
D: It followed us!
C: BEN
D: No. It's a short range fighter.
C: HAN
D: There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
C: LUKE
D: It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
C: HAN
D: Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions.
C: BEN
D: It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
C: HAN
D: Not for long...
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind Chewbacca.
C: BEN
D: A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
C: LUKE
D: It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
C: HAN
D: Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet.
C: LUKE
D: Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.
C: HAN
D: I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
N: The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station.
C: BEN
D: That's no moon! It's a space station.
C: HAN
D: It's too big to be a space station.
C: LUKE
D: I have a very bad feeling about this.
C: HAN
D: Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
N: The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station.
C: LUKE
D: Why are we still moving towards it?
C: HAN
D: We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
C: LUKE
D: But there's gotta be something you can do!
C: HAN
D: There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!
N: Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.
C: BEN
D: You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR
N: As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged.
S: EXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS
N: The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons. VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037
N: The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area.
C: OFFICER
D: To you stations! Come with me.
E: to another officer
S: INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
N: Stormtroopers run to their posts.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - HANGAR 2037
N: A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire.
C: OFFICER
D: Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
N: Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.
C: TARKIN
D: Yes.
C: VOICE
D: We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
E: over intercom
C: VADER
D: They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037
N: Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.
C: VOICE
D: Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
E: over intercom
C: OFFICER
D: There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
E: to Vader
C: VADER
D: Did you find any droids?
C: OFFICER
D: No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
C: VADER
D: Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
C: OFFICER
D: Yes, sir.
C: VADER
D: I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
N: Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.
C: OFFICER
D: Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY
N: A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker.
C: LUKE
D: Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
C: HAN
D: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
C: BEN
D: Leave that to me!
C: HAN
D: Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
C: BEN
D: Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
N: Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY
N: The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.
C: TROOPER
D: The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go.
N: The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.
C: HAN'S VOICE
D: Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
N: The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE
N: In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.
C: GANTRY OFFICER
D: TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
N: A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.
C: GANTRY OFFICER
D: Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.
N: As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.
C: LUKE
D: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
C: HAN
D: Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
C: THREEPIO
D: We found the computer outlet, sir.
N: Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel. Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
C: BEN
D: Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
N: Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.
C: THREEPIO
D: He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
N: The computer monitor flashes readouts.
C: THREEPIO
D: The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
N: Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
C: BEN
D: I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
C: HAN
D: Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.
C: LUKE
D: I want to go with you.
C: BEN
D: Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
C: LUKE
D: But he can...
C: BEN
D: They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you... always!
N: Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement.
C: HAN
D: Boy you said it, Chewie.
N: Han looks at Luke.
C: HAN
D: Where did you dig up that old fossil?
C: LUKE
D: Ben is a great man.
C: HAN
D: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
C: LUKE
D: I didn't hear you give any ideas...
C: HAN
D: Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...
C: LUKE
D: Who do you think...
N: Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. Luke goes over to him.
C: LUKE
D: What is it?
C: THREEPIO
D: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here."
C: LUKE
D: Well, who... who has he found?
N: Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
C: THREEPIO
D: Princess Leia.
C: LUKE
D: The princess? She's here?
C: HAN
D: Princess? What's going on?
C: THREEPIO
D: Level five. Detention block A A-twenty- three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
C: LUKE
D: Oh, no! We've got to do something.
C: HAN
D: What are you talking about?
C: LUKE
D: The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her.
C: HAN
D: Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.
C: LUKE
D: But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
C: HAN
D: I'm not going anywhere.
C: LUKE
D: They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.
C: HAN
D: Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
C: LUKE
D: But they're going to kill her!
C: HAN
D: Better her than me...
C: LUKE
D: She's rich.
N: Chewbacca growls.
C: HAN
D: Rich?
C: LUKE
D: Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
C: HAN
D: What?
C: LUKE
D: Well more wealth that you can imagine.
C: HAN
D: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
C: LUKE
D: You'll get it!
C: HAN
D: I better!
C: LUKE
D: You will...
C: HAN
D: All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.
N: Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.
C: LUKE
D: All right.
C: HAN
D: What's your plan?
C: LUKE
D: Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
N: Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
C: LUKE
D: Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.
N: Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
C: LUKE
D: Okay. Han, you put these on.
N: Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
C: HAN
D: Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
N: The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.
C: THREEPIO
D: Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
C: LUKE
D: Lock the door!
C: HAN
D: And hope they don't have blasters.
C: THREEPIO
D: That isn't very reassuring.
N: Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE
N: Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance. Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
C: LUKE
D: I can't see a thing in this helmet.
N: A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY
N: Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY
N: AREA Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
C: HAN
D: This is not going to work.
C: LUKE
D: Why didn't you say so before?
C: HAN
D: I did say so before!
S: INT. DETENTION AREA
N: Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio.
C: OFFICER
D: Where are you taking this... thing?
N: Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up.
C: LUKE
D: Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight.
C: OFFICER
D: I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.
N: The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. There are only three other troopers in the area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke. Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.
C: HAN
D: Look out! He's loose!
C: LUKE
D: He's going to pull us all apart.
C: HAN
D: Go get him!
N: The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on. He quickly checks the computer readout.
C: HAN
D: We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here.
N: Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the buzzing comlink.
C: HAN
D: Everything is under control. Situation normal.
E: sounding official
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: What happened?
C: HAN
D: Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?
E: getting nervous
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: We're sending a squad up.
C: HAN
D: Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: Who is this? What's your operating number?
N: Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.
C: HAN
D: Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!
E: yelling down the hall
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW
N: Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open.
C: LEIA
D: Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?
E: finally
N: Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.
C: LUKE
D: What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.
C: LEIA
D: You're who?
C: LUKE
D: I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
C: LEIA
D: Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
C: LUKE
D: Come on!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
N: Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table.
C: VADER
D: He is here...
C: TARKIN
D: Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?
C: VADER
D: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
C: TARKIN
D: Surely he must be dead by now.
C: VADER
D: Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
C: TARKIN
D: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
N: There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.
C: TARKIN
D: Yes.
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty- three.
C: TARKIN
D: The princess! Put all sections on alert!
C: VADER
D: Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
C: TARKIN
D: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
C: VADER
D: Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY
N: An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door.
C: HAN
D: Chewie!
N: Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.
C: HAN
D: Get behind me! Get behind me!
N: A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge. Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.
C: HAN
D: Can't get out that way.
C: LEIA
D: Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
C: HAN
D: Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
E: sarcastically
N: Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor.
C: LUKE
D: See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
C: THREEPIO
D: Yes sir?
E: over comlink
C: LUKE
D: We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER
N: Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter.
C: THREEPIO
D: I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted.
N: Someone begins banging on the door.
C: TROOPER VOICE
D: Open up in there!
C: THREEPIO
D: Oh, no!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR
N: Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.
C: LUKE
D: There isn't any other way out.
C: HAN
D: I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
C: LEIA
D: This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
C: HAN
D: He's the brains, sweetheart.
E: pointing to Luke
N: Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.
C: LUKE
D: Well, I didn't...
N: The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to Han, almost frying him.
C: HAN
D: What the hell are you doing?
C: LEIA
D: Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
N: She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something.
C: HAN
D: Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it.
N: Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening.
C: HAN
D: Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!
N: Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
N: Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck. Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't budge.
C: HAN
D: Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...
E: sarcastically
C: LUKE
D: No! wait!
N: Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.
C: LUKE
D: Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!
C: LEIA
D: Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.
C: HAN
D: Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
C: LEIA
D: It could be worse...
N: A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.
C: HAN
D: It's worse.
C: LUKE
D: There's something alive in here!
C: HAN
D: That's your imagination.
C: LUKE
D: Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?
C: HAN
D: What?
C: LUKE
D: Help!
N: Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.
C: HAN
D: Luke! Luke! Luke!
N: Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat.
C: LEIA
D: Luke!
N: Leia extends a long pipe toward him.
C: LEIA
D: Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
C: LUKE
D: Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.
C: HAN
D: Where?
C: LUKE
D: Anywhere! Oh!!
N: Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle.
C: HAN
D: Luke! Luke!
N: Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet. Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface.
C: LEIA
D: Grab him!
N: Luke seems to be released by the thing.
C: LEIA
D: What happened?
C: LUKE
D: I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
C: HAN
D: I've got a very bad feeling about this.
N: Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels.
C: LUKE
D: The walls are moving!
C: LEIA
D: Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something.
N: They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.
C: LUKE
D: Wait a minute!
N: Luke pulls out his comlink.
C: LUKE
D: Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE
N: A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.
C: FIRST TROOPER
D: Take over! See to him! Look there!
E: pointing to the dead officer
N: A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office.
C: THREEPIO
D: They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.
C: FIRST OFFICER
D: Follow me! You stand guard.
E: to his troops
N: The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office.
C: THREEPIO
D: Come on!
E: to Artoo
N: The guard aims a blaster at them.
C: THREEPIO
D: Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
C: TROOPER
D: All right.
N: The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the door.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
N: As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller. Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws. Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.
C: LUKE
D: Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
N: Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. Leia begins to sink into the trash.
C: HAN
D: Get to the top!
C: LEIA
D: I can't
C: LUKE
D: Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL
C: THREEPIO
D: They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured.
N: Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot.
C: THREEPIO
D: Hurry!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
N: The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body.
C: HAN
D: One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!
E: to Leia
C: LEIA
D: I'm trying!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL
C: THREEPIO
D: Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be?
E: to Artoo
N: Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
C: THREEPIO
D: Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
N: Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL
N: Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly.
C: THREEPIO
D: Are you there, sir?
S: INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
C: LUKE
D: Threepio!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL
C: THREEPIO
D: We've had some problems...
C: LUKE
D: Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?
E: over comlink
S: INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
C: LUKE
D: Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL
C: LUKE
D: Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
E: over comlink
C: THREEPIO
D: No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
E: to Artoo
N: Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.
C: THREEPIO
D: Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!
C: LUKE
D: Threepio, we're all right!
E: over comlink
S: INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM
N: The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the background.
C: LUKE
D: We're all right. You did great.
N: Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number.
C: LUKE
D: Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL
C: HAN
D: Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
E: over comlink
S: INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH
N: Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables. He carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to blue.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY
N: The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway. Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts.
C: HAN
D: If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
N: Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from Solo.
C: LUKE
D: Well, let's get moving!
N: Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling.
C: HAN
D: Where are you going?
E: to Chewie
N: The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim. Han aims his pistol.
C: LEIA
D: No, wait. They'll hear!
N: Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply shakes his head in disgust.
C: HAN
D: Come here, you big coward!
E: to Chewie
N: Chewie shakes his head "no."
C: HAN
D: Chewie! Come here!
C: LEIA
D: Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?
N: Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
C: HAN
D: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me!
C: LEIA
D: It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
E: looking at Chewie
N: Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.
C: HAN
D: No reward is worth this.
N: They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH
N: Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of him.
C: OFFICER
D: Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
C: FIRST TROOPER
D: Give me regular reports.
N: All but two of the stormtroopers leave.
C: FIRST TROOPER
D: Do you know what's going on?
C: SECOND TROOPER
D: Maybe it's another drill.
N: Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway.
C: SECOND TROOPER
D: What was that?
C: FIRST TROOPER
D: Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
N: Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.
C: HAN
D: There she is.
E: looking at his ship
C: LUKE
D: See-Threepio, do you copy?
C: THREEPIO
D: For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
E: voice
C: LUKE
D: We're right above you. Stand by.
N: Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship.
C: LEIA
D: You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.
C: HAN
D: Nice! Come on!
N: Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.
C: FIRST TROOPER
D: It's them! Blast them!
N: Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.
C: HAN
D: Get back to the ship!
E: to Luke and Leia
C: LUKE
D: Where are you going? Come back!
N: Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
C: LEIA
D: He certainly has courage.
C: LUKE
D: What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!
N: Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
N: Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
N: Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running the other way also.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY
N: Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT
N: Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back.
C: LUKE
D: I think we took a wrong turn.
E: gasping
N: Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang. Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.
C: LEIA
D: There's no lock!
N: Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.
C: LUKE
D: That oughta hold it for a while.
C: LEIA
D: Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
C: LUKE
D: Oh, I think I just blasted it.
N: Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds.
C: LEIA
D: They're coming through!
N: Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest. Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
C: LUKE
D: Here, hold this.
N: Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well. Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops.
C: LEIA
D: Here they come!
N: Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.
C: LEIA
D: For luck!
N: Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY
N: Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY
N: Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp.
C: THREEPIO
D: Where could they be?
N: Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR
N: Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail.
C: TROOPER
D: Close the blast doors!
N: At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut.
C: TROOPER
D: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
S: INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY
N: Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward.
C: VADER
D: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete.
N: Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.
C: VADER
D: When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
C: BEN
D: Only a master of evil, Darth.
N: The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes. Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.
C: VADER
D: Your powers are weak, old man.
C: BEN
D: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
N: Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY
N: Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
C: HAN
D: Didn't we just leave this party?
N: Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.
C: HAN
D: What kept you?
C: LEIA
D: We ran into some old friends.
C: LUKE
D: Is the ship all right?
C: HAN
D: Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
N: Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group's vantage point.
C: LUKE
D: Look!
N: Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY
N: Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's Imperial docking bay.
C: THREEPIO
D: Come on, Artoo, we're going!
N: Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY
N: Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The troops rush toward the battling knights.
C: HAN
D: Now's our chance! Go!
N: They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to deflect the blow and swiftly turns around. The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face. Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it. Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.
C: LUKE
D: No!
N: The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him. The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.
C: HAN
D: Come on!
E: to Luke
C: LEIA
D: Come on! Luke, its too late!
C: HAN
D: Blast the door! Kid!
N: Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.
C: BEN'S VOICE
D: Run, Luke! Run!
N: Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the troopers and races into the ship.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.
C: HAN
D: I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!
N: Chewbacca growls in agreement.
S: EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
N: The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness of space.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA
N: Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She sits down beside him.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: Solo spots approaching enemy ships.
C: HAN
D: We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
E: to Chewie
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA
N: Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.
C: LUKE
D: I can't believe he's gone.
N: Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.
C: LEIA
D: There wasn't anything you could have done.
N: Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the princess.
C: HAN
D: Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
E: to Luke
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

D: Got him! I got him!
N: Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully returns.
C: HAN
D: Great kid! Don't get cocky.
N: Han turns back to his laser cannon.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking over her shoulder out the ports.
C: LEIA
D: There are still two more of them out there!
S: EXT. SPACE
N: A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts at it.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS
N: Luke and Han look into their respective projected target screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his face.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing destructive blasts at it.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS
N: Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.
S: EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER
N: The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, firing upon the Falcon.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT
N: Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of burning fragments.
C: LUKE
D: That's it! We did it!
E: laughing
N: The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.
C: LEIA
D: We did it!
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY
N: Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in the smoking, sparking wires.
C: THREEPIO
D: Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.
E: to Artoo
N: Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.
S: EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
N: The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically through space.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM
N: Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.
C: TARKIN
D: Are they away?
C: VADER
D: They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
C: TARKIN
D: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.
S: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
N: Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the damage. Leia is seated near Han.
C: HAN
D: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
C: LEIA
D: That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
C: HAN
D: Easy... you call that easy?
C: LEIA
D: Their tracking us!
C: HAN
D: Not this ship, sister.
N: Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.
C: LEIA
D: At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
C: HAN
D: What's so important? What's he carrying?
C: LEIA
D: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!
C: HAN
D: It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!
C: LEIA
D: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!
N: She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, passes Luke coming in.
C: LEIA
D: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
C: LUKE
D: I care!
N: Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han stare out at the vast blackness of space.
C: LUKE
D: So... what do you think of her, Han?
C: HAN
D: I'm trying not to, kid!
C: LUKE
D: Good...
E: under his breath
C: HAN
D: Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
C: LUKE
D: No!
N: Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at young Luke's jealousy.
S: EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN
N: The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.
S: EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN
N: The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.
S: EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST
N: An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside. He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely visible in the foliage.
S: EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE
N: Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the others are greeted by the Rebel troops. Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder.
S: INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK
N: The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.
C: WILLARD
D: You're safe! We had feared the worst.
E: holding Leia
N: Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.
C: WILLARD
D: When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
C: LEIA
D: We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope.
E: looking pointedly to Han
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red planet Yavin.
S: INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM
N: Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer the call.
C: TARKIN
D: Yes.
N: DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.
S: EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE
N: A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green.
S: INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA
N: Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back.
C: DODONNA
D: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large- scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
N: Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses Dodonna.
C: GOLD LEADER
D: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
C: DODONNA
D: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
N: Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left.
C: DODONNA
D: The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
N: A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.
C: DODONNA
D: Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
N: Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old.
C: WEDGE
D: That's impossible, even for a computer.
C: LUKE
D: It's not impossible. I used to bull's- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.
C: DODONNA
D: Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
N: The group rises and begins to leave.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon.
S: INT. DEATH STAR
N: Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and the forth moon. DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
C: VADER
D: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
S: INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK
N: Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
E: over loudspeaker
N: Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend's departure.
C: LUKE
D: So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
C: HAN
D: That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you.
C: LUKE
D: Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
E: getting angry
C: HAN
D: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide.
C: LUKE
D: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
N: Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.
C: HAN
D: Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!
N: Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off. Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,
C: HAN
D: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.
S: INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP
N: Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.
C: LEIA
D: What's wrong?
C: LUKE
D: Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
C: LEIA
D: He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
C: LUKE
D: I only wish Ben were here.
N: Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs his arm.
C: BIGGS
D: Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
C: LUKE
D: Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
N: Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born leader.
C: RED LEADER
D: Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty- five?
C: BIGGS
D: Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
N: Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter.
C: RED LEADER
D: I met your father once when I was just a boy, he was a great pilot. You'll do all right. If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
C: LUKE
D: Thank you, sir. I'll try.
N: Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
C: BIGGS
D: I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?
C: LUKE
D: I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
C: BIGGS
D: You did, all right. It's going to be like old times, Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!
E: going off
N: Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for his ship. As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter.
C: CHIEF
D: This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?
C: LUKE
D: Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
E: to Artoo
N: The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine. Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo beeps good-bye.
C: CHIEF
D: Okay, easy she goes!
C: THREEPIO
D: Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back.
N: Artoo beeps in agreement.
C: THREEPIO
D: You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
N: Artoo whistles his reply. All final preparations are made for the approaching battle. The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.
C: BEN'S VOICE
D: Luke, the Force will be with you.
N: Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.
S: EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE
N: All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud cover.
S: INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM
N: The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills the war room.
C: MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE
D: Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.
S: EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE
N: Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly pull away.

S: EXT. SPACE
N: The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna is built into the surface on one side.
S: INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT
N: Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome spectacle.

C: RED LEADER
D: Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys!
S: EXT. SPACE
N: As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

C: RED LEADER
D: We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

N: Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.
C: LUKE
D: I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
S: EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR
N: Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface with laserbolts.
S: INT. DEATH STAR
N: Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble. Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes up to him.
C: ASTRO-OFFICER
D: We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
C: VADER
D: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.
S: INT. DEATH STAR
N: Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

C: RED LEADER
D: Biggs! You've picked one up... watch it!
C: BIGGS
D: I can't see it! Where is he?!
S: EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

S: INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM
N: Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful. She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with happiness.
