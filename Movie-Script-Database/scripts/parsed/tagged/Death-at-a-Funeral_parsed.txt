S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: MUSIC CUE: The music fades out. TIGHT SHOT on AARON (CHRIS ROCK) thirties, dressed in a black suit and tie. He looks straight ahead with a somber expression. The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching FOUR UNDERTAKERS (INCLUDING BRIAN) place a coffin on a raised platform. The living room has been prepared for the funeral service, with several rows of chairs laid out.
C: BRIAN
D: Would you like to see... Aaron nods his head "yes", as BRIAN begins to open the coffin. Aaron crosses to the coffin. There's a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and braces himself for what he's about to see. The coffin opens and Aaron stares long and hard at the body.
C: AARON
D: Brian... who is that?
C: BRIAN
D: Excuse me?
C: AARON
D: Who is this man I'm looking at? 'Cause it's not my father.
C: BRIAN
D: Are you sure?
C: AARON
D: Are you asking me if I'm sure I know what my father looks like?
C: BRIAN
D: People make mistakes in times of grief.
C: AARON
D: Man, look at the damn body! Brian peers into the coffin. We see it's an ASIAN MAN.
C: BRIAN
D: Oh shit! The other undertakers look embarrassed.
C: AARON
D: Come on, Brian. You know what my father looks like. He used to take you to little league.
C: BRIAN
D: I'm sorry, man. I got a little nervous. This almost never happens.
C: AARON
D: It's happened before?! You mean this is a normal thing?... This isn't Burger King. You can't just mess up my order.
C: BRIAN
D: I think I know where he is.
C: AARON
D: You think?
T: CUT TO:

C: AARON
D: I better .,see my dad in this coffin in an hour, or you're going to take his place. The undertakers pick up the coffin and shuffle out awkwardly.
C: BRIAN
D: Don't worry. I'll get him, man.
C: AARON
D: You do that.
N: (TO HIMSELF) My people, my people, my people...
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: Aaron enters the bedroom. His wife, MICHELLE, also thirties, attractive, is putting on makeup with a thermometer hanging from her mouth. Aaron stands looking dumbfounded.
C: AARON
D: They brought the wrong body. Can you believe that?
C: MICHELLE
D: (muffled because of
C: THERMOMETER)
D: The wrong body?! Do they know where he is?
C: AARON
D: They think so. They're getting him now. The thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth..
C: MICHELLE
D: I told you not to use Marshals. But no, you wanted to keep it in the neighborhood. I know Swartz costs a little more, but at least they know where the bodies are. Michelle writes something down on a piece of paper as Aaron crosses the room and sits on the bed.
C: AARON
D: You were right. Please don't rub it in, not today. I've got so much to worry about. Michelle gets up and heads to the bathroom as Aaron takes out some index cards and looks them over.
C: AARON
D: Dad insisted on having the funeral here, Mom's crying all the time, Ryan didn't help with anything, not like he ever does! Plus my eulogy sucks. I can't wait until this day is over.
E: CONT'D
C: MICHELLE
D: Oh come on, honey. I'm sure it's not that bad.
E: O.S.
C: AARON
D: If it is, at least Dad's too dead to hear it. Michelle exits the bathroom.
C: MICHELLE
D: Honey, it's going to be fine.
C: AARON
D: It doesn't matter what I write. All anybody's going to be thinking is "why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? Even I'm going to be thinking it. She holds him close.
C: MICHELLE
D: Baby, you're the oldest. You have to do the eulogy. Besides, I think you're just as good a writer as your brother. You just need to let someone read your book. Aaronlooks away.
C: AARON
D: Soon. It's not ready to be read yet.
C: MICHELLE
D: I'm sure it's fine. Once the funeral's over, and everything dies
C: DOWN--
D: Aaron gives her a look.
C: MICHELLE
D: Sorry. Look, once this is all over, you know your mom's thinking about selling the house, so you know we've got to get out.of here. Aaron looks a little uncomfortable and heads to the bathroom.
E: CONT'D
C: MICHELLE
D: You called them, right? Silence from Aaron in the next room.
E: CONT'D
C: MICHELLE
D: Aaron?... You put the down payment on the condo, right?
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: I said I'd take care of it and I'll take care of it. Michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom.
E: O.C.
S: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Aaron is at the mirror.
C: MICHELLE
D: You better, because I can't live with your mother anymore. I've done my time, now it's time for your brother to take over. From now on, it's only Christmas and birthdays for us. Once we move, we can concentrate on your writing and our baby. Michelle gets down on her knees and starts unzipping Aaron's pants. Aaron pulls back.
C: AARON
D: Hey, hey, hey. Are you serious? We have to do this today? Michelle is still on the ground.
C: MICHELLE
D: Yes. Today's the last day of this cycle.
C: AARON
D: Can I at least find the body first?
S: EXT. FREEWAY - WIDE SHOT - DAY
N: We see NORMAN'S CAR speeding along the freeway.
S: INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
N: NORMAN, black, slightly heavier and riddled with anxiety, is driving. His friend, DEREK, an attractive, white, clean cut doctor, rides in the passenger seat.
C: NORMAN
D: I hate funerals. It's all death, death, death.
C: DEREK
D: I don't think funerals are designed for anybody to really like.
C: NORMAN
D: I don't want a regular funeral. When I die, I want people to celebrate my life.
N: Death at a Funeral 02/6/09
C: DEREK
D: Not me. I want it to be the saddest day ever. I want the stock market to stop. Schools to close. And no garbage pick-up. Derek starts to light a cigarette.
C: NORMAN
D: You still smoke?
C: DEREK
D: You used to smoke.
C: NORMAN
D: I used to piss my pants too, but I stopped. The only thing I want black is my skin. At least open the window. Derek opens the window very slightly.
C: NORMAN
D: I've got enough problems of my own to deal with.
E: CONT'D
N: DEREK (DUBIOUS) Yeah? What problems?
C: NORMAN
D: I told you... About the rash...
C: DEREK
D: Got to use condoms.
C: NORMAN
D: .on my hand...
C: DEREK
D: Still got to use condoms.
C: NORMAN
D: Look at it. Norman pulls up his sleeve and makes Derek look at his wrist, but he doesn't take a great deal of interest.
C: DEREK
D: That's not a rash.
C: NORMAN
D: What is it?
N: B.
C: DEREK
D: I don't know, but it doesn't look right.
C: NORMAN
D: Oh, damn. Norman continues to drive. Derek continues to smoke.
C: NORMAN
D: If you hate funerals so much why are you coming?
E: CONT'D
C: DEREK
D: You know why.
C: NORMAN
D: Come on, man, leave Elaine alone.
C: DEREK
D: I can't. She's the one.
C: NORMAN
D: So you're going to win her back over a dead body?
C: DEREK
D: If I have to.
S: INT. ELAINE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
N: ELAINE, very attractive, 27, and her boyfriend OSCAR, white, 35, are driving along wearing funeral attire. Oscar looks quite anxious as he keeps his eyes firmly on the road.
C: ELAINE
D: Are you okay?
C: OSCAR
D: Yeah, just a little nervous...
C: ELAINE
D: About seeing my dad?
C: OSCAR
D: I just don't think I've ever been so openly hated by anyone before.
C: ELAINE
D: He doesn't hate you. He just loved Derek.
C: OSCAR
D: Great. That makes me feel much better.
C: ELAINE
D: At least you know it's not you, so try not to get so nervous when he's around.
C: OSCAR
D: I can't help it. He puts me on edge. I feel like I owe him money.
C: ELAINE
D: He's going to be more.concerned that his brother-in-law just died. He won't be focused on you. Anyway, when I tell him we're getting married, he'll have to accept you. Elaine takes his hand. As they exchange a loving look, Oscar takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment. Suddenly there's a BUMP!!! And we see a bicyclist flying over Oscar's car. Oscar screeches to a halt. They jump out of the car.
C: OSCAR
D: Oh my God. Are you okay? The guy gets up. He's fine.
C: BIKE GUY
D: Yeah, I'm fine.
C: OSCAR
D: Are you sure? Is anything broken? I'm so sorry.
C: BIKE GUY
D: It was my fault. I ran a light. Oscar starts hyperventilating.
C: OSCAR
D: I could have killed you. What if you had cracked your head open? I'd have blood on my hands! Elaine shakes him.
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar, calm down!
N: (BEAT) (MORE)
C: ELAINE
D: You heard the man, he ran a light. Come on, let's get out of here before he wants to sue. She grabs him and pulls him into the car.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
N: The camera is close on Michelle's head which is moving back and forth. We pull back to reveal Aaron. They are doing it standing up.
C: MICHELLE
D: What's taking you so long?
C: AARON
D: I just started.
C: MICHELLE
D: You want this baby as much me. Come on.
C: AARON
D: I'm trying.
C: MICHELLE
D: If I didn't want you to come, you would have done it five minutes ago.
C: AARON
D: Do I have to do this today? The door opens and a HOUSEKEEPER sticks her head in.
C: HOUSEKEEPER
D: Who's picking up Uncle Russell?-- Aaron and Elaine quickly pull apart. As the Housekeeper steps back out into the hall.
C: AARON
D: Oh shit, Uncle Russell. Aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room.
S: INT. NORMAN'S CAR MOVING - DAY
N: Norman's cell phone RINGS. He answers.
C: NORMAN
D: Hello?... How are you?... Okay..
S: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C: AARON
D: I need you to pick up Uncle Russell.
S: INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS
C: NORMAN
D: Uncle Russell?! Damn! He's always in a bad mood.
S: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C: AARON
D: It's not a mood if he's always in it. It's his personality. Can you do it?
S: INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS
C: NORMAN
D: Alright... 'Alright. I'll do it. See you soon. Bye. Norman hangs up irritated.
S: EXT. WIDE SHOT OF A FREEWAY - DAY
N: We see Norman's car exiting the freeway.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Aaron and Michelle are standing to the side as the undertakers place the coffin on the stand. Brian nervously lifts the lid and Aaron looks inside. BRIAN (RESPECTFUL) So is this your father?
C: AARON
D: Come on, man. You know that's my father.
C: BRIAN
D: Just trying to be professional. What up, Michelle?
N: MICHELLE (DRYLY) Brian. He closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off. Aaron looks up and sees his mother, Cynthia, has entered the room. Cynthia is clearly drained and tired. She stares at the coffin.
C: AARON
D: Mom, how are you feeling?
C: CYNTHIA
D: There were so many things we wanted to do... We were going to go to China.
C: AARON
D: China? You don't even like Chinese food.
C: CYNTHIA
D: That's not the point. I haven't been feeling good. Who knows how long I'm going to live without him. It happens all the time. One spouse goes and then the next. I mean, it might be different if I had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything.
C: MICHELLE
D: Cynthia, I-- They all cross to the coffin.
C: AARON
D: Come on, Mom. You're healthy. You'll be fine. You've got your friends and family... Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin.

N: She looks down at the coffin. Aaron turns away frustrated. Michelle gently touches the coffin.
C: MICHELLE
D: Do you need anything, Cynthia?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yeah, you can get your hand off my husband's coffin. You're leaving smudge marks. Michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve.
S: EXT. STREET - JEFF'S HOUSE - DAY
N: MUSIC: "PAPER PLANE" by M.I.A. Elaine and Oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college apartment building.
S: INT. JEFF'S HOUSE - SAME
N: The music is coming from Jeff's speakers. JEFF, dressed for the funeral, sits at his desk. He's holding a pill bottle that says: "VALIUM."
C: JEFF
D: Yeah, I found them. The ones in the Valium bottle?... Yeah... I'll get them to you this evening... Can't do this afternoon... It's your fault you left them here... I've got a funeral... My uncle died... Yeah, tragic... No, I haven't taken any. I saw what they did to you... What are they anyway?... The doorbell rings.
C: JEFF
D: I've gotta go, my sister's here... I'll take them with me and stop by after the funeral... Bye. The doorbell rings again.
E: CONT'D
C: JEFF
D: Hang on! Jeff stands up and we see that he's only half dressed for the funeral. He doesn't have any pants on.
E: CONT'D
N: He puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and lets Elaine and Oscar inside.
C: JEFF
D: Hey, what's up?
E: CONT'D
C: ELAINE
D: Do you always open the door half naked? Come on, Jeff. We're going to be late.
C: JEFF
D: I've just got to put my pants on and I'm ready. Oscar is still a little shaky.
N: JEFF (CONT'D) (RE: OSCAR) Is he okay?
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar's freaked out. A guy on a bike ran into the car.
C: OSCAR
D: It came out of nowhere. I didn't see him. I'm sorry.
C: ELAINE
D: It's okay, baby. Go put your damn pants on.
E: then to Jeff
C: JEFF
D: I'm going. I'm going. Jeff heads off to the bathroom and closes the door. Elaine spots the bottle of Valium on the table and picks it up.
C: ELAINE
D: Here. Take this..: It'll calm you down.
C: OSCAR
D: What is it?
C: ELAINE
D: It's just Valium. I used to take them all the time... It'll make you feel better, promise.
E: gets a glass of water
C: OSCAR
D: Are you sure? I mean, I've got to drive.
C: ELAINE
D: It'll be okay. I'll drive, honey. Come on, open wide. She pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water. Oscar swallows. Jeff returns wearing pants.
C: JEFF
D: Ready. Let's do it. Oscar and Elaine leave, Jeff surreptitiously picks up the Valium bottle, puts it in his pocket, then follows them out.
S: INT/EXT. ENTRY WAY - SAME TIME
N: CAMERA is in the entry way now shooting outside. A TOWN CAR exits, leaving Ryan in front of the house. RYAN, Aaron's younger brother is taller, more confident, and more successful. He moves slowly towards CAMERA and through the front doorway as CAMERA PULLS BACK with him.
C: RYAN
D: Hello! Mom!
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Michelle, Aaron and Cynthia are on the couch as Ryan enters the living room.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ryan! Cynthia runs over to Ryan and flings her arms around him. Aaron looks a bit lost in the background with Michelle but they walk over.
C: RYAN
D: I know this is hard, Mom. But you're going to be okay.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You always know exactly what to say, Ryan. I'm so glad you're here.
C: RYAN
D: I'm always here for you, Mom.
C: AARON
D: I guess if people died every week, we'd see you all the time. Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle.
C: RYAN
D: Aaron, how are you?
C: AARON
D: I'm alright.
C: MICHELLE
D: How was the flight?
C: RYAN
D: Okay. I had to buy the seat next to me because I don't trust the airlines with my bags. And there was a lot of turbulence... I guess that's the thing about flying first class. It doesn't matter how much you pay if the plane crashes, you still end up dead-- uh... Ryan realizes what he's said and stops speaking abruptly. It's too much for Cynthia who rushes upstairs.
C: AARON
D: "End up dead"?
C: RYAN
D: Oh damn.
C: MICHELLE
D: I'll make sure she's okay. Michelle heads off upstairs.
S: EXT. LAKEVIEW RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - SAME TIME
N: We see Norman's car turn into "Lakeview Retirement Community." He drives past the sign and through a gate.
S: INT. NORMAN'S CAR/EXT. LAKEVIEW - DAY
N: Norman is driving behind three OLD LADIES on mobile chairs. He's honking at them. He finally sees Uncle Russell.
C: NORMAN
D: There he is.
C: DEREK
D: You didn't tell me the guy was in a wheelchair. UNCLE RUSSELL, an elderly man in a wheelchair, sits in his chair. Norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man. He rolls down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his face.
N: NORMAN (OVER ENUNCIATING) Hello, Uncle Russell. How are you? We're here to take you to the funeral.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Where the fuck have you been, you fat bastard? You're late. If you took any longer I'd be dead, too. The fake smile falls off Norman's face.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Ryan sees the coffin and slowly heads over with Aaron trailing behind. He stands over the coffin. It finally registers that his DAD is actually in there.
C: RYAN
D: It's hard to see Dad like this. But he's in a better place now.
C: AARON
D: When does dead beat sick?
C: RYAN
D: I guess you're right. This is why I try not to get close to people. There's too much emotion involved.
C: AARON
D: Well that explains why you never call.
C: RYAN
D: What do you want me to say? Some families talk to each other all the time, some just see each other at funerals. That's us.
C: AARON
D: I guess it is.
N: Ryan takes a seat in one of the chairs flanking the coffin. Aaron sits as well.
C: AARON
D: By the way, I'm going to need that money.
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: What money?
C: AARON
D: The money for all this... the funeral. You're supposed to pay half.
C: RYAN
D: What about the insurance?
C: AARON
D: That's Mom's money.
C: RYAN
D: What about the pension?
C: AARON
D: That's Mom's money.
C: RYAN
D: Oh.
C: AARON
D: So we're spliting the cost.
C: RYAN
D: Are we?
C: AARON
D: Yes. We are.
C: RYAN
D: Oh, okay.
C: AARON
D: So?
C: RYAN
D: I don't have it right now.
C: AARON
D: What do you mean, you don't have it? You just bought a first class seat for your bag.
C: RYAN
D: And that's why I don't have any cash.
S: INT.. ELAINE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
N: Elaine is now driving, Oscar is sitting in the passenger seat looking a little spaced out, with Jeff in the back. Jeff leans forward.
C: JEFF
D: So, poor old Uncle Eddie...
C: ELAINE
D: Yeah. But he was sick for so long. He's much better off now.
C: JEFF
D: Dead? Since when does dead beat sick?
C: ELAINE
D: Shut up, Jeff. Jeff turns his attention to Oscar.
C: JEFF
D: I love when you come to family functions, Oscar. Because then Dad focuses all his hate on you. There's no response from Oscar. He looks distantly out the window. The pills are starting to kick in.
C: JEFF
D: Oscar?
E: CONT'D
C: OSCAR
D: Was there a dog in here just now? Elaine looks at Oscar very-strangely.
C: ELAINE
D: What? He sniffs.
C: OSCAR
D: Dalmatian? No, Schnauzer... A beat.
C: ELAINE
D: What the hell are you talking about? Oscar falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window.
S: INT. NORMAN'S CAR - LATER
N: Uncle Russell is asleep in the back. Norman is looking for a parking space, but the street and long driveway are packed with cars. A catering truck and flower van are taking up a lot of space.
C: NORMAN
D: There's nowhere to park. Then the small flower delivery van pulls out. Derek points out the newly empty space.
C: DEREK
D: That truck is pulling out. Park there.
C: NORMAN
D: Alright. Just as he's about to drive in, another car takes it.
C: NORMAN
D: What the hell?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Norman gets out of the car. The other car contains Jeff, Oscar and Elaine. Jeff gets out first followed by Elaine.
C: NORMAN
D: Elaine, I was going to park there.
C: ELAINE
D: Are you family, Norman?
C: NORMAN
D: Well, no, but I'm like family.
C: ELAINE
D: No such thing. Derek leans out the window.
C: DEREK
D: Hi, Elaine.
C: ELAINE
D: What are you doing here?
C: DEREK
D: Your father invited me.
C: ELAINE
D: Oh please. She grabs Oscar and heads to the house followed by Jeff.
S: INT. NORMAN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Norman gets back into his car. Uncle Russell stirs.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: What's happening?
C: DEREK
D: Did you see that?... She totally blew me off. The flower delivery van has been waiting to move forward. It's driver beeps the horn.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: I said what's happening? Are we there?. Norman turns around and looks at Uncle Russell.
C: NORMAN
D: Aw, damn. I have Uncle Russell. How could I forget about Uncle Russell? Derek has other concerns and the van beeps again.
C: NORMAN
D: Yeah, alright!!
E: CONT'D to the Van
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: What the hell is going on? Uncle Russell pokes Norman with his cane.
C: NORMAN
D: Ow.
C: DEREK
D: .barely even looked.
N: Norman, now highly irritated, is forced to drive backwards.
S: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY
N: Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are walking to the house as other people arrive.
C: OSCAR
D: It's very green here, isn't it?... Green... Very green... Very... green. Elaine takes Oscar to the side.
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar, are you alright?
C: OSCAR
D: What do you mean?
C: ELAINE
D: All this talking about phantom dogs and things being green... What's going on?
C: OSCAR
D: What are you talking about? I' fine . Never been greener. Oscar wanders off, leaving Elaine with Jeff.
C: JEFF
D: Elaine, what's wrong with Oscar?
C: ELAINE
D: I don't know. Something's not right... ANGLE ON: Oscar as he wanders around the yard.
C: ELAINE
D: I think it's the Valium.
E: CONT'D
C: JEFF
D: Valium?!
C: ELAINE
D: I gave him a Valium at your place. I think he's just not used to it.
C: JEFF
D: Oh, right.
N: Jeff's face reveals his realization of what's happened. He walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar.
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: Norman's car is almost at the corner still being forced backwards by the flower van. We see that Derek is still lost in his own thoughts. Uncle Russell is poking at Norman with his cane.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: You're going the wrong way!
C: NORMAN
D: Ow! That hurts.
C: DEREK
D: Stop the car, Norman.
C: NORMAN
D: What?
C: DEREK
D: Stop the car. I have to speak with her. I have to speak with Elaine. Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets out.
C: NORMAN
D: What about Uncle Russell? I need help with Uncle Russell! It's too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman honks the horn.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: What's going on here? Where are we?! We're going to be late! Russell hits him on the arm with his cane.
C: NORMAN
D: Ow! Can you please stop doing that?! The van keeps beeping. Norman backs up.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Ryan is standing with Aaron. They greet the mourners. RYAN (TO MOURNER) Nice to see you again. The mourner shakes hands with Ryan then walks away.
C: RYAN
D: Who are all these people? I don't even recognize half of them.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: It's your family. You don't recognize them from the last funeral? Ryan looks around the room.
C: RYAN
D: So what side of the family is he on?
C: AARON
D: Who?
C: RYAN
D: The guy in the leather jacket. Ryan looks around the room and sees a FOUR FOOT SIX MAN approaching the coffin.
E: FRANK
C: AARON
D: I have no idea. Maybe a friend of Dad's from work or something. Aaron turns to Ryan.
C: AARON
D: So, you're telling me I'm going to have to pay for the whole funeral?
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: No I'm telling you you'll have the money in a few months when I get my advance.
C: AARON
D: I'm not a God damn credit agency! REVEREND DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Aaron, how are you?
C: AARON
D: Yes, um... We're just waiting for everyone to arrive, then we can get going. I know you're in a hurry.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Yes, I have two more funerals and a Christening. I don't know what it is about the Spring, but they're either coming in or going out. She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her. Reverend Davis stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan.
C: AARON
D: Have you met my brother, Ryan?
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Ah, the writer, of course. I must admit I squeezed this job in because I wanted to meet you. I'm reading "Mama's Secret" right now. Don't tell anybody, I'm not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff.
C: RYAN
D: I'm sure the Lord will forgive you. Aaron is irritated.
N: REVEREND DAVIS (TO AARON) You must be very proud of your big brother. He really made something of his life. (TO RYAN) I can't wait to hear your eulogy.
C: AARON
D: No, no, I'm doing the eulogy.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Oh. I thought...
C: RYAN
D: Aaron is the oldest. The reverend tries her best not to look disappointed.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Great... Well, I'll just make sure have everything I need.
N: She looks at the coffin and then at the Bible in her hands.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: We've got a body and a Bible. Well, I'm all set. She walks off.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: Look, I think you should do the eulogy. Everyone's expecting you to do it.
C: RYAN
D: No, they're not. You're the oldest. You should do it.
C: AARON
D: Look most of the people are here for Dad, but let's not kid ourselves. A lot of them are here to hear your eulogy.
C: RYAN
D: So imagine how surprised they'll be when they hear yours. Ryan walks away.
S: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: Cynthia is helping prepare the food to go.out. Michelle is in the background at the sink. DUNCAN, Cynthia's brother, a middle aged doctor, approaches.
C: DUNCAN
D: How's my little sister?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm trying to hold it together, Duncan. He was a really good husband. My friends always told me about the crap their husbands put them through. I never had to deal with any of that. Remember when Uncle Matt got that nanny pregnant?
C: DUNCAN
D: That was horrible.
C: CYNTHIA
D: They don't make 'em like my Edward anymore. A good husband and a great father to two healthy, strong boys. Michelle cringes in the background.
N: MICHELLE (TO CYNTHIA) I'll make you a cup of coffee, Cynthia.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Coffee can do many things Michelle, but it can't bring back the dead. Beat.
C: MICHELLE
D: Tea?
S: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Aaron finds a quiet place in the hallway and pulls out his notes. AARON (READS) "My father was an exceptional man... My father was an exceptional man... My father was an exceptional man..." Michelle approaches him.
C: MICHELLE
D: Honey, we still need to finish that thing. Remember today is the last day.
C: AARON
D: Can we talk about this when there's a little less death in the air?
C: MICHELLE
D: No. No we can't.
C: AARON
D: Honey, I'm just not in the mood...
C: MICHELLE
D: I don't have any panties on.
C: AARON
D: What? You don't have any panties on? It's my father's funeral.
C: MICHELLE
D: I'm just trying to help you out. I'll put them back on before the service starts. Now come on. They turn. Aaron looks around the corner into the living room and sees the four foot six man standing by a table. Aaron stops Michelle.
C: AARON
D: Babe, don't make it obvious, but that guy in the leather jacket standing by the wall. Don't look. Don't look. Don't look. Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy.
C: AARON
D: Do you recognize him?
E: CONT'D
C: MICHELLE
D: Isn't that the guy from the Home Depot?
C: AARON
D: No, I don't think so. Don't look. Don't look.
C: MICHELLE
D: Did he put in the cable?
C: AARON
D: No, no, that's not it. He keeps looking at me. Don't look. Don't look.
C: MICHELLE
D: He's probably just a friend of your father's. I'll meet you in the garage. We have a few minutes before Uncle Russell gets here. Michelle walks off. Aaron peeks around the corner again and makes eye contact with the four foot six inch man, who seems to be staring straight at him. Aaron averts his eyes and heads off.
S: EXT. ROAD - DAY
N: Norman parks the car and gets out. He goes to the trunk and removes the wheelchair.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: What are you doing?! Be careful with that. Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently.

E: CONT'D
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Aaron tries to get across the room as Michelle heads into the kitchen. Ryan stops Aaron.
C: AARON
D: Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out--
C: RYAN
D: God damn, that Martina has grown up. ANGLE ON: MARTINA, nineteen and attractive.
C: AARON
D: Are you talking about Little Martina?
C: RYAN
D: She was like a teenager when I left, and now she's... you know. She's like damn. Aaron looks distastefully at his brother.
C: AARON
D: Can you keep an eye out for Uncle Russell?
C: RYAN
D: I think I should go see how she's been.
C: AARON
D: Yeah, why don't you do that? See if she wants a juice box.
N: Ryan heads off towards Martina. Aaron continues across the room.
C: FRANK
D: Hi there. Aaron turns and finds himself cornered by Frank.
E: O.S.
C: AARON
D: Hello.
C: FRANK
D: I was really sorry to hear about your dad. He talked about you a lot. I saw your wedding pictures. Your wife's dress was very beautiful. Aaron is a little uncomfortable.
C: AARON
D: Uh... thanks.
C: MAN
D: Did he ever mention me?... Frank? Frank steps forward and holds out his hand. Aaron shakes it.
C: AARON
D: Frank?... I don't think so, no... Were you a friend of his?
C: FRANK
D: Something like that, yeah. Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen.
C: MICHELLE
D: Honey. Can I see you for a moment?
C: AARON
D: Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone.
S: EXT. STREET - SAME TIME
N: WIDE SHOT: Norman struggles to push Uncle Russell up a hill.

N: Aaron has almost made it across the room when he is intercepted by Reverend Davis.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: I think we should get started. really have to leave at three.
C: AARON

C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: .Of course.
S: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY
N: Elaine and Jeff are talking to some mourners.
C: ELAINE
D: It's so nice to see you.
C: WOMAN
D: I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle. But he's in a better place now. I hear Ryan is doing the eulogy. Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation.
C: OSCAR
D: Look... Isn't it beautiful? He wanders off again. Elaine doesn't know what the hell is going on.
C: JEFF
D: Elaine, can I speak to you for a minute?
C: ELAINE
D: I'll see you inside. Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the side.
E: to the mourner
C: ELAINE
D: What? What is it?!
E: CONT'D
C: JEFF
D: I have to tell you something and, I'm warning you in advance, you're not going to like it. Elaine looks at Jeff concerned.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Aaron is intercepted again by Duncan who is talking to Ryan.
C: DUNCAN
D: Aaron. How are we doing on time?
C: AARON
D: As soon as Uncle Russell gets here we'll be ready to start.
C: DUNCAN
D: So what's this I hear about Ryan not doing the eulogy?
C: RYAN
D: I was just telling him how much I'm looking forward to hearing your eulogy.
C: DUNCAN
D: That's a shame. I mean, I'm sure you'll be good, Aaron. It's just with Ryan being the writer of the family...
C: AARON
D: Yeah.
C: DUNCAN
D: There are people here that don't even know your father. They just came to hear Ryan.
C: AARON
D: Would you excuse me? Aaron walks away.
N: DUNCAN (TO RYAN) So any new books coming out? I just finished "Black Hurt.
S: INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME
N: Aaron closes the door behind him. Michelle is waiting. They start kissing and pulling at each other's clothes. Aaron stops and leans on the door and sighs.
C: MICHELLE
D: Are you alright?
C: AARON
D: Every single person wants Ryan to do the eulogy. He was my father, too. I'm supposed to do the damn eulogy! I'm the oldest. Where was Ryan when I was taking care of Dad?
C: MICHELLE
D: Calm down. Calm down. Forget about everyone. You're going to do the eulogy and it's going to be the best eulogy anyone's every heard. Now could you please do me a favor and get me pregnant?
C: AARON
D: Come on, do I have to do this today?
C: MICHELLE
D: Yes. What do you want? You want me to talk dirty? I'm gonna suck it. I'm gonna to suck it. Before Michelle can continue her PG rated dirty talk, there is a knock on the door.
C: MAN
D: Is there more soda in here?
C: AARON
D: Yes! Come in! Michelle is frustrated.
S: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY
N: Elaine is looking at Jeff in absolute shock.
C: ELAINE
D: What do you mean it's not Valium?
C: JEFF
D: I mean what you thought was Valium, wasn't actually Valium. It's a hallucinogenic. Like, acid, mescaline... Special K... Oscar moves in the background behind Elaine and Jeff. Elaine looks at him. He's making strange contorted expressions with his face and pointing at the sky. Other people are starting to notice him and think he's slightly odd.
C: ELAINE
D: This isn't funny, Jeff.
C: JEFF
D: I'm not being funny. Look at him, he's high as a kite! Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush.
C: ELAINE
D: What the hell are you doing leaving that stuff around your house?!
C: JEFF
D: A friend left it. And who the hell just goes into someone's house and takes pills?
C: ELAINE
D: I thought they were Valium! What am I supposed to do? Should I tell him?
E: takes a deep breath
C: JEFF
D: No, don't do that. It'll just freak him out... We'll just keep a close eye on him, and make sure he doesn't get out of control... And don't let him spend too long talking to one person... or bush. Oscar wanders into the front door. Elaine quickly follows him. Jeff reluctantly follows Elaine. Derek arrives in time to see this and follows as well.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Oscar wanders in, followed by Elaine and Jeff. Duncan sees them enter and approaches them.
C: ELAINE
D: Hi, Dad. How are you? She gives him a kiss.
C: DUNCAN
D: Not bad considering we're at a funeral. Jeff steps forward.
C: JEFF
D: Hi, Dad. He shakes his hand.
C: DUNCAN
D: How's Pepperdine treating you? Is Professor Clarke still giving you a hard time?
C: JEFF
D: No, no. It's all worked out. Don't worry.
C: DUNCAN
D: I'm not worried about you. Duncan looks pointedly at Elaine, irritating her. Duncan looks at Oscar who is in the background.
C: DUNCAN
D: So I see you brought your friend.
E: CONT'D
C: ELAINE
D: He's my boyfriend. And you know his name. Derek approaches.
C: DEREK
D: Doctor, how nice to see you again.
C: DUNCAN
D: Derek. How are you doing at the hospital?
C: DEREK
D: Great. Great. We should have lunch soon. I'd love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at Cedar's.
C: DUNCAN
D: Definitely. Maybe Elaine would like to join us for lunch? They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away disgusted. Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello. Oscar stares at her.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Elaine... Jeff... good to see you.
C: ELAINE
D: I'm so sorry, Auntie. We're going to miss Uncle Edward so much.
C: JEFF
D: Yeah. He was a great guy.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Thank you.
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar, this is my Aunt-- Oscar grabs Cynthia in a tight hug.
C: OSCAR
D: I'm so sorry about... the death... He sings "Amazing Grace" softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and Elaine look on.
C: OSCAR
D: Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me... Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar. She heads back outside. Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after Cynthia.
E: CONT'D
C: JEFF
D: What are you going to do?
C: ELAINE
D: I don't know. I can't leave. Aunt Cynthia would never speak to me again. Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He rushes outside. Elaine follows. Derek follows suit.
S: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY
N: We see Oscar emerging from the front doorway followed by Jeff. Then comes Elaine. Jeff approaches Oscar and stands with him as Elaine watches from the doorway. Derek walks up.
C: DEREK
D: You look nice, Elaine.
C: ELAINE
D: I'm dressed for a funeral.
C: DEREK
D: Yeah, but you make death look sexy. She looks at him.
C: DEREK
D: So, I heard about the engagement.
E: CONT'D
C: ELAINE
D: Hey, hey. I don't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me. But I have not told my dad yet, so I would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut.
C: DEREK
D: Sure. Anything for you. Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered.
C: DEREK
D: So that's him? That's the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with? Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar. Oscar leans over like he's on a nod. Jeff leans down with him, watching. Right before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then he starts walking.
E: CONT'D
C: ELAINE
D: Yep, that's him. Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into the house with Jeff in tow.
C: DEREK
D: Elaine., I- Elaine follows the guys, leaving Derek behind.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Aaron is straightening his tie and practicing his eulogy.
C: AARON
D: My father was an exceptional man... My father was-- Frank again approaches Aaron.
C: FRANK
D: Actually, there's something I'd like to talk to you about... when you have a minute. Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the background.
C: AARON
D: Yeah, that's great. Do you mind if we do it later though? My uncle just got here.
C: FRANK
D: Sure. Aaron heads off.
S: EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Norman pushes Russell up the stairs close to where Derek is standing. He looks like he's about to collapse from exhaustion. Norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath. Derek grabs the chair blocking Norman from view just as Aaron arrives.
C: AARON
D: Thank you, Derek, you're a life saver. Hope it wasn't too much trouble.
C: DEREK
D: No problem at all. Aaron wheels Uncle Russell inside.
C: AARON
D: How are you doing, Uncle Russell?
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Terrible. Derek follows, leaving Norman standing there out of breath.
C: NORMAN
D: Can I get a little help?
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Aaron enters and nods to Reverend Davis, who stands at the front.
C: REVEREND.DAVIS
D: Ladies and gentlemen, could you all kindly take your seats? We're about to begin the service. Ryan helps Martina to her seat. Jeff keeps an eye on Oscar. Elaine grabs Oscar and drags him to a seat. Aaron wheels Uncle Russell to his place.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Move! Move! He pokes people with his cane. Aaron then takes his seat with Michelle. Oscar is not looking so good. Ryan finally ends the conversation with Martina and heads to his seat. Reverend Davis is about to start, but waits as Norman, sweating, pushes through the crowd to his seat. The reverend waits for the disturbance to end, so Norman attracts the attention of everyone. Norman takes his seat next to Derek. Derek leans away.
N: DEREK (SNIFFS ) You stink.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Family and friends, we're gathered here today to mourn the passing of Edward Barnes.
C: NORMAN
D: Yeah, well, you left me to push Uncle Russell up that damn hill all by myself. Then took all the credit.
N: Elaine, turns around.
C: ELAINE
D: Norman, shut up. Elaine turns back around. Norman is irritated by this.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: I'd like to start with a favorite passage of Edwards from First Samuel chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King James Bible.
N: (READING) "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house..." While the reverend is talking, Norman pokes Elaine on the shoulder and leans forward. NORMAN (WHISPERS) Hey, Elaine, I know you don't think I'm part of the family--
C: ELAINE
D: 'Cause you're not.
N: NORMAN (WHISPERS) .but when you dissed me back there, I had Uncle Russell in the car. Aaron, disturbed by Norman's whispering, looks over. NORMAN (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) You stole my parking space, and I had to push him half a mile up a hill. We almost missed the service! Aaronlooks over again. ELAINE (WHISPERS) Look, Norman, if you poke me one more time, I'm going to kick your ass. AARON (WHISPERS LOUDLY) What the hell is going on?! NORMAN (WHISPERS) She stole my parking space!
C: AARON
D: Stole your parking space?!. My father's dead! Act right. Reverend Davis looks at them then continues her speech.
E: whispers to Norman
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: ."Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul..." As she speaks, Norman looks at his wrist, worried. The woman sitting next to him smacks his wrist down. ANGLE ON: Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar. Oscar is fidgeting and looking worried. ANGLE ON: Aaron and Michelle. Aaron looks worried.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: ."And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle." ANGLE ON: Oscar is laughing. Elaine tries to control him.
E: CONT'D
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: And now we'll have a few words from Edward's son, Aaron. Ryan's older brother. ANGLE ON: Aaron as he gathers himself. Michelle gives Aaron a supportive squeeze of the arm. Aaron looks over and sees Frank staring at him. ANGLE ON: Uncle Russell.
E: CONT'D
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? This is bullshit.
N: Aaron arrives at the front and looks out across the expectant crowd. He's extremely nervous.
C: AARON
D: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for coming... I never realized Dad was so popular. It looks like he's got more friends now that he's dead. Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia looks pained. Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly. Elaine silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his notes out.
E: his voice cracks
C: AARON
D: My father was an exceptional man... He was born in 1938. He grew up in Alabama on a farm. He loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend, Bobby. He told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake. As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I do?" Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted with pain. He looks like he's going to burst. ANGLE ON: Aaron.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: Dad's first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear rubber gloves. So my father got shocked a lot. Because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips. I asked my Dad what his first boss was like... The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar. He suddenly grabs Elaine's arm. Aaron keeps talking.
E: CONT'D
C: OSCAR
D: Did you just see that?
C: ELAINE
D: See what?
C: OSCAR
D: The coffin just moved.
C: ELAINE
D: What?
C: OSCAR
D: I'm telling you I saw it move. Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on with his eulogy.
C: AARON
D: .He said he was a nice man, and surprisingly well dressed. When Dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with his father. He never told me what that argument was about, but I do know that after leaving South Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch and never saw each other again. Dad went to college where he studied accounting, a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance... But his real passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance and musicals. He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance. Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the disruption with a disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who watches, concerned.
C: OSCAR
D: There, look. It happened again.
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar, please- People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid.
C: OSCAR
D: That coffin's moving!
N: ELAINE (WHISPERS) Oscar. Just calm down. Aaron looks over to Oscar. OSCAR (SHOUTS) The coffin's moving! Michelle looks worried. Cynthia watches silently. Oscar jumps up. Aaron stops the eulogy. Elaine is about to die from embarrassment.
C: OSCAR
D: There's someone alive in there!
E: CONT'D
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar, please sit down. Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin. People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff.
C: OSCAR
D: What the hell is wrong with you people?! Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais. Elaine tries to hold Oscar back, but she can't.
N: ELAINE (PANICKED) Oscar, where are you going?
C: AARON
D: What are you doing?
C: OSCAR
D: There's someone moving in there. Can't you see? Oscar tries to open the coffin. Aaron and Elaine try to restrain him, but can't. A tussle begins. Ryan jumps in to help.
C: RYAN
D: What the hell is wrong with you?!
C: ELAINE
D: Ryan, no!
N: Elaine attempts to grab Ryan. Duncan stands up and tries to help.
C: DUNCAN
D: Get away from there!
C: OSCAR
D: No, I have to show you! He's alive! He's alive! The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and struggling. Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips over. The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of Cynthia. Cynthia screams. Aaron freezes in shock. Michelle takes Cynthia through the kitchen. The living room is left in chaos.
S: EXT. BACK GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Elaine drags Oscar out the back. Jeff follows.
S: INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
N: Cynthia, in tears, enters accompanied by Aaron, Michelle and Reverend Davis.
C: MICHELLE
D: It's alright, Cynthia. It's alright. She sits in a chair crying uncontrollably. Aaron is so angry, he just marches out.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Some MEN grab the body and put it back in the coffin. Aaron comes out of the kitchen and heads to the back yard. As they put the coffin back on the stand, Ryan addresses the crowd.
C: RYAN
D: Please let me extend my apologies to you all. I understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking, but everything will be... returned... to it's proper place. Please enjoy the refreshments, and we'll call you when we're ready to continue.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: It wouldn't have happened if Ryan had done the eulogy. Aaron exits through the garden door.
S: EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY
N: Aaron storms out to Elaine who is trying to comfort Oscar. He's looking very disturbed. Jeff is also there, looking guilty.
C: AARON
D: Elaine, what the hell was that?!
C: ELAINE
D: I'm so sorry, Aaron.
C: AARON
D: Oh, okay. My dead father's sprawled out on the living room floor, but it's okay, you're sorry.
C: OSCAR
D: But the coffin was moving.
C: ELAINE
D: Please, Aaron. Go back inside. I'll explain later. An annoyed and confused Aaron turns and walks back to the house. He's almost to the door when Michelle arrives.
N: MICHELLE AARON--
C: AARON
D: No, I haven't made the call about the down payment yet.
C: MICHELLE
D: I wasn't going to say that.
C: AARON
D: No I'm not going to have sex with you.
C: MICHELLE
D: I wasn't going to say that.
C: AARON
D: What were you going to say?
N: MICHELLE (WEAKLY) Hi. He goes inside leaving Michelle standing there. Duncan comes out and heads for Oscar.
C: DUNCAN
D: I'll kill him! Elaine tries to keep Duncan away from Oscar, who is stressed enough and looks terrified.
C: ELAINE
D: Dad, leave it alone!
C: DUNCAN
D: Leave it alone?! He just knocked my brother-in-law out of his coffin.
C: ELAINE
D: It wasn't his fault.
C: DUNCAN
D: Yes it was. My sister is in tears. I can't believe you brought this idiot! I don't ever want to see him again, do you understand me?
C: ELAINE
D: I can't do that.
C: DUNCAN
D: Why not?
C: ELAINE
D: Because we're... moving in together. Duncan looks over at Oscar, who looks like he's just seen a ghost. He's struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who's doing his best to look after him.
C: DUNCAN
D: Are you crazy?
C: ELAINE
D: Dad, this isn't actually what he's like. He took some drugs and--
C: DUNCAN
D: Drugs?! Is he on the pipe?
N: Jeff looks over, his eyes pleading with Elaine not to tell on him.
C: ELAINE
D: No he's not on the pipe. He took some Valium and had a.bad reaction. Jeff looks grateful.
C: DUNCAN
D: Valium?! That's not a Valium high. Your mother was on Valium for forty years. She never knocked over a coffin.
C: ELAINE
D: Dad, please.
C: DUNCAN
D: I just want to point out that you won't see Derek knocking over a coffin.
C: ELAINE
D: Not right now, Dad.
C: DUNCAN
D: Fine. I've got to check on Cynthia, but this isn't over. Duncan walks back to the house. Elaine walks over to Oscar who is hugging a tree.
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar.
C: OSCAR
D: Elaine.
C: ELAINE
D: Come and sit down.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Aaron talks to a mourner. Norman comes up and hugs him.
C: NORMAN
D: Are you alright?... That was insane. He just fell out the coffin like a dead fish. I guess its not much of a metaphor when you're talking about a dead human, but--
N: Death at a Funeral 02/6/0.9 49. Aaron looks at Norman.
C: AARON
D: Norman, please.
C: NORMAN
D: Oh yeah... Sorry. It's just that you never know when it's your time. Like, I have this weird thing on my wrist. I've had it for a few weeks now. I don't know what it is--
C: AARON
D: Why don't you show it to my Uncle Duncan? He's a doctor.
C: NORMAN
D: He is? Great. Thanks. Norman walks off toward the kitchen. He passes Uncle Russell and Ryan talking to Martina.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: I read your last book, "Black Hurt."
C: RYAN
D: Good, good. Thanks a lot.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: I'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard. What a load of bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with it. Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell.
S: EXT. BACK GARDEN - SITTING AREA - DAY
N: Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are standing together.
C: OSCAR
D: I swear it was moving. I must be losing my mind... Why are my hands so big?!
E: looks at his hands
C: ELAINE
D: Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell you something... Elaine sits him down on the bench.
C: OSCAR
D: What is it?
C: ELAINE
D: Now... You remember I gave you some Valium earlier?
C: OSCAR
D: Yes.
C: ELAINE
D: Well it turns out that it wasn't actually Valium. Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the background.
C: ELAINE
D: Can you hear me?
E: CONT'D
N: OSCAR (YELLS) Hello?
S: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: Cynthia is being comforted by her friends and Duncan. Norman enters and beckons Duncan over to the side.
C: NORMAN
D: Hello, Doctor, I know this is a bad time, but I've got this thing on my hand. I've had it for weeks now... Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously.
C: NORMAN
D: What do you think it is? Cynthia stands up.
E: CONT'D

C: DUNCAN
D: I don't know. It looks like some kind of pigment mutation. Duncan walks further out of the room.

C: DUNCAN
D: You're probably just allergic to something. Maybe from shellfish, nuts... Duncan heads further out of the room, but Norman won't give up.

C: SEEING OF--
D: Frank gives Aaron a knowing look.
C: AARON
D: How did you know my father? Aaron looks around the room. There is a copy of "People Magazine" sexiest men issue on the table. He sees figurines of male ballet dancers. It's getting clearer. He sees three Robert Mapplethorpe photos on the wall. There's a signed Kathy Griffin 8x10. Frank looks around waiting for him to get it. Aaron looks at a framed movie poster for Australia with Hugh Jackman. Aaron looks back at the picture. He gets it.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: Oh God... Aaron jumps up and closes the study door.
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK

C: AARON
D: Does my mother know?
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK
D: No. And there's no reason why she should... Just as long as I get what's owed to me.
N: A long pause. Aaron looks over at Frank.
C: AARON
D: "What's owed to you"?
N: FRANK . Well, obviously I should get something... I mean, your dad and I were lovers, and he left me absolutely nothing in his will. How do you think that makes me feel? Aaron fails to respond, because he's in too much shock.
C: FRANK
D: I'll tell you how it makes me feel cheap. Like some cheap piece of ass... I mean, I'm entitled to something.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: What do you want?
C: FRANK
D: What I want is a lot, but I'm not asking you for what I want. I deserve thirty thousand dollars.

D: Thirty thousand dollars?! I can't just give you thirty thousand dollars. My wife and I are trying to have kids--
C: FRANK
D: Your father told me you were having trouble...
N: (BEAT) Look, your father promised to take care of me, and I made sacrifices to keep him happy. Aaron gets angry.
C: AARON
D: You think you can come in here, slander my father's name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see "Dreamgirls"? I saw "Dreamgirls" twice. I'm not gay. That's not proof of anything... "Steppin' to the bad side / Gonna take a mean ride."
N: Aaron grabs Frank and pushes him against the wall.
C: AARON
D: I'm not giving you anything but a-- Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face. Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture.

D: What? No, no, no.
C: AARON
D: The guy in the leather jacket just showed me pictures of him and Dad together.
C: RYAN
D: No, no, no. I don't believe that. My father is not gay. I've known him my whole life. And he's the most non-gay man I've ever met. Matter fact, he's so straight he makes me seem gay. And I know I'm not gay-- Aaron pulls out the picture.

D: It sounds serious, doesn't it?
C: DEREK
D: What?

C: NORMAN
D: I can't not eat the cake. That's what I do when I'm stressed. I eat cake.
C: DEREK
D: I bet you won't eat it when your arm falls off. Norman sniffs the cake.
C: NORMAN
D: Will you just try it and tell me if there's nuts in it?
C: DEREK

D: Come on.
C: DEREK
D: I don't want to.

D: You think so?' I mean, there are a lot of fine ones up in heaven. Anna Nicole Smith's dead too, you know. might be watching over her. Norman sits next to Cynthia.
C: NORMAN
D: Death is a terrible thing... Did you check to make sure he.was wearing shoes? I hear they steal the shoes. And I hope you took off his ring, 'cause if it's worth anything, someone is going to take that, too. Cynthia stares at Norman.

C: AARON
D: I have not been living off of them... I've been living with them.

C: FRANK
D: Fine by me. Aaron is now extremely irritated. He exchanges a look with Ryan confirming that there's no other way out.
N: AARON (TO FRANK) If I write this check, then that's it. You give us the photos and stay away from our mother. Deal?

C: FRANK
D: No, nothing. Aaron continues to write the check.

D: Don't you think I know that?
C: ELAINE
D: I'm sorry. At least your husband didn't ruin the funeral.
C: MICHELLE
D: It's a funeral, it's already ruined. When you start off with a dead guest of honor, how much worse can it get?
S: INT. STUDY - DAY
N: Ryan and Aaron struggle with Frank, who's muffled cries are
T: starting to fade.
C: RYAN
D: Get that tie. Aaron grabs the necktie from off the desk.
C: AARON
D: What am I supposed to do with the tie?
C: RYAN
D: Whatever you do with a tie.
C: AARON
D: I don't know what to--
C: RYAN
D: Just stuff it in his mouth! Damn, I have to do everything?
C: AARON

N: Suddenly the door opens and Norman enters.
C: NORMAN
D: Aaron, do you know what was in this cake, I- ANGLE ON: Frank who looks at Norman bug eyed hoping he'll help.
C: RYAN
D: Shut the goddamn door! Shocked, Norman does as he's told. It takes Norman a moment to register that Aaron and Ryan are sitting on top of Frank. Frank continues screaming through the cloth.
C: NORMAN
D: What is going on? Who is that guy? Ryan thinks quickly.
C: RYAN
D: He's having a seizure.
C: NORMAN
D: I just found some Valium outside. Would that help?
C: RYAN
D: Yeah. Great. Give him some. Frank shakes his head "no." Norman gets on his knees with the guys and opens the bottle.
C: NORMAN
D: It's okay. This should help. calm you down. Frank tries to protest, but can't. Ryan holds Frank's mouth open as Aaron holds his nose closed. Norman pours a few pills into Frank's mouth, then Ryan holds Frank's mouth shut. Suddenly the door opens again and Jeff walks in.
C: JEFF
D: Have you seen a little brown pill bottle lying around-- They all turn to Jeff. Frank looks at him, hoping this time he'll get saved.
C: RYAN
D: Norman! I told you to lock the damn door.
C: NORMAN
D: You said "shut the damn door." Jeff locks the door and looks shocked.
C: JEFF
D: What's going on?
C: NORMAN
D: He's having a seizure.

S: INT. STUDY - DAY
N: Jeff, Aaron, Ryan and Norman are all kneeling over Frank.
C: JEFF
D: He's blackmailing you? Over what?
C: AARON
D: If I could tell everybody, it wouldn't be blackmail.
C: RYAN
D: Look, just trust us. He's the bad guy. We'll explain later.
C: NORMAN
D: What are you going to do with him? Everyonerealizes they have no answer to this question.
C: AARON
D: Yeah, Ryan, what are we going to do with him? Ryan doesn't have any answers.
C: RYAN
D: I don't know.
C: AARON
D: You don't know?! Come on, you're the big writer. You're the one who came up with "Black Hurt." Dream up something where we all live happily ever after. We can't keep him tied up forever. How long do you think those Valium are going to last?
C: JEFF
D: Valium?
C: NORMAN
D: Yeah, I found that bottle of Valium. We gave him a few to calm him down. Norman hands him the bottle.
C: JEFF
D: Ah shit! Jeff stands up and heads over to the door.
C: AARON
D: What?
N: FRANK (MUFFLED) What? They all head over to Jeff. Frank looks extremely curious to know what's going on. Everyone talks very quietly so that Frank can't hear.
C: RYAN
D: What is it?
C: JEFF
D: The thing is... those pills aren't really Valium. It's acid and... acid.
C: AARON
D: What?!
C: JEFF
D: Oscar took one by mistake. That's why he's acting crazy.
C: AARON
D: Jeff, what the hell are you doing with this stuff?
C: JEFF

C: AARON
D: What friend, Amy Winehouse?
C: RYAN
D: Wait, you're telling us that Elaine's boyfriend, who knocked over our father's coffin, had just one of these things...
N: AARON (TO NORMAN) And you gave him how many? Norman looks a bit guilty.
C: NORMAN
D: Five.
C: JEFF
D: Five?! Poor bastard.
E: looking at Frank
C: NORMAN
D: I thought they were Valium. They all turn and look at Frank who is looking back at them, increasingly concerned by whatever conversation they are having, and the pitying expressions on their faces.
C: AARON
D: Maybe we should call an ambulance.
C: JEFF
D: You can't do that. I'll go to jail.
C: RYAN
D: He's right. If anyone finds out this guy's been force fed acid, we could all be arrested.
C: AARON
D: So what then? What's going to happen? Is he going to die?!
C: JEFF
D: No... I don't think so... I doubt it.. Probably not...

E: to Norman and Jeff
C: NORMAN
D: Watch him?! What do you mean, "watch him"?
C: RYAN

C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Lookie here, brother. I've been patient. We all know it's a virtue, but I'm about done with patience. Now if we don't resume service soon, we're going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation.
C: AARON
D: Sure. So sorry. Um... can you just give us another five minutes? The reverend doesn't look too pleased.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Five minutes.
C: CYNTHIA

S: INT. GARAGE - DAY
N: Aaron and Ryan enter and slam the door.

S: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: We hear their muffled argument through the door. Uncle Russell rolls up to Derek who is sitting at the kitchen table.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: What's your problem?!
C: DEREK
D: Women are my problem.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: No such thing as having a woman without a problem. If they didn't have problems, do you think they'd let us touch 'em? Let me tell you something about women. Smarter than you think they are. But not as smart as they think they are.
C: DEREK
D: She acts like she doesn't care that I exist. I mean how can she not feel what I feel?
N: UNCLE RUSSELL (LAUGHS) Oh she feels it. She's playing hard to get. She wants you to work for it. Look, let me tell something about women. They want a man who can control them. I know they talk all this Oprah, Beyonce "single women" BS, but what they really want is an old school man.
C: DEREK
D: Really?
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Listen here, boy. This is what you do: you walk up to her, slap her--
C: DEREK
D: Slap her? You want me to hit her?
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Has not hitting her worked? Look, then you grab her and kiss her. The harder the better.
C: DEREK
D: Are you sure, 'cause that--
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Oh, man, I gotta shit. Where's the can? He rolls away quickly.
S: INT. STUDY - DAY
N: Norman and Jeff are sitting in the study. Frank is on the floor tied up, breathing heavily and making gurgling sounds.
C: JEFF
D: I can't believe you gave him five. Even if they were Valium, that's too many. I wouldn't give a guy five cough drops. Suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle. Norman and Jeff both look terrified.
N: FRANK (MUFFLED) Hello? Jeff covers his mouth.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Hello?! Neither Norman nor Jeff want to speak. They argue in gestures. Finally Jeff relents.
E: O.S.

C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: I'm in a wheelchair, you idiot! How am I supposed to get up the stairs?!

D: Open the damn door! Uncle Russell starts banging on the door with his cane.
E: O.S.
C: NORMAN
D: What are we going to do? They look at Frank who's starting to look high as a kite.
C: JEFF
D: We'll stick him behind the couch.
N: NORMAN (CALLS OUT) Just looking for the key. They pick Frank up and dump him behind the couch. Jeff stays with Frank to keep him quiet as Norman opens the door. Uncle Russell wheels himself inside.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: What the hell is wrong with you people? I'm about to take a dump in my pants!

C: DEREK
D: I just want to talk.
C: ELAINE
D: Please don't make me go through this again.
C: DEREK
D: The only reason you don't want to go out with me is because your dad likes me.
C: ELAINE
D: No. The reason I don't want to go out with you is because it was a mistake. I was drunk off my ass. You could have been a donkey.
C: DEREK
D: Thanks.
C: ELAINE
D: That wasn't a compliment. I'm saying I couldn't remember it.
C: DEREK
D: Well I remember every minute of it.
C: ELAINE
D: A minute, huh? That's why I don't remember.
C: DEREK
D: What is it about this guy? What has he got that I haven't got?
C: ELAINE
D: Okay, well for one thing, he's responsible. He's caring. He's considerate. He's thoughtful. He's stable. He's--

S: INT. GARAGE DAY
N: Aaron and Ryan are still arguing.
C: AARON
D: I'm not the one who tied him up.
C: RYAN
D: Well somebody had to look out for Mom.
N: AARON (INCENSED) I've been looking out for Mom since you got your book deal.
C: RYAN
D: You just can't get over it, can you? You're burning with jealousy because I left and did what you always wanted to do.
C: AARON
D: I couldn't leave because I had responsibilities.
C: RYAN
D: Don't put it off on responsibilities. You spent three years on a novel and you won't even let anyone see it! What are you going to do? Wait until you're dead? You think you're going to be the Tupac of books?
C: AARON
D: At least I'm not some hack writing crap. Mr. "Mama's Secret", Mr. "Black Hurt."
C: RYAN
D: Mr. "Out of Ink", Mr. "Blank Page." At least my crap gets published. Michelle enters.
C: MICHELLE
D: Aaron, what is going on?
C: AARON
D: Michelle, please, not now.
C: MICHELLE
D: Why are you acting like this? Fine. We don't have to have sex today, but the condo? Don't you want to get out of here?
N: AARON MICHELLE--
C: RYAN
D: Just tell her, Aaron.
C: MICHELLE
D: Tell me what? Aaron closes the garage door.
C: AARON
D: Listen... Do you remember the guy in the leather jacket?
C: MICHELLE
D: Yeah.
C: AARON
D: Well, I don't know how to say this, but... it looks like he and my father were having sex.
C: MICHELLE
D: What? No. Not your father. With him?
C: AARON
D: Yes.
C: MICHELLE
D: No. Your father was the straightest guy I know.
C: RYAN
D: That's what I thought.
C: MICHELLE
D: Are you sure?
C: AARON
D: And now he wants thirty thousand dollars or he's going to show everyone photos of them doing... stuff...

C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Pants down. Pants down.

S: INT. STUDY - SAME TIME
N: Frank peeks up from behind the couch. He's clearly high. With his hands still tied, he struggles to get to his feet.

C: NORMAN
D: What? Jeff points to his face.
C: JEFF

He cracks his head on the corner and falls straight down. Jeff and Norman rush out of the bathroom to find Frank lying on the floor motionless, blood on his head.

D: What's his name?
C: NORMAN
D: I don't know. Try Larry. Jeff looks at Norman, but he doesn't have a better idea.
C: JEFF
D: Larry?
C: NORMAN
D: Shake him. Jeff bends down and shakes him.
C: JEFF
D: Larry, wake up. It's time to get up. From the bathroom, Uncle Russell starts to stir. Norman quickly closes the door.
C: NORMAN
D: Maybe it's not Larry. Try something else. Pinch him. Jeff pinches Frank. Still no response.
C: NORMAN
D: He must be breathing. He has to be breathing. Please God let him be breathing.

D: Well, it's not that simple.
C: MICHELLE
D: Why not?
C: RYAN
D: Aaron refused to pay.
C: MICHELLE
D: How come you couldn't pay, Ryan?
C: RYAN
D: That's not the point. Besides, the only reason Aaron tore up the check is because the guy started talking bad about his novel.
C: MICHELLE
D: Your novel? Michelle looks confused.
C: MICHELLE
D: You let him read your novel? You wouldn't let me read your novel. Are you screwing him, too? 'Cause Lord knows you're not screwing me.

C: NORMAN
D: Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Pardon me. Hi. The hugesmile never leaves his face. ANGLE ON: Ryan, Aaron and Michelle watching Norman, concerned. Norman approaches and stands on the other side of the coffin.
C: AARON
D: Norman, why are you grinning like that?
C: NORMAN
D: Can you come to the study for a second? Aaron can see from Norman's face, and the sweat on his forehead, that something serious has happened. Then he sees Cynthia sitting in the corner.
E: to Aaron and Ryan
N: AARON (TO MICHELLE) I'll be back soon. Can you check on Mom?

C: AARON
D: Pull yourself together! Norman calms down.
C: NORMAN
D: Thanks, man. After a beat, Ryan speaks.
C: RYAN
D: Look, no one here knows who this guy is. Nobody knows his name. They probably didn't even notice him.
C: AARON
D: Didn't notice him? He's four fucking feet tall.
C: RYAN
D: Look, all we have to do is get rid of the body. It'll be like he came and left.
C: AARON
D: Get rid of the body?! It took me two months to get rid of a couch.
C: JEFF
D: Did any of you happen to notice the size of Uncle Edward's coffin? Everyone looks at Jeff.
N: AARON (TO JEFF) You want to bury him with my father?
C: JEFF
D: Why not?... I mean it's not like he's going to know.
C: AARON
D: That's not the point.
C: RYAN
D: You have to admit, it makes sense, Aaron. The coffin's there, the hole in the ground's there... He'll be gone, finished, end of story... Unless you have a better suggestion. Aaron desperately tries to think of an alternative.

C: ELAINE
D: You're an idiot.
C: DEREK
D: I'm serious. You only live once. You might as well do whatever it is that makes you happy.
C: ELAINE
D: Yes, but maybe I don't think of life anymore as all about me, me, me. Maybe I've discovered there's something outside of myself that I care about. And maybe you should, too. Derek looks hurt.
C: DEREK
D: That's kind of cold. I care about you.
C: ELAINE
D: No, Derek, you care about you. You only care about me in relation to how I affect you. There's a difference.

N: (MOCKING) Aaron's so great, Aaron's so right, Aaron's so responsible. (back to normal) Why don't you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while? It might make you a better a writer.

S: EXT. ROOF - DAY

C: ELAINE
D: Look, Dad--
C: DUNCAN
D: Elaine, stay out of this.
C: ELAINE
D: No, I'm not staying out of this. Remember how I told you we were moving in together? Well, I lied. We're getting married. Duncan is shocked.
C: DUNCAN
D: You're what?!
C: ELAINE
D: We're getting married.
C: DUNCAN
D: Elaine, you don't have to marry him just because you're pregnant.
C: ELAINE
D: I'm not marrying him because I'm pregnant. I'm marrying him because I love him.
C: DUNCAN
D: How can you love him? He's an idiot.
C: ELAINE
D: Dad, this is my life. If you don't like it, too bad. But if you want to keep me and my child in your life, you'd better change your attitude, especially about my husband.
N: Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her.

D: What the hell is going on in this place?
C: AARON
D: I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There was someone on the roof--
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: Never mind that. What about that dead body you dragged in here? Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance.

C: DEREK
D: How's your skin thing?
E: CONT'D
C: NORMAN
D: Oh that... It's probably nothing. I'm more worried about Hepatitis C after having Uncle Russell's shit in my mouth. I think I'm feeling yellow. Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek confused. ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He gives up and sits in a chair. ANGLE ON: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron moves to his seat.
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was dead!
C: RYAN
D: I know you did, Russell. We all did.

C: AARON
D: I can't believe what a nightmare today has been.

C: AARON
D: Listen, about the condo and the baby,
N: I PROMISE--
C: MICHELLE
D: We'll work it out. Let's just get this day over with. Then we can worry about the rest of our lives. Aaron hugs Michelle.
C: AARON
D: I can't believe I still have to do this eulogy... with everything I've just found out. A beat.
C: MICHELLE
D: It doesn't change anything, does it?
C: AARON
D: Not a thing. Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and appearing flustered.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: We're going to have to fly through this now. I already missed a funeral and two Christenings.
C: AARON
D: Sure. Let's go.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Do you want an open casket?
C: AARON/RYAN/NORMAN/JEFF
D: No! The reverend looks shocked at the reaction, but ignores it. She stands up at the front and speaks quickly.
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: Alright! Everybody in their seats now! Hey, you, sit down. People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her.
E: she snaps her fingers
C: REVEREND DAVIS
D: I'd like to apologize on behalf of the family for all of the distractions. I hope that everyone is settled and ready to continue with the service. Aaron, the oldest son, would like to say a few words about his father. Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to the front. Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath. ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up. ANGLE ON: Aaron.
E: CONT'D speaking very quickly
C: AARON
D: My father... was an exceptional--
C: BANG! BANG! BANG!
D: Suddenly, a loud banging emanates from the coffin. Everyone stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks over to Norman whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a deer caught in headlights. He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to continue. He nervously struggles on.
C: AARON
D: My father was an exceptional man.
E: CONT'D
C: BANG! BANG! BANG!
D: Everyone stares at the coffin in awe. Aaron bravely continues.
C: AARON
D: Not only did he live for his family, but he was always there for others--
E: CONT'D
N: BANG! BANG! BANG!
C: DUNCAN
D: What the hell is going on?
N: MOURNER 1 There's someone in there!
C: OSCAR
D: I knew it! I knew it! Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling incoherently. Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin and looks at his dead lover.
C: RYAN
D: What the hell are you doing in my Dad's coffin? Frank starts grabbing at Edward's body screaming.
E: trying to cover
C: FRANK
D: Edward! Edward! Edward! Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but he's holding onto the corpse.
C: FRANK
D: No! No! Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet. As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs at Frank.
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: You bastard! Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him.
C: CYNTHIA
D: He was with you! Duncan picks up the photos. He shows them to Uncle Russell.
E: CONT'D as she hits him
C: UNCLE RUSSELL
D: I always thought he had a little sugar in his tank. Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron finally shouts across the room.
N: AARON MY FATHER WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN!!! Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned. They all freeze. There's a long silence.
C: AARON
D: He had his... shortcomings, but he took care of his family. He loved his family. He loved this house. He worked hard. All I wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired him. To give him the respect that he deserved... Is that really so much to ask? We all get so distracted by the... little things in life. We forget about the important things. Like the fact that we lost a great man. The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more than most men. We don't know why a man makes the choices he makes. But I do know that my father made the best choices he could make. Life is complicated. We're just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and confusion... and we do our best. And Dad did his best... Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by Aaron's words.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON
D: He taught us to go for what we wanted in life, because you never know how long you're going to be here... And whether you succeed... or you fail... the important thing is that you tried.
E: CONT'D
N: A beat. Michelle looks up at her husband with pride. We see the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening.
C: AARON
D: So when you all leave here today, I want you to remember Dad for who he really was... A decent, loving man who never condemned anyone for how they lived. Who never cast disparaging remarks or held prejudices against race, gender... height. If only we could all be as giving, as generous, as understanding as my father... Even dead, my father has more character than everyone in this room. If I am half the man my father was, my child will be incredibly blessed. Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go. Michelle follows him out of the room.
E: CONT'D
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: EXT. HOUSE - ESTABLISHING SHOT
N: The house has emptied out. All the cars are gone.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER - EVENING
N: Aaron is laying on the couch, looking drained. Ryan comes down the stairs. It looks like he's had some time to recover. He walks over and takes a seat.
C: AARON
D: How's Mom?
C: RYAN
D: She's resting. A beat.
C: RYAN
D: I've asked Mom to come live with me for awhile. It'll give you and Michelle a chance to breathe a bit, you know. Move and everything.
E: CONT'D
N: Aaron looks at Ryan, surprised.
