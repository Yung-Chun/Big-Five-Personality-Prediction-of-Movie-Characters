M: THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
T: FADE IN:
N: BRASS PLAQUE - DAY Engraved on it are the words: COX & CO., Bankers. Reflected in its shiny surface are double-decker red buses, and other present-day London traffic.
S: INT. BANK VAULT - DAY
N: An iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in. One of them switches on the lights. On the shelves which line the walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrapped packages, etc. The guards move along the shelves searching for something.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it. It is not to be opened until fifty years after my death.
N: The guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., painted on it. They remove it from the shelf, set it down on a table. The box is tied with heavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. Strung on the cord is the key.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: It contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art -- the world's first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting detective.
N: While one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts the cord with a pair of scissors. He then inserts the key in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealing the dusty contents of the box. OVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE THE MAIN TITLE. The guards now start to remove the objects from the box, one at a time: -- A daguerreotype of Holmes, standing, and Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes' deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass; Watson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamel sign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs; a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a violin piece composed by Holmes, titled FOR ILSE von H.; A pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a photograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearing the initials S.H. -- under which is concealed a compass; a worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-model hypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken, produces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we see a bust of Queen Victoria. OVER THESE OBJECTS, THE REST OF THE CREDIT TITLES ARE SUPERIMPOSED. The last item out of the box is a thick stack of manuscript paper, bound with green ribbon. The guard undoes the ribbon, dusts off the top page, as CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER. Written in ink, in the cursive penmanship of the period, is the following paragraph: To my heirs: In my lifetime, I have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes -- dealing with everything from The Hound of the Baskervilles to his mysterious brother Mycroft and the devilish Professor Moriarty. But there were other adventures which, for reasons of discretion, I have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date. They involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature, as will shortly become apparent. OVER THIS, WE HEAR THE VOICE OF DR. WATSON, reading the text.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: YORKSHIRE LANDSCAPE - DAY A passenger train of the late Nineteenth Century is chugging through the early morning mist.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: It was August of 1887, and we were returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes had solved the baffling murder of Colonel Abernetty.
S: INT. COMPARTMENT - MOVING TRAIN - DAWN
N: There are but two passengers in the compartment -- sitting by the window, facing each other. In fact they are dozing. One wears a deerstalker and an Inverness cape; the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler, a furled umbrella between his legs, a medical bag on the seat beside him. The rest of their luggage is on the racks above. They are, of course, SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JOHN H. WATSON. This being 1887, they are thirty- three and thirty-five respectively.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: You may recall that he broke the murderer's alibi by measuring the depth to which the parsley had sunk in the butter on a hot day.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY
N: A hansom cab, with Holmes' and Watson's luggage strapped to the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: He was the most brilliant man I have ever known -- and I dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat with him in Baker Street.
N: The cab draws up in front of 221B. The front door opens and MRS. HUDSON, a plump, motherly woman in her fifties, wearing an apron, hurries down the steps. She greets Holmes and Watson warmly as they alight.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: I'll grant you he was stimulating -- but he could also be moody, unpredictable, egocentric, and more often than not, completely infuriating -- as our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest -- bless her kind soul.
N: The cabbie starts to unload their luggage. As Holmes, Watson and Mrs. Hudson proceed inside, CAMERA TRAVELS UP THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING, past the number 221B, to the bay window on the second floor.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
N: It's all there -- the fireplace, the coal scuttle, the Persian slipper with the tobacco; the velvet wing chair, the basket chair with the writing-arm, the couch with the cushions; the sideboard with the tantalus and the gasogene; the acid-stained deal-topped table with Holmes' chemical equipment on it, the dining table, the small Moorish table; the bookshelves and the violin case; the gas fixtures and the oil lamps; the dumbwaiter connecting with the kitchen in the basement; and Holmes' desk, piled high with papers, clippings, research material, etc. Holmes is pulling up the window shades. Watson has removed his hat and coat, and is putting his medical bag down on the sideboard; the cabbie, having deposited their luggage, is just leaving.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: I do wish you'd give me a little more warning when you come home unexpected. I would have roasted a goose -- and had some flowers for you.
C: HOLMES
D: My dear Mrs. Hudson -- criminals are as unpredictable as head-colds. You never quite know when you're going to catch one.
N: He has picked up a dagger, starts opening his mail, which is on the dining table.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: I'll unpack your bags.
N: She exits into one of the bedrooms. Watson has now taken a magazine out of an envelope.
C: WATSON
D: Here's an advance copy of Strand Magazine. They've printed 'The Red-Headed League!'
E: shows it to Holmes
N: On the cover is a colored illustration from the story, featuring in obligatory Inverness and deerstalker.
C: HOLMES
D: Very impressive.
E: offhand
C: WATSON
D: Would you like to see how I treated it?
E: leafing through the magazine
C: HOLMES
D: I can hardly wait. I'm sure I'll find out all sorts of fascinating things about the case that I never knew before.
C: WATSON
D: Just what do you mean by that?
C: HOLMES
D: Oh, come now, Watson, you must admit that you have a tendency to over-romanticize. You have taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them, exaggerated them...
C: WATSON
D: I deny the accusation.
C: HOLMES
D: You have described me as six-foot-four, whereas I am barely six-foot-one.
C: WATSON
D: A bit of poetic license.
C: HOLMES
D: You have saddled me with this improbable costume, which the public now expects me to wear.
E: removing Inverness and deerstalker
C: WATSON
D: That's not my doing. Blame it on the illustrator.
E: indicating cover of Strand
C: HOLMES
D: You've made me out to be a violin virtuoso. Here --
N: (holds out a letter he's been reading) -- a request from the Liverpool Symphony to appear as soloist in the Mendelssohn Concerto.
C: WATSON
D: Oh, really?
E: excited
C: HOLMES
D: The fact is that I could barely hold my own in the pit orchestra of a second-rate music hall.
C: WATSON
D: You're much too modest.
C: HOLMES
D: You have given the reader the distinct impression that I am a misogynist. Actually, I don't dislike women -- I merely distrust them. The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup.
E: busy with the mail
C: WATSON
D: It's those little touches that make you colorful --
C: HOLMES
D: Lurid is more like it. You have painted me as a hopeless dope addict -- just because I occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine.
C: WATSON
D: A seven per cent solution.
C: HOLMES
D: Five per cent. Don't you think I'm aware you've been diluting it behind my back?
C: WATSON
D: As a doctor -- and as your friend -- I strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours.
C: HOLMES
D: My dear friend -- as well as my dear doctor -- I only resort to narcotics when I am suffering from acute boredom -- when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind. Look at this -- an urgent appeal to find six missing midgets.
E: holding out one of the open letters
N: He tosses the letter down is disgust.
C: WATSON
D: Did you say midgets?
N: He picks up the letter.
C: HOLMES
D: Six of them -- the Tumbling Piccolos -- an acrobatic act with some circus.
C: WATSON
D: Disappeared between London and Bristol ... Don't you find that intriguing?
C: HOLMES
D: Extremely so. You see, they are not only midgets -- but also anarchists.
C: WATSON
D: Anarchists?
C: HOLMES
D: By now they have been smuggled to Vienna, dressed as little girls in burgundy pinafores. They are to greet the Czar of all the Russias when he arrives at the railway station. They will be carrying bouquets of flowers, concealed in each bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse.
E: nodding
C: WATSON
D: You really think so?
C: HOLMES
D: Not at all. The circus owner offers me five pounds for my services -- that's not even a pound a midget.
N: So obviously he is a stingy blighter, and the little chaps simply ran off to join another circus.
C: WATSON
D: Oh. And it sounded so promising --
E: crestfallen
C: HOLMES
D: There are no great crimes anymore, Watson. The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality. At best they commit some bungling villainy, with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.
N: He has crossed to the desk, suddenly notices something.
C: HOLMES
D: Mrs. Hudson! MRS. HUDSON!
E: angrily even angrier
N: Mrs. Hudson comes hurrying out of the bedroom.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Yes? What is it? What have I done now?
C: HOLMES
D: There is something missing from my desk.
E: sternly
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Missing?
C: HOLMES
D: Something very crucial. You have been tidying up against my explicit orders.
E: picks up a small feather
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Oh, I made sure not to disturb anything.
C: HOLMES
D: Dust, Mrs. Hudson, is an essential part of my filing system. By the thickness of it, I can date any document immediately.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Some of the dust was this thick.
N: She demonstrates with her thumb and forefinger.
C: HOLMES
D: That would be March, 1883.
E: promptly
N: He blows the feather away.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
N: START on Holmes' foot, operating a bellows. CAMERA PANS UP to the top of the chemistry table, on which an elaborate apparatus of brass, glass and rubber tubing has been set up. Inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes are half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of different shapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit. Activated by the bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezing loudly and filling the screen with smoke. Seated at the table is Holmes, in shirt-sleeves. Occasionally he knocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under a microscope. Watson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair with the writing arm, documenting the latest Holmes adventure for Strand Magazine. The open mail has now been affixed to the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger. Mrs. Hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table, and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter. The accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: How can you stand this? Why don't you let me air the room out?
C: WATSON
D: Please, Mrs. Hudson -- he's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: I'm sure there's a crying need for that.
E: drily
C: WATSON
D: In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar. Sor far he has classified 140 different kinds of ashes.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: All of which will end up on my rug.
N: She is now pulling on the rope which lowers the dumbwaiter.
C: WATSON
D: That'll be enough, Mrs. Hudson.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: All right. If you gentlemen want to stay here and suffocate...
E: heading for door
N: She exits, shutting the door. For a while, the two go on working. Then Holmes rises abruptly from the chemistry table.
C: HOLMES
D: She's right. I am suffocating.
C: WATSON
D: Let me open a window.
C: HOLMES
D: Not from lack of air -- from lack of activity. Sitting here week after week -- blowing smoke rings -- staring through a microscope -- there's no challenge in that.
C: WATSON
D: Personally, I consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology...
N: Holmes has opened his violin case and taken out his fiddle.
C: HOLMES
D: How I envy you your mind, Watson.
C: WATSON
D: You do?
C: HOLMES
D: It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic. But my mind rebels against stagnation. It's like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built.
N: He has tucked the violin under his chin, starts to improvise a nervous pent-up melody. There is nothing amateurish about it -- he plays quite well. Watson resumes working on his manuscript. Suddenly the music stops. Watson looks up apprehensively. Holmes has put down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard. He opens Watson's medical bag, takes out a bottle of cocaine, starts toward his bedroom. Watson pushes the writing arm to the side, rises from his chair.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes --
N: Holmes pays no attention, continues into the bedroom. Watson crosses to the open door. Inside the bedroom, Holmes has put down the cocaine bottle on the washstand, and is rolling up his left sleeve.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, where is your self-control?
C: HOLMES
D: Fair question.
N: From a drawer he takes a morocco case, opens it, removes a hypodermic syringe.
C: WATSON
D: Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
C: HOLMES
D: Thoroughly. But this will take care of it.
N: He has removed the stopper from the cocaine bottle, and inserting the hypodermic needle into it, starts to draw up the liquid.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY
N: It is raining. A bus comes down the street, the open top deck sprouting umbrellas like black mushrooms.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: Naturally, I don't mean to imply that my friend was always on cocaine -- sometimes it was opium, sometimes it was hashish. And once he went one of these dreadful binges, there was no telling how long it would last.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
N: Rain beats on the windows. Holmes and Watson are in the middle of an argument.
C: WATSON
D: The only reason you moved in with me is to have a steady supply of stimulants.
C: HOLMES
D: Now, now, Watson -- you mustn't underestimate your other charms.
N: He starts into the bedroom.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, I warn you. If you lock yourself in there once more --
C: HOLMES
D: I intend to do nothing of the sort.
N: He takes the hypodermic out of the drawer in the washstand, starts back into the living room with it.
C: HOLMES
D: Not until you replace this needle. It is getting rather blunt.
N: As Watson glares at him, the door opens and Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in. Holmes hides the hypodermic behind his back.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: I made you some tea and cress sandwiches.
N: She opens the door of the dumbwaiter, starts to pull it up.
C: WATSON
D: Mrs. Hudson, I want you to pack my bags.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Are you going away for the weekend?
C: WATSON
D: And beyond. I'm moving out.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Moving out?
E: she looks at Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: I'm just as surprised as you are.
C: WATSON
D: You heard me, Mrs. Hudson. And let's not waste any time.
N: Mrs. Hudson sighs, exits into Watson's bedroom.
C: HOLMES
D: May I be so bold as to ask where you'er going?
C: WATSON
D: I don't know yet. But I intend to resume my practice. I am, after all, a doctor. And quite a competent one, if I say so as shouldn't.
C: HOLMES
D: You'll find it very dull -- snipping out tonsils and flushing out kidneys --
N: Watson is glancing around the room, searching for something.
C: HOLMES
D: If you're looking for your medical bag, you hid it under the Moorish table. Which shows a little more imagination than last time -- when it was under your bed.
E: as Watson crosses to it
N: Watson picks up the Moorish table, disclosing the medical bag, standing on end. He sets the bag down on the fender, opens it.
C: WATSON
D: I will, of course, continue to pay my half of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you.
C: HOLMES
D: Where am I going to find anyone who will put up with my rather eccentric habits?
C: WATSON
D: Here's a fresh needle -- and here's my farewell present to you.
E: taking hypodermic needle out of bag
N: He takes out three bottles of narcotics, puts them on the mantel.
C: WATSON
D: If you want to destroy yourself, go right ahead. But I won't sit by and watch you doing it.
N: He snaps his bag shut, carries it toward his bedroom.
C: HOLMES
D: Watson...
N: Watson disappears into the bedroom, slamming the door. Holmes looks after him, then looks at the bottles of dope on the mantelpiece. He starts pacing. After a moment he stops at the chemistry table, studies the assorted glassware on the shelves above.
S: INT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: There are two open valises on the bed. Watson is moving around the room, collecting various odds and ends, while Mrs. Hudson packs his clothes.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: It's so sad. You and Mr. Holmes -- after all these years --
E: she sobs
C: WATSON
D: Please, Mrs. Hudson -- none of that.
N: Mrs. Hudson takes a clean handkerchief from the open valise, blows her nose.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: I'll wash this and send it on to you.
C: WATSON
D: I'll be at Brown's Hotel.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: I know how it feels -- I once went through a divorce myself.
E: still sniffling
C: WATSON
D: Actually, I'm rather looking forward to it. Leading a normal life again. Regular office hours -- nine to three -- and if occasionally there's an emergency call in the middle of the night, I know it's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder. Let Holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained collar-button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his behind --
E: removing diploma from wall
N: From the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot. Mrs. Hudson screams and Watson looks off in alarm. Then he races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed by Mrs. Hudson.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: As they burst into the room, they see Holmes sitting on the stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in his hand. He has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on the mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Mr. Holmes...
N: Holmes fires, smashing the second bottle. As Mrs. Hudson takes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun.
C: HOLMES
D: Please, Mrs. Hudson. You're in my line of fire.
N: Watson jerks Mrs. Hudson back as Holmes lets go with another shot. The bullet disposes of the third bottle, splattering glass and liquid all over the place. Holmes rises calmly from the stool, crosses to the desk, puts the revolver away in a drawer.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: How many times have I told you I will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises? I should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall.
E: outraged
N: She points up to a spot near the ceiling. Neatly traced in bullet holes are the initials V.R., with a small crown above them.
C: HOLMES
D: Merely celebrating Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Look at that mess you made --
N: Watson is looking at Holmes with a little smile on his face.
C: WATSON
D: It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean it up -- -- while you unpack my things.
E: hands her the diploma
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Unpack?
C: HOLMES
D: You heard him.
N: A bewildered Mrs. Hudson goes back into the bedroom. Watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroom and the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass.
C: WATSON
D: Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult it must've been for you --
C: HOLMES
D: Not really. It was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion.
C: WATSON
D: You've made me very happy.
C: HOLMES
D: I've often been accused of being cold and unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in my cold, unemotional way, I'm very fond of you, Watson.
C: WATSON
D: I know that. But one likes to hear these things occasionally.
N: He notices the violin, which has been splattered with the liquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up.
C: WATSON
D: Look at this. Covered with that nasty stuff. I'd better dry it off.
C: HOLMES
D: I'll do it.
N: He takes the instrument, and dabbing it with a handkerchief, carries it toward the violin case.
C: WATSON
D: For a moment, I was worried that you were going to let me walk out -- that you weren't even going to try to stop me.
C: HOLMES
D: Now, Watson -- you know there's nothing I wouldn't do to keep you here.
N: With a side-glance at the busy Watson, he opens the violin case. Neatly stashed away around the edges are the three original bottles of narcotics. The ones he shot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistry set. He places the violin carefully among the bottles, closes the case, snaps the locks. As he moves off, we STAY on the violin case.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: It was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that. Normally, I was inclined to forgive him...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Watson, in his dressing gown, is sitting at the table, finishing his coffee. In front of him is a letter, on blue note-paper, and a pair of theatre tickets.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: But on one occasion, he did something that was so utterly unforgivable, that I would gladly have murdered him -- had it not been for my saintly disposition.
N: Watson sets down his coffee cup, picks up the letter and the tickets, rises from his chair. He starts to pace -- addressing Holmes, who is off-scene.
C: WATSON
D: Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes? Why won't you go? It's the final performance of the Imperial Russian Ballet -- the house has been sold out for months --
N: He moves towards the door of -- HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAY Holmes is sitting in a hip-bath with a high back, soaping himself. Watson appears in the doorway.
C: WATSON
D: -- seats are going for a guinea apiece --
C: HOLMES
D: That's precisely it. Why should someone send up two free tickets? Anonymously, at that.
C: WATSON
D: Whoever sent them must be in great distress. The note says --
N: (reading it) 'Please! You are the only man in the world who can help me.'
C: HOLMES
D: I suspect it's some sort of plot.
C: WATSON
D: You mean somebody wants to lure us into a trap...?
C: HOLMES
D: Somebody wants to kill me.
C: WATSON
D: Kill you?
C: HOLMES
D: That's right. It's a plot to bore me to death. I detest ballet.
C: WATSON
D: But this isn't just any ballet. It's Swan Lake.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THEATRE - NIGHT
N: START ON THE CONDUCTOR, in the orchestra pit, as he gives the downbeat for the second acto music of SWAN LAKE. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE THE STAGE, with a mechanical sway crossing the mist-shrouded lake. CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK, REVEALING Holmes and Watson, in evening clothes, occupying a box in the upper tier.
C: WATSON
D: You know, of course, Holmes -- that swan isn't really a swan -- it's an enchanted princess.
E: confidentially
C: HOLMES
D: H'mmmm.
E: bored
N: On the stage now, the hunters appear, carrying lighted torches. BOX Watson trains his opera glasses on the stage, Holmes stifles a yawn. STAGE PETROVA, as the Queen of the Swans, makes her entrance to loud applause. She is in her forties, but splendidly preserved, undoubtedly the greatest ballerina around. BOX Watson nudges Holmes, who has dozed off.
C: WATSON
D: Fabulous woman, don't you think so, Holmes?
C: HOLMES
D: Who?
E: coming to
C: WATSON
D: The great Petrova.
N: He hands the glasses to Holmes, who focuses them indifferently on the stage. STAGE Petrova is making an exit, backwards, on points. BOX Holmes lowers the glasses, returns them to Watson.
C: HOLMES
D: Very strong arches, I must admit.
C: WATSON
D: They say twelve men have died for her.
C: HOLMES
D: Really.
C: WATSON
D: Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels, and one fell out of the gallery in the Vienna Opera House.
C: HOLMES
D: That's only eleven.
C: WATSON
D: The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra.
C: HOLMES
D: That makes an even dozen -- in a messy sort of way.
N: Watson resumes watching the stage through the glasses. STAGE Petrova and the dancer playing the Prince go into the famous pas-de-deux. BOX Watson enjoying himself immensely, Holmes sitting there dourly. The red plush curtain at the rear of the box parts, and a man in evening clothes and a top hat enters. He is in his middle fifties, extremely soigne, and somewhat sinister. His name is ROGOZHIN, and he is Russian. Holmes and Watson look around.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Mister Holmes?
C: HOLMES
D: Yes.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: I am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general of the Imperial Russian Ballet. So glad you accept invitation.
N: Holmes and Watson start to get up, but he motions them back into their chairs.
C: HOLMES
D: This is Dr. Watson.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Pleased to meet you. You are enjoying?
E: seating himself behind them
C: WATSON
D: Immensely.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Tell me, Mr. Holmes, how is your health?
E: abruptly
C: HOLMES
D: My health? Better consult my doctor.
C: WATSON
D: Oh, he's in excellent shape.
E: to Rogozhin
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Any insanity in your family? Diabetes? Asthma?
E: to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Certainly. Madame Petrova, she has problem.
C: HOLMES
D: Could you be more specific?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Certainly not.
C: WATSON
D: A liason with a crowned head? Compromising letters? Blackmail?
N: He glances toward the stage. STAGE The pas-de-deux finished, to a rousing ovation. BOX Rogozhin rises, turns to Holmes.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: After performance, there will be little celebration backstage -- and Madame requests your presence.
C: WATSON
D: We'd be delighted.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: You are invited, also.
E: to Watson
N: With a parting look he exits, pulling the plush curtains closed.
T: CUT TO:
N: STAGE The performance is over, the curtain is up, the party is on. Tables have been set up, with caviar, vodka and champagne. The members of the orchestra are now playing balalaikas, and crew and cast (the ballerinas still in costume, the male dancers in tights) seem in high spirits. Holmes and Watson, in silk hats with canes, appear from the wings, stop, survey the scene. Watson's eyes are shining with anticipation. In contrast, Holmes' face is sober and quizzical. Rogozhin spots the two, detaches himself from a group, hurries over to join them.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: There you are, Mr. Holmes. Madame is expecting you in her dressing room. Dr. Watson, you will amuse yourself meanwhile -- we have vodka, caviar, girls.
C: WATSON
D: No, thank you.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: No girls?
C: WATSON
D: No caviar. Makes me break out in hives.
N: Rogozhin turns to a group of ballerinas, claps his hands.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Dievushki. Siude, siuda, dievushki. Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom.
N: Half a dozen ballerinas descend on on Dr. Watson. They are giggling and chattering in Russian. Rogozhin leads Holmes off, while Watson takes in the bevy of beauties around him.
C: WATSON
D: Any of you girls understand English?
C: GIRLS
D: Nyet.
C: WATSON
D: Not one single word?
C: GIRLS
D: Nyet.
C: WATSON
D: In that case, I don't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos.
N: He pats a couple of the po-pos with his cane. BACKSTAGE Rogozhin is leading Holmes toward Madame Petrova's dressing room.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Mr. Holmes, I must prepare you -- this is no ordinary case.
C: HOLMES
D: It is only the extraordinary that interests me.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Good. Because you will find this extra- extraordinary.
N: They have now reached the door of Madame's dressing room. Rogozhin knocks. The door is opened by an elderly Russian maid.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Madame Petrova prinimaet?
C: MAID
D: Pozhaluista voidite.
N: Rogozhin leads Holmes inside. The maid steps out, shuts the door.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
N: It is small, elegant and sensuous. There is vodka in an ice-bucket, next to a Recamier chaise, a paravent, masses of flowers, and finally Madame Petrova, still in costume, sitting at a dressing table with multiple mirrors, undoing her hair. Candles, in two elaborate candleabra, give Madame's face a special glow.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Ja priviol vam Mistera Sherlock Holmesa, doragaia.
C: PETROVA
D: Otchen rada.
E: to Holmes
N: She extends her hand, and Holmes takes it.
C: HOLMES
D: Madame.
N: He kisses her hand. Petrova appraises him from head to toe, and back again.
C: PETROVA
D: Vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala.
E: to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: Madame says you are shorter than she thought.
C: HOLMES
D: I didn't mean to be.
C: PETROVA
D: No eto nie vazhno. Menia interessujut glavnim obra som vashi mosghi.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Short, tall, who cares? It is the brains that count.
C: HOLMES
D: Thank you. Thank you.
E: to Rogozhin catching himself, to Petrova
N: Petrova rises, crosses to the paravent.
C: PETROVA
D: Ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia. Zamiechatelno! Os sobenno sobaka Baskervillei.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Madame is great admirer of yours. She has read every story -- her favorite is Big Dog from Baskerville.
C: HOLMES
D: I'm afraid it loses something in translation.
N: Petrova is now behind the paravent, undressing, only her head visible.
C: PETROVA
D: Nikolai, pokazhite iemu skripku.
N: Rogozhin picks up a violin case, opens it.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Mr. Holmes, you know about fiddles. What is your opinion of this?
E: takes violin out, hands it to him
N: Holmes holds the violin up, peers through one of the sound holes.
C: HOLMES
D: 'Antonius Stradivarius Cremonesis, Anno 1709.' Well, the label is authentic. Judging from the shape, the color of the varnish, and the tone, I would say it is a genuine Stradivarius of the best period.
E: reading examines violin, plucks strings
C: ROGOZHIN
D: You like?
C: HOLMES
D: It's magnificent.
C: PETROVA
D: Skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot menia.
E: from behind paravent
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Here -- take it. Madame says it is yours.
C: HOLMES
D: Mine?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: For services you will render.
C: HOLMES
D: My fees as a detective are not exactly trifling -- but a Stradivarius -- you're not serious.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: I am not. But Madame is.
N: Petrova emerges from behind the paravent, in a brocade dressing gown.
C: PETROVA
D: Nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom dielo.
N: She drapes herself on the chaise.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: All right. I will pour vodka and explain. Mr. Holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova. She is retiring.
E: starts pouring vodka; it is pink
C: HOLMES
D: What a shame.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: She has been dancing since she was three years old. And after all, she is now thirty-eight.
C: HOLMES
D: I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight.
E: gallantly
C: ROGOZHIN
D: That is because she is forty-nine. So Madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child.
E: he hands her a glass of vodka, with an exaggerated smile
C: HOLMES
D: How admirable.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Problem now is to find father.
E: hands him vodka
C: HOLMES
D: Oh? Is he missing?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Correct.
C: HOLMES
D: And that's why you called me in?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Also correct. We must have father, because without father, how can there be child?
C: HOLMES
D: I see. The whole thing is still in the planning stage --
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Correct again. Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful. Since she is beautiful -- she now needs man who is brilliant.
N: Holmes' eyes wander slowly toward Petrova. She raises her glass.
C: PETROVA
D: Za zdorovie.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Za zdorovie.
E: raising his glass
C: HOLMES
D: Za zdrovie.
N: Petrova and Rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up. Holmes takes one swallow, then stops.
C: HOLMES
D: What's in it?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: What does it taste like?
C: HOLMES
D: Red pepper.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: That's what's in it.
N: While Rogozhin refills Petrova's glass and his own, Holmes takes another tentative sip.
C: PETROVA
D: Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj?
E: to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: I beg your pardon?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Madame wants to know how soon you can be ready.
C: HOLMES
D: Ready?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: To leave for Venice. All arrangements have been made. You will spend one week there with Madame...
C: HOLMES
D: Well, this is all very flattering. But surely there are other me -- better men --
C: ROGOZHIN
D: To tell you truth, you were not first choice. We considered Russian writer, Tolstoi --
C: HOLMES
D: That's more like it. The man's a genius.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Too old... Then we considered the philosopher, Nietzsche --
C: HOLMES
D: Absolutely first-rate mind...
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Too German... And we considered Tschaikowski --
C: HOLMES
D: Oh, you couldn't go wrong with Tschaikowski --
C: ROGOZHIN
D: We could -- and we did. It was catastrophe.
C: HOLMES
D: Why?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: You don't know? Because Tschaikowski -- how shall put it? Women not his glass of tea.
C: HOLMES
D: Pity, that.
C: PETROVA
D: Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim resheniem.
E: to Rogozhin
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Madame is very happy with final choice.
C: HOLMES
D: Madame mustn't be too hasty. She must remember I'm an Englishman.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: So?
C: HOLMES
D: You know what they say about us. If there's one thing more deplorable than our cooking, it's our love-making. We are not exactly the most romantic of people --
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Perfect. We don't want sentimental idiots -- falling in love, committing suicide. One week in Venice -- she goes back to St. Petersburg with baby -- you go back to London with fiddle.
C: HOLMES
D: An equitable arrangement. About my medical history -- when you asked me -- I neglected to mention a small detail. There is hemophilia in my family. We're all bleeders.
E: puts down violin
C: ROGOZHIN
D: On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut ghemofilijei.
E: to Petrova
C: PETROVA
D: Pust nie bezpokoitsa. Ja ostrighu sebe noghti.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Madame says not to worry. She will not scratch you.
C: HOLMES
D: That's reassuring to know. But --
C: PETROVA
D: Pochemu on kolebletsa? On nie nahodit menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi?
E: to Rogozhin
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Madame says you talk too much. You find her attractive or no?
N: Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watson sticks his head in. He is flushed and slightly inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear. From off comes the SOUND of wild balalaika music.
C: WATSON
D: Excuse me. What does prokanzik mean?
E: to Rogozhin
C: ROGOZHIN
D: It means 'You little devil.'
C: WATSON
D: It does? I am? Thank you.
N: He hurries off, shutting the door.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: I repeat question. You find Madame attractive or no?
E: to Holmes
N: Holmes is still looking at the door where Watson exited, an idea forming in his mind.
C: HOLMES
D: Oh, I find her most attractive -- for a woman, that is.
E: turning to Rogozhin
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Then no problem.
C: HOLMES
D: Maybe a slight one. You see, I am not a free man.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Not free? You are a bachelor.
C: HOLMES
D: A bachelor -- living with another bachelor -- for the last five years. Five very happy years.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: What is it you are trying to tell me?
C: HOLMES
D: I hoped I could avoid the subject. But some of us -- through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature --
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Get to point.
C: HOLMES
D: The point is that Tschaikowski is not an isolated case.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: You mean, you and Dr. Watson -- ? He is your glass of tea?
E: Holmes nods
C: HOLMES
D: If you want to be picturesque about it.
C: PETROVA
D: Chto on govorit? Pri chom tut Chaikovsky?
E: slightly agitated
C: ROGOZHIN
D: On pederast.
C: PETROVA
D: Jescho odin? Eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno! Kakoi vi idiot!
E: on her feet now; flaring
C: HOLMES
D: Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine. But I would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a gondola in Venice.
E: picking up his silk hat and cane
N: He takes her limp hand, kisses it. Then he crosses to the door.
C: HOLMES
D: It would have been catastrophe.
E: imitating Rogozhin's accent
N: He exits. Rogozhin starts to pour himself another glass of vodka. Petrova slaps the glass out of his hand.
C: PETROVA
D: Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe, prezhde chem posoritj menia!
E: screaming
N: STAGE The party has built into a real wingding by now. It's wild -- drinking, laughing, singing. Everybody is turned on -- especially Watson. He is dancing with a dozen of the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music. Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of breath -- he is in paradise. Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches Watson.
C: HOLMES
D: Watson! Watson, are you coming?
E: Watson pays no attention
C: WATSON
D: What is it, old boy?
E: without missing a step
C: HOLMES
D: We're going home.
C: WATSON
D: Home? Not a chance. Not the slightest -- not the remotest chance. Toodle-ooo.
N: He waves goodbye, and goes on swirling dizzily with the girls. Holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves. A shaken Rogozhin comes up to the buffet, pours himself a stiff drink of vodka. As he drinks his eyes follow the dancing Watson balefully. Watson spins off several of the girls, grabs another group. His ex-partners wind up close to Rogozhin. He whispers something to them. Their eyes widen, and they stare at Watson with disbelief. Watson again switches partners, and the first girls now whisper intensely to those who just left the floor. The same reaction. Watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around with another set of girls. By now some of the girls who are in on the secret are whispering to the male dancers in tights. Their reaction is slightly different. They are seeing Watson in a new light. And before Watson knows what's happening, he has been abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first by one pair then another pair of male dancers, till he is dancing only with gay guys in tights. It gradually dawns on Watson that there is something wrong with this state of affairs. After some difficulty, he breaks away from them.
C: WATSON
D: Hold on! Just a moment!
N: Spotting Rogozhin, he crosses to him. The girls shrink away at his approach.
C: WATSON
D: What's going on? What happened to the girls?
E: bewildered
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Why? Do you not prefer it this way?
C: WATSON
D: What way?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: You don't have to pretend. Mr. Holmes told us everything -- about you and him --
C: WATSON
D: About me and him?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Come now, no need to be bashful. We are not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual -- but in ballet, is very usual.
C: WATSON
D: What is?
C: ROGOZHIN
D: Caprice of Mother Nature. Look at Pavel and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri --
N: Watson looks around at the boys in tights, who are standing in a half-circle, grinning at him insolently. It is beginning to dawn on him. He pales.
C: ROGOZHIN
D: -- And Ilya and Sergei -- Sergei -- half and half.
E: breaks off, rocks his hand back and forth
N: He pours himself another vodka. Watson grabs the glass away from him, downs it with a gulp.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: In contrast to the frenetic ambiance of the back-stage party, the room seems doubly placid. Holmes, his dinner coat replaced by a smoking jacket, is sitting in the wing chair, having a quiet pipe after the evening's peculiar adventure. Only the desk lamp is lit. From the street, there is the sound of hurried, angry footsteps approaching the house. Holmes turns his head languidly -- he knows who is coming.
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: An enraged Watson, cane and opera glasses in hand, and the flower still behind his ear, is jogging down the center of the deserted street.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Holmes rises casually, twists the wing chair so that its back is to the door, crosses to the lamp on the desk, turns the wick down. From off comes the sound of Watson's key rattling in the front door lock. STAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT The front door opens and Watson storms into the vestibule.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes!
N: He races up the stairs and across the landing, flings open the door of the flat.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes!
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Watson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway. Over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling up from Holmes' pipe.
C: WATSON
D: There you are, you wretch! You rotter! You blackguard! Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications. What do you have to say for yourself?
N: No answer from Holmes. We now see -- but Watson does not -- that the chair is occupied by a section of Holmes' smoking machine, with the pipe attached.
C: WATSON
D: Don't just sit there -- speak up, man!
N: Still no answer -- just a little pipe smoke drifting up from the wing chair. Incensed, Watson raises the opera glasses, tosses them toward the chair. There is a loud thud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence. Watson suddenly becomes concerned.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes...? Are you all right, Holmes?
N: He approaches the chair apprehensively, shoves it aside -- and there on the floor is the smoking machine, still wheezing slightly. Watson picks it up, and his eyes travel to Holmes, standing in a shadowy corner, working the bellows with his foot.
C: HOLMES
D: From the sound of your footsteps, I gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood.
C: WATSON
D: How could you do a dastardly thing like that to me? What the deuce were you thinking of?
E: with renewed fury
N: He dashes the smoking machine to the floor.
C: HOLMES
D: Watson, you have my most abject apologies. But have you ever been cornered by a madwoman? It seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings.
C: WATSON
D: What about my feelings? And my reputation? Do you realize the gravity of what you have done? The possible repercussions?
C: HOLMES
D: So there'll be a little gossip about you in St. Petersburg...
C: WATSON
D: These things spread like wildfire. I can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back. I'll never be able to show my face in polite society...
N: And if it ever got back to my old regiment -- you don't know the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers -- they'll strike me off the rolls -- they'll cut off my pension...
C: HOLMES
D: Watson, you're running amok.
C: WATSON
D: Dishonored, disgraced, ostracized. What am I to do?
C: HOLMES
D: Well, for one thing, I'd get rid of that flower.
N: He points to the flower behind Watson's ear. Watson grabs the flower, hurls it into the fireplace.
C: WATSON
D: You may think this is funny, but we're both in the same boat. We must take desperate measures. We must stop this talk... Maybe if we got married...
E: a beat, then an idea
C: HOLMES
D: Then they'd really talk...
C: WATSON
D: Obviously, we cannot continue to live under the same roof. We must move apart.
E: starts pacing
C: HOLMES
D: Of course, we can still see each other clandestinely -- on remote benches in Hyde Park, and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations --
C: WATSON
D: The whole thing is ridiculous. We have nothing to hide.
E: a change in attitude; defiant
C: HOLMES
D: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
C: WATSON
D: Let somebody start a rumor -- just one ugly word -- and we'll sue them for slander.
C: HOLMES
D: Nobody would dare. After all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex.
C: WATSON
D: Damn right. I can get women from three continents to testify for me. And you can get women to vouch for you, too -- can't you, Holmes?
N: No answer from Holmes. Watson is becoming a little concerned.
C: WATSON
D: Can you, Holmes?
C: HOLMES
D: Good night, Watson.
N: He starts toward his bedroom.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, let me ask you a question -- I hope I'm not being presumptuous -- but there have been women in your life?
E: Holmes stops
C: HOLMES
D: The answer is yes. You're being presumptuous. Good night.
E: a relieved sigh from Watson Watson's face falls
N: He walks into his bedroom, shutting the door. Watson takes a tentative step after him.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: There is a cheery fire burning in the grate. Holmes is stretched out full-length on the couch, playing a set of Corelli variations on his violin. Watson is in his usual chair, reading the Evening Standard.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: What, indeed, was his attitude toward women? Was there some secret he was holding back -- or was he just a thinking machine, incapable of any emotion?
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: Wisps of fog swirl along the street, making yellow haloes around street lamps.
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: I was not to get the answer until we became involved in what I consider to be the most outrageous case in all our years together.
N: Out of the mist comes a hansom cab, with the dim figure of a woman visible in the passenger seat. The cab stops in front of 221B, and the driver starts to get down. From upstairs comes the faint sound of violin music.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Watson steps up to the window, pulls the curtain aside, looks down toward the street.
S: EXT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: The cabbie crosses the pavement, consults an address in his hand, glances up at the number of the house, then rings the bell.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: Watson turns away from the window, as the BELL downstairs rings again. Holmes stops playing.
C: WATSON
D: Were you expecting someone?
C: HOLMES
D: Not at this hour.
C: WATSON
D: Maybe Mrs. Hudson is entertaining.
C: HOLMES
D: I never found her so.
N: Watson crosses to the door, opens it, steps out. Holmes resumes playing Corelli. VESTIBULE AND STAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT Mrs. Hudson, in a robe and night-cap, is talking to the cabbie in the open street door when Watson appears on the landing above.
C: WATSON
D: What is it, Mrs. Hudson?
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: There's a cabbie here -- he says you owe him two-and-six.
E: looking up
C: WATSON
D: For what?
C: CABBIE
D: For the fare, guv'nor. The young lady doesn't have any money.
E: to Watson
C: WATSON
D: What young lady?
C: CABBIE
D: This one.
N: He reaches out the door, pulls in the young lady in question. She is in her early thirties, with strikingly handsome features, but at the moment she is somewhat worse for wear. She is wrapped in a blanket, her hair is wet, and there is a bruise on her temple. She is wearing and wedding ring and her name, we will subsequently learn, is GABRIELLE.
C: WATSON
D: Well. What have we here? Who are you, miss? What happened to you?
E: he starts down the stairs
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't know.
E: slight accent
C: CABBIE
D: That's all she keeps saying -- I don't know, I don't know.
N: The violin music stops o.s. Watson has now reached the foot of the stairs.
C: WATSON
D: Where did she come from?
C: CABBIE
D: From the river. I was driving down the Embankment, just below Westminster Bridge, and there she was in the water -- drowning.
N: Holmes appears on the landing above, violin and bow in his hand.
C: CABBIE
D: It wasn't easy, guv'nor -- what with the cold water -- and her fighting me --
C: HOLMES
D: Why did you bring her here?
E: from the upper landing
C: CABBIE
D: Because I found this in her hand -- -- 221B Baker Street -- that's right, isn't it?
E: gives a square of soggy cardboard to Watson
N: Watson examines the cardboard, nods.
C: HOLMES
D: Young lady -- what did you want at this address?
E: to Gabrielle
C: GABRIELLE
D: I do not remember.
E: looking up, trying to focus
C: WATSON
D: Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?
E: to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: Rather.
C: CABBIE
D: Well, gentlemen, you want her? -- it's two-and-six -- or shall I throw her back in the river?
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Mr. Holmes. You can't let him --
C: HOLMES
D: Watson, you'd better accept delivery.
N: Watson fishes some coins out of his pocket, hands them to the cabbie.
C: WATSON
D: Keep the change.
C: CABBIE
D: Thank you, guv'nor.
N: He snatches the blanket off Gabrielle, revealing that her dress is clinging to her damply.
C: CABBIE
D: No extra charge for the use of the horse- blanket.
N: He exits into the street, shutting the door. Gabrielle hugs herself for warmth.
C: WATSON
D: You're shivering, my dear.
E: he puts his arm around her
N: Come along. Let me get you out of those wet clothes. He starts to lead her up the stairs.
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: The cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and is mounting the driver's seat. Across the street, a man steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of the street lamps. He is a craggy-faced Prussian of about fifty, and his name is VON TIRPITZ. He looks up toward the Holmes flat. As the hansom makes a U-turn and comes abreast of him, he hops into the cab. The hansom disappears into the fog.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT
N: Watson is leading Gabrielle to a chair by the fireplace. Holmes is putting his violin down on the table.
C: WATSON
D: Sit here, my dear.
N: He settles her in the chair. Holmes comes over, plucks the square of cardboard from Watson's hand.
C: WATSON
D: She's suffering from shock and exposure.
N: He starts to massage her wrists to restore her circulation. Holmes is examining the soggy cardboard. On one side is their address, written in pencil. He turns it over, disclosing some smudges of green ink on the other side.
C: HOLMES
D: There was some printing on the back of this -- but it seems to have come off in the water.
N: Watson is now studying the bruise on Gabrielle's temple.
C: WATSON
D: Look at this -- she's had a nasty blow on the head.
N: HOLMES Could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river?
C: WATSON
D: No. The blood has already coagulated. So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack... Get my bag, will you?
N: As Holmes fetches the medical bag, Gabrielle looks from one to the other.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Who are you?
C: WATSON
D: I'm Dr. Watson -- and this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Do the names mean anything to you?
C: GABRIELLE
D: No.
C: WATSON
D: Think.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'm trying.
C: HOLMES
D: Can you think of your own name?
C: GABRIELLE
D: No.
E: a beat, then shakes her head
C: WATSON
D: She's obviously had a concussion -- which often leads to temporary amnesia.
N: He has now taken some cotton and a bottle of antiseptic out of the medical bag, and is swabbing her wound.
C: HOLMES
D: So all we know is that she was coshed on the head, dumped into the Thames, and subsequently dumped into our laps.
C: WATSON
D: We know a lot more than that. From her accent, we know she is foreign -- from her ring, we know she is married -- and there is one other clue we have... Something I deduced while I was helping her up the stairs. No corset.
C: HOLMES
D: Good work.
N: He glances down at Gabrielle's shoe, which has slipped off her foot. Inside, slightly worn away, are the words: LA FEMME ELEGANTE.
C: HOLMES
D: Are you French? Vous etes Francaise?
E: to Gabrielle in Berlitz French
C: GABRIELLE
D: Non, je ne suis pas Francaise.
E: concentrating -- then
C: WATSON
D: How can she say she's not French, in French?
C: HOLMES
D: Vous etes Suisse?
C: GABRIELLE
D: Non.
C: HOLMES
D: Alors, vous etes Belge.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Je suis pas sure.
E: haltingly
N: Holmes reaches behind her, turns back the collar of her dress. Sewn inside is a label reading: BAZAAR MODERN, Bruxelles.
C: HOLMES
D: Vous etes Belge -- de Bruxelles!
C: GABRIELLE
D: Bruxelles? Oui... Je pense que oui.
N: Mrs. Hudson has come in with a loaded tea-tray, starts to put it down on the table.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Oh, dash. Will someone remove the violin, please?
N: Watson takes the violin off the table, and she sets down the tray.
C: WATSON
D: We just found out that she's Belgian.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Poor thing.
C: WATSON
D: From Brussels.
C: HOLMES
D: If you don't mind.
E: taking Gabrielle's hand
N: He slips the wedding ring off her finger, picks up a magnifying glass, examines it. It is made of copper, and engraved on the inside is the inscription: Gabrielle - Emile.
C: HOLMES
D: Your name is Gabrielle, is that right? Gabrielle?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't know.
C: HOLMES
D: And your husband's name is Emile?
C: GABRIELLE
D: Emile...
E: vaguely
C: HOLMES
D: Where is he? What are you doing in London?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't know.
C: HOLMES
D: When did you arrive from Brussels? Where are you staying?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't know.
C: HOLMES
D: What happened at the river? Think! Pensez! Concentrez vous!
N: Gabrielle bursts into sobs.
C: WATSON
D: That's enough, Holmes. I will not permit you to question her in this condition. Mrs. Hudson, put her to bed. My bed. I'll sleep on the couch.
E: stepping forward helps the sobbing Gabrielle out of the chair Mrs. Hudson gives him a look
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Come, my dear.
N: She puts her arm around Gabrielle, who is still crying, leads her into Watson's bedroom.
C: WATSON
D: I'd better mix her a sleeping potion.
N: He gets a packet of white powder out of his medical bag, and during the following, stirs a spoonful into her tea- cup.
C: HOLMES
D: Watson, I think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital.
C: WATSON
D: Under no circumstances.
C: HOLMES
D: She should have medical attention.
C: WATSON
D: She can get that from me. But more importantly, she must be protected -- there has already been one attempt on her life.
C: HOLMES
D: This temporary amnesia -- how temporary is it?
C: WATSON
D: It depends on the extent of the injury. It's like veils shrouding her memory. It could clear up in a few days -- or a few weeks.
C: HOLMES
D: Watson, this is a very small flat -- we don't want to clutter it up with women...
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, we've never had a case like this. A woman comes to us with a problem -- we don't know who the woman is -- and we don't know what the problem is. Don't you find that challenging?
C: HOLMES
D: Quite. But we can't afford to wait for those veils to lift -- we must break through them as quickly as possible.
C: WATSON
D: You really feel it's that urgent?
C: HOLMES
D: I do. The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can get rid of her.
C: WATSON
D: Oh.
N: He picks up the cup of tea with the sedative in it, carries it toward the door of his bedroom.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - DAWN
N: The street lamps are still lit. A policeman, on patrol duty, is strolling along the sidewalk, swinging his truncheon. Suddenly he sees something up ahead. Alarmed, he ducks into the doorway of a building, flattens himself against the door. From the opposite direction comes a horse-drawn water- sprinkling wagon. The spray covers the sidewalks as well as the street. The policeman waits till the wagon is past, then steps out of the doorway relieved, resumes his patrol.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAWN
N: Watson is asleep on the couch, covered with a blanket. He doesn't look as if he were in a very comfortable position.
S: INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWN
N: Holmes, in a dressing gown, is standing by the window, studying the square of cardboard with the green smudges on it. His bed has not been slept in.
S: INT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAWN
N: Gabrielle is asleep in Watson's bed. The door opens slowly, and Holmes looks in. He studies the sleeping Gabrielle for a moment, then quietly pulls the door shut. As the latch clicks into place, Gabrielle awakes and sits up in bed, her back to CAMERA. She is nude.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Emile?
N: She starts to get out of bed.
S: INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWN
N: Holmes is back in his room, once more examining the cardboard by the light of the window. The door of Watson's bedroom opens, and Gabrielle comes out.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Emile?
N: Holmes looks up as Gabrielle appears in the open doorway.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Emile? Is that you, Emile?
C: HOLMES
D: Yes, Gabrielle.
E: stepping into shadow
C: GABRIELLE
D: Ah, Emile. I thought I'd never find you. Hold me. Hold me tight. It's been such a long time. So many nights. You know what I did before I left Brussels?
E: hurrying toward him embracing him Holmes puts his arms around her
C: HOLMES
D: What?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I hope you won't be angry with me. I bought myself an expensive negligee.
C: HOLMES
D: Did you?
C: GABRIELLE
D: A pink negligee with maribou feathers. Don't you think that's a foolish thing for a married woman? Come.
E: moving toward bed she gets into bed, beckons to him
C: HOLMES
D: Where is the negligee?
C: GABRIELLE
D: In my luggage... Come here.
C: HOLMES
D: And where is your luggage?
E: moving toward her
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't know. Come, my love. Come. Please.
E: impatiently
N: As she extends her right hand to him, in a beckoning gesture, Holmes notices something on the palm. He takes her hand in his. There, in the same green ink as the smudges on the cardboard, are what appear the be the letters "I", "O", and Greek "E". Crossing to the wash- stand, he picks up his magnifying shaving mirror, returns to the bed, holds it up against the palm of Gabrielle's hand.
C: GABRIELLE
D: What is it, Emile? What are you doing?
N: Clearly reflected in the mirror is the reverse image of the lettering on Gabrielle's palm -- the number "301".
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
N: The table is set for breakfast, and Mrs. Hudson is opening the curtains, flooding the room with sunlight. Then she moves over to the couch, where Watson is sleeping in an awkward position.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Dr. Watson! Your porridge is getting lumpy. Hadn't you better get up?
E: she claps her hands and he wakes up
N: Watson tries to rise, falls back with a moan.
C: WATSON
D: I would like to very much. But -- Mrs. Hudson, would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back?
E: he turns over on his stomach
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Yes, I would.
C: WATSON
D: Please! I'm in excruciating pain.
N: Mrs. Hudson tentatively rests her knee on Watson's back.
C: WATSON
D: A bit higher -- just below my seventh vertebra -- That's good. Put your arms under mine -- fold them behind my neck --
E: Mrs. Hudson follows instructions
N: Mrs. Hudson presses down harder, and there is a distinct snap.
C: WATSON
D: Bless you. That damn couch. You'd better see if our patient is awake.
E: he rises, rubbing his neck crossing to table
N: He seats himself at the table. Mrs. Hudson crosses to the door of Watson's bedroom, opens it, starts inside, then stops.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Dr. Watson. She's gone.
C: WATSON
D: Gone?
N: He jumps up from the table, joins Mrs. Hudson, looks past her. The bed is empty. Gabrielle's clothes are in evidence, but there is no sign of her. Watson strides towards Holmes' bedroom.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes! Holmes! She's gone!
N: He throws the door open, is about to step inside when he sees something that makes him freeze.
S: INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAY
N: Gabrielle is asleep in Holmes' bed, covered by just a sheet, and obviously naked underneath. Holmes is not in the room. Mrs. Hudson comes up behind Watson, in the open doorway, peers over his shoulder.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Well, I never!
E: scandalized
N: There is the sound of the hall door opening, and they both turn.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Holmes breezes in, carrying a large suitcase, with leather straps around it. Tucked under the straps is a white parasol. And attached to the handle of the suitcase is a cardboard tag with the number 301 on it, in green.
C: HOLMES
D: Mmmmm. I smell porridge. Lumpy as usual, I suppose.
E: inhaling deeply
N: He sets the suitcase down on the couch, as Watson and Mrs. Hudson approach.
C: WATSON
D: Oh, there you are, Holmes. We were just wondering -- how --
E: points from his bedroom to Holmes'
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: We certainly were.
E: sternly
C: HOLMES
D: Mrs. Hudson, why don't you go down to the kitchen -- get a towel -- and wipe that look of disapproval off your face.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Liberties -- in my house!
N: She exits huffily.
C: WATSON
D: You can't really blame her -- I mean, the way it looks -- if I didn't know you better, I might suspect you'd taken advantage of the young lady.
C: HOLMES
D: As a matter of fact, I did take advantage of her... Would you hand me the butter- knife, please?
C: WATSON
D: Of course.
N: He picks up the butter-knife from the table, suddenly turns back with a delayed reaction.
C: WATSON
D: You did what?
C: HOLMES
D: Thank you.
E: taking butter-knife from him
N: He starts to pry open the locks of the suitcase with the butter-knife.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, this is reprehensible! Where are your professional ethics? Have you no sense of decency, no shame --
E: spluttering
C: HOLMES
D: None whatsoever. If you must know, I found her body quite rewarding.
C: WATSON
D: You cad!
C: HOLMES
D: Especially the palm of her right hand.
C: WATSON
D: I'd rather not hear about it!
C: HOLMES
D: Very well. Then I won't bother to tell you how I traced her suitcase.
C: WATSON
D: That's her suitcase?
C: HOLMES
D: Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it? It was a luggage ticket -- the number rubbed off on her hand. And since she must have arrived from Brussels by the boat train, I concluded that she had checked her belongings at Victoria Station.
C: WATSON
D: By Jove! If you're right, we should find a clue to her identity.
N: Holmes has now forced open the locks.
C: HOLMES
D: Or at least a pink negligee with maribou feathers.
N: He opens the suitcase, lifts out the top piece of clothing, holds it up -- a pink negligee with maribou feathers.
C: HOLMES
D: Voila!
C: WATSON
D: Let's see - what else is in here?
N: They start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase. Holmes removes a tied bundle of letters.
C: HOLMES
D: Now we're getting somewhere.
N: As he examines the envelope, Watson takes out a framed photo of a rather attractive man of fifty.
C: WATSON
D: Who do you suppose this is?
N: Gabrielle appears from Holmes' bedroom wearing Holmes' dressing gown. She is unsteady on her feet and somewhat dazed. Holmes looks up.
C: HOLMES
D: Come in, Madame Valladon. You are Gabrielle Valladon.
E: Gabrielle stops
C: GABRIELLE
D: Yes.
C: HOLMES
D: And this is your husband, Emile Valladon?
E: holding up photo
C: GABRIELLE
D: Yes.
N: Her eyes fall on the open suitcase.
C: HOLMES
D: Sorry to have ransacked your valise. But since you came to us for help --
C: GABRIELLE
D: Where am I?
C: WATSON
D: 221B Baker Street.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Oh, yes... Which of you is Mr. Holmes and which is Dr. Watson?
E: a beat, as she orients herself
C: HOLMES
D: Dr. Watson is the handsome one.
N: Watson, pleased, twirls the end of his mustache. Gabrielle sways slightly.
C: HOLMES
D: That's the way he affects most women.
N: He helps her into a chair.
C: WATSON
D: Coffee. You want strong coffee.
E: to Gabrielle
N: He hurries over to the breakfast table.
C: GABRIELLE
D: It's all so confusing.
C: HOLMES
D: Let's try to sort it out. You came to London looking for your husband...
C: GABRIELLE
D: Yes. He's a mining engineer. We were married five years ago, in the Congo.
C: HOLMES
D: Where your husband was working in a copper mine.
C: GABRIELLE
D: How did you know?
C: HOLMES
D: Your wedding ring -- it's made of copper.
N: He picks it up from the chemistry table, hands it to her. Gabrielle starts to put it on.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Last year he invented a new kind of air pump, and was hired by an English company, Jonah Limited.
C: WATSON
D: Here you are.
E: handing her cup of of coffee
C: HOLMES
D: Jonah Limited. Go on.
C: GABRIELLE
D: We've been writing to each other regularly. Then suddenly, three weeks ago, his letters stopped. I kept writing ... but no answer. Finally I decided to go to that address --
N: She indicates the bundle of letters. Holmes glances at the return address on the back of the envelope.
C: HOLMES
D: 32 Ashdown Street.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Yes. It's just an empty store -- nobody there. Then I tried to find Jonah Limited. No such company exists.
C: WATSON
D: How decidedly odd.
C: HOLMES
D: Madame Valladon, can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you about theses things?
C: GABRIELLE
D: Emile? Never. He loves me -- and I love him.
C: HOLMES
D: So I gathered.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I went to the police -- they said they would send out a missing persons report -- but they didn't sound too encouraging. Then I went to the Belgian embassy and explained the situation to them -- and they suggested that I consult you...
C: WATSON
D: You could have done worse.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I was on my way here -- and suddenly there were footsteps behind me -- and a hand over my mouth -- and the smell of choloroform -- and the next thing I knew I was in the water -- and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket --
C: HOLMES
D: Madame Valladon, somebody tried to kill you last night. Do you have any idea who could have done it?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't understand any of it. What does it all mean, Mr. Holmes? Where is my husband? You must help me find him.
E: rises, goes to Holmes
C: WATSON
D: We'll do our best, I assure you.
C: HOLMES
D: Madame Valladon, I want you to send one more letter to your husband.
N: He crosses to the desk, picks up a sheet of paper and an envelope, then leads Gabrielle over to the chair with the writing arm, seats her in it.
C: HOLMES
D: To Emile Valladon -- Ashdown Street -- what was that number?
C: GABRIELLE
D: 32. What do you want me to say in the letter?
E: addressing envelope
C: HOLMES
D: Nothing.
N: He folds the blank sheet of paper, and as Gabrielle finishes addressing the envelope, he inserts the paper in it, starts to seal it.
C: WATSON
D: You're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop?
C: HOLMES
D: That empty shop is obviously being used as an accomodation address, or letter- drop. But what gets dropped must be picked up. The question is how? -- and by whom? -- and why?
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ASHDOWN STREET - DAY
N: This is a run-down district in the northwestern part of London. On the corner is No. 32 -- a dilapidated abandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up. As CAMERA APPROACHES the building, we hear sawing from inside.
S: INT. EMPTY SHOP - DAY
N: It is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding. In the rear wall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot into the shop. Nearby stands a large, square object, covered with a tarpaulin. High up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fitted with an iron grill. From outside, Holmes, in deerstalker and Inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars. Watson and Gabrielle are beside him.
C: HOLMES
D: Hammer... Chisel.
N: Watson hands him the indicated tools. Holmes chips away the cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, then using it as a hinge, swings the grill open. He lets himself through the skylight, drops to the floor. Watson now helps Gabrielle through the skylight, lowers her toward Holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, eases her to the floor. For a brief moment he keeps his arms around her. Watson has now squeezed through the skylight.
C: WATSON
D: Here!
N: He hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor. Gabrielle is looking around the shop.
C: GABRIELLE
D: It's so strange to think I've been writing to a place like this all these months.
N: Watson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object. He lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds. What he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about a hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around unside.
C: WATSON
D: Look at all these canaries. Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop?
C: HOLMES
D: Maybe. Here comes our letter.
E: pointing off
N: Through the front window, the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching. He drops a letter through the slot in the front door, moves on. The letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust -- except for a series of double tracks, running to the door and curving back.
C: HOLMES
D: Now we are faced with the most nerve- wracking part of the detective's job -- doing nothing.
N: He reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into another, to form a cane.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Mr. Holmes --
C: HOLMES
D: Yes?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't know how I'm going to pay you for all this. The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.
C: HOLMES
D: It could be worse. You could be at the bottom of the Thames -- much to your discomfort -- and much to my chagrin.
C: WATSON
D: I don't understand how anybody picks up letters here. No footprints -- just tracks. What does it mean?
E: pointing
C: HOLMES
D: I would surmise somebody is using ice- skates -- if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.
N: They become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. The noise stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the rattle of a chain.
C: WATSON
D: What do we do now?
E: in a frantic whisper
C: HOLMES
D: This way.
E: unfazed
N: He leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, right next to the door. They flatten themselves with their backs to the wall, just as the door slides open -- concealing them from view. Revealed is the mews behind the shop. In the door is an old BIDDY with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair. In her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water. As she wheels herself inside, the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly. She stops in front of the cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing the canaries.
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: Good morning, my pretties. Here's Mum with your breakfast. Did you think I'd forgotten you?
E: addressing birds
N: She pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a trough.
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: Some of you will be going on a little trip soon -- I hate to lose you -- but even an old woman has to live. Although you might well ask, why?
N: She cackles to herself, glances toward the front door.
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: Oh. You never told me we had a letter.
N: She starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop. Through a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her. The old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address. Then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door. A horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the back of the wagon. As they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them.
C: FIRST CARTER
D: Morning, Duchess.
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: Morning.
C: SECOND CARTER
D: What have you been doing with yourself?
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: What do you think? Taking dancing lessons. How many do you want this time?
E: she stops in front of the cage
C: FIRST CARTER
D: Two dozen.
N: He opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage.
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: What are they doing with all those canaries? What's going on up there?
C: SECOND CARTER
D: Look, Duchess, we don't know -- and we don't want to know.
C: FIRST CARTER
D: When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions.
N: Through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden, we see Holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the canaries are being transferred into it. We MOVE IN CLOSE on the small cage, and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom. The masthead reads: INVERNESS COURIER.
C: FIRST CARTER
D: ... twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty- four.
E: counting as he transfers canaries
N: He closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small cage. His companion indicates the letter in the woman's lap.
C: SECOND CARTER
D: How about that letter? Does that go, too?
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: No. That's going to be picked up in person.
N: She chuckles. The carriers exit into the mews, stash the cage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat.
C: WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
D: All right, my pretties. Back to sleep you go. See you tomorrow.
E: to birds
N: She pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage. Then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage, wheels herself out the rear door. As she slides it shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door. There is the sound of the chain rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels moving off.
C: WATSON
D: I really thought we were done for.
E: a sigh of relief
C: HOLMES
D: The art of concealment, my dear Watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time.
E: casually
N: They step forward, and through the painted shop window watch the old woman wheel herself down the street.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Did you hear what she said? You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself?
C: HOLMES
D: It certainly would simplify things, wouldn't it?
C: WATSON
D: Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs... And what was all that about Jonah? And what do you suppose they're doing up there? And where is up there?
E: shaking his head
C: HOLMES
D: My guess would be Scotland. Inverness, to be more precise.
C: WATSON
D: Inverness?
C: HOLMES
D: Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage? The Inverness Courier.
N: Gabrielle glances casually at the letter the old woman left lying on top of the cage, and her expression changes.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Mr. Holmes! This letter --
E: she picks it up
C: HOLMES
D: What about it?
C: GABRIELLE
D: It's addressed to you.
E: holding it out to him
N: Holmes takes the letter, examines the envelope. It is indeed addressed to him.
C: HOLMES
D: Nevertheless --
N: With the saw-end of his cane, he slits the envelope open, removes the enclosure, unfolds it. We see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud. The letterhead says: DIOGENES CLUB, St. James's, London.
C: HOLMES
D: My Dear Sherlock: I expect you and Dr. Watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note. According to my calculations, that should be at 11:40 a.m. Your brother, Mycroft. What time do you make it, Watson?
E: reading looking up
C: WATSON
E: consulting watch
C: HOLMES
D: Either your watch is wrong, or Mycroft has miscalculated. And knowing Mycroft, I suggest you reset your watch.
N: Watson automatcially obeys.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. DIOGENES CLUB - DAY
N: Holmes, cane in hand, and Watson are swiftly ascending the steps of a building with an imposing Palladian facade. Beside the entrance is a discreet sign reading: DIOGENES CLUB. Members Only. As they reach the top of the steps, Watson stops Holmes.
C: WATSON
D: I don't mind telling you I'm a bit apprehensive about this.
C: HOLMES
D: I'm rather curious myself as to what is going on in that Machiavellian mind of his.
C: WATSON
D: I don't mean Mycroft, I mean Madame Valladon.
C: HOLMES
D: Don't worry. She's perfectly safe with Mrs. Hudson.
N: He opens the door and they start in.
S: INT. LOBBY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY
N: Dominating the lobby is a large statue of Queen Victoria. Presiding over the reception desk is a uniformed PORTER of military bearing, with one arm and a chest full of campaign ribbons. Holmes and Watson stride in.
C: HOLMES
D: To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.
E: to porter
C: PORTER
D: Right you are. He's expecting you in the upstairs study. Now if you gentlemen will sign in -- Surname, Christian name, address, nature of business --
E: opens leather-bound register, turns it toward them
N: He holds out the pen to them, but they are gone. He looks around in consternation, sees them hurrying up the majestic staircase, steps out from behind his desk.
C: PORTER
D: Gentlemen...!
N: READING ROOM - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY A huge room, with more marble than a mausoleum, and just about as lively. A dozen elderly Establishment types are sunk deep in the leather armchairs, buried behind their copies of The Times. Holmes and Watson are proceeding toward the study. Suddenly Holmes stops beside one of the old fossils, who has fallen asleep in his chair, The Times in his lap, and between his fingers a lighted cigar with an ash four inches long. Holmes picks up an ashtray, holds it under the cigar -- just in time to catch the falling ash. As he replaces the ashtray, he scrutinizes the ash.
C: HOLMES
D: Jamaican, no doubt -- either Tropical or Golosina -- I'm not quite sure.
N: He and Watson continue toward the study door.
S: INT. STUDY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY
N: It is a very elegant room -- shelves of leather-bound volumes reach to the high ceiling, there are antique terrestrial and celestial gloves, scientific instruments in polished brass, marble busts of English statesmen. MYCROFT HOLMES is standing at a refectory table, with his back to the door, engaged in a curious operation. A dusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineered cradle. As he turns the crank, the bottle tilts forward gently, and he decants the wine into three glasses without disturbing the sediment. Mycroft is an impressive figure of a man, seven years older than Sherlock, impeccably dressed. Behind his snobbish airs and bantering manner, one senses tremendous reserves of strength and authority. The door opens, and Holmes and Watson enter.
C: MYCROFT
D: Come in, come in, Sherlock -- Dr. Watson... Sit down. You're looking very fit, both of you.
E: without turning Holmes and Watson seat themselves
C: WATSON
D: Thank you.
C: HOLMES
D: And how are you, Mycroft? How's your gout?
E: putting down hat and cane
C: MYCROFT
D: Under control. Except for the occasional twinge.
N: He brings over two of the glasses of wine to Holmes and Watson.
C: MYCROFT
D: I have a treat for you -- a very old Madeira -- 1814. There are only six bottles left in the world. I have two of them, and am negotiating for a third.
C: WATSON
D: If you don't mind my saying so, anybody who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be --
N: Mycroft has moved back to the table and picked up his glass of Madeira.
C: MYCROFT
D: The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason. Your very good health.
N: He and Watson sip their drinks, but not Holmes.
C: HOLMES
D: Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us?
C: MYCROFT
D: Well, I see you so rarely. How long has it been? Not since the case of the Greek interpreter. Isn't it ridiculous? Two brothers living in the same town...
E: to Watson
C: HOLMES
D: In the same town, perhaps -- but not the same world.
C: WATSON
D: Mmmm. Superb. How old did you say it was?
E: taking another sip
C: MYCROFT
D: 1814. One year before Waterloo.
C: WATSON
D: One year before Waterloo? Think of that.
C: MYCROFT
D: You do know where Waterloo is, don't you, Doctor?
C: WATSON
D: Belgium, isn't it?
C: MYCROFT
D: Quite. And speaking of Belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.
E: turning to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: Yes, I am.
C: MYCROFT
D: Well, I can save you a lot of trouble.
C: HOLMES
D: I'd be grateful for any suggestion --
C: MYCROFT
D: My suggestion is that you pursue it no further.
C: HOLMES
D: Any particular reason?
C: MYCROFT
D: Because it involves the national security. We are handling this matter ourselves.
C: WATSON
D: We? Who's we?
C: HOLMES
D: The Diogenes Club, of course.
C: MYCROFT
D: I didn't say that.
C: HOLMES
D: I have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the Foreign Office in Whitehall.
C: MYCROFT
D: That's neither here nor there.
C: HOLMES
D: It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is here, there and everywhere. When there are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan, an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile. When there is trouble along the Indian frontier, some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas, alledgedly looking for the Abominable Snowman.
N: A YOUNG MAN in morning coat and striped trousers comes in, holding a telegram. Mycroft crosses to him.
C: MYCROFT
D: What a fertile imagination my brother has. At the age of five, by carefully observing a neighbor's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork, but by the mid-wife in her satchel.
E: to Watson
C: WATSON
D: As good an explanation as any.
N: Mycroft has taken the telegram, and is coming forward with it. The young man clears his throat.
C: MYCROFT
D: Yes, Wiggins?
C: YOUNG MAN
D: An immediate answer is requested, sir.
N: Mycroft inserts a monocle in his eye, opens the telegram, moves toward the desk reading it.
C: MYCROFT
D: Tell them that the three boxes go to Glennahurich, and the red runner goes to the castle.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: The three boxes to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle. Very good, sir.
N: He exits. Holmes glances toward the telegram as Mycroft puts it down on his desk. Catching his look, Mycroft turns his telegram face-down, lets the monocle drop from his eye.
C: HOLMES
D: Why don't you crumple it up and swallow it -- to make sure.
C: MYCROFT
D: My dear Sherlock, there are certain affairs that do not come within the province of the private detective. They have to be dealt with on an altogether different level.
C: HOLMES
D: In other words, you want me to stay within my limits.
C: MYCROFT
D: I do indeed.
C: HOLMES
D: Speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah Limited?
C: MYCROFT
D: Sherlock, when I said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion -- it was an order!
C: HOLMES
D: By whose authority?
C: MYCROFT
D: By the authority of Her Majesty's government. I hope I've made myself clear.
C: WATSON
D: Perfectly.
N: In his nervousness he drops his bowler, which rolls along the floor.
C: MYCROFT
D: Now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen --
C: WATSON
D: Goodbye, sir.
C: HOLMES
D: A pleasure, as always.
N: He and Watson retrieve their hats, move toward the door.
C: MYCROFT
D: Just a minute. You forgot your tool-kit.
E: to Holmes picks up Holmes' cane
N: He tosses the cane to Holmes, who catches it.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY
N: Holmes and Watson are walking toward 221B. Holmes is whistling 'Loch Lomond.'
C: WATSON
D: You will be gentle, won't you, when you tell her you're dropping the case?
C: HOLMES
D: Watson, what does the word Glennahurich suggest to you?
C: WATSON
D: Absolutely nothing.
C: HOLMES
D: It's Scottish.
C: WATSON
D: Is it?
C: HOLMES
D: And like all Scottish names, it's really a word picture. Glen means valley, na means of the, and Hurich, if memory serves me, means yew tree.
C: WATSON
D: You're just trying to impress me.
C: HOLMES
D: So the three boxes go to the Valley of the Yew Tree.
N: He resumes whistling. They start to cross the street, skirting a parked hansom. Feeding the horse is the same cabbie who fished Gabrielle out of the river, and in the passenger seat is Von Tirpitz, the craggy-faced Prussian we saw before. He stares fixedly after Holmes and Watson. Holmes and Watson come up to the door of 221B, and Watson fishes his key out. Holmes is still whistling.
C: WATSON
D: And I'll be in Scotland before ye... You are dropping the case, aren't you, Holmes?
E: singing along breaks off, looks at Holmes apprehensively
C: HOLMES
D: Open the door.
N: Watson turns the key in the lock, starts to open the door, but is stopped by a chain on the inside. Through the opening a revolver appears, aiming at them point- blank.
C: HOLMES
D: Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson -- you're liable to lose two excellent tenants.
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS - 221B BAKER STEET - DAY
N: Mrs. Hudson withdraws the gun, unhooks the chain. She is also holding an embroidery hoop. She opens the door, and Holmes and Watson step into the vestibule.
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Oh, at last. It's been a ghastly experience.
C: WATSON
D: Why? What happened?
C: MRS. HUDSON
D: Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand?
C: HOLMES
D: You'll be relieved to know it was not loaded.
E: taking gun from her
N: He starts up the stairs, followed by Watson.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, you didn't answer my question. Are you planning to disobey Mycroft's orders? He's not just your brother, you know. You'd be defying Her Majesty's government...
N: No reaction from Holmes. As they reach the landing, Gabrielle is waiting for them in the open doorway of their flat.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Any news? Did you find out anything?
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
N: Holmes and Watson step inside.
C: HOLMES
D: Let's just say I know what the next step will be.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Yes?
E: anxious
C: HOLMES
D: I want you to pack your things.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Where are we going?
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, let me caution you ---
N: Holmes has put the gun down, and is crossing to one of the book-shelves.
C: HOLMES
D: At 7:30 this evening, Dr. Watson and I are going to take you to Victoria Station, and put you on the boat-train.
E: to Gabrielle
C: GABRIELLE
D: The boat-train?
C: WATSON
D: Well, that's better.
N: Holmes has taken a railway guide from the shelf and is consulting it.
C: GABRIELLE
D: You're sending me back to Brussels? Is that it?
C: WATSON
D: Madame Valladon, you must understand...
C: GABRIELLE
D: I came here to find my husband -- you were going to help me --
E: to Holmes, agitated
C: WATSON
D: Yes, my dear. But circumstances have changed --
C: GABRIELLE
D: The great detective! Well, maybe this case is too small for you --
C: WATSON
D: On the contrary. It's being handled at a much higher level --
C: GABRIELLE
D: Well, I won't go back to Brussels. Maybe you're giving up, but I'm not. I'm going to go on looking for him. And nobody's going to stop me -- even if they try to kill me.
E: tears welling up in her eyes
C: HOLMES
D: Are you quite finished? If you recall, what I said was that we're going to put you on the boat-train -- I didn't say you were going to stay on it.
E: looking up from railway guide
C: WATSON
D: She's not?
C: HOLMES
D: At 7:30, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson will be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station. At eight-twelve, Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown accompanied by their valet John -- -- will appear at Euston Station, and board the Highland Express to Inverness.
E: a glance at Watson
C: WATSON
D: Mr. and Mrs.... ?
C: GABRIELLE
D: Thank you. I'm sorry for what I said.
E: moving toward Holmes kisses him on cheek
C: HOLMES
D: That's not necessary.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'll go and pack.
E: smiling through tears
N: She hurries off toward Watson's room.
C: WATSON
D: Maybe I should do it, since I'm the valet.
E: acidly
N: Holmes replaces the railway guide on the shelf.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, what exactly are you up to?
C: HOLMES
D: As you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot.
C: WATSON
D: But what game? Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer?
N: Without answering, Holmes heads for his bedroom.
C: WATSON
D: Or the wife of the Belgian engineer?
N: Holmes, by this time in his bedroom, shuts the door. Gabrielle reappears from the other bedroom, carrying a glove.
C: GABRIELLE
D: You don't like me very much, do you?
N: She moves toward the couch.
C: WATSON
D: Nothing of the sort. Quite the opposite... But there's more to this case than meets the eye --
N: By this time Gabrielle has picked up her parasol from the couch, and is obviously searching about.
C: WATSON
D: Looking for something?
C: GABRIELLE
D: My other glove.
C: WATSON
D: Let me help you.
N: He peers under the couch. Gabrielle moves toward the window, shakes the parasol, opens it a few times.
C: WATSON
D: Here it is.
N: He comes up from under the couch with the missing glove.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Thank you.
N: She slowly starts to shut the parasol.
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY
N: Through the upstairs window of 221B we see Gabrielle shutting the parasol. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE the hansom parked across the street, and von Tirpitz watching. He signals to the cabbie, who is back on his perch. The cabbie flicks his whip, and the hansom takes off down the street.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
N: The Highland Express is speeding northward through the moonlit landscape, its steam whistle hooting mournfully.
S: INT. SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The upper and lower berths have been made up in the small, gaslit compartment. Gabrielle's dress is on a hanger, but there is no sign of her at the moment. Holmes is just pulling a night-shirt over his head.
C: HOLMES
D: All right. You can look now.
N: Gabrielle's head appears from under the covers of the lower berth.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Am I embarrassing you, Mr. Holmes?
C: HOLMES
D: Not at all. Would it surprise you if I told you I once spent the night with 121 women?
C: GABRIELLE
D: Oh?
C: HOLMES
D: On a very interesting case -- in a harem in Constantinople.
N: He starts to climb up the ladder to the upper berth.
S: INT. THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - NIGHT
N: There is the normal complement of passengers, men, women and children, of the middle and lower classes. The only unusual occupants are a group of seven MONKS, in brown habits and cowls. Watson, in valet's livery, comes down the aisle, proceeds toward a window-seat where he has left his umbrella and bowler. The resf of the bench is occupied by monks, as is the facing bench. As Watson tries to squeeze between them, he steps on the foot of one of the monks.
C: WATSON
D: Sorry, father -- I mean, friar -- or is it abbot?
N: There is no answer from the monk. Watson picks up his bowler, settles himself in his seat, starts to fan himself with his hat. He turns sociably to the monk beside him, who is absorbed in his Bible.
C: WATSON
D: Going to Scotland, you gentlemen? So are we...
N: As he fans himself the ear-pieces of his stethoscope, which is coiled inside the crown of his bowler, dangle down. He quickly shoves them back inside.
C: WATSON
D: I'm a valet. My master and mistress and I are our way to Inverness. Ever been there? Beautiful country.
N: The monk looks up from his Bible, points to his lips, shakes his head.
C: WATSON
D: Oh, forgive me. You must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence. Trappists, I believe you're called.
N: The monk doesn't answer. Watson turns away, looks out the window -- but there's nothing to be seen. Then he folds, bored. He glances casually at the Bible in the monk's hands. The Good Book is opened to a page headed: JONAH.
C: WATSON
D: I see you're reading the book of Jonah. Funny - we were just talking about Johan this morning... Never mind.
E: realizes the hopelessness of the conversation, breaks off
N: He pulls down the shade, closes his eyes, tries to compose himself into sleep.
S: INT. SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Holmes is stretched out in the upper berth, which is in darkness. In the lower, Gabrielle is propped up against a pillow, reading a magazine by the light of a gas lamp. Other magazines are scattered across her blanket.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Women are never to be trusted entirely -- not the best of them.
N: Holmes raises himself on his elbow, glances down over the edge of his berth.
C: HOLMES
D: What did you say?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I didn't say it -- you did. According to Dr. Watson.
C: HOLMES
D: Oh.
C: GABRIELLE
D: He gave me some back issues of Strand Magazine.
C: HOLMES
D: The good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Then you deny it?
C: HOLMES
D: Not at all. I am not a whole-hearted admirer of womankind.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'm not very fond of them myself.
C: HOLMES
D: The most affectionate woman I ever knew was a murderess.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Oh?
C: HOLMES
D: It was one of those passionate affairs -- at odd hours -- right in my laboratory. And all the time, behind my back, she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband's steak and kidney pie.
C: GABRIELLE
D: You mustn't judge all women by --
C: HOLMES
D: Of course not. Only the ones I was involved with. And I don't just mean professionally -- kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Take my fiancee, for instance --
C: GABRIELLE
D: Your fiancee?
C: HOLMES
D: She was the daughter of my violin teacher -- we were engaged to be married -- the invitations were out, I was being fitted for a tail-coat -- and twenty-four hours before the wedding, she died of influenza.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'm sorry.
C: HOLMES
D: It just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted. Good night, Mrs. Ashdown.
E: a beat
N: He pulls the curtain across his berth.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Good night, Mr. Ashdown.
N: She closes her curtain, as the train whistle sounds.
S: INT. THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - NIGHT
N: Most of the passengers in the car have fallen asleep, in various uncomfortable positions, including Watson. The monk beside Watson looks at him, to make sure he's out, then rises and moves toward a monk seated apart from the others.
C: MONK
D: Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness. Die steigen dort aus. Dort muessen wir ihn finded -- den Valladon!
E: in a whisper
N: The other monk looks up. Under the cowl we recognize the face of von Tirpitz.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. INVERNESS STATION - DAY
N: The Highland Express is pulling out of the station. As the last car disappears, and the steam clears from the tracks, we see Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson on the platform. A BAGGAGEMAN is loading their luggage on a hand-cart, under Watson's supervision.
C: WATSON
D: Let's see -- two, three, four --
N: Gabrielle removes her parasol, which has been inserted under the straps of her suitcase.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'll take that.
C: HOLMES
D: How do you get to Glennahurich? How far is it?
E: to baggageman
C: BAGGAGEMAN
D: Glennahurich?
C: WATSON
D: You know -- a valley -- with a yew tree... ?
N: Gabrielle casually opens her parasol.
C: BAGGAGEMAN
D: It's about a mile out of town. Why would you be wanting to go there?
E: a beat
C: WATSON
D: Well, if it's got a view, it might be a nice place for a picnic.
C: BAGGAGEMAN
D: It's got a view, right enough -- but it's no place for a picnic.
C: HOLMES
D: Why not?
C: BAGGAGEMAN
D: Because it's a cemetary.
N: Gabrielle looks at Holmes. CAMERA PANS UP TOWARD an iron footbridge, spanning the railway tracks. Moving across it in single file are the seven cowled Trappist monks, with von Tirpitz in the lead.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - DAY
N: Under a leaden sky, the yew trees which give the place its name brood over ancient gravestones. Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come down an overgrown path, stop and look off. A rather meagre funeral procession is moving along the avenue which runs between the rows of graves. It consists of one normal-size pine coffin and two smaller ones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple of workmen. Bringing up behind is a MINISTER, with an open prayer book in his hands.
C: WATSON
D: The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?
E: a note of excitement
C: HOLMES
D: I would think so.
C: GABRIELLE
D: The two small ones -- they must be children's coffins.
N: Holmes starts to cut across between the graves, Gabrielle and Watson following. At the grave-site, the workmen are removing the coffins from the cart. There is one large grave, two smaller ones. A couple of grave-diggers stand by respectfully, caps in hands. Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up behind a nearby headstone, stop and watch. At the grave-site, the minister is finishing the service.
C: MINISTER
D: ... earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
N: In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. The workmen trundle the cart off, the minister following. The grave-diggers don their caps, pick up their shovels. From their vantage point, Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson are watching.
C: GABRIELLE
D: It's so sad.
C: HOLMES
D: Sad -- and rather odd. There are no flowers -- and no mourners.
N: The grave-diggers have finished filling in the graves when Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up.
C: HOLMES
D: Morning.
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: Morning.
E: looking up
C: HOLMES
D: Working you hard, Dad?
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: Not really. This is healthy country. Sometimes you sit around for weeks with nothing to do. Then you get three in one day.
C: HOLMES
D: What happened?
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: An accident. Aye. Father and two sons, they say -- they were found floating in the loch.
C: HOLMES
D: Local people?
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: No. Nobody around here knows them. The story is that their boat capsized in a swell -- but I don't believe it.
C: HOLMES
D: What do you believe?
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: You may think I'm an old fool or an old drunk -- but I've living around Loch Ness all my life...
C: WATSON
D: Are you trying to tell us it was the monster?
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids' faces when they were pulled out of the water -- looked like old men -- must've died of fright.
C: WATSON
D: Incredible.
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: Is it? Last Easter Sunday my wife and me, we were on our way to services, when suddenly... But what's the use?
N: He picks up a white-washed wooden cross, plants it at the head of the grave. The other grave-digger has inserted smaller crosses into the other two mounds of earth.
C: HOLMES
D: Here you are, Dad.
E: taking some coins out of his pocket hands them to the grave- digger
C: GRAVE-DIGGER
D: Thank you... You look like nice people. If you're wanting a holiday in Scotland, go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy Loch -- but stay away from Loch Ness.
N: He and his partner shoulder their shovels, move off.
C: WATSON
D: To think that people still believe in that nonsense. Here we are, living in the Nineteenth Century --
E: snorting
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'm ashamed to admit it -- but I was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys. It could possibly have anything to do with Emile.
C: HOLMES
D: It would appear not.
C: WATSON
D: However, there still remains the clue of the castle and the red runner -- wherever it may be.
N: They are about to get under way when suddenly Holmes stops them. Coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys, in knickerbockers and caps, carrying bouquets of flowers. Without a word, Holmes draws Gabrielle and Watson back to their hiding place, behind the headstone. The four boys approach the freshly-filled graves. They remove their caps, lay their flowers on each of the two small graves, then kneel down and bow their heads in prayer. From their position behind the headstone, Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have their backs to them.
C: WATSON
D: If they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers?
C: HOLMES
D: Because it's their brothers who have just been buried.
C: WATSON
D: Their brothers?
C: HOLMES
D: And they're not boys. They're as tall as they'll ever grow. Hand me some pebbles, will you?
C: WATSON
D: Pebbles.
N: He picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes, who tosses them in the direction of the graves. The pebbles strike a granite cross. At the sound, the four boys simultaneously turn their heads over their shoulders. Despite their slight bodies they have the features of mature men. Gabrielle and Watson react to the sight.
C: GABRIELLE
D: They are -- how do you say it in English? -- nains.
C: WATSON
D: Midgets.
C: HOLMES
D: Boys with the faces of old men...
E: nodding
C: WATSON
D: I still don't see --
C: HOLMES
D: Would it help if I told you they were acrobats?
C: WATSON
D: Not at all.
C: HOLMES
D: Do you remember a tumbling act -- six brothers -- missing from the circus?
C: WATSON
D: Oh, yes -- that case you turned down -- I completely forgot.
C: HOLMES
D: Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper. And stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly useless.
N: The four midgets have now risen, and putting on their caps, move off down the avenue. Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson emerge from their place of concealment.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Mr. Holmes, is those are not children, then -- ?
E: worriedly
C: HOLMES
D: Quite. The question now is -- who's in the third grave?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - NIGHT
N: The point of a crowbar digs under the edge of a coffin lid, which starts to give with a squealing protest of nails. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Holmes, standing in the large grave, from which the earth has been removed. Kneeling beside the grave, watching anxiously, are Gabrielle and Watson, the latter holding a bullseye lantern. Holmes pries the lid open, disclosing the corpse of a middle-aged man. His arms are folded across his chest, and on the third finger of his left hand is a wedding ring similar to Gabrielle's. From the picture of him we have seen earlier, we recognize the face as that of Emile Valladon. Gabrielle lets out a piercing scream, collapses in a faint. Watson catches her.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes! She's fainted.
C: HOLMES
D: Hand me that lantern.
E: preoccupied
N: Watson passes down the lantern, and Holmes slowly shines the beam along the length of the coffin.
C: WATSON
D: It is Valladon, isn't it?
C: HOLMES
D: Obviously. What is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green --
N: The lantern beam now reveals that laid out at Valladon's feet are three canaries -- their plumage bleached a grey- white color.
C: HOLMES
D: -- and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin. White canaries.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN
N: An open carriage is proceeding along the driveway toward the hotel, scatting a flock of sheep grazing nearby. Watson is sitting beside the coachman. Holmes and Gabrielle are in the passenger seat, their luggage is strapped to the back. Through the trees which line the road we glimpse Loch Ness, which is partly obscured by a low-lying mist. The carriage pulls up in front of the hotel, which is identified by a sign above the entrance, and Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle get out. CLOSE SHOT - HOTEL REGISTER Holmes' hand is writing: Mr. And Mrs. Ashdown and valet, London.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
N: The MANAGER, in kilts, is just opening the curtains -- disclosing a view of the mist-shrouded lake through the window. The room is on the second floor, and is furnished in a style which has been described as Scotch Baronial -- twin beds with a night-table between them, wardrobe, chiffonier, desk, a couple of chairs, and several mounted stags' heads. Holmes and Gabrielle are in the room, Watson is bringing their bags through the door.
C: MANAGER
D: You have a lovely view of the loch from here -- as soon as the morning mist rolls away. If you've a mind to do any sight-seeing, here's a guide to the local points of interest.
E: crosses to desk, picks up guide book
C: HOLMES
D: Thank you.
N: The manager starts toward the door, nodding to Watson.
C: MANAGER
D: This way, please. I will show you to your room.
N: Watson picks up his suitcase, follows him.
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
N: The manager and Watson come out, the latter shutting the door.
C: WATSON
D: I suppose you're putting me in the basement.
C: MANAGER
D: No, your room is in the attic.
C: WATSON
D: Good.
C: MANAGER
D: It's the privy that's in the basement.
N: Watson grunts as the manager leads him up a narrow flight of stairs.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Holmes removes his coat, turns to Gabrielle.
C: HOLMES
D: May I have your wedding ring, please?
N: Gabrielle tearfully removes her ring, hands it to Holmes. From his vest pocket he now produces Valladon's ring -- the copper has a greenish tinge to it. He crosses to the window, compares the two rings in the light. Gabrielle sinks down on the edge of one of the beds.
C: HOLMES
D: Just as I thought. There is a distinct difference in color between your ring and your husband's. Which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning... I wish you would stop that. Stop it!
E: a sob from Gabrielle Gabrielle is now crying crossing to her
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'm sorry.
C: HOLMES
D: I know it's not easy. But you must remember that we're that nice couple from London, on Holiday in the Highlands.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'll try.
E: a final sniffle
C: HOLMES
D: That's much better.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Thank you.
N: She manages a tentative smile. Holmes looks at her for a long moment, then --
C: HOLMES
D: Now, if I may proceed without further interruptions --
E: gruffly
C: WATSON'S VOICE
D: Mr. Ashdown!
E: from off
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Watson comes dashing down the narrow stairs from the attic, races toward teh door of Holmes' room.
C: WATSON
D: Mr. Ashdown!
N: He flings the door open.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Watson bursts in breathlessly.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes! I saw it! I saw it from the attic! It's out there in the lake!
C: HOLMES
D: You saw what?
C: WATSON
D: The telescope. Where's the telescope?
E: looking around desperately
C: HOLMES
D: What did you see?
C: WATSON
D: The monster!
C: HOLMES
D: The monster?
N: Watson fishes a small telescope out of Holmes' suitcase, rushes through the open French window to the balcony.
S: EXT. BALCONY - DAY
N: Watson focuses the telescope on the lake. LOCH NESS THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY Through the swirling mist which clings to the surface of the lake, a shadowy figure with a long, monster-like neck can be see gliding along.
S: EXT. BALCONY - DAY
N: Watson almost drops the telescope in excitement.
C: WATSON
D: There it is! There it is!
N: Holmes joins him on the balcony.
C: WATSON
D: Look for yourself.
N: He hands the telescope to Holmes. Gabrielle comes up to the window behind them. Holmes trains the telescope on the lake.
C: WATSON
D: See it? See it?
N: LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY Holmes' eye slowly scans the lake, but there is no sign of Watson's monster -- just the rolling mist.
S: EXT. BALCONY - DAY
N: Holmes lowers the telescope.
C: HOLMES
D: I see nothing.
C: WATSON
D: Nothing?
N: He grabs the telescope from Holmes, looks toward the lake.
C: WATSON
D: It's gone.
C: HOLMES
D: Gone? Maybe it was never there.
C: WATSON
D: I swear to you -- I saw it -- clear as anything --
C: HOLMES
D: Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are living in the Nineteenth Century --
N: He steps back into the room.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Watson comes halfway through the French window.
C: WATSON
D: Maybe that grave-digger was right -- the swell, and the boat overturning --
C: HOLMES
D: Monsieur Valladon may have been found in the lake -- but he did not drown. He died of asphyxiation.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Asphyxiation.
C: HOLMES
D: There is only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries -- chlorine gas.
E: holding up wedding rings
C: WATSON
D: That may be. But the fact remains that I saw something out there.
C: HOLMES
D: A figment of your imagination. Now let us be logical. The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle -- The question is, which castle?
E: picks up guide book from desk, opens it to map
C: WATSON
D: You call yourself logical? You're the least logical man I know.
C: HOLMES
D: Am I?
C: WATSON
D: How can you say it's a figment of my imagination, when for years you've been saying I have no imagination whatsoever!
N: He looks at Holmes almost triumphantly.
T: CUT TO:
N: SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY Holmes, Gabrielle, and Watson bicycling away from the hotel. Holmes, in knickerbockers and a Norfolk jacket, and Gabrielle, holding her parasol, are on a tandem. Watson is behind them, on a bicycle with a picnic basket attached to the rack. He is in his valet's outfit, with metal clips around his trouser cuffs. The three of them bicycling past a long stone wall. They pedal up to an imposing castle. Holmes dismounts, knocks on the front door. Our trio bicycling through a copse of trees. They approach another castle. On a steep road, they ride through a flock of sheep. They are proceeding along a causeway, away from a third castle.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LAKE SHORE - DAY
N: Holmes and Gabrielle are sitting on a blanket, the contents of the picnic basket spread before them, having lunch. Watson is pouring the wine. Their bicycles are resting nearby.
C: WATSON
D: We have so far investigated eight drafty castles -- had our bicycles attacked by sheep and our ears assaulted by bagpipes -- and we are exactly where we started.
C: HOLMES
D: Would you like some cranberry sauce, dear?
E: to Gabrielle
C: GABRIELLE
D: Yes, dear.
C: HOLMES
D: Would you pass the cranberry sauce, please, John?
C: WATSON
D: Yes, dear.
N: As he does so, he catches sight of something o.s.
C: WATSON
D: I say there. Good afternoon. Remember me?
E: calling
N: On the road above, approaching a bridge which spans the lake where it narrows into a stream, are the seven Trappist monks, walking slowly in single file. Watson waves to them, but the monks pay no attention to him.
C: WATSON
D: Some chaps I met on the train. We had a long conversation -- or rather, I had a long conversation -- because they're not allowed to talk -- Trappists, you know. Just study their Bibles. You'll never guess what the one next to me was reading -- the Book of Jonah -- isn't that odd?
E: to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: Quite.
E: looking after the monks
N: As he turns back, he notices that Gabrielle is manipulating her parasol in the air.
C: HOLMES
D: What is it, dear? What's the matter?
C: GABRIELLE
D: A bee.
N: She continues to work the parasol, alternately opening it and partially closing it. On the bridge von Tirpitz, who is at the rear of the file of monks, glances back toward the lakeshore.

S: EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - DAY
N: On a promontory jutting into Loch Ness stand the remains of a medieval fortress. Around the Tower, the Motte, and the ruins of the East wall, wooden scaffolding has been erected, and a couple of dozen men are engaged in what appears to be repair work. Amidst the rubble of the Nether Bailey, an encampment of tents has been set up. Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come bicycling up along a fence on the heights overlooking the castle, dismount in front of the locked gates. Attached to the gatepost is a sign reading: WARNING: No Unauthorized Person Permitted Beyond This Point.
C: WATSON
D: Well, I don't think we have to bother with this castle. It's just a pile of rubble.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Then why are they taking precautions?
N: She points to the sign -- and to a guard coming up the driveway, with a couple of huge mastiffs on leashes.
C: HOLMES
D: Why, indeed? Let's go.
E: turning the tandem around
C: WATSON
D: Go where?
C: HOLMES
D: When rebuffed at the front door, one's only choice is to try the tradesmen's entrance.
N: They move off.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - DAY
N: Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson are coming up a path from the lakeside, leading their bicycles. They lean the cycles against a ruined wall, start across the courtyard. A middle-aged MAN in kilts emerges from the tumbled-down gatehouse, comes toward them.
C: GUIDE
D: Sorry. No visitors allowed.
C: HOLMES
D: Are you the guide here?
C: GUIDE
D: Yes. The castle is closed to the public while work is going on.
C: HOLMES
D: What are they doing?
C: GUIDE
D: It's being restored by the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.
C: HOLMES
D: Too bad. I particularly wanted my wife to see Urquhart Castle. The tower is one of the most interesting examples of -- about 1400, wasn't it?
C: GUIDE
D: That's right.
C: HOLMES
D: Let me see -- was it built under James the Second or James the Third?
C: GUIDE
D: The Thrid... If you come back next year, we'll be all done here, and I'll be glad to show you around.
C: HOLMES
D: Thank you.
N: As the three of them move off, a canvas-topped wagon comes through the stone archway, stops at the front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard.
C: WATSON
D: Pleasant sort, isn't he?
C: HOLMES
D: Pleasant, but ignorant. He was off one hundred years and one James. It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth.
E: taps guide-book in his pocket
C: GABRIELLE
D: If he's an official guide, shouldn't he know... ?
C: HOLMES
D: If he's an official guide.
N: They have now reached the wall against which they left their bicycles. Suddenly Holmes stops, attracted by the sound of birds chirping.
C: HOLMES
D: Listen... Do you hear anything, Watson?
C: WATSON
D: No. Those birds are making too much of a racket.
E: concentrating
C: HOLMES
D: They're not just birds -- they're our old friends.
E: looking off
N: Watson and Gabrielle follow his gaze. From the back of the wagon, the carriers have removed the small bird-cage we saw in the mail-drop on Ashdown Street. They hand it to a workman, who starts up the steps with it. To another couple of workmen they pass down an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glass bottles protected by wicker. Stencilled on the wooden slate of the crate are the words: SULPHURIC ACID - CORROSIVE. Holmes is watching thoughtfully, Gabrielle and Watson are puzzled.
C: WATSON
D: Sulphuric acid?
C: GABRIELLE
D: The more we find out the less sense it makes.
C: HOLMES
D: To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense. Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine gas. Would you mind clasping your hands, Watson?
E: a beat
C: WATSON
D: Like this?
E: obeying
C: HOLMES
D: A little lower... Thank you.
N: Watson has lowered his clasped hands, and Holmes uses them as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding of the nearby wall. Reaching the top, he looks off in the direction of the tower. The workman carrying the canary cage, and the two carrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the tower. A draw-bridge comes down, and the three men cross the moat and enter the tower.
C: HOLMES
D: That tower may be more interesting than I thought -- and not just architecturally.
E: looking off
N: Out of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the two mastiffs on leashes. The dogs start to snarl viciously.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, I have a feeling we're redundant here.
N: Holmes leaps down from the scaffolding, wheels the tandem around, starts back in the direction from which they came. Gabrielle follows. Watson hurries after them with his bicycle, casting anxious glances over his shoulder as the dogs continue barking.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. LOCH NESS - EARLY EVENING
N: The sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there is still light in the sky. An ominous mist is beginning to settle on the water. Gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her parasol in her lap. She is wearing Holmes' Norfolk jacket over her dress to ward off the chill. On the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes, the latter in his waistcoat. Their oars are pulled in, and they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the opposite side of the lake.
C: WATSON
D: We have now observed the castle from the front, from the back, from the side, from land, from water... what now? Are you planning to spend the night out here?
C: HOLMES
D: If necessary.
C: WATSON
D: You're going to catch your death of cold. Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last case were a case of pneumonia? Sorry.
E: to Gabrielle with an embarrassed chuckle
N: Gabrielle glances past them, and her eyes widen.
C: GABRIELLE
D: What's that?
E: pointing off
N: Holmes and Watson turn their heads. About half a mile away, moving in and out of patches of drifting mist, is Watson's monster, its long reptillian
T: neck cutting through the water.
N: Watson leaps to his feet.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes!
N: Holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat.
C: HOLMES
D: Quick, Watson. After it!
N: He grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in. They strain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept the monster. Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying to peer past them through the curtains of mist. The monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarter of a mile away. Suddenly Watson stops rowing.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, what are we doing? We should be going away from it.
C: HOLMES
D: Keep rowing, dammit!
N: Watson resumes pulling on his oar. As they row, Holmes looks over his shoulder. The monster has started to submerge. Its head disappears beneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leaves behind soon trails off into the mist. Holmes ships his oar.
C: HOLMES
D: We've lost it.
C: WATSON
D: At least you admit there's an it, not just a figment of my imagination.
E: stops rowing
C: HOLMES
D: Quiet.
N: He listens intently. There is only the sound of water slapping against the side of the boat. The mist is heavier now, and billowing around them.
C: HOLMES
D: Do you have your stethoscope with you?
E: to Watson
C: WATSON
D: Never without it.
N: He removes his bowler, unwinds the stethoscope from the inside the crown, hands it to Holmes. Holmes plugs in the ear-pieces, leans over the side of the boat, extends the other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the water.
C: WATSON
D: What is it?
C: HOLMES
D: I can hear something...
N: We become aware of the faint beating of engines, accompanied by a bubbling sound.
C: HOLMES
D: It's getting closer -- closer --
N: Suddenly the surface of the water breaks, about twenty yards away from them, and the head and neck of the monster rear up from the depths. Watson is first to notice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises. Gabrielle sees it and screams. Watson grabs an oar, throws it at the monster as it comes past. The backwash hits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are spilled into the lake. The monster moves away from them, heading in the general direction of the castle. It disappears into the mist. Holmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees Gabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.
C: HOLMES
D: Are you all right?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I lost my parasol.
C: HOLMES
D: Where's Watson?
N: He glances around, sees Watson's bowler floating nearby, swims over to it.
C: HOLMES
D: Watson?
N: He lifts the hat -- but Watson isn't under it. As Gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, Watson clambers over the other side. After a moment Holmes joins them, and they sit there, sopping wet and breathing heavily.
C: WATSON
D: I have come face to face with man-eating tigers -- I was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants -- India, you know -- but I wasn't half as frightened. This beast seems to have a personal grudge against us.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I just hope it doesn't come back.
C: HOLMES
D: I don't think it will. Look!
E: pointing off
N: They glance in the indicated direction. There is no sign of the monster. But the mist has momentarily lifted to reveal the castle, and an odd sight greets their eyes -- the wooden scaffolding in front of the tower is slowly rising into the air.
C: WATSON
D: What strange goings-on.
E: amazed
C: HOLMES
D: Not really. My guess is that the monster, after a hard day's work, has returned home for his supper.
N: The scaffolding in front of the tower slowly descends back into the place, as mist once more engulfs the castle.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Holmes, in a different suit of clothes, is pacing across the room, whistling the main theme from "Swan Lake." He stops before the open French window, gazes out toward the lake. Gabrielle is propped up in bed, a blanket drawn up to her chin, watching him. Watson, who has changed into a pair of kilts, is standing in front of the fireplace, warming his backside. Gabrielle glances at Watson, suppresses a giggle.
C: WATSON
D: Yes, I know. But would you believe that you can't borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place?
N: Holmes resumes pacing, and Watson becomes aware of his whistling.
C: WATSON
D: Would you like to confide in us?
N: No answer from Holmes. Watson turns to Gabrielle.
C: WATSON
D: Whenever he starts whistling, I know he's getting close to a solution.
C: HOLMES
D: It's nothing new, actually. We've come across this situation before.
C: WATSON
D: We have? Where?
C: HOLMES
D: At the ballet.
C: WATSON
D: Ballet?
C: HOLMES
D: There's a lake -- and there's a castle -- and there's a swan that isn't really a swan -- or, in this case, a monster that isn't really a monster --
C: WATSON
D: Then what is it?
C: HOLMES
D: What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulphuric acid, and has an engine for a heart?
C: GABRIELLE
D: An engine?
C: HOLMES
D: The stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument, and water is an excellent conductor of sound. There is no doubt that what we are dealing with is a mechanical monster.
C: WATSON
D: Oh?
C: HOLMES
D: Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart, it also has artificial lungs. Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake, it uses some form of air pump.
C: GABRIELLE
D: You think my husband was involved in all this?
C: HOLMES
D: Yes, Madame Valladon. I'm sure of it.
C: WATSON
D: But why would anybody build a mechanical monster? Just to scare people?
C: HOLMES
D: Not very likely.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband? And why was he buried anonymously?
C: HOLMES
D: I think I have a pretty good notion of what they're up to -- the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments -- better known as the Diogenes Club.
C: WATSON
D: The Diogenes Club?
N: There is a knock on the door.
C: HOLMES
D: Come in.
N: The door opens and the hotel manager enters, holding a magnum of champagne.
C: MANAGER
D: Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne for you.
C: HOLMES
D: A bottle of champagne? I didn't order it.
E: crossing to him
C: MANAGER
D: No, indeed. You are to deliver it. These are my instructions.
N: He hands the magnum to Holmes.
C: HOLMES
D: Instructions from whom? Deliver it where?
C: MANAGER
D: I wouldn't know, sir. But there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs.
C: HOLMES
D: Are you sure you have the right Mr. Ashdown?
C: MANAGER
D: Quite sure, Mr. Holmes.
E: flatly
N: He turns and exits. Holmes taps the bottle of champagne thoughtfully.
C: HOLMES
D: Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act.
C: WATSON
D: I don't like the sound of it.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Please be careful.
N: As Holmes starts toward the door, Watson reaches into his sporran.
C: WATSON
D: You'd better take this with you.
N: He produces a revolver, holds it out to Holmes. Holmes ignores it, exits.
S: EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - NIGHT
N: A gig is waiting in front of the entrance, and leaning against it is the guide we saw earlier at Urquhart. Holmes comes out, carrying the champagne bottle.
C: HOLMES
D: Who's minding the castle?
C: GUIDE
D: You'd better get on. It's late.
N: Holmes climbs into the gig, and the guide moutns the seat beside him.
C: HOLMES
D: Where are we going? Some sort of party?
C: GUIDE
D: You won't be disappointed in the guest list.
C: HOLMES
D: Who's the host?
C: GUIDE
D: Jonah.
N: He flicks the reins. The horse starts off at a trot, and the gig turns into the driveway.
S: EXT. MOVING GIG - NIGHT
N: As they drive along, Holmes glances at the guide, who is grim and uncommunicative.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ROAD LEADING TO CASTLE - NIGHT
N: The gig, with its two passengers, proceeds along the lakeshore, approaching the entrance to Urquhart.
S: EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - NIGHT
N: A workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to the ruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway. The guide reins up the horse in front of the steps leading to the inner courtyard -- which are now covered with a narrow red carpet. The guide nods to Holmes, who dismounts, starts up the steps, examining the red carpet. As he reaches the top, he looks off. The strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard, lit by torches planted in the ground. A couple of workmen are are unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance of the tower. As Holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens and Mycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat.
C: MYCROFT
D: Mr. Ashdown, I presume.
C: HOLMES
D: The red runner, I presume.
E: turning
N: (indicates carpet) You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble just for me.
C: MYCROFT
D: It's not for you. McKeller. May I have the champagne, please?
E: calling into tent to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: 1886 -- not a very good vintage, is it?
E: handing him bottle
C: MYCROFT
D: Mediocre. But then again, it's not for drinking.
N: A black-suited MAN emerges from the ten, and Mycroft gives him the champagne.
C: MYCROFT
D: Tie it up, will you?
N: The man moves off toward the tower. Mycroft pulls back the flap of the tent.
C: MYCROFT
D: In here.
N: Holmes passes inside, Mycroft following.
S: INT. TENT - NIGHT
N: It is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge- pole. There are several cots, one of them with the bedding rolled up. Resting on the stripped cot is a trunk with the name E. VALLADON painted on it. Lying on a table, among a group of engineering models, are Gabrielle's parasol and Watson's stethoscope. There are also a couple of drafting tables, with plans and blueprints tacked to them. Holmes moves around the tent, taking all this in.
C: HOLMES
D: Interesting -- and educational.
C: MYCROFT
D: Despite my most emphatic warning, you persisted in meddling. It would have served you right if you'd all drowned.
C: HOLMES
D: Sorry to be so unobliging. E. Valladon... H'mm.
E: stops beside torch
C: MYCROFT
D: I imagine this belongs to the pretty lady, and this belongs to your valet... We found them floating in the lake.
E: indicating parasol and stethoscope
C: HOLMES
D: Speaking about things floating in the lake --
C: MYCROFT
D: How much do you know -- or think you know?
C: HOLMES
D: I think you're testing some sort of underwater craft -- camouflauged to mislead the gullible. I think it's an experimental model, operated by a crew of midgets. I think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries, and uses canaries to detect escaping gas... Altogether a strange contraption.
C: MYCROFT
D: Not quite that unique. Right now, four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible. But none of them could solve the critical problem -- how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective.
C: HOLMES
D: What does the Good Book say? "And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights."
C: MYCROFT
D: That was our goal. And thanks to Valladon's air-pump, we got a jump on the rest of them. It's a highly complex system of filtration -- so we had a series of trials --
C: HOLMES
D: And at least one error.
C: MYCROFT
D: During a test run in Moray Firth, pressure caused a leak in the hull. Sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas. Before they could reach the surface, Valladon and the crew were dead.
C: HOLMES
D: So you had them buried in unmarked graves, to preserve your secret.
C: MYCROFT
D: It was essential to keep the information from your client.
C: HOLMES
D: You went to all those lengths to prevent Madame Valladon from fiding her husband?
C: MYCROFT
D: Your client isn't Madame Valladon -- it's the Imperial German Government. They were after the Belgian engineer -- or rather, his invention. They knew he was employed by us, but they couldn't find out where -- so they enlisted the best brain in England to help them. You, my dear brother, have been working for the Wilhelmstrasse.
C: HOLMES
D: And Madame Valladon -- what part did she play in all this?
C: MYCROFT
D: Madame Valladon is dead.
C: HOLMES
D: Dead?
N: Mycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid.
C: MYCROFT
D: The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago, in Brussels. This is Gabrielle Valladon.
N: He hands Holmes a small, framed photograph. Holmes looks at it with apprehension, as well he should: the picture is of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorous Gabrielle. Holmes lowers the photograph. Behind it, Mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance.
C: MYCROFT
D: The woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night -- apparently fished out of the Thames -- and apparently suffering from amnesia -- is, in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of their most skillful agents. Am I going too fast for one of the "best brains in England?"
C: HOLMES
D: Go on.
N: As Mycroft continues, Holmes picks up Ilse's water-soaked parasol and examines it.
C: MYCROFT
D: They planted her on you quite neatly, I must admit, so that you could lead them to their objective, the air pump. Very much like using a hog to find truffles. And now perhaps you'd care to join me. I am expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral.
S: EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT
N: A coach and escort approach the castle. Painted on the door of the coach are the initials "V.R."
S: INT. CASTLE COURTYARD
N: The entourage enters the castle courtyard and stops. Footmen open the door and bow to the lone passenger. Waiting on top of the steps, outside the tent, are Mycroft and Holmes. Lined up on the other side of the torch-lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists, in their best clothes. Out of the coach steps a familiar figure -- Her Majesty, QUEEN VICTORIA, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India. She is 69 years old, and dressed entirely in black. Mycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her.
C: MYCROFT
D: Your Majesty.
N: He bows. The Queen extends her hand to him, and he touches it.
C: MYCROFT
D: I trust you had a pleasant journey, Ma'am.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: It was long and it was tedious. And it had better be worth our while, Mr. Holmes.
C: MYCROFT
D: I can assure you, Ma'am, it will be.
N: A lady-in-waiting and a uniformed equerry have now descended from the coach. Mycroft leads the party up the steps.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen?
C: MYCROFT
D: We call it a submersible, Ma'am. It travels under water.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Under water? What a fantastic idea.
N: They have now reached the top of the steps.
C: MYCROFT
D: Ma'am, may present some of the scientists who were responsible for this achievement. J.W. Ferguson, naval architect --
C: FIRST SCIENTIST
D: Your Majesty.
E: bowing
C: MYCROFT
D: Professor Simpson, our leading expert on hydraulics --
C: SECOND SCIENTIST
D: Your Majesty.
E: bowing
C: MYCROFT
D: W.W. Prescott, co-inventor of the revolving periscope --
C: THIRD SCIENTIST
D: Your Majesty.
E: bowing
C: MYCROFT
D: And this is Sir Arthur Grisby, our authority on maritime ballistics --
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: We don't claim to understand any of this. But England is proud of you, gentlemen. To think that man can now observe fish in their native habitat --
C: MYCROFT
D: Well, not exactly, Ma'am --
E: trying to correct her
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: -- and underwater plants and coral reefs -- Young man -- what was your contribution to this project?
E: noticing Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: I'm afraid it was rather negligible, Your Majesty.
C: MYCROFT
D: This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma'am.
E: to the Queen
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Ah, yes. Sherlock Holmes. We have been following your exploits with great interest.
N: Holmes bows, touches the Queen's extended hand.
C: HOLMES
D: Thank you, Ma'am.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases at the moment?
C: HOLMES
D: In a manner of speaking, Ma'am.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: When can we expect to read Dr. Watson's account of the case?
C: HOLMES
D: I hope never, Ma'am. It has not been one of my more successful endeavors.
N: Mycroft signals to a bagpiper, who starts playing HIELAN' LADDIE.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Ah, the ceremonies are about to begin. Now where is this underwater ship of yours?
E: to Mycroft
C: MYCROFT
D: In the dungeon, Ma'am.
E: pointing to tower
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: The dungeon? What a peculiar place to keep it. Well, let us get on with it, gentlemen.
E: turning to the others
N: Mycroft leads the Queen along the red runner toward the tower. Holmes follows, then the lady-in-waiting and the equerry, then the scientists. As they cross the inner courtyard, the Highland piper falls in ahead of the procession, leads them toward the drawbridge. Then he steps aside, as the royal party crosses the drawbridge and passes through the door of the tower.
S: INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT
N: A high-ceilinged rock chamber, with a spiral iron staircase leading down. The floor is a concrete ramp, the lower end of it covered with water. Beyond is the entrance from the Loch, camouflaged by scaffolding and vegetation. On the upper part of the ramp is a small, primitive submarine, resting on wheels. Prominently lettered on the bow is the name H.M.S. JONAH, and suspended by a rope from the prow is the magnum of champagne which Holmes delivered. Along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fitted over the conning tower is the head and neck of the "monster" we saw in the lake. Present are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by an officer. As the royal party comes down the spiral staircase, the officer snaps to attention. Mycroft is in the lead, followed by the Queen, Holmes, the lady-in- waiting, the equerry and the scientists.
C: MYCROFT
D: There she, Ma'am. Her Majesty's Ship Jonah.
N: The four surviving midgets appear on the deck, in wool jerseys and navy caps. They start pulling on a chain which slowly raises the detachable head-and-neck of the monster toward the ceiling, disclosing the conning tower and the periscope.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: And what, may we ask, is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle?
C: MYCROFT
D: It's merely a decoy, Ma'am.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Oh. To frighten away the sharks, we imagine.
C: MYCROFT
D: Something of the sort... The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible.
N: A SAILOR of normal height appears on the deck of the sub.
C: SAILOR
D: Stand to.
N: The midgets scramble down the hatch.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Aren't they rather small for sailors?
C: MYCROFT
D: They are. But because of the size of the craft, the Navy made an exception.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: They should make it a rule. It's quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes.
N: There is the sound of the engines starting. Mycroft leads the Queen to an open bulkhead in the side of the sub, with Holmes and rest of the party close behind. Inside, all is noise and confusion. Metal rods are dipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid, complicated machinery is driving the propeller shaft, bellows are inflating and deflating, etc. The midgets are at their stations in the cramped quarters, pulling switches, oiling the engines, operating the periscope. Overhead is a cageful of canaries, all chirping away. Mycroft points out the various features to the Queen.
C: MYCROFT
D: This is the main engine, which propels it under water at the rate of two knots -- the stabilizing mechanism -- the multi- stage compressor -- the ballast tank trimmer -- the air-pump which filters and recirculates the air --
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: How charming.
C: MYCROFT
D: The air pump, Ma'am?
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: The canaries. Must make the crew feel at home.
E: pointing
C: MYCROFT
D: Yes, Ma'am. These are the levers for firing the torpedoes, which are accurate up to as much as 120 feet -- the periscope for scanning the surface of the water --
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: But where is the glass bottom?
C: MYCROFT
D: The what, Ma'am?
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: The glass bottom.
C: HOLMES
D: You know -- to see the fist --
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: -- and the plants and the corals --
C: MYCROFT
D: That's not quite the idea, Ma'am. H.M.S. Jonah is being commissioned as a warship.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: A warship? Stop that noise. Stop it!
E: waving her hand
N: At a signal from Mycroft, the sub engines are turned off.
C: MYCROFT
D: Ma'am, if I may explain --
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: You had better.
C: MYCROFT
D: The Admiralty regards this craft as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare. It can seek out enemy ships and destroy them -- with these torpedoes -- while remaining completely invisible.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: You mean in can fire at other vessels while under water?
C: MYCROFT
D: Yes, Ma'am.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Without any warning?
C: MYCROFT
D: That is correct, Ma'am.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: And without showing her colors?
C: MYCROFT
D: Indeed, Ma'am.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Mr. Holmes, we are not amused. It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English, and it is in very poor taste. We will have none of it!
E: Mycroft stares at her
C: MYCROFT
D: I beg your pardon, Ma'am?
N: He exchanges a look with Holmes.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Sometimes we despair of the state of the world. What will scientists think of next?
C: MYCROFT
D: That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a dirigible --
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?
C: MYCROFT
D: A rigid balloon, which could fly over London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace. It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Second.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like that.
C: MYCROFT
D: We have conclusive proof, Ma'am. Our agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he was apprehended before he could cross the border.
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: Nevertheless, we don't want any part of this beastly invention. Get rid of it! Scuttle it! The sooner the better.
E: indicating sub
C: MYCROFT
D: May I point out, Ma'am --
C: QUEEN VICTORIA
D: And don't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall write a very sharp note to the Kaiser. Now we wish to return to Balmoral.
E: to equerry
N: She starts toward the spiral staircase. The equerry precedes her up the stairs, the lady-in-waiting follows, the scientists trail after them. Mycroft and Holmes linger behind.
C: HOLMES
D: Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman. What a shame.
E: Mycroft is staring at the sub
N: All that superb engineering, and all that cunning espionage, for nought.
C: MYCROFT
D: Not necessarily. If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them?
C: HOLMES
D: Give it to them?
C: MYCROFT
D: Invite them aboard for the final journey -- seven hundred feet -- straight down.
C: HOLMES
D: And how are you going to arrange that?
C: MYCROFT
D: I'm rather counting on you to do it. Since you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.
N: O.s., the bagpiper resumes playing.
C: MYCROFT
D: Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?
N: He starts up the spiral staircase. Holmes follows slowly and thoughtfully.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN
N: The gig, with the quide driving and Holmes beside him, comes up the driveway, stops in front of the entrance. Holmes hops down, and twirling Gabrielle's parasol in his hand, walks into the hotel.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
N: In the half-light, Gabrielle can be seen asleep in her bed. She is wearing the pink negligee with the maribou feathers, which has slipped halfway off her shoulders. The other bed has not been slept in. The door from the corridor opens and Holmes steps in, carrying the parasol. He crosses to Gabrielle's bed, looks down at her for a long moment, adjusts the negligee with the tip of the parasol. The he moves to the French window, opens it, glances out. LAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN The seven Trappist monks are standing on the shore, silhouetted against the water, watching the hotel.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
N: Holmes withdraws from the window , looks at the sleeping Gabrielle, then casually swings the parasol, hitting a metal lamp-shade overhead. Gabrielle sits up abruptly in bed, clutching her negligee around her.
C: HOLMES
D: Sorry about that. But as long as you're up -- what is the German word for castle? Schloss, isn't it?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I think so.
E: carefully
C: HOLMES
D: And how would you say under the castle? Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss?
C: GABRIELLE
D: I don't know. My German isn't that good.
C: HOLMES
D: Your Trappist friends are out there waiting to hear from you -- it's a chilly morning -- we don't want to keep them standing around too long, do we, Fraulein Hoffmanstal? Come now. It's too late to play cat and mouse.
E: indicating Gabrielle looks at him without answering
C: GABRIELLE
D: Unter dem Schloss.
E: flatly
C: HOLMES
D: Thank you. Here's your signalling device -- it's a bit damp, I'm afraid -- would you care to let them know where they can find the submersible? No? Then I'll just have to do it myself. I only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion.
E: holding out parasol Gabrielle makes no move to take the parasol moving toward window
N: Keeping well to one side of the open window, he extends the parasol outside, opens it, starts sending out a series of long and short signals. LAKEFRONT - DAWN von Tirpitz and the other monks strain their eyes in the direction of the hotel. HOTEL - FROM MONKS' ANGLE - DAWN Outside the hotel window, Gabrielle's parasol can be seen flashing the message UNTER DEM SCHLOSS in Morse code -- but it is not apparent that Holmes is doing the signalling.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
N: As Holmes continues opening and closing the parasol, Gabrielle gets out of bed, comes up beside him. Holmes finishes the message, shuts the parasol, draws it back into the room. Then he looks out the window. LAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN The monks turn away from the hotel, and with von Tirpitz in the lead, move off along the shore.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
N: Holmes steps back from the window, faces Gabrielle.
C: HOLMES
D: Well, it's up to the good monks now. You can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal.
C: GABRIELLE
D: You're all wrong about me. My name isn't Hoffmanstal.
C: HOLMES
D: It isn't?
C: GABRIELLE
D: It's von Hoffmanstal.
C: HOLMES
D: I stand corrected.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I suppose once they're in the castle... It must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappists walking into a trap.
E: glancing toward window
C: HOLMES
D: It's more amusing than that. Once in the castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance -- it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards.
C: GABRIELLE
D: You mean you're going to let them have the air-pump?
E: skeptically
C: HOLMES
D: Better than that. We're going to let them have the submersible. They will find it with its engines running, all set to go. I assume they're all expert sailors? And since there is a German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland, I expect they'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Did you say try to?
C: HOLMES
D: I would suggest you get your things together. Mycroft will be here to take you into custody.
N: He opens her suitcase, which is on the baggage rack at the foot of the bed. Gabrielle watches him for a beat, then crosses to the wardrobe, starts taking her clothes out.
C: GABRIELLE
D: I never had you fooled for a moment, did I? You knew right from the beginning -- when the cabbie brought me to Baker Street.
C: HOLMES
D: Let me see -- not quite that soon.
N: He stretches out on the bed.
C: GABRIELLE
D: It's so funny. I asked for this assignment, you know. I was scheduled to go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best. I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer game.
C: HOLMES
D: Close enough.
C: GABRIELLE
D: You're just being kind. I failed miserably.
C: HOLMES
D: We all have occasional failures. Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes about mine.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Watson, back in his valet's outfit again, comes bounding down the narrow stairs from the attic, races toward the door of Holmes' room.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes! Holmes!
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Bright sunlight now floods the room. Gabrielle, fully dressed, is standing in front of the mirror, putting on her hat. Her packed bag has been set out in the middle of the room, and resting on it is the parasol. The door bursts open and Watson dashes in.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes!
N: In his haste he trips over the bag, goes down. As he picks himself up again, Gabrielle points toward the balcony.
S: EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY
N: Holmes is leaning against the parapet, scanning the lake through his telescope. Watson appears through the open French window behind him.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes, I saw it again -- that thing -- it came from the castle -- it's out there
E: excitedly
N: LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY A trial of bubbles is moving along the surface. Suddenly there is a muffled explosion from below, and a geyser of water shoots up into the air.
S: EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY
N: Holmes slowly lowers the telescope.
C: HOLMES
D: It was out there. Now it's gone.
C: WATSON
D: Gone?
C: HOLMES
D: Forever. Look for yourself.
N: LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY There is a great turbulence in the water. Up to the surface pops the bottle of christening champagne, with rope and ribbons still attached. Then a copy of the Bible pops up.
S: EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY
C: WATSON
D: A bottle of champagne?... and a Bible?...
C: HOLMES
D: That's all that's left of H.M.S. Jonah.
N: He steps through the window as a puzzled Watson lowers the telescope.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Watson follows Holmes in from the balcony.
C: HOLMES
D: It would seem that somebody carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible. What a fitting end for Trappists -- now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake.
C: WATSON
D: Do you know what he's talking about?
E: to Gabrielle
N: Through the open doorway comes Mycroft. In the corridor behind him is one of his aides.
C: MYCROFT
D: Fraulein von Hoffmanstal?
C: GABRIELLE
D: Yes, Mr. Holmes. I'm all ready.
C: MYCROFT
D: If there's one thing I like about the Prussians, it's their punctuality.
C: GABRIELLE
D: If there's one thing I dislike about the British, it's their climate. I understand your jails are quite damp -- and your heating facilities totally inadequate.
C: MYCROFT
D: They are. But you're not going to jail. You're going back to Germany.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Germany?
C: MYCROFT
D: You will be conducted to the Swiss-German border, and be exchanged for one of our agents -- a man named Ibbetson.
C: GABRIELLE
D: Thank you.
C: MYCROFT
D: Don't thank me. Thank my brother. It was his idea.
N: Gabrielle looks at Holmes, but he avoids her eyes.
C: MYCROFT
D: Frankly, I think we are making a very poor deal. You much better than most operatives working for British intelligence. Don't you agree, Sherlock?
E: to Gabrielle turning to Holmes
C: HOLMES
D: And better than some consulting detectives.
E: with a small but gallant bow to Gabrielle
N: Mycroft signals to his aide, who comes in from the corridor and picks up Gabrielle's bag.
C: MYCROFT
D: Shall we?
E: to Gabrielle
C: GABRIELLE
D: I'll take that. Gentlemen.
E: reaching for parasol to Holmes and Watson
N: She turns and walks out the door, Mycroft following. Watson's bewilderment has now reached monumental proportions.
C: WATSON
D: All right, Holmes -- you don't have to explain anything to me, if you don't want to.
E: folding his arms
C: HOLMES
D: I appreciate that, Watson.
C: WATSON
D: After all, I'm only your official biographer --
C: HOLMES
D: Anyway, I don't think she'd care to have this story spread all over Strand Magazine.
C: WATSON
D: The public has a right to know these things. If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her feelings?
N: Holmes crosses to a small window overlooking the courtyard of the hotel, opens it, looks out.
S: EXT. HOTEL - DAY
N: Mycroft's aide comes out of the hotel with Gabrielle's suitcase, loads it into an open carriage waiting in front of the entrance. Gabrielle emerges, carrying her parasol, and accompanied by Mycroft. He helps her into the carriage, gets in beside her. The aide joins the coachman, and the carriage drives off. Gabrielle does not look back toward the hotel.
S: EXT. SMALL WINDOW - HOTEL - DAY
N: Holmes is framed in the open window, watching the carriage. Watson comes up behind him.
C: WATSON
D: If I promised not to write a word about it, would you enlighten me? As your friend -- as your valet --
C: HOLMES
D: Quiet. I'm trying to read a personal message.
C: WATSON
D: A message?
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: The carriage is moving away from the hotel. Gabrielle has her parasol over her shoulder, and it opens and closes, opens and closes. GABRIELLE - IN MOVING CARRIAGE - DAY She continues to signal with the parasol, unnoticed by Mycroft.
S: EXT. SMALL WINDOW - HOTEL - DAY
N: Watson is straining forward to see out the window.
C: WATSON
D: What is she saying?
C: HOLMES
D: Auf Wiedersehn.
E: slowly
C: WATSON
D: Auf Weider---? The nerve!
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: The carriage disappears down an avenue of trees, Gabrielle's parasol still flashing its message.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY
N: There is snow on the ground, and drifts of it piled up along the curbs. Traffic is light. Householders are shovelling the snow off the sidewalks, and pedestrians are hurrying along bundled up against the cold.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY
N: Holmes, in his dressing gown, and Watson, in his smoking jacket, are at the breakfast table. There is snow on the window-sills, and a cozy fire is burning in the grate. Watson is reading the morning paper. Holmes is sorting through his mail.
C: HOLMES
D: H'mmm. A letter from the Diogenes Club.
E: holding up envelope
C: WATSON
D: Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for membership.
C: HOLMES
D: If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother.
N: He has slit open the envelope. Watson watches him curiously as he reads the letter, but Holmes' face remains expressionless. Slowly he puts down the letter, rises, crosses to the window, stands there staring out into the wintry street.
C: WATSON
D: Aren't you going to finish your breakfast?
N: Holmes doesn't answer. Watson takes a lump of sugar out of the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his coffee. Then glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn't watching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs. It is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads: 9th December, 1888 Dear Sherlock, My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the Japanese counter-intelligence service for spying on naval installations in Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial, she was summarily executed by a firing squad. It might interest you to know that The page ends at this point. Watson turns the sheet of paper over with the tongs. The letter continues on the other side. she had been living in Japan these past few months under the name of Mrs. Ashdown. Sincerely, Mycroft Watson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing with his back to the room, gets up from the table.
C: WATSON
D: Holmes -- I'm terribly sorry about this.
C: HOLMES
D: Where is it, Watson?
E: quietly, without turning
C: WATSON
D: In the files. May to July, 1885.
E: after a beat
N: Holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk. From a row of similar volumes, he slides out the three files marked MAY, JUNE, and JULY 1885. Actually, it's the medical bag, standing on end, with the spines of three volumes pasted on the bottom.
C: HOLMES
D: You're getting better.
N: He sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out a bottle of cocaine. Watson watches him with compassion as he crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in, shuts the door. Footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a moment there is a knock on the door. Watson approaches the door, opens it to reveal INSPECTOR LESTRADE -- a short, nervous man whose features are sharper than his mind. He is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in his hands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown.
C: LESTRADE
D: Good morning, Watson. Just happened to be in the neighborhood, and I thought --
E: stepping in
C: WATSON
D: What is it this time, Inspector Lestrade?
C: LESTRADE
D: We've had three rather nasty murders in Whitechapel. All ladies of easy virtue. You may read something about it -- the newspapers are referring to the killer as Jack the Ripper.
C: WATSON
D: Yes, I think I have.
C: LESTRADE
D: Some of us at Scotland Yard were wondering if perhaps Mr. Holmes would be willing to --
C: WATSON
D: I'm sorry, Lestrade. But at the moment, Holmes is working on another problem.
E: a glance toward the bedroom
C: LESTRADE
D: Oh... Well, I just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him. I dare say we can solve it without his help.
E: trying to hide his disappointment
C: WATSON
D: Oh, I'm sure you will.
N: From Holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune being played on the violin. Watson starts to ease Lestrade out of the door.
C: WATSON
D: Good day, Lestrade.
N: He shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the violin for a moment. Then he crosses to the wicker chair, seats himself. He takes some sheets of paper out of the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his pen in the inkwell, starts to write. The violin music continues OVER SCENE, infinitely romantic, infinitely sad.
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
