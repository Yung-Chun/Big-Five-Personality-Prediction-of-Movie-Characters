S: 1 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
N: The following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE. A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It was a big game. Some kind of championship. ONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and hugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT LOST. They're very sad -- several are crying. One girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat- stained, tired and just blubbering. Stuff's coming out of her eyes, her nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all. The COACH, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in particular.
C: COACH
D: You quit! You gave up!
N: He KICKS a CHAIR. Now Amy is really a mess. She's crying, coughing, shaking.
C: COACH
D: You quit!!
E: CONT'D right in Amy's face
N: The Coach storms off.
C: COACH
D: Qutters! ... Quitters!
E: CONT'D
N: Amy is wailing and choking on her own tears. This IMAGE FREEZES.
C: TERRY
D: And that would be it. I don't think you need any narration at all. Just end it right there.
E: V.O.
N: REVEAL
S: 2 INT. OFFICE - DAY
N: BEGIN CREDITS We're in New York City. We're in the conference room of a modestly successful cable TV station called "Real TV." The people are young, energetic, clever. It's crowded, noisy -the furniture is beaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards all over them. This room is not for show -- work gets done here. SEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE are present. One of them is CYNTHIA REED. She's the boss.
C: TERRY
D: What do you think?
E: to Cynthia
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's horrible, it's depressing, I love it. What else?
C: ALICE
D: I want to re-pitch that pregnancy idea. Find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births.
C: KEITH
D: Yeah, when all that stuff comes out.
E: negative
N: Mixed reactions, mostly negative.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I have an idea.
N: IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
C: CYNTHIA
D: This is something I've been thinking about for a long time. We're "Real TV" right? I mean that's the name of the station.
E: CONT'D
N: AGREEMENT
C: CYNTHIA
D: So let's go real. We find someone. Just a regular person, someone. And we put their life on television - live... all day long.
E: CONT'D
N: Silence. No movement at all.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Calm down.
E: CONT'D
C: KEITH
D: What do you mean, like PBS did in the seventies? What was that family?
C: GREG
D: The Louds.
C: KEITH
D: Yeah.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No. We go way beyond that. We don't film it and edit it and put it on later. We go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. In between, we're on live all day, every day - the same person, -- for let's say a month.
E: shrugs
N: No one is wild for this. Some hate it -- some are unconvinced.
C: FELICIA
D: That's not a show that's a surveillance camera.
C: GREG
D: You can't do that.
C: CYNTHIA
D: The hell we can't. Look, the beauty of being a cable channel is we can take chances. I've thought about this and I'm telling you, I think this can make a noise. A loud one. There are twelve thousand channels. You've got to do something that says "Look at me!" Hell, people look at fish tanks all day. This is people! Someone's real life -- an TV, all day long - live... And, you know what? I'm doing it.
E: more firmly
N: Pause. The others know the argument is over.
C: GREG
D: In that case, we love it.
N: END CREDITS
S: 3 EXT. POOL HALL - DAY
N: A BUS passes. On the bus is an ad. It says, "Would you like to star in your own TV show? Call Real TV (and a phone number) Coming (and a date)."
S: 4 INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT - PARAMUS NEW JERSEY
N: This is a nice upscale pool hall. A party is in progress in a special private area -- a room upstairs let's say -- a loft. Thirty or forty PEOPLE in their twenties and thirties are informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends. It's NOISY, it's fun, it's informal. It's not a high-end group. By that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or stockbrokers. They're mostly blue-collar. Community college graduates. WE OPEN ON ED PEKURNY. He's an attractive man, about thirty. There's still something a little juvenile about him -- not stupid, just boyish. SOMEONE is VIDEOTAPING HIM for one of those congratulation montage things that are done at parties these days. Ed is good at this. He's not professional but he's a loosey-goosey guy who's kind of good on camera.
C: ED
D: I want to congratulate Kevin and Tracy on their engagement. I knew you guys were meant for each other from the moment Tracy told us she was pregnant.
C: TRACY
D: You asshole!
N: Everyone else is cracking up.
C: ED
D: What? What did I say?
E: innocently
C: TRACY
D: My mother's going to see this!
S: 5 INT. PARTY - LATER
N: Other people are being "interviewed" on tape. Ed is SHOOTING POOL with his buddy, JOHN. John's had a couple of drinks. He's a little melancholy. He is looking across the room, thoughtfully.
C: ED
D: What?
C: JOHN
D: Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
C: ED
D: You said that.
C: JOHN
D: We're falling behind.
N: Ed waves dismissively.
C: JOHN
D: You know who we are?
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: Tell me.
C: JOHN
D: We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
C: ED
D: I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
C: JOHN
D: I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
C: ED
D: So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
C: JOHN
D: Your brother's here.
N: ANGLE ON THE DOOR Ed's brother RAY and Ray's girlfriend SHARI arrive at the party. Shari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way. They both wave and then Shari goes off to talk to some of the LADIES and Ray joins Ed and John.
C: RAY
D: What's up?
C: ED
D: Where were you?
C: RAY
D: I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
E: reluctantly
C: JOHN/ED
D: Oooh!
E: taunting
C: RAY
D: I'm telling you, it's closing in on me. All of a sudden it's like a thing, it's a whole thing.
C: ED
D: What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
C: RAY
D: I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
N: They LAUGH.
S: 6 INT. PARTY - LATER
N: It's getting wild. Some of the girls are dancing raucously. ANGLE ON A TABLE (NOT A POOL TABLE, AN EATING-TABLE) Ed, Ray, John, Shari and maybe another WOMAN. Ray is holding a big tray of SHRIMP BALLS. During the conversation, Ray throws them in the air and catches them in his mouth like popcorn. Once, he even bounces one off the wall into his mouth.
C: ED
D: You know, those are for everybody.
N: Ray waves dismissively, then gets an idea.
C: RAY
D: Oh! Show them that thing you can do. This is great. I just found out she can do this, her brother told me. Come on.
E: to Shari to the others to Shari
C: SHARI
D: I don't -
E: thinks it's stupid
C: RAY
D: Come on...
N: She hesitates, but she really doesn't mind. Slightly, amused she takes her FIST and fits it completely INTO her MOUTH.
C: ED
D: Whoa!! Oh!
N: Ray is cracking up.
C: RAY
D: Is that unbelievable?
N: She removes her hand.
C: SHARI
D: And that concludes today's show. This is where you go around and collect the money.
E: to Ray
N: Ed LAUGHS. Ray gives her a KISS. Shari's roommate RITA sits down.
C: RITA
D: Hi.
C: SHARI
D: You guys know my roommate, Rita.
N: They do, vaguely.
C: ED
D: What's going on over there?
C: RITA
D: Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
C: ED
D: Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
E: not sure
C: RAY
D: You know, that would be like a great thing.
C: ED
D: What?
C: RAY
D: That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
C: ED
D: What are you drunk?
C: RAY
D: Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
C: ED
D: What is?!
C: RAY
D: Show business.
C: ED
D: You're in show business?
C: RAY
D: Yeah. I service video equipment.
C: ED
D: That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
C: RAY
D: I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
E: insulted
C: ED
D: Thumbsucker!
C: RAY
D: I'm making a tape.
C: ED
D: We're excited.
S: 7 INT. BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Ed and Shari, waiting for drink orders.
C: ED
D: So Ray met the family.
C: SHARI
D: Yeah...
C: ED
D: I hear the dog really liked him.
C: SHARI
D: Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
C: ED
D: Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
N: She takes Ed's beer.
C: SHARI
D: You shouldn't drink.
N: They LAUGH.
S: 8 INT. TABLE - A LITTLE LATER
N: Ed and Shari ARM-WRESTLING. After a struggle, Ed wins. Ed is impressed.
C: ED
D: Jesus!
N: Shari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer.
C: SHARI
D: And, you know, every guy I ever broke up with, the minute it was over, I could tell you what went wrong, how it went wrong, why it had to go wrong... but when I'm in it... lost. I'm like a love coroner. Bring me the corpse, I'11 tell you what killed it. But how to prevent it? Lost.
E: continuing a previous conversation
N: Ed LAUGHS.
C: ED
D: Ray's on.
N: They walk over. ANGLE ON RAY
C: RAY
D: Hi. I'm Ray Pekurney. I'm from Paramus, New Jersey...
E: to camera
S: 9 INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE - DAY
N: She's watching Ray's tape. Ray thinks he's funnier and
T: cuter than he is.
C: RAY
D: All my friends tell me "Ray, you've got too much personality for one guy." It's like at a party -- I'm at the center of the attention. Everybody loves me.
E: ON TAPE
N: He gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre.
C: RAY
D: Ha, ha, ha. I'll kick your ass. No really, let me show you my girlfriend. She's really cute.
E: CONT'D
N: He reaches out and grabs Shari's wrist. Shari is struggling to stay out of frame. We just see her arm and Ray pulling on it. Ray lets go.
C: RAY
D: She's strong, 'cause she's a Fedex girl. She lifts those packages. But she's not dikey at all, she's really pretty.
E: CONT'D
N: CYNTHIA FAST-FORWARDS WE SEE the camera shooting an empty space. Then Ed's head appears sideways right in front of the CAMERA.
C: ED
D: Hello I'm Ed.
N: He starts to sniff.
C: ED
D: What smells?
E: CONT'D
N: He steps back from the camera and straightens his head as he SNIFFS. He's more relaxed than Ray.
C: ED
D: What is that smell? Oop, I think it's this idea. One person on TV all day long? Are you nuts?
E: CONT'D screams
N: WE HEAR LAUGHS The Real TV Staff are enjoying Ed's tape while they eat lunch out of styrofoam containers.
C: ED
D: Seriously, get your resumes in order. When my brother Ray - whose personality you were just dazzled by -- told me he was going to try out for this -- I said, "why in the world would anyone want to be on TV all day long, no privacy, everybody knowing your business, exposing every single detail of your life I mean... why would anyone want to do that? But then I thought of a reason... Why the hell not?
E: CONT'D loudly
N: He KISSES the LENS, smudging it. Cynthia, watching, cracks up. The others seem to like him to.
S: 10 INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY
N: This is a video store in Paramus, New Jersey. It's busy. PEOPLE are in line to check out tapes. WE OPEN ON a WOMAN -- a mother -- who is rummaging through her purse for her Blockbuster card. She looks up and sees that her TWO CHILDREN have opened several boxes of candy from the candy display and are eating from the boxes.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh for -- Put those -- Oh God...
N: She grabs the boxes from them. The boxes are ripped more than she thought and candy goes flying all over. She bends to pick it up. Ed appears. He works here.
C: ED
D: We'11 take care of it.
E: to the Mom
N: Someone arrives with a broom.
C: ED
D: Here. This time throw it out, don't eat it.
E: CONT'D to the broom guy
N: LOU, the Manager passes.
C: ED
D: Lou, can I talk to you a second?
N: Lou seems like he'd prefer to avoid this.
C: LOU
D: Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
C: ED
D: What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
C: LOU
D: Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
C: ED
D: Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
C: LOU
D: I batted!
C: ED
D: You batted or you bunted?
C: LOU
D: Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
C: ED
D: Well, then I'm quitting.
C: LOU
D: Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
C: ED
D: Who's in it?
E: wise-ass
C: CLERK
D: Ed, telephone.
N: Ed goes to the phone.
C: ED
D: Yeah... Are you serious? ... Come on, no kidding, who is this? ... Holy shit!
E: into the phone
S: 11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
N: Ed is being interviewed by the "Real TV" staff whom we met earlier. He's slightly less comfortable than on his tape, but he's good.
C: ED
D: I had one year of college. And then one year of junior college.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What did you study?
E: O.C.
C: ED
D: Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
N: They LAUGH.
T: CUT TO:
S: 11A INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: Well, there's Ray, my brother. He's... ambitious. Like a few years ago, he started this mobile dog-grooming business. But, like, out of his Camry. He had this bathtub in his trunk - he's throwing the dogs in there, they're fighting and splashing, then he'd slam the trunk down, let 'em run around inside screaming getting all wet... then he'd use the car exhaust to dry'em. Ah, Ray... he just can't get a break.
E: Ed starts cracking up wiping his eyes
T: CUT TO:
S: 11B INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: My sister -- Marcia, I mean she can't get a break. About seven years ago she falls in love with this Vietnamese guy who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country. So they get married, they have a kid, he gets his citizenship, immediately divorces my sister and marries this Vietnamese woman who, he was probably already married to all along. She can pick 'em. She's got a nice little boy, though. My nephew, Andy.
E: pause
T: CUT TO:
S: 11C INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: My Mom's okay. Kinda. I knew a guy who hated his mother - Stuey Shwam. He hated his mother so much, he had his belly button removed.
T: CUT TO:
S: 11D INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: No, I've never been married.
N: The interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate. He doesn't. He shrugs -- that's it.
T: CUT TO:
S: 11E INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: Oh, my father -what an asshole. When I was twelve, my mother needed a hysterectomy -- my father ran off with her nurse! And that's the last I heard of him.
T: CUT TO:
S: 11F INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: Al, my stepfather he's opinionated. And you have to listen because he's like in a wheelchair.
T: CUT TO:
S: 11G INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: I like my job -- I mean I'm doing all right. I'm not sure how long I want to stay there, you know... I mean, I'm thirty-one... I'm not sure I want to be a video store clerk when I'm forty... Of course, I didn't expect to be doing it 'til I was thirty-one, either. But... you know I'm... keeping my options open. Anything comes along, I'm ready to pounce.
E: growls like a cougar
T: CUT TO:
S: 11H INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
C: ED
D: A dream? Of course I have a dream I just don't know what the hell it is.
E: shrugs and smiles
N: Ed's image freezes, while he has a funny-cute expression on his face. PULL BACK TO REVEAL a TV in a conference room with Ed's frozen image on it. Cynthia is there with her bosses, the people who run the network that owns Real TV. The top man is MR. SCHARLACH. His deputies are MS. SEAVER and MR. McILVAINE. This is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her staff. This is richer, more corporate and formal.
C: CYNTHIA
D: He's who we want to go with.
C: SCHARLACH
D: This guy.
E: doubtfully
C: CYNTHIA
D: I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
C: SCHARLACH
D: I'm not sure about the entire concept.
N: Cynthia is frustrated.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now. We're running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel. If people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. I mean if he's good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better.
N: McILVAINE How is that better?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Come on. People cannot turn away from an accident. You drive by, you say "Ooh, I hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family. So let's do it.
N: She stops, waiting for approval.
S: 12 INT. VIDEO STORE
C: SCHARLACH
D: Good luck.
E: coldly
N: Ed's RE-STOCKING the SHELVES He gets goosed from behind
C: RAY
D: Hey...
E: O.C. very loud and happy
C: ED
D: Oh!
E: goosed
N: Ed DROPS the BOXES. Ray is there with Shari.
C: RAY
D: I got your message. Way to go!
C: ED
D: Hi, Shari. Let's go in the stockroom.
E: to Ray
S: 13 INT. STOCKROOM
N: Ed and Ray enter.
C: RAY
D: So when do you start?
C: ED
D: I ... I'm not gonna do it.
C: RAY
D: What?
C: ED
D: Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
C: RAY
D: Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
E: disgusted
N: He slaps a tape off a shelf.
C: ED
D: You would do this? You would actually --
C: RAY
D: In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
C: ED
D: Why do you do that?
C: RAY
D: What?
C: ED
D: Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
C: RAY
D: All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
E: impatiently
C: ED
D: I'm doing all right.
C: RAY
D: Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
N: Shari enters, curious about the yelling. She stands there quietly, unnoticed by the guys.
C: RAY
D: You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: Screw off.
C: RAY
D: How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
C: ED
D: I don't know.
C: RAY
D: That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
C: ED
D: Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
C: RAY
D: Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot. Hi.
E: sees Shari
N: Ed turns and sees Shari. She's self-conscious. She feels like she's been caught eavesdropping.
C: SHARI
D: Oh. I -- I heard Ray yelling. 1 didn't mean to --
C: RAY
D: Give me a chance. I'm begging you. I need a break. Look, I'11 cover your ass. I'11 ride shotgun. Just bring those cameras over to me and I'11 make something happen for both of us. I swear. Come on, Eddie
E: to Ed
N: Pause.
C: ED
D: All right.
C: RAY
D: Yeah?!
C: ED
D: Yeah.
N: Ray lifts Ed up. Ray kisses Ed.
C: RAY
D: Is this guy a brother?!
E: to Shari
S: 14 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Moderate-priced, restaurant. WE OPEN ON a CLOSE-UP of AL. He's about seventy. REVEAL THE FAMILY
C: AL
D: What happens when you go to the bathroom? Do they go in with you?
N: Ed, Ray, Al, JEANETTE and MARCIA. Al is in a WHEELCHAIR and has an oxygen mask connected to a tank. He periodically takes a hit of oxygen. He's a little short of breath, but loves to talk. Jeanette is Ed's mother -- about sixty. Marcia is a little older than Ed.
C: ED
D: No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
C: AL
D: What if--you're vomiting?
C: ED
D: What if I'm vomiting?
E: amazed by the question
C: AL
D: Do they show it?
C: ED
D: I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
C: RAY
D: Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
C: MARCIA
D: What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
E: accusing, to Ed
C: ED
D: No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
C: MARCIA
D: They're gonna mock our foibles.
E: angrily
C: ED
D: Our what?
C: MARCIA
D: Our foibles, our foibles!
C: RAY
D: We don't have foibles.
C: MARCIA
D: Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
C: JEANTTE
D: Eddie, please don't let them mock our foibles.
C: ED
D: Stop saying foibles!
E: losing it
C: MARCIA
D: Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
C: RAY
D: That's the point -- this could change things.
C: MARCIA
D: How?
C: RAY
D: For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
C: MARCIA
D: What does that have to do with... ?
E: points to Ed
C: RAY
D: If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
N: Ed nods. Pause.
C: RAY
D: I borrow against that now, at the bank. Buy the business. And Ed becomes a silent partner. Now here's the beauty part. While we're on TV I plug the shit out of the business. Free advertising.
E: CONT'D
C: AL
D: How about sex?
N: A STUNNED pause. They all look at Al.
C: ED
D: I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
C: AL
D: No! Do they show you having sex?
C: ED
D: No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
C: AL
D: At what point?
C: ED
D: At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
N: WE HEAR: A loud drilling sound.
T: CUT TO:
S: 15 INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: A WORKMAN is drilling a hole in the wall. Ed is there with a TV CREW. They're running cable and drilling holes and examining the apartment. Cynthia is going around supervising. Ray and Shari are there. Ray is fascinated. Ed is tense. Shari is observant. Ray separates from Ed and Shari and asks one of the Installers a technical question. SHARI AND ED Ed thinks. Ed joins Cynthia.
C: SHARI
D: Are you sure about this?
C: ED
D: Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
C: SHARI
D: Why do it?
C: ED
D: I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
C: SHARI
D: Cream rinse?
C: ED
D: Dynamite.
E: laughs
C: SHARI
D: So?
C: ED
D: So maybe this is my dynamite.
C: SHARI
D: Dynamite is dangerous.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ed, can I see you a second.
C: ED
D: Excuse me.

C: CYNTHIA
D: I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.

C: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
D: Tomorrow morning, the cable channel known as Real TV, begins broadcasting one of the most heavily promoted concepts in the history of cable television. In an experiment that they say will last at least a month. They're going to follow -- live - every waking minute of a thirty-one year old video store clerk from Paramus New Jersey. The Real TV press release on this promises that none of it will be scripted, none of it will be edited and in my opinion, none of it will be interesting. we're all just supposed to sit in front of our TV's and watch this guy... live.

N: On the TV, the commercial ends and the Real TV logo appears. A CRAWL BEGINS It says "The following is unedited, unscripted, and unrehearsed. It is the real life of one American citizen named Ed Pekurny." The logo fades away and we see Ed, in bed, sleeping. His ALARM RINGS and he wakes up. He's groggy from sleep. Instinctively, he begins SCRATCHING his balls. As he does, it hits him that this is not a normal morning. He looks up and sees two steady-cam guys at the foot of his bed, aiming their cameras at him. Ed, then, looks at his hand on his balls. Gently, he moves his hand away.

S: 25 INT. KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Ed enters, dressed and showered. The Steady-cam is in his face. Ed is tight. He's much less comfortable than he expected to be. He smiles stiffly at the camera. He's misplaced his natural charm. He gets a box of Pop-tarts out of the freezer. As he does, other stuff falls out of the freezer on to the floor. He's embarrassed. He bends down to pick things up, showing his ass to the camera.

S: 37 EXT. STREET - MONTAGE
N: Ed is doing his morning errands. A little shopping -- a little banking -- always ON CAMERA. At one point, he WALKS INTO a GLASS DOOR with the word "Pull" on it. He pushed, banging his forehead. A CHILD points to the word "Pull." Ed turns to the camera, embarrassed. Later he buys a slice of pizza at a little place that's doing no business.
C: ED
D: Best pizza in New Jersey.
E: to the camera
N: As he walks down the street, PEOPLE call out "Hey Ed!" People in windows show him that they're watching him at that exact moment. The camera shoots some of the people in the windows. They see themselves on TV and they go wild. Ed also is confronted by GUYS grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things like "Hey, Ed, holding your own?" or "Hey, Ed, howls the grand ballroom." Ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles it with good grace. He seems to be loosening up.
S: 38 INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY
N: Ed arrives at work. The store is already open. (Ed usually gets there in the afternoon and stays until closing.) CUSTOMERS are a little stunned by the arrival of a camera. Some know what it's about some don't. The CLERKS are aware of what's going on. They all signed releases. Ed's BOSS greets him stiffly. Clearly he's trying to get face-time on camera.

N: He shakes Ed's hand and smiles at the camera. He WAVES a little. The BROOM GUY crosses, staring transfixed at the camera. He blocks Ed and Lou. He FREEZES, then panics.

RAPID CUTS of VARIOUS PEOPLE around America, watching -- A couple, a young guy, a woman alone -- ending with a few college-age girls in what appears to be a dorm room. ONE GIRL is watching intently.

C: MODERATOR
D: Let's change topics for a moment. Does anybody have a viewpoint on something going on now called "Ed TV".
N: PANEL MEMBER #1 This, I believe, is a new low point in American culture. PANEL MEMBER #2 I agree. What it reveals is the absolute creative bankruptcy in the television business. What they're saying, basically, is "We're giving up. We have no ideas." PANEL MEMBER #3 It's worse than that! They don't select someone with any talent, or with something to say -- they seem to celebrate the fact that this guy is a boob. It's a joyous celebration of boobery. PANEL MEMBER #4 I think we've already spent far too much time discussing this. They all agree.

S: 110 INT. CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
C: ED
D: This used to be a regular thing. And the worst part, is while she'd be waiting for me to come down to some bar and get her, she'd start up with some guy and say "Wait 'til my brother gets here, he'11 kick your ass." So then I walk in and there's some rhinoceros in a windbreaker who tries to shove me into a shot glass. And Marcia's drunk and screaming "Kick his ass, Ed. Kick his ass." I think this is it.
E: looks out
S: 111 INT. BAR

C: MARCIA
D: Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
C: ED

C: MARCIA
D: For God sakes, you said two words about some lousy pizza joint, the guy's a millionaire now. This could be my whole future we're talking about. Hi, I'm Ed's sister.

PANEL MEMBER #1 But he's not a normal person anymore. He's a celebrity. We're no longer observing anyone's "real life." PANEL MEMBER #2 (disagreeing) But that's what's interesting! The effect of celebrity on an otherwise average person. PANEL MEMBER #3 But do you really feel that Ed is an average person?

D: Jeanette, you're hurting me.
C: ED
D: I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
E: on the defensive
N: Al breathes loudly.
C: ED
D: If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives -- or when I thought you came into our lives --
E: CONT'D uncomfortably pointedly to his mother
C: JEANETTE
D: And what did he come back now for?
C: ED

The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says.

C: SCHARLACH

D: Cynthia...
N: He wants it accomplished.
S: 139 EXT. STREET - DAY

C: RITA
D: Oh. Ed.
E: nervously

C: ED
D: Well, when will she be back?
C: RITA
D: She won't.
C: ED
D: What are you talking about?
C: RITA
D: She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
C: ED

C: ED
D: What if Shari's the dream?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ed, do you want my advice?
C: ED
D: Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
C: CYNTHIA
D: Leave her be.
C: ED
D: You said a woman likes to be pursued.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.

Here, as in the other times we see her, Jill is comfortable with the situation. She's the opposite of Shari. She poses willingly. She chats easily with paparazzi. She clings to Ed. There's nothing overt or obnoxious about her. She's just comfortable and good at it and always looks great. 2. INTERVIEW with the guys who didn't like Shari. GUY #1 Way to go, Ed! GUY # 2 Now, we're talking! 3. A N.Y. Post story: "Readers Pick Jill over Shari." Pictures of both women. Jill looks great. Shari is in her uniform and looks like a mouse. 4. SHARI In a new apartment. Watching Ed and Jill on TV. She's very unhappy. She turns it off. 5. Ed and Jill at the nice restaurant he was at with Shari earlier.

D: Ohhh...
E: in pain
C: JILL
D: Ed?
C: ED
D: Ohh... do you own a cat?
C: JILL

N: He looks at her apologetically.
S: 161 EXT. JILL'S BUILDING
N: Ed is being loaded into an AMBULANCE. He looks humiliated. PEOPLE in the street are applauding politely as if Ed were an injured ballplayer being carried off the field. Jill is by the ambulance.

C: SCHARLACH
D: What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
N: He thinks.
C: SCHARLACH
D: With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
C: CYNTHIA
D: Good luck.
E: coldly
S: 164 EXT. STREET - DAY

C: ED
D: She did not! You know what she did?
E: venting
C: ED

D: Hey Ed! ... She was a little too much for you, huh? Must run in the family.

E: angry yells to the camera

C: ED
D: Oh my -- He wrote a book?! Ray wrote a book?! He never read a book!
S: 165 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: "DAY 58" It's the hallway of a cheap hotel. Ed and the camera come off the elevator. Ed looks at room numbers. He can HEAR the noise from all the rooms. A radio -- a domestic disturbance -- a baby crying -- it's a horror. He KNOCKS ON a door.
C: HANK
D: Who is it?
E: O.C.
C: ED
D: It's Ed.
N: The door opens REVEALING Ed's father.
C: HANK

E: CONT'D
N: Ed SHRUGS.
C: HANK
D: They don't get cable here, so 1 can't watch you.
E: CONT'D
N: Ed just GRUNTS. Hank takes LAUNDRY off a chair.
C: HANK
D: Sit down.
E: CONT'D
N: He does. He looks around.
C: HANK
D: Quite a shithole, isn't it?
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
C: HANK
D: I was in jail.
C: ED
D: The whole time? Eighteen years?
C: HANK
D: No. Two times.
C: ED
D: What...
C: HANK
D: Check forging.
C: ED
D: Oh, man! So...
C: HANK
D: The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
C: ED
D: So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
C: HANK
D: I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
N: Ed doesn't know what to say. He's bitter towards Hank, but there's also some empathy.
C: ED
D: All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out. I gotta go.
E: to the camera quickly, to Hank
C: HANK
D: Ed... I'm sorry.
C: ED
D: Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
E: still bitter
C: HANK
D: What...
C: ED
D: The pirate ship.
N: Hank looks blankly at him.
C: ED
D: -- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
E: CONT'D
C: HANK
D: Do you still have it?
C: ED
D: No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
N: He exits. Out in the hallway, he leans back against the door, drained. The camera is right on him, soaking it up.
S: 167 INT. TV STUDIO
N: The same PBS-type panel of smart-looking people we met earlier. WE OPEN ON about half the panel.
C: MODERATOR
D: Let's hear from our guest panelist. You've expressed some interesting thoughts on this, subject. What do you see as the meaning, if there is any, of Ed TV, John.
N: REVEAL JOHN, sitting comfortably on the panel, looking very wise.
C: JOHN
D: I feel that Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome. It used to be that someone became famous because they were special. Now people are considered special just for being famous. Fame, itself, is now a moral good in this country. It's its own virtue.
N: The others NOD appreciatively as John puts a PIPE in his mouth. TV INTERVIEWS
C: OLD GUY
D: I was Ed's Little League coach. He had no coordination. The big game, he struck cut with the bases loaded. Then he cried like a woman. It was sickening.
T: CUT TO:
C: OLD WOMAN
D: I was his third grade teacher. I said "Take him for tests. There's something wrong with him." They didn't listen.
T: CUT TO:
C: ANOTHER GUY
D: He used to steal things from my store. At least I think it was him. Yeah, it was probably him.
S: 168 EXT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: A MAN, on the sidewalk, has a STUFFED CAT stuck to his back to tease Ed.
C: CAT MAN
D: Hey, look, I just fell off a table!
N: Suddenly, a TUBFUL OF WATER crashes down on him.
S: 169 INT. ED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ed at the window, with a now empty plastic tub.
C: ED
D: Okay, is that funny?
E: yelling down
N: Then he throws the tub out the window.
C: ED
D: How was that? Was that funny?!
E: CONT'D to the camera
S: 170 INT. NETWORK OFFICE
N: "DAY 78" Again, everyone there, including Cynthia. A Honcho is reading a report. HONCHO #1 Of more concern than the sag in Ed's ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now. The positives are down and the negatives are up. There's a feeling that Ed isn't cool anymore. We're starting to see a big L.F.
C: GREG
D: Hm?
N: HONCHO #1 L.F. Loser Factor. HONCHO #2 That's deadly. McILVAINE Not necessarily. I mean instead of running from the L.F., run with it. Create more moments like the table thing. We can package a video "Ed's Goofiest Moments." Let him be America's Goofball.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
C: SCHARLACH
D: Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
S: 171 INT. BAR - NIGHT
N: "DAY 94" Tad and Barry -- as we met them, originally -- are watching TV. They're really enjoying it -- laughing, pounding the table.
C: TAD
D: I don't know, I still love this guy.
C: BARRY
D: Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
C: TAD
D: Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
C: BARRY
D: You know it.
N: REVEAL that they are watching Joma. On the TV -- Joma is eating dinner in his apartment with TWO attractive WOMEN, who, apparently, both live there. Joma is upset (but he's funny when he's upset). What's upsetting him is that across the alley, in a window of another building, he can plainly see an OVERWEIGHT MAN, with his shirt off, exercising. The overweight man is apparently watching an exercise video and is bouncing up and down in place causing everything to jiggle unpleasantly.
C: JOMA'S FRIEND
D: Ignore him.
C: JOMA
D: I can't! It's like a mudslide. Put on a shirt!
E: screams out the window
N: ANGLE ON TAD AND BARRY, HYSTERICAL ANGLE ON TV
C: JOMA
D: I support the fact that your exercising but, for the love of God, put on a shirt.
E: CONT'D yelling
C: JOMA'S FRIEND
D: Shut the curtains.
E: to Joma
C: JOMA
D: No! Let him shut the curtains.
N: TAD AND BARRY Laughing and wiping their eyes.
S: 172 INT. ED'S BEDROOM
N: Off the air. Ed ON the PHONE.
T: INTERCUT WITH CYNTHIA
C: ED
D: This Joma is so phoney! I mean, those things aren't really happening. I think they have writers making that stuff up for him. Hey, couldn't we do that? Hire some writers and have them write up some crazy situations I could get into?
N: She's listening, amazed.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
C: ED
D: Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
E: getting angry
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ed --
E: getting annoyed
C: ED
D: You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say - "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
E: mocking imitation
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ed --
C: ED
D: No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
N: She HANGS UP and has an acid reflux.
S: 173 INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT
N: Ed and John are playing.
C: JOHN
D: Look, you put anybody on TV sixteen hours a day, at some point they're going to wind up rolling off a table on to a cat. I mean with no privacy, there's no... dignity.
N: Ed thinks. Pause.
C: ED
D: You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
C: JOHN
D: When? Today?
C: ED
D: No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby... Jessica!
E: tries to remember
C: JOHN
D: Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
C: ED
D: Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
C: JOHN
D: Right, right...
C: ED
D: And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
C: JOHN
D: Right.
E: cheerfully
C: ED
D: So he killed himself.
C: JOHN
D: Oh.
E: a little shaken
N: SILENCE. The cell phone RINGS. Ed PICKS UP the phone.

S: 175 INT. HOSPITAL - AN HOUR LATER

E: to Ray pretends to cry
C: RAY
D: You know what your problem is?
C: ED
D: Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
C: RAY
D: I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
C: ED
D: Me?! That's you!
C: RAY
D: I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.

C: ED
D: Moe!

C: ED
D: Three more months?
C: MR. SCHARLACH
D: Absolutely! Ed TV is more popular than ever. Congratulations.
N: McILVAINE Only, Ed, we want you, in the next few weeks to spend a lot more time with your family.
C: ED
D: You do?
C: SEAVER
D: Definitely. Cynthia, explain it to him.
N: Cynthia just stares at her, COLDLY.
C: SEAVER
D: I'11 do it. People want to see what happens to them now. Do your mother and step-father get back together? How does your sister handle being alone? Your feud with your brother.
E: CONT'D to Ed
C: SCHARLACH
D: In fact, we have a new concept. Since your family signed releases, we can follow them on camera even when you're not with them. We can cut around from family member to family member. Whoever's the most exciting at that moment.
N: McILVAINE And, of course, it's another big bonus payment for you. Pause.
C: ED
D: A couple of years ago my Uncle Roy got bit on the ass by a dog.
N: Silence. What the hell is he talking about?
C: ED
D: So he gave me his tickets to the U.S. Open -- the tennis matches.
E: CONT'D
N: They still have no idea what he's talking about.
C: ED
D: So me and Ray, we tell our friends "Watch when Andre Agassi is gonna serve for the first time. When he's bouncing the ball and it's real quiet, we'11 yell "Whoop". And you'11 all hear us."
E: CONT'D
N: Pause.
C: SCHARLACH
D: I see.
E: he doesn't
C: ED
D: You know what that is? It's sad. I mean it was just so we could be heard. So we could stand out from the crowd for a second. So we did it. But we had nothing to say. Just "Whoop". That's it. And the stupid part I mean the really stupid part is we thought it like... elevated us above the crowd. Where the fact is it made us stupider than the crowd.
C: SCHARLACH
D: I see.
C: ED
D: Stop saying "I see." You don't see. Cynthia, I owe you an apology.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't think so.
C: ED
D: Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
S: 188 INT. SHARI'S PLACE
N: Shari watching Ed TV.
S: 189 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
C: ED
D: Ray, you were right. It's like in school. I was always saying "the room was too hot, the teacher didn't like me" -- but it was me! Everything that's wrong with my life I did. Okay? So now this is it. My family has problems. Which are our fault. And TV is not the place to solve them. So I quit. I'm taking what very little dignity I've got left and I quit. Can someone validate my parking?
E: to the camera
N: Pause. SHOCK.
C: MR. SCHARLACH
D: Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
C: ED
D: All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
N: Scharlach speaks carefully - gently. He's aware of the camera. He doesn't want to come off as a villain.
C: SCHARLACH
D: No, I mean you can't quit.
N: Ed thinks.
C: ED
D: I can't?
C: MR. SCHARLACH
D: Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
E: very gently
C: ED
D: Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
C: MR. SCHARLACH
D: Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
C: ED
D: All right. Let them decide.
N: He turns right to the camera.
C: ED
D: I'd like you all to do me a favor. Turn me off. Just grab the remote and change the channel. I mean, basically, all you're watching now is a guy deteriorate. The only thing missing is the smell. You're better than that Turn me off. Thank you.

S: 193 INT. DINER - NIGHT
N: Ed is sitting alone, eating lunch. He's surrounded by cameras and shielded by BODYGUARDS. OUTSIDE the diner a CROWD of rubberneckers is out on the sidewalk, looking in at him, some of them acting up, some just staring in. Ed is tired. He glances out the window and makes a MONKEY FACE. Suddenly, he FREEZES. He sees Shari's face in the crowd. She puts her fist in her mouth.

N: Ed and Shari are walking -- on camera.

N: He laughs. Pause.
C: SHARI
D: You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
E: CONT'D
C: ED
D: What did you do to your hair?
C: SHARI
D: My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.

N: MUCH CONFUSION
C: ED
D: I just came up to pass out these Ed TV hats.
E: CONT'D
N: He takes a lot of HATS out of the carton and begins placing on the heads of the Honchos.
C: ED
D: A guy made these up for me. He spelled Ed with two D's. Okay, listen. The real reason I came up here -- and then I'11 get out of your way -- is I've been thinking about what you said. About let's start having more fun with this show, you know? Let's give it a big kick in the ass.
E: CONT'D
N: HONCHO #1 Well, we were thinking --
C: ED

N: The Honchos staring blankly.
C: ED
D: But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. Hah?
