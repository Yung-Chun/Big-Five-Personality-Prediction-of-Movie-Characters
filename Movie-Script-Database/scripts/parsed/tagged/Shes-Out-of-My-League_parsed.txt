M: SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE
M: Written by
M: Sean Anders & John Morris
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
N: A dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room. A slide projector dimly lights MR. FULLER, a crew-cutted Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group. The current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry figure - it could be any of about a billion people.
C: FULLER
D: ...So, let's keep a steely eye out for this bastard. Before we dismiss, this is your monthly reminder of why we're here.
E: THEN
N: Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag. Close on one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties. He politely pays close attention to the presentation.
C: FULLER
D: The American people want to travel. They want to attend baseball contests and popular music concerts.
E: CONT'D Slide: Family in front of a fake dinosaur Slide: Fat guys spilling beers as they go for a foul ball Slide: John Tesh
N: Close on another face in the group. A doughy man with three- day scruff and a trendily long haircut. He looks bored, rolling his eyes at the speech.
C: FULLER
D: They want to be happy. But, Security comes first. Without security there can be no happy. You are America's front line in the global war on terror. Let's hit the trenches and let's be careful out there.
E: CONT'D Slide: People line dancing Slide: Army soldier with a massive machine gun guards a play- ground Slide: TSA logo
N: The lights come up and as the group files out we get a better look at their uniforms. The TSA agents move out into the...
S: INT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY
N: The agents take their places, manning the screening equipment. We push in on the bald man as he takes up his post next to the walk-through metal detector. This is KIRK KETTNER. He is not a looker. His uniform only serves to highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and demeanor are pleasant and kind. The scruffy agent is STAINER. He stands at the x-ray monitor. As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer.
C: STAINER
D: Kirk, bro. Tonight?
N: INSERT: The flyer reads, "Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night!" Stainer is pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo.
C: KIRK
D: I don't know, Stainer.
C: STAINER
D: Dude, you never come see us anymore. It's been like four months. Time to forget about Marnie and get back on the whores.
N: Stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable. Fuller shoots a stern look from his office.
C: KIRK
D: It's not that. It's my Grandma. I'll probably be at the hospital for the next few nights.
C: STAINER
D: Oh, shit. I spaced that. How's she doing?
C: KIRK
D: She's hanging in there but it doesn't look good.
C: STAINER
D: Dude, I'm sorry. She's a great lady. That sucks.
N: A Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. Mr. Fuller appears behind Kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly motions to the Arab. Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist.
C: KIRK
D: Hey there, Habib.
C: HABIB
D: Howdy Kirk. Lemme guess; I been flagged for a random search.
E: perfect English with a southern accent
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, sorry. I'll get you out of here quick. You off to Boston again?
C: HABIB
D: No, sir. Pediatric convention in Delaware.
N: Kirk opens Habib's bag.
C: HABIB
D: Kirk, I know you're just doing your job but, for Pete's sake, ya'll know me.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: I'm sorry. It's just...
N: Kirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up.
C: KIRK
D: Okay, Habib, you're all set buddy. Have a good trip.
E: CONT'D
C: HABIB
D: Thanks Kirk. See you next time.
N: Fuller again appears behind Kirk.
C: HABIB
D: Praise be to Allah.
E: CONT'D to fuller - now in a thick Arab accent
C: FULLER
D: You think that's funny!? You wanna sit in first class or you wanna sit on my gloved and jellied finger!?
S: EXT. AIRPORT CURB - DAY
N: Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. Although we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see several men stare as she passes by on her way into...
S: INT. AIRPORT TICKETING
N: More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow the legs to the check-in line. The legs glide to the front and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent. From the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket agents. (One on each side of the legs.) One is black and one white; each are dealing with customers. They simultaneously notice our woman. They suspiciously eye one another and the race is on. Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next. Angle on the WHITE AGENT as he waits on a yuppie couple.
C: WHITE AGENT
D: Okay, how many bags are you checking? Any bags!?
E: RUSHED
C: YUPPIE MAN
D: Is this one too big to carry on?
C: WHITE AGENT
D: No. Carry it on. Good call.
C: YUPPIE WOMAN
D: Grant, you don't want to lug that thing all over the airport.
N: The agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh. He looks to his right to check the progress of the BLACK AGENT, who is waiting on an old Asian woman.
C: BLACK AGENT
D: Did you pack your bags yourself?
E: RUSHED
N: The Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the question but she smiles and nods along.
C: ASIAN WOMAN
D: Yes.
C: BLACK AGENT
D: Has anyone unknown to you asked you to carry anything onto your flight?
N: More smiles and blank nods.
C: ASIAN WOMAN
D: Yes.
C: BLACK AGENT
D: I think you mean NO.
C: WHITE AGENT
D: You can't do that!
C: BLACK AGENT
D: She doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about!
C: YUPPIE MAN
D: Where exactly is gate F5?
C: WHITE AGENT
D: Just past F4. Have a day now folks. Let's hustle it up.
C: ASIAN WOMAN
D: Sank you!
C: BLACK AGENT
D: No sweat. Keep it moving.
N: The Asian woman is not going anywhere. The black agent leans into her face and barks once like a dog. Her smile turns to fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie.
C: BOTH AGENTS
D: Next!
N: Reverse to show the woman they were competing for. She is a classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. Drop dead beautiful. She is startled by the sudden call from both men. She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent. He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co- worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.
C: MOLLY
D: Hi, I'm booked on flight 94 to Burbank. Molly McCall.
C: BLACK AGENT
D: California. Fantastic. So do you travel quite a bit?
E: trying way too hard
N: The white agent moves to loiter around the black agent's station, just to get a better look at MOLLY.
C: WHITE AGENT
D: Hey Derek. You got the numbers on the new, um, procedures for the, um, airport thing... regarding the, ah, planes? Whassup?
E: making it up as he goes to Molly
S: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
N: Kirk is at his post. Stainer works the next x-ray belt, where a young rocker type is running a guitar case through. Stainer stops the belt and moves it back to get a better look.
C: STAINER
D: Les Paul Classic re-issue?
C: ROCKER
D: No, it's a sixty-five. Mint.
E: SMUG
C: STAINER
D: Fuck you. No way.
N: The rocker boy looks at his watch as Stainer rolls the case through and pops it open.
C: ROCKER
D: Dude, I'm late for my flight.
C: STAINER
D: Sorry, I have to search this case for, you know, explosives and such. This thing is sweet!
N: Stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the bins and bags pile up before him. At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting or stammering - just friendly and relaxed.
C: KIRK
D: Morning.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, hello again.
C: KIRK
D: Second trip in two days?
N: Molly is putting her laptop back in her bag.
C: MOLLY
D: Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop to L.A. but they've got me going back and forth three days in a row. This client is killing me.
C: KIRK
D: Well hang in there kiddo and I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
C: MOLLY
D: It's a date.
N: Molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk.
C: FULLER
D: Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever like to...you know...put my penis in her vagina.
E: wink
N: Back at Stainer's station. As he puts the guitar back in its case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine. Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes.
C: ROCKER
D: What the hell!?
N: He grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch.
C: STAINER
D: Dude, I am so sorry.
C: ROCKER
D: Sorry my ass! This thing is worth more than you make in a year, you clumsy motherfucker!
C: STAINER
D: Yeah, I bet it was but...
N: Stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand.
C: STAINER
D: "TSA is not responsible for items lost or damaged in the security screening process..."
E: CONT'D
N: Stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand- written on the back. He reads them aloud.
C: STAINER
D: "...so fuck you."
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kirk enters to find his MOTHER, an attractive old woman, sitting with a short, plain woman about Kirk's age.
C: KIRK
D: Hey Mom. Hey Marnie.
C: MRS. KETTNER
D: Oh, hi Sweetie.
N: Across the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks a bit like Kirk. The man is telling a funny story that cracks up MR. KETTNER. The two pretend to box for a moment.
C: KIRK
D: Who's that guy Dad's with?
N: MARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside.
C: MARNIE
D: Kirk, you've been really great about your mom and I staying so close since we broke up but I know how much Grammy meant to you... Well, is it okay with you that I'm here?
C: KIRK
D: Sure. It's fine.
E: it's not
C: MARNIE
D: Okay, good. Then can I introduce you to my new boyfriend?
N: She leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his father. They are laughing again.
C: MARNIE
D: Ron, this is Kirk.
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! No! I'm just jack-assin' with you, pirate. Great to meet you. How you doing?
E: Ron and Mr. Kettner laugh
C: KIRK
D: I've been better.
C: RON
D: Right. Of course. I'm sorry about your grandmother. It's just so... Well, old people, you know, what are you gonna do?
C: KIRK
D: Yeah. Thanks.
N: Kirk's brother ERIC and his fiance DEBBIE enter from the hall. They are both in their late thirties and good-looking for trailer trash. Debbie is about seven months pregnant.
C: ERIC
D: Little brother. Grammy wants to see you.
C: KIRK
D: Okay. Well, I better get in there.
N: Eric and Debbie walk with Kirk down the hall.
C: ERIC
D: Listen, I'm pretty sure she wants to discuss the will. She won't tell us dick, so we're kind of hoping you can grease the wheels.
C: KIRK
D: Okay, but you know Grammy didn't have all that much. Once the hospital and... and the ah...
C: ERIC
D: Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what not...
C: KIRK
D: Well, it's not going to leave enough to get worked up over.
C: DEBBIE
D: We've got a wedding to pay for, Kirk and...
C: ERIC
D: Debbie, let me handle this. We've got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts, and you know Mom and Dad are going to Branson next month. Now you always been Grammy's favorite so we're counting on you to get in there and sort out what's what.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - GRAMMY'S ROOM
N: In a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed. She is hooked up to an I.V. and several monitors. Kirk comes in and forces a smile. Grammy's voice is weak and shaky.
C: GRAMMY
D: There you are Big Slick. Did you bring 'em?
C: KIRK
D: Grammy, you really shouldn't...
C: GRAMMY
D: Just hand 'em over. I'm on death's door and you know it.
N: Kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes.
C: GRAMMY
D: Oh, for Christ's sake. Filters?
E: CONT'D
N: Grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag. Kirk tears up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life.
C: KIRK
D: I love you Grammy.
C: GRAMMY
D: Don't start that shit now. You're looking at one lucky old broad who's done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby, colored fellas. I got no complaints. So when the check comes I don't want any blubbering or bullshit outta you. Just enjoy your life like I did mine and raise a glass to your old Grammy once in a while.
N: Kirk hugs her and he cries a bit.
C: GRAMMY
D: You know how much I love you Kirk.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
N: Molly is coming through Kirk's lane again. Mr. Fuller steps in and stops her before she crosses through.
C: FULLER
D: Ma'am, could you please remove your jacket and shoes?
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, sure.
N: She does. Fuller is leering at her stellar body. She's about to go through when he stops her again.
C: FULLER
D: Why don't we go ahead and strip off that belt too while we're at it.
N: Molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt. She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a raised palm. He then motions to her breasts and crotch.
C: FULLER
D: Any piercings you'd like me to know about?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Why don't you just come on through, ma'am, and we'll see if anything sets off the machine.
N: Molly steps through. The machine does not go off. She gathers her things and mouths a silent, "Thank You" to Kirk as she walks on. Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say anything, RANDY, a young agent, calls out from the office.
C: RANDY
D: Kirk buddy! Phone call!
N: Kirk walks over to take the call.
C: FULLER
D: You best hope the terrorists are taking personal calls on the job too, mister!
N: Kirk takes the phone from Randy.
C: KIRK
D: This is Kirk Kettner.
N: Kirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in.
S: INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
N: Kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee. He opens his wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an eight-year-old Kirk in a casino. Grammy is smoking a cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table. Kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands. Molly is passing. She sees Kirk and stops.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh Geeze. Please tell me I didn't get you in trouble back there.
C: KIRK
D: No, no. It's not that. I ah...I lost somebody today.
N: Molly sits down and puts her hand on his hand.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I know... I lost my grandmother a few months ago and I...
N: Kirk tears up again and so does Molly.
C: MOLLY
D: Your grandmother too? And you were close? Oh, you poor thing.
E: CONT'D
N: Kirk tries to keep it together. Molly looks at the photo.
C: KIRK
D: She used to be a blackjack dealer at the Horseshoe. When I was little, she taught me and my friends how to play poker. Turned us into a bunch of eight-year-old degenerate gamblers.
N: They share a sad laugh.
C: KIRK
D: So, your grandmother too, huh?
E: CONT'D
N: Molly removes a small clear-plastic booklet of photos from her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother.
C: MOLLY
D: My Grammy Keenan was ninety four but independent right to the end. She was always trying to cook for everyone. You couldn't stop her.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, God, I know. Grammy used to change her own oil. Right up until a few months ago. She was... Do you change your own oil?
C: MOLLY
D: No. I wouldn't know where to begin.
E: LAUGHS
C: KIRK
D: I know, me neither. She could barley walk and I'd come over and find her lying under her Cadillac all covered in grease.
N: They share a laugh and Kirk is cheering up a bit. An announcement comes over the PA.
C: GATE AGENT
D: ...final boarding call for United flight 94 to Burbank...
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, geeze, that's me. I'm so sorry.
C: KIRK
D: No, no. Go catch your flight.
N: Molly stands and offers her hand to Kirk.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm Molly.
C: KIRK
D: Kirk Kettner.
N: Molly squeezes Kirk's hand, grabs her bags and trots off toward her gate. A businessman near Kirk's table reaches over and gives him a playful chuck on the shoulder.
C: BUSINESSMAN
D: Dead Grandma. Nice one.
E: a nod and a cheek click
S: INT. AIRPORT GATE
N: Molly arrives at the gate just in time to make her flight.
S: INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP
N: Kirk gathers his things and notices that Molly left her pictures on the table. He looks through them. In the last pouch are some business cards that read, "Molly McCall - Event Planner." Her cell number is on the card.
S: INT. AIRPLANE 737
N: Molly is sitting in a window seat. The flight is mostly empty. The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a CREEPY BUSINESSMAN moves from the row behind her to the seat next to Molly. He casually smiles as though there is nothing odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and many full rows) are open. Molly looks at the vacant seats and then at him as if to say, "You've got to be kidding."
C: CREEPY BUSINESSMAN
D: How you doin'?
N: Molly's phone rings and she fumbles to answer it. A FEMALE PASSENGER sitting two rows back looks annoyed.
T: INTERCUT: AIRPLANE / AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP
C: MOLLY
D: Hello?
C: KIRK
D: Oh, hi. Molly McCall?
C: MOLLY
D: Who's calling please?
C: KIRK
D: It's Kirk... From the coffee shop. You left your pictures with me. If you tell me which gate you're at, I can run them right down to you.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, no. I'm already on the plane and we're pushing back right now.
C: KIRK
D: Okay, well I'll leave them at the lost and found and when you get...
C: MOLLY
D: Oh geeze, some of those are my only prints. It would be such a huge favor if you could hold on to them for me. I'm coming back next week.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, sure. But how will I...
N: The female passenger hails the flight attendant.
C: FEMALE PASSENGER
D: She's talking on her phone.
N: The creepy businessman gives the woman the finger and then looks to Molly for approval. He doesn't get it.
C: MOLLY
D: I have your number in my phone. As soon as I get back I'll call you and arrange to pick them up, okay? Thank you so much, Kirk.
N: Molly turns off her phone and holds it up for the flight attendant to see.
C: MOLLY
D: Thanks. I'm really sorry.
E: CONT'D
C: CREEPY BUSINESSMAN
D: You believe these pricks? So, what do you do?
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. VERTIGO CLUB - NIGHT
N: Kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer. Two men are waving to him from a table near the stage. Kirk gets his bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends. On stage, Stainer (in his afro wig) plays guitar as his band finishes the last chorus of "Lovin', Touchin' Squeezin'."
C: STAINER
D: Thank you! We're going to take a little breakski but we'll be back in a few minutes to do Frontiers.
N: The band turns to put down their instruments and the house music kicks in. Kirk arrives where his friends are standing at a high bar table. DEVON looks like Howdy Doody at 33. JACK is good- looking and dressed semi-hipster. Devon gives Kirk a hug.
C: DEVON
D: Hey Kirk. How you been holdin' up?
C: KIRK
D: It's been a rough week but, you know, all of the services and family stuff keep you pretty busy... I really miss her, though.
N: Jack hugs Kirk as well.
C: JACK
D: She sounded like a hell of a lady.
C: STAINER
D: Oh, fuck yeah! Kirk's Grandma was the shit.
E: O.S.
N: Stainer arrives, hugs Kirk and gives him a kiss on the head.
C: STAINER
D: She's with God now, buddy - and you just know she's bustin' his balls.
E: CONT'D
N: Kirk laughs and Stainer raises his glass.
C: STAINER
D: To Stella!
E: CONT'D
N: The guys all raise their glasses and take a drink. This is just what Grammy wanted and it's cheering Kirk up. Kirk's cell phone rings. He has to talk loud over the music.
C: KIRK
D: Hello?... Oh, Hi. I'm sorry I can barely hear you. I'm at a club and.... Club Vertigo? Oh, yeah - it's right down the street from there... Okay, sounds good.
N: Kirk hangs up.
C: JACK
D: What was that all about?
C: KIRK
D: Nothing, just a passenger. She accidentally left something with me. She's going to stop in and pick it up I guess.
C: DEVON
D: She's coming here? She a cute gal?
C: KIRK
D: Very.
C: STAINER
D: Well alright dude! That's a leave- behind. She digs you!
C: KIRK
D: No she doesn't. Trust me.
C: STAINER
D: She does a leave behind and then just happens to be in the neighborhood? She practically has her hands in your pants.
C: KIRK
D: No, seriously - it's nothing. She's way out of my league.
C: STAINER
D: Dude, you said Marnie was out of your league and let's face it, Marnie's kinda nasty.
N: Marnie is standing behind Stainer. He doesn't miss a beat.
C: STAINER
D: ...Marnie...don't you think Marnie Tomkins is kind of nasty?
E: CONT'D
C: MARNIE
D: I don't know who that is.
C: STAINER
D: Oh, you don't know Marnie Tomkins? She's just this girl. I thought you knew her. Anyway, she's pretty nasty looking... but you're looking good.
C: MARNIE
D: Kirk, I'm sorry about Grammy.
N: The guys slink away to give Kirk and Marnie some privacy.
C: MARNIE
D: I realize she was never that crazy about me but I know how much you loved her and I hope you're okay.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Thanks. Thanks, I'll be alright.
C: MARNIE
D: Listen, are you going to Branson with your folks next month?
C: KIRK
D: No. It's not really my thing.
C: MARNIE
D: What's wrong with Branson? You too good for Branson now?
C: KIRK
D: No. Branson's...awesome.
C: MARNIE
D: Well, your mom invited Ron and I along. We'd love to go but not if it's going to be weird for you.
N: Kirk considers this. It will be weird.
C: MARNIE
D: ...I mean the tickets are non- refundable but it's up to you.
E: CONT'D
N: Stainer overhears this and groans out loud.
C: KIRK
D: No. You should go. I'm sure you'll have a great time. Totally.
N: Marnie hugs Kirk. This makes him uncomfortable.
C: MARNIE
D: Kirk, I'm sorry about what happened with us. You're going to make someone very happy someday, but you have to get over me first, okay? Is it a deal?
N: Marnie hugs him again and then departs.
C: STAINER
D: She's going to Branson with your fucking parents? And bringing her new fucking boyfriend!?
C: KIRK
D: Yeah. He seems like a good guy, though. He's an entrepreneur.
N: Across the room they see Marnie return to Ron with a hug.
C: JACK
D: Entrepreneur? Kirk, I know that guy. He owns a Pizza Hut.
C: KIRK
D: So? That's a business.
C: STAINER
D: It's not even a real Pizza Hut. It's one of those strip-mall take- out ones. They don't even have chicken wings. The guy's a fuckin' douche bag.
C: KIRK
D: He's got more going on than I do. That's all I'm saying.
C: STAINER
D: Dude, you can do a hell of a lot better than her.
C: DEVON
D: One door closes, another door opens.
C: STAINER
D: Fuck you Devon, that doesn't even make any sense. But take this broad that's coming here tonight - I got a feeling about her. You're gonna get on that.
C: JACK
D: Absolutely. Visualize it.
C: KIRK
D: I appreciate what you guys are trying to do but, I'm telling you, I have zero chance with this one and I'm completely okay with that.
C: DEVON
D: That's defeatist thinking.
C: KIRK
D: No it isn't. It's just like saying I'll never go to the moon and I'm okay with that too.
C: STAINER
D: You're saying you don't want to go to the moon? That's bullshit.
C: KIRK
D: No. I'm saying that I never will go to the moon but I'm not going to get down about it because, you know - I never expected to.
C: STAINER
D: You don't know. Technology and shit. You might go to the moon.
N: Kirk waves to someone at the door. The guys look up. The guys' POV: Molly is stepping toward them - dressed in a beautiful gown. They laugh the way you might laugh at a particularly brutal football tackle.
C: DEVON
D: Holy Frijole.
C: JACK
D: Oh shit. Yeah, you're right.
C: STAINER
D: Sorry, bro. You'll go to the moon before you'll hit that. No chance.
C: KIRK
D: I told you.
N: Molly arrives at their table.
C: MOLLY
D: Hey! There you are!
N: Molly hugs Kirk. From across the bar, Marnie takes notice.
C: KIRK
D: Here I am.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm sorry I'm so overdressed. I just came from a work thing. Are you doing okay with...everything?
C: KIRK
D: Oh, you know... Hey, these are my best friends - Jack, Devon and Stainer.
N: The guys' I.Q.s drop like stones as they shake her hand.
C: MOLLY
D: Stainer?
C: STAINER
D: Yeah, just a nickname. Doesn't really mean nothin'.
C: KIRK
D: Oh. Here's your pictures - all safe and sound.
N: Kirk hands Molly the pictures.
C: MOLLY
D: Thank you so much for taking care of them for me! I need to get some copies made. If I lost these...uugh.
C: KIRK
D: No trouble at all.
C: MOLLY
D: Hey, have you eaten yet?
C: KIRK
D: Um...
C: MOLLY
D: I was going to go grab a bite. Let me buy you dinner to pay you back.
C: KIRK
D: You don't have to pay me back.
C: MOLLY
D: I know. I want to. Come on! The place across the street has the best greasy burgers in town.
C: KIRK
D: A burger does sound good. I'm going to just ah...
E: then to the guys
N: Molly waves goodbye and heads for the door. Kirk starts to follow but Stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle.
C: STAINER
D: Dude. It's cool that she's buying you dinner but do not get your hopes up about this one.
C: KIRK
D: Don't worry. Believe me, I know.
N: Kirk catches up with Molly. Marnie watches them exit. A big guy has overheard this and leans over to Stainer.
C: BIG GUY
D: Good advice there friend. Your boy ain't got a prayer with that chick.
C: STAINER
D: You talking shit about my buddy!? 'Cause I'm giving out free fuckin' ambulance rides!
N: Big Guy assesses the crazy on Stainer's face and stands down.
C: STAINER
D: Yeah, I didn't think so!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BURGER JOINT - NIGHT
N: Kirk and Molly sit across from one another in a booth. The WAITER arrives.
C: WAITER
D: Start you off with something to drink ma'am?
C: MOLLY
D: I'll have a Bass.
C: WAITER
D: And for your... brother?
C: KIRK
D: What? Oh, I'm not her brother.
C: WAITER
D: Oh, I'm sorry. I just figured...
C: KIRK
D: You know what, a Bass sounds good. Make that two.
C: WAITER
D: Great. Sorry.
N: The waiter exits.
C: KIRK
D: So... You know what I do, what about you? Your card said event planner. How'd you get into that?
C: MOLLY
D: Well, it wasn't the original plan. I went to law school. Ended up at a big firm but I hated it. Then, they asked me to plan the Christmas party. It was a big hit and a few months later I was done with law.
C: KIRK
D: Wow.
C: MOLLY
D: I know. Pernicious career move, right?
C: KIRK
D: Oh, I don't know what that word means. What was it?
N: Close on Molly's smile. She finds Kirk's unabashed admission very refreshing and endearing.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm sorry. Like, destructive or...
C: KIRK
D: Oh, okay. No, I don't think that's so perni...gious?
C: MOLLY
D: Pernicious.
C: KIRK
D: Good - new word. No, not pernicious at all. Not if you enjoy the work.
C: MOLLY
D: I really do. We do a lot of charity events and I get to work with some of the most amazing human beings on some really fun projects. Next month I'm doing a cancer benefit with Billy Joel.
C: KIRK
D: Wow. I love Billy Joel.
C: MOLLY
D: The only downside is I have to do a lot of public speaking and I've always struggled with stage fright.
C: KIRK
D: Oh man - That's my number one fear. I'm terrified of getting up in front of people. I'd rather get a Kentucky root canal.
N: Molly laughs. An older GOOD-LOOKING MAN steps up to the table and stands facing her with his back to Kirk.
C: GOOD-LOOKING MAN
D: Excuse me, I was just sitting over at the bar and I was wondering; has anyone told you today that you are absolutely stunning?
C: MOLLY
D: Are you seriously hitting on me right in front of my boyfriend?
N: He turns to Kirk and both men start to laugh.
C: GOOD-LOOKING MAN
D: This is your boyfriend?
C: KIRK
D: Oh, yeah right! But, yeah. I'm her boyfriend, I guess, so...
E: Catches Molly's unspoken instructions.
C: GOOD-LOOKING MAN
D: Really? Wow. Well... sorry.
C: KIRK
D: Honest mistake.
N: The man gives Kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar.
C: MOLLY
D: Did you get a load of that hair- piece? What is it with men? I mean, look at you. You're bald and you're fine with it. A little dignity is all I'm saying. The toupees and plugs and the teen- dream sports cars... Oh geeze, I'm sorry. Do you drive a sports car?
C: KIRK
D: I drive a 94 Taurus. It's got AM/FM but I wouldn't call it a sports car per se.
N: Molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh.
C: KIRK
D: So here's this little old lady trying to go through security with six pounds of weed in her girdle!
E: CONT'D
N: Cut. The food is being served.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, my God! I love that book!
N: Cut. The waitress is picking up the empty plates.
C: KIRK
D: So, a duck walks into a bar...
N: Cut. Molly is laughing while she's paying the bill.
C: MOLLY
D: Well, I've got an early morning. I should go. Thanks for coming along. This was really fun. And thanks again for helping me out.
C: KIRK
D: No, thank you for dinner. I feel bad that you won't let me...
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, stop it. Listen, I handle some of the charity events for the Coyotes and I've got some tickets for the hockey game tomorrow night. You interested?
N: Kirk is a bit taken aback and confused. Is she actually asking him out on a real date?
C: KIRK
D: Um, sure. Yeah, great. I mean, I'm free tomorrow night.
E: NERVOUSLY
N: She digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over.
C: MOLLY
D: Perfect. I hate to see them go to waste. There's two so maybe bring Stainer?
N: Kirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, right. Thanks! Thank you.
S: EXT. HOCKEY ARENA - NIGHT
N: Kirk and Stainer are on their way through security. A huge security guard runs a metal-detector wand over Stainer.
C: STAINER
D: Whatcha runnin' there a PX-235?
C: GUARD
D: I don't know sir.
C: STAINER
D: The two hundred series are dog shit. You couldn't find a bazooka with that thing. You should look into the new eight fifties.
C: GUARD
D: Can you keep it moving sir?
S: INT. HOCKEY ARENA
N: Kirk and Stainer arrive at the third row to find two open seats right next to the penalty box. To Kirk's surprise, in the next seat - Molly! Kirk elbows Stainer.
C: KIRK
D: Hey, it's Molly. She's here.
C: STAINER
D: Huh.
E: PERPLEXED
C: MOLLY
D: Hey guys! You made it! Hooray! Thanks for coming.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, yeah. Wouldn't miss it.
C: STAINER
D: Thanks for the sweet seats!
C: MOLLY
D: Guys, this is my best friend in the whole world, Patty. This is Kirk and, um, Stainer, right?
N: Patty is over 200 pounds with a pretty face and an edge that comes from a lifetime of taking crap from morons.
C: PATTY
D: Hey boys. Nice to meet you.
C: MOLLY
D: Patty's my assistant and my go-to gal. Whatever you need, she can make it happen on a moments notice.
C: PATTY
D: You need a cock-shaped cake with a cotton-candy bush delivered by four o'clock? I'm your connection.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, and she likes to shock people so don't let her freak you out.
C: KIRK
D: How 'bout that. So, we're going to grab some beers. Can we bring you ladies anything? Beer? Nachos? Patty, cotton candy?
S: INT. HOCKEY ARENA CONCESSIONS AREA
N: Stainer and Kirk stand in the beer line.
C: STAINER
D: That's it. She's setting you up with the fat chick.
C: KIRK
D: Ooohhh! Okay! Okay! That makes sense, right!? When Molly was here I was like, "what!?" But, okay! Well, Patty seems cool. She's funny.
C: STAINER
D: Well, yeah, she has to be.
C: KIRK
D: What does that mean?
C: STAINER
D: Nothing. The fat chick seems great. You never know, bro, that fat chick could wind up being the love of your life.
N: Kirk returns a look of annoyance.
C: STAINER
D: Patty, I'm saying. Patty could be the love of your life.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOCKEY ARENA
N: The game has started. Kirk, Stainer, Molly and Patty are cheering. The puck smacks the glass before them and another player skates up for it. As he mucks it from the edge, he looks up and sees Molly. He's distracted just long enough to get brutally checked face first into the glass. A penalty is called on the player who hit him. That player skates into the penalty box near Molly. The name on his jersey reads, "REESE." He speaks with a thick Canadian accent.
C: REESE
D: Hey Molly! Yer lookin' good, eh!
C: MOLLY
D: That was a bogus call, Bobby. Your skates barely left the ice.
C: REESE
D: I know. What's that aboot, eh?
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, that ref is like a total blindo, man.
E: nervously to Reese
C: STAINER
D: Blindo?
C: PATTY
D: Kirk, Molly's sister is blind.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, I know. It's fine.
E: not offended
S: INT. BROADCAST BOOTH
N: The radio announcers are calling the game.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Forty Five seconds left on the Power Play and the Sharks are knocking at the door.
S: INT. HOCKEY ARENA
C: REESE
D: So, after the game, you wanna party?
C: MOLLY
D: You know my policy on players, Bobby. And you might have noticed we've already got dates.
N: The penalty ends and the ref opens the box but Reese is not paying attention.
C: REESE
D: Come on, Molly. Just give me a chance, eh. I'm a great guy - ask any of these assholes.
N: The crowd is booing Reese.
C: MOLLY
D: Reese, you'd better...
C: REESE
D: You can't seriously be blowing me off for these two hosers.
C: STAINER
D: Hey! Fuck you Reese! You suck this year anyway!
N: Reese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts Stainer.
C: STAINER
D: You dick!
E: CONT'D
N: Stainer is immediately on his feet, climbing the glass and trying to pummel the huge player. Security is on him in a flash and dragging him, kicking & swearing, out of the arena. Reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late. The Sharks score and the crowd revolts. A red-haired redneck woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to Molly and company.
C: RED-HAIRED WOMAN
D: You idiots just cost us a goal! I hope you're happy!
C: PATTY
D: You'd better check that tone, Reba! You do NOT want me comin' up there!
C: MOLLY
D: Patty! Stop it! I'll go see what I can do about Stainer.
C: KIRK
D: No, this is my fault, I'll take care of it.
C: MOLLY
D: No, it's okay. I know the head of security. I'll be right back.
N: Molly exits and Patty sits back down next to Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: God, I'm really embarrassed.
C: PATTY
D: That's okay, if Reese did that to me I'd have gone over the glass too. But I would have landed a few before they got me. Reese has been all over Molly ever since she dumped her boyfriend. I tell you, that girl has nothing but trouble when it comes to men.
C: KIRK
D: What? How is that even possible? She's so...
C: PATTY
D: Tell me about it. I'm no lezbo but sometimes she makes me want to strap on - if know what I'm saying.
C: KIRK
D: Yeah. I think I do.
C: PATTY
D: It's a curse, looking like that. Who has the balls to hit on her? Just the most arrogant A-holes like Reese out there.
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, I suppose.
C: PATTY
D: Listen, Molly brought me along tonight because, you know, she thought I might be 'interested.'
C: KIRK
D: Oh. Oh yeah?
C: PATTY
D: But, just for honesty's sake, I'm not interested. No offense.
C: KIRK
D: No! Hey! None taken. I don't blame you. I know I'm no Brad Pitt. That's cool.
C: PATTY
D: What? You? No, I'm talking about your pal, Stainer. I know he's your friend but he seems like kind of a dumbshit. Wait. Why would you think I was talking about you?
E: THEN
C: KIRK
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to assume anything.
C: PATTY
D: Oh my God. You don't have a clue do you? Molly's really into you.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, yeah right!
N: Kirk laughs hard until he realizes that Patty isn't laughing. Patty's nod says, "I'm serious."
C: KIRK
D: But... why would...
E: CONT'D
C: PATTY
D: A knockout like Molly be interested in a spud like you?
C: KIRK
D: Well, yeah.
C: PATTY
D: Got me. Again, no offense. But listen, Kirk, your dream girl just showed up. Try not to blow it.
N: Close on Kirk's terrified expression. The SOUND of a bowling ball demolishing ten pins...
S: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
N: The place is crowded and classic rock is cranking. It's an old alley with overhead-projection score sheets. Kirk, Stainer and Devon sit and talk while Jack throws a strike.
C: DEVON
D: Atta boy Jackers!
C: STAINER
D: It doesn't add up, Kirk. If Molly's so into you, why bring her friend and give you two tickets?
C: KIRK
D: She was hoping to set Patty up with you.
C: STAINER
D: Oh, great.
C: KIRK
D: It's okay, she wasn't interested.
C: STAINER
D: So you're saying the hottest babe in the world wants you and the fat chick isn't into me. Will you listen to yourself? Fuck you.
E: MORE
C: STAINER
D: What did Molly have to say about all this?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: I don't know, Stainer, somebody got thrown out of the game and I had to drive him home, remember?
C: DEVON
D: Pretty impressive catch, Kirky.
C: STAINER
D: There's no way. Don't get him all worked up. Her friend was fuckin' with him. Molly said herself that Patty loves to mess with people.
C: DEVON
D: Kirk, you deserve a gal like her. And Stainer, why don't you try to be a little more supportive.
C: STAINER
D: Why don't you try a little shut the fuck up, Devon. This week, we're not taking dating tips from the guy who met his wife in eighth grade.
C: JACK
D: Are we still bowling?
N: Stainer picks up a crappy, beat up ball from the ball return.
C: STAINER
D: All I'm saying is - she's just too hot. No judgement on Kirky, the guy's just outgunned here.
C: KIRK
D: I can't argue with him.
N: Stainer goes to the line. The BOWLER (a pro-type with a custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing about to roll. Stainer starts to step up.
C: BOWLER
D: Yo, house ball! I was up first.
C: STAINER
D: Oh for fucks... What is it with you people?
C: BOWLER
D: Just wait your turn.
C: STAINER
D: All this noise and bullshit in this place and I'm such a distraction over here in your god damned peripheral vision!?
C: KIRK
D: Okay Stains, take it easy.
N: The bowler stands glaring back.
C: STAINER
D: Well!? Fuckin' roll then!
N: The bowler takes another minute to set. Stainer lets out a long sigh. The bowler steps to the line and Stainer rushes into his own delivery. Both men throw gutters. The bowler comes at Stainer but their friends separate them.
C: BOWLER
D: You're lucky motherfucker!
C: STAINER
D: Oh yeah!? Bring it, Brunswick!
C: DEVON
D: Stainer! Cool your jets, buster.
N: The bowler's friends drag him away. Stainer takes a deep breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode.
C: STAINER
D: Okay. Anyway... I love Kirky but let's face it, the guy's a three.
C: DEVON
D: Stainer, that's just dirty pool. He's at least a four.
C: STAINER
D: You're outta your fuckin' mind - four! You go ahead and pump rainbows up his ass. I'm just being honest.
N: Stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the glass. It projects onto the overhead scoreboard.
C: KIRK
D: I can live with three.
C: STAINER
D: He's a nice guy and he's funny. Those are a half a point each.
N: Stainer continues the equation on the projector.
C: STAINER
D: But he drives a shit box so we gotta deduct a point for that.
E: CONT'D
C: DEVON
D: Kirk said she likes his Taurus.
C: STAINER
D: That's so fucked, I won't even dignify it with a response. So we're back to three. Meanwhile, this Molly is a hard ten.
C: DEVON
D: A hard ten?
C: STAINER
D: Generally, if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sister's blind. That's a hard ten, friends, and that is rare. A seven point disparity - that's a chasm. The most you can jump is two points. I can't even get a ten.
C: JACK
D: Oh, not even you, huh?
C: STAINER
D: I'm a five, okay?
C: JACK
D: Bullshit. Then what am I?
C: STAINER
D: You're a seven and a half.
C: JACK
D: Fine, you're a five then.
C: STAINER
D: Okay, so I get a two point bump for being in a band. That puts me at seven. On a good day, most I can bag is a niner.
C: KIRK
D: What about your shitty car?
C: STAINER
D: Artist exemption. I'm expected to have a shitty car.
C: JACK
D: Is there an artist exemption for being a jag-off?
C: STAINER
D: Fuckin' A there is.
C: KIRK
D: Stainer's right. Patty was probably just messing around. It's not a big deal. Let's just bowl.
C: DEVON
D: What about Rick Ocasek? Billy Joel, Donald Trump...
C: STAINER
D: Yeah, dumbass. Those are the wild- cards. Money and fame.
C: JACK
D: So, if he were a millionaire?
C: STAINER
D: A mil ain't what it once was, Jackie. Devon's practically a millionaire for Christ sake. A mil might get you an eight but to bring down a ten now days - two million minimum.
N: Stainer finishes the equation by writing, "Kirk = Fucked." Kirk's phone rings. He checks the ID and his eyes go wide.
C: KIRK
D: Hey, Molly... Um, yeah, sure... No, that sounds good. Yeah, I know where that is. Um, okay, yeah... see you then.
E: into the phone
N: Kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends, who wait in suspense.
C: KIRK
D: Holy crap. She just asked me out for tomorrow night!
E: CONT'D dazed pause
N: Kirk exchanges fives, fists, tips and hugs with Devon and Jack. Stainer shakes his head, still not buying it.
S: INT. BOWLING ALLEY MEN'S ROOM
N: Kirk runs into the otherwise empty restroom. He stares into the mirror and his smile fades into panic. He splashes water on his face. He reaches for a paper towel but the dispenser is empty.
C: KIRK
D: It's okay. Get it together. Guys do this all the time. You can do this. You can make it happen.
E: to himself
C: RANDOM MAN'S VOICE
D: You better not be jerking off in the sink, man!
E: O.S. from inside a stall
S: EXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Kirk's Taurus pulls into a space. He climbs out and slams the door. As it closes, he reaches but too late. He looks through the window. The keys are hanging in the ignition.
S: INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
N: WILLY, the Russian driver, is chipper and bubbly as he sings along with "I'm Like a Bird" on the radio. Kirk is knocked around by Willy's crazy driving. In the mirror, Willy notices Kirk's dazed expression.
C: WILLY
D: Kirk! You look like someone made a second number in your breakfast cereal. You are doing okay, yes?
E: thick accent
C: KIRK
D: You know what Willy. I honestly don't know how I'm doing.
C: WILLY
D: He does not know!
C: KIRK
D: I should be doing awesome but I don't know. Know what I mean?
C: WILLY
D: Nope!
C: KIRK
D: How are you?
C: WILLY
D: Perfect! Willy is having another kick ass of a day.
N: Willy takes a hard left and some suitcases fall on Kirk.
S: INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT - DAY
N: Kirk is picking up a coffee. As he walks on, he takes a sip. The lid comes off and hot coffee spills on his shirt.
C: STAINER
D: Way to go, Big Slick.
E: O.S.
N: Stainer is now next to Kirk, who glares back at him as they walk across the food court. A short, plain girl behind the Orange Julius counter gives them an apprehensive wave.
C: STAINER
D: Oh, shit. Let's go this way.
E: CONT'D
N: Stainer returns an uncomfortable smile but then redirects their path away from her. Kirk waves.
C: KIRK
D: Who's that?
C: STAINER
D: Nobody. Just some chick I boned once when I was drunk. You look like shit, bro.
C: KIRK
D: Thanks. I had trouble sleeping last night. This Molly thing... I don't want to want this, you know? It just seems too good to be true. I just don't get it.
C: STAINER
D: I know what you mean. There has to be some explanation.
C: KIRK
D: I can't think of one. Not one that makes any sense.
C: STAINER
D: Well, let's spitball it a little. You've got dick for money so she's no gold digger. Oohh! Did you ever see Double Indemnity?
C: KIRK
D: Please don't say she wants me to kill someone.
C: STAINER
D: Okay, then... maybe she's on a scavenger hunt. You know, like find a wagon wheel, a wiffle ball bat and a fat, bald TSA agent - that kind of thing.
N: Kirk is no longer responding.
C: STAINER
D: Oh, shit, dude. Al Qaeda. Think about it. You're a TSA agent, she's a terrorist...
E: CONT'D
N: Kirk walks away.
S: EXT. OLD STRIP MALL - DAY
N: Kirk, still in his TSA uniform, walks past a large laundromat to a small storefront next door. The chipped and faded lettering on the glass reads, "Maury Hammerstein, Attorney At Law - Aggressive, Dynamic Representation Since 1942!" As Kirk reaches for the door, he notices a small hand-written sign, "I don't make change!" He goes inside.
S: INT. LAW OFFICE
N: Wood paneling, buzzing fluorescent lights and furniture the Salvation Army would sell only as firewood. Eric and Debbie sit with Kirk's parents. There are two elderly women and another middle aged man in the room as well. Maury, who's about a hundred years old - cute and meek, fusses with an ancient VCR while smoking a cigarette. Kirk sits down next to Eric. Kirk notices a free bank calender on Maury's desk - dated 1991.
C: ERIC
D: It's about time, numbnuts.
C: KIRK
D: I came right from work.
C: MR. KETTNER
D: Okay Maury - we're all here.
C: MAURY
D: Oh! You bet! You betcha! Okay, hi there Kirk. Firstly, let me just say how awful sorry I am. Stella was one heck of a gal and a real dish. Anyhow, let me just...
N: Maury gets the VCR going. "Wheel of Fortune" comes up on the screen.
C: MAURY
D: Oh mercy. I didn't tape over her with The Wheel did I?
E: CONT'D
N: The picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of Grammy sitting in her kitchen. She has just clicked the video camera on with a remote control.
C: MAURY
D: Oh, good. There she is.
E: CONT'D
C: GRAMMY
D: Testing. One, two, three, four. Oh, this God damned thing!
N: She gets up and fusses with the camera.
C: GRAMMY
D: Jap piece of shit! Is it on!?
E: CONT'D
N: Cutaway to Kirk tearing up. Grammy sits back down.
C: GRAMMY
D: Okay, my name is Stella Edith Dakin and if you're watching this, I'm dead as a doorknob and I ain't spent all my money yet. I got shit to do today so I'm going to get right to it. This is my last will and testament and if you miss anything the old Jew's got the paperwork. Okay, here's the deal...
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone besides Kirk leans in, excited to hear what they might get. A phone rings. Maury looks around but the ringing is coming from the TV. Grammy answers the phone.
C: GRAMMY
D: Hello? I'm kind of busy right now Eric... Oh, for God's sake, boy! How can you be sure it's even yours? It could be practically anybody's!... No, I'm not paying for that!... Well, then I guess you're going to be a daddy. Congratulations, now I gotta go!
E: CONT'D
N: She hangs up, puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke.
C: GRAMMY
D: Anyway! I love all of you, despite some of the shit you pulled, but I spent my life a gambler and I always put my money on the best bet. The odds of any of you fish doing anything worthwhile with my stack are slim to none. So old Grammy's going all in on Big Slick.
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone looks at Kirk who is stunned.
C: GRAMMY
D: I'm proud of you, Kirk. Don't let your old Grammy down. Do something good with it.
E: CONT'D
N: She blows a kiss, lifts the remote and aims it at the camera.
C: GRAMMY
D: Oh, for Christ sakes!
E: CONT'D
N: She throws the remote at the lens. The picture goes to snow.
C: ERIC
D: So Kirk gets it all!? That is bullshit!
C: KIRK
D: Eric, it can't be much.
C: ERIC
D: Well!?
N: Maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers. He dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic.
C: MAURY
D: Let's see here... Looks like she had herself six G's in savings.
E: MORE
C: MAURY
D: Um, another three grand in bonds, give or take. Her life insurance will pay pert-near seventy grand.
E: CONT'D
N: He adds this up on an old adding machine (the kind with the hand crank) and writes $77,800 on a chalk board, which is mounted on the wall behind him.
C: ERIC
D: She left him eighty grand!?
C: MAURY
D: Most of Stella's retirement home expenses were covered by her reverse mortgage. But, figure in thirty thousand still due to Arborwood Village. She racked up forty-seven thousand in medical bills. And my fee, of course, which now stands at two thousand and change - which is real reasonable, folks.
N: He writes "Liabilities = $79,000 Total -$1,200."
C: ERIC
D: So Kirk owes money!? HA! Shit, man! That is God damn hilarious!
S: INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The upscale restaurant is crowded. Kirk and Molly are eating at a small table. Kirk is not relaxed like he had been the last time they ate together. He is sweating and trying to remain cool. The Maitre d is eyeing them suspiciously.
C: MOLLY
D: But, you can't legally be held responsible for her debt. What kind of hack is this attorney?
C: KIRK
D: It's okay. I had it in savings.
N: The waiter brings a drink to Molly.
C: WAITER
D: Madame. From ze gentleman in ze grey suit.
E: French accent
N: From his table, a good looking man smiles and raises a drink to Molly. She nods back - polite but annoyed.
C: KIRK
D: Anyway... Grammy hated owing anyone money. I'm afraid she couldn't rest if she wasn't square with the house. It's the least I can do. She practically raised me.
C: MOLLY
D: You're a good man, Kirk.
N: Molly smiles and takes his hands. The maitre d is watching and getting angry. The waiter returns with another drink.
C: WAITER
D: From ze gentleman in ze purple tie.
N: Another guy raises his glass to her from the bar. Molly is getting irritated. Kirk is feeling smaller every minute.
C: MOLLY
D: Listen, no more drinks. Please.
C: WAITER
D: Of course. No more drinks, madame.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm sorry. This happens sometimes.
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, I get that a lot too. I'm sure the next one will be for me.
N: Molly laughs. The best looking man Kirk has ever seen walks up to the table. He and Molly hug.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, my gosh! Talon! I didn't realize you were in town already.
C: TALON
D: I just flew in this morning.
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk, this is Talon. This is my good friend, Kirk.
C: TALON
D: Great to meet you, sir.
N: Talon gives Kirk a winning handshake, complete with wink.
C: TALON
D: So, do we have you for our Disabled Angels Program again this year?
E: CONT'D
C: MOLLY
D: Wouldn't miss it.
C: TALON
D: That's fantastic. Mol is always a big hit with the kids.
E: to Kirk
C: MOLLY
D: Please. You're the one the kids go crazy for.
C: KIRK
D: So you two work together?
C: MOLLY
D: Only once a year. Talon is our charity liaison at the air show.
C: TALON
D: And?
C: MOLLY
D: And my ex-boyfriend.
N: Kirk starts to choke. He grabs his water glass and takes a swig but the ice collapses and the water pours all over him.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, boy. I guess I better...
N: Kirk heads off to the bathroom, muttering to himself.
C: KIRK
D: Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT MEN'S ROOM
N: Kirk is drying his shirt. A man is still zipping up as he takes the next sink. Before washing, he offers a handshake.
C: MAX
D: Excuse me. My name is Max Fleming. I'm a financial planner.
N: Kirk takes the handshake reluctantly and then gets a business card. Max then starts to wash up - so does Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, Hi.
C: MAX
D: Please forgive me but I'm curious. Who manages your portfolio?
C: KIRK
D: My portfolio? I don't really...
N: Max takes the last paper towel - forcing Kirk to drip dry.
C: MAX
D: It's okay if you'd rather not say. I admit that selling my services in a men's room is a tad aggressive but isn't that what a man of your means requires in his financial planner?
C: KIRK
D: My means.
C: MAX
D: Judging by the company you're keeping, I'd say that you're making a handsome living. I can help you do even better.
S: INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT RESTROOM HALL
N: Kirk exits reading Max's card - somewhat bewildered. The Maitre d stops Kirk and speaks in a French accent.
C: MAITRE D
D: Excusez-moi Monsieur. Might I have a word?
C: KIRK
D: Oh, sure. Is everything all right?
N: The Maitre d looks around and then leans in and speaks quietly - now without the French accent.
C: MAITRE D
D: My kids eat here. My mother's here right now you son of a bitch.
C: KIRK
D: Okay. Did I...
C: MAITRE D
D: Look, I can appreciate that this is not some common street-walker. You're obviously willing to pay for the best but we can't have this kind of thing at my place.
C: KIRK
D: What? I'm not paying anyone. We're just on a date.
C: MAITRE D
D: You are on a date with her? What am I an idiot? Now, I don't wish to embarrass you, sir, or make a scene. So, enjoy your dinner but, be warned, do not ever bring another professional into my place. Tres bien Monsieur!
E: louder and back into the French accent
S: INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT
N: When Kirk rounds the corner, he sees that Molly and Talon are still talking. Kirk hides behind a plant. Molly is beaming. She stands to hug Talon and kiss his cheek before he exits the restaurant. Kirk returns to the table.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, no. Did I miss Talon?
C: MOLLY
D: He had to go but he asked me tell you how much he enjoyed meeting you.
C: KIRK
D: Yeah. Super. He, uh, seems like a great guy.
C: MOLLY
D: He is. He's wonderful. I know, I know - the blue eyes and the rock hard abs, right? But he's really so much more than that. A gallery in New York just opened an exhibit of his photography. He's a genius.
C: KIRK
D: Can we get the check?
E: to the waiter
C: WAITER
D: Madame, your bill has been covered by ze woman in ze Raiders Jacket.
N: A butch woman in the bar raises a glass in Molly's direction.
S: INT. MOLLY'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Molly and Kirk pull into a parking lot.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh my gosh! This is your apartment? I used to live in this neighborhood back in college.
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, I'm gonna move to a better place pretty soon.
C: MOLLY
D: We used to come to parties over here sometimes. Oooohh. Can I come up and see your place?
S: EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
N: It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
N: Kirk and Molly enter. The apartment is neat, clean and fairly sparse.
C: KIRK
D: It's not much, I know.
C: MOLLY
D: No, I like it!
N: Molly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears. Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer comes to life, revealing a "Hot Back-Door Asians" website. Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She moves on to a rack of DVDs.
C: MOLLY
D: Wow, we have a lot of the same DVDs. Life of Brian, Cool Hand Luke, Family Guy... Beaches, Kirk?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: What? It's a good movie.
C: MOLLY
D: I love that movie.
N: She spots a crate full of vinyl records.
C: MOLLY
D: Wow, records. No Way! Look at all this Cheap Trick!
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: You like Cheap Trick?
C: MOLLY
D: Are you kidding? Heaven Tonight is the first album I ever owned! A hand-me-down from my big sister. She was the coolest person in the whole world.
N: She notices an upright piano in the corner.
C: MOLLY
D: You play the piano?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: A little. My grandma taught me. It was kind of our thing. She was a great player. Ragtime, show tunes, that kind of thing. I'm really not very good.
N: She plops down on the couch.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, I'll bet you're great. Play something for me.
C: KIRK
D: No, I can't really play in front of people.
C: MOLLY
D: What, the stage fright thing? Come on it's just me. Please?
C: KIRK
D: No, I really can't. Trust me, you're not missing anything.
N: Kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into a little dance of almost sitting. He finally commits to sit.
C: MOLLY
D: So you've never played in front of anyone?
C: KIRK
D: Nope. Almost did once. A talent show in high school. I just sat up there drenched in sweat. I really thought I could do it but then I made my big mistake.
C: MOLLY
D: Let me guess. You looked at the audience.
C: KIRK
D: Yep. All these eyes on me. I'm shaking, my head is spinning, I'm trying to remember if I even play the piano... and then, I puked.
C: MOLLY
D: Right there on the stage?
C: KIRK
D: INTO the piano actually.
C: MOLLY
D: Shut up! You're lying! Why would you do that?
C: KIRK
D: It was a reflex. I was trying not to barf on the floor. Turns out it's a lot easier to clean puke off a stage than out of a baby grand.
C: MOLLY
D: Yeah, that has to be a real bitch. Oh, I shouldn't be laughing. You poor thing.
N: Molly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic but he does his best to keep it together.
C: KIRK
D: Sorry. I'm a little cotton-mouthed. I'm going to get a glass of water. How 'bout for you? Water? A nice glass of, you know...water?
C: MOLLY
D: Yeah. That sounds good.
N: Kirk steps away from her and disappears into...
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
N: He pours a glass of water. He's about to return when he sees his reflection in the window. The boner under his khakis is not subtle. He looks down and starts to panic.
C: KIRK
D: Um... You want anything to eat?
C: MOLLY
D: No thanks.
E: O.S.
N: Kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in. He takes a few deep, calming breaths. He closes the fridge - still at full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building. He grabs a Time Magazine. He flips through frantically. He turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article.
C: KIRK
D: Oh come on!
N: He is sweating like crazy.
C: MOLLY
D: Can I give you a hand?
E: O.S.
C: KIRK
D: No. I got it!
N: Kirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush. He stares at it hard. His boner begins to retreat.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
C: MOLLY
D: Listen Kirk, I want you to know that I would really like to, you know, to be with you tonight.
C: KIRK
D: Really?
E: O.S.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
N: The boner pops back up. Kirk silently mouths, "MOTHERFUCKER!" at his mischievous little man.
C: MOLLY
D: Well, sure. But... I just don't think I'm ready yet.
E: O.S.
N: Kirk's reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief.
C: KIRK
D: Sure! Sure! Yeah! No problem! Great! That's...that's great! Ice!? You want some ice!?
C: MOLLY
D: Sure.
E: O.S.
N: Kirk opens the freezer. He puts a few cubes in her water and then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
N: Molly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier.
C: MOLLY
D: I mean, don't get me wrong. I want to! Believe me - getting naked and crazy sounds fantastic right now.
C: KIRK
D: Shit!
E: O.S.
C: MOLLY
D: Are you okay?
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, fine.
E: O.S.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
N: Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink. He finds duct tape. He pulls some tape off the roll. It makes a loud noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up. Kirk opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot. He coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll.
C: MOLLY
D: I just think we should get to know each other first. I'm no prude. I mean, I'm pretty generous in bed. Once I trust a person, I like to experiment and get pretty wild.
E: O.S.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, dear God.
C: MOLLY
D: But, I just need to feel safe first.
E: O.S.
N: Kirk finishes taping up, zips his pants and checks his profile in the reflection from the window.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
N: Kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner.
C: KIRK
D: Hey. I'm totally fine with that.
C: MOLLY
D: You're the best.
N: Kirk gives an "aw-shucks" head tilt. Molly stands.
C: MOLLY
D: Okay, well, I'd better go then.
E: CONT'D
N: They walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her fist over her mouth. Kirk's POV: As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch. Kirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way. She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands.
C: MOLLY
D: I had a really nice time. I'll call you tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Great!
N: Kirk opens the door for Molly.
S: EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
N: As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male college students are playing foosball on their patio. They stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk. Molly trots off. COLLEGE STUDENT #1 Damn, man! That chick is fine! Kirk returns a cool "whassup" nod to the guys. COLLEGE STUDENT #2 All right Mr. Kettner! COLLEGE STUDENT #1 You wanna play some foos!?
C: KIRK
D: No thanks fellas.
N: Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
N: He drifts over to his piano and sits down. The joy of what has just happened is plastered on his face. He launches into a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp. Soon a neighbor is pounding on the wall. Kirk stops playing.
C: KIRK
D: Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum!
N: Kirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment. He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it.
C: KIRK
D: Ron seems like a swell guy. I love Pizza Hut. What? Who's this? Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly. Oh, don't be that way. Oh, there, there, now. Here's a tissue.
E: CONT'D
N: He drops the picture and continues the dance.
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls." MONTAGE OVER MUSIC: 1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom. He checks his gut and hairline in the mirror. 2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom and Dad." He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor. He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses underneath him. He checks his phone. "No Missed Calls." 3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the cupboards. He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl. He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal and then checks his phone. "No Missed Calls." 3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten. He checks his phone. He moves on to "BackDoorAsians.com." 4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower third reads, "AMC's 24 Hours of Bond." No Missed Calls. The sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls. Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls. 5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess - tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack. 6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T- shirt he sees reads, "NO MISSED CALLS."
T: MUSIC FADES OUT
S: INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY
N: He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room. Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch. In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives for it, losing his towel in the process.
C: KIRK
D: Hello!? Hello!?
C: STAINER
D: Took you long enough. What were you doing, taking a growler?
E: V.O.
N: Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him. She can see his ass through the window. He covers up.
C: KIRK
D: Sorry, Mrs. Nuesbaum.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY
N: Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.
C: STAINER
D: Kirk, it's a simple rule of life. Look around. People are pretty evenly matched.
N: Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk. Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty, ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one who asked me out. So, why...
C: STAINER
D: That first night, were you intimidated by her?
C: KIRK
D: No, I didn't think I had a chance.
C: STAINER
D: Exactly. So you were relaxed and funny. You were on.
N: Stainer posts several "Wheel in the Sky" flyers on a kiosk.
C: KIRK
D: So I gotta get back to that.
C: STAINER
D: That's just it, Kirky. Now that she's opened the door, you can't get back to that.
C: KIRK
D: So I'll have to fake it?
C: STAINER
D: Forget it. You can't fake that far. A broad like her - she'll smell that horseshit a mile away.
N: Kirk and Stainer enter a...
S: EXT. CAFE FRONT PATIO
N: ...and take a table on the crowded patio.
C: STAINER
D: Can we get a couple of menus? You eating?
E: then to Kirk
C: KIRK
D: Maybe just a salad.
C: STAINER
D: Dude, one salad ain't going make up for thirty years of chili dogs.
C: KIRK
D: I know. But I got dinner with my folks later.
C: STAINER
D: Fun. Be sure and stab your brother in the eye with a fork for me.
C: KIRK
D: Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight.
N: Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainer's table on their way to the valet stand. Stainer rolls his eyes.
C: KIRK
D: You know what - this is ridiculous. I'm just going to call her.
E: CONT'D
C: STAINER
D: Fuck you are! Put that thing away. You do not call her. Don't you get it? Talon is back in town.
C: KIRK
D: No, she broke up with him.
C: STAINER
D: So, you're telling me you were sitting there, a sweating, quivering stutter-bucket and when you came back from the can, Molly's hugging a guy who's so good looking you'd probably fuck him. What do you think she's doing this weekend?
C: KIRK
D: So what am I supposed to do?
C: STAINER
D: What can you do? She hasn't called - she's not going to.
C: KIRK
D: You're probably right.
C: STAINER
D: Just count yourself lucky. You got to kiss a goddess and you got out before she recalibrated your hardware. A chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you, nobody else measures up.
C: KIRK
D: No, you're right. You know what - it's good. It's better. I'm actually relieved. You should have seen this Talon guy. Man! All I've been thinking about is having to be naked in front of her. I don't need that kind of pressure.
N: The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his head as if to say, "Was there even a doubt?" Kirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings. Kirk and Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller ID.
C: STAINER
D: Don't do it!
N: The phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone. Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's wrist, pinning it to the table. RING!
C: KIRK
D: Cut it out!
C: STAINER
D: Let it go!
N: RING! Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around like battling snakes. Kirk presses the button to answer the call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone.
C: KIRK
D: Hello!?... Oh, no problem! Yeah I was super busy yesterday anyway.
C: STAINER
D: Would you look at yourself?
N: Stainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away.
C: KIRK
D: Well, I have dinner with my folks tonight... Oh, I wouldn't want to subject you to them... Okay. If you want to. I can pick you up...
N: Kirk gives a confident smile and an "I told you she'd call" nod. Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, sure. Well then let me call you back in a few minutes and I'll give you directions. Alrighty. Yeah. Buh-bye.
E: CONT'D
C: STAINER
D: Well, I guess you just solved that. An hour with your family and she'll file for a restraining order.
C: KIRK
D: No. Eric's not going to be there. It's going to be good. You might be wrong about Molly. She might...
N: Stainer spots a round little boy posting a "Lost Puppy" flyer over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk.
C: STAINER
D: Whoa! I don't think so Spanky! A little lower!
E: to the boy
N: The boy instead posts it over a "Walk For a Cure" poster.
S: EXT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
N: Molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a quaint residential street. She climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small sheet of paper. She sees Kirk sitting on the front porch.
C: KIRK
D: You found it!
C: MOLLY
D: I had good directions!
N: She steps up the front walk toward Kirk, who points to a little yellow note taped to the front door.
C: KIRK
D: I'm sorry. My folks aren't back yet. We're locked out.
C: MOLLY
D: You don't have a key?
C: KIRK
D: No. My dad's kind of obsessed with home-security. Like someone's going to break in and steal his Reader's Digest collection.
N: A very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a beagle on a leash. The man struggles a bit with the dog.
C: KIRK
D: Hi, Mr. Riley!
E: CONT'D
C: MR. RILEY
D: Well, howdy Kirk!
C: KIRK
D: Hey, what do say you take the night off and I'll take Noodle around the block for you? Are you up for a walk?
E: to Molly
C: MOLLY
D: That sounds great.
C: MR. RILEY
D: Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice.
N: Kirk jogs over to take the leash. Noodle jumps up on Kirk. He and Molly pet the excited dog.
C: KIRK
D: Yes! Always happy to see you, pretty girl! Yes you are a pretty girl! Yes you are!
E: baby talk
N: Molly takes note - animal lover - big points.
C: MR. RILEY
D: You're a good boy, Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: It's no trouble at all.
N: Molly and Kirk start down the sidewalk with Noodle. An old woman comes out of the next house with her dog on a leash.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Honey!? Are you back in business!?
C: KIRK
D: I had a little neighborhood dog- walking service when I was a kid . No problem, Mrs. D, we can take Norton along too!
E: To Molly to the woman
N: Several soft-faded cuts as Kirk and Molly move through the neighborhood. Soon they have a third dog. Kirk points out landmarks as they talk and laugh. Now they have a fourth dog. Molly takes his arm. The evening light is a bit dimmer as they give Noodle back to Mr. Riley. Kirk turns toward his parents' house. Now there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked-up, knobby- tired pick-up parked out front. The truck has two bumper stickers ("One Nation Under GOD!" and "No Fat Chicks!") flanking a vanity license plate that reads, "ERIX-TOY." Kirk's shoulders slump at the sight of it.
C: KIRK
D: Hey, you know what I'm thinking, let's go get Chinese.
E: CONT'D
C: MOLLY
D: What are you talking about? I want to meet your family.
N: They start toward the door. Molly's cell phone rings.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm so sorry. It's Patty. I've got to take this. Go ahead. I'll be right in.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
N: Kirk comes through the front door to find his father in the living room watching a hockey game.
C: KIRK
D: Hey dad.
C: MR. KETTNER
D: Kirk.
E: without looking up
C: MRS. KETTNER
D: Hi sweetie!
E: O.S.
N: Eric steps out of the kitchen with three beers.
C: ERIC
D: Close the door, fucknut.
C: KIRK
D: Hey Eric. I thought you were hanging drywall tonight.
C: ERIC
D: Nah. Fuckin' Leroy fired me again. Like that dick never came to work with a little buzz on.
C: KIRK
D: Okay, listen, I brought a date tonight. I really like her. Please don't embarrass me in front of her. I'll do anything you want.
C: ERIC
D: I promise I won't mention her goiter.
N: Eric and Dad crack up. A flushing sound and then Ron comes out of the bathroom. He's buckling up. Kirk's shoulders drop again.
C: RON
D: I did like you said Mr. K.
N: Eric tosses Ron and Mr. Kettner each a beer.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, hey Ron. So Marnie's here?
N: Marnie appears in the door of the kitchen. She's holding a corningware pot filled with mashed potatoes. Molly finishes her call. She's up the front steps and Kirk lets her in. Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner are stunned. Marnie drops the pot and it smashes on the floor in front of her. Mrs. Kettner and Debbie rush out to see what Marnie is gaping at. Debbie (still pregnant) is immediately threatened by the way Eric is looking at Molly.
C: KIRK
D: Everyone, this is Molly McCall.
E: CONT'D
N: Kirk's never seen his family so impressed. He can't hide his grin. Ron pops the cap off his beer and it overflows a bit.
S: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Kirk, Molly, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Marnie, Ron and Debbie sit around the kitchen table and feast on a meatloaf dinner. Eric is at the fridge grabbing a beer. Marnie is angrily watching Ron whose eyes are all over Molly.
C: ERIC
D: You want another one Dad?
C: MR. KETTNER
D: You read my mind.
C: MRS. KETTNER
D: You two take it easy now. We have guests. Eric honey, I'm sure if you apologize to Leroy, he'll take you back.
E: THEN
N: Eric returns to the table with the beers.
C: ERIC
D: Nah, fuck him. Anyways, Leroy ain't payin' shit ever since he trucked in all those spics from Fresno.
C: KIRK
D: Geeze Eric!
N: Ron looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that...
C: RON
D: I got this, Kirk. Eric, before you go bad-mouthin' a whole group of people, you should know that my grandmother on my father's side is from Fresno.
C: ERIC
D: Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know. So, Molly. What do you do?
E: THEN
C: MOLLY
D: I'm an event planner.
C: ERIC
D: You see? That's using your head. That's a business to get into.
C: MOLLY
D: Well, thank you Eric.
C: ERIC
D: Book a band, blow up a few balloons and people pay out the ass for it.
C: KIRK
D: There's a little more to it than that, Eric. Molly handles some big events. She's even doing a benefit with Billy Joel next month.
C: MOLLY
D: Actually, Eric's right. Just a few balloons.
E: PLAYFULLY
N: Molly smiles to reassure Kirk that she can handle herself.
C: RON
D: You know, Molly, I'm a business owner myself. A little restaurant.
C: MARNIE
D: I wouldn't really call it a restaurant, Ron.
C: RON
D: We serve food that people eat. So - restaurant.
C: MARNIE
D: It's a Pizza Hut with no tables. It's a take out place.
C: ERIC
D: So, Molly, me and Debbie here are getting hitched. What do you get for a wedding job?
N: Kirk raises his eyebrows into "please-behave-yourself" puppy dog eyes. Eric shoots back an "oh whatever" sneer.
C: MOLLY
D: Hmmm. Honestly, I don't really do a lot of weddings. I specialize more in fund-raisers, corporate events, that kind of thing.
E: MORE
C: MOLLY
D: Right now I'm working on the annual benefit for the Children's Cancer Center.
E: CONT'D
C: ERIC
D: But you've done weddings.
C: MOLLY
D: I've done a few.
C: ERIC
D: So, what do you get for one?
C: KIRK
D: Dad, could you...
C: DEBBIE
D: Don't get your panties in a wad, Kirk. He's just making conversation.
C: MOLLY
D: Geeze, there are so many factors that affect the cost of a wedding.
C: ERIC
D: We're looking at about two hundred people and we're gonna do this whole Nascar theme.
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm getting a kick-ass dress made out of actual checkered flags and Eric is going to be in an orange tux with a big Home Depot logo on the back and Tony Stewart's number 20 on the shoulders.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, how fun!
C: ERIC
D: So what's the damage for supervising something like that?
C: KIRK
D: Eric, please.
C: ERIC
D: I'm just talkin' ballpark. I'm ain't gonna try and Jew her down.
C: MOLLY
D: Okay. Before expenses, my base fee for a non-charity event is fifteen thousand. So, I'd ballpark that somewhere around twenty-five grand.
C: ERIC
D: Fuck a duck.
E: STUNNED
N: For a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the conversation. Kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter.
C: ERIC
D: So you're making a comfortable living, you seem like you got your head together more or less and Christ, look at ya. What the hell you doing with numbnuts here?
E: CONT'D
C: MRS. KETTNER
D: Eric!
C: ERIC
D: Come on, Ma - we're all thinking it.
C: MRS. KETTNER
D: Molly, I'm so sorry.
C: MOLLY
D: No, it's fine. The truth is, Kirk and I are just getting to know one another but so far, I think he's decent, he's funny and... You know, when we first met, Kirk asked me in all sincerity if I knew how to do an oil change.
N: Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner each let out a quick burst of "yeah right" laughter.
C: MOLLY
D: I know! And, you're right, I don't but... I just love that he asked.
E: CONT'D
N: A moment passes as they all process this. The women at the table all know exactly what Molly means. The men are simply confused.
C: ERIC
D: Funny? Kirk is funny? Tell us a joke there Sinbad.
C: MRS. KETTNER
D: Well I hope you can hold onto this one pumpkin. When Marnie broke up with him he was devastated for months, the poor little guy.
E: to Kirk to Molly
N: Marnie looks up, surprised and touched by the comment. Kirk is mortified.
C: ERIC
D: No shit, when you dump him, he's liable to kill himself.
N: Kirk rubs his own head to keep it from exploding. Molly calms him with a hand on his back. This move isn't lost on Marnie.
S: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BATHROOM - LATER
N: Kirk splashes water on his face and then looks for a towel but can't find one. He's forced to use his sleeve. He is a wreck. He takes a deep breath and steps out into...
S: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME ENTRY HALL
N: ...to find Marnie at the front door putting her coat on.
C: KIRK
D: Are you heading home?
C: MARNIE
D: Got to get home and let Peanut out. Kirk, you look really good.
E: she wipes some lint off of Kirk's shirt sleeve.
C: KIRK
D: Thanks. You do too.
N: Marnie smiles a sad smile.
C: MARNIE
D: Ron! Let's go!
C: RON
D: I'm coming! It was really fantastic to meet you Molly. If you ever need a pizza...
N: Ron gives Molly a hug that makes Marnie as uncomfortable as it does Molly. He then passes Kirk as he crosses to the front door, carrying a pile of foiled over paper plates.
C: RON
D: Cripes Kirk! Crack a window in there pirate! HAHAHA!
E: CONT'D
N: Ron and Marnie exit. Kirk walks back into...
S: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN
N: Mrs. Kettner and Molly are cleaning up.
C: KIRK
D: Molly, you don't have to do that.
C: MOLLY
D: No, It's fine.
C: MRS. KETTNER
D: You let us have some girl time. Take these downstairs to your dad.
N: She hands Kirk a bag of Fritos and shoes him through the basement door.
S: INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: Kirk's father has built a tacky little basement bar decorated with neon beer signs and Eric's old trophies and ribbons. Mr. Kettner and Debbie sit at the bar and smoke as Eric stands behind the bar and serves them cocktails. Kirk comes down the basement stairs and joins them. The hockey game wrap-up highlights are running on a TV mounted above the bar.
C: KIRK
D: So, what was the final score?
C: ERIC
D: You think you're hot shit now? Is that it?
C: KIRK
D: Look, Eric, you've had a lot to drink tonight and...
C: DEBBIE
D: Don't tell him what to do. You're doing fine, baby.
E: to Eric
C: ERIC
D: You think you're better than me. Say it. Well take a look around, Big Slick. Every one of these says Eric. First place! First Place! M.V.P.!
E: re: trophies MORE
C: ERIC
D: Winner! Winner! You think you're the winner now? Well forget it, man! I don't buy this for a second.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Well, it's been fun.
E: STANDING
C: MR. KETTNER
D: Now don't be that way, boy. All your big brother is trying to say is that we're worried about you.
C: ERIC
D: You show up here with that piece of ass!? Either you're fucking with us or she's fucking with you so which is it?
C: KIRK
D: Look, I know she's a little out of my league but...
C: ERIC
D: A little!? Are you shitting me? Alright, alright! I think we can all agree that Debbie here is one wicked hot box.
N: Debbie smiles and squeezes Eric's hand. Mr. Kettner nods and raises his glass.
C: KIRK
D: She's um... very attractive.
C: ERIC
D: Yeah, and this Molly makes her look like a pig.
N: Debbie lets go of Eric's hand and storms upstairs.
C: ERIC
D: You see? This girl of yours is already startin' shit. Come on baby! Kirk didn't mean nothing by that!
E: CONT'D Calling after Debbie
C: KIRK
D: Look, I don't know what's going on either but...
C: ERIC
D: I'm goin' upstairs and gettin' to the bottom of this.
C: KIRK
D: Eric! No!
C: ERIC
D: I think this gal is messing with my little brother and I'm not going to sit still for it.
C: KIRK
D: Eric! Okay! I know! I'm sure she's just slumming or something and it's all going to be over any minute but, Jesus Christ! She'll come to her senses without any help from you! She's up there with...
N: Kirk turns to point up the stairs. As he glances back, he finds Molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down at him. Before Kirk can get a word out, Molly storms out of the house. Kirk runs upstairs but she's in her car before he can get out the front door. Eric appears behind him.
C: ERIC
D: Way to go numbnuts. You should have let me handle it.
S: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
N: Kirk stands at work, searching Habib's bag and looking grouchy. Fuller monitors Kirk, arms crossed. Habib lets out a long irritated sigh.
C: KIRK
D: I know. I'm sorry, man.
N: Kirk hands the bag back to Habib and sends him on his way. Randy, another agent, hands Kirk a note. INSERT: The note reads, "Kirk, We need to talk. I'm in the food court. -M." Kirk sighs. Stainer is now reading over Kirk's shoulder.
C: STAINER
D: Well, I guess this is it. I'm surprised she even bothered.
S: INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT
N: The food court is crowded. Kirk looks around for Molly but does not see her.
C: MARNIE
D: Good, you got my note.
E: O.S.
N: Kirk turns to find Marnie sitting at a table working on a Burrito Supreme.
C: KIRK
D: Oh. Yeah. Hi.
C: MARNIE
D: I'm sorry to bug you at work but this couldn't wait.
N: Kirk sits down.
C: MARNIE
D: Kirk, I think I messed up. I see a change in you and I like it. So, I was thinking that we should maybe... get back together. Just to try it out, you know?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Wow. I don't know, Marnie.
C: MARNIE
D: Why not? Please don't say it's because of this Molly person.
C: KIRK
D: No, I think I already screwed that up anyway.
C: MARNIE
D: Good. I was really worried about you with her. She seems like kind of a bitch.
C: KIRK
D: What? She is not.
C: MARNIE
D: Well, she acts like she's better than everyone with her hybrid car and her la-de-da charity work.
C: KIRK
D: She doesn't do that at all, Marnie. You're just putting that on her.
C: MARNIE
D: Okay, maybe so. See? This is what I mean. You never argued with me before. You're really growing.
C: KIRK
D: What about Ron?
C: MARNIE
D: If you want to get back together, of course, I'll break up with Ron.
C: KIRK
D: You mean you're still with him?
C: MARNIE
D: I'm not going to risk being all alone just because you don't know what's good for you. Come on, Kirk. Deep down, you know where you belong.
C: KIRK
D: You're right, I think I do. Say hi to Ron for me.
N: Kirk stands and walks away.
S: EXT. AIR SHOW ENTRANCE - DAY
N: Kirk and Stainer are at the ticket gate. Kirk pays for his ticket but Stainer stands staring at him.
C: KIRK
D: What?
C: STAINER
D: This wasn't my idea. I ain't dropping twenty bucks to go in there. God-damned planes are in the sky. I can see 'em just fine from the parking lot for free.
N: Kirk begrudgingly buys Stainer a ticket.
S: EXT. AIR SHOW
N: Kirk and Stainer move through the crowd. Stainer now carries a corn dog, a giant soda and an armload of Air Show memorabilia, including an inflatable F/A-18 Hornet.
C: KIRK
D: She's working one of the kids' charities. I'm guessing they might be down by the rides.
C: STAINER
D: Whoa dude, check it out. The Blue Angels!
N: Five men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through the crowd in slow motion. They exude masculine confidence.
C: STAINER
D: Those are the coolest guys in the entire world. Think about it - George Clooney or Derek Jeter would trade places with those guys in a second. Can you imagine the sheer magnitude of puss those fuckers tag? I'm gonna get 'em to sign my Hornet!
E: CONT'D
N: Stainer runs toward them. He joins some kids and beautiful women who are already getting autographs. Kirk spots Molly working a charity booth. He crosses to her. She turns to him with a this-better-be-good stance.
C: KIRK
D: Molly.
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: I just wanted to apologize for last night... for my family.
C: MOLLY
D: Your family I can deal with.
C: KIRK
D: And for me... For what I said.
C: MOLLY
D: Do you really think I'm that shallow? You think I need to slum?
C: KIRK
D: No. I don't know what to think. You just have to understand that this is a new area for me. Believe it or not, I don't have gobs of experience with beautiful women.
C: MOLLY
D: Is that all I am to you?
C: KIRK
D: No, but I don't have much experience with brilliant, successful, wonderful women either.
N: This melts Molly a bit.
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk, this can't work if you put me up on some kind of pedestal.
C: KIRK
D: It's not that I... Okay, look... When I was a kid, we played a lot of baseball in my neighborhood. The worst part was picking teams because I was always picked last. Every time. Like they couldn't start a friggin' game without first establishing how much I sucked. So, now you come along and make me feel like the first pick. But... what if I can't hit?
N: Molly softens and smiles.
C: MOLLY
D: You already got to first base. Just keep your eye on the ball.
N: Kirk nods and smiles back. Molly steals a quick kiss.
C: MOLLY
D: Let me tie up a couple things and I'll show you around the grounds.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Sounds good.
N: Molly goes into a tent to speak to Patty. Kirk watches her with a calm, relieved smile.
C: VOICE
D: Boy, she sure is something, huh?
E: O.S.
N: Kirk turns toward the imposing Blue Angel pilot standing behind him. The pilot removes his shades - it's Talon.
C: TALON
D: It's Kirk right? Excellent to see you again, sir.
E: firm handshake
C: KIRK
D: Oh, Talon. You're a Blue Angel?
C: TALON
D: Yes sir, a Naval Aviator.
C: KIRK
D: Perfect. Okay, I get it - Talon is what - your call-sign?
C: TALON
D: No, it's my name.
C: KIRK
D: Then what's your call-sign?
C: TALON
D: Oh, I'd rather not say. It's embarrassing. Just something the guys gave me...
N: Talon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the booth.
C: TALON
D: Anyway listen Kirk, is it fair to say that you and Mol are close?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, I guess.
C: TALON
D: Well, I understand that fellas like yourself tend to have uniquely candid relationships with the women they befriend. Am I right?
C: KIRK
D: Fellas like myself?
C: TALON
D: Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with your lifestyle. What grown men do in the privacy of their homes is none of my concern.
C: KIRK
D: Talon, I'm not...
C: TALON
D: Hey, I'm in the Navy. I don't ask and I don't expect you to tell.
N: Talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone.
C: TALON
D: Now, I don't know what Molly's told you about me, but anything bad - I deserve. I hurt that girl. I hurt one of God's own angels and I've regretted it every minute since.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: No. She speaks very highly...
C: TALON
D: God as my witness, I WILL make it right. I WILL get her back. Can I count on you to put in the good word for me, Poncho?
C: KIRK
D: Um... Sure.
C: TALON
D: You're the man. Come here.
N: Talon embraces Kirk in a tight hug.
C: TALON
D: There you go. Feel the tolerance.
E: CONT'D
N: Another Blue Angel calls over while signing Stainer's plane. BLUE ANGEL #2 Yo! Foot-Long! We scramble in ten.
C: TALON
D: Roger!
N: Talon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: That was Talon.
C: STAINER
D: Who? The Blue Angel guy? Duuuuude!
E: cracking up
N: Molly joins them. MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE: 1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd. Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell out "MOLLY" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.) 2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look. The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is oblivious to this exchange. 3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up, he is tackled by two cops.
C: COP
D: Nice try pervert!
N: Molly spins around, horrified.
C: COP
D: It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of shit was following you but we got him.
E: CONT'D
N: Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the cop's grasp. 4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.
T: FADE MUSIC
S: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant. The place is decorated with balloons and streamers. A huge banner reads, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE!"
C: STAINER
D: Seriously, what's with the banner? She's blind, right? Seems like they could have saved a few bucks there.
N: Patty runs in.
C: PATTY
D: Here they come! Everybody hide!
C: STAINER
D: Is that really necessary?
C: KIRK
D: Stainer! Just hide.
N: They hide. Molly leads her sister, KATIE, into the restaurant. "Surprise!" Molly hugs Katie.
C: KIRK
D: Still think she's Al Qaeda?
E: CONT'D to Stainer
N: Stainer brushes off the comment. Molly waves Kirk over.
C: MOLLY
D: Katie, I'd like you to meet Kirk.
C: KATIE
D: It's so nice to meet you, I've heard great things.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, thank you. Molly raves about her big sister non-stop.
C: KATIE
D: May I?
N: Katie reaches out to feel Kirk's face. She's a bit perplexed by the result. Two blind teenaged boys approach.
C: BLIND TEEN
D: Mrs. McCall?
C: KATIE
D: Robert! Is Jerry with you?
C: JERRY
D: Yes, ma'am. Happy Birthday.
C: KATIE
D: It's so nice you came. These are two of my star pupils, Robert and Jerry. Boys, this is my sister, Molly.
E: to Molly
C: JERRY
D: It's nice to meet you.
N: They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one another like a couple of horny construction workers. A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but uncopyrighted birthday song. Katie blows out her candles.
C: MOLLY
D: What's your wish, Katie?
C: KATIE
D: I wish Kirk would play the piano for me.
N: Kirk's face drops. Molly kisses her sister on the forehead as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the piano bench. Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.
C: KIRK
D: Really. I can barely play.
C: KATIE
D: Come on, Kirk! For my birthday?
N: Kirk is sweating. He reaches for the keys but he is now white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around, hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though he might vomit. Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly, a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends. Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off. Talon appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.
C: TALON
D: It's okay Kirk. You'll rock us next time right chief?
C: KIRK
D: Oh, hey Talon. Thanks.
C: TALON
D: I'm glad you're here. I feel terrible about our little misunderstanding. I don't know what had me thinking you were a gay fella. Molly tells me you two have been seeing each other.
N: Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look.
C: TALON
D: She's got every right. I'd hate me too. I want to congratulate you, Poncho. You're the better man. Now, I'll step aside and truly wish you the best of luck. I wouldn't wish losing that girl on my worst foe. But, make no mistake, you blow it and I'll be waiting in wings. Love and war, right chief?
E: CONT'D THEN
N: Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute. Kirk holds his forced confidence until Talon departs. Once alone, Kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair. The party goes on and Katie opens a small present.
C: MOLLY
D: Oh, it's a DVD.
C: KATIE
D: Who's this from?
N: Nobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer.
C: STAINER
D: What? It's closed captioned.
N: Patty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass to them. Patty gives Talon the finger.
C: KIRK
D: What did he do?
C: PATTY
D: Listen, Molly would kill me if she knew I was telling you this but I'm trying to do you a favor.
C: KIRK
D: Okay.
C: PATTY
D: Molly has this physical...um issue. You know, kind of like a birth defect?
C: KIRK
D: Oh, my God.
C: PATTY
D: It's not a big deal but she's really self-conscious about it. Talon and some other guys she's dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak.
C: KIRK
D: What is it?
C: PATTY
D: It's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again.
C: KIRK
D: No, no. I wouldn't do that.
C: PATTY
D: Good. 'Cause if you do, it'll be your last conscious act... Cake?
E: she stands
N: Patty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses the room and walks out to the...
S: EXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK
N: He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance similar to the one he had done after their first kiss. Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys come around the front to join Kirk.
C: STAINER
D: Dude?
C: KIRK
D: My friends! Whassup Bitches!
E: playfully chipper
C: DEVON
D: What? What's going on?
C: KIRK
D: My troubles are over boys! It's all going to work out! Check it out - Molly has... Wait for it...
N: Kirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up.
C: KIRK
D: ...a birth defect!
E: CONT'D
C: DEVON
D: Excuse me?
C: JACK
D: That's terrible.
C: KIRK
D: No. That's awesome! Don't you get it?
C: DEVON
D: Ahhhh No.
C: STAINER
D: Sure, I get it. She needs a good guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she dates can't handle it, right?
C: KIRK
D: It sent Talon packing.
N: Kirk and Stainer high five. Jack and Devon look disturbed.
C: DEVON
D: Well, what's wrong with her?
C: KIRK
D: I don't know yet. Patty just said she had a physical issue.
C: DEVON
D: Well that could be anything. Did she say it was a birth defect?
C: KIRK
D: She said it was, "something like a birth defect."
C: JACK
D: What if it's something really bad?
C: KIRK
D: I hope it is. I hope it's something that would make most guys run screaming. It won't matter to me. I love her.
C: JACK
D: That's cool that you love her but it's pretty fucked up to be rooting for a harsh deformity.
C: DEVON
D: Oh, wow. What if this is Patty's way of telling you that Molly is a man?
C: STAINER
D: Hey, if that chick has a dick, I'll suck it!
S: INT. RESTAURANT - LATER
N: Kirk and Molly are cleaning up after the party. Kirk is relaxed and in a fantastic mood. Patty gets her coat and hugs Molly before exiting. Molly sheepishly approaches Kirk.
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk, I'm so sorry about the piano thing. It was stupid of me.
C: KIRK
D: No. I know what you were trying to do. It's okay. I wish I could have played for her but...
C: MOLLY
D: Well, anyway, thanks for all your help with Katie's party. I know it meant a lot to her.
N: Molly kisses Kirk. Now he's calm and kisses her back passionately. She smiles a naughty smile at him.
C: MOLLY
D: Tonight?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Tonight.
N: They start cleaning up as fast as they can. Kirk is beaming!
S: INT. MOLLY'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: MONTAGE OVER LOVE SONG: Kirk and Molly enter her modern, luxurious condo. Kirk takes her coat. They kiss. Kirk opens a bottle of wine. He pours one glass to share. They sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on! He is confident and silly and Molly is eating it up. They are making out passionately on the couch. Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at it as if to say, "How 'bout them apples!?" Molly laughs and leads him into the bedroom. Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out. Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this. He decides to sit. Molly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and slippers. She looks perfect. She crosses to the bed and sits down next to Kirk. They kiss but Molly stops. MUSIC REDUCED TO BACKGROUND
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk, before we do this, there's something I'm really insecure about and you're going to see it sooner or later so...
C: KIRK
D: Hey, take a look at me.
N: Molly smiles nervously. She stands in front of him, Crying Game style. She removes her feet from her slippers and looks down at them. Kirk looks down. Even her feet are fantastic.
C: KIRK
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: MOLLY
D: Don't rush me... Okay, look.
N: She parts her toes. They are webbed. Kirk's face drops.
C: KIRK
D: That's it?
N: Kirk jumps up and paces around.
C: KIRK
D: That's it? That's the best you can do? This is your big flaw?
E: CONT'D
C: MOLLY
D: If you can't handle it...
C: KIRK
D: Jesus Christ! I can't! I thought you were going to show me some kind of hairy growth or a third nipple or something I could work with!
C: MOLLY
D: What the hell is wrong with you!?
C: KIRK
D: You know what's wrong with me!? I'll tell you! I'm fat! I'm bald! I'm ugly! I'm hairy! I'm uncoordinated! I'm uncreative! I'm not a college graduate! I've never been to Europe! I have a shitty job! I drive a shitty car! You want me to go on!? Because I can!
C: MOLLY
D: No.
C: KIRK
D: So, here I think that the perfect Molly McCall is finally going to show me a good reason why she's messing around with the likes of me! And this is all you got!? You can't wear friggin' flip-flops!?
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk, I've given you plenty of good reasons.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, yeah! I'm nice! I'm funny! I ask cute, stupid questions! Right! That doesn't get a three hooked up with a ten! Not in this world!
C: MOLLY
D: A three what? What are you talking about!?
C: KIRK
D: Look! What the hell is going on here!? What are you up to!?
C: MOLLY
D: What am I up to!? Good God!
C: KIRK
D: Please, tell me you're a terrorist! Tell me you're on a scavenger hunt! Just tell me something that makes sense because all you're doing is driving me nuts!
C: MOLLY
D: The only thing I'm going to tell you is that I'd like you to leave.
E: hurt and resigned
C: KIRK
D: Fine! I'm going! Webbed feet!? Are you fucking kidding me!?
N: Kirk grabs his coat and heads out the door. Molly slumps onto her bed and cries as the door slams.
S: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
N: Kirk is at his post looking terribly sad. Stainer is working at the same lane and is obviously feeling bad for his friend. Fuller taps Kirk on the shoulder to alert him that Habib is coming through. Habib sees this and takes his bag straight to the search table, where he opens it for Kirk. Kirk doesn't look inside.
C: KIRK
D: Go on, Habib. You're good.
C: HABIB
D: Really!? Great!
N: Habib steps off to his gate. Fuller gets in Kirk's face.
C: FULLER
D: You think you're pretty smart don't you Kettner. Thin ice mister!
N: Kirk stomps away from the checkpoint.
C: FULLER
D: Good! Don't come back, Kettner! America is safer without you!
E: CONT'D
N: Stainer goes after Kirk.
S: EXT. AIRPORT CURB
N: Kirk walks out the doors. Stainer catches up to him and they walk down the busy curb at a quick, angry pace.
C: STAINER
D: Kirky! Hold up, man! What are you doing!? You can't let her screw up your life!
C: KIRK
D: Get away from me Stainer!
C: STAINER
D: Whoa! Don't take it out on me! We both knew this Molly thing wasn't going to work out! It ain't my fault!
C: KIRK
D: You're right. It's not your fault. It's my fault for listening to all your... pernicious advice.
C: STAINER
D: What the fuck you talkin' about?
C: KIRK
D: All you did was fill my head with all this crap about threes and tens and how I'm not worthy.
C: STAINER
D: Are you worthy of a chick like that?
C: KIRK
D: Maybe! I don't know. But that's not the point! You're supposed to be my God damned best friend. You know what!?
E: MORE
C: KIRK
D: I think you were jealous and you set out to sabotage us from the start!
E: CONT'D
C: STAINER
D: That is total bullshit!
C: KIRK
D: Then why weren't you there for me? What if she actually liked me!? Maybe with a little help, I could have pulled it off!
N: Kirk steps onto an...
S: INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
N: Willy (the Russian) is behind the wheel and as happy as ever. A few others are seated on the bus. Stainer follows Kirk on board. They remain standing, holding onto poles.
C: WILLY
D: It is Kirk and his crazy friend Stinker and they are most upset!
N: Willy steps on it and drives like a maniac, knocking Kirk and Stainer around as they argue.
C: STAINER
D: Kirk, she was going to hurt you.
C: KIRK
D: Look at me! I'm hurt now!
N: Willy occasionally blurts out mindless echoes of their argument, which Kirk and Stainer mostly ignore, like...
C: WILLY
D: He's hurting now!
C: STAINER
D: The longer this went on the worse it would have been. I guarantee it!
C: KIRK
D: You don't know what you're talking about.
C: WILLY
D: He does not know!
C: STAINER
D: Yes, I do, Kirk! I know exactly what I'm talking about.
C: WILLY
D: Perhaps he does know after all!
C: STAINER
D: Remember last year when you hardly saw me for about two months? I met my own perfect ten. Tina Jordan. Smart, cool and hot like you wouldn't believe. Hotter than Molly even.
C: KIRK
D: Yeah right. So how come I never heard a word about her until now?
C: WILLY
D: Yes, how come no word of this Tina!?
C: STAINER
D: I didn't tell anyone. I didn't want to jinx it. She was perfect. I was spilling over with...with fucking happy! You know?
C: WILLY
D: Fucking happy!
C: STAINER
D: Two months into it, she dumps me. And I knew it was coming. A girl like that. Sooner or later she was bound to get a better offer. But it kicked my ass, man. I was depressed for months.
C: KIRK
D: That's what that was? You said you had that fatigue syndrome thing.
C: STAINER
D: I didn't want everyone knowing what a pussy I was. Dude, it was a hurt I can't even put into words.
C: WILLY
D: What a pussy.
C: STAINER
D: I couldn't watch you go through that 'cause I love you, man. You're the brother I never had.
N: Stainer leans over and hugs Kirk. Kirk doesn't hug back.
C: KIRK
D: You have a brother, Stainer.
C: STAINER
D: Yeah, but he's a cheese-dick.
N: Kirk's phone rings. He answers, forcing Stainer to let go.
C: KIRK
D: Hello?
S: INT. LAW OFFICE
N: Maury sits at his desk.
C: MAURY
D: Kirk? Geeze, I'm glad I caught you. Listen son, I got something to tell you and don't get mad at me okay? 'Cause this thing ain't my fault. You might want to sit down for this.
S: INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
N: Kirk slumps into a seat and listens, looking upset and shocked. Stainer stares at Kirk, trying to get a sense of what Kirk is being told.
C: STAINER
D: What!?
S: INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Patty sits behind a reception desk in a small but stylish lobby. A sign above her desk reads, "McCall Events." Kirk walks in. Patty puts down her work and stares back at him.
C: KIRK
D: Is Molly in?
C: PATTY
D: You got some big red apples showing your face around here again.
C: KIRK
D: I know. I'm sorry. I just... Is she here?
C: PATTY
D: No. Get lost.
N: Stainer bursts in sweating and panting.
C: PATTY
D: Oh, for Christ sake! This one too!?
E: CONT'D
N: Patty comes out from behind her desk.
C: PATTY
D: I'm warning you both - Molly has been through enough. You go near her and I will fuck you all the way up! Understand!?
E: CONT'D
N: Stainer swaggers up into Patty's face.
C: STAINER
D: Listen, bitch...
N: WHACK!!! Patty throws an elbow and Stainer's head jacks back. She is instantly on him, grabbing him in a headlock and punching him in the face.
C: STAINER
D: Ahhh!! Jesus Christ!!! Kirk!!
E: CONT'D
C: PATTY
D: Who's your Mommy!? Come on! Who's your Mommy!?
C: STAINER
D: You are!
C: PATTY
D: That's right! Patty is, isn't she!
C: KIRK
D: Patty! Cut it out! I just came to tell her that something happened! Something really major happened!
N: Patty stops punching and looks up curiously. Stainer remains in the headlock - also curious.
C: STAINER
D: What happened?
N: Patty punches him again.
C: PATTY
D: You shut your hole! What happened?
E: to Kirk
C: KIRK
D: First off, I'm sorry. Okay?
N: Patty rams Stainer's head into the door.
C: PATTY
D: Every time you say you're sorry, dumbshit here gets his bell rung.
C: KIRK
D: Okay, okay! Sorry! I just...
N: Patty slams him again.
C: STAINER
D: Dude! Stop apologizing!
C: KIRK
D: Look! I know I was acting like an idiot. She's just so... Well, I was really having a hard time with everyone thinking I was Molly's brother or her co-worker or her gay friend or whatever. I mean, nobody believed that we were together.
C: PATTY
D: It's too late for this shit, Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: But I've got it worked out now.
N: Patty and Stainer wait for it. Kirk decides how to phrase it.
C: KIRK
D: My Grandmother left me three million dollars.
E: CONT'D
C: STAINER
D: Seriously?
N: Patty drops Stainer on the floor.
C: PATTY
D: I thought she was a blackjack dealer.
C: KIRK
D: It turns out she bought stock in Caesars Palace back in the sixties. Nobody knew she still had it. I don't think she even knew.
C: PATTY
D: Wow. So, what does this have to do with Molly?
C: KIRK
D: See? Now it makes sense - me with her. I'm a millionaire now.
C: PATTY
D: So, what, now you can afford her!?
C: STAINER
D: No! No! I get it! It's not a whore thing! Now it works out in his own mind. Right!? He can relax and stop acting like a freak because now he's bringing something to the table! Right, Kirky!?
C: KIRK
D: Right. Well, no. Now that you say it out loud... I don't know.
C: PATTY
D: You know what, Kirk - I told Molly you were different but you're just as shallow and full of shit as the rest of them, aren't you?
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, maybe I am.
N: Kirk walks out.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
N: Stainer is at his post watching the luggage on the x-ray monitor. Suddenly, he sees Kirk coming through followed by Marnie, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Eric and Debbie (still pregnant). They are all wearing bright yellow sweatshirts. Stainer runs around the machine to hug Kirk, who looks a little numb.
C: STAINER
D: Kirky! How you been, brother!? What are you doing here?
C: KIRK
D: Me and Marnie and the family are going to Branson. You know.
C: STAINER
D: So you're "Branson Bound."
N: Stainer is referring to Kirk's shirt that reads, "BRANSON BOUND" in big letters.
C: KIRK
D: These were Marnie's idea. To make it easy for us to stick together.
E: EMBARRASSED
N: The others come through. Their shirts are decorated likewise.
C: MARNIE
D: Come on, Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: I gotta go.
N: Stainer takes the boarding pass from Kirk's hand.
C: STAINER
D: Relax, your flight doesn't leave for another forty five minutes.
C: KIRK
D: I'll meet you guys down at the gate, alright?
E: to Marnie
N: Marnie isn't pleased but she's going along with it. Eric calls back as they all head to the gate.
C: ERIC
D: Hey Stainer! Long time no see! Take care, bro!
C: STAINER
D: Why is he so nice all of a sudden?
C: KIRK
D: Probably because I'm getting three million dollars next week.
C: STAINER
D: Shit, that's right. So you're back with Marnie then, huh?
E: THEN
C: KIRK
D: Yeah, I know, but it's for the best. I'm more secure with her. I'm actually happy to be done with all that Molly craziness.
N: Ron comes through security and over to Kirk.
C: RON
D: Hey Stainer. Hey Pirate, can you spot me a twenty. I want to get me one of them travel pillows.
N: Kirk gives Ron a twenty and Ron steps away. Stainer is appalled. He calls after Ron.
C: STAINER
D: How come I'm not a pirate!? Dude, do not tell me that he's going with you guys.
E: then to Kirk
C: KIRK
D: He already bought his ticket and my dad likes him. It's no big deal.
C: STAINER
D: Look at me Big Slick.
N: Kirk doesn't look into his eyes.
C: KIRK
D: What?
C: STAINER
D: Look at me.
N: Kirk looks.
C: STAINER
D: Tell me things are good.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Don't be such a drama queen. Things are fine. I gotta go.
C: STAINER
D: Alright, man. It was good to see you, Kirk.
N: They exchange an awkward handshake. Kirk walks away. Stainer stands alone, watching him go. Stainer tightens his jaw and runs his fingers through his hair. Finally he kicks his head back and, with great determination, he stomps off in the opposite direction. Follow Stainer past security, dodging passengers and carts. He arrives at the...
S: INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT
N: Stainer marches up to the Orange Julius. A short, doughy, plain girl works the counter. (This is the same girl that Stainer had claimed to have "boned" earlier.) She's wearing an orange visor and rubber gloves. Several customers are waiting but Stainer moves to stand in front of her. She looks up from her smoothie. She has drink powder on her face. She groans to see him.
C: TINA
D: Elmer, I've got customers here.
C: STAINER
D: Tina, I need to know right now why it didn't work out with us.
N: She hands a smoothie to a customer.
C: TINA
D: That's a large Julius. Twelve fifty.
C: STAINER
D: This is important. I was good to you. I was sensitive, right?
C: MALE CUSTOMER
D: Hey, Desperado, you gonna order something or what?
N: Stainer gets in the customer's face.
C: STAINER
D: The fuck you just call me!?
C: TINA
D: Oh, for Christ's! Tammy! Can you cover me!?
S: INT. AIRPORT - SOUTHWEST GATE
N: A large crowd of passengers are waiting to board. The gate agent, makes an announcement.
C: GATE AGENT
D: Okay folks, we're going to start by boarding the A group. All A's are now welcome to board.
N: Marnie butts into the line.
C: MARNIE
D: Look, I've got seven people in my party so we're going to need to board right away.
E: SNOTTY
C: GATE AGENT
D: Are you folks in the A group?
C: MARNIE
D: What difference does that make!?
C: GATE AGENT
D: Well, because you seem like a little bit of a B. May I see your boarding pass?
C: MARNIE
D: Fine. We're not in the A group but we're still getting on next.
N: She hands him the pass - marked "C."
C: GATE AGENT
D: Oh, it looks like you're a raging C. So, you're gonna want to take a seat until your group is called.
N: She stomps away.
S: INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT - LATER
N: Stainer and Tina sit at a table. He sits with his head down like a sad little boy. She pities him.
C: TINA
D: I really liked you Elmer, but all that stuff about me being a ten and how lucky you were and always checking up to see if I was going to dump you...
C: STAINER
D: Well, you did dump me, so...
C: TINA
D: What could I do? You were all up in my business all the time. I couldn't breathe.
C: STAINER
D: It was my stupid job, wasn't it? You were embarrassed.
C: TINA
D: I work at Orange Julius, Elmer! If you would have just chilled out and been yourself...
C: STAINER
D: Okay, I can do that.
N: She holds up her finger with an engagement ring on it. Stainer drops his head onto the table. Tina rubs his hair for a second and then walks away.
S: INT. AIRPLANE - 737 - EVENING
N: Kirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the plane. From two rows back, Eric reaches over some other passengers to tap Kirk on the shoulder.
C: ERIC
D: Tom fuckin' Wopat, bro!
N: Eric hangs up a high five and Kirk leaves it hanging. Kirk takes a seat on the aisle next to Marnie. He gives Marnie a forced smile. She puts her head on his shoulder. Pan over to the window seat where Ron sits watching them, wearing his new travel pillow. Suddenly, there is a commotion at the front of the plane.
C: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: What!? You don't have authority on board this aircraft!
N: Stainer barges past the flight attendant, holding up his TSA badge.
C: STAINER
D: It's okay folks! TSA! This guy's drunk as fuck and he shit himself. We gotta get him off the plane.
N: Stainer grabs Kirk by the shoulder, pulls him out of his seat and about two rows down the aisle before Kirk overpowers him and stops.
C: KIRK
D: Stainer! What are you nuts!?
C: STAINER
D: You were right! I messed you up. We gotta fix this thing! Let's go.
C: KIRK
D: Stainer! No! Believe it or not, this isn't about you! In fact it's none of your business!
C: STAINER
D: Kirky! In junior high I peed my pants in class and Eric started calling me Stainer, remember?
C: KIRK
D: Okay, yeah?
C: STAINER
D: Pretty soon everyone else started calling me Stainer because they knew it would make me cry. Then you told me to own that name, to call myself Stainer so nobody could hurt me with it anymore.
C: KIRK
D: What's your point?
C: STAINER
D: My point is... um... Oh, shit. I was just in the crapper and I had this thing all worked out. Damn it.
N: The pilot is now behind Stainer and towering over him.
C: PILOT
D: Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to exit the aircraft immediately.
N: Stainer turns into his face.
C: STAINER
D: I'm going to have to ask you to fuck off immediately before I feed you your own fuckin' teeth!
N: The pilot backs up and goes for help.
C: KIRK
D: Jesus Stains! You're going to get arrested! And I won't be here to bail you out this time.
C: STAINER
D: Ooohh! That was my point! You saved me! That time and a bunch of other times too.
E: MORE
C: STAINER
D: You gotta let me save you this time. It's my turn! Your grandma didn't leave you three million bucks so you could take these a- holes to Branson.
E: CONT'D
N: Eric gets up and steps into Stainer's face. In mid-sentence and without pausing Stainer zaps Eric with a stun gun. Eric sails back into his seat as Stainer continues.
C: STAINER
D: These people hardly know you.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Stainer, I appreciate that you think you're helping me but I'm with Marnie now.
C: STAINER
D: Kirk, Marnie's a fuckin' bitch. All due respect.
E: to Marnie
C: MARNIE
D: Hit him Kirk! Or else I will!
N: Fuller and two other security people enter the plane. The pilot briefs them on what's happening.
C: STAINER
D: Kirk! You said Marnie makes you feel secure but security is bullshit! Look at our jobs! It's all for show! For all we know, there's a bomb on this plane right now!
N: The other passengers gasp and most of them look at Habib, who sits a few seats behind Kirk.
C: HABIB
D: What!?
N: Fuller grabs Stainer by the collar.
C: STAINER
D: You want to see what I think of security!?
N: Stainer turns and punches Fuller in the face, knocking him backwards onto the other agents.
C: KIRK
D: Oh, Stainer, what did you do?
C: STAINER
D: Kirk! When I added all this up for you I made one big mistake. You are a ten. YOU'RE A TEN, MAN!
N: Kirk just stares back. Fuller and the agents grab Stainer but he clutches a seat and stays put.
C: STAINER
D: You're not buying any of this bullshit are you?
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: No.
N: Stainer loses his grip and the agents drag him off the plane. Kirk sits down and Marnie comforts him.
S: INT. AIRPORT - EVENING
N: Over a bummed out song we see different areas of the airport. People on moving sidewalks. People on escalators. Bags moving around on a carousel. People in line. Flight Arrival and Departure times. Food trays moving down a buffet. Bags moving by on the x-ray monitor. People walking like cattle to their gates. Through the crowd, we see a man running against the traffic. It's Kirk!
S: INT. HILTON BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: Molly, looking beautiful in a formal gown, moves through a sea of tables. Hundreds of formally dressed people are seated around the tables, eating dinner. Molly greets, kisses and shakes hands with several people as she goes.
S: INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT
N: Kirk is huffing and puffing as he rounds the corner and arrives at the checkpoint. He looks around frantically.
C: KIRK
D: Randy! Where's Stainer!?
N: Randy points to a room marked, "Airport Security - Authorized Personnel Only."
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
N: Kirk bursts in to find Stainer bent over a metal table. Fuller (with two black eyes) and another agent hold him down as a homeland security agent stands behind Stainer, giving him the full cavity search. Kirk doesn't miss a beat.
C: KIRK
D: Stainer! I don't have a car here! I need your van!
C: STAINER
D: Right on! The keys are in my jacket!
N: A jacket is hanging by the door. Kirk reaches in and grabs the keys. He turns fast and exits. Fuller jacks Stainer's head onto the table.
C: STAINER
D: Kirky wait!
E: CONT'D
N: The door opens more slowly and Kirk regards his friend with great reverence. Stainer strains to lift his head against Fuller's strength.
C: STAINER
D: Listen, Kirk. It's three on the tree and the clutch sticks.
E: CONT'D dramatic pause and music
N: SLAM! Stainer's head is jacked back onto the table.
C: KIRK
D: Thanks buddy!
N: Kirk bolts.
S: INT. HILTON - SMALL BANQUET ROOM
N: This room is set up as a staging area for the cancer benefit. Patty and several others are buzzing around preparing for the next phase of the evening. Molly enters, holding a walkie talkie up to her head and speaking into it.
C: MOLLY
D: No, I need the staff ready to help with bids when the auction begins. - over.
C: VOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE
D: I don't think we can spare anyone - over.
N: Patty grabs the walkie talkie.
C: PATTY
D: Leslie! We're not here to feed these people, we're here to cure fucking cancer!
E: MORE
C: PATTY
D: Now I want every one of those motherfuckers back there taking bids in fifteen - out!
E: CONT'D
N: Patty tosses the walkie-talkie back and then crosses to help a group of young cancer patients, some in wheelchairs, to unpack their sculptures and label them for the auction. A stressed-out woman in a BEEHIVE hairdo picks up a SMALL BOY's sculpture. She hails Molly.
C: BEEHIVE
D: Ms. McCall, we've got a big problem.
C: MOLLY
D: What is it?
C: BEEHIVE
D: This young man has made an ashtray.
C: MOLLY
D: Okay. Well, what do you want from me? Kids make ashtrays.
C: BEEHIVE
D: It's a cancer benefit. Don't you think this sends the wrong message?
C: SMALL BOY
D: It's a really nice ashtray.
C: MOLLY
D: They're not bidding on the artwork; they're bidding on the kids. It's fine.
N: Beehive sighs hard and hands the ashtray back to the boy. Molly turns around and a look of surprise comes over her.
C: MOLLY
D: What are you doing here!?
E: CONT'D
N: Reverse to show Talon holding a ridiculously large flower arrangement.
C: TALON
D: I came to say I'm sorry and to put in a request for a second chance.
C: VOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE
D: Ms. McCall, the auction is underway - over.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm sorry. I have to get in there. Can we talk about this afterwards?
C: TALON
D: I'm looking forward to it.
S: INT. HILTON BALLROOM

C: EMCEE
D: Timothy Brigg's sculpture of a... fire truck? Sold to the woman in the green dress for four hundred fifty dollars. Congratulations ma'am and thanks so much.
N: Molly picks up the small boy's ashtray and joins the emcee on stage. She takes a deep breath before facing the crowd.
C: EMCEE
D: Our next item... Well, here she is folks, the woman who donates her time to make this amazing event possible, our own Molly McCall!
E: CONT'D
N: Huge applause.
C: MOLLY
D: Thank you. Thanks, Bob. I'm so sorry for my tardiness. The next item up for bids is from nine-year- old Walter Benegan. And this is a... little something that you can put your paper clips or do-dads in... Oh, who am I kidding, it's an ashtray. Let's start the bidding at one hundred dollars.
E: audience laughs
C: MAN

D: Two hundred to the...
N: MAN 2 Two Fifty.
C: WOMAN
D: Two seventy five.
C: MOLLY
D: Fantastic. Two-seventy-five. Do I hear three hundred?

C: MOLLY
D: Two Seventy Five going once. Going twice.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Ten thousand dollars!
E: O.S.
N: The small boy looks up, elated. The spotlight searches the room and lands on Kirk near the back. The audience applauds.
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk? I hope you don't really think this is going to...
C: TALON
D: Eleven thousand!
N: Talon stands across the room, crossing his arms in defiance.
C: MOLLY
D: What!?
N: Eric bursts in through a door near Kirk.
C: KIRK
D: Fifteen Thousand!
C: TALON
D: Fifteen thousand five hundred!
C: MOLLY
D: Both of you! This is ridiculous...
C: ERIC
D: Go get him Kirk! It's chump change to you now.
C: KIRK
D: Twenty Thousand!
N: The crowd applauds.
C: MOLLY
D: Is that a serious bid?
C: TALON
D: Fifty thousand dollars!
N: Bigger applause.
C: MOLLY
D: Talon! Please!
N: Eric makes a fist to indicate that it's time for the killing blow. Kirk nods back his agreement.
C: KIRK
D: Three million dollars!
N: Eric's eyes go wide. This is not what he had in mind. The crowd erupts into laughter. Talon also laughs off the bid.
C: MOLLY
D: Kirk, that's your entire inheritance.
N: The crowd shifts from laughter into excited chatter.
C: MOLLY
D: Folks, calm down. I don't want to get anyone's hopes up. It's only fair that I clarify something to the bidder. Kirk, please understand that if you commit this money, we will all be eternally grateful and I think your grandmother will be very proud of you... But it doesn't change anything between you and me.
E: CONT'D
N: This sets off a volley of whispers among the crowd and puts a smile on Talon's face.
C: MOLLY
D: So, again, is this a serious bid?
E: CONT'D
N: Kirk looks to Molly, then his brother - who is shaking his head NO! He then scans the hopeful expressions on the faces of the kids and their parents. Kirk takes a deep breath.
C: KIRK
D: Three million dollars.
C: ERIC
D: You stupid son of a bitch!
C: MOLLY
D: Three million going once. Going twice. Sold to the man in the Branson Bound sweatshirt.
N: The crowd cheers.
C: EMCEE
D: Congratulations to little Walter whose ashtray has brought in more than any piece in our history.
N: The young sculptor beams. The crowd cheers again. Kirk gives a smile and a nod of resignation as he leaves the room.
S: INT. HILTON BAR
N: Kirk and Eric sit at the bar, each nursing a drink. Eric is fuming.
C: ERIC
D: You are such a numbnut. I am telling you - absolute numbnuttery!
C: MALE VOICE
D: Excuse me. May I use that ashtray?
E: O.S.
N: Kirk turns to find that he is sitting next to BILLY JOEL, who is smoking a cigar. Eric passes him the ashtray that Kirk just bought.
C: ERIC
D: Sure. Careful with it there, Captain Jack. It cost him three million bucks.
N: Billy Joel, ashes in the ashtray.
C: BILLY JOEL
D: Yeah, I saw that. Tough break in there, my friend. Still, that was a hell of a good thing you did for those kids.
C: KIRK
D: Thanks.
C: BILLY JOEL
D: Beautiful women huh? What are you gonna do?
C: KIRK
D: I guess I'm going to go home.
C: BILLY JOEL
D: It's none of my business but I do know a thing or two about hooking up with women who are out of your league. Can I tell you a little secret?
N: Kirk and Eric look at one another in disbelief and then at Joel.
C: KIRK
D: Sure.
C: BILLY JOEL
D: Look, it's not about money, fame or power...
C: ERIC
D: Whoa! All due respect there, Big Shot. How would you know? You had all that shit when you bagged the big ones.
C: BILLY JOEL
D: Yeah, but I had all that shit when I lost 'em too. It's not enough.
C: ERIC
D: You believe this fuckin' guy?
C: KIRK
D: Jesus Christ, Eric! I'm trying to get some advice from Billy Joel. Do you think you could manage to shut the fuck up for two minutes!?
C: ERIC
D: Fine. Geeze. What's up your ass?
C: BILLY JOEL
D: Thank you. Look kid, it's not what you can give 'em or even what you can give up. It's what your made of.
N: Joel places a cocktail in front of Kirk and then clinks his own against it.
S: INT. HILTON BALLROOM - LATER
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome The Piano Man! The Entertainer! And our foundation's greatest champion! Mr. Billy Joel!
N: The crowd cheers as the curtain rises. The crowd's excitement turns to confusion. From the back of the room, Molly notices the crowd's reaction. She turns to see Kirk seated before the huge white grand piano, his hands sweaty and shaking over the keys. Kirk looks at the crowd. Hundreds of confused faces stare back at him. Beehive rushes Patty in a panic.
C: BEEHIVE
D: Aren't you going to do something about this!?
C: PATTY
D: Lady, he just gave three million dollars. He can go up there and try to blow himself for all I care.
N: Kirk wrings his hands as they shake harder. Billy Joel stands in the wings and gives Kirk a nod of, "You can do it." Molly turns to walk away but notes ring out from the piano and she stops. Kirk plays and sings "Just the Way You Are" - badly. His voice and hands shake but he forges on. The audience is confused, cringing and restless. Someone starts booing. Kirk can't help but glance up to see who it is - it's Eric. When Kirk reaches the instrumental break, he settles in a bit - he can actually play. As the last note fades, Kirk leaps up, and runs out into the...
S: EXT. HILTON BACK ALLEY
N: Kirk bursts out the door and vomits into a dumpster. He falls backwards against the wall and slides down into a sitting position.
C: MOLLY
D: You realize that there's a good chance this won't work out.
E: O.S.
N: Molly steps out into the alley.
C: MOLLY
D: And you could get hurt.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: I know.
C: MOLLY
D: And you're going to have to be naked in front of me at some point.
C: KIRK
D: I can work up to that.
N: Kirk stands up.
C: KIRK
D: So, you and me are...
E: CONT'D
C: MOLLY
D: Three million dollars for kids with cancer and you sing to me? I'm not made of wood you know.
N: Molly hugs him. The first intro riff of a piano version of "Pressure" kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy.
C: MOLLY
D: But one condition.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Anything.
C: MOLLY
D: You have to go brush your teeth right now.
N: Talon walks out into the alley, still holding the flowers.
C: TALON
D: So, Molly... Can we finish our conversation?
N: Kirk takes Molly's hand and leads her past Talon.
C: KIRK
D: Sorry Poncho, she's with me.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. WEDDING - DAY
N: Close on a preacher.
C: PREACHER
D: The vows you have just heard are a unique expression of the love between two souls.
N: Close on Kirk - looking dapper but sweaty and nervous.
C: PREACHER
D: Two souls who have come together this day in holy matrimony.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Close on Molly - looking more beautiful than ever.
C: PREACHER
D: And by the power vested in me by the great state of Nevada, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now...
E: CONT'D
N: A wider shot reveals the NASCAR theme wedding of Eric and Debbie. Kirk stands among the groomsmen. Each are dressed in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of certain drivers. Molly stands among the bridesmaids. Each dressed in a checkered-flag gown. Ron and Marnie are also in the wedding party. Debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and Eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss. Debbie grabs Eric's ass while Eric gropes her breasts. Stainer and Wheel in the Sky kick into "Any Way You Want It" from a bandstand nearby. Patty dances in front of Stainer - he winks back at her. Devon cuts up a wedding cake that looks like a full-sized racing wheel and tire.
S: EXT. WEDDING - STREET
N: The guests throw rice as Eric and Debbie run to a stretch Nascar limo. Eric picks up Debbie and loads her in through the window. He then runs around to the other side and jumps into that window. The limo burns rubber as it peels away. Pan across the guests as they wave goodbye; Devon and his squeaky clean family, Jack and a hot date, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Marnie & Ron. Patty and Stainer - making out. Kirk and Molly stand together arm in arm. Kirk holds a ceramic urn, painted with the Las Vegas skyline. Push in on the urn until the skyline becomes real. Push in toward the top of The Stratosphere Casino. Continue pushing in until we are inside the observation deck. Push through the gift shop where the TV is tuned to CNN. As we pass the TV we hear.
C: CNN ANCHOR
D: In a press conference held earlier today, NASA officials announced that affordable tourist travel to the surface of the moon will be a reality within the next ten to fifteen years.
N: Push past the TV, out of the gift shop and to the other side of the observation deck where we find Kirk and Molly. They kiss before they open the urn and pour Grammy's ashes over the side. THE END
