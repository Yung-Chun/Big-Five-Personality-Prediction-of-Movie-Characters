S: INT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING
N: Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS. BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard.
C: MS. BERRY
D: "Work." Today we're going to share what our parents do for work. QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside their desks, addressing the class:
C: JEFF
D: My dad is a truck driver.
C: MELINDA
D: My mommy is a doctor.
C: CAROLYN
D: My dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian.
C: THEODORE
D: My father is a struck-sher-al- engine-ear.
E: with difficulty
N: CRAIG - My mother is an actress. She works at Denny's.
C: KELLY
D: My daddy works at a place where they make stuff, and my mommy is a mommy.
C: ELLIOT
D: (looking a little
C: CRAZED)
D: My father is a postal worker. The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:
C: MAX
D: My mom's a teacher. As Max starts to sit:
C: MS. BERRY
D: And your dad?
N: MAX (HESITANT) My dad? He's . . . a liar.
C: MS. BERRY
E: taken aback
N: A liar? I don't think you mean "a liar."
C: MAX
D: Well... he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and--
N: MS. BERRY (RELIEVED) Oh! I see-- you mean he's a lawyer. Max shrugs.
S: INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY
N: FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His manner is utterly genuine and convincing.
C: FLETCHER
D: A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
C: FLETCHER
D: Well, for once I agree with t he prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client. Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
E: CONT'D
C: FLETCHER
D: Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs. As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM
E: CONT'D
N: OUT:
C: FLETCHER
D: You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- pouncing from the shadows. You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife?
E: CONT'D pointing at the old man
N: Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a weapon. The jurors RECOIL.
C: FLETCHER
D: And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.
E: CONT'D
N: FLETCHER (CONT'D) (CONCERNED) As you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. You want to help. First, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away. Second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet. Finally, you leap into the man's Lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. You breathe a sigh of relief: "Someone to look -after the injured man! Oh joy!" But do the police applaud your initiative? Do they hail your heroism? No-- they arrest you and throw you in the slammer! He walks along the jury box:
C: FLETCHER
D: And why? Why does the State turn its massive power against this individual? (takes an
E: CONT'D
C: IMPRESSIVE
D: moment, then answers his own
C: QUESTION:)
D: Discrimination, (to a black
C: JUROR)
D: But this time it's not based on race. (to a female
C: JUROR)
D: Not based on gender. Not based on religion, (to a heavy set
E: to a man wearing a crucifix
C: JUROR)
D: No--this time it's discrimination based on size! . I know what the prosecution wants you to think - - i t ' s always the big guy's fault. Is that what we've come to as a society -- persecuting people because they're large? Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.
C: FLETCHER
D: Shame on you, Mister Prosecutor! Shame on you! (turning back to
E: CONT'D
C: JURY)
D: The state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of Justice. Only you can douse the flames. The decision is your s. And please...don't let your emotions run away with y ou . The fact that my client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case. In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.
C: FLETCHER
D: Instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower! Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. COURTHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
N: Fletcher bounds down the stairs, passing a fellow LAWYER,
C: LAWYER
D: How's it going, Fletcher?
C: FLETCHER
D: Another gratifying day serving Justice. Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.
E: he' s won
C: CLIENT
D: Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I wish there was some way I could show my appreciation.
C: FLETCHER
D: Stay out of my neighborhood after dark. A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Mr. Reid, do you have a moment-?
C: FLETCHER
D: No, I'm late picking up my son.
C: PUBLICIST
D: -Because a couple of reporters want to interview you about your big win today. Fletcher instantly shifts directions.
N: FLETCHER .. How's my hair? And he's off to woo a GANG OF REPORTERS.

C: JERRY
D: Fletcher, good to see you?
C: FLETCHER
D: What? No kiss for me?
C: JERRY

C: AUDREY
D: Max.
C: JERRY
D: He'll love it there.
C: AUDREY
D: It's Fletcher.
C: JERRY
D: Fletcher?
C: AUDREY
D: I can't move Max three thousand miles away from his father.
C: JERRY
D: Audrey, I have never said a bad word about your ex --
C: AUDREY
D: I know.
C: JERRY
D: But how much responsibility does Fletcher take for Max, now? He'd never come over if you didn't remind him.
C: AUDREY
D: I know. But if they're three thousand miles apart they'll never see each other. Fletcher will never come to Boston and how can I send Max cross-country to him?
C: .JERRY
D: So because your ex-husband is unreliable, we can't-'-
C: AUDREY
D: I know, it's not logical, it's emotional. I'm sorry. Pause.
C: JERRY
D: I still want to marry you.
C: AUDREY
D: Are you sure? Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper, dials.
C: JERRY
D: Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry She!ton... I hope I'm not calling too late... Mr. Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have to turn down your offer..'. So am I . . . Well, I've fallen in love with this beautiful woman in L.A. and she doesn't want to leave and I won't leave without her... Well, thank you very much... Yes, good-bye.
E: into phone
N: (hangs up) He wasn't there, but that's 1 the speech I would've made. She smiles and KISSES him. The PHONE RINGS. Audrey answers.
C: AUDREY
D: Hello...
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
C: A UDREY
D: Fletcher, where are you? We're getting ready to cut the cake.
C: FLETCHER
D: Urn, actually, something has come up. A problem on a new caaa-- . Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.
C: F LET CHE R
D: A-h-h-h-!
C: AUDREY
D: What happened?
C: FLETCHER
D: Nothing. I just nailed my knee into the desk... Listen, I'm really sorry I can't 'make it.
C: AUDREY
D: Max is going to be so disappointed.
C: FLETCHER
D: I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?
C: AUDREY
D: Do you want me to put him on the phone? Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.
C: FLETCHER
D: Ah, no. I have to go.
C: AUDREY
D: Right. ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.
S: INT. AUDREY AND MAX'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old. Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.
C: AUDREY
D: All right, birthday boy, make a wish. Max doesn't respond.
C: AUDREY
D: C'mon, honey. It can be anything-- whatever you want most in the world. When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..
E: CONT'D
C: AUDREY
D: Max, your dad is sorry. He had to work.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: He said he was coming. He promised.
C: AUDREY
D: Yes, well, he... promises he'll see you tomorrow. Max doesn't believe it. < He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake. In VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.
C: MAX
D: I wish, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up, up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
N: A clock on a wall. It's 9:15'. We are--
S: INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is adorned with Fletcher's shoes... To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang... To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing... To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--
C: MIRANDA
D: S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.
C: FLETCHER
D: I've had better. Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF CLOTHES follow. The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants. A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .
S: INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING
N: An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With regret and wonder he remembers:
C: FLETCHER
D: "I've had better?"
S: INT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING
N: Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in the mirror, mouth foaming.
C: FLETCHER
D: "I've had better?!"
S: INT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
N: Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.
C: FLETCHER
D: "I've had better?" I t arrives. He steps in.
E: laughing it off
S: INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING
N: The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a beautiful young WOMAN.
C: FLETCHER
D: New in the building?
C: MODEL
D: I just moved in Monday.
C: FLETCHER
D: Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour.
N: MODEL (SHE'S
C: INTERESTED)
D: O h? Do you do that for all the new tenants?
C: FLETCHER
D: No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...
S: INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
N: We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.
S: EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING
N: A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he is accosted by a BEGGAR.
C: BEGGAR
D: Any change, Mister?
C: .FLETCHER
D: Absolutely. But he continues walking.
C: BEGGAR
D: Could you spare some?
C: FLETCHER
D: Unquestionably. Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.
C: BEGGAR
D: Will you?
C: FLETCHER
D: No.
C: BEGGAR
D: How come?
C: FLETCHER
D: Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs...
C: BEGGAR
D: Jerkoff.
S: INT. COURTROOM - MORNING
N: A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,
C: VIRGINIA
D: You look like you're having a rough morning.
C: FLETCHER
D: I've had better. He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.
C: DANA
D: Good morning, Fletcher.
C: FLETCHER
D: Dana. "
C: RICHARD
D: All right, Virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this?
C: FLETCHER
D: Fifty per cent of your estate. Richard is SHOCKED.
C: DANA
D: Fifty per cent? With a pre- nup and proof of adultery? What's your case?
C: FLETCHER
D: Our case is simply this. . . Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.
N: DANA . Interesting, though based on your track record, I expected a little more. Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs the brief. FLETCHER .. Wa it! Wait! I've got it in writing! But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.
C: DANA
D: Let go!
C: FLETCHER
D: I'm trying!
N: He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out. At this moment the BAILIFF calls.
C: BAILIFF
D: All rise for the Honorable Judge William Stevens.
C: DANA
D: Very funny, Fletcher. You want to play hardball, I'm game. JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Calling case BA 09395, Richard Cole versus Virginia Cole. How're we doing this morning, counsel?
C: DANA
D: Fine, thank you.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: And you, Mr. Reid?
C: FLETCHER
D: Well, I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night-- Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what he just said. After an awkward silence--
N: JUDGE STEVENS (DRYLY) Well, you're still young. It'll happen more and more. In the meantime, what do you say we get. down to business? First, Mr. Reid, I see that your client was previously represented by Mr. Rand of your office.
C: FLETCHER
D: Yes, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: I take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?
C: FLETCHER
D: Yes, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Fine , fine. And for the record, the reason is?
C: FLETCHER
D: Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: I take it you don't share the same ethical objections, Mr. Reid?
C: FLETCHER
D: I have lower standards, Your Honor.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole wants the substitution of counsel, I'll allow it. Is that what you want, Mrs. Cole? Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.
N: VIRGINIA (UNSURE) Yes?
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Fine.
C: VIRGINIA
D: (aside, to
C: FLETCHER)
D: What are you doing?
N: FLETCHER (WORRIED) I don't know. (to judge, with SOME
C: DESPERATION)
D: Your Honor, I ' d like a continuance!
N: JUDGE STEVENS " This case has already been delayed several times, Mr. Reid.
C: FLETCHER
D: I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: I'll have to hear good cause, counselor. What's the problem?
N: FLETCHER'S P.O.V. The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then faster -- until we wind up squarely on -- FLETCHER'S FACE
C: FLETCHER
D: I can't lie!
N: JUDGE STEVENS (IMPATIENT) Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm still waiting for the good caus e. Now, do you have it or . not? ' FLETCHER (TRUTHFUL) Not.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case?
C: DANA
D: I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to --
N: FLETCHER (DESPERATE)
C: SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!
D: Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate. He BANGS the gavel.
S: INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING
N: Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge
C: DANA
D: Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid.
C: FLETCHER
D: It certainly does.
C: DANA
D: However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid.
C: FLETCHER
D: Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?
C: FLETCHER
D: No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When
E: utterly sincere
N: attorneys go to sleep at night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers.
C: DANA
D: Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it -- I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away. She brandishes the audiotape.
C: JUDGE SAMIOAN
D: Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a dynamite explanation, I'd say you're dead in the water. How's you client's story?
C: FLETCHER
D: The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Strong corroborating evidence?
C: FLETCHER
D: We have evidence that you are not going to-believe. Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?
C: FLETCHER
D: . "Confident" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.
E: hopeless
C: DANA
D: All right! Double the offer! Four point eight! And not a penny more. (venomous, to
C: FLETCHER)
D: Bastard! She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer.
T: CUT TO:
C: VIRGINIA
D: No!
N: We are --
S: INT. COURTROOM - MORNING
N: Fletcher has joined Virginia at the respondent's table
C: FLETCHER
D: No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle. I'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,
C: FIND-NO-LINE-AT-THE-FRIGGIN'-
D: DMV miracle! You've gone from two point four to four point eight million in... (checks his
C: WATCH)
D: four minutes. Think of it this way -- now you're getting paid seven hundred thou per schtupp!
C: VIRGINIA
D: Mr. Reid, you convinced me yesterday -- I'm the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--
C: FLETCHER
D: Seven!
C: VIRGINIA
D: -- Seven other men. With the story you came up with, I don't think I can lose. I want to proceed.
C: FLETCHER
D: Mrs. Cole, you don't . understand, I-- But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a settlement? Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm. He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Th ere' s no settlement. Trial to start at one-thirty sharp. He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HALLWWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING
N: DA ZED, Fletcher makes his way down the hall. Jane comes toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He tries to avoid her, but...
C: JANE

N: FLETCHER . I think you need help. HORRIFI ED, Fletcher hurries on. The heavyset Thomas ambulates in his way. -
C: THOMAS
D: What's shakin', Fletcher?
C: FLETCHER
D: Your cellulite, Tubster. The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.
C: FRED
D: Hiy a, Fletcher. How's the Cole case going?
C: FLETCHER
D: 'Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with my career right behind it.
E: not stopping
N: Fletcher is RUNNING NOW, COVERING HIS EARS and SINGING LOUDLY so as not to hear OTHER EMPLOYEE 'GREETINGS... FLETC HER LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA!! Fletcher speeds past--
C: GRETA
D: Hi, boss. What's happening
N: WITH-- FLETCHER DON'T ASK! FOR GOD'S SAKE,
C: PLEASE DON'T ASK!
D: -- And races into his office.
N: I NT . FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath. FLETCHER, (PACING) Do n't panic. You can beat this -- it's all a matter of willpower. He dives for his desk and rifles through it.
C: FL ET CH ER
D: A test. . . Something small... Aha! He holds up a BLUE PEN.

D: ' I'll write.it! He takes a sheet of PAPER, his pen and writes "This pen i s . . . " He tries to write an "R" but can't. He STRAINS. S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote
C: INADVERTENTLY:
D: "This pen is blue."
N: F LE TC HE R NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ! ! ! Greta enters to find-- FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in the air.

D: Are you all right?

D: Before I forget -- Rubin and Dun n called. They want to know where the Darvis settlement offer stands.
C: FLETCHER
D: I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it. . Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks.
C: GRETA

D: shaking his head
C: "NO")
D: Yes.
C: GRETA
D: I ' m having a little trouble following you. what do I say to your mom?
N: FLETCHER (RESIGNED) Tell her I'm a thoughtless son who'd rather spend ten hours clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her-- but only if she asks. You.might also add that she deserves better, though I hope to God you don't.
C: GRETA
D: Thanks for clearing that up. And that's it, except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son.
N: FLETCHER (REMEMBERS) OHH! I'M SUCH A SHIT!! He reacts, particularly stunned by this truth.

D: But then I thought, "No, that 's not fair. Fletcher didn't mean to insult me."
E: CONT'D
C: (STRAIGHTENING
D: his tie) "It was just some massive, boneheaded misunderstanding, and Fletcher is very, very sorry." Fletcher smiles. It looks like he's off the hook, until--

C: M IRANDA
D: But -- what about last night?

D: I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise. Unpaid parking tickets.
E: begrudgingly, off the officer's look
N: (BESEECHINGLY) Be gentle.
S: EXT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: A cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is headed to her car.
C: FLETCHER
D: Audrey, wait!
C: AUDREY
D: Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait.
C: FLETCHER
D: I can explain--
C: AUDREY
D: I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab?
C: FLETCHER
D: Yes.
C: AUDREY
D: Where's your car?
N: EXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.
C: FLETCHER
D: Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me.
C: AUDREY
D: I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents.
C: FLETCHER
D: Ow.
N: At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and. parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.
C: FLETCHER
D: You scratched my car!
E: CONT'D
C: TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
D: Where? .
C: FLETCHER
D: Right there!
C: TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
D: Oh that? That was already there.
N: FLETCHER (OUTRAGED) Why, you -- you liar! Do you know what I ' m going to do about this?
C: TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
D: What?
C: FLETCHER
D: (angrier and
C: ANGRIER)
D: ...Nothing! Because if I take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if I finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what I'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe!
C: TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
D: You've been here before, haven't you? He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.
C: AUDREY
D: Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out.
C: FLETCHER
D: Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation.
N: . AUDREY What do you want to say?
C: FLETCHER
D: You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair.
C: AUDREY
D: Let' s define "fair." Last night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair?
C: FLETCHER
D: Last night--
C: AUDREY
D: -- Was none of my business. When it happened two years ago it was my business, but now I don't have to care anymore. See, that's the magic of div orce . But it does matter to Max. Everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do.
C: FLETCHER
D: All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him.
C: FLETCHER {CONT'D)
D: I have an idea. I'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with M ax. Have him invite some fri ends over. We'll have a game and everything. Then, you and I can sit down and talk.
C: AUDREY
D: We're suppose to be on a plane
N: TONIGHT--
C: FLETCHER
D: No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too.
C: AUDREY
D: You're really coming?
C: FLETCHER
D: This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time?
C: AUDREY
D: ...Six?
C: FLETCHER
D: Ten-to-six.
N: AU DR EY (UNSURE) All right... only if I tell Max you're coming and you don't show up and I have to see that look on Max's face -- that heartbreaking look-- it's Boston, Fletcher.
C: FLETCHER.
D: I will be there.
N: As Audrey gets in her car -- .
C: AUDREY
D: I hope so. Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie. She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive, when a new thought strikes him.
C: FLETCHER
D: Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it!
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY
N: Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his arm.
S: INT. MAX'S KINDERGARTEN CLASS

N: FLETCHER (WARY) Yes.
C: MAX

C: FLETCHER
D: Well, actually--
C: MS. BERRY
D: Children! .Mr. Reid is going to tell us what it's like to be a lawyer. She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.
C: FLETCHER
D: Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. He starts out.
C: MS. BERRY
D: One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe some of the children have
C: QUESTIONS
D: Jeffrey?
E: hands shoot up
C: JEFF
D: What kind of lawyer are you?
C: FLETCHER
D: Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.
C: BILLY
D: What's that?
C: FLETCHER

C: CRAIG
D: So what do you do?
C: FLETCHER
D: I help people fight over their money and their children.
E: growing more and more impatient
C: THEODORE
D: Can't they fight without you?
N: FLETCHER ' " They could but then J wouldn't make a living.
C: JILL
D: Why would my daddy leave my mommy?
C: FLETCHER
D: To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:
N: MS. BERRY (BRIGHTLY) Well, I think it's time for fingerpainting.
S: EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
N: They're in the playground just outside the classroom.
C: FLETCHER
D: Monster-Max.
C: MAX
D: Dadzilla. You came to play catch?
C: FLETCHER
D: No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again.
C: FLETCHER
D: I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen?
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair...
C: FLETCHER
D: That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh.
N: ' MAX . I want to play kickball with my friends.-
C: FLETCHER
D: Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed.
C: MAX
D: Really? You mean you have to tell the truth?
C: FLETCHER
D: Yes.
C: MAX
D: No matter what?
C: FLETCHER
D: No matter what.
N: Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.
C: MAX
D: Is wrestling real?
C: FLETCHER
D: In the Olympics, yes. On . Channel 23, no.
C: MAX
D: Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind?
C: FLETCHER
D: Not in a million years.
C: MAX
D: If I keep making this face-- (makes a horrible
C: FACE)
D: will it get stuck that way?
C: FLETCHER
D: Uh-uh.
C: MAX
D: .If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown?
C: FLETCHER
D: Only if you can't 'swim.
C: MAX
D: Why do I have to eat squash?
C: FLETCHER
D: Because your mom buys it.
C: MAX
D: How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels awful.
C: FLETCHER
D: I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together.
C: MAX
D: Baseball?
C: FLETCHER
D: . Yes! This is absolutely an A-number one promise. You and I -- tonight -- baseball. Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.
C: FLETCHER
D: Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back.
C: MAX
D: So you can lie?
C: FLETCHER
D: Not to you.
C: MAX
D: To who?
C: FLETCHER
D: Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me "How do I lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? Max nods.
C: MAX
D: You didn't think she was beautiful.
C: FLETCHER
D: Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? Max shakes his head "no."
C: FLETCHER
D: Will you help me anyway? A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.
E: CONT'D
C: FLETCHER
D: That's my boy! Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on himself.
E: CONT'D
C: FLETCHER
D: Now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish. Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He takes a breath-- and blows them out.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: I did it. ^
C: FLETCHER
D: Great! Great! Now to test --
N: Fletcher spots an attractive FEMALE teacher. Fletcher hurries to her and says something. A moment. Then she
C: SLAPS HIM.
D: Fletcher returns to his son.
C: MAX
D: Did it work?
N: FLETCHER . . (rubbing his sore
C: CHEEK)
D: Not like I ' d hoped. Did you really unwish it? Max nods.
C: MAX
D: Only...
C: FLETCHER
D: Only what?
C: MAX
D: Yesterday, when I wished it, I r ea lly meant it. This time when I unwished it I only did it 'cause you told me to.
C: FLETCHER
D: Well, then do it again. Only this time, mean it.
E: losing patience
C: MAX
D: I can't.
C: FLETCHER
D: Why not?!
C: MAX
D: Because I don't want you to lie.
C: FLETCHER
D: I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies--
C: MAX
D: But you're the only one who makes me feel bad.
N: Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts. MS. BERRY (CALLING) Max, recess 'is over, come on in.
C: MAX
D: I have to go.
C: FLETCHER
D: I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? Max hesitates, then nods.
C: FLETCHER
D: I'll see you tonight, buddy... That's a promise. Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY
N: A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by.
C: MACHO ATTORNEY
D: Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging?
C: FLETCHER
D: Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway.
C: PHILIP
D: Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card --
C: FLETCHER
D: No --
C: PHILIP
D: Or my phone was busy --
C: FLETCHER
D: No --
C: PHILIP
D: Or you just forgot --
C: FLETCHER
D: No --
C: PHILIP
D: (cannot be
C: DISCOURAGED)
D: Or something. So anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty! Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him resolutely.
C: FLETCHER
D: Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then --
C: PHILIP
D: Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's this new karaoke bar I've been dying to try. I'll pick you up at your office! Seven- thirty! ! And he runs off. Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.
S: INT. OFFICE'S - DAY
N: Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.

C: FLETCHER
D: O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day.
C: GRETA
D: Kids...
C: FLETCHER
D: It came true.
C: GRETA
D: What?
C: FLETCHER
D: It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning?
C: GRETA
D: Well, yeah, but...
N: (INCREDULOUS) You're telling me that you can't lie.
C: FLETCHER
D: That's right! I am incapable of lying.

N: Miranda is 'eavesdropping. A wicked gleam in her eye,
S: INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE

D: You don't believe me.
C: GRETA
D: Of course not.
C: FLETCHER
D: Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. She thinks.
C: GRETA
D: A ll right. Remember a few months ago, I wanted a raise--
N: FLETCHER (QUICKLY) Forget it. Let's not do this.
C: GRETA
D: -- and the firm wouldn't.give me one. And I asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldn't permit it because it creates jealousy among the other secretaries? Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough?
S: INT. OUTER OFFICE
N: Greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes. She's leaving. Fletcher is on the phone and looks very harras,sed.

C: NOD)
D: Tell me, what do you think of him?
N: FLETCHER (HELPLESS) He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. MIRANDA (GRINNING) How delightful! She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

C: MR. ALLAN
D: Marvelous! Marvelous! That's what I love most about this firm-- the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good- fellowship! Miranda is incensed.
C: MR. ALLAN

D: Your Honor, I object!
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: And why is that, Mr. Reid?
C: FLETCHER
D: (can't help
C: HIMSELF)
D: Because it's devastating to my case. The judge is startled by his candor.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Overruled.. As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously
C: DOWNS THE GLASS.
D: Periodically CUTTING to Virginia, Mr. Cole, Dan and the thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor engaged in intense physical activity.

D: All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed.
C: FLETCHER
D: How?! Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak... when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him. After a momement, he grins.
E: to himself
C: FLETCHER
D: Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break?
E: CONT'D
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: It can't wait?
C: FLETCHER

He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack. A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.

C: JUDGE STEVENS

E: CONT'D
C: JUDGE STEVENS

E: CONT'D
C: JUDGE STEVENS

E: CONT'D
C: FLETCHER
D: Yes, I can.

C: VIRGINIA
D: Mr. Reid, you remember Laurence Falk, the man from the tape.
C: FALK
D: How are you?
C: FLETCHER
D: I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.
C: VIRGINIA
D: Shouldn't we go over our testimony?
C: FLETCHER
D: Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions--
C: VIRGINIA
D: And we give the explanation you came up with.
C: FLETCHER
D: Exactly.
C: FALK
D: So all we have to do is lie. Sounds simple enough.
C: FLETCHER
D: Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--" But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT. The others look concerned, but he waves them off.
C: FLETHCER
D: Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--
E: CONT'D
N: IO-.H To his horror, he GAGS AGAIN, .unable to form the word.
C: FLETCHER
D: Oh my God! I can't do it! I can't finish the question if I know the answer is a lie! At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.
E: to himself
C: MR. ALLAN
D: Don't let me interrupt, Fletcher. I just want you to know I'll be observing this a fternoon. Miranda insisted I see you in action. Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.
C: MR. ALLAN
D: I'm looking forward to it. Go get 'em!
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving Fletcher more desperate than before.

C: FLETCHER
D: Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole?
C: FALK
D: Yes.
C: FLETCHER
D: Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The "not" was INVOLUNTARY. It takes everyone by surprise.
C: FALK
D: Excuse me?
C: FLETCHER
D: If I might rephrase your Honor. Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not?
E: trying again
C: X\
D: Is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic? Is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? (thinks he's got it, beams with
C: CONFIDENCE)
D: Mr. Falk, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?
N: FALK (CONFUSED) No. I mean, yes. I think.
C: FLETCHER
D: Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?
C: FALK
D: What?
C: FLETCHER
D: How 'bout just answering the question you think I'm asking? '
C: DANA
D: Your Honor, he's badgering the wintness!

C: FALK
E: breaking down
N: YES, YES,-- IT'S TRUE! I HUMPED HER. BRAINS OUT! ! A GASP from the audience. All eyes are on Fletcher. FLETCHER (WEAKLY) No further questions.
C: DANA
D: Uh...no questions.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Call your next witness.
E: to Fletcher
C: FLETCHER
D: I have no further witnesses, your Honor. A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: You have no further witnesses?!
N: Fletcher meekly shakes his head, no.
C: VIRGINIA
D: (whispers, to
C: FLETCHER)
D: What are you doing? Call me.
C: FLETCHER
D: I can't.
E: to Virginia
C: JUDGE STEVENS

C: VIRGINIA
D: Call me, damn it!
C: FLETCHER
D: You don't understand. I can't lie . Until nine-sixteen tonight, I can't even.ask a question that calls for a lie! Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.
C: VIRG INIA
D: L is ten , you bastard. I want m y money. I am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience! Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia said.
C: FLETCHER
D: Thirty-one?
E: to himself
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Mr. Reid, we're not getting any younger... Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup and her passport.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Mr. Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule in favor of --
E: he's had it
N: FLETCHER WAIT! Silence. FLETCHER . (DRAMATICALLY) Your Honor, I call Virginia Cole to the stand. Stunned, Virginia nervously makes her way up,
C: MR. ALLAN
D: What the hell is he doing?
E: in the gallery
C: MIRANDA
D: Kissing his career goodbye. The Baliff stands before the witness.
C: BALIFP
D: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God?
C: VIRGINIA
D: I do. Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY.
C: FLETCHER
D: Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia?
C: VIRGINIA
D: Yes.
C: FLETCHER
D: But that would be a lie, wouldn't it?
C: VIRGINIA
D: What do you mean?
C: FLETCHER
D: Isn't your true name...
N: (BRANDISHING
C: PASSPORT)
D: Carlotta?!
C: VIRGINIA
D: Well, yes. But it wasn't me so I started using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that?
N: FLETCHER . Not really. It's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life. Let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, Carlotta? He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it,
C: F LETCHER
D: Your driver's license. What color are your eyes?
C: VIRGINIA
D: Blue.
C: FLETCHER
D: Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then?
N: VIRGINIA (RELUCTANTLY) Brown.
C: FLETCHER
D: And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you? C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will.
E: off her silence
C: VIRGINIA
D: Brunette.
C: FLETCH ER
D: More like a dirty brown, isn't it? Let's see - . - " Weight: one-o- five"? Please...
E: she nods
N: VIRGINIA . One-eighteen. (off his look) One-twenty-six. I swear!
C: FLETCHER
D: So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself?
N: VIRGINIA (JOYFULLY) Wrong! I didn't lie to make myself younger. I made myself older. I was born in 1965!" FLETCHER (FEIGNING
C: SURPRISE)
D: What? You're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older?
C: VIRGINIA
D: Yes! " lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I
C: GOT-ALL-THE-ANSWERS-BECAUSE-I-
D: went-to-law-school'!
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Mr. Reid, does this have a point?
C: FLETCHER
D: Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR
E: on a roll
N: CAN ENTER INTO A LEGAL CONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT INCLUDING--
C: DANA

C: HERSELF)
D: Prenuptual agreements.
C: FLETCHER
D: (knows he has
N: THEM)
C: PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK
D: YOU VERY LITTLE! This contract is void!!! The fact that my client gets nailed more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant. Standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven point three-nine- five million dollars!! Yo . . . . a e . . . . T A T T T ! ! u r OSTT!
E: to Dana
N: (DRAMATICALLY) Nothing further, your Honor! A MURMUR OVERTAKES THE ROOM!

C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: In light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars. The courtroom ERUPTS. FLETCHER'S WON! Dana, Mr. Cole are devastated. '
C: MR. ALLAN
D: That son of bitch pulled it off! Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously, Miranda gives him the finger.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct?
N: FLETCHER AND DANA YES--
C: VIRGINIA
D: No! I'm contesting custody.
N: Fletcher freezes.
C: FLETCHER
D: What?
C: VIRGINIA
D: Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million.
E: re: her husband
C: FLETCHER
D: He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? .
C: VIRGINIA
D: No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts.
C: FLETCHER
D: But -- but -- you said he was a good father.
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.
C: FLETCHER
D: No. .
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: In that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. Court is adj ourned! He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her kids.
C: VIRGINIA
D: Stop that! We're leaving now!
C: CHILD
D: I want to go with Daddy.
N: V,' Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away from their tearful father.
C: MR. COLE
D: Don't worry. I'll see you no matter what. I promise. Mr. Allan has made his way up to Fletcher.
C: MR. ALLAN
D: (re: the
C: COMMOTION)
D: I love kids. They give you so much leverage in a case like this. (pats Fletcher on
C: BACK)
D: Congratulations, partner. how does it feel? And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr. Cole and his kids, the truth dawns on Fletcher like a sledgehammer!
N: FLETCHER ' Excuse me. Just a second. (to the Judge) Y our Honor? Your Honor? Wait!
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.
C: FLETCHER
D: Screw that!! She lies and she wins ?! What are we, nuts? Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.
C: FLETCHER
D: T his woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! And now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too?
E: CONT'D
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: Mr. Reid, you are out of order!
N: FLETCHER (SCREAMING) SO'S THE HAND DRYER IN THE MEN'S ROOM!! Do you ever stop to ask yourself, why do people hate us? Could it be because what we did here today sucks?! We don't care about the truth! We don't want to find the t r u th ! We want to win! We want to win at all costs...and you know what the worst thing about wanting to win so badly i s ? WINNING! Winning and finding out you're left with nothing!
C: JUDGE STEVENS
D: That's enough, Mr. Reid --
C: FLETCHER
D: -Let' s see what I' ve done today. I've helped a gold digging slut get richer. I'm taking this guy's kids away. I don't like you in the least, now I'm one of your partners!
E: to Mr. Allan

D: Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog, rain, something, anything... He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD " F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17." Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!! Holy Shit!!
S: INT. LAX ESCALATOR
N: Fletcher pushes his way HE a crowded escalator. Past people standing on the left despite the SIGN that says STAND ON RIGHT.
C: FLETCHER
D: Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on folks, let's let the frantic man pass... Sorry... Thank... you... Standing on the right, passing on the left. They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money...
C: WOMAN

E: speeding past
N: HIM) NOT NOW, TOGA BOY!
S: INT. LAX - SECURITY AREA
N: Fortunately, there's no line at the metal detector. Fletcher races right by but SETS OFF THE ALARM.
C: INSPECTOR
D: Please step through again.
C: FLETCHER
D: Ahhh!! ! Damn..; Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex into a tray. He tries again. It BUZZES again!
C: FLETCHER
D: What? I'tii practically naked! A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.
C: FLETCHER
D: It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...
N: The wand BEEPS over Fletchers front pocket. He reaches in and pulls out the now familiar BLUE PEN...
S: INT. LAX - DEPARTURE CONCOURSE
N: Fletcher races by Gate 15, 16, gets to 1 7 . . . but sees the PLANE Slowly TAXIING AWAY. FL E TC H ER N ooo!!! Fletcher spots a door marked "NOT AN EXIT". Goes for it when a FLIGHT ATTENDANT interrupts.
C: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: Can I help you?
C: FLETCHER
D: Look out!! ! --
N: (TRUTHFUL)
C: -NOTHING'S COMING!!
D: The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!
S: EXT. TARMAC - DAY
N: He scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane which is moving away. No way he'll catch it. Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT (These are the steps they pull up to planes) Fletcher gets an insane idea. . . The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.
C: WORKER
D: Hey!! Hey!!!! But Fletcher's gone.
S: EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY
N: Fletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the plane. GROUND WORKERS react. Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane. Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low to see in the plane. He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS THE STEPS! The "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.
S: INT. AIRPLANE - DAY - MOVING
N: PASSENGERS calmly read while outside FLETCHER speeds along, WAVING HIS ARMS like a maniac. The ENGINE NOISE drowns out his call for... F LET CH ER MA X ? !! AUDREYY?!! A STEWARDESS stands in the aisle, giving the safety lecture.
C: STEWARDESS
D: In case of a water landing, please use your seat cushion
C: AS--
D: Her MOUTH DROPS as she notices Fletcher.
S: EXT. TARMAC - DAY
N: Fletcher is BANGING on the windows. People on the plane POINT, STARE in amazement. Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO THE WING! Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls. At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS. He surfs under the wing... ... and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side. Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally spots. . . MAX, AUDREY AND JERRY SEATED IN THE BULKHEAD Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him. Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER. Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO
C: NOISY.
D: Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!
C: FLETCHER'S POV
D: The RUNWAY is ENDING!.
N: Just then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.
C: AUDREY
D: (checks under his
C: SEAT)
D: It's right here, honey.
C: M AX
D: Mom! Mom!! '
C: AUDREY
D: Just a second, Max.
C: MAX
D: Mom, it's dad!
C: AU DREY
D: W hat? What about dad? Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...
C: AUDREY
D: Fletcher?!
N: AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN! BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE CART. . - And BAM! FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING! Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE! CLOSE ON FLETCHER With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
N: Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED. He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES.
C: FLETCHER
D: (mumbles to
C: HIMSELF)
D: Oh boy, the truth hurts. Yes indeed.
C: DEPUTY
D: Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a shoe, and still holding the compress. FLETCHER (WEAKLY) Greta? Is that you? He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY waiting for him just outside the door. Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY. He sees his dad, then quickly turns away.
C: FLETCHER
D: Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really. You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . .
E: to Audrey and Jerry, trying to seem chipper no response
C: AUDREY
D: Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing?
C: FLETC HER
D: That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin...
C: FLETCHER
D: Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty,
C: SINCERELY)
D: I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life... you and Max. This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher said, but the way he said it.
C: FLETCHER
D: I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.
C: AUDREY
D: You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight.
C: FLETCHER
D: I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry.
C: FLETCHER
D: I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again?
C: JERRY
D: I design security systems.
C: FLETCHER
D: How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec?
C: JERRY
D: The biggest.
C: FLETCHER
D: One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds . ..
C: AUDREY
D: Don't put Jerry in the middle.
C: JERRY
D: It's okay. Boston means this (snaps his
E: to Fletcher
C: FINGERS)
D: to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy. Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I'll go along with. They both look to Audrey.
C: AUDREY
D: All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the stairs. He's still upset.
C: AUDREY
D: You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today.
C: FLETCHER
D: Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,
N: TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.
C: FLETCHER/TERMINATOR
D: I have been sent from the future to destroy you. . . Argghhh! (no response, a
C: BEAT)
D: You mad at me? Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:
C: FLETCHER
D: You wanted me to stop lying. But lying isn't the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that's the problem. Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way... But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more
E: touches him
N: important things. Much more important things. I was so stupid, Max. (pointing to his own head) Malfunction in vector one. All this time you've been here and I could see you anytime I felt like it. And I... didn't. Please don't go to Boston. Max, I love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. I couldn't say it if it weren't true. Not today. A moment as Max studies his father, then:
C: MAX
D: He's telling the truth, Mom. He's not allowed to lie. I made a wish and anything Dad says has to be the truth. .. Right? But Fletcher's looking at his watch...
E: to Audrey to Fletcher
C: FLETCHER
D: Max. .. it's 9:22.
C: AUDREY
D: What?
C: FLETCHER
D: Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I've been able to lie for the last seven minutes. Max steps away from Fletcher.
C: MAX
D: So then, you were...
C: FLETCHER
D: No! It wasn't a lie. I just wanted to be honest with you and tell you -- there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. You just have to believe me. Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.
C: MAX
D: Mommy... do we have to go to Boston? Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.
E: to Audrey
C: AUDR EY
D: No. We don't have to. Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll never let you go."
C: MAX
D: Can we play catch tomorrow? Fletcher smiles. . .
E: to Fletcher
S: EXT. PARK - DAY
N: A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...
C: M AX
D: Dad! !
C: FLETCH ER
D: Ma x i mu m ! ! Fletcher picks Max up.
C: MAX
D: Transformer!!! . Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...
C: FLETCHER
D: Malfunction in vector seven. I have lost control of my affection reflex... Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He sees Audrey.
C: FLETCHER
D: Procreate! Procreate!
N: AUDREY (PLAYFULLY) Fletcher... You're gonna lose a limb--
C: MAX
D: Come on, dad, let's play catch!!
C: FLETCHER
D: Sr. . .
C: UE
D: (starts to toss
C: MAX)
D: Here you go, mom. Oh, you mean with a ball... He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.
E: Max screams
C: FLETCHER
D: I take back every dirty, dishonest thing I ever said about you, wrote about you, faxed about you, E-mailed about you.
C: JERRY
D: Appreciated. Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.
C: FLETCHER
D: So, you up for a little friendly competition?
C: JERRY
D: No, you go play with your son.
C: FLETCHER
D: I wasn't talking about basesball. A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the ball to Max.
C: FLETCHER
D: Alright, it's time to show you the old Fletcher Reid change up.
E: to Max
N: Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP. Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too. There may be better things in life... but at this moment, it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly. THE END
