M: Joel Hopkins
M: Sound of a piano being played. Sparse but beautiful.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. RECORDING ROOM - DAY
N: HARVEY SHINE, mid-60's, sits at a piano in a scruffy recording room, tinkering. We hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze. Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates him, accompanied by a knocking sound. From behind a studio window, JOHNNIE, a young rocker type in his 20's beckons. Harvey closes the piano lid.
S: INT. STUDIO - DAY
N: Johnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons, sits at a mixing desk. In front of him are 2 large TV monitors. Harvey joins him.
C: HARVEY
D: Put my score up first.
C: JOHNNIE
D: They don't want to hear it, Harvey.
C: HARVEY
D: I know, but I want to hear it. Put it up.
C: JOHNNIE
D: I'm backed up already, Harvey.
C: HARVEY
D: Johnnie, you were the one that was late. Just put it up.
E: interrupting
N: Johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons. A `cheesy' commercial for a washing detergent plays. It is accompanied by a jolly classical score. Harvey looks on forlornly at his work. As it comes to an end with a flourish, Harvey lowers his head. Beat. Johnnie glances at him.
C: JOHNNIE
D: Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away.
N: Harvey looks up, confused.
C: HARVEY
D: Huh?
C: JOHNNIE
D: Look, I'm not doing myself any favours here, Harvey. But, I'd watch your back.
N: We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face.
S: INT. STUDIO CAR PARK / QUEENS - DAY
N: Harvey hurriedly exits the studio, catching up with a man walking to his car.
C: HARVEY
D: Marvin? Hey, Marvin?
C: MARVIN
D: Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in London?
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's going on?
C: MARVIN
D: Huh?
C: HARVEY
D: Johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on Monday.
C: MARVIN
D: Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking that, what with you being in London - you should stay a while.
C: HARVEY
D: What?
C: MARVIN
D: There's no need to rush back. Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
C: HARVEY
D: What?
C: MARVIN
D: Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he can pitch the Samuelson account.
C: HARVEY
D: No, I'm coming back. Those are my connections. They have been for years.
C: MARVIN
D: I know but... they've got new people running things over there. I think they're after something... ...different.
E: beat
C: HARVEY
D: I want to come back. I should be there in person.
C: MARVIN
D: `There in person'? Harvey, nobody cares.
C: HARVEY
D: I have to stand behind my music!
C: MARVIN
D: They're demos! - They're already pressed. No one needs to be there. They're not looking for you, they're not looking for me. They just need a fucking track. Harvey, you haven't booked a top line in 8 months.
E: beat/sighs
C: HARVEY
D: You got me doing triangle chimes for Christ's sake - give me something to compose!
C: MARVIN
D: That's what I'm trying to tell you! It's not about composition! It's different now!
N: Silence. Harvey looks at Marvin.
C: MARVIN
D: What?
E: CONT'D
N: Beat.
C: HARVEY
D: I'm back on Monday, Marvin. I'm coming back.
N: Beat.
C: MARVIN
D: You got to land this one, Harvey.
E: sighs
C: HARVEY
D: What are you saying? Say it!
E: beat
C: MARVIN
D: I'm saying there are no more chances, Harvey. Enjoy London.
E: beat
N: And with that Marvin gets in and drives off, leaving Harvey standing alone in the car park. We hold on his face - he's tired. He looks about him, then down at his raincoat draped over his arm. He lifts it and drapes it over the other arm.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: LAST CHANCE HARVEY Sound of interior airborne plane. The seat-belt `ping' chimes.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PLANE - NIGHT
N: Harvey, seated in a crowded economy cabin, looks down from the now extinguished seat-belt light. He looks a little hot. Reaching up to turn on the air, he knocks his tray - knocking his drink into his lap.
C: HARVEY
D: Shit!
N: An attractive middle-aged woman, seated next to him, looks over.
C: HARVEY
D: Miss? I'm sorry. I've spilt my drink.
E: CONT'D to a passing Stewardess
C: STEWARDESS
D: I'll get you some napkins.
C: HARVEY
D: Why's it always me?
E: to his neighbour
N: The woman, perhaps wary of the length of the flight, smiles noncommittally. The Stewardess returns.
C: STEWARDESS
D: Shall I take that?
C: HARVEY
D: Thanks... And could I get another?
C: STEWARDESS
D: A whiskey, wasn't it?
C: HARVEY
D: Yes. `Jamesons', no ice.
N: The Stewardess heads off. Harvey mops himself up. He places the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs. Glancing out the window, he then turns to the woman.
C: HARVEY
D: A holiday?
E: CONT'D
N: The woman looks over.
C: WOMAN
D: No. Business.
N: Harvey nods.
C: WOMAN
D: Yourself?
E: CONT'D feeling obliged
C: HARVEY
D: My daughter's getting married.
C: WOMAN
D: Congratulations.
C: HARVEY
D: Thank you. She's marrying an American. But for some reason we've all got to go over to London. I told her we had a perfectly good wedding system here.
E: smiles beat smiling MORE
C: HARVEY
D: They both work there, you see.
E: CONT'D beat/expecting more of a response
N: The woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess returns with Harvey's drink.
C: HARVEY
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D
N: Harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman interrupts.
C: WOMAN
D: I'm really sorry but I have a meeting in the morning and I must try and get some sleep.
C: HARVEY
D: No... Of course. I'm sorry.
C: WOMAN
D: It's just, I'll be useless - unless I get some sleep.
C: HARVEY
D: Sure.
N: The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her light, turning herself away from Harvey. We hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of darkness.

T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
N: A radio hangs from a mail trolley. KATE, mid 40's, dressed in a green uniform, turns into the path of a suburban house. She passes a postman - who nods his head.

D: Hello, my daughter.
N: They kiss.
C: MAGGIE
D: Have a cup of tea with me.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: I can't, I'm running late.

C: MAGGIE
D: He's at it again.
C: KATE
D: Who? At what?
E: looking through her bag
C: MAGGIE
D: The neighbour. Barbecuing or something.
N: We see her POV of her neighbour busying himself in his back garden. Smoke rises from a small garden shed.
C: MAGGIE
D: I heard he's from Poland.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: So maybe Polish people like to barbecue a lot. I'm leaving your prescription on the table. You know, you don't have to keep taking these - the Doctor said.

C: MAGGIE
D: `Time and tide', Kate, as your father liked to say.

D: I'm sorry. That was mean.
E: CONT'D beat/takes a breath MORE
C: KATE
D: Look, I'll call you later. I love you.

S: INT. PSA / LOCKER ROOM - DAY
N: Kate places her bag in a locker and takes out a pair of heels. Sitting down to put them on, Aggie enters.

D: Scum.
N: Aggie giggles to herself and writes it in. Kate stands just as another co-worker hurries in.
C: OONAGH

N: She kisses Kate on the cheek and opens her locker.
C: OONAGH
D: Thank God you're my boss.

E: CONT'D

C: OONAGH

S: INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY

N: Harvey comes through a set of sliding double doors, wheeling his case behind him.
S: INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY

C: KATE
D: Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a few very quick questions, could I?
C: HARVEY
D: I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.

C: HARVEY
D: Look, I'm sorry, but I'm tired, you know?
E: starting to walk on

N: A Taxi pulls away from the Terminal.
S: INT. TAXI - DAY
N: Harvey sits in the back with his phone to his ear.

N: Harvey hangs up. He dials another number.
C: HARVEY
D: Hi, it's Harvey, Harvey Shine here. Just wanted to confirm Mike for Monday. I'm in London at the moment, but reachable on my cell. Which is... Well you've probably got it on file, but just in case, 917... Well you may have to dial an international code first, I'm not sure. Anyway, it's 917 749 7558. That's 917 74...

N: A sharp `beep' cuts him off. Harvey hangs up and looks out the window. Cranes loom on the horizon. He yawns.

D: No, sir.
N: The Concierge looks at Harvey. Beat. Harvey shrugs.
C: HARVEY
D: I'll go up.
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
N: Harvey enters the room. He places his case on the bed, takes off his jacket and goes to the window. A roller blind is pulled down. Harvey tugs on the cord, to no avail at first. Then suddenly it whips up, causing Harvey to duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out. Warily, Harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy street below. He goes to open the window but it is stuck. He tries again - but it won't budge. He looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted blind. Tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower the blind a little. It slowly starts to unravel and unravel...and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window sill with a gentle thud. Harvey stands in semi-darkness. Just then, to his relief, his phone rings. He hurries over to the bed and retrieves it.
C: HARVEY
D: Hello? Suzie! Hi darling. Yes, I'm here. Where are you - where is everyone? Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I thought the plan was for everyone to stay together.

C: KATE
D: Sorry i'm late.
C: OONAGH
D: Don't tell me... ...your mother?
E: makes the gesture of a telephone
C: KATE

C: OONAGH
D: Very suspicious.
C: KATE
D: I know.
E: smiles
C: OONAGH
D: I got you the same as me. They're at the bar. He seems very nice.

C: YOUNG AFRICAN MAN
D: Shall I open this for you?
N: He heads towards the window. Harvey turns.
C: HARVEY
D: Careful!
N: Too late. The blind wips up - toggle hitting the young man in the eye.
C: HARVEY
D: Are you Ok?
E: CONT'D
N: The porter, covering his eye, nods, backing towards the door.
C: YOUNG AFRICAN MAN
D: Oh, yes. Yes, fine.
C: HARVEY
D: Are you sure? Here.
N: Harvey wedges a fiver into his free hand as he retreats rapidly. The door closes. Beat. Harvey returns the phone to his ear.
C: HARVEY
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D
N: No answer. He sits down on the bed and pours some tea. Just then his phone rings again. He reaches for it, knocking the trolley and the tea onto himself.
C: HARVEY
D: Fuck!
E: CONT'D
N: Grabbing a tea towel, he dabs his trousers.
S: INT. PUB - NIGHT
N: From a distance, across a crowded Friday night bar, we watch our gang chat. It seems to be going well. Laughter hangs in the air.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant. Harvey steps out, dressed in the same cream jacket, but now sporting a pair of dark trousers. He looks like a bad lounge act. The cab pulls away as Harvey turns towards the restaurant.

C: KATE
D: My dad had a front one that you could just take out.
C: HARVEY

S: EXT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY
N: Harvey and Kate exit the restaurant. They stand opposite each other in the quietening Terminal.
C: KATE

C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Sorry. Excuse me.
E: O.S.
N: Kate looks up to see Harvey making his way down the crowded carriage.
C: HARVEY
D: Sorry.
N: People reluctantly make way for Harvey and his case. He finally arrives next to Kate as the train jolts forward. Momentarily losing his balance, Harvey steadies himself on a businessman's shoulder. Kate leans forward to help, as the businessman turns slightly irritated.
C: HARVEY
D: Sorry. Hi. I thought i might as well stay in town. More fun than a hotel next to a runway, right?

S: INT. TRAIN - DAY

S: EXT. LONDON STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Montage: Accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty, we watch from a distance as Harvey and Kate navigate the buzzing streets of central London. All is alive and well. Harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was staying in before. As they wander through the city, foreign students mingle, policemen chat, and office workers linger. London is at its best.
S: EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The sky glows a pale orange as Harvey and Kate walk and talk along the South Bank.

N: They start walking again.
C: KATE
D: She means well. She's just had a tough run. My Father ran off to France with his secretary. Then mum got cancer, about four years ago now. She's fully recovered. But won't admit it. She's basically bored. And my continued `situation' as she calls it, being single, is her major distraction. Her pastime if you will.

N: Harvey shrugs.

S: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Maggie, very tentatively, lifts her curtain again. No sign of the `Killer'. Suddenly the doorbell rings.
S: INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: As Maggie, slowly approaches the front door, the doorbell rings again. She slowly leans in and peers through the peep- hole. POV: The Neighbour looms large. He holds in his arms a large `something' wrapped in paper. Maggie pulls her head away. Beat. She looks again. POV: The Neighbour bends down out of sight and then rises again, turning to leave. Maggie watches him go.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The door slowly opens. Maggie looks around then notices the `thing' wrapped in paper on the ground. She quickly picks it up and takes it inside.
S: EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON
N: As daylight fades, Harvey sits waiting. Through a large ground floor window, he watches Kate, as her class wraps up. As she comes out, he gets up and joins her.
C: HARVEY
D: How did it go?
C: KATE
D: Oh, the usual. Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us the latest installment from his Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all tried to look at him in the same way after.

C: HARVEY
D: Why, thank you Kate Walker.
N: Just then a sort of Skiffle come Rockabilly busking act starts up. Two girls and a guy. They're great! Harvey and Kate stand amongst the crowd watching. The South Bank is at its vibrant best.
S: EXT. SOUTH BANK - DUSK
N: With the sound of the Skiffle act still playing in the distant background, Harvey and Kate take a seat on some steps over-looking the river. As darkness descends, street-lamps reflect off the water. They sit in silence. Then...
C: KATE
D: What happened Harvey? Between you and your daughter?
E: beat
N: Beat. Harvey shakes his head.

D: I don't know. Somewhere along the way I lost her. I lost my family. I just woke up one morning and realised i didn't belong.
E: beat beat
N: Beat.
C: HARVEY

C: HARVEY
D: Sorry Brian... Sorry to interrupt.
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone stares at Harvey. Silence.
C: HARVEY

N: Silence. Harvey stares out at the party. They all stare back at him. He glances down at Kate who smiles back. Harvey lifts the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips.
C: HARVEY
D: No Jean. I want to make a scene. You know. I'm tired of being embarrassed. If we can't make a scene on the day of our daughter's wedding, then when can we? I want to make a scene. I want to shout! I wanna tell the world how lucky it is to have our Suzie in it!

S: INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT
C: PETE
D: Ladies and Gentlemen, the first dance.
E: MC
N: The BAND strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching. After a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower from the table display and places it in his lapel. Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance.
C: SUSAN
D: Thanks for coming back Dad.
N: Beat.
C: HARVEY
D: Thanks for having me back.
N: Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter. Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate smiles at her lot. Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes up. Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone. Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to leave. Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children. Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate amongst the crowded room.

S: INT. ELEVATOR / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to close. She stares at her feet. Just then we hear a burst of a piano being played. It stops. Kate looks up to see, across the hallway, in an empty conference room, Harvey seated at a grand piano. He smiles a showman's smile before giving it another `old school' burst. He stops again. Kate smiles. Just then the doors begin to close. Kate reaches forward and presses a button - opening them. Harvey starts up again - but this time he plays something sincere - beautiful. Kate listens before slowly stepping out of the elevator. She walks towards him, joining him at the piano.
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
N: Harvey slides along the seat and indicates for Kate to join him. She does so and listens as Harvey plays beautifully. He's good. He finally brings the piece to an end.

C: HARVEY
D: Hey kid, they're playing our song.
E: CONT'D
N: Kate smiles.
C: KATE
D: Yes.

E: excited
N: Harvey leads a slightly reluctant Kate back down the hall towards the reception.
S: INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT
N: The band let rip on a funky tune. The congregation fill the dance-floor. Harvey leads Kate back into the room and heads straight for the dance-floor. As they pass relatives along the way, Harvey introduces them to Kate. Much hugging and kissing ensues. Harvey and Kate dance a boogie. Uncle Fred and Aunt Maddie join them. Uncle Fred steals Kate from Harvey and twirls her off. MONTAGE: Fun and Frolics on the dance-floor. Harvey is at the center of it all. He initiates a Horah. A Congo line. Russian dancing! Kate's face says it all - she's having a ball. The sleeping kid, sleeps.

S: EXT. HOTEL STEPS - NIGHT
N: Harvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on the steps of the hotel. Harvey looks on as his daughter and son-in-law head to an awaiting car. Susan stops and throws the bouquet behind her. It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up' niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of braces on her teenage teeth. Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye. And is about to get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey.
C: SUSAN
D: Bye Dad.
C: HARVEY

C: SUSAN
D: Be gentle with him.
N: Kate nods as Susan turns to leave.
C: HARVEY
D: Sorry.
E: to Kate
N: Kate smiles. As the car pulls away, everyone cheers. Harvey looks on. His eyes momentarily lock onto his ex-wife's. They share a conciliatory look. As Harvey watches his daughter's car disappear down the street, Kate looks at him. He turns back. Beat.

S: EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAWN
N: They turn into the courtyard of Sommerset House and take a seat on some chairs. The sky lightens.
C: KATE
D: I don't think I've stayed up all night since I was a student.
N: They stare out over the courtyard. Silence. Harvey looks at Kate for a beat.
C: HARVEY
D: You got sad. Why?
N: Kate looks back at Harvey and tries to read him. She looks down at her lap, then up, out over the courtyard.
C: KATE
D: Oh, I don't know. My uniform's green?
N: The sun begins to creep above the buildings. Harvey and Kate look out across the courtyard.

C: HARVEY

D: Shut up, Harvey.

E: beat
N: Kate smiles a little smile. She suddenly believes him.
C: KATE
D: Ok.

N: Kate smiles.
C: KATE
D: Harvey Shine.
C: HARVEY
D: Can I have something until tomorrow.
N: Kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo. She gives it to Harvey.
C: KATE
D: I must go.
E: stepping backwards
N: She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus. Harvey stands holding an old library card. He looks down. On it is a faded photo of toothy young girl, no older than eleven. Harvey looks up and smiles.
S: INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING
N: Kate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus. Taking a moment to catch her breath, she looks out the window. Turning back, she allows herself a smile...
T: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - EARLY MORNING

N: Harvey enters, and waving to a slightly bemused concierge, heads to the bank of elevators.
C: HARVEY
D: Morning.
C: CONCIERGE
D: I'm afraid they're both out of order, Sir.
N: Harvey glances at the sign, then over to the stairwell.
C: HARVEY
D: I guess i'll walk, then.
S: INT. STAIRWELL - MORNING
N: Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life', runs up the steps. Surprised at first by his agility, he begins to slow. He stops to catch his breath. Suddenly his spare hand holds tight onto the bannister. Unsteady Harvey sits down. Close up on Harvey's face, confused. He tries to stand but again is forced back down. He begins to place his coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders, grabbing his shoulder. The coffee topples, spilling down the steps.
C: HARVEY
D: Shit.
N: Frightened and confused, Harvey sits alone in the stairwell. Just then, a door opens and the African porter from before, comes through, carrying a tray. He sees Harvey.
C: PORTER
D: Sir, are you Ok?
N: Harvey looks up in a daze, then shakes his head.
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - MORNING
N: Kate, with a skip in her step, walks through the bustling mid- day streets of London. She stops off and buys a bag of cherries from a `Fruit & Veg' vendor.
S: EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
N: As the porter and concierge talk to a medic, Harvey sits in the back of an ambulance. The door is closed.
S: EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
N: Kate sits waiting, expectantly, on the same chairs they had sat on earlier. She applies some lipstick.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Harvey sits attached to various monitors and such, surrounded by doctors and nurses. He looks agitated and confused.
C: HARVEY
D: I've got to go. I've got to be somewhere.
C: DOCTOR
D: Sir, I need you to stay calm. It looks to me like Arrhythmia - an irregular heart-beat.
C: HARVEY
D: Yes, S.V.T'S, that's what I've been trying to tell the nurse. I've had it since I was a kid. I take Primax. I guess i've been forgetting to take it recently. I've been under alot of stress, that's all.
C: DOCTOR
D: Well Ok, then we probably know where we're at. But I need to check all possibilities.
S: EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
N: As time passes, we watch as Kate's expression slowly turns from expectant to resigned.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
C: HARVEY
D: I know it's Arrhythmia! Please, I have to be there.
C: DOCTOR
D: Sir, I'm 99% sure it is. But my job is to make sure it's not that 1%. I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't check out absolutely everything. Nurse, we'll do an EKG, followed by Bloods. And can you arranfe a monitored bed for him for tonight.
E: beat
N: As another pad is attached to his chest, Harvey looks beaten.
S: EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
N: Kate looks on as some kids play in the fountain nearby. She self-consciously smooths a fold in her skirt, then looks at her watch. Beat. She looks down at the brown paper bag of cherries. Suddenly a resigned smile flashes across her face - she's been here before ­ nothing new. Kate gets up and leaves. We watch her walk away.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: Sound of a vacuum cleaner.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Open on a close up of Kate's face - it says it all. Kate vacuums her mother's floor. She turns it off and unplugs it. Coiling up the cord, Kate puts the vacuum cleaner into a cupboard under the stairs.
C: KATE
D: Ok mum, that's me, I'm done.
E: calling out
N: Maggie comes out of the kitchen.
C: MAGGIE

S: INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY
N: Harvey, having hung up, lowers the phone from his ear. He looks around the room. Seated across the way an old man stares back at him. A receptionist arrives with some forms.

N: Harvey signs a form.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: And there. And that's it.

They ended up picking one of your old tunes. They want you to come back and update it. We need you back, Harvey. Your old room's here waiting for you. Harvey?
E: beat beat
N: Harvey looks around the room at the lonely figures, waiting. A young boy fidgets. Next to him sits a young man, lost in thought.

D: Kate, I want this. I want you.
N: A button is pushed in Kate.
C: KATE
D: But it's not just about you, is it? You don't know anything about me. Look at me. It's pathetic. I expected you not to show for God's sake. I think I even wanted you not to be there, it's easier that way. You - you just dive in wherever, deep end, whoosh. But, I'm not your bloody swimming pool Harvey.
E: beat beat starting to break MORE
C: KATE
D: And I am not going to do it, I'm not going to do it because it will hurt.

I don't want this...
E: CONT'D
N: Kate turns and walks away, standing by the balustrade, looking down at the river below. Harvey watches. She takes a seat on a bench. Harvey gives her, her space. Then slowly he approaches, leaning against a tree nearby. Long beat.
C: KATE
D: I think it's actually easier for me to be disappointed. I think I'm actually angry at you for trying to take that away.
E: CONT'D
N: Long beat. Just then Kate's phone rings. She reaches into her bag and takes it out. She stares at the phone, thinking for a beat, before answering.

C: KATE
D: That's better.
N: Harvey glances down at Kate's feet, then up at her.
C: HARVEY
D: I think you're my kinda girl.
