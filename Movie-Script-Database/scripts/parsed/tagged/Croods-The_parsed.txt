M: SEQ. 75 - PROLOGUE
T: FADE IN:
N: A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES TO: Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to know them as The Croods.
C: EEP
D: With every sun comes a new day. A new beginning. A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.
E: V.O.
N: The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for food. Scared. Fast. The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.
C: EEP
D: But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is my family, the Croods. If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark. Night after night, day after day. Yep. Home sweet home. When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world. And I struggled to survive my family.
E: V.O.
N: The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.
C: EEP
D: We were the last ones around. There used to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs, common cold. And, the Croods. That's us. The Croods made it...
E: V.O.
N: Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.
C: EEP
D: Because of my Dad. He was strong... and he followed the rules.
E: V.O.
N: A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his family home.
C: EEP
D: ... the ones painted on the cave walls. Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad. Basically, anything fun is bad. Welcome to my world.
E: V.O.
N: They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock door closed. SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this time the light casts an ominous tone.
C: EEP
D: But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.
E: V.O.
N: RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND. HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY. SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...
C: EEP
D: Because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end. And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.
E: V.O.
N: CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen.
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming, growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.
C: GRUG
D: Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!
N: As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade. Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a signal, but before any sound escapes his lips-- A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.
C: GRUG
D: You're supposed to wait for my signal Eep. Eep?
E: CONT'D
N: Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.
C: EEP
D: We've been in that cave forever.
C: GRUG
D: Three days is not forever.
C: EEP
D: It is with this family.
C: GRUG
D: Eep would you come down here? You're being so dramatic.
N: A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is more terrier-like.
C: GRUG
D: No, no, no Sandy, come back here. Remember the signal. Good girls wait for the signal.
E: CONT'D
N: A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to her display.
C: GRUG
D: Ugga.
E: CONT'D
C: UGGA
D: As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.
C: GRUG
D: No, I mean, you're already out now.
C: THUNK
D: I am waiting for the signal, dad.
E: O.S.
N: We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates his every move.
C: GRUG
D: Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.
C: THUNK
D: Uhh, but if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?
E: not so fast
C: GRUG
D: The signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.
N: Beat.
C: THUNK
D: Then why is the signal an animal noise? I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?
N: Grug sighs.
C: THUNK
D: I don't know... I'm still waiting for the signal.
E: CONT'D
C: GRUG
D: Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
N: Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over by the boulder.
C: UGGA
D: Mom, we're ready to leave. Mom!
E: BEAT
N: Grug sits up and smiles.
C: GRAN
D: Still alive!
N: Grug's face drops.
C: GRUG
D: It's still early.
C: GRAN
D: And you're still fat.
C: GRUG
D: Breakfast formation!
N: The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the lead.
C: GRUG
D: I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast. We do this loud, we do this as a family and never not be afraid. Go!
E: CONT'D
C: THUNK
D: YAY, BREAKFAST!!!!
N: COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon, across the wide expanses of desert.
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 150 - SMASH & GRAB
S: EXT. MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING
N: Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING GROUNDS. They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.
C: THUNK
D: Yeah... breakfast...
E: HUFFING
N: We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. The Croods take shelter behind a rock. Grug PEERS over the top.
C: GRUG
D: Who's up?
N: Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.
C: GRUG
D: We'll flip for it.
E: CONT'D
N: Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.
C: GRUG
D: Call her in the air.
E: CONT'D
C: EEP
D: Heads.
N: Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her tail is showing.
C: GRUG
D: Tails. Thunk's in.
C: GRUG
D: Positions.
E: CONT'D
N: The family fades back and splits up. They get into fighting/running position.
C: GRUG
D: Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
E: CONT'D
N: Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES the egg.
C: GRUG
D: Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
E: CONT'D
N: Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon. A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.
C: GRUG
D: Oooh!
E: CONT'D
C: GRUG
D: Release the baby.
E: CONT'D
N: Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the egg from its beak. Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting cable on a carrier. Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.
C: UGGA
D: Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods!
N: Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder. ON GRAN DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM in behind her. The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.
C: GRAN
D: Old lady down! Eep, avenge me.
N: ON EEP Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep LAUNCHES. Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.
C: EEP
D: Thanks!
N: A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.
C: GRUG
D: Eep!
C: EEP
D: Heads Up!
N: Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again. Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks. The family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave. An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head back to their cave. The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the chase. Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each family member onto the Girelephant's back. Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant. Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.
C: THUNK
D: Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?
C: GRUG
D: Just wait till we get home. Eep put on the brakes.
N: The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon. Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes over the other. Together they dig their heels into the ground, slowing down the Girelephant. The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.
C: GRUG
D: Eep!
E: CONT'D
N: The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble. Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up the egg.
C: GRUG
D: Who's hungry?
E: CONT'D
C: THUNK
D: Alright! Good one, dad!
C: GRUG
D: Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
N: Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it cracks open.
C: THUNK
D: Sorry, dad.
C: UGGA
D: Looks like fast food tonight!
N: The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.
C: GRUG
D: That's alright. I ate last week.
N: A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to gauge how much daylight is left.
C: GRAN
D: Two knuckle warning.
C: UGGA
D: Come on Croods. Go, go, go.
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 200 - WELCOME TO CROOD CAVE
S: INT. CROOD CAVE - EVENING
C: GRUG
D: Come on, come on. Darkness brings death! We know this.
N: The Croods RUN INSIDE THE CAVE. Ugga picks up a heavy stick off the floor.
C: UGGA
D: The moon is full. Bath night. (grumbling, Gran tries to run
C: AWAY)
D: You too, Mom.
C: GRAN
D: Run for your life.
N: Ugga pulls Gran back.
C: GRAN
D: I don't want to lose my protective layer.
E: CONT'D
C: UGGA
D: Mom, you've got ants.
E: hanging Sandy up
N: Whack! Like she's cleaning a rug, Ugga SMACKS Sandy hard with the stick. Dust and bugs fly off of her.
C: UGGA
D: See? Sandy doesn't fuss.
E: CONT'D
N: Ugga CLAPS her hands together and Sandy knows to let go. She hits the floor and SCAMPERS away.
C: GRAN
D: Aaaaaaaaaah.
E: UPSET
N: Grug enters and looks around the cave.
C: GRUG
D: Is she still out there?
C: UGGA
D: You know she hates the cave, Grug.
N: ON EEP clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above Crood cave. She RAISES HER HAND to `catch' a few more moments of sun.
C: EEP
D: Please come back tomorrow.
N: ON GRUG getting his `bath.'
C: GRUG
D: How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy.
C: UGGA
D: It is a little, dark, Grug.
C: GRUG
D: It's not that dark.
N: Grug is finished with his bath.
C: GRUG
D: Eep! Eep?
E: CONT'D LOSING PATIENCE
N: Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.
C: GRUG
D: Come on, I gotta close the cave...
E: CONT'D
N: ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the very top.
C: GRUG
D: Eep!
E: CONT'D
N: Eep continues to climb.
C: EEP
D: Okay, okay!
C: GRUG
D: Come on.
N: Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.
C: GRUG
D: EEP! COME DOWN!!
E: CONT'D
N: Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature, allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug barely gets the cave closed in time.
C: GRUG
D: SIGH
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORY The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening, and FEELS around for the Croods. The Croods are like mice in this world.
C: GRUG
D: That was too close!
C: EEP
D: I was watching. I was fine.
C: GRUG
D: What were you doing up there, Eep?
C: EEP
D: I don't know.
C: GRUG
D: What were you looking for?
C: EEP
D: Nothing.
C: GRUG
D: Well then why did you go up there?
C: EEP
D: I don't know.
E: ANNOYED
C: GRUG
D: Why don't you know? Stop looking for things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never not be afraid.
N: Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where a tiny spot of light seeps in.
C: EEP
D: What's the point of all this?
E: TO HERSELF
C: GRUG
D: Hmmm? What was that?
C: EEP
D: I mean, why are we here? What are we doing this for?
E: a little louder
C: CROODS
D: GROAN
C: GRUG
D: No one said survival was fun.
C: EEP
D: Nothing is fun.
C: GRUG
D: Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?
N: No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down.
C: UGGA
D: Grug. Off.
C: GRUG
D: Yes.
N: Grug climbs back up.
C: UGGA
D: Off!
C: GRUG
D: I just don't see why she needs her own ledge. That's all. That's what this is about.
C: UGGA
D: She's working through some things and needs her own space.
C: GRUG
D: What things? How long is this going to take? Really? I mean she already doesn't listen to me.
N: A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's ledge.
C: GRUG
D: Hey!
E: CONT'D
C: UGGA
D: See? She's listening.
C: GRUG
D: If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
C: UGGA
D: How about a story? Eep loves those.
N: Grug brightens.
C: GRUG
D: That's a good idea ... How about a story, huh?
E: BRIGHTENING
C: THUNK
D: Oh yeah, tell us a story.
N: The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from the bone-crib.
C: GRUG
D: Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep! Your old favorite?
C: EEP
D: I haven't played with that thing in years.
C: GRUG
D: Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
N: Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays put. As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave.
C: GRUG
D: A long time ago, this little bear was alive. She was alive because she listened to her father and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror. So she was happy. But Krispy had one, terrible problem. She was filled with... curiosity.
E: CONT'D
C: UGGA
D: Grug!
N: Ugga covers Sandy's ears.
C: GRUG
D: Yes. And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
C: THUNK
D: Wha?
C: GRUG
D: And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died.
N: Grug SWATS the painting.
C: THUNK
D: Just like that?
C: GRUG
D: Yes! Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
N: Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.
C: GRAN
D: Oh, same ending as everyday.
C: THUNK
D: I get it, dad. I get it. I will never do anything new or different.
E: FREAKED OUT
C: GRUG
D: Good man, Thunk.
N: Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with stories all seemingly with the same ending.
C: UGGA
D: Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and let's pile up.
N: All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
N: SEQ. 500 - FOLLOW THE LIGHT
S: INT. CROOD CAVE - NIGHT
N: The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep, who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting. But then, SILENCE. And then cutting through the primordial night is a MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the "door" to peer outside, when suddenly-- WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW. She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to catch it in her hands. Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the disappearing light. Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes all of her strength, but she manages to move it just enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.
S: EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS
N: Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is exhilarating. The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels herself. Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon, we...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CANYON
N: The light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick underfoot. It was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES. A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow. She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected speed. The Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and...
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
S: EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT
N: Eep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches. REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING. But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her, something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and creeps up behind her. Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder. It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash the Creature's brains in.
C: CREATURE
D: Nuh! Nuh!
N: The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front of its face.
C: GUY
D: No!
N: Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to this monstrosity. The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy... he's BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY.
C: EEP
D: Augh!
N: Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's foot.
C: GUY
D: AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH!
C: EEP
D: Shhh!
N: Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the head.
C: EEP
D: Ow!
E: CONT'D
C: GUY
D: Air.
E: GASPING
C: EEP
D: ...You talk.
C: GUY
D: I'm a person, like you.
N: Eep TOSSES the boulder aside and LIFTS Guy with one hand.
C: GUY
D: Sort of... like you.
E: CONT'D
N: Eep OPENS Guy's mouth and pokes around inside. She SNIFFS at him. Turns him upside-down.
C: GUY
D: Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that tickles. Hey!
E: CONT'D
N: Eep looks closely at BELT, a sloth wrapped around Guy's waist. Belt's eyes OPEN.
C: EEP
D: Augh!
N: Eep DROPS Guy on his head.
C: GUY
D: OW! Wow. --
N: Eep jams her foot over Guy's mouth.
C: EEP
D: Quiet! I'm not supposed to be out here.
N: Guy BITES her foot.
C: EEP
D: OW!
E: CONT'D
N: She KICKS Guy in the stomach. He ROLLS sideways. Guy is getting the worst of this encounter. Eep kicks Guy off- frame. We HEAR the fight continuing.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CROOD CAVE
N: Grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening. He pushes the "sleep pile" off of him. Checks Eep's ledge... but she is gone.
C: GRUG
D: Eep's gone.
E: TO UGGA
C: UGGA
D: What? Grug!
C: GRUG
D: Stay in the cave!
N: Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave. Peering into utter darkness. He steels himself... and then releases his hand from the "door."
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 560 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (PART II)
S: EXT. ROCK ARCH
N: Guy is still on his knees.
C: GUY
D: Wow. You're really strong.
E: in pain, defeated
N: The flame DWINDLES. Guy MOVES toward it. Eep BLOCKS him.
C: EEP
D: No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it!
N: No way Guy is getting past her.
C: GUY
D: It's dying. I can fix it!
N: Eep doesn't want to.
C: GUY
D: Please. I hate the dark.
E: CONT'D
N: Eep sees a kindred spirit. She gets out of his way. Guy PICKS UP the torch and BLOWS. Eep scoots closer to Guy, staying in the circle of light around him. As Guy brings the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar to Eep. This boy seems to have power over light itself. Eep is smitten.
C: EEP
D: It does what you tell it?
C: GUY
D: Well, yeah, sort of.
C: EEP
D: The sun?
C: GUY
D: No, no. Fire.
C: EEP
D: Hi, fire.
E: to the flame
C: GUY
D: It's not alive.
E: LAUGHING
C: EEP
D: But you said it was dying.
C: GUY
D: Uh sorry,--
C: EEP
D: It comes from where you come from?
C: GUY
D: No. I make it.
N: Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair.
C: EEP
D: Make some for me.
C: GUY
D: Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me.
C: EEP
D: Make. MAKE! MAKE IT!
N: Eep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste.
C: GUY
D: You do this a lot.
N: Something CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken.
C: EEP
D: Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead?
N: Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS upright.
C: GUY
D: Hey, those are cold!
C: BELT
D: Squirf!
C: GUY
D: You think? Listening shells, activate.
N: Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.
C: GUY
D: I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately. He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an anchor.
E: CONT'D
C: EEP
D: I don't even know you.
C: GUY
D: Ow. I'm Guy.
E: pained, rushed
C: EEP
D: Guy?
C: GUY
D: And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up.
C: BELT
D: Hhiiyaa! Yaaa!
C: EEP
D: What are "pants up?"
C: GUY
D: Who are you?
C: EEP
D: Eep.
C: GUY
D: Let me clarify, Eep. The world is ending.
E: cutting her off
C: EEP
D: What?
C: GUY
D: I'm calling it... The... End.
E: VERY DRAMATIC
C: BELT
D: Da da daaaaa.
C: EEP
D: How do you know?
N: Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da daaaa. It seems very important to them.
C: GUY
D: I've seen it. It's coming this way. First, the Earth is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in. Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone.
N: Again with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep.
C: GUY
D: We've got to get to high ground. I know a mountain, that way--
E: CONT'D
N: He points into the distance.
C: GUY
D: It's our only chance. Come with me.
E: CONT'D extending his hand
N: Guy and Belt reach out their hands to Eep.
C: EEP
D: I can't.
N: Guy hands the shell to Eep. And Eep is mesmerized. Guy pulls his hog-mask back down.
C: GUY
D: Okay. Here. If you survive, call me.
N: Eep test-blows the shell. It makes a sound, she giggles. When she looks up to thank Guy, he is GONE.
C: EEP
D: Thank you. Hello? Hey!
N: Eep BUMPS directly into Grug.
C: EEP
D: Dad!
E: CONT'D
C: GRUG
D: Are you hurt? What took you?

C: EEP
D: Dad, let me explain...
N: A low GROWL interrupts them. ON THE BEAR OWL Sniffing around. It passes over a log. CRANE DOWN to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one hand, Eep dangling in the other.

C: UGGA
D: Eep!
C: EEP
D: Mom!
C: UGGA
D: Grug! What happened!?
C: GRUG
D: You know what, I am so mad right now, that I can't talk to her.
C: UGGA
D: Eep?
C: EEP
D: You'll never believe it. I found something new.
C: CROODS
D: New?!!!! The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive circle.
C: GRUG
D: New's a big problem!
N: Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation. She SQUEEZES out.
C: EEP
D: Wait. Wait!
C: UGGA
D: Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
C: EEP
D: It wasn't bad.
C: GRUG

C: EEP
D: No. He was nice.
C: GRUG
D: What!? Excuse me? He?
C: EEP
D: Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
C: GRAN
D: Strange. Usually it's the reverse.
N: Grug RAISES an eyebrow.
C: THUNK
D: Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy hog!
N: Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head.
C: EEP
D: There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him.
N: Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the sound ALARMS the Croods. They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with their rocks. Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods are satisfied the object is gone.
C: EEP
D: What is wrong with you?
E: CONT'D
C: GRUG
D: It was dangerous.
C: EEP
D: It was beautiful. You want to see dangerous? Here.
E: VERY ANGRY
N: She pelts Thunk with a rock.
C: THUNK
D: Owww! My sniffer!
C: GRUG
D: Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!
C: EEP
D: What!? You can't keep me inside forever!
N: Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust. CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground. Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack starts to splinter under their feet.
C: EEP
D: He said this would happen.
E: CONT'D
N: Then BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE!
C: GRUG
D: Get to the cave! GO!
N: The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, heading towards the safety of their cave. The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave.
C: GRUG
D: Look out! Stop!
E: CONT'D
N: Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from the mass of rocks crashing down. The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth settles.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball, covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered and safe under his mighty arms.
C: GRUG
D: Is everyone okay?
E: CONT'D
C: UGGA
D: Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone.
N: Grug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone.
C: GRUG
D: No.
N: Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two. He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he lowers his head. As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face-- As the dust descends, Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond.
C: EEP
D: You really need to see this...
N: The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful world. The Croods look out at the new world.
C: EEP
D: We should go there!
E: CONT'D
C: GRUG
D: No. No one is going anywhere.
N: Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice.
C: GRUG
D: What else did that boy say?
E: CONT'D
N: WHOOSH! Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE. The Croods reel back as it sails overhead. They turn to watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away. They hear a familiar menacing growl. It's the BEAR OWL! It roars and charges toward the Croods. Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in front of his family. The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like a ball of yarn. But the Croods are not behind it. They are running towards the New World.
C: UGGA
D: Grug?
C: GRUG
D: Just go! Go! Go!
N: The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl closing in. They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives. The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin tumbling down a steep jungle hill.
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 776 - NEW WORLD
S: EXT. NEW WORLD. DAY
N: The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots and strange plants and land in a heap. They all lie on their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm. Grug sits up first. He turns to the high, high, cliff above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their lives up to this moment. A few loose pebbles continue to tumble down. There is no sign of the BEAR OWL. The others stand up, and they take in this new place. Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts:
C: GRUG
D: One, two, three, four, five -- BEAT. Grug smiles.
N: Gran lands in a heap behind him.

C: SANDY
D: Sniff sniff sniff Grrrrrrrrrrr.....
C: UGGA
D: Sandy? What is it?
E: hushed, urgent
N: Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a bush. Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back like a dog on a leash.
C: GRUG
D: No, no! Come back, Sandy!
N: Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the bush and scurry away.

E: CONT'D TENSE WHISPER
N: They start moving.

E: RAMBLING MORE
C: THUNK
D: If it was me, I'm just throwing this out there, if it was me choosing the cave, I would go with a smaller cave.
E: CONT'D
N: As they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH MONKEYS) watch these foreigners. In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out. But in the back Eep is taking in the wonders. They pass through a curtain of hefty hanging pears. After they pass the "pears" all turn to watch the Croods. A leaf FLUTTERS down.
C: GRUG
D: Wait.
N: Eep and Grug LOOK UP. WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH MONKEYS.
C: THUNK
D: Dad?
C: GRUG

N: Grug launches into his Threat Display -
C: GRUG
D: WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!
E: CONT'D
N: He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the nearest Punch Monkey. No reaction from the Punch Monkey. Grug stops, confused... The Punch Monkey now breaks into a BROAD GRIN... Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in the face! Grug reels back, surprised - turns... Right into another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! -
C: THUNK
D: Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you got em-- Now they're really hitting you. Dad I got it, just stop running into their fists.
N: Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose.
C: GRAN
D: Hah, I'm loving this.
C: UGGA
D: Grug, when you're done, we should get going.
N: Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun! The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away for no apparent reason. Grug staggers backwards into the family.
C: GRUG
D: That's right! You can't get past this!
C: CHUNKY
D: ROOOAR!
N: A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the rock and SPRINGS! -
C: CROODS
D: GASPS
C: GRUG
D: Climb! Climb! Climb!
N: Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal. GRUG'S POV: A cave!
C: GRUG
D: CAVE! GO! GO!
E: CONT'D
N: The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to the cave.
C: GRUG
D: Come on! Hurry up, let's go! Come on!
E: CONT'D
N: The Croods all RUN LIKE CRAZY in the direction Grug pointed. They step inside the "cave." SLAM! The front of the cave comes down. The Croods have jumped inside the MOUTH of a LAND WHALE!
C: THUNK
D: Hey look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 1250 - GUY TO THE RESCUE The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out through its blow hole. The Croods land in a heap.

C: GRAN
D: And seven... if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
C: CHUNKY
D: Grrrrrrrrr.
N: The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass. It looks at the Croods with delight. Suddenly, the shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore. It freaks out and retreats into the forest.
C: THUNK
D: Hah! It's scared of the dark... wait... we're scared of the dark.
N: And for good reason, because as the SHADOW from the setting sun falls across the Croods. Suddenly, thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating cloud above them. It's a beautiful sight. The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND WHALE. Moments later, they fly back into the air - the whale is SKELETONIZED. It CRUMPLES to the ground.
C: GRUG
D: Kill circle!
N: The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing rocks. Eep spies a SKULL lying in the sand. She SPRINTS for it.
C: GRUG
D: Eep! Eeeep!
E: CONT'D
N: Eep breaks a horn from the skull and BLOWS on it loud and long. ON GUY hearing the horn. He is happy to hear the sound, knowing it's Eep calling him. Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices the circling birds in the sky. Alarmed, he DASHES off. Guy appears at the treeline. He spots Eep standing alone in the clearing. He sees the birds heading towards her. He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK. Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out of Eep's hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the remaining light. All goes BLACK. Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy. He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it, and it FLARES UP! The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds like a knife. For a few moments the Croods are inside a TORNADO of the tiny monsters. The mass PASSES. Grug SLAPS at one last smoldering bird FLUTTERING past. Grug TURNS to see Guy, HOLDING his daughter. Grug's expression DARKENS. He SNARLS.
C: GUY
D: Ta-da.
C: EEP
E: Sigh.
N: Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.

E: O.S.
C: GRUG
D: Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it wants.
N: As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:
C: GRUG
D: Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll find a new cave, and pretend today never happened.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: GRUG
D: Isn't this fun, Eep?
E: CONT'D looks at the fire
N: Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy.
C: GRUG
D: Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows where he's been.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch. She shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE.
C: THUNK
D: Dad, Sandy's hurting fire.
N: Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. (NOTE: From this point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she struggles, kicks and bites.)
C: GRUG
D: Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!
C: UGGA
D: Aww, what a cute little guy.

N: One of the embers has caught onto Thunk's tunic.
C: THUNK
D: It likes me! Hey! IT'S BITING ME!!
E: after a beat
N: Thunk takes off running like a maniac. The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires in the grass around him. Grug looks at the growing fires with utter confusion.
C: THUNK
D: Ow! You're not my friend. Stop, stop touching me!
E: CONT'D SCREAMING
C: GRUG
D: Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass!
N: Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring of fire blazes up.
C: THUNK
D: Stop please, please. I'm only nine.
E: pleading with fire
N: Gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she realizes her WALKING STICK IS ON FIRE. Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick on the ground, trying to put it out. But she only ends up making more small fires.
C: UGGA
D: Ooh, more fire babies.
N: While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to grow in size.

N: Ugga carries a REDWOOD above her head and then tosses it onto the small fire.
C: UGGA
D: Eat up, babies!
N: WHOOSH! Ugga ignites a massive bonfire. The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic pyromaniacs. CLOSE ON GRAN Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground. PULL BACK TO REVEAL - she is standing on the edge of a giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire.

S: EXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON
N: Guy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes. He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the tree. Eep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top down to the ground.

N: In their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish. It CHARGES. Eep and Guy don't notice. The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it.
C: EEP
D: Uh... It didn't step in your trap-y, thing.
E: CONT'D
C: GUY
D: Yeah, I noticed.
N: Eep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird. The Turkey Fish grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field. He goes flying through the air, screaming. ON GRUG - hearing the commotion. Guy lands back in the log.
C: GRUG
D: Where's Eep?
N: Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.
C: GUY

N: Grug STEPS FORWARD. He's going to SPRING the trap.
C: GRUG
D: Eep!
C: EEP
D: Dad, no!
N: She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN. The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a couple hundred feet up... ... and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.

C: THUNK
D: It's an avalanche of flavor.
N: THE CROODS are eating like wild animals. They practically MAUL each other for scraps. HOWLS and SNARLING fill the night air. Guy is amazed and shocked at how the Croods are wolfing it down. Guy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock. Guy and Belt share a concerned LOOK as they politely eat their meal. Eep comes over and sits next to Guy.

C: THUNK
D: Yeah a story, tell us a story!
N: Croods gather around Grug.
C: GRUG
D: Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
C: THUNK
D: So easy to remember!
C: GRUG
D: I know! But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway.
C: CROODS
D: No!
C: GRUG
D: Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end.
C: GUY
D: Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist ending. My stories never end like that.
C: THUNK
D: Yes! Two stories in one night!
N: The Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is uncharacteristically dumbstruck. A BEAT -
C: GUY
D: Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's. Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave with the rest of her family. Her father and mother told her, "You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
C: GRUG
D: And die. Good story.
N: Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up. As Guy begins talking again they settle back down.
C: GUY
D: But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. She leaned out to touch it, and slipped.
C: GRUG
D: And she fell.
C: GUY
D: And she flew.
C: CROODS
D: GASP
C: THUNK
D: Where did she fly?

C: GRUG
D: Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!
C: GUY
D: Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's where I'm going.
N: Grug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced. Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled.
C: GRUG
D: Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep. And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want.
C: EEP
D: Tomorrow?!

N: Morning light kisses Grug's cheeks. He's sound asleep. PULL OUT to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a cliff edge - there was another subduction during the night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk two hundred feet. Grug is still grasping Guy's log, which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still- asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end. In the nick of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end. Guy WAKES UP, looking down.

C: GUY
D: That was too close. It almost caught us.

C: GUY
D: Ow, ow, ow.
N: Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. He looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the field and feels pity for Eep.
C: THUNK
D: Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow! Do not walk on your hands, the hands do not help at all.
N: Guy looks back at the stranded Croods. Then he looks again to the tall mountain. Belt sees that Guy is having a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a choice. Belt makes it for him.

ON THE CROODS Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse waiting for his Croods dinner. Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks. Traveling by stilts over a crevasse. The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts. Guy helps Eep from falling.

N: Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him. Grug WHACKS Chunky in the face with a stilt. Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on, then WHACKS a chunk out of them. Grug DROPS down by a yard or so. Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm, losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunky's paw. Grug doesn't make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds emanate from the canyon.

D: Ooowwwww!
E: CONT'D
N: The Croods stand at the top of a cliff. Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging to the side. Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves, sledding down the side of the canyon past Grug. They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by tiptoeing. Grug stumbles and falls down the slope.

She begins to SWIM. Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is building. The Croods ALL JUMP at once. Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug!
C: GRUG
D: Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool. Not cool.
N: Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans. Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to the bottom. ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant. A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous.

Eep PICKS UP the flower, puts it in her hair, then finds a more flowers dropped on her path. She playfully begins hunting for Guy. Guy and Belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers in Eep's path. Grug POPS out of a passageway - he's back where he began. He chooses another tunnel. Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove - the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant. Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto Eep's path.
