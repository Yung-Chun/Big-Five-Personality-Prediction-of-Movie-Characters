S: INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT
N: Pitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices. NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted.
C: DANIEL
D: Turn on the flashlight.
E: whispering
C: JULIEN
D: I'm trying. It doesn't work.
C: DANIEL
D: It has to work. You just bought it this afternoon.
N: A beat.
C: JULIEN
D: Do they come with batteries?
C: DANIEL
D: You didn't buy batteries?
C: JULIEN
D: I thought they came with batteries.
C: DANIEL
D: I can't believe you didn't check.
C: JULIEN
D: I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
C: DANIEL
D: Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
S: EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits nervously.
S: INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT
N: Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's, tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame. Daniel rolls up the canvas.
C: DANIEL
D: Let's go.
N: Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.
C: DANIEL
D: Be careful it's...
N: Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.
C: DANIEL
D: ... hot!
N: Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief. Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat. Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.
S: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
N: A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.
S: INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT
N: Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.
C: DANIEL
D: Light your lighter. I can't see anything... and try not to burn down the house!
N: Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.
C: OLD MAN'S VOICE
D: Don't move!
N: They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a very long, double-barrel shotgun. Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom. Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the floor, motionless.
C: JULIEN
D: Is he dead?
C: DANIEL
D: I don't know. He looks dead.
C: JULIEN
D: He looked dead before he fell.
N: The old man groans, then opens his eyes. He grabs his shotgun. Daniel and Julien run to the door.
S: EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: Daniel and Julien run towards the street.
C: DANIEL
D: Start the car! Start the car!
N: Raymond starts the engine. Daniel and Julien rush across the street and get in the back seat. Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.
S: INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS
N: Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.
C: JULIEN
D: You didn't think to move the car before we came out!
N: Daniel looks out his window and sees... DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun and heads towards the car. Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the car shatter.
C: DANIEL
D: Raymond, get us out of here!
N: Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man opens the breach of the shotgun to reload.. Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake. The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.
S: INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHT
N: Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives. Julien finds the whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.
C: DANIEL
D: You know what makes a good get away driver?
E: to Raymond More
N: DANIEL (Cont'd) (controlled anger) Being able to get away!
C: RAYMOND
D: You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
C: JULIEN
D: Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you on how well you fucked up tonight.
S: EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY
N: A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.
S: INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter. As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring at him.
C: MARCEL
D: I heard you almost got your ass blown off last night. Some thief. A regular black panther.
E: amused
N: Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.
C: RAYMOND
D: A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
C: MARCEL
D: Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
C: RAYMOND
D: There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
C: MARCEL
D: What the hell is he talking about?
C: RAYMOND
D: I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
C: MARCEL
D: How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
C: BASTALDI
D: Shut up! Both of you! You're giving me a fuckin' headache.
N: A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another. We HEAR a muffled GROANING SOUND in the b.g.
C: DANIEL
D: Where's your brother?
C: BASTALDI
D: Vincent's in the States on business. That it?
E: a beat; referring to the painting
N: Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk. Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art, just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.
C: BASTALDI
D: Okay. Now I've got something I want to --
N: We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.
C: BASTALDI
D: Do you mind? I'm trying to do some business here.
N: The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles something.
C: BASTALDI
D: One more sound out of you and I'm going to cut your fuckin' tongue out.
N: Bastaldi closes the door. Daniel looks at him inquisitively.
C: BASTALDI
D: You take someone in. Give them a steady job and how do they repay you? By claiming to misplace a shipment of your merchandise.
C: RAYMOND
D: Maybe he did misplace it.
C: BASTALDI
D: You misplace your car keys. You misplace your cell phone.
E: More
N: BASTALDI (Cont'd) You do not misplace one hundred and forty seven wide-screen TV's!
C: DANIEL
D: Laurant, how long has he been in there?
N: Bastaldi looks puzzled.
C: BASTALDI
D: I don't know. What day is today?
C: JULIEN
D: Thursday.
C: BASTALDI
D: Is it Thursday already? This week has just shot by.
N: Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...
C: BASTALDI
D: You and your crew speak English, don't you?
N: Daniel is still staring at the closet.
C: BASTALDI
D: Hey Daniel! Hello? Do you guys speak English?
E: snaps his fingers
C: DANIEL
D: Uh, yeah.
C: BASTALDI
D: Good. I have a job for you in America.
N: Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple. He points to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.
C: BASTALDI
D: The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich. An acquaintance of mine recently quit working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant. She tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom.
C: JULIEN
D: It seems like a long way to go for a necklace.
C: DANIEL
D: Besides, we don't know the city and--
C: MARCEL
D: Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go.
E: overlapping More
N: MARCEL (Cont'd) He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
C: BASTALDI
D: Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
C: DANIEL
D: C'mon, Laurant, America?
C: BASTALDI
D: The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
N: They know they don't have a choice.
C: JULIEN
D: We're going to need to find someone who knows the city.
C: MARCEL
D: I know someone.
S: EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY
N: The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler, dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet. Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up. Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence. The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets. He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees... HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA: of two police officers moving towards him . He knows he has no more time. He takes off running, disappearing into the crowd.
S: INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY
N: Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile. NOTE: All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted.
C: MARCEL
D: Going somewhere?
C: SAMI
D: Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
N: A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.
C: SAMI
D: You're probably here for the money I owe you. I don't have it. Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside.
E: off Marcel's nod
S: INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY
N: Marcel closes the door. He is face to face with Sami.
C: SAMI
D: You know this is how rumors get started.
N: Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning of a sexual act.
C: SAMI
D: Told you.
N: Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to his feet.
C: MARCEL
D: Today's your lucky day, Sami.
C: SAMI
D: Yeah, I can see that.
E: breathlessly
C: MARCEL
D: Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
C: SAMI
D: Me?
C: MARCEL
D: You lived there. You know the city.
C: SAMI
D: I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
N: Marcel glares at him.
C: SAMI
D: But I'd be... I'd be happy to go.
E: nervously
N: Marcel stares at him with hard expression.
C: MARCEL
D: If you try to leave town I'll know. If you manage to leave town I'll find you... and the next time we meet in a bathroom I'll be cutting you up into little pieces.
N: He hands Sami a piece of paper.
C: MARCEL
D: Be at this address at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.
S: INT. CAFE -- MORNING
N: Daniel sits with Julien. At the end of the bar Raymond is on the pay phone.
C: RAYMOND
D: Yes, Mama. Yes, I have my vitamins. I have everything. Of course I'm coming back. I'm not leaving you. I'm only going to be gone a few days. I'll call you when I get there. Okay? I've got to go now. Mama, I've got to go. No, I'm not yelling.
E: in French listens listens
N: Sami enters and walks over to Daniel and Julien.
C: SAMI
D: I'm Sami. Marcel sent me.
C: JULIEN
D: What is it you do, Sami?
C: SAMI
D: You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
C: JULIEN
D: I see. A master criminal.
C: SAMI
D: Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
N: The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is 40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to Daniel. Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over.
C: DANIEL
D: This is Zero.
E: to Sami
C: SAMI
D: Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
N: Sami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and leads him away from the others.
C: JULIEN
D: Let me give you some advice. You don't want to piss him off because he'll kill you for the fun of it. What you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you.
C: ZERO
D: So, we are going to America?
E: in French
C: DANIEL
D: In English. Sami doesn't speak French.
C: ZERO
D: Where are you from?
C: SAMI
D: Algeria.
C: ZERO
D: And you don't speak French?
C: SAMI
D: Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
C: ZERO
D: -- Zero isn't interested in your life story. Who gets killed?
E: overlapping to Daniel
C: DANIEL
D: Hopefully no one.
C: ZERO
D: No one? Then why is Zero here?
E: confused
N: Sami leans over to Raymond.
C: SAMI
D: He speaks about himself in the third person?
C: RAYMOND
D: Feel free to correct him if you want.
C: DANIEL
D: I just want you there in case there's trouble.
E: to Zero
C: ZERO
D: And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
C: DANIEL
D: We'll see.
S: EXT. CAFE -- DAY
N: Daniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases. The door to a limousine opens and Marcel gets out. The scene is in FRENCH.
C: BASTALDI
D: I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
E: to Daniel
C: DANIEL
D: What?
C: BASTALDI
D: This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
C: DANIEL
D: You don't trust me?
C: BASTALDI
D: I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
S: INT. LIMO -- MOVING -- DAY
N: For many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside a limo. Julien pours himself a drink. Sami plays around with the air conditioner. Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, "Que je taime."
C: MARCEL
D: That's better.
N: Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday. Bastaldi has had enough.
C: BASTALDI
D: Stop it! Both of you!
N: He turns off the radio. A long beat. Marcel, like a child who has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but loud enough for Zero to hear.
C: MARCEL
D: ... que je t'aime... que je... Marcel sees Bastaldi glaring at him and stops.
E: singing
S: EXT. O'HARE AIRPORT -- MORNING
N: Daniel and the crew get into a mini-van taxi.
S: EXT. CHICAGO DRIVING MONTAGE -- MORNING
N: Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building. Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are in...
S: EXT. STREET -- MORNING
N: An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Are you sure you guys have the right address? This ain't no tourist area.
N: Marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding.
C: MARCEL
D: Yes. We are sure.
N: The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of the suitcases.
C: SAMI
D: Let me handle this.
N: LAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward.
C: SAMI
D: Hey, brother. What's happening, man?
N: Sami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar.
C: LAMAR
D: Don't you brother me, motherfucker.
N: Sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air. He casually lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins.
C: LAMAR
D: What's in the bags?
C: JULIEN
D: Dirty underwear.
N: Lamar forces a laugh.
C: LAMAR
D: Dirty underwear. That's a good one. Let me explain something to you. This is my street and you're gonna give me want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads open.
N: Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm.
C: RAYMOND
D: Lamar, violence is never an answer to settling disputes. I can see you have a lot of anger... but this is not the way to get it out.
C: LAMAR
D: Get outta my face!
N: Lamar removes a knife. The others in his group bring out an assortment of clubs, chains and pipes.
C: LAMAR
D: Now, are you going to give me the suitcases? Or are we going to have to take them?
N: Zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases.
C: ZERO
D: Va te faire foutre!
C: LAMAR
D: What did he say?
C: DANIEL
D: He said to go fuck yourself.
C: ZERO
D: We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
C: LAMAR
D: Who is Zero?
C: JULIEN
D: He is.
C: LAMAR
D: He speaks about himself in the third person?
E: to Julien
N: Julien shrugs his shoulders.
C: LAMAR
D: Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass and take my knife from me?
C: ZERO
D: If you insist.
N: Zero stands up and raises his hand. He is holding a .9mm Glock. He aims it at Lamar's head. Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away. Zero aims the gun at his groin.
C: ZERO
D: Leave now before Zero shoots off those little raisins you call balls.
N: Lamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick up their bags and walk towards a building. Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief.
C: SAMI
D: You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
C: ZERO
D: Zero did not put it in his bag. He put it in yours.
N: Zero grins and walks away.
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MORNING
N: The crew stands at a door. Marcel knocks. A peep-hole in the door is opened and an eye looks them over.
C: MARCEL
D: We are looking for Sophie. Laurant send us.
N: The door is opened by SOPHIE (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's computer). She is late 20's, beautiful.
C: SAMI
D: Ouh La La.
E: softly
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING
N: An old building, the rooms are partitioned off by sheets hanging from the ceiling. The main area is an artists workspace where large abstract paintings lean against the wall.
C: SOPHIE
D: I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
C: SAMI
D: Thanks.
N: Of to the side, sitting on the couch is WAYNE, 20's, a burn-out with long hair and a scraggly goatee. His face is buried in a bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana. He watches a cartoon show on the television.
C: SOPHIE
D: This is Wayne. My roommate.
E: to all of them
N: Raymond walks over to him.
C: RAYMOND
D: I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
C: WAYNE
D: No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
E: offers him the bong
C: RAYMOND
D: No thank you.
N: Raymond looks at the television and sees a cartoon show.
C: RAYMOND
D: Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
C: WAYNE
D: Yeah, I dig him.
C: RAYMOND
D: Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
N: Wayne stares at him with a dead pan expression as he tries to assemble a coherent thought.
C: WAYNE
D: Whoa... That's deep.
C: SOPHIE
D: You guys hungry?
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP -- AFTERNOON
N: Because of the hour the room is not crowded. Only a few PEOPLE sit at the counter sipping coffee. A WAITRESS, 50's, bee hive hair style, face covered in make up arrives at the table.
C: WAITRESS
D: Ready to order?
N: Julien looks up at her.
C: JULIEN
D: Could we see a wine list please?
C: WAITRESS
D: That's cute.
E: smirks
C: SOPHIE
D: They don't have a wine list.
C: JULIEN
D: Oh, then we will have the house wine.
C: WAITRESS
D: Sure -- and would you like that before your escargot in white truffle sauce?
C: JULIEN
D: I did not order escargot.
C: SAMI
D: They don't serve wine here.
C: JULIEN
D: What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
C: SAMI
D: This kind.
C: JULIEN
D: Okay. I will have a beer.
C: WAITRESS
D: I don't think he's grasping the concept. Iced tea, lemonade, coca cola, sprite or root beer.
C: JULIEN
D: C'est quoi root beer?
E: to the others
C: DANIEL
D: He'll have a sprite. We'll all have sprite.
C: WAITRESS
D: Good. Now that we've gotten the beverage selection out of the way, dare we move on to the main course?
C: ZERO
D: Idiot.
N: Zero grins as he puts a cigarette in his mouth. The waitress pulls it out of his mouth.
C: WAITRESS
D: And no smoking.
C: ZERO
D: No smoking? No drinking? What kind of country is this?
E: in French
T: CUT TO:
C: CLOSE ON MAN'S FACE.
D: VINNY, 40's, not the brightest bulb on the tree. His head snaps back as someone punches him in the face. Blood flows from his nose. We are in...
S: EXT. ALLEY -- AFTERNOON
N: Two GANGSTERS stand on each side of Vinny. They are JOEY "TWO TONS" 40's, could have a second career as a Sumo Wrestler. NICKY "THE RAKE", 30's, thin a rail. They make a strange pair but they both have one thing in common: They are stone cold killers. Standing in front of the them is FRANKIE ZAMMITO, 30's, a wise guy, tough as they come. He wears a well tailored suit, black leather gloves and polished shoes.
C: VINNY
D: I'm sorry, Frankie. Really.
E: frightened
N: Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito.
C: ZAMMITO
D: You bleed on me, I'll kill ya.
N: Vinny takes a step back.
C: ZAMMITO
D: What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? What'd I say to him?
E: to Joey
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: You said don't do it, boss.
C: ZAMMITO
D: That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
C: VINNY
D: Frankie, I --
C: ZAMMITO
D: -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. Break his arm.
E: to Joey and Nicky
N: Vinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes.
C: VINNY
D: Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
C: ZAMMITO
D: That's why we're only breaking one arm.
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- AFTERNOON
N: The table is littered with plates. Sophie has sketched out a diagram of a house on her napkin.
C: SOPHIE
D: There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
C: JULIEN
D: I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
C: SAMI
D: After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
C: DANIEL
D: Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
E: impressed
C: JULIEN
D: What about transportation?
C: SOPHIE
D: You can use my car.
C: DANIEL
D: Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
C: RAYMOND
D: No problem.
C: SAMI
D: When do we go?
C: SOPHIE
D: Tonight.
C: DANIEL
D: Tonight?
C: SOPHIE
D: I know they won't be home tonight.
C: SAMI
D: You ever hear of jet lag?
C: SOPHIE
D: Take a nap.
S: EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
N: As they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar of loud MUSIC.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
N: As the enter the music is even louder. The bass pounds through the walls. Wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch smoking a joint.
C: JULIEN
D: What the hell is that?
C: WAYNE
D: Neighbors. They do this all the time.
C: SAMI
D: I can't even hear myself think.
C: ZERO
D: How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
C: SOPHIE
D: I've asked them a hundred times to keep in down. They don't listen.
C: RAYMOND
D: I will talk to them.
N: Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing.
C: WAYNE
D: Yeah. Right.
C: SOPHIE
D: Not a good idea.
C: RAYMOND
D: It's just a matter of communication.
N: Raymond leaves.
S: EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
N: Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE. Behind him are two other rough-looking men.
C: RAYMOND
D: Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting next door and I was wondering if you could make your music a little less loud.
E: cheerfully; loudly over the music
N: The Biker takes a sip of his beer.
C: BIKER
D: No.
C: RAYMOND
D: But the music is very--
N: Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer over Raymond's head.
C: BIKER
D: Fuck off!
N: He slams the door in Raymond's face.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON
N: The music continues to pound through the walls. A soggy Raymond steps into the room. He walks over to a chair and sits down, his head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room.
S: EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON
N: Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves. He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat. The Biker opens the door.
C: BIKER
D: Listen asshole, I told you --
N: Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose. Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.
S: INT. BIKER'S WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
N: On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a large glass coffee table. BIKER #2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel turns around. Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers fists slams into the hard crown of his skull. BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over. Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around and down on his knees. In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head . BIKER #2 falls face forwards and is out cold. Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns off the power. DEAD QUIET.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON
N: Marcel enters. Wayne is on the couch with Raymond.
C: WAYNE

D: -- Super what?

D: Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.

D: You like shoes?
C: SAMI
D: No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
C: SOPHIE
D: It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
N: Sami dumps the rest of the shoes out of the bag.
C: SOPHIE
D: So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
C: SAMI
D: Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
C: SOPHIE
D: The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
C: SAMI
D: So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
C: SOPHIE
D: They're not nice people.
N: She sees a TATTOO on Sami's arm. It's a heart with someone's faded name.
C: SOPHIE
D: I like your tattoo.
N: Sami is suddenly self-conscious of it. She traces along the letters with her finger.
C: SOPHIE
D: Casandra. Old girlfriend?
E: reading the name
C: SAMI
D: Something like that.
C: SOPHIE
D: Did she break your heart?

C: SOPHIE
D: It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
C: SAMI
D: You ask a lot of questions.
C: SOPHIE
D: That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
C: SAMI
D: I don't remember. I was drunk.
C: SOPHIE
D: You got it in a bar?
C: SAMI
D: No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
C: SOPHIE
D: Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
C: SAMI
D: It's okay. It was a long time ago.
C: SOPHIE
D: I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
N: Sami looks at her quizzically.
C: SAMI
D: Who's gonna see it there?
C: SOPHIE
D: The lucky ones.
N: She smiles flirtatiously and walks away.
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE -- EVENING
N: A car drives up. We can only see the outline of an old Chevy Impala. Two men get out of the car, leaving the engine running as they head for the liquor store. Across the street Raymond is checking out a Buick LaSabre, but stops when he sees the flashing alarm light on the dashboard. He looks across the street and sees the Impala.

N: Joey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under the covers. We hear a loud scream on the phone.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: That's right baby, give it to papa Joey.
N: He is really deep into his fantasy world when...
C: JOEY "TWO TONS" WIFE
D: Joey, who is that?
N: Joey sits up quickly.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: -- And don't call here again, you pervert.
E: loudly; for his wife's sake
N: He slams the phone down. A long beat. It rings again. This time he checks his caller ID and sees that call is coming from Zammito's house.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Yeah boss?
N: Again we hear the same muffled cries.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Boss?
S: INT. BODY SHOP -- NIGHT
N: Raphael enters with Hector and two GANG-BANGERS. The room is filled with low rider cars. Working under the hood of a car is FELIX, 30's, sleazy. Raphael walks over and slams the hood down, pinning Felix's upper body and squishing his face between the hood and engine.
C: RAPHAEL
D: Someone stole my car tonight!
C: FELIX
D: C'mon Raphael, you don't think that I would steal your car?
C: RAPHAEL
D: You run a chop shop for low riders. Yes, I think you'd steal my car.
N: Raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on Felix again.
C: FELIX
D: I swear I didn't. I wouldn't!
C: RAPHAEL
D: And I should just believe--
C: HECTOR
D: -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
E: overlapping; to Felix
C: RAPHAEL
D: Hector, don't interrupt me.
E: to Hector
C: HECTOR
D: He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
C: RAPHAEL
D: I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
N: Hector is embarrassed as Raphael once again berates him in front of the others. Raphael picks up a pair of pliers of the workbench. He clamps them down on the tip of Felix's nose and squeezes. Felix's face fills with pain.
C: RAPHAEL
D: If I find out you're lying. If I find out you know anything about this I'm going to come back and cut off your nose.
N: He gives the pliers one last squeeze, then releases Felix.
C: RAPHAEL
D: Vamos.
E: to the others
S: INT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: Agent Hadley sips a cup of warm coffee. He looks very concerned.
C: FBI AGENT
D: Sir, do you think we could have a hostage situation in there?
N: Agent Hadley is about to answer when he sees something. HIS POV -- of a Lincoln Town Car pull up. Joey "Two Tons" gets out, goes to the front door and enters.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Hold on a second. Joey "Two Tons" just pulled up.
S: INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: Joey enters to find Zammito tied to the chair, face down on the bed.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Jesus, Boss!
S: INT. ZAMMITO'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
N: Zammito stands behind the bar pouring himself a large scotch.
C: ZAMMITO
D: They were all French guys.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: French guys? You mean like from France?
C: ZAMMITO
D: Yeah, French guys from France.
E: with strained patience
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: What'd they take?
C: ZAMMITO
D: Everything.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Everything?
C: ZAMMITO
D: Everything.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Boy, you must be pissed.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
C: ZAMMITO
D: You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Okay boss. Where are they?
C: ZAMMITO
D: If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
C: ZAMMITO
D: Just find them!
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Okay boss.
N: Zammito stares at Joey for a long beat, then...
C: ZAMMITO
D: Papa Joey?
N: Joey looks away, embarrassed.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
N: Sami can't sleep. He walks over to the table and sorts through the canvas bag containing the contents of Zammito's safe. Inside a small cardboard box he finds several cassette tapes. He removes the box and walks to the stereo system on the floor, then inserts a tape into the cassette deck. A moment later Sophie enters.
C: SOPHIE
D: Can't sleep?
C: SAMI
D: No.
C: SOPHIE
D: I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
C: SAMI
D: It's not your fault.
N: She notices the box of tapes.
C: SOPHIE
D: What are you doing?
C: SAMI
D: I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
C: SOPHIE
D: Sounds boring.
C: SAMI
D: It's three in the morning. Not much else to do.
N: She grins seductively, then leans in towards him.
C: SOPHIE
D: I can think of something. They kiss.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING
N: Sami is asleep on the floor, curled up under several blankets. He wakes up and looks to his side expecting to find Sophie. She is not there. Sami looks around for her. Wayne is sitting on the couch preparing his morning joint.
C: WAYNE
D: She's not here, man.
C: SAMI
D: Where is she?
C: WAYNE
D: I think she went to do some laundry. Threw some stuff in a bag and left.
N: It takes a moment for Sami to connect the thoughts.
C: SAMI
D: Bag? Sami runs to the table. The black canvas bag is gone. CLOSE ON DANIEL: Asleep. Sami shakes him. He opens his eyes.
C: SAMI
D: Get up. We've been ripped off!
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
N: Daniel and Sami are with the crew. They are not a happy bunch. Wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television.
C: JULIEN
D: Oh, man... this is bullshit! You can't trust anyone these days.
C: RAYMOND
D: She took everything! Didn't even leave us cab fare.
N: A thought occurs to Sami.
C: SAMI
D: Not everything.
N: He removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before Sophie entered.
C: SAMI
D: I was going to listen to it last night but I --
N: He realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened.
C: SAMI
D: -- feel asleep.
N: Wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh.
C: WAYNE
D: No you didn't, dude. You were bangin' Sophie. I saw you guys going at it.
C: DANIEL
D: You slept with her?
C: SAMI
D: Well, actually I would say she slept with me.
N: Daniel stares at him angrily.
C: SAMI
D: What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
C: DANIEL
D: You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
C: SAMI
D: No. Chicks dig me.
N: Daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player. On the tape we hear a phone ringing.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Hello?
C: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
D: It's me. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here. We're talking about a boss.
N: Sami is the first to realize what he is hearing.
C: SAMI
D: Holy shit.
C: RAYMOND
D: What?
N: Sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the rest.
C: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
D: Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The old ways are gone. If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out. I need to know if I can count on your support?
N: A pause on the line.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Yeah.
N: The line goes dead. Sami leans back.
C: SAMI
D: No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
C: JULIEN
D: This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
C: MARCEL
D: The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
C: DANIEL
D: You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
C: JULIEN
D: I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
C: SAMI
D: Yeah, but you did do it. So let's deal with that.
C: MARCEL
D: What are you guys so scared of? Zammito doesn't know who we are. We just get out of town and it's over.
C: ZERO
D: Oh, you think it's that easy?
C: RAYMOND
D: Yeah. We just go home.
C: DANIEL
D: We can't.
C: RAYMOND
D: I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
C: SAMI
D: They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
C: DANIEL
D: You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
C: SAMI
D: We have to find Sophie.
C: RAYMOND
D: How are we going to do that?
C: WAYNE
D: I know where she went.
N: They all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his joint.
C: WAYNE
D: I heard her talking on the phone. Bay View Motel. It's about five blocks from here.
S: EXT. STREET -- MORNING
N: A beat up Ford Pinto sputters down the street, black smoke spewing from the tail pipe.
S: INT. PINTO -- MOVING -- MORNING
N: Raphael is at the wheel, his eyes scanning the street for his car. In the passenger seat Hector sits calmly. They come to a red light and stop. RAPHAEL'S POV -- Across the street is low rider car. Raphael stares at it as he thinks about his own car. ON HECTOR. We see the Impala pull up beside them. Raymond is driving. Daniel, Sami and Zero are with him. Hector glances over and sees the Impala. Raymond smiles at him and nods. Hector slowly nods back. He looks over at Raphael who is still looking out the window. The light turns green. The Impala turns right. Raphael looks over at a confused Hector.
C: RAPHAEL
D: Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
C: HECTOR
D: Hard to say.
S: EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING
N: A motel like any other. Sami stands outside the office with Daniel, Raymond and Zero.
C: RAYMOND
D: How do we know what room she's in?
C: SAMI
D: Wait here.
S: INT. OFFICE -- BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING
N: Sami enters. Behind the counter is the MOTEL CLERK, middle-aged, balding.
C: SAMI
D: Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's about five six. Pretty. Dark hair.
C: MOTEL CLERK
D: I can't give out information on our guests.
C: SAMI
D: C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.
C: MOTEL CLERK
D: So are half the people in this place. I can't help you, pal.
N: Sami nods and walks outside. Through the window we see him talking with the others. A beat. Sami steps back inside with Zero.
C: MOTEL CLERK
D: Look, I can't tell you -- Before he can finish the sentence Zero has his gun out and wedged under the clerks jaw.
C: MOTEL CLERK
D: Room fourteen.
C: ZERO
D: Thank you.
S: EXT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
N: Sami knocks. The others stand off to the side of the door. Sophie opens the door and sees Sami. Before she can slam it he pushes it open.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
N: Sami pushes her onto the bed.
C: SAMI
D: I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
C: SOPHIE
D: After last night I could say the same for you.
N: Sami feigns a smile. Zero checks the bathroom to make sure she is alone. He looks at Daniel and shake his head. Raymond finds the black canvas bag on the dresser and checks the contents.
C: RAYMOND
D: The money isn't here.
C: SAMI
D: Where is it, Sophie?
C: SOPHIE
D: I don't know.
C: DANIEL
D: If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
N: She stares at them defiantly.
C: SAMI
D: Who are you waiting for?
C: SOPHIE
D: Stick around and find out.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- MORNING
N: A knock on the door. Sami clamps his hand over Sophie's mouth just in case she gets any stupid ideas. Daniel opens the door. Agent Hadley steps in, stares at Daniel, then feels the barrel of Zero's gun pressed against his head. Hadley steps into the room. Daniel closes the door. Zero searches him. Finds a gun which he gives to Daniel, then a wallet. He opens it and sees his FBI identification.
C: ZERO
D: He's FBI.
N: Zero knowingly bends down and removes Hadley's backup gun which is strapped to his ankle. He gives the gun to Sami.
C: RAYMOND
D: What is she doing with an agent du FBI?
N: Sami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas bag. Slowly it starts to come together in his mind.
C: SAMI
D: We've been set up.
N: He stares at Sophie angrily.
C: SAMI
D: We didn't go to the wrong house. We went to right one, didn't we Sophie?
N: Her expression gives away nothing.
C: SAMI
D: They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why? Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
E: beat
C: ZERO
D: What does arresting us get them?
C: SAMI
D: You wanna tell him?
E: to Hadley
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You're telling it fine.
N: Daniel motions to Zero.
C: DANIEL
D: You see my friend over there? I nod to him and he's going to put a bullet in your knee.
N: Zero stares at Hadley, just waiting for Daniel to give him the go ahead.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You wouldn't.
N: Daniel nods. Zero aims his gun at Hadley's knee cap.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: That's going to make a lot of noise. Not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger.
N: They know he's right.
C: SAMI
D: He's got a point.
N: Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. He pulls the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires together. They spark. Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches them to his hand. Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams. Sami removes the wires. Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark on his hand.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Okay! Okay! We've been investigating Zammito for years, but we've never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house. We got word through a snitch that Zammito was planning on taking Bonanno out.
C: DANIEL
D: We know all this.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You just don't take out a boss. You need permission from the other families to do something like that. Our informant told us that Zammito was talking with other bosses and recording their conversations in case they later claimed they weren't involved. Look at these tapes. The guy has recorded every conversation he's had for years.
C: DANIEL
D: So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him.
N: Agent Hadley nods.
C: SAMI
D: What are you getting out of this?
E: to Sophie
N: There is no point in hiding anything now.
C: SOPHIE
D: Money. It was supposed to simple. In and out.
E: More
N: SOPHIE (Cont'd) Zammito wasn't supposed to be there.
T: QUICK CUT TO:
S: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- LAST NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: We see Zammito walk over to Mario.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives will you explain to her I had an emergency.
C: MARIO
D: Of course, Mr. Zammito.
N: Zammito leaves. Through the window we see Joey "Two Tons" open the door to the car. Zammito and Joey get in and drive away. A beat. A Taxi pulls up. The front door opens and Sophie enters, all dressed up and beautiful. She walks up to Mario.
C: SOPHIE
D: Hi. I'm meeting Frankie Zammito --
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
N: Sami stares at her with contempt.
C: SAMI
D: Why?
C: SOPHIE
D: Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
C: DANIEL
D: For what?
C: SOPHIE
D: Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
C: DANIEL
D: What kind of business?
C: SOPHIE
D: Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
C: SAMI
D: So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
C: RAYMOND
D: No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
C: DANIEL
D: We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You walk out with that bag and you won't only have Zammito and his people after you. You'll have the entire United States justice department. How far do you think you'll get? I know who you are Mr. Foray? Mr. Zerhouni. Mr. Gayet. Mr...
E: looks at Zero
N: Agent Hadley looks to Sophie.
C: SOPHIE
D: Zero. That's all I know.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You'll never get out of the city.
N: They move to the door.
S: EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING
N: Daniel, Sami, Raymond and Zero walk to the Impala.
C: DANIEL
D: Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
C: ZERO
D: You want Zero to kill him?
C: DANIEL
D: I'm going to kill him myself!
C: ZERO
D: What about the money?
C: SAMI
D: It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
C: ZERO
D: We don't know that for sure.
C: DANIEL
D: Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
C: RAYMOND
D: She probably hid it at her place. The six of us could find it in --
C: SAMI
D: -- We don't have time to look for it. Hadley's first move is going to be to look for us there.
E: overlapping
N: Daniel dials a number on his cell phone.
C: DANIEL
D: We're moving. Pack up and be on the street in five minutes.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
N: Agent Hadley steps out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around the burn on his hand.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
C: SOPHIE
D: Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: I can't bring the Bureau into this. If I do the tapes become evidence.
C: SOPHIE
D: They're supposed to be evidence. That's why Bastaldi set this up.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
C: SOPHIE
D: I thought you wanted Zammito?
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
N: She likes the idea. Already she's thinking how she can work her way into this.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Too many people know about my involvement in this.
C: SOPHIE
D: Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
N: His jaw tightens.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You're right about that.
N: Hadley is standing behind her. He lifts up the brass lamp with his towel and swings down hard towards Sophie's head.
S: EXT. STREET, SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING
N: Marcel, Julien and Wayne are waiting as the Impala drives up. Raymond hops out of the car.
C: RAYMOND
D: I would like to thank you for your hospitality. If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
E: hands him a card
C: WAYNE
D: Cool.
N: Marcel grabs Raymond and leads him back to the car. Daniel sees Lamar standing across the street.
C: DANIEL
D: I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
E: to the others
C: LAMAR
D: What do you want now?
C: DANIEL
D: Guns. Can you get them?
C: LAMAR
D: Man, I can get anything.
C: DANIEL
D: Don't bullshit me.
C: LAMAR
D: I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
C: DANIEL
D: I've got a way with people.
C: LAMAR
D: I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
C: DANIEL
D: I'm from Belgium.
C: LAMAR
D: Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
C: DANIEL
D: Why haven't you turned us in?
C: LAMAR
D: I ain't no rat. You got money, right?
E: beat
N: Daniel nods.
C: LAMAR
D: And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
C: DANIEL
D: How much?
C: LAMAR
D: A thousand dollars?
C: DANIEL
D: Fine.
N: Daniel hands him his cell phone.
C: DANIEL
D: Take this. I'll call you in a few hours. You tell me where we meet.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY
N: Wayne is on the couch watching TV. There is a loud knock on the door. He opens the door to find Agent Hadley.
C: WAYNE
D: Yeah?
N: Hadley pushes past Wayne and enters.
C: WAYNE
D: Hey dude, what do you think you're doing?
N: Hadley flashes his badge.
C: WAYNE
D: Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Not today. Where are your friends?
C: WAYNE
D: They left about a half hour ago.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Where did they go?
C: WAYNE
D: I dunno.
N: Hadley punches Wayne in the face. Wayne falls to the floor.
C: WAYNE
D: Hey man, you can't do that!
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: What? This?
N: Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the chest.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Or this?
N: Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the ribs.
C: WAYNE
D: Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you?
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
C: WAYNE
D: I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
E: points to coffee table
N: Hadley sees the phone number Raymond gave Wayne on the coffee table. He puts it in his pocket and stares at Wayne, then just for the hell of it gives him one last kick in the ribs.
S: EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- DAY
N: A MAID stops her cart in front of room fourteen. She KNOCKS.
C: MAID
D: Maid service.
N: No answer. She uses her key and steps into the room. A beat. We hear a loud scream.
S: EXT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- EVENING
N: A large building near the freeway.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING
N: Raymond is on the phone.
C: RAYMOND
D: I know Mama, but I couldn't call you yesterday we were very busy. No, nothing's more important than you. I don't know. I think I'm going to have to stay a few more days.
E: in French listens listens
N: Daniel, Sami and Julien sit at a table. Marcel stares out the window sadly. Zero is flipping through the television channels.
C: DANIEL
D: Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
E: to Marcel
C: MARCEL
D: No.
C: DANIEL
D: You're sure?
C: MARCEL
D: I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
C: SAMI
D: "Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
E: correcting him
C: MARCEL
D: Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
N: Raymond hangs up the phone and joins the others.
C: SAMI
D: It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
C: DANIEL
D: I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
C: MARCEL
D: Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
C: DANIEL
D: Do I?
C: MARCEL
D: This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
C: SAMI
D: You guys used to work together?
E: surprised
C: MARCEL
D: Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
C: DANIEL
D: You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
E: in French
C: MARCEL
D: Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
E: in French
C: SAMI
D: All right, knock it off.
C: DANIEL
D: All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
E: in French
C: MARCEL
D: I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
E: in French
C: DANIEL
D: What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
E: in French
N: They take a step towards each other. Sami steps in between them.
C: SAMI
D: I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
C: RAYMOND
D: It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
C: JULIEN
D: Well, I say the whole deal is off. In fact, if you ask me, there never was a deal because we were screwed from the start.
N: Zero turns to another channel. A news broadcast. We see a mug shot photo of SAMI on the screen.
C: ZERO
D: Hey Sami, you're on TV.
N: Zero turns up the volume.
C: REPORTER
D: ... Sami Zerhouni in connection with the murder of Sophie Nichols.
N: Sami is stunned.
C: SAMI

C: JULIEN
D: Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?

D: That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
N: Sami gets into Julien's face.
C: SAMI

C: DANIEL
D: We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
C: RAYMOND
D: Why not just steal another one?
C: DANIEL
D: Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
C: JULIEN
D: Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.

They arrive at room 211 and knock. The door is opened by a very large BLACK MAN. Behind him we can see Lamar with ELLWOOD, 20's, sun glasses, his neck draped in gold chains.

D: He's my cousin. He's deaf.
N: Daniel removes an envelope full of cash.
C: DANIEL
D: We're here to buy, not steal. If you guys are straight there's not going to be a problem.
N: Ellwood stomps his foot several times on the floor. The black guy feels the vibration and turns around.
C: ELLWOOD
D: Let them in.
N: The black guy steps aside. Daniel and Zero enter.
S: INT. BARCLAY HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
N: Ellwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases displaying a variety of weapons.
C: ELLWOOD
D: What can I do you for?
N: Daniel looks over the merchandise.
C: DANIEL
D: How much for the nines?
C: ELLWOOD
D: A grand a piece.
C: DANIEL
D: I'll need extra clips and ammo.
N: Daniel starts counting out the money. Ellwood points a .357 magnum he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them.
C: LAMAR
D: What the hell you doing, Ellwood? I gave them my word.
C: ELLWOOD
D: Zammito's offering twenty grand a head for these guys. You think I'm going to settle for four G's when I can make forty? All right. Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor.
E: to Daniel
N: Daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks it under the bed.
C: ELLWOOD
D: I said put it on the floor, not kick it under the bed.
N: Ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each word so he can read his lips.
C: ELLWOOD
D: Get that and add it to my inventory.

C: ELLWOOD
D: Okay, put it on the floor... and do not kick it under the fuckin' bed.
C: ZERO
D: No.
E: flatly
N: He stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes.
C: ELLWOOD
D: No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy, if you're thinking about makin' a move, don't. Nobody is that fast.
C: ZERO
D: Zero is.
C: ELLWOOD
D: Who's Zero?
C: LAMAR
D: He is.
N: Ellwood is confused. Daniel bolts to his left. Ellwood's eyes leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's forehead. Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs after them. A beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what has transpired in the room.
C: BLACK GUY
D: Found it!
S: EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING
N: Daniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope.

D: There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
C: LAMAR

D: And the other car?
C: UNIFORMED COP
D: Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
C: UNIFORMED COP
D: No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?

S: INT. RESTAURANT -- EVENING
N: Because of the early hour the room is empty. Raphael and Hector are with FREDDY O, 30's, hard-looking. He is wearing a bus boy uniform as he sets the tables.

D: I can't believe someone would have the balls to rip off your ride.
C: RAPHAEL
D: When I find them they won't have them for much longer.
C: FREDDY O
D: I'll ask around. If they try to move it I can find out.

N: Raphael and Hector exit. We move with them through the door into...
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL LOBBY -- EVENING
N: Raphael and Hector head for the front door. The elevator doors opens and Sami exits. They walk past each other as Sami heads across the lobby and into the gift shop. As Raphael and Hector walk out the front door Agent Hadley steps in walks past them. He goes over to a WOMAN CLERK at the front desk.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: I'd like to see the manager please.
N: She walks over to the HOTEL MANAGER and points to Agent Hadley. The Manager walks over.
C: HOTEL MANAGER
D: May I help you?
N: Agent Hadley shows him his badge.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: I'm looking for several French men who checked in within the last twenty four hours.
C: HOTEL MANAGER
D: They checked in last night.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: I need you to take me to their room.
N: Agent Hadley follows the manager as they walks towards the elevators and pass... Sami who pretends to read a magazine, covering his face so Hadley will not see him. Sami walks quickly across the lobby and passes... Joey "Two Tons", Nicky "The Rake" and three other WISEGUYS enter the hotel. Agent Hadley gets in an elevator with the Hotel Manager. The doors close as the wiseguys approach. The moment the doors close Sami bolts into the lobby and over to the house phones. All of them are being used except one. A MAN is just about to lift the receiver when Sami pushes him aside.
C: MAN
D: Excuse me. I was here first.
N: Sami ignores him as he waits for the hotel operator to answer. The phone just rings and rings. Behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter. Sami's frustration is growing as the phone continues to ring. The Man who Sami pushed away is still there.
C: MAN
D: Hey buddy, you just can't push in here.
C: SAMI
D: Go away.
C: MAN
D: I most certainly will not go--
N: Sami quickly smacks him on the head with the receiver. The man slinks away.

C: DANIEL
D: Because you're the closest.
C: RAYMOND
D: I'm not any closer than you are.
S: INT. ELEVATOR -- EVENING
N: The wiseguys watch the floor indicator.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING
N: The phone continues RINGING.
C: DANIEL
D: Why is everything an argument with you?
C: RAYMOND
D: I'm just setting my boundaries.
N: Daniel looks at Raymond and sighs, then gets up and lifts he receiver.
C: DANIEL
D: Hello?
C: SAMI
D: Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
E: V.O.
N: Daniel slams down the phone. The others can see the urgency on his face.
C: DANIEL
D: Raymond, grab the tapes. We're leaving!
C: RAYMOND
D: Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
C: DANIEL
D: Jesus!
N: Daniel grabs the canvas bag.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING
N: The manager is about to open the door with his key. Agent Hadley takes it and removes a gun.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You should go now.
N: The manager runs away. Agent Hadley inserts the key and opens the door. His face fills with fear as he sees... AGENT HADLEY'S POV -- Daniel, Marcel, Raymond and Zero are on the other side, their guns pointed at Hadley's head.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM -- EVENING
N: Daniel uses Hadley's handcuffs and handcuffs him to a pipe under the sink.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING
N: Daniel, Raymond, Marcel and Zero step into the hall. The moment they do the elevator doors at the end of the hall open. The Wiseguys step out and see them. The door to the room next to theirs opens and a LITTLE GIRL, 8, dressed in a pink dress steps out.
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: C'mon, Mommy.
E: calling into her room
N: Everything seems to move in slow motion. -- The Wiseguys go for their guns. -- The crew goes for theirs. -- The little girl is caught between both groups. -- Marcel lunges forward, tackling the girl to ground. -- The Wiseguys begin to shoot. -- The hallway fills with gunfire. -- Marcel pulls the little girl into her room. -- Plaster explodes off the walls as bullets rip through them. -- The Crew rushes back into their suite.
S: INT. LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM -- EVENING
N: Marcel hands the frightened girl to her mother, then moves over to the door that joins with the crews. He shoots the lock and moves through the door.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING
N: As Marcel steps through he sees the crew all aiming their guns at him. Daniel gets an idea. As Zero holds off the Wiseguys from the doorway, Daniel goes to the adjoining door on the other side of the suite. He shoots off the lock.
C: DANIEL
D: Let's go! The Crew moves through the door.
S: INT. ADJOINING MOTEL ROOM -- EVENING
N: Empty. The crew runs across to the door. Because the room is built at the intersection of two hallways the crew step out into a corridor out of the Wiseguys line of sight.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- BACK HALLWAY -- EVENING
N: The Crew exits and heads for the staircase.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- FRONT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS
N: Silence. The Wiseguys move down the hall and stop outside the door of the Crew's suite. A beat. They rush in.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Empty. Nicky "The Rake" sees the open adjoining door and motions for them to follow him.
S: INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- BACK HALLWAY -- EVENING
N: The Wiseguys step out just as the Crew are going through the door to the stairwell. The Wiseguys run after them. Joey "Two Tons" lags behind.
S: INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING
N: The Crew runs down the stairs. Above them the Wiseguys follow. Joey "Two Tons" is breathing heavily as he runs down the stairs.
S: INT. UNDER GROUND PARKING LOT -- EVENING
N: The door flies open as the Crew runs across the lot. Sami has already started the Impala and is waiting for them. A moment later the stairwell door opens and the Wiseguys run out, guns blazing. The Crew heads for the Impala, shooting behind them as they run. Nicky "The Rake"" shoots. Zero is hit in the leg. He falls to the ground, then rolls on his side behind a parked car. He fights through the pain, props himself up and begins to shoot back. Two Wiseguys step out to flank Zero. Zero takes aim and shoots one. He lines up on the other Wiseguy and pulls the trigger again. Click! His gun his empty. Daniel and Marcel run towards Zero, firing their guns as fast as they can pull the trigger. Marcel takes aim and fires. The Wiseguy's dive for cover as Marcel blazes away until his gun is empty. We hear tires screeching as the Impala backs up. The Wiseguys shoot, blowing out the back window. They move in on Marcel and Zero. Daniel runs forward with two guns firing at the wiseguys. As he nears Marcel he throws the extra gun to him. SLOW MOTION :on the gun as it flies through the air. SLOW MOTION: One of the WISEGUYS has almost circle around the car. SLOW MOTION: on the gun has it flies through the air. REAL TIME -- ON MARCEL: He looks to his left just as the gun arrives. It hits him on the forehead and knocks him down. Daniel fires a few SHOTS driving the Wiseguy back. He runs over and with Marcel's help they grab Zero and help him to the car. They dive into the back seat. The car screeches forward and races out of the garage. Silence. The staircase door opens and an exhausted Joey "Two Tons" steps out, gasping for air.
S: INT. IMPALA -- MOVING -- EVENING
N: Daniel attends to the wound on Zero's leg.
C: DANIEL
D: The bullet went clean through.
N: Daniel stares at him. A beat. Zero grins, saying thank you.
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP -- EVENING
N: A distraught Raphael sits across from Hector in a booth near the window. Hector has almost finished eating. Raphael hasn't touched his food. He pushes his plate away.
C: RAPHAEL
D: I can't eat.
N: Raphael lowers his head sadly. Hector looks out the window. HIS POV -- of the Impala driving by -- rear window missing, bumper about to fall off. Hector watches it go by, then turns back. Raphael looks up.
C: HECTOR
D: So, can I have your fries?
S: EXT. COZY COURT COTTAGES -- EVENING
N: A group of small bungalows built adjacent to the interstate.
S: INT. COTTAGE -- EVENING
N: Small. Filled with cheap furniture. A small kitchenette is off to the side of the room. Zero lays on the bed. Daniel uses his belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. Raymond sits at the table staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes. Marcel is in the kitchenette.
C: DANIEL
D: When we get back to Paris I'll take you dancing.
E: to Zero
N: Zero smiles. Sami enters carrying a shopping bag. He places it on the counter.
C: DANIEL
D: Bring me the scissors.
C: ZERO
D: And the Vodka.
N: Sami removes the items from the bag. He opens the bottle and hands it to Zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls.
C: DANIEL
D: Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
C: ZERO
D: And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
N: He winks at Sami.
C: SAMI
D: What's he joking around for? He's been shot.
C: DANIEL
D: He's been shot a lot. He's used to it.
N: Raymond cuts the pant leg away. Daniel walks over to Marcel who is standing over the gas range. Over the flame is a tire wrench, the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes some white bread.
C: SAMI
D: Anybody hungry?
C: DANIEL
D: What'd you get?
C: SAMI
D: Some bread and...
N: He removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the bread.
C: SAMI
D: Cheese.
N: All the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet.
C: DANIEL
D: Cheese? In a can?
N: Sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite.
C: SAMI
D: It's good.
C: MARCEL
D: God, I want to go home.
C: SAMI
D: Hey, you know you can't this in France.
C: DANIEL
D: Thank God.
N: Daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to the bed. Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about to happen.
C: DANIEL
D: Ready?
E: to Zero
N: Zero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His face contorts violently from the pain.
S: INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- EVENING
N: Zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta. DEAN MARTIN "Innamaraia" plays on the stereo. EDDIE, 60's, arthritic, finishes making an espresso. He starts carrying it over to Zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in front of the other. Zammito watches him with strained patience. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" enter. Their faces tell the story.
C: ZAMMITO
D: What happened?
C: NICKY "THE RAKE"
D: They sort of got away.
C: ZAMMITO
D: I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
C: JOEY "TWO TONS"
D: But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Oh, I'm sorry.
N: Zammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws it at him.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Had enough?
N: Joey "Two Tons" looks down sheepishly, several pieces of pasta are stuck to his face. Zammito walks over to him.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Try to get this through that fat, stupid fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth Tony finds these guys before we do and Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead.
N: They turn around and leave. Zammito stares after them angrily.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Cafones!
N: He looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table.
C: ZAMMITO
D: You gonna bring that over here today, or what?
S: INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

D: I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
N: RAYMOND J&B?
C: SAMI
D: Glenmorangie.
C: RAYMOND
D: Glenmorangie is very good.
N: Sami realizes that Raymond wants to talk about something... anything... that will get his mind of the events that have lead them here.
C: SAMI
D: But I'll have a glass of Beaujolais with you when we get back.
N: Raymond forces a weak smile. Daniel who has been watching them grabs a few things off the table.
C: DANIEL
D: I'll be back in an hour.
N: Daniel looks at Sami and motions for him to come outside.
S: EXT. COTTAGE -- MORNING
N: Sami steps outside. Daniel is staring at him.
C: SAMI
D: What?
C: DANIEL
D: Can I trust you, Sami?
C: SAMI
D: Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
C: DANIEL
D: If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
C: SAMI
D: No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
C: DANIEL
D: You haven't answered my question.
C: SAMI
D: Does it really matter what I say?
C: DANIEL

C: BONANNO
D: Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
C: DANIEL
D: I guess we're going to find out.
C: BONANNO
D: You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
C: DANIEL
D: Not such a good friend. May I reach in my pocket?
E: overlapping
N: Bonanno looks to Half Tooth Tony.
C: HALF TOOTH TONY
D: He's clean.
N: Bonanno nods. Daniel removes the cassette player and turns it on.
C: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
D: Of course. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here Frankie. We're talking about a boss.
C: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
D: Bonanno's a dinosaur.
E: More
N: ZAMMITO'S VOICE (Cont'd) Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The old ways are gone. If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out. I need to know if I can count on your support? Daniel turns off the tape. Bonanno's anger is visible.
C: DANIEL
D: I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
C: BONANNO
D: I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
E: seething
C: DANIEL
D: He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
C: BONANNO
D: I assume you want something?

D: We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
C: BONANNO

C: BONANNO
D: And for my help I would get what?
C: DANIEL
D: Half the tapes.
C: BONANNO
D: And the other half?
C: DANIEL
D: I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
C: BONANNO
D: I only have your word for that.
C: DANIEL
D: I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
C: BONANNO
D: Where are you staying?
N: Daniel grins. He isn't going to tell him.
C: BONANNO
D: I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
C: DANIEL
D: How about if I call you?
S: INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING
N: Zero and Raymond are sleeping. We hear the shower running in the bathroom. Sami is at the table. The black canvas bag containing the tapes is on the table. Sami removes the identical canvas bag he bought at the store from under the bed and places it on the table. He takes the original and leaves.
S: EXT. COZY COURTS -- MORNING
N: Sami removes the card Hadley gave him, takes out his cell phone and dials. A taxi pulls up.
C: SAMI
D: Same place. One hour.
N: Sami gets in the taxi and it drives away. A beat. A moment later another taxi pulls up. Daniel gets out.
S: INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING
N: Daniel enters to find Zero and Raymond still sleeping. He looks at the black canvas bag on the table. Marcel steps out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel.
S: EXT. GRANT PARK -- MORNING
N: Hadley is waiting by the statue holding a cardboard box. Sami walks towards him holding the black canvas bag.
C: SAMI
D: What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
N: Sami holds up the canvas bag.
C: SAMI
D: The lamp?
N: Hadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base. Sami hands him the canvas bag.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Just a second. You must think I'm a real moron.
N: Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket. He picks a tape and inserts it into the player.
C: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
D: I just came by to tell that "piece of work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks -- It's done.
C: BONANNO'S VOICE
D: Good. How'd he go?
C: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
D: Like the crying rat bastard that he was.
N: Hadley stops the tape. He inserts another one.
C: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
D: Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this guy. He's a congressman.
C: BONANNO'S VOICE
D: I made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We pay him each month to look after our interests.
N: Hadley grins. This is great stuff. He looks up at Sami.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Here you go, sport.
N: Sami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops out with two of his friends. All of them have guns.
C: LAMAR
D: I'll take the bag.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You don't think I see through this? You tell Sami he's dead.
N: One of Lamar's guys searches through Hadley's pockets, finds his gun, then takes his wallet.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: You're making a big mistake. I'm an FBI agent.
N: Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops the canvas bag. Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there fuming. Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it. ANGLE -- BEHIND THE STATUE Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag. As Lamar passes they quickly exchange bags. From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it. Lamar's buddies are already at the street.
C: LAMAR'S BUDDIES
D: C'mon, man! Let's get out of here.
N: Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked. He runs off leaving the bag laying on the grass. ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves. ON DANIEL: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as Hadley walks off in the other direction.
S: EXT. STREET CORNER -- MORNING
N: Daniel arrives to find Sami and Lamar.
C: SAMI
D: See, I told you that you could trust me.
N: Daniel grins and pats him on the back.
C: LAMAR
D: Okay, we're square now, right?
C: DANIEL
D: There's just one more thing I need you to do.
N: Lamar is about to protest when Daniel takes out a roll of bills.
C: LAMAR
D: I'm listening.
S: INT. TAXI -- MOVING -- DAY

S: INT. HADLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: Hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette. Hadley pops the cassette into the VCR. On the screen we see Sami speaking into a video camera.
C: SAMI
D: Since we're such good pals I thought I'd sneak you an advanced copy of my latest work. I call it, "I am a scum-sucking FBI agent".
N: On the television screen we see Hadley and Sami in the park on their first meeting.
C: SAMI
D: You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
C: SAMI
D: You didn't have to kill Sophie.
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
N: The color drains from Hadley's face. Sami reappears, talking into the camera again.
C: SAMI
D: It's a little arty I know, but it has great content, don't you think? You were so busy looking for a wire you probably didn't even think about a video camera. It was on the statue. Anyway, I've sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take the day off.
N: The tape turns to static. Hadley tries to think. He takes the VHS tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to dial a number. A beat. He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses his cell phone.
S: INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- DAY
N: Eddie is on the phone. Zammito is at his usual table.
C: EDDIE

C: ZAMMITO
D: Watch the paint.

N: Zammito nods to Joey "Two Tons" who opens another briefcase filled with cash.
C: ZAMMITO
D: How'd you get these?
C: AGENT HADLEY
D: I got 'em. That's all you need to know.
N: Hadley starts to go. Zammito motions him to stop.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Just a second.
N: Zammito picks a tape and tosses it to Joey "Two Tons." Who puts the cassette into the cars cassette player. Suddenly we hear Wayne Newton singing "Danke Schoen."
C: WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
D: Danke Schoen, darling Danke Schoen. Thank you for all the joy and pain...
N: Hadley's face turns white. He produces an audible gulp as he looks at Zammito weakly.
S: EXT. MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building.
C: WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
D: Pictures show, second balcony, was the place we'd meet...

S: EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

C: ZAMMITO
D: What's this?
C: VINNY
D: A car.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
C: VINNY
D: It's for you.
C: ZAMMITO
D: For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
C: VINNY
D: I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
C: ZAMMITO
D: Okay. Okay.
C: VINNY
D: I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
N: Vinny starts to walk away.
C: ZAMMITO

E: yelling after him
S: EXT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT -- AFTERNOON
N: A gang hang out. Raphael is with several hard-looking gang-bangers. Lamar arrives with two of his friends.
C: RAPHAEL
D: You lost?
C: LAMAR
D: Don't come off like a hard-on with me. I'm about to make you a very happy man.
S: EXT. GANG HANGOUT -- AFTERNOON
N: Several Gang Bangers stand around their low rider cars. Sananta's "Oye Como Va" plays loudly on one of the radios. Raphael talks heatedly with several of the gang bangers.
T: A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
N: Music continues as several gang members check their guns.
S: EXT. STREET -- AFTERNOON
N: The Santana song continues as several car loads of Gang Bangers drive down the street.
S: INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON
N: The air is thick with cigar smoke. Several GUMBAS hang around the bar. Zammito is at his table with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake." DEAN MARTIN "Return To me" plays on the jukebox. Outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a stop. The door opens and Raphael and ten other very tough-looking GANG MEMBERS step inside. The room falls silent, except for Dino on the jukebox. Zammito stands up.
C: RAPHAEL
D: Anybody know about that car outside?
C: ZAMMITO
D: Yeah. It's mine.
C: RAPHAEL
D: No. It's mine.
C: ZAMMITO
D: The hell it is.
C: RAPHAEL
D: I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!
C: ZAMMITO
D: And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
C: RAPHAEL
D: Fuck you, grease-ball!
C: ZAMMITO
D: Fuck me? Fuck you!
N: They are right on the edge of having a major disaster. The Dean Martin song ends. Dead quiet. Each group watches the other to see who's going to make the first move. The jukebox selects another record. The needle scratches against the vinyl intro. We hear the intro to JERRY VALE singing "Amore Scusami".
T: SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
N: -- Raphael's eyes burn into Zammito's -- A Gang-Bangers eyes dart from side to side. -- A Wiseguy bites his lip. -- Nicky "The Rake" twitches his fingers nervously. -- Sweat glistens on the forehead of Joey "Two Tons". At the bar Eddie reaches behind for something without looking. He knocks over a bottle. It falls to the floor and breaks. The noise is enough to push things over the edge.
C: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
D: My love, forgive me...
N: Raphael goes for his gun. All hell breaks loose! People dive for cover as shots rings out. In the close quarters it's like shooting fish in a barrel.
C: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
D: I didn't mean to have it end like this...
N: Eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang member. Another gang member kills him. It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. Finally it is quiet.
C: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
D: I didn't mean to have you fall in love, in love with me...
N: We move through the room, past the carnage. Smoke swirls, blood covers the floor. Raphael is dead. Along with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar. He sits up, amazed that he is untouched. He gets to his feet and makes his way to the front door.
S: EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON
N: Music continues. Zammito staggers outside and into the street. He laughs, a nervous laugh at his good fortune.
C: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
D: My love, please kiss me...
N: Zammito turns around to see ZAMMITO'S POV -- A Lincoln Town car speeding towards him. Through the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony. The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air. He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead. The Lincoln speeds off down the street.
C: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
D: Arrivederci amore kiss me...
S: INT. BONANNO'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

C: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
D: You'll have my heart...
S: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
N: Music continues. Wayne is sitting on the couch, an open package on the coffee table. He smiles as he stares at the stacks of cash the crew took from Zammito.
S: INT. PLANE -- MOVING -- AFTERNOON
N: Music continues. The crew sits quietly.
C: JERRY VALE'S VOICE

S: EXT. PLANE -- MOVING -- AFTERNOON
N: Jerry Vale continues singing as the plane glides through a clear
T: blue sky. Music fades. DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BASTALDI'S'S WAREHOUSE -- PARIS -- MORNING
N: Bastaldi steps outside into the crisp morning air. He takes a few steps, then stops. BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch, tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they stare at Bastaldi. A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys. When it passes the crew it gone! Bastaldi bites his lip nervously. Bastaldi looks around, but there is no sign of them.
C: A DIFFERENT ANGLE
D: We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure out where they went. They are all amused with Bastaldi's bewilderment.
C: RAYMOND
D: What's he doing?
C: MARCEL
D: He's looking around for us.
C: ZERO
D: Zero can't stay like this much longer. His leg is hurting.
N: Finally, Bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment.
S: INT. BASTALDI'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY
N: Bastaldi is at his desk, nervously tapping his fingers on the surface. The phone rings. He knows who is calling. He stares at the phone for a long moment, then he slowly lifts the receiver.
C: BASTALDI
D: Hello?
C: DANIEL
D: It's Daniel.
E: V.O. in French
C: BASTALDI
D: Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
E: in French
C: DANIEL
D: -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
E: V.O. overlapping; in French
C: BASTALDI
D: A million! I don't have that kind of money.
E: in French
C: DANIEL
D: Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh.
E: V.O. in French
C: BASTALDI
D: I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
E: In French
C: DANIEL
D: Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
E: V.O. in French
N: The line goes dead.
S: EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
N: Bastaldi drives up. He gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously walks to the boat.
S: INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
N: Bastaldi enters. No one appears to be there. Bastaldi's cell phone rings. He answers it.
C: DANIEL
D: Go back on deck. There's a small rowboat in the water --
E: V.O. in French
S: EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS
N: Daniel, Sami and Zero watch the houseboat. Daniel continues his conversation on the cell phone.
C: DANIEL
D: Put the money in the rowboat and untie it. The current will carry it down river. When we see that the money is there I'll call back and tell you where the tapes are.
E: in French
N: DANIEL'S POV: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the suitcase in the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the current.
S: EXT. DOWN RIVER -- AFTERNOON
N: The rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river. Marcel is on the shore with Raymond. Raymond reaches out with a long pole and pulls the boat to shore. Marcel opens the case. Inside are several stacks of five hundred franc notes. Marcel looks to Raymond with a grin and nods. Raymond opens his cell phone.
S: EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS
N: Daniel, Sami and Zero continue to watch the houseboat. Sami's cell phone rings. He answers it and listens.
C: RAYMOND
D: We're in business.
E: V.O.
N: Sami nods to Daniel.
S: EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
N: Bastaldi's cell phone rings. He answers it.
C: DANIEL
D: Go down into the main cabin. The tapes are in the wooden chest.
E: V.O. in French
N: The line goes dead.
S: INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
N: Bastaldi enters, looks around the room until he sees the wooden chest. He walks over and opens it. Inside there are several cassette tapes in the cardboard box. Bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest. He hears a CLICK. He notices something is attached to the bottom of the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin on an electronic device.
S: EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- CONTINUOUS
N: Daniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts flashing. He puts his finger on a red button.
C: DANIEL
D: This is for Julien.
N: He presses the button.
S: INT. HOUSEBOAT -- CONTINUOUS
N: A digital counter begins counting backwards. Bastaldi realizes that the device is a BOMB. He stares at the numbers quickly speed by 8... 7... 6... 5...
C: BASTALDI
D: Oh, Merde!
S: EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- FIVE SECONDS LATER
N: The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of wood and metal flying into the air. A thick plume of black smoke swirls in the wind.
S: EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- AFTERNOON
N: Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering wreckage. Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that justice has been done.
C: SAMI
D: Did you have to use that much explosive?
C: DANIEL
D: I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
N: Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.
C: DANIEL
D: You didn't check it?
S: EXT. BRIDGE -- AFTERNOON
N: The five of them walk across the bridge.
C: MARCEL
D: I'm sorry! I was caught up in the excitement of the moment. I should have checked. I made a mistake. I suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake before?
N: No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.
C: SAMI
D: This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
C: MARCEL
D: The baseball is mine.
C: SAMI
D: No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
N: Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag.
C: MARCEL
D: I'm the one who took it. It's my baseball!
C: ZERO
D: If you say baseball one more time Zero will shoot you.
C: MARCEL
D: Raymond, don't you think they're over reacting a little?
C: RAYMOND
D: No. I think they have a right to express their anger with you in light of the fact that you're...
E: something in him snaps
N: A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD! Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise. Even Raymond is surprised by his outburst.
C: MARCEL
D: Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
C: SAMI
D: No.
C: MARCEL
D: Give it to me, Sami.
C: SAMI
D: No!
N: Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away. Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls off the bridge into the river.
C: SAMI
D: Perfect.
N: Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag. Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration. Something catches Daniel's attention. DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers". Daniel's jaw drops. The others notice his stunned expression and follow his stare. THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting. They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward. They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them. The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there, watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.
S: EXT. BRIDGE -- WIDE SHOT -- AFTERNOON
N: They look at one an other, then without speaking a word they all jump off the bridge. As they fall towards the water we... FREEZE FRAME
