T: FADE IN:
N: FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the policemen directing traffic. PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS waiting at street corner for light to change. CLOSE SHOT - MAN at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the sky.
S: TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM
N: as she follows his gaze upward. LONG SHOT - THE SKY with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling. MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES: MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop. She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters.
S: INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT
N: Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS. MacGRUDER, comes toward her.
C: MELANIE
D: Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Hello, Miss Daniels.
C: MELANIE
D: What do you suppose it is?
N: MED. SHOT Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is BARKING, o.s.
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know.
E: shaking her head
N: They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end. There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. As they walk:
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
E: apologetically
C: MELANIE
D: You said three o'clock.
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: I know. Oh, I know. I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
E: she is more distressed now
C: MELANIE
D: Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
C: MELANIE
D: And he'll talk?
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Yes. Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
E: pause pause
C: MELANIE
D: I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
E: judiciously she begins taking off her gloves
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Oh. Oh, well, all right.
E: producing pencil and pad
N: As Melanie starts writing:
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
C: MELANIE
D: Well, all right, but...
E: with a resigned sigh
N: She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's. It's past three, you know. Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait.
E: O.S. pause; accusingly pause
N: Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up. MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt hat. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh. The birds are startled into scarlet flight. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner. MED. SHOT - MELANIE looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.
C: MITCH
D: I wonder if you could help me.
C: MELANIE
D: What?
C: MITCH
D: I said I wonder if you could help me.
E: deliberately, and with a touch of hauteur
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
E: solicitously
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
C: MITCH
D: Lovebirds.
E: deadpan
C: MELANIE
D: Lovebirds, sir?
C: MITCH
D: Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
C: MELANIE
D: Well... yes, sir, there are.
C: MITCH
D: These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
C: MELANIE
D: I understand completely, sir.
C: MITCH
D: As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
C: MELANIE
D: No, of course not.
E: leading him around shop
C: MITCH
D: Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
C: MELANIE
D: I think so, sir. Now then, let me see.
E: she looks around
C: MITCH
D: Aren't these lovebirds?
E: at the finches
C: MELANIE
D: No, sir, those are... redbirds.
C: MITCH
D: The sign says strawberry finches.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, we call them that too. Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
E: airily she moves away and stops before a cage of canaries
C: MITCH
D: Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
E: pause
C: MELANIE
D: Doesn't what make me...?
E: baffled
C: MITCH
D: All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
C: MELANIE
D: Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
C: MITCH
D: I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
C: MELANIE
D: Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
C: MITCH
D: I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
C: MITCH
D: Are they moulting now?
C: MELANIE
D: Some of them are.
C: MITCH
D: How can you tell?
C: MELANIE
D: Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
N: CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V. The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.
C: MITCH
D: Yes, I see. About those lovebirds, Miss...
E: pause
C: MELANIE
D: Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
C: MITCH
D: All right. She smiles back.
E: he smiles
C: MITCH
D: All right, may I see one, please?
E: he waits
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.
C: MELANIE
D: Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.
E: feebly
N: One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.
C: MELANIE
D: Oh! Ohhhhh!
N: FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all day.
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the birds is loose!
N: She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously.
C: MITCH
D: Shhh! Shhhh!
N: He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH the canary in his hand.
C: MELANIE
D: There we are!
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
N: FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the door.
C: MITCH
D: Back into your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels.
E: putting the canary in
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE startled.
C: MELANIE
D: What did you say?
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
C: MITCH
D: I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
E: savoring this
C: MELANIE
D: But how... how do you know my name?
C: MITCH
D: A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
E: secretly he smiles politely he bows to Mrs. MacGruder he starts out
C: MELANIE
D: Hey, wait a minute!
N: She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:
C: MELANIE
D: I don't know you.
C: MITCH
D: Ahhh, but I know you.
C: MELANIE
D: How?
C: MITCH
D: We met in court.
C: MELANIE
D: We never met in court or anyplace else.
C: MITCH
D: That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
C: MELANIE
D: When?
C: MITCH
D: Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
C: MELANIE
D: I didn't break that window!
C: MITCH
D: No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
C: MELANIE
D: What are you? A policeman?
C: MITCH
D: I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
C: MELANIE
D: What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
C: MITCH
D: Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
C: MELANIE
D: You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
C: MITCH
D: Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
C: MELANIE
D: I think you're a louse.
C: MITCH
D: I am. Good day. Madam.
E: he tips his hat to Mrs. MacGruder and he goes down the steps
C: MELANIE
D: And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
C: MITCH
D: I'll find something else. See you in court some day.
E: breezily, as he goes out he gives a slight bow
N: The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.
C: MELANIE
D: That... that... who was that?
E: angrily
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: I have no idea.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea. MED. SHOT - MELANIE going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She looks through the glass. LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V. getting into his car at the curb. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE looking after the car at the curb. CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns. FULL SHOT - MELANIE as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter. MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V. as she comes up to the counter.
C: MELANIE
D: Have you got a pencil?
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: What? Oh, yes, certainly.
N: As Melanie begins writing:
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
C: MELANIE
D: No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Yes, certainly.
E: bewildered by everything she puts phone on counter
C: MELANIE
D: Do you have any lovebirds?
E: as she dials
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
C: MELANIE
D: How soon?
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: Well... well, how soon would you want them?
C: MELANIE
D: Immediately. Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
E: into phone
C: MRS. MACGRUDER
D: I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
C: MELANIE
D: That would be just fine. Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me. No, this is a small one. Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you? Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six. Yes, a California plate. No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office? Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
E: with an edged anger into phone pause pause pause pause pause she hangs up
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.
C: MELANIE
D: Now. What time tomorrow morning?
T: FADE IN:
N: FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around to the other side, and opens the door. CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS in a cage as Melanie reaches for them. MED. SHOT - MELANIE turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons. CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND running down the list of names slowly. It stops. INSERT - THE CARD her finger beside it. BRENNER, M. 3B CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then does the same for the next column. MED. SHOT - MELANIE as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door. REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows her to enter first. She does so with a small nod. The elevator doors close. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him. Self- consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The doors begin to open. FULL SHOT - MELANIE stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. He looks at Melanie. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE smiling at him feebly. FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND reaching into the purse for a white envelope. INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER. MED. SHOT - MELANIE as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Miss...? She stops, distressed.
N: FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other end, near the elevator.

C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
E: curtly
C: MAN
D: He's not home.
C: MELANIE
D: That's all right.
N: She presses button for the elevator.
C: MAN
D: He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
C: MELANIE
D: Monday?
C: MAN
D: Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
C: MELANIE
D: Well, I...
E: trapped
N: The elevator doors open.
C: MELANIE
D: Well, where did he go?
C: MAN
D: Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.

D: Bodega Bay? Where's that?
C: MAN
D: Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
C: MELANIE
D: Sixty... Oh.
E: her face falls
C: MAN
D: About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
C: MELANIE
D: Oh.
C: MAN

C: MELANIE
D: Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
E: in utter despair now
C: MAN
D: I'm awfully sorry.
E: apologetically
N: He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to look at the birds. LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING. MED. SHOT - MELANIE surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds are COOING and CHIRPING madly.
C: MELANIE
D: Oh, shut up!
N: And she steps into the elevator.
T: DISSOLVE
N: FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE) on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE She turns wheel forcefully. CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS in the cage as the car rounds the bend.

The car turns into road by gas station. FULL SHOT - THE TOWN through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags. This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is -- is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.) FULL SHOT - THE CAR pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks quickly toward the front door. MED. SHOT - MELANIE enters post office. CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not look up as she approaches. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE through the bars of the cage.

C: MELANIE
D: Do you know him?
C: CLERK
D: Yep.
C: MELANIE
D: Where does he live?
C: CLERK
D: Right here. Bodega Bay.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, but where?
C: CLERK
D: Right across the bay there.
C: MELANIE
D: Where?
N: It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he leaves the window. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE through the bars, exasperated. REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends his arm and points.
C: CLERK
D: See where I'm pointing?
C: MELANIE
D: Yes?
N: FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)

D: Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
C: MELANIE
D: I see. How do I get down there?
C: CLERK
D: Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
C: MELANIE
D: The front door. Isn't there a back road I can take?
E: pause
C: CLERK
D: Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
C: MELANIE
D: You see, I wanted to surprise them.
C: CLERK
D: Mmmm.
C: MELANIE
D: I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
C: CLERK
D: Mmmm.
C: MELANIE
D: It's a surprise, you see.
C: CLERK
D: Mmmmmm. 'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
E: long pause
C: MELANIE
D: Where would I get a boat?
C: CLERK
D: Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
C: MELANIE
D: Of course.

C: MELANIE
D: Are you sure?
C: CLERK
D: Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
C: MELANIE
D: I need her exact name, you see.
C: CLERK
D: That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
C: MELANIE
D: Yes?
C: CLERK
D: Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
C: MELANIE
D: Thank you.

T: DISSOLVE
N: LONG SHOT (MATTE) - MELANIE'S CAR turning in school road. FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house. CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal: FULL SHOT - MELANIE passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door. The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the front door. There are white curtains in every window of the house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE waiting. She RINGS the bell again:
C: ANNIE'S VOICE
D: Yes? Who is it?
E: shouting
C: MELANIE
D: Me!
C: ANNIE'S VOICE
D: Who's me?
N: FULL SHOT - MELANIE walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty- two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face. Her hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth- stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.
C: MELANIE

C: MELANIE
D: It's a lovely garden.
C: ANNIE

D: Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss Hayworth.
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE as Annie leans over the seat.
C: ANNIE

The rear wall of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the bay and the parking area below. A television set over the bar is going.

D: Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.

D: It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
C: MITCH
D: You like me, huh?
E: grinning
C: MELANIE
D: I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.

D: What did it say?
C: MELANIE
D: None of your business. Am I still bleeding?
E: pause
N: She lowers her head.
C: MITCH
D: Can't see a thing.

Now you know chickens as well as I do, and when they won't eat, there's just something wrong with what they're being fed, that's all. No, they're not fussy chickens. Who? What's he got to do with it? Fred, I don't care how much feed you sold him. My chickens... He did? Dan Fawcett? This afternoon? Well, that only proves what I'm saying. The feed you sold us is... Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh- huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see him. You don't think there's something going around, do you? No, never. No, Fred, they don't seem sick at all. They just won't eat. Mmmm. Mmmmm.

D: In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
E: coming from kitchen
C: CATHY
D: Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods. He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it? I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
E: to Melanie she starts for living room
C: MELANIE
D: Why did he shoot her?
E: to Mitch as he carries load of dishes out
C: MITCH
D: He was watching a ball game on television.
C: MELANIE
D: What?
C: MITCH
D: His wife changed the channel.
N: He GOES INTO kitchen. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her cigarette.
C: CATHY
D: Is smoking fun?
C: MELANIE
D: Oh, I suppose so.
C: CATHY
D: Could I have a puff?
C: MELANIE
D: I don't think your mother would like that.
C: CATHY
D: Just a little one.
E: O.S.
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen. Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes a small puff.
C: CATHY
D: Why, it's just like air, isn't it? When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
E: delighted determined
C: MELANIE
D: I know.
C: CATHY
D: Are you coming to my party?
C: MELANIE
D: I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
E: seeing the child's face
C: CATHY
D: Don't you like us?
C: MELANIE
D: Darling, of course I do!
E: touching her hair
C: CATHY
D: Don't you like Bodega Bay?
C: MELANIE
D: I don't know yet.
C: CATHY
D: Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
C: MELANIE
D: I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
E: smiling
C: CATHY
D: If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
N: Melanie laughs.
C: CATHY
D: You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out where I'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother is going to say she has a headache and would I mind very much if she took me home. Then, when we get back here, all of the kids'll jump out! Won't you come? Won't you please come?
E: pause
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't think so, Cathy.
S: INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
N: Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.
C: LYDIA
D: She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
C: MITCH
D: Yes, very.
C: LYDIA
D: And certainly pretty.
C: MITCH
D: Yes.
C: LYDIA
D: How long have you known her?
C: MITCH
D: I told you. We met yesterday.
C: LYDIA
D: In a bird shop.
C: MITCH
D: Yes.
C: LYDIA
D: She was selling birds.
C: MITCH
D: No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
C: LYDIA
D: But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
C: MITCH
D: Mother, where did you go to law school?
C: LYDIA
D: Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. She's very rich, isn't she?
E: laughing pause
C: MITCH
D: I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
C: LYDIA
D: You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
C: MITCH
D: I know, Mother.
C: LYDIA
D: She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
C: MITCH
D: Yes, Mother.
C: LYDIA
D: Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
E: pause
C: MITCH
D: I know, Mother.
C: LYDIA
D: It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
C: MITCH
D: Mother?
C: LYDIA
D: Yes?
E: looking up
C: MITCH
D: I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
C: LYDIA
D: Well... So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
E: she sighs
C: MITCH
D: I know exactly what I want, Mother.
T: DISSOLVE
S: FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER LAWN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT
N: as Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car. A wind is blowing off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the face of the moon.
C: MITCH
D: You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
C: MELANIE
D: Oh, yes.
C: MELANIE
D: Will I be seeing you again?
C: MELANIE
D: San Francisco's a long way from here.
C: MITCH
D: I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
E: he grins
C: MELANIE
D: How does Mother know what I like to do?
C: MITCH
D: I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
C: MELANIE
D: Oh. That. Rome.
C: MITCH
D: Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
C: MELANIE
D: In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
C: MELANIE
D: Without any clothes on?
C: MELANIE
D: With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...
C: MITCH
D: You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
C: MELANIE
D: I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
C: MITCH
D: The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, but...
C: MITCH
D: ...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
C: MITCH
D: ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
C: MITCH
D: Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
C: MELANIE
D: No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.
E: pause
C: MITCH
D: So you didn't go to school together.
C: MELANIE
D: No.
C: MITCH
D: And you didn't come up here to see her.
C: MELANIE
D: No.
C: MITCH
D: You were lying.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, I was lying.
C: MITCH
D: Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
C: MELANIE
D: I wrote the letter.
C: MITCH
D: What did it say?
C: MELANIE
D: It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
C: MITCH
D: But you tore it up.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
C: MITCH
D: Why?
C: MELANIE
D: Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
C: MITCH
D: Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
C: MELANIE
D: I told you what happened in Rome!
C: MITCH
D: Do you expect me to believe...?
C: MELANIE
D: I don't give a damn what you believe!
N: Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door when Mitch catches it in his hands.
C: MITCH
D: I'd still like to see you.
C: MELANIE
D: Why?
C: MITCH
D: I think it could be fun.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE pulling the door shut.
C: MELANIE
D: That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
C: MITCH
D: It is for me.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
C: MELANIE
D: But not for me.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
C: MITCH
D: What do you want ?
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
C: MELANIE
D: I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
E: angrily sarcastic
N: MED. SHOT - THE CAR as it pulls away. Mitch yanks his hands back from the door. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH as he watches the car leave. LONG SHOT - THE ROAD The car turns the bend and disappears. Empty road. Only the long line of telephone poles and wires and... something strange on the wires. CLOSE SHOT MITCH His attention caught by the poles and wires. CLOSE SHOT - THE WIRES Hundreds of birds sitting on them. MED. SHOT - MITCH standing and watching. A wind blows off the water. He shivers suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house.
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE
N: HAYWORTH In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking, absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front DOOR OPENING.
C: ANNIE
D: Miss Daniels? Is that you?
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
E: O.S.
N: Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:
C: ANNIE
D: Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
E: seeing her face
C: MELANIE
D: No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
E: touching her head
C: ANNIE
D: Would you like some brandy?
E: concerned
C: MELANIE
D: If you have some, I'd...
C: ANNIE
D: I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
N: As Annie gets the brandy:
C: MELANIE
D: No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
E: pause
C: ANNIE
D: All right.
E: she smiles
N: MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.
C: MELANIE
D: Thank you.
C: ANNIE
D: It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
E: sitting opposite her
N: Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, how'd your evening go?
N: Melanie shrugs.
C: ANNIE
D: Did you meet Lydia?
N: Melanie nods.
C: ANNIE
D: Or would you rather I changed the subject?
C: MELANIE
D: I think so.
E: with a tired smile
C: ANNIE
D: How do you like our little hamlet?
E: nodding
C: MELANIE
D: I despise it.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
E: laughing
C: MELANIE
D: Where are you from originally, Annie?
C: ANNIE
D: San Francisco.
C: MELANIE
D: How'd you happen to come here?
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
N: There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.
C: ANNIE
D: Look, I see no reason for being coy about this. It was Mitch Brenner.
N: Melanie nods.
C: ANNIE
D: I guess you knew that, anyway.
C: MELANIE
D: I suspected as much.
C: ANNIE
D: You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
C: MELANIE
D: Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
C: ANNIE
D: Isn't there? Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
E: she shrugs
C: MELANIE
D: What do you mean?
C: ANNIE
D: I think I'll have some of that, too. I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know. And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
E: she pours brandy, drinks, sighs she smiles weakly
C: MELANIE
D: When was this?
C: ANNIE
D: Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.
C: MELANIE
D: Different?
C: ANNIE
D: With Lydia. Did she seem a trifle distant?
E: pause
C: MELANIE
D: A trifle.
E: smiling
C: ANNIE
D: Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
C: ANNIE
D: When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
C: MELANIE
D: And what had you done?
C: ANNIE
D: Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
E: she shakes her head
C: MELANIE
D: Then what was it?
C: ANNIE
D: Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
C: MELANIE
D: Then why did she object to you?
C: ANNIE
D: Because she was afraid.
C: MELANIE
D: Afraid you'd take Mitch?
C: ANNIE
D: Afraid I'd give Mitch.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't understand.
C: ANNIE
D: Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
C: MELANIE
D: Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
C: ANNIE
D: No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see. She's only afraid of being abandoned.
C: MELANIE
D: Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
C: ANNIE
D: She already has a daughter.
C: MELANIE
D: What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
C: ANNIE
D: I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
E: apologetically
C: MELANIE
D: I see.
C: ANNIE
D: So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
C: MELANIE
D: Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
C: ANNIE
D: You get straight to the point, don't you?
C: MELANIE
D: I'm sorry. Forgive me.
C: ANNIE
D: No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
C: MELANIE
D: I did.
C: ANNIE
D: Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time. That's the first reason.
E: pause she sighs
C: MELANIE
D: And the second?
C: ANNIE
D: I wanted to be near Mitch. It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway. You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
E: simply pause she smiles
N: There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it. CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE at the phone.
C: ANNIE
D: Hello? Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't asleep. What is it? Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, hold on. It's Mitch. For you.
E: pause she turns to Melanie
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie hesitating.
C: ANNIE
D: He's waiting.
N: Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie talks to Mitch in the background. Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.
C: MELANIE
D: Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, thank you. No, no trouble at all. I simply followed the road. It's a very bright night. What? Oh. Well, there's no need to apologize. I can understand... Well... That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry. I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get back to San Francisco. No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but... I see. I see. Well, if you really... All right. Yes, I'll be there. Good night, Mitch.
E: at phone; coolly pause pause; she listens she listens again she listens pause pause she is warming pause pause
N: She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.
C: MELANIE
D: He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. I said I would.
E: pause
C: ANNIE
D: I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
C: MELANIE
D: It seems so pointless. I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day. My luggage.
E: she sighs picking up her paper bag
N: She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.
C: ANNIE
D: Pretty. Did you get that at Brinkmeyer's?
N: Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent for a moment, pensive. Then:
C: MELANIE
D: Do you think I should go?
C: ANNIE
D: That's up to you.
C: MELANIE
D: It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
C: ANNIE
D: Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
E: firmly
C: ANNIE
D: Then go.
N: The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.
C: MELANIE
D: Thank you, Annie.
N: Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, startling them both.
C: ANNIE
D: Who can that be at this hour? Who is it? Is someone there?
E: rising she walks to door no answer
N: Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night. There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.
C: ANNIE
D: Is anyone there?
E: to the emptiness outside
C: MELANIE
D: Look.
E: pointing to the ground
N: CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
C: ANNIE
D: Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
E: sympathetically
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up. And then, slowly:
C: MELANIE
D: But... it isn't dark, Annie. There's a full moon.
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and consternation:
T: FADE OUT FADE IN
N: HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are clustered around a long folding table upon which are sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either helping the children to more or telling them they are having too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the CAMERA out to the left. CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.
C: MELANIE
D: I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
C: MITCH
D: I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
C: MELANIE
D: I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
C: MITCH
D: Cheers.
E: with a shrug
C: MELANIE
D: Cheers.
N: They drink.
C: MELANIE
D: What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
C: MITCH
D: Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
C: MELANIE
D: Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
C: MITCH
D: You have a job?
E: surprised
C: MELANIE
D: I have several jobs.
E: sipping at the martini
C: MITCH
D: What do you do?
C: MELANIE
D: I do different things on different days.
C: MITCH
D: Like what?
C: MELANIE
D: On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
E: hesitating
C: MITCH
D: Helping travelers.
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
N: She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really considered before what she does with her time, and now that she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and unimportant.
C: MELANIE
D: And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley. That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
C: MITCH
D: What about Thursdays and Fridays?
C: MELANIE
D: On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch. I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
E: pause she shrugs
C: MITCH
D: And Fridays? What do you do then?
C: MELANIE
D: Nothing. I go to bird shops on Fridays.
E: she smiles
C: MITCH
D: I'm glad you do.
C: MELANIE
D: Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
C: MITCH
D: What?
C: MELANIE
D: I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced. She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
E: she does an imitation
C: MITCH
D: What'll it say?
C: MELANIE
D: You'll think me very bold, sir.
E: facetiously
C: MITCH
D: No, tell me.
N: She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into Melanie's face. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE serious, introspective.
C: MELANIE
D: That's silly, isn't it? Teaching a bird to shock my aunt. That's just silly and childish. Maybe I ought to go join the other children.
E: slight pause
N: FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold from Michele to Cathy. CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back. During this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is watching Mitch and Melanie. MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V. MED. SHOT - ANNIE CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy off.
C: ANNIE
D: All right then, here we go. Once! Twice! Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!
E: she spins her she spins her again she spins her again
N: She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees. Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:
C: LITTLE BOY
D: Look! Look!
E: O.S.
N: Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as she looks up. LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V. A gull is swooping down. CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.
C: CATHY
D: No touching allowed!
N: She almost falls. FULL SHOT - THE GULL seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then returns. CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy. MED. SHOT - ANNIE with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as she ducks with two gulls swooping by. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA hurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round to the front of it. FULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V. Annie rising from the ground. Cathy and the other children are running in the background. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA reacting to two more gulls diving. FULL SHOT - TWO GULLS - LYDIA'S P.O.V. diving toward the children. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA She starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT. MED. SHOT - LYDIA REACHES CATHY She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks. TWO SHOT - TWO MOTHERS as a gull swoops between them. FULL SHOT - MITCH coming out of the house with a broom. TWO GULLS swooping down at the children's heads. MED. SHOT - MITCH swinging at gull and missing. LONG SHOT - LITTLE BOY running toward bank. Gull swooping after him. CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into him. FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH running to the injured boy, who is lying against the bank. THREE SHOT - MELANIE, MITCH AND LITTLE BOY They look up. LONG SHOT - THE GULLS against the sky, flying away in formation. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no longer there. A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to Melanie.
C: MITCH
D: Are you all right?
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
C: ANNIE
D: That's the darnest thing thing I've ever seen in my life.
E: coming over
N: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
C: LYDIA
D: Are they gone?
C: MITCH
D: They're gone, Mother.
N: FULL SHOT - THE LAWN as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck very close by without having injured anyone. All that adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.
C: LYDIA
D: Well... well, is everyone all right?
C: MITCH
D: I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
E: with a small boy
N: GIRL #3 Did you see them? They were hawks! GIRL #4 They were bigger than hawks!
C: ANNIE
D: Children, they were only seagulls.
N: And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before. TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent meaningful glance. BACK TO SCENE
C: CATHY
D: They must have been after the food, Mother.
N: They all turn toward the table. CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE, UNDISTURBED CLOSE SHOT - MITCH eyes narrowed.
C: MITCH
D: They didn't touch anything.
N: BACK TO SCENE

The burnt curtain is still smoldering. Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom wearily. The attack is over.
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND
N: reaching down to pick up a dead bird. MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.
C: MALONE
D: That's a chimney swift, all right.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
C: MITCH
D: We know what it is, Al.
N: FULL SHOT - THE ROOM Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.
C: MALONE
D: Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
C: MITCH
D: Not by the thousands.
C: MALONE
D: No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. Did you have a light burning or something.
E: pause
C: MITCH
D: Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
C: MALONE
D: 'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know. Sure is a peculiar thing.
E: pause
C: MITCH
D: What are we going to do about it, Al?

C: MITCH
D: Well... Well... these birds attacked us.

N: CLOSE SHOT - MALONE slight disbelief on his face.

C: MALONE
D: My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.

E: shrugs he shrugs again
C: MITCH
D: These birds were...
C: MALONE

E: he shrugs
C: LYDIA
D: Tell him about the party.

D: That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
C: MALONE
D: Oh, yeah, yeah. How old is she now?

N: CLOSE SHOT - MALONE considering this.

E: thinking
N: TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA
C: LYDIA
D: The children were playing a game, Al. Those gulls attacked without...
C: MALONE
D: Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty strong word, don't you think? I mean, birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason, you know what I mean? The kids just probably scared them, that's all.
C: LYDIA
D: These birds attacked!
C: MALONE
D: Well, what would you like me to do, Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on any suspicious birds in the area? Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't it?
E: nodding he smiles
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
C: MITCH
D: Does this room look silly?
N: TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
C: MALONE
D: No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that. Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years. You want some help cleaning up?
E: pause pause pause
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH exasperated.

T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
N: Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store. Her hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS VOICES.
C: LYDIA'S VOICE
D: Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to drop Cathy off now.
C: MITCH'S VOICE
D: Okay.
C: LYDIA'S VOICE
D: I'll probably drive over to the Fawcett farm. Do you need anything in town?
C: MITCH'S VOICE
D: No.
N: Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck starting. FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V. as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight. MED. SHOT - MELANIE turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA FOLLOWING. She opens the door.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch?
N: There is no answer.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch?
N: FULL SHOT - MELANIE coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on her face. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds TWEET at her.
C: MELANIE
D: Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.
E: imitating them
N: FULL SHOT - MELANIE leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall. She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then peers out of the side window. LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V. Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin column of smoke is climbing the sky. MED. SHOT - MELANIE carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS. FULL SHOT - MELANIE coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee and then breathes deeply of the air. CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have not seen before. She looks off toward the shore. LONG SHOT - MITCH on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke is climbing the sky. MED. SHOT - MELANIE She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky for a moment. SLOW PAN as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch coming toward her, her eyes glowing. FULL SHOT - MITCH closer to the house now. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE waiting, anticipating. MED. SHOT - MITCH He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face. FULL SHOT - MELANIE as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS again. She turns. Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
C: MITCH
D: I wanted to change my shirt.
N: Melanie is uncomprehending.
C: MITCH
D: It smelled of the fire.
C: MELANIE
D: It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now. I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
E: nodding pause; then sagely
C: MITCH
D: Really? Tell me about it.
C: MELANIE
D: It's an uprising.
E: secretively
C: MITCH
D: Of birds?
C: MELANIE
D: Certainly, of birds.
N: Mitch grins.
C: MELANIE
D: It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
C: MITCH
D: Growing a beard...
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
E: delighted
C: MITCH
D: So they united.
C: MELANIE
D: Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
C: MITCH
D: Well, they'll go along with anything.
C: MELANIE
D: Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
C: MITCH
D: Hear!
C: MELANIE
D: Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
C: MITCH
D: Hear, hear!
C: MELANIE
D: And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
C: MITCH
D: Take wing!
C: MELANIE
D: You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
N: They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly still.
C: MITCH
D: What it was, probably...
E: attempting to be serious
C: MELANIE
D: Mmm?
C: MITCH
D: They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
C: MELANIE
D: With my little sparrow leading team.
N: She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time. Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror story, they are becoming a little frightened.
C: MITCH
D: It's so damn quiet out there.
C: MELANIE
D: It was like that yesterday.
C: MITCH
D: What do you mean?
C: MELANIE
D: After the gulls attacked.
C: MITCH
D: I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
E: pause
C: MELANIE
D: It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
C: MITCH
D: No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
E: trying to make it light again
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE her face dead serious. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
C: MITCH
D: ...waving his little wings...
N: His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the garden is silent. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming slowly and with the chill of horror on them.
C: MELANIE
D: They were angry, Mitch. They came out of the chimney in fury. I had the feeling they wanted each and every one of us dead.
E: pause
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes to him longingly.
C: MITCH
D: Melanie, Melanie...
C: MELANIE
D: I'm frightened, Mitch.
C: MITCH
D: No, no...
C: MELANIE
D: I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
C: MITCH
D: Melanie...
C: MELANIE
D: ...everything I know.
N: She looks up at him suddenly. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
C: MELANIE
D: Oh damn it, why did you have to walk into that shop?
N: They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,

N: LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND FARMHAND No, ma'm. I reckon he's in there, though. MED. SHOT - LYDIA
C: LYDIA
D: Thank you!
E: shouting it
N: FULL SHOT - LYDIA as she crosses the barnyard again. There are several chickens scurrying about. She walks closer to them, sees an open bag of feed lying against the fence. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA getting an idea. MED. SHOT - LYDIA reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the ground.
C: LYDIA
D: Here, chick, chick, chick, chick. Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
N: CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN He struts up to the scattered grain. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA watching him. CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from it and struts off. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett. She turns. FULL SHOT - LYDIA approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.
C: LYDIA
D: Dan?
N: She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent. In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.

S: INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT
N: as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her left and looks down a long corridor. FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V. a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial light into the corridor.
C: LYDIA
D: Dan?
N: No answer. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she should leave. A determined look comes over her face. FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V. as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.
C: LYDIA
D: Dan? Are you in there?
N: No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing the door open. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room. SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V. starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately
T: CUTS TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their empty staring sockets. Immediately
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA a terrified scream erupting from her mouth. FULL SHOT - LYDIA turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway, CAMERA FOLLOWING. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide. FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite direction, swerves, screeches around the curve. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight. FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield, there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and barrels into the front yard. FULL SHOT - MITCH alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck just as it jerks to a stop. MED. SHOT - MITCH through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia.
C: MITCH
D: What is it?

Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.
C: LYDIA
D: Mitch?
E: O.S.
N: FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a life no longer valid. There are photographs of her dead husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing the tray.
C: MELANIE
D: No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
N: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
C: LYDIA
D: Oh, thank you.

C: MELANIE
D: He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
C: LYDIA

D: Do you think Cathy's all right?
C: MELANIE
D: What?
C: LYDIA
D: Cathy. At the school.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA
C: LYDIA
D: Do I sound foolish to you?
C: MELANIE
D: No.

E: she shudders pause
C: MELANIE
D: Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
C: LYDIA
D: I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
C: LYDIA
D: I lost my husband four years ago, you know. It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone. I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep. Do you think Cathy's all right?
E: pause pause pause; the worried look again
C: MELANIE
D: Annie's there. She'll be all right.
C: LYDIA
D: I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children. When Frank died... You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
E: pause pause
C: MELANIE
D: Yes.
C: LYDIA
D: I wish I could be that way.
N: There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her husband's death, is discussing it with another person. Curiously, the person is Melanie.
C: LYDIA
D: I miss him. You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember. I miss talking to him. Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch... ...Mitch has his own life. I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
E: honestly and simply pause pause pause she shrugs a little sadly pause she sighs deeply
C: MELANIE
D: Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
C: LYDIA
D: No. No... don't go yet. I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
E: pause
C: MELANIE
D: Why, Mrs. Brenner?
C: LYDIA
D: Because my son is... My son seems to be fond of you. And I... I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
E: pause pause pause
C: MELANIE
D: Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
C: LYDIA
D: Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
C: MELANIE
D: And if you don't?
C: LYDIA
D: Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
E: with a faint smile
C: MELANIE
D: I think it might also matter to Mitch.
C: LYDIA
D: Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do. I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man. But... You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone. I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset. I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
E: shaking her head pause pause
C: MELANIE
D: Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
E: going to the bed; adjusting the pillow
C: LYDIA
D: I wish I were stronger. Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
E: sighing she pauses and looks toward the window.
C: MELANIE
D: Would you like me to go for her?
C: LYDIA
D: I couldn't ask you to.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't mind, really.
C: LYDIA
D: Would you? I'd feel so much better.
C: MELANIE
D: I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
N: She picks up the tray and starts for the door.
C: LYDIA
D: Melanie?
N: At the door, Melanie turns. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA her face soft.
C: LYDIA

There is no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is drawn to something above her. MED. SHOT - SKY A crows is coming down. CLOSE UP - MELANIE as her eyes follow the flight of the crow. MED. SHOT - SKY Crow moving down and LEFT to RIGHT, the sky and Annie's roof in the background.

N: The children modulate into silence.
C: ANNIE
D: Miss Daniels wants to see how we conduct ourselves during a fire drill. I'd like you to...
C: CHILDREN

C: ANNIE
D: I'd like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be.
N: The children again fall silent.
C: ANNIE

C: ANNIE
D: I want you to go as quietly as you can, not a sound, until I tell you to run. And then I want you to run as fast as you can. Does everyone understand? All right. John, would you lead the class, please?

T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT
N: It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing and clowning around throughout following at a table in the rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens. Over her head, the television set is blasting with its perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.
C: MELANIE
D: Daddy, there were hundreds of them. No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying to tell you this as calmly as I know how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy. Just now. Not... fifteen minutes ago.
E: she takes a deep breath
N: The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what Melanie is saying.
C: MELANIE
D: At the school. No, I don't. Just a minute. What's the name of the school?
E: to Deke
C: DEKE
D: Just the Bodega Bay School. Help you, Mrs. Bundy?
E: to Mrs. Bundy
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: I need some change, Mr. Carter.
N: As Deke opens cash register...
C: MELANIE
D: The Bodega Bay School. Could you turn that down, please?
E: to Deke
N: Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't know how many children. Thirty or forty. Yes.
N: Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to Melanie.
C: MELANIE
D: No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
E: turning from machine
C: MELANIE
D: They're different, Daddy. Thank you. I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them. Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right. No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope... I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
E: to Mrs. Bundy into phone exasperated pause pause
N: She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
C: MELANIE
D: Thank you. Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
E: to Deke
C: DEKE
D: In the book right here, Miss.
N: As Melanie looks it up...
C: DEKE
D: I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
E: to Mrs. Bundy
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
E: with a superior smile
C: MELANIE
D: I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
E: dialing
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
C: HELEN
D: Three Southern fried chicken, Sam. Baked potato on all of them.
E: going to door leading to kitchen
N: LAUGHTER from salesman at table.
C: MELANIE
D: Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please? Yes, I'll wait.
E: into phone pause
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: ...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
E: continuing to Deke
C: DEKE
D: Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Impossible.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch? I'm glad I caught you. Something terrible has happened.
E: in background
N: Her background conversation continues through following:
C: DRUNK
D: It's the end of the world!
E: suddenly
C: HELEN
D: What's this about the school?
C: DEKE
D: Bunch of crows attacked the school, Helen.
C: DRUNK
D: It's the end of the world. "Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
E: suddenly quoting
C: HELEN
D: The Lord's not destroying anything, Jason.
C: DRUNK
D: "In all your dwelling places, the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be laid waste!" Ezekiel, Chapter six.
E: he nods
C: HELEN
D: "Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink."
E: quoting
C: DRUNK
D: Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of the world.
E: nodding
C: MELANIE
D: Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
E: she hangs up
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
E: laughing
C: MELANIE
D: These weren't a few birds.
E: turning to her
N: CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation; becoming very nervous. BACK TO SCENE
C: DEKE
D: I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
N: CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES eating.
C: SHOLES
D: How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
E: suddenly, from his table
N: BACK TO SCENE
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
C: SHOLES
D: The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
C: MELANIE
D: Have you had trouble with gulls?
E: leaping upon this
C: SHOLES
D: One of my boats did last week.
C: DEKE
D: This young lady got hit by a gull only Saturday.
E: making a connection
C: SAM'S VOICE
D: Pick up the chicken.
E: from kitchen
C: HELEN
D: Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was crows. Deke, I'm still waiting for those Bloody Marys!
E: she picks up tray, shrugs, goes to table
C: DEKE
D: Coming right up!
N: CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really frightened.
C: WOMAN
D: Could you ask them to lower their voices, please? They're frightening the children.
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: Timmy has a canary.
C: HELEN
D: That's nice. Are you Timmy?
C: LITTLE BOY
D: My cousin is Timmy.
N: BACK TO SCENE
C: SAM'S VOICE
D: A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized one of my boats. Practically tore of the skipper's arm.
E: leaving table, coming to bar
C: HELEN
D: You're scaring the kids. Keep it low.
E: coming back
C: DEKE
D: You're scaring me, too. Are you trying to say all these... That sounds impossible, Sebastian.
E: he shakes his head
C: SHOLES
D: I'm only telling you what happened to my boat.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
C: MELANIE
D: What were the crows after at the school?
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: What do you think they were after, Miss...?
C: MELANIE
D: Daniels. I think they were after the children.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: For what purpose?
C: MELANIE
D: To... To kill them.
E: she hesitates
N: There is a long silence.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Why?
N: Another silence.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't know why.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
N: A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
C: MELANIE
D: No one called it a war!
C: SALESMAN
D: Scotch, light on the water.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
C: HELEN
D: Are you finished here, Sebastian?
C: SHOLES
D: Let me have some apple pie, Helen. Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
E: to Mrs. Bundy
C: HELEN
D: One apple pie! You want more coffee?
E: yelling to kitchen
C: SHOLES
D: No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
C: SALESMAN
D: Your captain should have shot at them.
C: SHOLES
D: What?
C: SALESMAN
D: Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are. If you ask me, we should wipe them all out. World would be better off without them.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Birds?
E: outraged
C: SALESMAN
D: Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: We need them.
C: SALESMAN
D: Not if they're starting a war.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: They are incapable of organized warfare!
C: MELANIE
D: Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
C: MELANIE
D: Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
C: SALESMAN
D: Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: That would hardly be possible.
C: DEKE
D: Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
C: SALESMAN
D: Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
E: muttering
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: ...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
C: DRUNK
D: It's the end of the world!
C: DEKE
D: Well, we seem to have more than our share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy. Maybe this young lady's right. Maybe they've all gone crazy.
C: HELEN
D: Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
C: SHOLES
D: No. Here's fine.
E: he begins eating
C: HELEN
D: Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
C: DEKE
D: Coming.
C: HELEN
D: Are we running a business here -- or a bird sanctuary?
E: angrily
C: SHOLES
D: Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
E: beginning to change his mind
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Of course.
C: SHOLES
D: Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
C: DRUNK
D: Cockroaches! Urghh!
N: CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN getting more and more anxious.
C: WOMAN
D: Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.
C: BOY
D: Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?
C: SHOLES
D: Maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this. Admittedly, a few birds acted strangely. That's no reason to believe...
C: MELANIE
D: This isn't a few birds! I keep telling you that! These are gulls and swifts and crows and...
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
C: MELANIE
D: Maybe! Is it impossible?
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable. Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
E: laughing
C: SHOLES
D: We couldn't. You're right, Mrs. Bundy.
C: WOMAN
D: Excuse me, may I have a check, please?
E: calling from table
C: HELEN
D: Is everything all right, ma'am?
E: concerned
C: WOMAN
D: Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the road.
C: SAM
D: What's the matter? Something wrong out here?
E: coming from kitchen
C: DEKE
D: Nothing's wrong.
C: SAM
D: All this shouting.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: We're fighting a war, Sam.
C: SAM
D: A war? Against who? Did the Russians...?
C: SHOLES
D: Against birds.
C: WOMAN
D: I'm glad you all think this is so amusing. You've frightened my children half out of their wits.
E: suddenly
C: BOY
D: I'm not scared, Mommy.
C: WOMAN
D: Keep quiet. If that young lady saw an attack on the school, why won't you believe her?
C: SAM
D: What attack? Who attacked the school?
C: WOMAN
D: Birds did. Crows! And you're all sitting around here debating! What do you want them to do next? Crash through that window?
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: Mommy!
E: frightened by her mother
C: WOMAN
D: Quiet! Why don't you all get home? Lock your doors and windows! Put on your coats, children! What's the fastest road to San Francisco?
E: her hysteria rising to Deke
C: DEKE
D: The freeway, ma'am.
C: WOMAN
D: Where do I get it?
C: SALESMAN
D: I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
C: WOMAN
D: Then let's go. Now!
C: SALESMAN
D: I haven't finished my drink.
C: WOMAN
D: Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
E: on edge of panic, shouting at her children
C: BOY
D: I can't find my scarf.
C: WOMAN
D: Look in your sleeve!
N: The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.
C: MITCH
D: Melanie?
N: At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.
C: MITCH
D: I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
E: going to her
C: MELANIE
D: At Annie's house. She's all right.
C: SAM
D: Al, why aren't you over there where the attack was?
C: MALONE
D: Because I just got back from Dan Fawcett's place, that's why.
C: MITCH
D: He was killed last night. By birds.
C: MALONE
D: Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: What are the facts, Mr. Malone?
C: MALONE
D: Santa Rosa police think it was a felony murder. They think a burglar broke in and killed him.
C: WOMAN
D: Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today? Are you coming?
E: impatiently, to salesman
C: SALESMAN
D: Take it easy, lady. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
E: through window
C: DRUNK
D: "Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow or read, yet your heavenly father feeds them."
E: quoting
C: WOMAN
D: I'll never feed another bird as long as I live!
C: SALESMAN
D: Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
C: WOMAN
D: Can't you please finish your drink?
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
C: SALESMAN
D: They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
E: shaking his head
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
C: WOMAN
D: I'm leaving! Are you coming?
C: SALESMAN
D: All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks.
E: he downs his drink
C: DRUNK
D: It's the end of the world.
N: The Tides is silent for a moment.
C: SHOLES
D: Well, I'd better get back to the cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?
C: DEKE
D: Let's see. Scallops and coffee...
C: MITCH
D: Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.
N: Sholes turns to him. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH his face very serious.
C: MITCH
D: Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
C: SHOLES
D: No one ever said you were, Mitch.
C: MITCH
D: I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
E: flatly
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Ignore what? The bird war?
E: sarcastically
C: MITCH
D: Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, the bird plague, you can call it what you want to, they're out there massing someplace and they'll be back, you can count on that!
E: exploding
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Ridiculous!
C: MITCH
D: Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home and polish your binoculars?
C: SAM
D: Go on, Mitch.
C: MITCH
D: If we don't do something now, if we don't get Bodega Bay on the move...
C: SHOLES
D: Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
C: MITCH
D: Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
C: SHOLES
D: No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
E: after a long pause
C: MITCH
D: It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
C: SHOLES
D: I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...
E: thoughtfully he shakes his head
C: MITCH
D: Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
C: SHOLES
D: Help how? What do you want to do?
C: MITCH
D: I'm not sure, but...
C: SHOLES
D: If you don't even know what you want to do...
C: MELANIE
D: Listen to him, please.
C: SAM
D: You listen to him, Sebastian!
E: taking position beside Melanie
C: MITCH
D: I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
C: SHOLES
D: How?
C: MITCH
D: Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
C: DEKE
D: We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
C: MITCH
D: We'll make our own fog.
C: SHOLES
D: How do you plan to do that?
C: MITCH
D: With smoke.
C: MALONE
D: There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
C: MITCH
D: We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
C: DEKE
D: What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: Birds are not bad!
C: SHOLES
D: How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
C: MITCH
D: Can we go on living here otherwise?
N: Pause. They are silent.
C: SAM
D: It's worth a try, Sebastian.
E: slowly
N: There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:
C: MELANIE
D: Look!
N: They turn toward the window. TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the window and out to the left.
C: DEKE
D: Gulls!
E: alarmed
C: MITCH
D: They're back!
C: SHOLES
D: They're only the usual... What are you...
N: TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is seen disappearing into the men's room.
S: INT. TIDES
N: A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the Tides Restaurant. TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep by. The gas begins to flow away. MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas station. At the door, Mitch turns.
C: MITCH
D: Stay back in here.
E: to Melanie
N: Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch. They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to rescue the attacked gas station attendant. Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks down. TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is flowing to the right into the car park. CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE flowing down to the car park. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station. MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS along the flowing gas back to the station. CLOSEUP - MELANIE She turns back to the car park. FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar. CLOSEUP - MELANIE She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the man. FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and he drops it. CLOSEUP - MELANIE Her horror-stricken face. FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's car, and the one next to it go up in flames. CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE TURNING TO SEE FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured attendant.
S: EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT
N: A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the town rushing around the car park and the streets across the highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop down on the town.
S: EXT. TIDES TOWN
N: A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch...! Mitch!
N: We see her look up to the sky. LONG SHOT - THE SKY The sky is full of seagulls. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in the phone booth. CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all around her.
S: EXT. TIDES TOWN
N: From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with clouds of birds coming on them. CLOSEUP - MELANIE looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her eyes for Mitch. MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES CLOSEUP - MELANIE in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the direction of the car park.
S: EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
N: Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds. CLOSEUP - MELANIE Her eyes turn up quickly. LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds. Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.
S: EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT
N: We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner coming toward her in the phone booth. We can see birds flying in and out of the windows of the car. We can see the arm and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive. CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE as the car comes toward her in the booth.
S: EXT. TIDES TOWN
N: At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth. CLOSER SHOT A side view of the car after practically scraping the side of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently give us a view of its interior. FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE watching the car.
S: EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
N: The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It explodes. CLOSEUP - MELANIE Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns. TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight turn, now sees: THE TIDES TOWN The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop their hose. CLOSER SHOT shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows of the phone booth. CLOSEUP - MELANIE recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and leaping and kicking its van to pieces. At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows. His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight. Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and waving the birds away from them with flailing arms. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls crash around the booth causing her to go back. CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE looking out again toward Mitch.
S: EXT. TIDES TOWN
N: Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station. Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the smoking building. CLOSEUP - MELANIE looking across in horror. LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the window as Mitch drops the child. FLASH - MELANIE watching this breathlessly. CLOSER SHOT The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up. He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the windows. They disappear into the building. CLOSEUP - MELANIE holding her breath. LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING No sign of Mitch. CLOSEUP - MELANIE getting more desperate. CLOSEUP - BUILDING No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE opening the door of the booth, yells out to him. LONG SHOT - MITCH sees her and starts running toward the booth. HIGH SHOT - MITCH beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth. LOW SHOT close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.
S: INT. THE TIDES
N: There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside. There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a woman's voice SCREAMS out:
C: WOMAN
D: Why are they doing it?! Why are they doing it...?!
N: Some of the heads of the group turn. CLOSE SHOT It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs. Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some words.
C: MRS. BUNDY
D: 
E: [Mrs. Bundy offers a weak explanation of why the birds could have gone berserk like this. This information should be obtained from Dr. Stager.]
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.
C: MITCH
D: I think they're going.
E: looking up
N: Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly. MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the street.
C: MITCH
D: I think it's safe to get out now.
C: MELANIE
D: Don't let's take any chances.
C: MITCH
D: We've got to get Cathy.
N: They open the door and make their way out into the street, running and looking about them desperately.
S: EXT. BODIGA STREET
N: There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the sidewalk.
S: EXT. BODIGA STREET
N: There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as they move along past the last street and come into the more countrified part of the town. LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the school roof. SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks up, Melanie following his look. SKY SHOT - FULL of wheeling gulls. SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt. LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT There are a few blackbirds on it.
C: MELANIE'S VOICE
D: Look... the crows again.
N: CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.
C: MELANIE
D: Careful, Mitch. The crows may be back in the play yard.
N: CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play yard, we see what they see. MED. SHOT THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of crows. CLOSE SHOT They walk stealthily past. CLOSE SHOT CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows. CLOSE SHOT Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over her shoulder toward the crows.
S: EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE
N: Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop. LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the door. MED. SHOT - MITCH He reaches the body. He rolls it over. QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE dead. QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH The shock registering on his face. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment what Mitch's reaction will be. MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V. He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to keep her warm. He turns away then. MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign, with her eyes peering at something outside. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH turning to follow Cathy's gaze. CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers. FULL SHOT - THE ROAD As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at the birds. Melanie dashes forward.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch! Don't!
E: as the birds flutter into the air
N: She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are now hovering flight.
C: MELANIE
D: Please! Get Cathy! Let's get out of here!
N: Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds Cathy to her. CLOSER THREE SHOT as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch, you can't leave her out there.
N: He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and then a door is CLOSED. MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V. We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA. MED. SHOT He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the three of them as they silently make their way past the crows once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out cautiously to the right. MED. SHOT CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again. BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them. MED. SHOT Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows. CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go toward the waiting car. MED. SHOT They arrive at the car.
C: MELANIE
D: You drive, Mitch.
N: She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the CAMERA and goes down the school road. FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie looks over her shoulder.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't think they're coming.
E: holding her breath
N: Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.
C: CATHY
D: On our way back from taking Michele home... we... we heard the explosion and went outside to... see what... what it was. All at once the... the birds were everywhere. All at once. She... she pushed me inside and... they covered her. Annie. She pushed me inside.
E: pause pause pause
N: TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.
T: DISSOLVE
N: CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the Brenner house in the distance. FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay. LONG SHOT - THE BAY covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds. MED. SHOT - MITCH picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where the ladder leans against the side of the house. FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.
C: MELANIE
D: The town looks clear.
C: MITCH
D: The bay doesn't.
C: MELANIE
D: How long have they been gathering there?
C: MITCH
D: The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
E: pause
N: Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.
C: MELANIE
D: I keep thinking of Annie.
E: she squeezes her eyes shut
C: MITCH
D: It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
E: after a long pause
C: MELANIE
D: Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
E: looking
C: MITCH
D: It may not be last week again for a long long time.
N: They are both silent.
C: MELANIE
D: Look. They're still coming.
N: Mitch nods. Silence.
C: MITCH
D: Do you want to try your father again?
E: Melanie shakes her head. Puzzled, Mitch looks at her
C: MELANIE
D: I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
C: MITCH
D: Have we still got power?
C: MELANIE
D: Yes. I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
E: leaning against him
C: LYDIA
D: Mitch! I'm getting something on the radio!
E: O.S.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT
N: Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them
C: LYDIA
D: I can't get any of the local stations. I think this is San Francisco.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: ...would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project. A vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning.
N: TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH listening.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area. The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals unquote. In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town. On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that...
E: pause pause
C: MITCH
D: Is that all?
C: ANNOUNCER
D: ...drew a standing ovation for the President. The Chief Executive, in discussing our relation to Europe and the rest of the world community said: "These various elements of our foreign policy lead as I have said to a single goal --
E: O.S.
C: MITCH
D: We're going to need more wood for the fire. We can't let it go out.
E: sighing
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states. This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future -- a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age. We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our lifetime. But the quest is the great adventure of our century. We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility. In assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did when I first took office. For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of...
E: continuing as drone in background pause pause
C: LYDIA
D: Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
E: pause
C: MITCH
D: I got them all, Mother.
C: LYDIA
D: When do you think they'll come?
C: MITCH
D: I don't know.
C: LYDIA
D: If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
C: MITCH
D: That's a chance we have to take.
C: LYDIA
D: Maybe we ought to leave.
C: MITCH
D: Not now. Not while they're massing out there.
C: LYDIA
D: When?
C: MITCH
D: I don't know when. We'll see what...
C: LYDIA
D: Where will we go?
C: MITCH
D: I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in.
E: Pause
C: LYDIA
D: What happens when we run out of wood?
N: Music begins to play. The music is sweet, with violins and long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the tension being played in front of it.
C: MITCH
D: I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
C: LYDIA
D: You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
E: shouting
C: CATHY
D: Mother!
E: shrieking it, her face white
C: LYDIA
D: If your father were here...
E: at Mitch
C: MITCH
D: Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...
E: sharply shaking his head
C: LYDIA
D: I'm sorry, Mitch.
E: trembling, nodding
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH the strain showing on his face. He nods briefly.
C: MITCH
D: Let's get the wood. Why don't you make us all some coffee, Mother?
N: FULL SHOT - HOUSE as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood. There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly scan the sky. FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS flying in tight formation. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
C: MELANIE
D: Where are they heading?
C: MITCH
D: Inland.
C: MELANIE
D: Santa Rosa?
C: MITCH
D: Maybe.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.
C: MITCH
D: Come on. Let's get this wood in.
E: O.S. gently
N: Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and her eyes remain on the sky.
T: DISSOLVE
N: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch. There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room and dumps another load.
C: MELANIE
D: That's the last of it.
C: LYDIA
D: Did you close the door?
C: MELANIE
D: And locked it.
C: CATHY
D: Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
C: LYDIA
D: No!
E: snapping it
C: CATHY
D: Mom, they're in a cage!
C: LYDIA
D: They're birds!
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.
C: MITCH
D: Let them stay in the other room.
E: softly
N: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA her hand trembling as she pours the coffee. FULL SHOT - THE ROOM as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in the house.
C: CATHY
D: Mitch? Why are they doing this? The birds.
C: MITCH
D: I don't know, honey.
E: putting wood on fire
C: CATHY
D: Why are they trying to kill people?
C: MITCH
D: I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
N: The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall silent. CLOSE SHOT - CATHY turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, her eyes widening. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE waiting. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA waiting. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH waiting. FULL SHOT - THE ROOM dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of splintering glass.
C: LYDIA
D: Mitch...
C: MITCH
D: Shhh. Shhh.
N: Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence. More panes of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards and the outside of the house begins building, almost like muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the roof. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She squeezes her eyes shut. TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds, there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat- tat. Tat-
C: CATHY
D: I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I want to throw...
E: in terror
N: Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.
C: MELANIE
D: I'll go with you.
N: They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of birds striking the house. FULL SHOT - THE ROOM Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds. CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes? He cannot tell. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns. MED. SHOT - MITCH coming into the entry hall. CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside assail the door. FULL SHOT - MITCH turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.
C: MELANIE
D: When will they stop?
C: MITCH
D: I thought they'd have stopped by now.
C: MELANIE
D: What time is it?
C: MITCH
D: Almost two a.m.
C: MELANIE
D: You must be exhausted.
C: MITCH
D: How about you?
N: She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the chair, goes to the cage. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH looking at the birds, wondering. CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their expressions. Malice or benevolence? MED. SHOT - MITCH He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage. CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS watching, unmoving. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving. One of them tweets. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
C: MITCH
D: I wonder if Cathy fed them.
N: He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, takes out a small box of bird feed. CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him. His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door. Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage. The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, tweeting, they begin to eat. FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms. Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.
C: MITCH
D: You should have left when you wanted to.
E: holding her
N: She shakes her head.
C: MITCH
D: You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
C: MELANIE
D: I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
N: There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.
C: MITCH
D: The power.
E: in the darkness
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch...
C: MITCH
D: Wait here. Don't move.
N: The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes on. TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as he directs the beam upwards.
C: MITCH
D: We'd better light some of those lamps.
C: MELANIE
D: No... wait. Hold me.
E: pause
N: In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is almost black in the room except for the strange effect of the flashlight as he holds it behind her.
C: MITCH
D: I think they're easing off.
T: DISSOLVE
N: FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs. Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a steady dribbling, difficult to place. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch?
E: whispering
N: MED. SHOT - MELANIE as she turns toward him.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch?
E: still whispering
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH asleep. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, picks up a very long flashlight. FULL SHOT - MELANIE as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, goes to the windows, plays the beam on them. Everything's all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves. FULL SHOT - MELANIE climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back toward the door when she stops. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE looking. CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR a pile of chipped and broken plaster. MED. SHOT - MELANIE turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling. CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, and suddenly, her eyes open wide. CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL sitting in the darkness, staring at her. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE reacting. QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL wings spread in the beam of light. FULL SHOT - MELANIE backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the FULL SHOT - THE CEILING a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward her. MED. SHOT - MELANIE in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds attack her. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face. MED. SHOT - MELANIE swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.
C: MITCH
D: Melanie!
E: O.S.
N: FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering wings.
C: MITCH
D: Melanie, open the door!
E: O.S.
N: He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed by the birds. She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault on the door by Mitch outside.
C: LYDIA
D: Mitch, get her out of there!
E: O.S. screaming
N: MED. SHOT - THE ROOM Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.
C: MITCH
D: Melanie!
E: O.S.
N: The door begins to open. FULL SHOT - MITCH as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room. He begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding. We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.
C: MITCH
D: Mother, get a rope!
C: LYDIA
D: Oh, my God, look at her!
C: MITCH
D: Get a rope!
E: shouting
N: She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds. There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his hand, knocking the club from it. MED. SHOT - MITCH as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob. Another bird flutters into the corridor. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and is immediately attacked by the other bird.
C: MITCH
D: Mother! Hurry!
E: yelling
N: TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia following. As they go downstairs:
C: MITCH
D: Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
C: CATHY
D: Is she all right?
E: at the foot of the stars, on the verge of tears
N: CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.
C: MELANIE
D: I'm... I'm....
N: FULL SHOT - MITCH as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the couch.
C: MITCH
D: Just lie there and keep still.
N: Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket. By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands are trembling, and he drops it.
C: LYDIA
D: Let me do that, Mitch.
N: She picks up the bandage.
C: MITCH
D: I can handle it.
C: LYDIA
D: I know you can. But I'd like to.
E: her eyes meet his
N: He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.
C: MELANIE
D: Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
E: weakly
C: LYDIA
D: Shhhh. Shhhh.
C: MELANIE
D: Please.
N: But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.
C: LYDIA
D: I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
E: as she works
C: MITCH
D: You're doing fine.
C: LYDIA
D: I mean. I want to...
E: Apologizing
N: Pause.
C: CATHY
D: Listen!
N: CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to hear.
C: LYDIA
D: They're gone. God have mercy, they're gone.
N: FULL SHOT - MITCH as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the table and chair. He opens the door a crack. FULL SHOT - THE YARD through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no birds visible. FULL SHOT - THE DOOR from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is directly behind him. FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE a shambles, all the windows broken. TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
C: MITCH
D: They're gone. The same pattern.
C: LYDIA
D: But they'll be back.
C: MITCH
D: We won't be here.
C: LYDIA
D: Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
C: MITCH
D: I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
C: LYDIA
D: We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
E: shaking her head
C: MITCH
D: We have to try it. We can't stay here. Melanie needs help. Mother, the house won't take another attack.
E: a long silence silence silence
C: LYDIA
D: If... If... when we get to San Francisco... If they're already there?
E: pause pause
C: MITCH
D: They won't be.
C: LYDIA
D: If they are?
C: MITCH
D: We'll worry about that when we get there.
C: LYDIA
D: I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
C: MITCH
D: What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
C: LYDIA
D: I started to say... inside...
E: nodding; then after a pause
C: MITCH
D: You don't have to.
N: He holds out his hand to her.
C: MITCH
D: I think we'd better get started.
T: DISSOLVE
N: FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the house. CLOSE SHOT - CATHY She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH looking back at her. FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA Across the expanse of the desolated yard.
C: CATHY
D: May I take them, Mitch?
N: He does not answer. She continues looking at him.
C: CATHY
D: They haven't harmed anyone.
C: LYDIA
D: Take them.
C: MITCH
D: We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.
E: with a slow nod
N: He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car. The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, and looks toward the trees. MED. SHOT - THE TREES covered with waiting birds. MED. SHOT - MITCH getting into car.
C: MITCH
D: Be careful with that door.
N: Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch does the same with his door.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
E: weakly
C: MITCH
D: We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. Are you ready?
E: pause
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND turning the key. The motor springs to life.
S: FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
N: anticipation on all the faces.
C: MITCH
D: All right. Here we go.
E: he takes a deep breath
N: FULL SHOT - THE CAR from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it passes the gate and starts down the road. MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact. The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the road. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW She gasps quickly. MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE standing, waiting silently. FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR as the tension begins to starts.
C: MITCH
D: Shhh. Shhhh.
N: MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with waiting seagulls. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH turning toward the side of the road ahead. FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V. covered with waiting birds.
C: CATHY
D: Mitch, let's turn back.
E: whispering
C: MITCH
D: Shhh. Shhhhh.
N: MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap. CLOSE SHOT - CATHY reacting. FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V. as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still- standing wires, watching, waiting. FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every pole, on every fence.
C: LYDIA
D: Mitch!
N: MED. SHOT - MITCH as he stops the car and looks ahead. FULL SHOT - THE CAR in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE frightened, try not to reveal her fear.
C: MELANIE
D: Can we turn back?
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
C: MITCH
D: I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
S: FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
N: There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, who makes the decision.
C: MELANIE
D: Then go ahead, Mitch.
S: FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR
N: as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA as she turns to look out the window on her side. CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS as the car moves past them slowly. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA closing her eyes. FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken windows. TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH The tension on their faces, MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere, waiting. CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his arms. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH strained, looking at the road ahead. LONG SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD a clear sky, a bird-free stretch, CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
C: MITCH
D: Here we go.
E: almost as a prayer he rams down on the accelerator
N: FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead in a burst of speed. FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS taking wing. MED. SHOT - MORE BIRDS taking wing. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE screaming.
C: MELANIE
D: Mitch!
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend. FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing immediately ahead. CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD from the inside, as birds flutter against it. CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR from the inside, as a beak slashes it, letting in a thin line of light. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH wrenching at the wheel again, another bend. HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it in straight lines. TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over their heads, letting in more light. CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF More slashes, more light in scattered beams. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the owl. CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
C: LYDIA
D: Dear God... dear God... please, please, what have we done? Please. Can't they leave us alone? LEAVE US ALONE!
E: almost a prayer and then in anger at the roof and the birds shrieking it
N: MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof suddenly rips back. FULL SHOT - BIRDS from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof tears back. CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds, and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder. TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close. FULL SHOT - THE CAR racing along as the birds hover over it. CLOSE SHOT - MITCH his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal. FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in the road. FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD) It is arrow-straight, no curves. FULL SHOT - THE CAR in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They are well ahead of the birds now. CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
C: LYDIA
D: We're losing them.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MITCH only a nod, his face streaming tears. LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.) as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the distance. TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening, looks ahead through the windshield. FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all their faces visible.
C: CATHY
D: Mitch? Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
C: MITCH
D: I think they'll be all right, honey.
E: with the faintest smile
N: There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension. They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches up to turn down the sun visor.
C: MITCH
D: It looks... it looks clear up ahead.
N: FULL SHOT - THE CAR moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the distance it goes.
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
