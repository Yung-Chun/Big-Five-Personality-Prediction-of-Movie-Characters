T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. MIAMI - OCEAN AVE, SOUTH BEACH - DAY
N: Blazing sun. MUSIC everywhere. Everybody's living la vida.
C: LEOPOLD
D: And we're good to go. TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts, walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean. Adjust their EARPIECES.
E: V.0.
C: LEOPOLD
D: Proceed to first checkpoint and hold. They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto the Promenade. Under fat shady palm trees, to a CLEARING --
E: V.0.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE ROOF OF THE BEACON HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
N: AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike.
C: LEOPOLD
D: Okay sit tight. Company's coming. THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW --
C: LEOPOLD
D: Shit. Hang on. Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS --
N: LEOPOLD WHOA -- The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas, getting nearer; steal a look at the roof...
T: CUT TO:
N: POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off her like diamonds in the sunlight.
C: STEARNS
D: Oh, mama. She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve.
C: LEOPOLD
D: She sure is taking her time...
C: STEARNS
D: She must be really salty...
C: LEOPOLD
D: It's not just the salt. She's got sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on that, and it sticks... Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And these three models --
E: shakes his head then still watching
C: STEARNS
D: Wait a minute. Hawaii.
E: looks at him
C: LEOPOLD
D: -- Shit! He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot --
C: DAVE
D: Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something like this ever happened to you? (bends down to pet
C: THE CHIHUAHUA)
D: Because if you're a guy - or if you know someone who is - then what you've just seen should look pretty familiar. He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.
C: DAVE
D: Scientists call this condition "Lust Induced Brain Freeze." It affects millions of guys, every day, in all walks of life -- causing anything from a mild embarrassment, to an international incident. He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS pointing GUNS at him.
C: LEOPOLD
D: Hand over the dog.
C: DAVE
D: Hey. I didn't even know it was a dog. They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.
C: DAVE
D: Notice I didn't say it's a condition that affects men every day -- only guys. And that subtle but important difference is one of the things this movie is about.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: A HUSBAND and his WIFE. He has suitcases by the front door.
C: WIFE
D: You'll never get away with this. I'll sue you down to your last penny.
C: HUSBAND
D: Good luck - I transferred everything we own into private accounts, where you can't touch it. In fact, as of now, you're broke.
C: WIFE
D: But...why?
C: HUSBAND
D: I've fallen in love with another woman. A younger woman. Prettier, with no cellulite. Actually, I think you'd like her.
C: WIFE
D: You bastard. The IMAGE FREEZES. Dave walks into the room.
C: DAVE
D: Now clearly, this woman is dealing with a Man.
N: (MORE)
C: DAVE
D: Whereas Guys aren't capable of doing anything like what you just saw. Guys are more like this:
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. A BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A DIFFERENT HUSBAND sits across from his WIFE. Above and behind her is a TV with SportsCenter on.
C: WIFE
D: I just want you to know, I've thought about this a lot.
C: GUY HUSBAND
D: Mm.
C: WIFE
D: And I've talked it over with everyone I know.
N: GUY HUSBAND (NODS) Good. She looks down; stirs her soda.
C: WIFE
D: So there's nothing left to do now, but leave you, forever, and only see you from across a shiny conference table with bloodthirsty lawyers all around it.
C: GUY HUSBAND
D: -- Okay.
E: a beat; turns to her
C: WIFE
D: "Okay?" That's all you have to say? Well then I guess this is it. She pushes back from the table, starts off.
E: then watching him
C: GUY HUSBAND
D: Wait a minute.
N: (THEN) This can't be happening... The words she's waited for. She turns, relieved.
C: GUY HUSBAND
D: How can you dQ that? How can you trade Lupenza? What's the matter with these people?
E: to the tv then to the BARTENDER
C: BARTENDER
D: Beats me. I saw this on the eight o'clock.
C: GUY HUSBAND
D: He's the backbone of the whole team! They're pikers without Lupenza!
C: WIFE
D: I'll see you in court.
C: GUY HUSBAND
D: -- I gotta call Lenny. He takes out his cell phone. She levels a look.
C: WIFE
D: Maybe you should call your lawyer too.
C: GUY HUSBAND
D: If he could hit left-handed pitching, I would.
N: (THEN) Lenny. Pick up -- the Yankees got Lupenza! The IMAGE FREEZES.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. A FRONT PORCH - DAY
N: Two OLD PEOPLE on a glider. LENORE talks directly to CAMERA. ALBERT'S absorbed with some device that we can't see.
C: LENORE
D: Well when I met him, I didn't know so much. About guys, or men or what have you -- we just didn't talk about such things then. In fact, I didn't see him naked until quite well into our marriage. When was it Albert?
C: ALBERT
D: A year ago. By accident.
C: LENORE
D: Anyway. I thought I was marrying a man, but didn't know that in his heart, he was a guy.
C: DAVE
D: When did you first suspect?
E: O.S.
C: LENORE
D: Not long after the wedding. But it didn't bother me. I just didn't know how to recognize the signs. But we've learned to live with it. Haven't we, Albert? Albert.
E: then after a beat
C: ALBERT
D: It's twelve hundred and thirty-one miles from this spot right here, to Cleveland.
C: LENORE
D: What does that have to do with anything? He holds up the device - handheld GPS.
C: ALBERT
D: Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta.
C: LENORE
D: Who cares how far we are from Atlanta?
C: ALBERT
D: You have a cousin there.
C: LENORE
D: Albert. There's a person here asking us questions. There's a film crew here. He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there. Then holding up the GPS --
C: ALBERT
D: You. Where do you live.
C: DAVE
D: Here in Miami.
E: O.S.
C: ALBERT
D: What part. Lenore buries her head.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY
N: Dave walks down a crowded street. Colorful day life.
C: DAVE
D: Like a lot of big cities, Miami is known for its sizeable population of guys. So we came here to take the city's pulse on the subject.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. A SECRETARY'S OFFICE CUBICLE - DAY
N: A young, pretty, single SECRETARY.
C: SECRETARY
D: Let me put it this way. Everyone I ever dated was a male. I mean they were all men. But only some of them were guys. You know?
C: DAVE
D: I see.
E: O.S.
C: SECRETARY
D: -- The guys were funnier. But the men were more responsible. You could almost half-believe them when they told you something sometimes.
E: thinks about it
C: DAVE
D: So, if you were to meet someone that was funny and responsible...
E: O.S.
C: SECRETARY
D: That would be a woman.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. EQUESTRIAN ESTATE - STABLES - DAY
N: A 20-ish HORSE GROOMER talks to the CAMERA while she combs out a mane.
C: HORSE GROOMER
D: Well guys, they're sort of like your older brother. And men are like your dad.
C: DAVE
D: In what way?
E: O.S.
C: HORSE GROOMER
D: Your older brother doesn't have to grow up. Your dad came that way.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BARN - DAY
N: Dave walks out of the barn towards CAMERA.
C: DAVE
D: So now you have some background on basic guy attributes. But before we move on, let's look at one more scene and see where you stand --
T: CUT TO:
N: TITLE CARD: "ROGER AND ELAINE"
S: INT. ELAINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: ELAINE works at a window desk. ROGER watches NFL on FOX. JOHN MADDEN (ON TV) -- now that's the kind of middle linebacker you like to see. He's got the mud all over him, he's got the bleeding knuckles, he's got the clumps of grass all jammed in his HELMET --
C: ELAINE
D: Roger?
C: ROGER
D: Oh man you gotta show that again Shepauses; chews her pen...
E: to the tv
C: ELAINE
D: Roger...I think I really love you.
N: (MORE)
C: ELAINE
D: But I can't bear the uncertainty anymore, of where this relationship is going. Roger turns...
E: CONT'D looks over there
C: ELAINE
D: I'm not asking whether you want to get married. Only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together. That you, and I - have a future.
C: JOHN MADDEN
D: Now this is just what you want in a playoff game. You got snow, you got mud, you got a lead that keeps changing, you got two great teams that just hate each other to the bone and would rather die than give up... Roger looks...then takes the REMOTE and TURNS OFF THE TV - waving Elaine over, who cuddles into him.
C: ROGER
D: I've been thinking too, Elaine. And for the first time in my life, I'm feeling like I might really be close to a lasting commitment. I haven't said anything up until now because it's always been important to me that I not mislead you. But yes, Elaine. I want to think that we dQ have a future. And with a little more time, I think I could be sure.
C: ELAINE
D: Oh, Roger... He smiles. Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer. They share a long deep sigh together, As the PICTURE FREEZES and DAVE WALKS IN.
C: DAVE
D: If this was how you responded, you're not a guy. You may not even exist. On the other hand...
E: then taking the remote
N: ROGER AND ELAINE DIGITALLY REWIND BACK TO THEIR EARLIER POSITIONS. DAVE RESTARTS THE ACTION AS ELAINE IS SAYING --
C: ELAINE
D: I'm not asking whether you want to get married. Only whether you believe that we have some kind of a future together. That you, and I - have a future. Roger?
E: then looking at him
C: ROGER
D: What. FREEZE on her look, and --
E: engrossed in game
N: DAVE (TO CAMERA) If that was you...you're a guy.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. A DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
N: SHERYL CROW talks to the CAMERA before going onstage. The muffled SOUNDS of the warmup band O.S.
C: SHERYL CROW
D: Well there were always guys at my shows - right from the beginning. I mean you start out playing beer halls, right? So when you have beer, you have guys. And it sorta just grew from there. But I was okay with it. They didn't cause much trouble.
C: DAVE
D: And what about men.
E: O.S.
C: SHERYL CROW
D: Men cause trouble.
N: (THEN) But that's okay too. I get half my songs from that.
C: DAVE
D: So it all works out.
E: O.S.
C: SHERYL CROW
D: Long as they buy the records...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MIAMI PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
N: Dave walks along the stacks in the ANTHROPOLOGY SECTION.
C: DAVE
D: So where did this all start? Many experts now think they know where men came from, but what about Guys? where did they come from? He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things.
C: DAVE
D: To answer this question accurately, we might have to look something up. So instead we'll travel back to prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and get there just in time for the Dawn of Guys.
T: CUT TO:
N: TITLE CARD: "THE DAWN OF GUYS"
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PREHISTORIC AFRICA - MOONLIGHT
N: The endless expanse. A cluster of caves. SOUND EFX of all kinds of nasty shit out there. Skittering over rocks. Slithering through the grasses. Bigger predators, circling... A ROOSTER cocks his head back and CROWS out.
T: CUT TO:
N: TNT. ONE OF THE CAVES PRIMATE ROGER opens one eye...SEES PRIMATE ELAINE, PRIMATE KIDS and PRIMATE IN-LAWS. Hairy grunting things, all sleeping in a protective clump... He rolls over, back to sleep. But the ROOSTER CROWS again...
T: CUT TO:
N: THE ROOSTER, COOKING ON AN OPEN FIRE
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE CAVES - MORNING
N: PRIMATE ROGER comes out. A sleepy nod at PRIMATE GENE and OTHER PRIMATES, as they take up LARGE JAGGED ROCK SLABS leaning against their caves and start off. In a few million years they'll be leaving suburban driveways this way.
S: EXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE AREA - CAVES IN B.G. - MORNING
N: PRIMATE ROGER and PRIMATE GENE have joined PRIMATE LENNY and PRIMATE PHIL. All carrying their slabs of jagged rocks.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Grunt grunt grunt grunt grunt!
N: (SUBTITLE) -- and that's why wildebeests are so mean.
C: PRIMATE GENE
D: Grunt grunt!0 Ha ha!
C: PRIMATE LENNY
D: Grunt grunt grunt! 0 That's really funny!
C: PRIMATE PHIL
D: Grunt ...0 I don't get it... The other three look at him.
S: EXT. THE CAVE AREA - DAY
N: PRIMATE WOMEN work in stooped-over positions, trying to pound roots and tend fires while BABY PRIMATES crawl all over them. They HEAR the Primate Guys' laughter trailing off. They trade looks; Something seems to pass between them...
S: EXT. HUNTING GROUNDS - DAY
N: Primates Roger, Gene, Lenny and Phil get to the grounds and SEE PRIMATES PETE and LOUIE already there. These two don't have the rock slabs though.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Grunt grunt?0 Whassup?
C: PRIMATE PETE
D: Grunt grunt grunt. 0 Nothing. We've been hunting.
C: PRIMATE GENE
D: Grunt grunt? 0 Where are your jagged rock slabs?
C: PRIMATE LOUIE
D: Grunt? â Slabs? (looks at Primate
C: PETE)
D: Grunt grunt grunt? â Who needs slabs? Primate Pete laughs with him; then holds up a ROUND ROCK, about the size of a grapefruit. Primate Roger and Primate Gene trade looks with Primate Lenny and Primate Phil. Grunting/subtitles continue.
C: FIRST FOUR PRIMATES
D: Ooooohhhh. Ooooohhhh.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Where'd you get that?
C: PRIMATE PETE
D: Primate Discount Manny. He just got them in.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Mind if I have a look?
C: PRIMATE PETE
D: Be my guest. He hands it over. Primate Roger lays down his jagged rock slab to check it out. His buddies gather round.
C: PRIMATE GENE
D: How do you kill an animal with that?
C: PRIMATE LOUIE
D: You throw it.
C: PRIMATE LENNY
D: You mean you don't chase the old ones until they get tired and then hit them with the jagged rock slabs?
C: PRIMATE PETE
D: You can stand in one place all day. And when they go by, you just let loose. He shows a throwing motion. The first four look intrigued.
E: shakes his head
C: PRIMATE LOUIE
D: You can carry more than one - and if you're throwing uphill, it rolls back down if you miss. It's so much easier with these.
C: PRIMATE GENE
D: -- I'm sticking with mine. We've been using these jagged slabs forever. And you know why? Because they work. And anyway, killing them is only half of it -- how are you gonna skin a wildebeest with that? They look at Primate Pete: Yeah, how? But he's there.
E: then off their looks
C: PRIMATE PETE
D: We get the women to do it. They look among themselves. They like it. But then.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: How?
C: PRIMATE PETE
D: -- I'm working on it.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE CAVE AREA - SUNSET
N: The PRIMATE WOMEN are still, pounding roots and tending fires and dealing with climbing PRIMATE KIDS. They HEAR SHOUTS O.S.; gather and go to the ridge where they SEE POV FROM RIDGE -- The PRIMATE GUYS are coming back, without their jagged slabs and without any animals. But they are having great fun: running in primitive patterns, and throwing one of the ROCKS back and forth and chasing whoever has it. It looks like the beginnings of rugby, or Australian Rules Football, in terms of all they need now is beer. The PRIMATE WOMEN watch. And trade looks. Once more, something seems to pass between them...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRIMATE CAVE - NIGHT
N: Primate Roger and Primate Elaine try to keep it down for the Primate Kids' sake.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: Please don't tell me you got rid of your jagged rock slab.
E: grunting, subtitled
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: But these are great!
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: But you didn't kill anything.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Nobody's going with jagged slabs anymore.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: But the kids are hungry.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: What about your pounded roots?
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: Pounded roots are a side dish. They need balance in their diets. And another thing - suppose you do start bringing animals home using this -- who's going to skin and clean them? He looks at her-the SOUND of TOMORROW'S ROOSTER CROWING as
E: then off his look
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE CAVE - MORNING
N: Primate Roger comes out of the cave, with his rock. He gives it such a look. Then looking up at the sky he hurls it, up as high as he can... AND THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE ROCK, UP, UP, IN SLOW MOTION, PEAKING, THEN STARTING ITS DESCENT BACK TO EARTH -- ONLY NOW IT'S NOT A ROCK BUT A WINDOWS --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: -- which ROGER is holding, across from ELAINE on the couch.
C: ELAINE
D: Five hundred dollars?
C: ROGER
D: It can hold a thousand addresses.
C: ELAINE
D: So can my address book.
C: ROGER
D: Can your address book pick up your em-ail?
C: ELAINE
D: No but my computer can.
C: ROGER
D: Well this can do both.
C: ELAINE
D: For five hundred dollars it should give me a manicure, Roger! It should drive me home from work at night! HOW could you spend that kind of money without discussing it first? On Roger's look...the PICTURE FREEZES. Dave walks in.
C: DAVE
D: There's a whole list of things a guy is supposed to discuss first. Unfortunately, he never knows what they are until he's already not discussed them.
N: (MORE)
C: DAVE
D: To a girl it's a pain in the butt. But to a guy - some things just come naturally...
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE PROW OF A SHIP - DAY
N: Shrouded in fog. EXPLORER ROGER scans the horizon through a spyglass. Next to him is long-suffering EXPLORER ELAINE.
C: EXPLORER ELAINE
D: Well did you ask?
C: EXPLORER ROGER
D: This is a shortcut. Explorer Elaine shakes her head. Dave enters.
C: DAVE
D: There's a very simple reason why guys don't ask for directions. It's because they know that if they do, someone else - most likely Visigoths - will come and steal their woman. CAMERA PANS to the side rails, where a CLUSTER OF HUNGRY VISIGOTHS nod, slobbering, confirming this.
C: EXPLORER ELAINE
D: I just want to get to Colonial America.
T: CUT TO:
N: TITLE CARD: "GUYS IN COLONIAL AMERICA"
S: EXT. BOSTON HARBOR - NIGHT
N: A bunch of GUYS dressed as Indians are throwing barrels into the water. A COLONIAL REPORTER interviews COLONIAL ROGER.
C: COLONIAL REPORTER
D: -- and this is your way of expressing the public outrage over the high- handed anti-democratic actions of the British Government in general and King George III in specific?
C: COLONIAL ROGER
D: Uh, yeah.
E: looks a little nervous
C: COLONIAL REPORTER
D: Might I ask, sir, whose idea was this?
N: COLONIAL ROGER (POINTS) Guy over there.
C: COLONIAL REPORTER
D: The one drinking coffee?
C: COLONIAL ROGER
D: That's him. His name's Starbuck. He said to get rid of all the tea.
N: COLONIAL REPORTER (NODS; THEN) I see. One more question. Aren't those Greek fraternity letters painted on your chest? The Guy looks; GREEK LETTERS in greasepaint.
C: COLONIAL ROGER
D: I didn't do that. (then as the Reporter
C: WAITS)
D: Don't tell anyone.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MIAMI - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY
N: FOUR MIAMI GIRLS, ethnically cross-sectioned. LILA. MIA. SIDRA. KARLA E.
C: LILA
D: Well that's pretty much how it is right now, right? They don't grow up. Or, they grow up, but they don't change.
N: MIA (NODS) You want to know how to spot a guy, there's your first clue: Look for an otherwise man who did not grow up.
C: SIDRA
D: No they grow up all right -- but only just enough - you know?
N: (MORE)
C: SIDRA
D: Like they'll meet the absolute minimum requirements of being a man, but that's it. The rest of the time they're fourth-graders. Walking fourth-graders.
E: CONT'D
C: KARLA E
D: More like driving fourth graders.
C: SIDRA
D: With credit cards.
C: LILA
D: And a phone.
C: MIA
D: And give them ten minutes on their own? Or put them in with other guys? Now you've gone nuclear.
C: KARLA E
D: Please.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BURGER KING - DAY
N: The lot is filled with 60's and 70's cars. Dave gets out of a CHEVY VEGA; has mutton-chop sideburns, talks to CAMERA.
C: DAVE
D: In learning to understand Guys today, it's important to remember that these same guys, only yesterday, were just kids.
T: CUT TO :
S: INT. BURGER KING - DAY
N: A table of 8 YEAR OLD BOYS: punching, eating, climbing all over each other. One poor luckless DAD with them.
C: BURGER KING DAD
D: Stop punching!
C: BURGER KING KID
D: We're not punching!
C: BURGER KING DAD
D: You are too punching - now stop! We didn't come here to punch!
N: They stop; look at him as if he's crazy. Then one of them notices ROGER AT 8 looking O.S.
C: BURGER KING KID
D: Hey Roger's got a girlfriend.
N: ROGER AT 8 I do not!
C: BURGER KING KID
D: Then what're you looking at!
N: ROGER AT 8 Nothing! And they start punching again. The Dad looks up - so weary... DAVE (AT COUNTER) Here we can see where even at an early age, guy behavior is already well developed along complex patterns that social scientists have called, "jerks." While girls at the same age are referred to by the same social scientists, as "human beings." ANGLE ON A TABLE FULL OF GIRLS - INCLUDING ELAINE AT AGE 8 They are all chatting nicely, passing out napkins and ketchup packets making sure everyone has what they need. While the MOTHER that brought them quietly reads a novel.
C: DAVE
D: See? Humans. He walks past with his takeout order. As ELAINE at 8 notices Roger, blushing, taking all this punishment because of her.
C: BURGER KING DAD
D: Will you please stop punching!
E: as Dave exits
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NOTED PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Dave sits across from a BRITISH GUY with a SUBTITLE saying, "Noted Pediatrician. " He has a laser pointer and a powerpoint presentation.
C: DAVE
D: Where are we in the area of Guy Violence, Doctor.
C: SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
D: Well first, one must understand the inherent differences in DNA and cell structure as relates to men and women.
N: (CLICKING SLIDES) For example, all women have a gene that makes them have the need for meaningful conversations. Likewise, all men have a gene in them that we scientists believe is directly related to violence.
C: DAVE
D: And what can be done about that.
C: SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
D: well, some of my esteemed colleagues are quite keen on the idea of tampering with the DNA itself - an idea with which I heartily disagree. The bastards...
C: DAVE
D: Then what would you recommend.
C: SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
D: Me? Well they can start by spreading out the funding a little bit. Let a few other scientists wet their beaks. I mean what's the point of rewarding the same tired old hacks, year after
N: YEAR --
C: DAVE
D: I meant about Guy Violence.
N: SCIENTIFIC EXPERT OH -- (then shifting back) Well nothing, really. I mean, what can you do. Short of lobotomizing them, anyway. No I suppose we'll just have to continue to channel their aggression into socially acceptable outlets. Like professional wrestling, or the space program.
C: DAVE
D: I see. Can I ask you a question?
C: SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
D: Certainly.
C: DAVE
D: Where'd you get that laser pointer.
C: SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
D: It's mine.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TOY WORLD WAREHOUSE PLANET - DAY
N: Dave stands in front of the entrance.
C: DAVE
D: A lot of work has been done in the field of children's toys and how they unconsciously reinforce gender roles. Studies have found that over ninety-three per cent of this work is done by researchers who don't have children of their own. But to test the theory anyway, we're here at Toy World Warehouse Planet.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TOY WORLD WAREHOUSE PLANET - DAY
N: Dave shepherds new father GENE up to the CUSTOMER HELP counter.
C: DAVE
D: Hi! My friend here is looking for toys for his son that are gender neutral, environmentally sound, and culturally unbiased!
C: SALES GUY
D: Here it is. He brings up a box with a picture of a spinning top on it.
C: NEW FATHER GENE
D: What's it do?
C: SALES GUY
D: It's recyclable.
C: NEW FATHER GENE
D: Where are the trucks and guns.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TOY WORLD PARKING LOT - DAY
N: New Father Gene meets up with NEW MOTHER KELLY at the car. She came from GROCERY WORLD; he helps load up the bags...
C: NEW MOTHER KELLY
D: What's this?
C: NEW FATHER GENE
D: (looks, sees the toy
C: STORE BOX)
D: Oh I got that for Benjy.
C: NEW MOTHER KELLY
D: You were supposed to get a rattle.
C: NEW FATHER GENE
D: All the rattles were recalled.
C: NEW MOTHER KELLY
D: So you bought a tank.
C: NEW FATHER GENE
D: Wait'll you see what this can do, baby. Benjy's gonna love it.
C: NEW MOTHER KELLY
D: Oh yeah? Can he shake it? Will it rattle?
C: NEW FATHER GENE
D: Rattle? This thing'll bring down a bookshelf! She looks at him. He'll be returning the thing within seconds. CAMERA PANS to Dave, who shrugs.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DETROIT - ED'S AUTO SHOP - DAY
N: A rundown place with junked cars out front. ED's an intense little guy in a Tigers' hat and a couple major tattoos.
C: ED
D: Well I'm into fireworks. I like to take 'em apart, you know. And study 'em. See what makes 'em tick.
N: He shows Dave a box with ASSORTED FIREWORKS inside.
C: ED
D: I just got these from Ohio. I don't think they're as good as the ones I got from Tennessee. Not as loud, you know?
C: DAVE
D: Well no, if loud is your --
C: ED
D: If you want to hear loud - listen to this. He goes over to a different box, takes out what looks like a stick of dynamite. Gets ready to light it; turns to CAMERA.
C: ED
D: You may want to step back a couple hundred yards.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DAVE'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY
N: As Ed's Auto Shop recedes in the background - with a LOUD EXPLOSION accompanying -
C: DAVE
D: So when we see guys like Ed, and his fireworks - or guys shooting marine flares into innocent pumpkins, or building catapults that'll throw a Buick - we should not condemn them.

Then a while later, some guy calls you up with the same exact joke. Then when group faxing came in, it really sped things up.

The topical ones, your mass murders and tragic accidents and the like, they're naturally gonna have a lot more heat on them and they'll circulate a lot quicker. I mean no one's gonna sit on a Princess Diana joke until three weeks after the crash. No one i know, anyway.

Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going this way. I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?

N: Elaine and Roger are inside, looking at the front door.
C: ELAINE
D: What do you mean, it's 'supposed to be that way.' It's stuck.
C: ROGER
D: It's basic physics, Elaine. Wood expands. And then, later, it contracts.
C: ELAINE
D: But we can't get out.
C: ROGER
D: Which also means other people can't get in. That's part of the design - it discourages burglars.
C: ELAINE
D: The same way the toaster was designed to discourage carbohydrate consumption by bursting into flames?
E: looks at him
C: ROGER
D: That was an outdoor toaster. It was clearly not designed for indoor situations. The PICTURE FREEZES. DAVE steps in front, talks to CAMERA.
C: DAVE
D: I think it's obvious here, that Roger has absolutely no idea what he's talking about. But Guy Pride forces him to keep acting like he does know, for reasons I believe we've covered in an earlier scene. He nods his head over to the corner, where the CAMERA PANS TO SEE HUDDLED VISIGOTHS, WAITING. Then BACK TO ROGER AND ELAINE as the PICTURE UNFREEZES.
C: ELAINE
D: Okay. So now we have a broken water heater and a stuck front door.

WOMEN look out from kitchen and bedroom and living room windows, from front steps and yards and gardens, just to see whose house Steve is leaving. The women look all dreamy the way they would in a really corny musical.

N: INTERCUT WITH ROGER IN THE BASEMENT He's in ankle deep water. Pokes a FLASHLIGHT into some of the corners where the overhead bulb doesn't reach.
C: ROGER
D: Good news, honey! The basement's level.
C: ELAINE
D: How can you tell?
C: ROGER
D: Because I know a well built floor when I see one! We were right to buy this house. Everything works just the way it should!
C: ELAINE
D: Except there's no hot water.
C: ROGER
D: Sweetheart, don't you remember? The power company talked about this.
E: aiming the flashlight
C: ELAINE
D: How about calling Steve.
N: ROGER (HATES THIS) We'll call "Steve," when we have a real problem. Okay? (then more to himself) A mouse gets the hiccups, you don't have to call Steve every time.
C: ELAINE
D: But Roger you're such a good copy editor. You don't have to be a good repairman too! Honest!
E: hears him whang something down there

D: I don't know why he does this. He doesn't know what he's doing down there...
C: KELLY
D: It'll be all right.
C: ELAINE
D: It's not like some broken part is just going to be standing there, waving a flag that says "Help me." Or there'll be an octopus on the compressor, and then he could say, "Look! There's an octopus on the compressor!"
E: off a loud CLANG
N: (THEN) Of course, how would he know it was the compressor...
C: KELLY
D: Trust me, it'll all work out. After a while, there's no more harm they can do. Roger comes around from the side door. SLOSHING feet. Holds a dripping PART.
C: ROGER
D: I just need to go to the hardware store. Hi Kelly. Kelly smiles, waves. Then as Roger sloshes past, to the car.
C: ELAINE
D: And what is it about the hardware store? All they do in there is buy a bunch of tools that they don't know how to use -- and no matter what the problem is, all they'll end up doing is whacking at it with a hammer until it breaks even more.
C: KELLY
D: And then they cover it all up with duct tape and then come out and say it's supposed to work that way.

Get her one of these old semi-retired guys - someone from the pre-steroid days, with the hairy shoulders, and the butt crack. They won't be so quick to call him every ten minutes. The Clerk comes back. Hands over a 53-piece TOOL SET.

N: (POINTS) You got calcification in your pullet- beam header grommets.

D: I was afraid of that. Steve looks at him. One of those sideways looks.
C: STEVE
D: What you gotta do is jack up your laminate bolts and remove the calcification on the stress points.
C: ROGER
D: (while Steve takes
C: SOME MEASUREMENTS)
D: Of course when he says "you," he doesn't mean "me." I don't have jacks. I don't have winches. And Steve has got like fifty kinds of each, right on his truck. If society collapsed, the Steves of the world will be living in nice sturdy shelters that they built with their own hands, eating food that they grew or caught. And I'll be getting shredded to death by wolverines.

I grant you the Yankees seem to have this, this knack for making brilliant deals year after year. But three months? The Marlins are over it. The Yankees are over it. The players and their families are over it -- but just check this out.
E: pops in a tape
N: CALLER (ON TAPE) The guy was a workhorse! He filled in wherever he was needed and he never got hurt! And when he got hurt, he played hurt. MIKE THE MOOSE (ON TAPE) You know I got a post card from him here at the station. He says they're all doing fine: Lucita's got the kids in their new school already and they all seem happy. She even found an Ecuadorean grocery she likes.

D: Grocery -- the guy batted 340, from both sides.
N: (MORE)

C: KELLY
D: Not during the playoffs anyway.
C: ELAINE
D: And what gets me is, they think - they really think - that whether a team wins or loses or not depends on how much they personally care about them. Like if they don't care, the team can't win.
E: amen to that; then

D: But that's true. They look over - see him on the counter.
C: ELAINE

D: John, you heard what our leading expert said about this particular anxiety that guys have regarding bathrooms in general and public ones in particular. Any thoughts?
C: JOHN MADDEN
D: Well he's exactly right, Dave. I mean the guy was a little loopy but he hit the nail on the head.
C: DAVE
D: So an airport bathroom presents a specific kind of challenge.
C: JOHN MADDEN
D: The worst kind, Dave, and in a lotta ways. Because a guy's main goal is to get in and outta there without having to deal in any other way with any other guy - and in an airport bathroom especially, with the turnover rate they've got, he's up against some pretty mean odds.

He's got one flank covered this way and for now he's feelin' pretty good -- and of course by doin' that, he's also settin' the tone for everything that happens after.
N: râ¢ . 68.
C: DAVE
D: What's the main thing we're looking for, John. What does each individual guy feel he needs to get out of this.
C: JOHN MADDEN
D: Well the crucial thing here, is makin' sure there's no eye contact. I mean none - zero. These guys'll look up, they'll look down, they'll look straight ahead -- but a guy would rather have you poke both his eyes out with burning hot fire tongs, Dave, than to give the next guy over a reason to think you might be lookin' at him in a public bathroom. For reasons that oughtta be pretty darn obvious.
C: DAVE
D: Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy Number Two -- The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.
C: JOHN MADDEN
D: Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna do is, he's gonna come in, see the first guy in position along the wall and right away he's gonna line up wide on the opposite side. This is a best case scenario here, something both these guys can appreciate. Plus they've opened up the middle for the third guy -- The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle urinal. The Guy goes there.
C: DAVE
D: What about eye contact in this situation.
C: JOHN MADDEN
D: Well you're still not likely to encounter any, but again if you do, that's what that buffer zone on either side of him's for. And all three of 'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have it, I can tell you that.
C: DAVE
D: Okay. Now if things stay like this...
C: JOHN MADDEN
D: If things stay like this, you're fine - and if this were some small commuter airport, y'know late at night or somethin', then these guys could possibly even be home free. But we're talkin' Miami International here, this is the big time, we're talking about 747's, DC-10's, the big jumbo jets dumpin' off three- four hundred people at a clip. So everybody's gonna be next to somebody, which is the last thing any of these guys want. You're in a critical mass situation, and this is where a lotta mistakes get made.

But something comes, and it hits every guy who's living whether he likes it or not. Whether he knows it or not. Guy can lose his bleepin' mind if he doesn't watch out. He gets a mirror to show Dave the back. Gives him time to get philosophical.

D: You want to go hang gliding?
C: LAWYER
D: I want to teach hang gliding.
C: SECRETARY
D: I'm sorry. I didn't know you did that.
C: LAWYER
D: I don't do that. I want to do that. I've always wanted to do that, and lots of other things too -- only I'm stuck doing this all day long. And I don't even know what this is half the time, just that I have to spend every waking hour doing it. So you tell me -- where the hell does hang gliding fit into that.
C: SECRETARY
D: Um. Saturdays?
C: LAWYER
D: Give me a break.
C: SECRETARY
D: Where are you going?
E: as he starts to leave
C: LAWYER
D: I should have done this a long time ago.
C: SECRETARY
D: What about the letter?

S: EXT. JOHNNY LAKE'S HANG GLIDING CENTER - DAY
N: JOHNNY LAKE lifts a titanium frame up onto the back of a pickup. Part of it catches on the lift gate and he SWEARS, kicking it. About to really lay into it when the LAWYER drives up in his twin turbo convertible and gets out.
C: LAWYER
D: Hi!
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: Sorry. We're closed.
C: LAWYER
D: -- It's two thirty in the afternoon.
E: stunned; watches him
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: Hey. I don't make the rules.
C: LAWYER
D: Aren't you the owner?
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: You're right. I do make the rules. We're closed.
C: LAWYER
D: Look, there has to -- I really want to learn this -- I just quit my job to learn this.
E: sees he means it
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: Be my guest - learn it. He kicks the frame again, walks off. The Lawyer watches.
C: LAWYER
D: How can you do this? This is the perfect job!
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: Yeah right. Driving around in a rusted worthless pickup truck that's about to be repossessed anyway, while a guy like you, my own age, is going around in a Porsche Carrera.
C: LAWYER
D: But you get to fly.
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: No, you get to fly. I get to hoof this shit up and down these godforsaken hilltops listening to stockbrokers brag about getting lap dances from college coeds, and charging the whole thing through the company expense account -- while I can't even deduct my blood pressure medication. That's what I get to do. He kicks a rock in the road, which almost feels good enough so he kicks another one -- but this one is buried in the dirt like an iceberg and doesn't budge --
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: Ahh, SHIT! -- and he falls down hobbling on one knee instead.

C: LAWYER
D: Look at this.
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: You got that right. The Lawyer shakes his head; flips the page.
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: Hey. You don't think he's gonna...
E: then on Lawyer's look; he shrugs
C: LAWYER
D: What.
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: You know. Have to use the --
C: LAWYER
D: Glove? You hurt your knee. He already took the x-rays.
E: then off his look
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: What if something's broken.
C: LAWYER
D: Well he's not going in that way. You don't do a rectal to set a guy's leg. Still the guy looks doubtful. The ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON - British, familiar - comes in, with a fresh X-RAY.
C: ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
D: Well you've done quite a number on yourself. Want to see?
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: Why should I. I wouldn't know what the hell I'm looking at. You're the one who went to medical school.
C: ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
D: Don't remind me. What. You think I like this?
E: then on their looks

D: Of courseIam - I'm an orthopedic surgeon!Ijust don't like people assumingit!
N: (THENASHIS BEEPER
C: GOESOFF)
D: And this -- I am so sick of this bloody thing I can't even tell you! Because every time it goes off it means I have to stop doing one thing I don't want to be doing, and start doing another thing I don't want to be doing. You call that a life? They look at him. Don't know what to say.
C: ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
D: -- Let me show you something. I've been working on this during my free time. Not like I get any. He gets an accordion-style envelope; takes out a REAM OF TYPED PAGES. Hands it over to Johnny Lake.
E: puts down the x-ray, goes to a drawer
C: JOHNNY LAKE
D: What is it?
C: ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
D: What is it? It's a screenplay! This'll blow the lid off the orthopedic surgery industry! Look - look here -- (takes it back; flips

Then the BARTENDER FROM BEFORE comes out, storms past them and throws his rag down hard as he gets the hell out of there and away from that shit job. As Dave walks into frame, starts over to his car.

S: INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY
N: Dave walks up the aisles filled with delectable things.
C: DAVE
D: when I say "euphemisms," I of course am not suggesting that guys don't have them. Guys have plenty of euphemisms. Most guys have more euphemisms in a single day - and here I am thinking of a day that occurred in the summer between ninth and tenth grades - than some women have in a lifetime - or longer, in the case of certain Math Teachers.

C: DAVE
D: Today, however, women want euphemisms too -- and this ability in males is no longer as prized as it once was.
N: (MORE)
C: DAVE
D: In fact, when modern women describe the qualities they're looking for in the ideal man, the phrase "a real fast shooter" is usually pretty far down the list.

N: Roger and Elaine are under the sheets. Some good early MOANING.. .as Dave comes in, holding a mike, interview style.
C: DAVE
D: One of the most time honored and reliable mental delaying styles, is the Baseball Method -- -- how's it going, Champ. Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from the neck down.
E: taps Roger's shoulder
C: ROGER
D: Oh - yeah hi.
C: (ACKNOWLEDGES CAMERA;
D: then to Dave) Well, the baseball thing. I mean a while ago I was into that - big time. You know, fooling around with different lineups, mixing up the batting order - like thinking about what would happen if you took your cleanup guy and made him eighth or something -- just something stupid like that, you know? Stuff you'd never really do.
C: DAVE
D: And that did the trick.
C: ROGER
D: Oh hell yeah. I mean I could go all night - literally all night - just shuffling my pitching staff around, or thinking about who I might try and sign at the winter meetings. Hang on -- He goes under the blanket; pays more attention to Elaine... then comes back.
C: ROGER
D: The thing is, it got stale. And I found after a while I wasn't enjoying sex or baseball that much. And you don't want to mess with that stuff.
N: DAVE (CAN'T DISAGREE) So what do you do instead?
C: ROGER
D: Math problems.
C: DAVE
D: Really? You mean like if a train leaves Chicago at one o'clock and another train leaves Denver at two o'clock and they're going at different speeds?
E: off his nod
C: ROGER
D: I can't do train ones. I always end up imagining this beautiful girl on the train - and it makes things even worse. Elaine stops. Pops her head out.
E: shakes his head
C: ELAINE
D: what beautiful girl.
C: ROGER
D: -- You, Elaine. The girl on the train is always you.

N: Dave helps himself, makes a sandwich.
C: DAVE
D: As you can see, a lot of guys are making a tremendous effort here - and yet, according to certain standards they are still, basically, lame as hell on almost every single count. The reason for this is simple: women set the standards. And not just bedroom standards -- all standards. Because women invented standards. Remember the Dawn of Guys?

N: Primate Elaine addresses the OTHERS. All SUBTITLES.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: I've been thinking. We need some standards around here.
C: PRIMATE KELLY
D: What are standards?
C: PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN
D: What is 'thinking?' The others turn, look at her. Look back at Primate Blaine.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: Standards are like rules. Things they'll have to do. And things they'll have to stop doing.
C: PRIMATE KELLY
D: How about "no leaving your dirty smelly loincloths wherever you feel like it, and expecting me to do something about it?" Can that be a standard?
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: That can be one of the first.
C: PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN
D: How about "No gnawing on a fish head during sex?"
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: There are all kinds of things we can get them to do.
C: PRIMATE LUCY
D: How? They're stronger than we are.
C: PRIMATE KELLY
D: They smell stronger maybe.
C: PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN
D: I like the smell.
E: off their laughter
C: PRIMATE LUCY
D: Of the men, or the rotten fish?
C: PRIMATE KELLY
D: There's a difference? More laughing; then they turn back to Primate Elaine.
C: PRIMATE KELLY
D: But how will we make them go along? Most of them can't even remember which cave to come home to every night. How are they going to remember rules?
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: We'll give them a Look.
C: PRIMATE LUCY
D: A look?
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: A special look. A 'Certain Look.'
C: PRIMATE KELLY
D: But we look at them every day. And they still do whatever they want.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: I've been working on this. Watch. She turns to Primate Blonde Woman, who is holding a gourd. On the Look, the Blonde drops the gourd.
E: as the others agree

D: What are you doing later.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: I don't know. Probably just stare at the fire.
C: PRIMATE GENE
D: A bunch of us are going over to Primate Blonde Woman's cave to see what she does with those gourds. Want to come?
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: -- Can't. Primate Elaine's ancestors are still here.

C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: This one's better. It's an upgrade.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
D: What did he say it was called?
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: An 'upgrade.' An improvement on a previous design.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER
D: What? What'd he say?
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
D: An upgrade. An grade.
E: to his wife
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: The guy said there are newer ones coming out that'll make even this one look primitive. They're getting lighter and rounder every epoch.
E: to Primate Elaine
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
D: What guy.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Primate Discount Manny.
N: PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER (MUTTERS) Boy he must have seen this one coming...
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: Dad. I just wanted to know what the difference is between this one and the one you had. You were so excited about it when you got it, and now you've gotten rid of it -- and the only difference I can see is where this one has these markings painted on. She holds it up; something like BASEBALL SEAMS going around.
E: then to Primate Roger
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Those make it so it travels better.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: Painted on? -- What'd it cost you.
E: off his look
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Nothing. A couple wildebeeste steaks and handful of seeds of some kind.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
D: I told you. Did I say he was a bum?
E: then to his wife
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Who's a bum. Are you calling me a bum?
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER
D: No one's calling anyone a bum.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
D: I'm just visiting. You do what you want.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: Oh yeah? Who do you think killed your dinner tonight?
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: Look. Just take it back. Please.
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: But I can't do that! All sales are final!
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: You can explain it to him. Tell him he can keep the steaks, but we want the seeds back.
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S MOTHER
D: I don't mean to meddle. But you should listen to your wife.
E: to Primate Roger
C: PRIMATE ELAINE'S FATHER
D: That's meddling! That's meddling! -- But in this case she's right.
E: then to Primate Roger
C: PRIMATE ELAINE
D: Look will you both stop? Just take this back. All right?
E: to her parents then to Primate Roger
C: PRIMATE ROGER
D: This is totally unreasonable!
N: (THEN) Oh I get it. Don't tell me -- it's your time in the moon cycle again -- He stops cold. Stunned by her CERTAIN LOOK. History's first in SLOW MOTION, FROM SEVERAL ANGLES, the way they do it when buildings explode in much bigger movies.

S: EXT. MIAMI, BAYSIDE COMPLEX - DAY
N: Dave strolls among the SHOPPERS, TOURISTS etc. He has the ROCK with him; tosses it unconsciously like a baseball.
C: DAVE
D: This is basically where we stand today. The only difference is, we have way more standards. There are social standards, about being sensitive - remembering anniversaries, listening during conversations, not eating soup with your hands, or sitting around in your underwear when company's over.
E: gives the ROCK to a KID passing by
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: Dave goes up the escalator; walks through the kind of 'Home Stylings' section where no other guy would go. Everything he talks about is on display in some form.
C: DAVE
D: -- And there are thousands of standards for domestic life, involving even more totally un-guy concepts -- like curtains, bedspreads, napkins, special hangers, little soaps shaped like fruit, and decorative boxes that hold tissues that already come in a box. While guys, left on their own in the wild, will develop lifestyles that don't involve any of these things.

N: COLLEGE ROGER and COLLEGE GENE stand in their doorway. There is one window, a lot of dust and nothing else.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE SAME APARTMENT - SOME MONTHS LATER
N: A RABBIT on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray. College Roger and College Gene play Indoor Death Hockey; slamming into walls, scattering NEWSPAPERS and PIZZA BOXES - as their IMAGE FREEZES.
C: DAVE
D: of course, even by the most basic standards, these two are living like savages. But they honestly don't know this -- because Guys, in their natural state, aren't any more aware of domestic standards than a trout would be aware of the stock market. And this causes women a lot of concern.

C: SEATTLE GIRL
D: Take laundry. To him his clean clothes are ready when he's ready to go get them. And they can dry the rest of the way in the drawer. But they don't dry the rest of the way in the drawer, they sit there in damp musty unfolded balls and he doesn't even mind, and I can't figure that out. What is the matter with folding something? What is the matter with waiting for it to be dry?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DAVE'S CURRENT BEDROOM - DAY
N: Dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed. Starts folding the clean clothes and making piles.
C: DAVE
D: Laundry's a big issue - and a deep and puzzling mystery to guys. My own wife Michelle, for instance, is an accomplished sportswriter and mother of an extremely young child, yet she is still able to maintain a vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen bordering on the super-human. And I'm not allowed near the stuff.
C: MICHELLE
D: (comes in with more
C: CLOTHES)
D: He's right. She dumps out the clothes, sees what he's doing and takes over, doing it better. Dave picks up a random BLOUSE, shows a LABEL with lots of printing on it.
C: DAVE
D: These are clearly secret codes, that women intuitively understand but cannot adequately explain -- just like how a lot of guys understand the Infield Fly Rule, without being able to explain that.
C: MICHELLE
D: I can explain the Infield Fly Rule.

S: EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY
N: Dave anchors a semi circle with Sidra, Mia, Karla E and Lila. They take turns focus group style.
C: SIDRA
D: Sometimes I think they're just like tapeworms. You know? I mean tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's all they are, and all they'll ever be. They're just these repulsive little parasitic beasts and nobody expects anything different from them - because people know that's their nature. And it's the same way with guys - although a tapeworm's more likely to help clean out the garage.
N: LILA (NODS) They have to be the biggest and they have to be the best. And they can never back down from a challenge. Ever.
C: KARLA E
D: They sleep with your sister and wonder what's wrong with that.
C: MIA
D: They will make a game out of anything. A contest out of anything. Give them a grain of sand and they will figure out some game with it.
C: LILA
D: And they'll argue over the rules.
C: KARLA E
D: They leave their dirty dishes everywhere. I can't believe the places I'll find some crusted over cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of God knows what in them. And the thing is, from his point of view? They really do get cleaned by magic! Because I can't take seeing them sit there, so I clean them.
E: off their agreement
C: SIDRA
D: I just get him to wash my car when that stuff happens.
E: to Karla E
C: KARLA E
D: Sweetheart he could wash my car with his tongue and it still wouldn't make up for where I find those dishes sometimes.
C: DAVE
D: So now that we've heard your thoughts. The frustration, the exasperation... the obvious question comes to mind: Why go through it? Why have guys in your life at all? They look at him.
E: while they commiserate
C: MIA
D: -- You mean as a choice? You mean like a mature adult choice to have a guy in your life? In spite of everything?
C: SIDRA
D: Like trying to borrow money from you, after you've broken up, so he can buy something for his new girlfriend? And wondering what the problem was with that? I mean like really not knowing? Dave looks at her. They all do. Until --
C: LILA
D: I'll tell you why. There is no good reason, that's why. The others turn, look her way.
C: LILA
D: -- I mean don't get me wrong. They really can be fun. You know, like a big stupid dog can be fun. I mean not everything has to be so serious in life. You want to be able to do more with someone than just read book reviews together - which is something a guy would never do anyway. (then as the others
C: LISTEN CLOSER)
D: But what a guy will do? Is at eleven o'clock at night he'll show up at your door and bring cheese steaks. And he doesn't care that you look all rumply and dreadful from not expecting anyone. He might not even remember that you're a vegetarian and don't eat cheese steaks -- but that doesn't really matter either. Because the point is he wanted one, and he can't come out and say it but he didn't want to eat it alone.
C: MIA
D: And you're the person he thought of.
C: LILA
D: I can't tell you what that feels like, when they do that. I swear, if they knew how adorable they are sometimes, they'd be dangerous. I mean -- more dangerous. The other Girls think about that. Considering...
E: off her look; nods a beat; and then
C: SIDRA
D: -- Bullshit. They're tapeworms. The rest of them agree and all high-five her. Dave leans back from the fray, turns to the CAMERA.

D: Well now you know where things stand. You've learned a little bit about guys, and the critical roles they've played in the past and in modern society today. And for better or worse, they're here with us to stay -- so the best thing you can do about it, is continue to learn about them - by coming to see this movie lots and lots of times, and bringing more and more of your friends back every time you do.

C: JOHN MADDEN
D: -- that's how you know it's a real movie, in my book. That's how you know it's not some boring kinda art piece made by these tortured head case kids fresh outta film school -- you're not gonna come outta this theater talkin' about symbolism, or the use of darkness and light or any kinda mumbo-jumbo like that -- you come out of this movie and you're laughin'. And that's what I like in a movie - a movie that's funny but it doesn't take forever, you know? You still got some time to do somethin' after, maybe go get somethin' to eat, y'know?
