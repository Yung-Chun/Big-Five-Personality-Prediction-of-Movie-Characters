S: EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: Heavy leaden skies over the arachnoid stands and floodlights of Elland Road stadium: home to Leeds United football club. And rain. Sheets of angry, Yorkshire rain. TITLE: "THE DAMNED UNITED"
S: INT. BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: Flashlights pop as DON REVIE, (late 40's), the most successful manager in English football, walks out in front of a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS. He is flanked by the Chairman of Leeds United, (MANNY CUSSINS, 60's), and several other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board.
C: REVIE
D: I'm just going to make a brief statement.
N: CAPTION: "JULY 4th, 1974" REVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet, filled with the silverware he has won. REPORTERS wait: intimidated. Cowed. REVIE (cont'd) Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I accepted the FA's offer to become the next manager of the England national football team. A gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved fathers losing their favourite son. REVIE (cont'd) Obviously that involves me leaving Leeds United after 13 happy and successful years, which makes me very sad. I'd like to think I have built the club into a family and there must be sadness when anybody leaves a family. However, when one man goes, another steps into his place. I know who I think that person should be, the man to replace me, and I shall make my feelings clear to the directors. Thank you. No further comments. REVIE turns and walks out, a volley of REPORTERS shouting questions...

N: We're in a car. Tarmac passes beneath us. Roadmarkings. OVER THIS: the sound of a flat Teeside voice, singing along with Frank Sinatra on the radio...
C: VOICE
D: "Fly me to the Moon.."
E: V.O.
S: INT. CAR - DAY - (1974)
N: Two young BOYS, (12, 9) stare out of car windows. Raindrops on the panes of glass. Their father, BRIAN CLOUGH, (39), slick, modern, cocky, handsome. About as big a contrast to DON REVIE as it's possible to find, is up front. Driving..
C: CLOUGH
D: "And let me play among the stars.."
E: singing
C: SIMON
D: When are we there?
C: CLOUGH
D: Any moment now. On the right. "Let me see what spring is like..."
E: singing
N: The car turns a bend, and suddenly the floodlights and stands of a football stadium come into view. The BOYS' eyes widen. BOY 1 There it is! Dad! There it is! The BOYS smile in excitement.
C: CLOUGH
D: "..on Jupiter and Mars.."
E: singing
N: `LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB' written on the side of the stadium. CLOUGH smiles, then puts his foot down. The car accelerates past the turning. The BOYS' smiles fade. BOY 1 Where are you going? Dad? You've missed it.
C: CLOUGH
D: We've something else to do first. Won't take long.
E: singing MO RE CO NTINU ED

S: INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY - (1974)
N: The `CALENDER' front title sequence, a Yorkshire TV current affairs program. We're in a TV studio. The presenter is AUSTIN MITCHELL, (40)..
C: MITCHELL
D: Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts his new job as manager of Leeds United, taking over from Don Revie - the most successful manager in the club's history, under whom Leeds have won everything..
C: CLOUGH
D: ..not QUITE everything. Not won the European Cup...
C: MITCHELL
D: ...but pretty much everything else. Daunted?
C: CLOUGH
D: Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking forward to it.
C: MITCHELL
D: The biggest challenge of your life, and you'll be without Peter Taylor, for the first time. Your lifelong professional colleague.
C: CLOUGH
D: Yes, Pete's at Brighton now. He had the opportunity to come with me, but Brighton was his choice. Leeds was mine.
C: MITCHELL
D: A surprising choice, some might say. Because you've been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years.
C: CLOUGH
D: I have.
N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D:
C: MITCHELL
D: You've accused players of dirty tactics, cheating, dissent, foul play. You called Norman Hunter, Norman "Bites yer legs" Hunter, you've said Peter Lorimer falls when no one touches him...
C: CLOUGH
D: And I was right.
C: MITCHELL
D: I'm curious. Why do you now show such alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for so long?
C: CLOUGH
D: Goodness, it's going to take me half an hour to explain all those words for a start.
N: Laughter from the camera CREW.. CLOUGH (cont'd) Football is a beautiful game, Austin. It needs to be played beautifully. I think Leeds have sold themselves short...
S: 5A INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 5A
N: CLOUGH's interview continues on a TV in a sitting-room, where it is being watched by Don Revie, sitting in an armchair...
C: CLOUGH
D: ..they've been champions but they've not been good champions in the sense of wearing the crown well. They've not been loved. But then that's hardly surprising, given the type of operation there's been in place there.
E: ON TV

S: 5C INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 5C
N: REVIE continues to watch the TV...
C: MITCHELL
D: ..who has long been regarded as a father figure in Leeds. And now you're coming in as the outsider, the enemy even, after all the things you've said in public, coming in and taking ouver as STEPfather.
S: 5D INT. YORKSHIRE TV - SAME TIME 5D
N: MITCHELL looks up at CLOUGH... (CO NTINU ED) 5D CON TINUE D: 5D
C: MITCHELL
D: Don't you expect some degree of resentment to this?
C: CLOUGH
D: I would accept and expect a strangeness, initially, it's perfectly normal. But it won't be long before they realise I'm a fair man. A kind man. And maybe under me they can experience what it's like to be in a happy family, after all.
C: MITCHELL
D: How can you be sure they weren't happy with Don all along?
C: CLOUGH
D: They wouldn't have played football that way if they were happy.
S: 5E INT. REVIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 5E
N: DON REVIE's eyes burn with indignation. He picks up a telephone, and angrily starts to dial..
S: EXT. TRAINING FIELD - DAY - (1974)
N: Here they are. The Leeds PLAYERS. Long hair and long faces. Surly. Truculent. Dangerous. Out on the practice pitch. In the rain. Some doing warm-up exercises. Others milling dangerously in groups. Their names on their purple track suits. HUNTER, LORIMER, GILES, BATES, GRAY, CLARKE, BREMNER, MCQUEEN
S: EXT. CAR PARK - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: CLOUGH's car pulls up. He and his sons get out. A few waiting press. Cameras. Lights. A few FANS with autograph books.

D: Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire weather! I tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to Majorca!
E: gestures shivering
N: CLOUGH laughs. The PLAYERS stare in silence. Squinting in the drizzle. Condensation coming from their mouths. JOHNNY GILES stares. BILLY BREMNER spits and continues talking disrespectfully. CLOUGH (cont'd) Not much of a welcome, was it? And not so much as a smile from Johnny Giles.
C: JIMMY
D: You're five days late!! And did you really need to say that about Majorca? You know he was Revie's first choice for getting your job.
E: beat, changing the subject
C: CLOUGH
D: Who? Johnny Giles?
N: CLOUGH looks over at GILES, who turns away, resumes training.... CLOUGH (cont'd) Was he now? And Bremner?
C: JIMMY
D: Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His first born. You're never going to get any love from him.
N: BREMNER, a flint-eyed Scot, stares at CLOUGH..
C: CLOUGH
D: Great. Here's to happy fucking families.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: JIMMY GORDON leads CLOUGH and his BOYS down a corridor, where countless photographs of DON REVIE hang on the walls. Holding silverware. They pass an open door, with a sign outside, `MANAGER. Mr. DON. REVIE.' CLOUGH stops. Looks at the sign. (CO NTINU ED)

S: INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: CLOUGH walks into the manager's office. The empty chair. The bare desk. His desk. Don's desk. CLOUGH takes a seat in the chair. Presently, a middle-aged matron, JEAN REID, Don Revie's faithful SECRETARY for 13 years, appears in the doorway..
C: CLOUGH
D: Any chance of a cup of tea, duck?
C: JEAN
D: They're waiting for you. Upstairs.
N: CLOUGH swings his feet on the desk.
C: CLOUGH
D: Who's that?
C: JEAN
D: The Directors.
C: CLOUGH
D: For me? Why?
C: JEAN
D: For the board meeting.
C: CLOUGH
D: Let them wait. Now, how about that cup of tea?
N: CLOUGH smiles sweetly, but JEAN stares at CLOUGH. She pointedly doesn't move. CLOUGH lowers his feet. CLOUGH (cont'd) All right, I'll go then. Wouldn't want to get off on the wrong foot. CLOUGH walks over to the door. Looks at the desk. CLOUGH (cont'd) Who's desk is that, love?
C: JEAN
D: Yours, Mr. Clough.
C: CLOUGH
D: Not mine. I didn't put it there, did I?
C: JEAN
D: Mr. Revie's.
E: CO NTINU ED

C: CLOUGH
D: Let's get rid of it then, shall we? Chairs, too. The whole bloody lot. Think it would be best if there were nothing of his left here.
N: CLOUGH reaches the door.. CLOUGH (cont'd) Were you his secretary?
C: JEAN
D: I was. For thirteen happy years.
C: CLOUGH
D: What's your name, pet?
C: JEAN
D: Jean, Sir. Jean Reid.
C: CLOUGH
D: In which case, no offence duck, but there's nothing I want typed on paper from you other than your resignation.
N: She gasps.. CLOUGH (cont'd) And you can change the locks on your way out. Don't want the ghost of troubled Don popping in now, do we? Rattling his chains. Scaring my young ones. CLOUGH puts his arms protectively round the BOYS, and leads them out of the door. JEAN REID stares, visibly shaken.
S: INT. BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: Half-a-dozen white-haired patriarchs sit at a large table. Matching blazers and matching brass. MANNY CUSSINS, SAM BOLTON, BOB ROBERTS, SYDNEY SIMON, PERCY WOODWARD. Aldermen and Rotary club members. Masons and businessmen. CLOUGH enters the boardroom. Indicates to JIMMY GORDON to look after the BOYS outside. Inside: matching curtains and carpets.
C: CUSSINS
D: Come in, Brian.
N: CLOUGH sits down at the head of the table. Rubs his hands together.. (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D:

D: Do what?
C: BOLTON
D: The interview. For Yorkshire TV.
C: CUSSIN
D: We've had a phone-call.
C: BOLTON
D: Not so much a phone-call. Bloody tirade.
C: CUSSINS
D: From Don. They only went and rung him. And ran some of your quotes by him. About how unhappy the players were. What "bad champions". Looking for a response.
C: BOLTON
D: Bloody got one, as well. He's gone berserk.
E: shudders to himself
C: CLOUGH
D: He had it coming. He shouldn't have done that piece in the Mirror should he? Saying he thought I was a daft choice.
C: BOLTON
D: He's entitled to his opinions.
C: CLOUGH
D: And I'm entitled to mine.
C: CUSSINS
D: And I'm entitled to MINE.
E: barks, flame on
N: The room falls silent. That got everyone's attention. (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: (2) CUSSINS (cont'd) I hired you to do this job because I think you're the best young manager in the country...
C: CLOUGH
D: Thank you. I'm the best old one, too.
C: CUSSINS
D: ...I also did it under the assumption that you'd be coming here wanting the best for the club. For the city of Leeds. So why do I still get the feeling this is all about you and Don?
C: CLOUGH
D: Of course it's just about me and Don. Always has been. But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders of Leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big white Colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means I won't sleep and won't eat until I take whatever that man's achieved and beaten it -- beaten it so I never have to hear the name "Don Fucking Revie" again -- beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is Brian Clough. Brian Clough uber fucking alles. Understand?

C: TAYLOR
D: I've heard he's a superstitious twat. Ey..! Help him, someone HELP him..!
E: calling out
C: CLOUGH
D: We grew up just a few streets apart, you know. In Middlesborough, close to Ayrsome Park. He'll have known my street, Valley Road - probably bought sweets from Garnetts Factory, where my dad worked.

N: CLOUGH on his knees, scrubbing, cleaning baths in the visiting team's washrooms.
S: INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)
N: CLOUGH puts on his suit. Ties his tie. He takes a bottle of vintage red wine from a cupboard. He places the bottles on his desk. Then puts two cut crystal glasses on his desk. His and Don's. A flicker of jealousy on PETER TAYLOR's face, almost like a wife - hurt that his friend is making such an effort for someone else. A knock on the door. JIMMY GORDON appears in the doorway..
C: JIMMY
D: They're here! Well, almost..
E: a confused look
S: EXT. CAR PARK - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)
N: CLOUGH rushes out of the doors, straightening his cuffs, straightening his hair, buttoning his jacket. First out to greet the arriving team. He turns the corner to see the LEEDS COACH a hundred yards down the street, the PLAYERS getting off the coach and walking towards him..
C: CLOUGH
D: What are they doing?
C: JIMMY
D: They've run out of petrol.
C: TAYLOR
D: No, it's that superstition, isn't it? Every away cup ties, Revie makes them walk the last hundred yards. TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".
N: CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set. Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand. CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..
C: CLOUGH
D: Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Brian Clough.
N: But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking, without even breaking stride.. ..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with Les Cocker and Syd Owen. CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'. TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at REVIE in disbelief.
S: EXT. DUG-OUT - TOUCHLINE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1968)

(CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: (3) "Beeeep", the REF's whistle blows. A Derby PLAYER rolls in agony, cries out, a terrible, cynical challenge. Horrified, JIMMY GORDON and PETER TAYLOR up on thier feet in protest..
C: TAYLOR
D: Referee..!
N: CLOUGH looks over to REVIE's bench. Sees REVIE and SYD OWEN quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off.. Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0. TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the game restarts.. TAYLOR (cont'd) C'mon, keep your shape! Close him down!
C: JIMMY
D: Think, Alan! To feet!
C: TAYLOR
D: Now sent it out wide!
N: CLOUGH doesn't join in. He continues to stare at REVIE in his dugout. Suddenly: "Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..
C: CLOUGH
D: What? He didn't fucking touch him! Ref! He DIVED! He fucking dived!
N: REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating. The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by, "Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in disbelief. Robbed. Deflated. The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game. CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds already on their next game... CLOUGH stares as they go.. 16aA

C: CON TINUE D:
D: CLO UGH You lot may all be internationals and have won all the domestic honours there are to win under Don Revie, but as far as I'm concerned, the first thing you can do for me is to chuck all your medals and all your caps and all your pots and all your pans into the biggest fucking dustbin you can find because you've never won any of them fairly. You've done it all by bloody cheating.
E: cont'd
N: Silence from the PLAYERS.. CLOUGH (cont'd) Mr. William Bremner. You're the captain. And a good one. But you're no good to the team and you're no good to me if you're suspended. I need you fit for every game, and I want good, clean, attractive football from my captain. Setting an example. CLOUGH turns to PETER LORIMER. CLOUGH (cont'd) Mr. Lorimer, I hope you were listening because you're as good a footballer as I've ever seen, but you know how I feel about the way Don let you harangue referees, fall over when you've not been touched, protesting and pointing, trying to get other players booked. We'll have no more of that. CLOUGH turns to JOHNNY GILES.. CLOUGH (cont'd) And you, Irishman. God gave you skill, intelligence, and the best passing ability in the game. What God did not give you was six studs to wrap around another player's knee.

D: Not with me as manager. Do that on my watch, you'll be fined and stuck in the reserves. Things are going to be a little different around here. Without Don. Might feel a little strange at first. Might pinch a little. Like a new pair of shoes. But if you want your grandchildren to remember you for being something other than the dirty buggers you all were, if you want to be loved as REAL champions, WORTHY champions, you're going to have to work. And improve. And change. Now let's start off by playing some seven-a-sides. PLAYERS stare at one another. Bristling. Disbelieving looks.
E: to all the PLAYERS nods to JIMMY GORDON
C: BREMNER
D: Don never did that.
C: CLOUGH
D: Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I never want to hear that man's name again. Ever. Next player who mentions it, or what he did or didn't bloody do in the good ol' days, will spend a week cleaning my boots. Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean, and sensible. No fifty-fifty's. CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short..
E: clapping hands
N: CLOUGH (cont'd) Right, I'll play myself. You might learn something, Irishman. Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts. CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys it into a distant goal.. CLOUGH (cont'd) Like to see Don fucking Revie do that, eh? CLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY GORDON quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the whistle.. (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: (4) The game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove himself, is soon darting about, calling out... CLOUGH (cont'd) (clapping hands) Here, son. To feet. Keep it simple. Think and give. On the deck. Nice and crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me. CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out.. "CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS". CLOUGH (cont'd) Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!! CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON runs up to NORMAN HUNTER..
C: JIMMY
D: Fucking matter with you? He said no fifty-fifty's.
N: HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS. Crowding the referee. Intimidating him.
C: HUNTER
D: What are you going to do about it? Book me?
N: JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on the floor. In agony. Holding his knee.
S: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DRESSING-ROOMS - SAME TIME

S: INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: The door flies open. CLOUGH storms into his office. He walks over to the desk. DON REVIE's desk. He unwraps the parcel, and takes out an axe.
C: CLOUGH
D: Stand back.
N: CLOUGH's SONS watch as their father violently swings the axe down onto the desk. The sickening sound of splintering wood.
S: EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)
N: CLOUGH watches the desk burn in a small bonfire outside. MANNY CUSSINS and several DIRECTORS walk out. They are surprised to see CLOUGH by the fire holding an axe...

C: BARBARA
D: Of course it's Pete.

S: INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - HALL - DAY - (1968)
N: PETER TAYLOR, similarly in disgrace with his family, similarly unable to go a single Sunday lunch without calling CLOUGH, whispers down the phone, terrified of his wife..
C: TAYLOR
D: You asked me to find a player with a good head. Experience. I've found one! He's perfect. Dave Mackay.
E: whispering, furtive

D: Dave Mackay?!? He's a hundred and fucking fifty.
C: TAYLOR

D: We haven't got until morning. Hearts have already made him an offer. Want him as their manager. Apparently they've already agreed terms.
C: CLOUGH
D: Well, what did you fucking call me for then?
C: TAYLOR
D: Because when I asked Bill Nick how done the deal was - he said ninety- nine per cent. CLOUGH's face.

D: Brian..? Love..?
S: EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE - DAY - (1968)
N: CLOUGH and TAYLOR emerge from a roadside cafe and walk towards their car. They've missed Sunday lunch. So it's Crisps. Sweets. Fizzy drinks. Almost childlike. Happier in one another's company than with their own families.
C: CLOUGH
D: Where would we play him?
C: TAYLOR
D: In the middle of the park. Somewhere he can see everything, use his loaf, and tell the kids what to do.
C: CLOUGH
D: We'll play him as a sweeper, then.
C: TAYLOR
D: Aye.
E: eating crisps
N: They climb into the waiting car...

S: EXT. MACKAY'S HOUSE - NORTH LONDON - DAY - (1968)
N: CLOUGH's car pulls up outside a house in a quiet terraced road in North London. TAYLOR checks it against the address on a piece of paper. The two men get out of the car...
C: CLOUGH
D: You know it's illegal. To sign someone on the sabbath.
C: TAYLOR
D: Is it? Then perhaps we should just shake on it today? And sign tomorrow?
E: immediately cautious
C: CLOUGH
D: What? And let Hearts in again in the morning? Fuck off. I'm not leaving here without a signature. CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path..
E: producing contracts
N: CLOUGH (cont'd) You'd bloody DO that, too - wouldn't you? Come all this way, then just "shake hands"? (shaking head) Dear oh dear. What would you DO without me?
C: TAYLOR
D: Hey, you would never have FOUND him if it weren't for me.

C: CLOUGH
D: You don't look happy, Uncle Sam.
C: UNCLE SAM
D: I'm not. What were you thinking? Going over my head like that? Why didn't you call?

N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D:

N: On the training ground: DAVE MACKAY, barrel-chested and older, voice like a bullhorn, is already bossing about the young players, urging them to "think"..
C: TAYLOR
D: Dunno. It was just obvious. McGovern in midfield, Mackay at the back, O'Hare up front. The skewer isn't it? In the shish kebab.
N: CLOUGH watches MACKAY passing the ball, creating space..

N: To everyone's amusement: CLOUGH sings to PETER TAYLOR, not his own wife.. CLOUGH (cont'd) "Try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion. Try, try, try and you will only come to this conclusion.." In another corner: MACKAY is amiably ribbing LONGSON..

C: LONGSON
D: All right, I admit it, I was wrong.
N: LONGSON starts eating his trademark felt hat. Much cheering as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty. Suddenly, DAVE MACKAY looks up, sees the television. Calls for quiet!! ON TV: a live awards presentation. From London. DON REVIE is being presented with an award...
C: REVIE
D: ..for Leeds to win the First Division title, and for me to be named as English Manager of the year...feels like a dream come true...

Let's show them some of the things we've been working on. Our changes in attitude, too. Our new outlook. New discipline. New approach. (a beat) Let's see some of you playing with a smile.

E: cont'd
C: TAYLOR
D: Yours.
C: CLOUGH

N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D:
C: CLOUGH
D: Well, I'm sure we all admire your loyalty...
C: UNCLE SAM
D: What I DIDN'T come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East.
C: CLOUGH
D: But the way I see it, there's no point being in this game unless you want to beat the best, and be the best, and that's all the people of Derby want. To see their team on top of the tree, Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it's really their interest you have at heart, not just impressing your friends in the Director's box, I suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business, keep your opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques, there's a good lad. Leave the running of this football club to the professionals.
C: UNCLE SAM
D: But professionals DON'T run the club, Brian, the Chairman does. And if it's true, that football is all about money, and that's the way it's going, that's suits us Chairmen just fucking fine..because we're the ones who've got it. SAM LONGSON lights a cigar, and walks off.

N: CLOUGH's face: shocked. Then, all of a sudden.... "RRRRROOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR", a roar goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and his henchmen leap to their feet, delighted. Applauding. The WHEEL-CHAIR FAN screams with delight. Makes a `wanker' gesture in CLOUGH's face. CLOUGH's face: darkening like thunder.
S: INT. DRESSING-ROOM - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)
N: CAPTION: "HALF-TIME: DERBY 0, LEEDS 1" The DERBY PLAYERS sit in the dressing-room. Shaking. Terrified. Trying to hide, find shelter, find protection. (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: Already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his tongue.. Presently, the door opens, and CLOUGH walks in, carrying a bottle of brandy, Remy Martin.
C: CLOUGH
D: Congratulations, lads! Beautiful! That was as perfect a half of terrible football as I've ever seen. The plan you've obviously been hatching to get me the sack has worked a treat, so you deserve a little celebration...
N: CLOUGH pours brandy into a tea-cup, gives it to a PLAYER.. CLOUGH (cont'd) You do want me to get the sack?
C: MCGOVERN
D: No, Boss.
C: CLOUGH
D: Then why the fuck did you give it to their most dangerous player, Johnny fucking Giles?
C: MCGOVERN
D: I didn't see him.
N: CLOUGH turns to another PLAYER, (JOHN O'HARE), pours him a shot of cognac...
C: CLOUGH
D: You want me to get the sack, Mr O'Hare?
C: O'HARE
D: No, Boss.

S: INT. MANGER'S OFFICE - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)
N: CLOUGH pacing in his office. Unable to watch. Like an expectant father. Presently the building reverberates with a large... RRRROOOAAAARRRRRRRRR. A goal. But scored by whom? Derby or Leeds? CLOUGH looks up at the clock. The clock on the wall shows it's 4.20. Visibly anxious, CLOUGH starts pacing again. Presently, another deafening... RRRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRRRR The building is almost brought to it's foundations.. CLOUGH looks up. Desperate to know. Derby or Leeds? But it's only 4.35. Game still not over. Not by a long way. CLOUGH carries on pacing. Walks from one side of the room to the next. Left to right. Right to left. Then, another stadium-shaking.. RRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR CLOUGH looks up at the clock. 4.55. This is intolerable. The game must be over now. CLOUGH cannot bear it a moment longer. He opens the door.
S: INT. CORRIDORS - BASEBALL GROUND - DAY - (1972)
N: CLOUGH walks down a corridor. Then runs. Then checks himself. Slows down. Dignity. Dignity. But still walks as fast as he can. CLOUGH turns a corner to the dressing-rooms and the tunnel, then sees PETER TAYLOR up ahead entering the tunnel from the pitch with several Derby PLAYERS.. CLOUGH stops. TAYLOR looks up. Sees CLOUGH. Their eyes meet. CLOUGH's eyes. TAYLOR's eyes. Words are not necessary. TAYLOR's smile says it all. CLOUGH runs towards TAYLOR. The two men embrace.
C: CLOUGH
D: And..?
C: TAYLOR
D: 2-1!!!
C: CLOUGH
D: Who scored?
C: TAYLOR
D: O'Hare. A brace. Oh, Brian, you should have seen his first. Turns Bremner inside out, nutmegs Madeley for good measure. It was beautiful. You'd think he'd been born in Rio de Janeiro, not Aber-bloody-deen..
N: CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk off down the corridor. TAYLOR (cont'd) What made you go for the Brandy?
C: CLOUGH

If I could offer Mr. Clough some advice ...I think he'd be better off keeping his opinions to himself...some of these allegations against Leeds United and his fellow professionals are an absolute disgrace...
N: AND WE'RE INTO A QUICKFIRE MONTAGE OF: CLOUGH appearing on half-a-dozen TV shows. Quick, controversial, charismatic, witty. A natural media star, (we intercut our actor with the genuine archive footage)

E: shudders playfully
C: DAVID FROST
D: It's really like the other House of Commons. You hate to mention him. Why?
C: CLOUGH
D: I hate to mention him why? Because he's a very talented man and I don't like him.
N: The audience laughs. CLOUGH (cont'd) He's a very, very talented man and his record is unsurpassable. But I just happen not to like him. And I don't like the way he goes about football either. Football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in your profession who don't like the way you do your bit.

C: CLOUGH
D: Beating Leeds United, obviously. Always a particular pleasure that.
C: COLEMAN
D: Brian, you've also done it on comparatively small gates, which I know has niggled you a little bit during the season.
C: CLOUGH
D: Niggled me, David, it's absolutely made me blazing. To be honest, I know what I want to achieve, I know what the people of Derby want us to achieve, but when you've got a chairman not wanting to put his hand in his pocket...
N: MICHAEL PARKINSON, the highest rating talk show on TV.. CLOUGH (cont'd) You ever see eighty five or perhaps ninety percent of chairmen talking - I'd love a few chairmen on your programme occasionally - I believe the very sight of them brings the game into disrepute (some clap in the audience). And every time they open their mouths it kills it. Because the very thing they've given me a lot of stick about over the years - about talking too much and going on television too much, there are the very people who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man - or men - can stop me talking to people like you. I love football. It's deep, it goes right down through. It's in every nerve, vein, you name it. It consumes me. And when I have to come and talk about I like the passions of football to come out. Because there are not enough in the game. (MO RE) (CO NTINU ED)

D: That's right. You were Chairman of Derby County before I came here. I remember that. When Derby County were at the fucking foot of the Second Division, when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full stop. And that's where you'd still fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the foot of the bloody Second Division, where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you. There would BE no Derby County without me, no league title, no Champions of England; not without Brian Clough.

Suppose it depends on your priorities. Players or prawn sandwiches? I know which I'd prefer. I know which honest, working class Derby supporters would prefer, too..

CLOUGH doesn't notice.. CLOUGH (cont'd) So he decides that he's had enough, that he can't bear being this lonely, and so he climbs up to the top of the one building still standing. The Post Office Tower. And then he jumps off. And he's falling down, down and down and down, the sixteenth floor, the fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and that's when he hears the phone ringing... CLOUGH looks down. And gets two unexpected shocks. The first is that his SON is already asleep. The second is, there is a tear running down his own cheek.

A boxer on his way to the ring. A gladiator on his way to the circus. He knocks on the door, and walks in. MANNY CUSSINS, SAM BOLTON and a third man. A stranger.
C: BOLTON
D: About bloody time.
C: CUSSINS
D: Where you been? I was about to send out a search party.
C: CLOUGH
D: Look, Mr. Cussins, I know it's not been the best of starts, but in my defence, there are a couple of things I'd like to say...
C: CUSSINS

E: double-takes
C: CUSSINS
D: We hear that's what you like to drive. A Mercedes?
C: CLOUGH
D: It's..what I used to drive at Derby. Yes.
C: CUSSINS
D: Well, we can't have Leeds United being outdone by Derby County, can we? So Martin here is going to take you over to his showroom and get you sorted out.
N: They begin to walk to the door. CUSSINS puts his arm round CLOUGH... (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: CUSSINS (cont'd) Also we figured if you were sitting in a spanking new car yourself, you might be a little more bloody lenient with your senior players, who've kicked off, as you can imagine - being denied what's rightfully theirs.
C: BOLTON
D: Never come between a footballer and his motor!
C: CLOUGH
D: No.

C: TAYLOR
D: What? Oh, no, Brian. They'll never do THAT. He's Chairman.
C: CLOUGH
D: I can't do it, Pete. I can't work with my hands tied, a Chairman telling me what I can or cannot do.
C: TAYLOR
D: You're picking the wrong enemy. The enemy's not Longson. It's Revie. And your obsession with Leeds.
C: CLOUGH
D: Don't be daft. We won the league, Pete. We're top dogs in Derby now. And Longson can't stand it. That's the problem.
C: TAYLOR
D: No, it's not. It's YOU. This monster in you. This mad ambition. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's good...a fire, that stirs everything up, and then there's this...this thing that takes you over...and destroys everything that is good in your life. TAYLOR's face...

C: TAYLOR
D: No, we won't. It's over, Brian. They'll never take us back. Not now.
C: CLOUGH
D: What about proper clubs? Like Manchester United? Or Spurs? Or England, now Alf's gone. Wouldn't you fancy that?
C: TAYLOR

C: BAMBER
D: Sign today, I'll give you a bonus of seven grand. Each.
C: TAYLOR
D: Seven grand? Y'hear that, Brian?
C: BAMBER
D: Plus a salary that exceeds by twenty percent what Derby were paying you.
C: TAYLOR
D: Very generous, Mike. Terrific.
C: CLOUGH
D: But those are first division wages.
C: BAMBER
D: First division's where I want this club to be.
C: CLOUGH
D: Are you sure you can afford it?
C: BAMBER
D: Are you sure you're worth it?
C: CLOUGH
D: Cheeky sod.
N: BAMBER offers his hand. CLOUGH stares at it.. CLOUGH (cont'd) We're going to need a holiday first.
C: BAMBER
D: Take as long as you like.
C: CLOUGH
D: Two weeks. Somewhere hot. On you.
N: BAMBER doesn't even flinch. Smiles..

C: ARCHER
D: You're a hard man to find, Mr. Clough.
C: CLOUGH
D: Who's looking?
C: ARCHER
D: My name's Keith Archer. Secretary of Leeds United football club.
N: CLOUGH looks up, can't help smiling..
C: CLOUGH
D: Then what are you doing here, Keith? Because from what I'm reading in my paper, and from what I hear on the jungle drums, you've got a bit of a problem at home with your manager flirting with the England job.
C: ARCHER
D: He's not flirting...
C: CLOUGH
D: `Ey, it says it right here.
E: indignant, pointing to newspaper
C: ARCHER
D: He's taken it.
N: CLOUGH turns, squints in the light... ARCHER (cont'd) Which bring me to the point of my visit. BARBARA and PETER TAYLOR look over from the beach, concerned. KEITH ARCHER smiles nervously, politely raising his hat... 137A OMITTED 137A 83A

D: Bloody hell. But we HATE Leeds.
C: CLOUGH
D: It's the top flight, Pete. The First Division.
C: TAYLOR
D: But we've given Brighton our word. And they've paid us the money.
C: CLOUGH
D: We can pay BACK the money. Bollocks to bloody Brighton. I'd go mad. We'd ALL go mad down there.
E: laughing now, a dismissive wave
C: TAYLOR
D: Please...give it a year. Give it a chance.
C: CLOUGH
D: A year? It'd be death. Death for us all.
C: TAYLOR
D: Mike Bamber is a good man..
C: CLOUGH
D: Oh, do me a favour..
C: TAYLOR
D: He had faith in us, offered us a job when no one would.
C: CLOUGH
D: He offered us a job. And now someone else has offered us a better one..and not just anyone. The best team in the country. C'mon, Pete, you know what that means.. It'd be the Charity Shield at Wembley in a months time. The European Cup after..

C: TAYLOR
D: Yes, Brighton is a small club..
C: CLOUGH
D: Fucking midgets.
C: TAYLOR
D: But at least we'd be together, you and me. We could build them up. Make them our own. Like we did with Hartlepools. Like we did with Derby.
C: CLOUGH
D: And then what? Bottle again as soon as it comes to the big time. That's always been the trouble with you, Pete. No ambition.
C: TAYLOR
D: And that's the trouble with you. Too much ambition. Too much greed. Too much everything.
C: CLOUGH
D: You knock it, but it's done you proud over the years. My "ambition". Without me - you'd still be stuck in Burton Albion. On the arse of the footballing earth.
C: TAYLOR
D: But without you I'd still have a job in Derby. A job and a home that I love. Yes, Brian - you're the shop window, I'll grant you that. The razzle and the bloody dazzle. But I'm the goods at the back. And without me, without someone to save you from yourself, you're not just half.. ...you're nothing.

C: CLOUGH
D: What's not working? I haven't been here five minutes, so how can anything be working yet?
C: CUSSINS
D: Still...the players aren't happy. We're not happy.
C: CLOUGH
D: So what do you want to do about it?
C: CUSSINS
D: If it's not working, then we'll have to part company.
C: CLOUGH
D: Fine. It'll cost you twenty-five grand.
N: The Leeds BOARD MEMBERS choke...
C: CUSSINS
D: What? For six weeks work?
C: CLOUGH
D: Plus three and a half grand for Jimmy Gordon. And an agreement that Leeds United will pay both our income taxes for the next three years.
N: The Leeds BOARD MEMBERS choke...
C: CUSSINS
D: That's bloody criminal.
C: CLOUGH
D: No, what's criminal, Mr. Cussins, is the way you as Chairman asked me to leave the room like that in front of the players. Your MANAGER. Going behind my back like that.
C: CUSSINS
D: I admit, that was wrong.
N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D:

N: CLOUGH and his SONS are packing together CLOUGH's belongings in a couple of boxes. A knock at the door.. DUNCAN MACKENZIE comes in, in track suit, a cigarette in hand. Ready for the day's training..
C: MACKENZIE
D: Just wanted to say, it's not right. They should have given you more time.
C: CLOUGH
D: Good lad.
C: MACKENZIE
D: Not just me that feels that way, either.
C: CLOUGH
D: The sad thing is, it won't work. You can't change a manager like a pair of socks. It'll happen once, to me - and never again.
N: CLOUGH shakes CLARKE's hand. `Rrrrinng', the phone rings. CLOUGH turns and picks up the phone. He listens, then.. (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: CLOUGH (cont'd) (into phone) All right. But you'll have to make it quick. CLOUGH hangs up. Looks at his SONS.. CLOUGH (cont'd) Something we have to do on the way. Won't take long.
S: INT. YORKSHIRE TV STUDIOS - DAY - (1974)

C: MITCHELL
D: Thanks for agreeing to this.
C: CLOUGH
D: No problem.
N: CLOUGH smiles. Uncharacteristically vulnerable. CLOUGH (cont'd) Go easy on me, though. There's a good lad.
S: INT. YORKSHIRE TV STUDIOS - DAY - (1974)
N: CLOUGH is led into the studio, and onto the `Calender' set, chatting to the SOUND MAN. CLOUGH's microphone is fixed, he is shown to his seat beside the PRESENTER's. Then CLOUGH notices a third (empty) seat beside his..
C: CLOUGH
D: What's this? We expecting guests?
N: Then CLOUGH looks up to see a distinctive BLUE BLAZER, with gold buttons approaching the set... Blue blazer. DON's blazer. (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: CLOUGH's face falls as DON REVIE and AUSTIN MITCHELL turn the corner, in conspiratorial conversation, and out to the seats.. It's a set-up! CLOUGH looks over at AUSTIN MITCHELL and the crew, who shiftily avoids CLOUGH's eyes.. CLOUGH (cont'd) You bastards! REVIE is put in the seat beside CLOUGH. Avoiding CLOUGH's eyes. REVIE rolls his neck, crosses his legs. Vast, intimidating REVIE. Ready for battle. Suddenly, the theme music plays, the FLOOR MANAGER counts down..
C: FLOOR MANAGER
D: Five, four, three.. The PRESENTER looks up..
C: MITCHELL
D: Good evening. Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United. We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don Revie.
N: MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH.. MITCHELL (cont'd) To Brian Clough first of all. What's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion?
C: CLOUGH
D: Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie...
C: REVIE
D: See? Not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face...
C: CLOUGH
D: ...but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his.

C: MITCHELL
D: Do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes, Don Revie? To replace you?
C: REVIE
D: Being very, very honest, I think it was a difficult job for anyone to do. But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't call him Clough because I won't take him down like that..
C: CLOUGH
D: Thank you.
N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: (3)
C: REVIE
D: ...I do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have.
C: CLOUGH
D: How did I do that, Don?
C: REVIE
D: Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were.
C: CLOUGH
D: Well, you WERE dirty, Don!
C: REVIE
D: That's not true. The last four seasons, we've topped the charts for entertaining football.
C: CLOUGH
D: And before that, you also topped ALL the disciplinary charts. You should have been docked points and sent DOWN to the second Division.
C: MITCHELL
D: And in fact, you went on record and said so, Brian Clough. Again and again. That Leeds should, in fact, be relegated.
C: CLOUGH
D: And I was right.
C: MITCHELL
D: Do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them?
C: REVIE
D: Of course it did! The things he said? Why, man? Why did you take the job in the first place?
C: CLOUGH
D: Because I thought it was the best job in the country.
C: REVIE
D: Of course it was the best job in the country.
C: CLOUGH

C: REVIE
D: I only lost four matches..
C: CLOUGH
D: Well, I can only lose three.
C: REVIE
D: No, no, no, no.
C: CLOUGH
D: And still play attractive, clean football. Without cheating!
C: REVIE
D: See, there he goes again..
C: MITCHELL
D: Listening to you, I am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both. It's more than that. It's personal. Am I right?
C: CLOUGH
D: Well, we're very different people, Don and I. We have different styles. In football and in life. I'm a warm man. An idealist. I do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook. Don is different. There's a hardness to him. A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware of it. But he's a cold person.
C: REVIE
D: You don't KNOW me!
N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: (6)
C: CLOUGH
D: And that lack of warmth. That coldness was there. Permeated the club when I arrived.
C: REVIE
D: I totally refute that. The atmosphere at Leeds was like a family. A happy family. You ask any of my players. I signed most of them personally. Knew their backgrounds. Their parents. Their streets. I was a father to them. In that club every morning. Massaging those boys. Did you do that for them?
C: CLOUGH
D: They would never have let me.
C: REVIE
D: Did you try? You didn't even try. I soaped those boys down with my own hands. You just went to Leeds with no thought for the club, no thought for the players. Just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me.
C: CLOUGH
D: Well are you surprised? What else was I going to do?? After what you did...
C: REVIE
D: What did I do?
C: CLOUGH
D: C'mon, Don. You know exactly.

N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: (7) CLOUGH (cont'd) 4th March 1968. See? I even remember the date. You came to Derby County, the third round of the FA Cup, and you refused to shake my hand. AUSTIN MITCHELL looks up. The CAMERAMEN look up.
C: REVIE
D: Never! Matter of principle! I always shake the other manager's hand!
C: CLOUGH
D: You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my trainer, Jimmy Gordon's.
C: REVIE
D: Then I probably didn't see you!!
C: CLOUGH
D: No, you saw me Don. But considered me beneath you. Looked down on me. And dismissed me. Just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country.
N: (CO NTINU ED) CON TINUE D: (8)
C: REVIE
D: Never would I knowingly refuse to shake a colleague's hand. The truth is, I probably just didn't know who you were.

E: blurts out
N: All heads turn. That came out unintentionally loud.
C: REVIE
D: Oh, we ALL know it now. We know you as the man who's constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute. Who had one of the best jobs in the country, at Derby, and managed to get the sack. Who had one of the best partners in the game, in Peter Taylor, and threw him away. Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United, a team that in ten years hasn't finished outside the top four, and took them to the bottom of the first division. Yes, it's fair to say we all know who you are now.
E: a beat
N: AUSTIN MITCHELL's eyes widen.
