T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. MIAMI LANDSCAPE - NIGHT
N: The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates ACROSS the SCREEN.
S: INT. UNMARKED VAN - IN MOTION - NIGHT
N: The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen- ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He looks to the rear.
C: FOUCHET
D: What's taking so long back there? CUT TO:
C: REAR
D: Where the rest of the gang waits. NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON, and CASPER. All dressed in black like Fouchet, except for ANDY. He stands and shows off his Miami PD uniform. His English is poor, yet he's got a big, happy-to-be- along grin on his face.
C: ANDY
D: How do I look? Like the real thing, yeah?
C: FOUCHET
D: Step back and lemme get a good look at you.
N: CLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the front.
C: FOUCHET
D: Tell me again about your assignment, Andrew?
C: ANDY
D: I'm the decoy.
C: FOUCHET
D: Right you are. Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN. BOOM!
S: EXT. VAN IN MOTION
N: Andy's body is blown through the rear doors as the van turns a corner.
S: INT. VAN - FOUCHET
N: He dials 911 on his cellular phone. Fouchet sounds distressed.
C: FOUCHET
D: Please help! I just saw a policeman shot! Send help. Hurry! I'm at the corner of...
S: EXT. NEAR DOWNTOWN - VAN - NIGHT
N: A stream of PD CARS haul past, lights blazing and SIRENS on full.
S: EXT. COLONY HOTEL (SOUTH BEACH) - NIGHT
N: Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with:
C: POLICE RADIO
D: Report of an officer down. Be advised, all units. Corner of Lennox and Taylor. Slipping by the street cop: Intro MARCUS BURNETT and MIKE LOWREY. They shimmy through the hotel doors.
E: V.O.
S: A7 INT. COLONY HOTEL - NIGHT A7
N: Where the buffed DESK MANAGER gets off the phone to greet the effeminate pair.
C: LOWREY
D: Good evening. I'm Mike --
C: BURNETT
D: -- And I'm Marcus.
C: LOWREY
D: We're lookin' for a couple of our Latin friends who checked in a little while ago. You might remember them?
C: A7 CONTINUED: A7 BURNETT
D: No chest hair. And packin'.
C: DESK MANAGER
D: I'm sorry. But our guest list is private.
C: LOWREY
D: Oh, didn't they say? There's going to be party! It's B.Y.O.B.O. -- The B.O. stands for baby oil.
E: leans in close
C: BURNETT
D: Maybe you can come. Get off after you get off? All three of them laugh.
C: DESK MANAGER
D: Well, now that you mention it. They were kinda cute. Suite 202.
S: INT. COLONY HOTEL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
N: Lowrey and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster their guns. The posing is over. This is business.
S: A8 INT. COLONY HOTEL - SUITE 202 - NIGHT A8
N: On the table are two briefcases. Each opened. One containing cocaine. The other, cash. A pistol next to each. REVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx. Then -- BANG! The door's kicked in and Lowrey's first through. Burnett on backup.
C: LOWREY
D: Police! On the floor! But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs. One goes left and the other, right. CUT TO:
C: B8 BEDROOM B8
D: Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered, Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:
C: LIVING ROOM
D: Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand. But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs of a chair.
C: BURNETT
D: Lowrey! Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles. Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for him.
S: A9 EXT. COLONY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION A9
N: Burnett and the other dealer come crashing out onto the balcony, then over onto an awning, rolling off onto some occupied cafe tables. Patrons scatter. Uniformed cops move in to assist.
C: LOWREY
D: appears soon after, walking down the hotel steps, leading the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket.
C: BURNETT
D: Nice backup.
E: scraped, bruised, pissed
C: LOWREY
D: What? We TILT UP as POLICE HELICOPTER flies overhead.
S: EXT. MIAMI BEACH SKYLINE - TITLE SEQUENCE - NIGHT
N: As OPENING TITLES RUN and MUSIC POUNDS -- we FLY OVER the causeways, waterways and hotels that line the beach. Something is happening in the balmy city as we CRUISE downtown and ZERO IN ON...
S: EXT. MIAMI'S OLDEST POLICE STATION (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT
N: The HELICOPTER ROARS low over the rooftops toward the causeway bridge.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - FOUCHET - NIGHT
N: As the helicopter passes over, he appears from behind a large exhaust port. Casper, Ferguson, and Noah behind him, all wearing high-tech miner's helmets with built-in radio headsets, and an array of high-tech tools.
C: FOUCHET
D: It's time. The team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning unit. They climb inside, carrying a six-foot-long metal case and what looks like a black scuba tank.
S: INT. AIR UNIT/SHAFTS
N: Though it's windy and cramped in here, at least it's cool. From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded onto the unit. TILT DOWN to see the various ducts. Endless. Bottomless. But clearly, Fouchet's a man who knows his way.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
N: Seemingly empty. From squad rooms to locker rooms to booking.
S: INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - GUARD STATION
N: OFFICER BILL O'FEE, 50s, reads a magazine and drinks coffee. Video monitors in front of him show the different lockers inside the evidence room. We see one room with stacks upon stacks of heroin.
C: IN AIR UNIT
D: The team, attached to cables, slide into the building's guts and disappear. STATIC CRACKLES:
C: FOUCHET
D: We're in. Start the video.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Kuni finds the conduit he's looking for, splices it, cuts into it with a Makita battery-powered circular saw, then attaches a handheld high-8 video machine and starts the video feed. The unit is strapped to the conduit.
S: INT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT
N: The MONITORS FLUTTER, then STABILIZE. Turning the page, O'Fee sugars his coffee.
S: INT. TRASH CHUTE ROOM - NIGHT
N: An air vent smashes to the floor. Two guys pull the metal case inside the room.
S: INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - HEROIN LOCKER - NIGHT
N: BANG! Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to the floor. Their headlights blazing, two men clamber into the cavernous room, Fouchet along with Casper. This is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts like butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred million dollars in heroin. Each kilo brick is stamped with a distinctive octopus logo.
C: FOUCHET
D: Where's Deputy Dog?
E: into mic
C: FERGUSON
D: He made us.
E: V.O. over radio mic
C: FOUCHET
D: Then do him, now!
C: GUARD STATION
D: Sure enough. As O'Fee stands from his desk -- CUT TO:
C: VENT ABOVE
D: Where Ferguson is waiting with an air-powered tranquil- izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that strikes O'Fee at the base of the neck. O'Fee stops. But before he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees buckle and he drops to the linoleum. Out cold.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - QUICK SHOTS - FERGUSON - NIGHT
N: One by one he moves backwards through the various levels of locks, torching each to look as if they'd entered the evidence room from inside the PD station. Meanwhile --
C: TRACH CHUTE ROOM
D: Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it inside the air shaft. Ferguson attaches the black "scuba tank," labeled "NITROUS OXIDE," to a valve. This is connected to a metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the floor. CUT BACK TO:
C: HEROIN LOCKER
D: Fouchet and Casper moving the stacks of heroin, placing them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once they're done, we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con- traption. A button is pushed -- and the sled is pulled at breakneck speed through the duct.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Bag after bag drops down the trash chute and tumbles into an open-roofed van where the last of the gang, Eddie Dominguez, waits with the ENGINE RUNNING.
C: IN AIR DUCT
D: The sled rockets by again -- WHOOSH -- loaded with more bags.
S: INT. HEROIN LOCKER
N: Casper and Fouchet throw the last of their gear down the chute and ride the sled out.
S: EXT./INT. VAN - POLICE STATION - ALLEY
N: One! Two! Three! Four! They all land atop the bags. Eddie GUNS the VAN, which rolls up the ramp and out the garage.
C: FOUCHET
D: Haul ass!
E: O.S.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - ALLEY - NIGHT
N: On the ledge the tape runs out and RECORDER EXPLODES. Pieces scatter.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: The van drives off into the golden sunrise of Miami. TITLES END.
S: EXT. LUXURY HIGH-RISE (COCONUT GROVE) - MORNING
N: One of those expensive condo buildings on Brickell Avenue with a circular driveway and a uniformed doorman.
S: INT. CONDO - MORNING
N: CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH expensive and trendy bachelor's lair. State-of-the-art everything, gorgeous artwork. Spectacular view. CAMERA STALLS ON -- a perma-plaqued newspaper clipping with a photo depiction of Lowrey and Burnett in front of a giant pile of black heroin, thumbs up to the camera. The headline reads: MIAMI PD RECORDS RECORD HEROIN BUST.
S: INT. LOWREY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Where Lowrey wakes up in a king-sized bed. The pain on his face and empty, scattered bottles tell us he's nursing a world-class hangover. He sits up, carefully, holds his aching head. Hearing BREATHING, Lowrey lifts the sheet next to him.
C: REVEAL THE LATINA
D: The one from the Colony Hotel. He drops the sheet back over her head, reaches over to his nightstand and grabs an industrial-sized bottle of Excedrin. Empty. He opens the nightstand drawer, extracts another bottle. Empty.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 9.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: All marble and brass. Lowrey opens up his medicine cabinet. Locating a new bottle of aspirin... he suddenly realizes that the SHOWER is RUNNING. Confused, he pulls open the shower curtain slightly. From the back, it's an incredible body, then she turns around and it's --
C: THE LATINA
D: Yes. The very same as the one he just saw in bed. What?
C: LATINA TWIN
D: 'Morning. Lowrey closes the curtain on her. Frowns at this impossibility. He steps back into the doorway and peers over at his bed. Yep, same face. Twins?
C: LOWREY
D: Oh man... He tears open the bottle of aspirin. Chug-a-lugs.
E: shaking his head
S: INT. BURNETT HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Burnett and his young wife, THERESA, are jarred awake by the CLOCK RADIO BLARING on the night stand. Theresa gropes for RADIO, shuts it OFF. Burnett playfully gropes for her.
C: THERESA
D: Marcus, what are you doing?
C: BURNETT
D: We're always saying we should spend more quality time together. Well, I got the time... and you got the quality... She laughs. He kisses her.
C: BURNETT
D: I can remember when we used to do it every morning.
C: THERESA
D: That was how we got a three bedroom house filled with little Burnetts. She crawls from bed.
C: BURNETT
D: Been over a week since I've had some quality time!
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 10.
S: INT. BURNETT'S KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Pandemonium. There's the two-and-a-half-year-old, MEGAN, who's taking bites of food and spitting it back out, looking at it, then putting it back in. Six-year- old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the fridge. And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side- stepping his eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and ball. He body-checks Jill against the ice box.
C: JILL
D: Mom, Quincy pushed me.
C: QUINCY
D: Uncle Mike showed me that move.
C: THERESA
D: Quincy, never-you-mind. And take those things off in the house! Jill, stop with the book and eat your breakfast. Marcus, why do I always have to discipline the kids? You play bad cop for a second. Alongside the kitchen screen door we see Lowrey's PORSCHE ROAR to a stop in the driveway.
E: then, exasperated
C: BURNETT
D: Kids, knock it off... or your momma's gonna whoop your butts! Theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue to fight. Into this craziness enters Mike Lowrey...
C: LOWREY
D: Ah, family life. Reminds me why I stay single. JILL & QUINCY Uncle Mike! Uncle Mike!
C: LOWREY
D: Hiya, kids. Mornin', Theresa. Lowrey pecks Theresa on the cheek. She recoils.
C: THERESA
D: Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't know where those lips were last night.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 11.
C: QUINCY
D: Tell us some stories, Uncle Mike. You know, the one about the stewardess?
C: THERESA
D: Don't go tellin' my son about your sleazy sex life?
C: LOWREY
D: I promise, Theresa. I only tell your husband about my sleazy sex life. The TELEPHONE RINGS.
C: THERESA
D: I don't want him knowing about it either! Gives him ideas. Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of them do you want? Lowrey accepts the phone from Theresa and talks.
E: answers the phone
C: LOWREY
D: You're live with Lowrey. 'Scuse me, Captain. I think you mean to say, 'Get the fuck down here, please?' Burnett automatically pulls on his jacket, hugs the children as Lowrey hangs up.
E: listens for a long beat
C: THERESA
D: Not so fast. You were going to take the kids to school today, remember, hon? I have a job interview... Lowrey rolls his eyes.
S: EXT. BURNETT'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Burnett's following Lowrey and the kids out his front door when his neighbor, DICK, accosts him from across the hedge. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 12.
C: DICK
D: Hey, Marcus. Did you know we got busted into again last night? When are you gonna do something about this?
C: BURNETT
D: Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta tell you? I don't work robbery. I'm in Narcotics. Meanwhile, Lowrey's holding the car door open as the kids pile into the jump seat in the back.
C: LOWREY
D: Don't get your sticky fingers all over my windows... and keep your feet off the seats, I just had the leather conditioned. The kids ignore him, gleefully continuing to squirm around. Before Burnett can get into the car, Theresa runs out.
C: THERESA
D: Marcus... I need you to stop at Save-More on the way home and pick up exactly what's on the list. She hands Burnett a long list.
C: BURNETT
D: Oh, baby. Damn. Lowrey shakes his head.
S: A39 EXT. MIAMI P.D. - DAY A39
N: Lowrey and Burnett pull up in Porsche.
S: B39 INT POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY B39
N: Lowrey and Burnett walking.
C: BURNETT
D: Twins?
C: LOWREY
D: If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'. Her sister came down and posted the girl's bail. And later? Man, talk about special effects.
C: BURNETT
D: What special effects?
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM A12A.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
C: LOWREY
D: Tell you later -- Mornin', Francine. Where's the smile?
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/20/94 12A. FRANCINE, a civilian employee of the narcotics unit. She's got pictures of her children parked around her computer desktop. And though dowdy would be a compliment, she's usually got a pleasant smile for the boys. Except today...
C: FRANCINE
D: Evidence room. Howard's waiting for you.
C: BURNETT
D: Your kids are lookin' sharp, Francine. She smiles.
S: INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Burnett and Lowrey know there's big problems when, at the bottom of the stairwell, the first thing they see is a yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched lock. Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over the evidence room. INTRO - SANCHEZ AND RUIZ
C: SANCHEZ
D: Let's see. There's Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy, Bashful... Now, who could we be missin'?
C: RUIZ
D: Could it be... Dopey? Both laugh hysterically, while:
C: LOWREY
D: If it ain't the leftovers from Miami Vice. Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties.
C: BURNETT
D: And the women really go for that. Really, they do. As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a paramedic team. He's still out cold. An oh shit look passes between the two partners.
S: INT. HEROIN LOCKER - DAY
N: Another torched lock noted as Burnett and Lowrey enter with Sanchez an Ruiz behind them. The room is emptied. Captain HOWARD appears. He's short, has a military haircut, and has a minor Napoleon complex and a major in paranoia.
C: HOWARD
D: Nice of you to roll in. And nothing particular is going on around here except, maybe, your dope is gone. That's right. The biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we don't get the shit back.
C: BURNETT
D: This can't be happening.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 14.
C: HOWARD
D: So here's what we're gonna do. Since it was originally your case, you two guys are on point. Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need. Groans all around.
C: LOWREY
D: So I guess we should start with the C.I.s and the perps from the original case. But hell if I know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off. They're either dead or in the lock-up pending trial.
C: BURNETT
D: How's O'Fee?
C: SINCLAIR
D: Oh, he'll be just fine. From the side appears a cigar-chewing Internal Affairs suit named SINCLAIR. He circles close to Burnett and Lowrey, waving his cigar as he speaks.
E: O.S.
C: HOWARD
D: Name's Sinclair. Internal Affairs. He's our new proctologist.
C: SINCLAIR
D: You see, what's got me confused is, why risk leaving a witness? Why not kill O'Fee instead?
C: BURNETT
D: Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast.
C: SINCLAIR
D: And who knows that better than anybody else? Cops.
C: BURNETT
D: You're not sayin' this was an inside job. Cops wouldn't pull this shit.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 15.
C: SINCLAIR
D: Not just cops. Narcotic cops. For example, the S.N.D. You've got access. You've got wherewithall. And most importantly, you've got the connections. Who else would know how to unload a hundred million dollars worth of heroin?
C: LOWREY
D: Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off- the-rack suit.
C: HOWARD
D: Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's nothing we can do about it. If any of this leaks, the shit's gonna hit our biggest fan. Remember him? The mayor? He created us and you can bet your jobs, boys, he'll rip us into little cop pieces. I figure we got seventy-two hours to find the dope and keep our jobs.
C: LOWREY
D: Nothing like a little old-fashioned incentive.
C: CLOSE ON BURNETT
D: He walks to the center of the room and kneels to those four bolt holes in the floor. He fingers the paraffin filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate.
C: BURNETT
D: What about the air conditioning?
C: HOWARD
D: So what about it?
C: BURNETT
D: What do you think?
E: to Lowrey
C: LOWREY
D: I think you should go ahead, crawl up and give it a good look.
C: BURNETT
D: Why me?
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 15A.
C: LOWREY
D: For one, it was your idea. Two, while my suit's fresh, you're dressed for the occasion.
C: BURNETT
D: Don't say nothin' about my clothes. I paid for these.
C: LOWREY
D: And I don't?
C: BURNETT
D: Not on a cop's salary.
S: INT. HEROIN LOCKER - INSIDE SHAFT - BURNETT
N: Burnett crawls up with some help from Lowrey below, stalling the oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling through. The first thing Burnett notices are the track marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust.
C: LOWREY
D: Anything?
C: BURNETT
D: Yeah. I got some weird track marks in here. Then Burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint. It reads: ORONA AIR CONTITIONING SYSTEMS, INC.
S: INT. HEROIN LOCKER ROOM - ON HOWARD
N: Who appears from below, framed in the vent shaft.
C: HOWARD
D: Nice and cool up there, Burnett? Comfy? Maybe there's a new career for you in building maintenance.
S: INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY
N: Lowrey and Burnett with their desks opposite each other. The CAMERA CIRCLES while they lay the arm on some informants.
C: BURNETT
D: There's gonna be a lotta cash when the dope hits the street. We want you to put the word out through your bank and hustle the account. You help us, maybe we can see about getting those R.T.C. auditors off your ass.
C: LOWREY
D: Listen, Cedras. You and I both know you're the number one importer for the Simona Brothers. And I'm tellin' you there's a buttload of H on the move and someone's gonna wanna stick their dick in it. So it better not be yours. You hear something? You call us. You hear nada? You better get the fuck outta town.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 17.
S: INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY
N: Lowrey's driving, no seatbelt, doing his usual speed- weaving. Burnett's hanging onto the handle above the door.
C: BURNETT
D: Not a fucking lead. So now that we've done the obvious, we need a shortcut.
C: LOWREY
D: Okay. So we talk to Max.
C: BURNETT
D: Huh uh. Not this time. I'm tired of you working pussy into everything we do.
C: LOWREY
D: You got a better idea?
S: A46 EXT. CONGRESS GYM - ESTABLISHING - DAY A46
N: Lowrey and Burnett arrive in the unmarked car.
S: INT. CONGRESS GYM - DAY
N: Once-colorful stucco, fading and crumbling. Scrappy Cuban fighters spar and work out on the aging equipment while, at the same time, a remarkable amount of amazing- looking women work out on weight bags, shadow box with trainers. Curves and sweat, any way you look. BURNETT AND LOWREY enter. And while Lowrey cruises amongst the sweaty flesh as if it were a day in the park, Burnett lags. Maybe he has been married too long.
C: CLOSE ON MAX LOGAN
D: she's doing sit-ups on an incline bench. She notices Lowrey.
C: MAX
D: Hi, Mike. You come to work-out?
C: LOWREY
D: Raincheck, darlin'. Gotta talk. Anyplace we can go?
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 18.
C: MAX
D: Equipment room. Hiya, Marcus. How's your wife?
C: BURNETT
D: Huh?
C: MAX
D: That's what I thought.
S: INT. EQUIPMENT ROOM - DAY
N: This room isn't enclosed. It's walled by wire mesh. Private enough, though. Max shuts the door.
C: LOWREY
D: Sorry to come around only when I need something.
C: MAX
D: Forget about it. I owe you the rest of my life, Mike. Lowrey just gives her an "oh please" look.
C: MAX
D: Don't be lookin' at me like I'm getting all sentimental.
C: LOWREY
D: Hey, I didn't open my mouth. Listen, there's some major, major ill shit happening down at the P.D. Lotta heroin involved. There's gonna be a lotta cash involved, too. Gonna be some happy motherfuckers around that wanna party.
C: MAX
D: So you want me to check around?
C: LOWREY
D: Just make a coupla calls. See what's what. Don't be doin' no wild shit. Just call me if you hear something.
S: INT. BOXING GYM - DAY
N: Burnett is surrounded by beautiful, sweaty women. One of them is a fabulous BLACK WOMAN with legs so long and toned, they're not just legs, they're weapons. Burnett can't help but stare. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 19.
C: BLACK WOMAN
D: Who's Max's friend?
C: BURNETT
D: A cop.
C: BLACK WOMAN
D: Oooh. I love cops. The other girls are suddenly interested, too. Burnett swallows and...
C: BURNETT
D: You know? I'm a cop. I shot somebody just last week. Didn't kill him, just shot him in the ass. Stone cold looks from them all. They walk away with Burnett giving a "what did I say" look. Lowrey appears.
C: LOWREY
D: You know, that was really smooth. Think you could do that again? Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife gets meaner, the grass gets greener.
E: as they start walking
C: BURNETT
D: Green ain't the color I was thinkin' of. More of a coco puff. Just real shiny, thick...
S: EXT. BOXING GYM
N: As they head toward their car, Burnett's BEEPER SOUNDS. He switches it OFF.
C: BURNETT
D: Damn! The woman's got fuckin' radar on my ass. Sensed me lookin' at another woman. Bet she wants me to pick up Huggies 'stead of those baby Garanimals that they wear.
C: LOWREY
D: I don't think anybody could be that married.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 19A.
S: INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR - IN MOTION - DAY
N: Burnett drives cautiously while both he and Lowrey bob to Ice-T's "COP KILLER." They get a kick out of the song.
C: LOWREY
D: Miami's the perfect town for you, Burnett. You drive like a one- hundred-seven-year-old lady with her turn signal on.
E: complies
C: BURNETT
D: And I plan on living to be old just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay on my joints and everythin'.
N: An old guy passes them even though his car is pulling an Airstream camper behind it. Lowrey can't believe it.
C: LOWREY
D: You gonna let every old motherfucker pass you? Or just the ones with big-ass trailers draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.
C: BURNETT
D: I don't have a death wish like you. I got a family that counts on me. A mortgage to pay. And I'm not sayin' it's me, but most of the guys in the station think you're some rich kid playin' cop.
C: LOWREY
D: Who said that?
N: Burnett mumbles an answer.
C: LOWREY
D: If somebody's talking about me, I wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of this. I don't apologize for nothing I do. I get up early and take it to the max every day. I'm always the first guy through the door. And the last guy to leave a crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I could give a shit what those boot lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin' motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey. What can Burnett say to all that, but...
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 20.
C: BURNETT
D: I love you, man. He lets loose a big grin.
C: LOWREY
D: Oh, fuck you, Marcus. The RADIO CRACKLES.
C: DISPATCHER
D: Two-one? I got that address for you on the air conditioning company. Oh, and Theresa called, she added something to your grocer list: Muppets toothpaste. Bubble gum flavor. She says Quincy doesn't like mint. Lowrey rolls his eyes, glances at Burnett, who's embarrassed.
E: V.O. over radio
C: LOWREY
D: Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the address.
C: DISPATCHER
D: Orona's been working out of his house. He's at...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. KEY BISCAYNE ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
N: Burnett and Lowrey step from their unmarked car and start up the steps to this stony, estate-sized house.
C: LOWREY
D: The air conditioning business has been good to Orona. Lowrey rings the bell. They wait. No answer.
C: BURNETT
D: Well, we can leave a note or we can break and enter --
C: LOWREY
D: Wait. Hear that? I thought I heard Orona beating his wife.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 21.
S: INT. ESTATE - REAR DOOR
N: Lowrey kicks the door in.
C: LOWREY
D: Uh oh. No alarm.
C: BURNETT
D: Aw, man. Did you cut one?
C: LOWREY
D: No, man. Musta been you.
C: BURNETT
D: Not me. Lowrey and Burnett look at each other and draw guns.
C: LOWREY AND BURNETT
D: Dead guy.
S: INT. ORONA'S DEN - DAY
N: The door is unlocked and swings open easily to reveal Lowrey and Burnett in an instant, repulsed reaction to Orona's body which sits upright in his office chair, the body grotesque and bloated.
C: LOWREY
D: Now what? A sickened Burnett goes over to the body, speaking to Orona as if he were alive.
C: BURNETT
D: Where are the drugs? Where... are... the... drugs? He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must be guilty of somethin'. Meanwhile, Lowrey's got no problem with the dead body. He tries opening a desk drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis- stiffened knee is in the way. So Lowrey gives it a shove and the chair swivels. Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp off the desk.
E: no answer shrugs
C: BURNETT
D: Whoa. Watch where you're swinging them dead arms, Orona. You're gonna fuck up your own crime scene.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 22. Lowrey braves the body and gingerly pokes around his pockets.
C: BURNETT
D: Watch what you touch. That's evidence.
C: BURNETT
D: Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona. You've got the right to remain silent. Anything you say'll surprise the shit out of us.
C: BURNETT
D: Anything?
C: LOWREY
D: Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta bookies. Phone numbers.
E: finds small notepad
C: BURNETT
D: Lemme guess. Guy does the air conditioning contract for the P.D. He'd have the plans.
C: LOWREY
D: He trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps.
C: BURNETT
D: Works for me. Now can we go? I'm gonna puke.

N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 23.
C: CONTINUED: MAX
D: Please, Lois. Make some calls. That's all. I'm looking for a party with fresh cash.
E: A1
C: LOIS
D: I'm not doing any favors for Mike Lowrey.
C: MAX
D: Then call it a favor for me. Please?
C: LOIS
D: Okay, then. I'll make the calls. But you have to talk to Julie.
C: MAX
D: I'll talk to her but she's not into it.
C: LOIS
D: All you have to say is that she'll be getting paid for what she already does for free.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 24.
C: MAX
D: And she'll say, 'There's one big difference. I do it for fun. I don't ever have to blow anyone I don't like.' CUT TO:
C: FRONT DOOR
D: It swings open to reveal JULIE MOTT, 24, just as beautiful as Max and dressed to be undressed. She drops one of those big, model's shoulder bags to the floor and gazes curiously back at Lois and Max. Her ears are burning.
C: JULIE
D: Okay. So what'd I miss?

D: Okay. Mark.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 25.
C: JULIE
D: Oooh. Bad loser and bad, bad blonde. Farrah, frosted kinda big bad blonde. Oooh. Max laughs.
C: JULIE
D: But that's my point. I remember my hair phases more than I remember the men. So, a party in a Biltmore Hotel suite? Yeah, that'll really rock.
E: playful, sarcastic
C: MAX
D: It's a favor for a friend. If it sucks after a half-hour, we'll split and head to South Beach.
C: JULIE
D: A favor?
C: MAX
D: You know, my friend Mike Lowrey.
C: JULIE
D: Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you just have sex with the man and get it over with.
E: rolls her eyes
C: MAX
D: He's just a friend.
C: JULIE
D: Yeah, right. You're in love.
C: MAX
D: It's never gonna happen. I'm great at turning lovers into friends. But turning friends into lovers, I can't do.
C: JULIE
D: Well, I don't date cops. They never have enough money and they're always too tired to screw.
C: MAX
D: Well, I've told you before, my Mike isn't like that. If I were in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is the only person I'd call.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 25A.
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - AL CAPONE'S SUITE - DUSK
N: Upon arrival, the door is opened to Max and Julie by Eddie Dominguez, instantly recognizeable from the heist. Eddie's pouring champagne into a glass.
C: EDDIE
D: Max, my little carina. It's been a long time. And who's your friend?
C: MAX
D: Eddie. Julie.
N: Julie sizes him up. Good taste. His suit. Bad taste. His personality.
C: EDDIE
D: Come on, Julie. Come in, Max. Welcome to the Al Capone suite. Thev're stepped into a grand, opulent suite. High arched ceilings. Magnificent antique furniture. Killer view. No party guests.
C: EDDIE
D: I'm not kidding. Capone had the place fixed up with secret passages and hidden stairways. Can you dig it? People were actually killed within these walls. He's moved behind them and reveals a concealed staircase that rises into darkness.
C: CLOSE ON JULIE
D: Not happy. Stuck at the Biltmore with a Scarface wannabe. She looks over at Max. Let's get outta here.
C: JULIE
D: Excuse me? I need to use the bathroom. Julie crosses to the bathroom.
C: EDDIE
D: Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped off the edge of the earth and died. Either that or you moved to California.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 25B.
C: CONTINUED: MAX
D: So, Eddie. Looks like we're way too early. How's about we come back later?
E: A1
C: EDDIE
D: No. Don't go yet. We can party. Just us three. Look at what Eddie's got to play with. From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of heroin. Max tries to hide the recognition that she just hit paydirt on the very first try.
S: INT. BATHROOM - JULIE
N: Where she's silently cursing Max for getting her into this lame-ass party when she hears MUFFLED VOICES outside the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through the louvered shades. JULIE'S POV - THROUGH SHADES She sees Eddie opening the door to Fouchet. Casper and Noah follow him inside.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. AL CAPONE SUITE
N: Eddie is instantly nervous in the presence of Fouchet.
C: FOUCHET
D: Who's the girl, Eddie?
C: EDDIE
D: Just a hooker --
C: MAX
D: My name's Max. I'm just a friend.
E: outstretched hand
C: FOUCHET
D: I could use a friend who looks like you. Turn around. Lemme get a good look. Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit. She does her best model's turn. Slowly giving him a view of the rear when -- Fouchet draws a PISTOL -- BAM BAM!! Max tumbles forward and CRASHES through a GLASS TABLE.
S: INT. BATHROOM - JULIE
N: Instant horror. Julie saw Max killed and retreats to the opposite side of the bathroom in total fright.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. CAPONE SUITE
N: Now, Fouchet swings the gun onto Eddie.
C: FOUCHET
D: You're a fucking idiot. Hookers talk. Now, is that my dope?
C: EDDIE
D: Our dope... That was the deal, yeah? Right. Until we got the money -- BAM! Fouchet SHOOTS Eddie in the knee. Eddie screams!
E: freaked
C: EDDIE
D: You fucker... fucker fucker fucker!!!
C: FOUCHET
D: I have four more days until I make the deal. When it's done you get your money. Now, what part don't you understand?
C: EDDIE
D: Hey, man. You need me.
C: FOUCHET
D: I don't need anybody. I got three little angels looking over my shoulder.
N: REVERSE SHOT - EDDIE'S CHAIR Fouchet UNLOADS THREE MORE SHOTS. BAM BAM BAM!!! Blood spatters onto Casper.
C: CASPER
D: Aw, man. You got blood on my new suit.
C: FOUCHET
D: Ever hear of dry cleaning? Now, shut the fuck up, check for the rest of my dope.
S: INT. BATHROOM - JULIE
N: Half-panicked, half-trying to keep her head. There's no way out of the bathroom. All she can do is switch off the light. And now she sees Casper's shadow as he approaches.
C: CLOSE ON DOORKNOB
D: As it turns. Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls open the door with a surge. Casper stumbles in, his face hitting the hard tile with a crunch.
S: INT. CAPONE SUITE - JULIE
N: Making her move, she hauls as fast as she can across the room. Aiming for that secret fireplace door.
C: FOUCHET
D: Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the suite. Julie dives right into the secret door.
S: INT. SECRET PASSAGEWAY - SAME TIME
N: Dark. Twisting. We MOVE WITH Julie as she races through it, heart in her throat. She comes upon some old metal stairs, a sliver of light at the top, and clambers up...
S: EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT
N: High atop the Biltmore, this is where the passageway leads out to. A door flies open and Julie appears. Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie sprints as best she can across the Spanish-tiled roof. Turns to see --
S: EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT
N: Noah and Casper appear in the Bell Tower. Noah scans the roof, takes aim and FIRES, but he's too far away -- and Julie disappears behind a rise in the roof.
S: EXT. BILTMORE - ROOFTOP - JULIE - NIGHT
N: She steps towards the edge of the roof. Quickly peers over. A huge swimming pool, five stories down. She weighs the options. Jump or die.
C: NOAH AND CASPER
D: As they try running across the harsh-tiled roof...
C: CASPER
D: Now look. My fuckin' shoes. My fuckin' Italian shoes! Then Julie prays silently, takes a running start and leaps from the roof. SLOW-MOTION as Julie flies through the air like some glamorous angel.
S: EXT. BILTMORE POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
N: as Julie breaks the surface with a huge splash. The water swirls as her aching body struggles to the surface.
S: EXT. BILTMORE POOL - SURFACE - NIGHT
N: Julie breaks water like a dolphin, gasping for breath. She's dazed and confused, but alive -- for the moment.
S: INT. AL CAPONE SUITE - NIGHT
N: Fouchet reaches down and picks up Max's purse, then flicks it across the room to the defeated pair of Casper and Noah.
C: FOUCHET
D: She's a hooker. Find out who she works for. Find out where she lives.
S: EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - HALF-HOUR LATER
N: Several police cars, an ambulance and a coroner's van are now parked in front, the lobby awash in strobing red and blue lights. CAMERA PANS PAST the crime scene personnel to find Burnett and Lowrey pulling up to the scene. They get out and thread their way through the growing chaos.
S: INT. BILTMORE - AL CAPONE SUITE - NIGHT
N: The place is a mess. Homicide detectives are already on the scene, drawing chalk circles around casings on the floor. On the far side of the commotion, the two bodies have been photographed and are covered. Chief Howard is conferring with a technician who's dusting for prints.
C: BURNETT AND LOWREY
D: enter. But Sanchez and Ruiz are already on the scene.
C: RUIZ
D: You guys watch where you're walking or you'll fuck up the crime scene.
C: BURNETT
D: Looks like you're already doing that. Burnett's quick to point out the trail of bloody foot- prints Ruiz just tracked across the carpet.
C: CLOSE ON CHAMPAGNE GLASS
D: Which Julie left on the fireplace mantel. Lowrey's quick to note the two separate shades of lipstick.
C: HOWARD
D: Two dead. A hood registered as Eddie Dominguez and some Jane Doe. But the table over there's covered in high-grade dope. Sound familiar?
C: LOWREY
D: I think we got us a witness. Over here I got two different shades of lipstick on one champagne glass. Meanwhile --
C: BURNETT
D: He drops the sheet on Eddie's body, then moves over to Max's. He doesn't know it's her until --
C: BURNETT
D: Jesus, no...
C: LOWREY
D: Whatcha got?
N: Burnett drops the sheet, turns and puts a protective shoulder between Lowrey and the body.
C: LOWREY
D: What? Who is it? Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels at the body. He pulls back the sheet. Right now he could kill the shooter, then himself. In that order. Lowrey's eyes well up.
C: LOWREY
D: I shoulda told you to be careful.
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT
N: The elevator doors open and out step Burnett and Lowrey into a lobby full of cops. Lowrey goes straight to the front desk.
C: LOWREY
D: Eddie Dominguez. I want his phone calls. He flashes a badge.
C: HOTEL CLERK
D: You pay the bill you can see his phone calls.
C: LOWREY
D: I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't polite enough. With a flashing right jab, Lowrey pops the snooty Clerk. After the Clerk finds his feet, eyes peering over the counter...
C: BURNETT
D: I wouldn't fuck with him right now.
S: EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Walking down the steps toward their car, Lowrey passes the phone sheet off to Burnett.
C: LOWREY
D: Three calls to Lois Fields. I'm going to stop by her place and tell her a bedtime story. You can catch a ride with Howard. Lowrey jumps in the car.
C: BURNETT
D: Uh oh... Alright, you check out Lois, then check in --
S: INT. LOIS FIELD'S MANOR - MASTER SUITE - NIGHT
N: Replete with balcony and billowy curtains, the old-styled madame LOIS FIELDS sits up on her bed covered in pillows and exotic stuffed animals. She thumbs an old, leather- bound looseleaf binder full of modeling photos and resumes.
C: LOIS FIELDS
D: I'm sorry, Jimmy. But you can't have her. Shelly only models and that's all... That's right. Like I always say, some girls do, some girls don't, and the rest you can't afford -- Hello? Jimmy... Jimmy? Suddenly, the power is cut.
E: line cuts out

S: EXT. LOIS FIELD'S MANOR - NIGHT
N: Lowrey parks the Porsche.
S: INT. LOIS FIELD'S MANOR - NIGHT
N: The door is open and the deadbolt looks smashed with something heavy like a sledgehammer. Lowrey pulls a radio with one hand and his pistol with the other. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 33.
C: LOWREY
D: This is twenty-one two. I'm gonna need back-up at 614 Reach Road. Lowrey eases inside the darkness of the doorway. He checks the lights, but the power is off. Slipping the radio into his coat pocket, he returns with a mini- flashlight and begins to clear a path, doorway by doorway, then moving up a wide stairwell.
E: into mic
S: INT. MIAMI PD - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
N: Howard is sitting at the edge of the desk while Burnett is on the phone with Theresa.
C: HOWARD

C: BURNETT
D: Following this Lois Fields lead. I just paged him.
E: hand over phone

D: The madame? What's it with this guy? It's always girls, girls, girls.

E: as Theresa screams
S: INT. LOIS FIELD'S MANOR - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT
N: MOVING THROUGH the doors of the master suite where a light breeze blows through balcony of sheer curtains, Lowrey turns ever-so-slowly with his flashlight following a beat behind. The beam comes to rest on a bludgeoned body laying on the bed amongst huge pillows and exotic stuffed animals. The telephone cord is wrapped around her neck. Lowrey's closer inspection reveals -- BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 34.
C: LOIS'S CLIENT BOOK
D: Where an obvious page and photo have been ripped out. Julie's. Lowrey goes for the phone. Picks it up with his handkerchief. No dial tone. So he drops the receiver and heads out of the room. But just as he reaches the doorway -- Suddenly -- Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS. He jumps. Reaches down to switch it off when -- From out of those billowing curtains -- Noah! Sledgehammer in hand, he swings at Lowrey, who instinc- tively blocks and ducks as the hammer misses and crushes the bannister railing. It gives under Lowrey's weight, who reaches over and traps the sledgehammer, only to find one of Noah's hammy fists battering him behind the ear until -- The rail finally gives way. Lowrey falls and crashes onto a Craftsman table covered in antique picture frames. It collapses underneath him. Then --
C: CLOSE ON LOWREY'S RADIO
D: Laying next to him. It SQUAWKS LOUDLY...
C: BACK-UP COPS
D: Pulling up now, twenty-one-two. Give us your twenty in the residence... twenty-one-two. Do you copy. Twenty-one-two... The CAMERA LIFTS to reveal that Noah has vanished.

C: BURNETT
D: I can't be Lowrey.
C: HOWARD
D: Shut up and listen! She'll only talk to Lowrey. She says she's our witness. That means she's our only link to the dope, not to mention my pension plan, so get on the phone. Burnett accepts the phone. Hand over the receiver, he does a quick Lowrey impression that starts as lame and ends pretty damn convincing.
C: BURNETT
D: Yo, you are live with Lowrey... Yo, you're live with Lowrey.
E: then into phone
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

E: annoyed
S: INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: But as Burnett enters the house, all he notices are that two DOGS start YAPPING HYSTERICALLY. He can't see her. But she can see him. From behind the door, she comes out swinging a bat. Burnett ducks and Julie smashes the hat stand instead. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM 37A.
C: BURNETT
D: What the fuck was that for?

C: JULIE
D: Wrong. Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off.
C: BURNETT
D: Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It's a man thing. She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly, catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her.
C: BURNETT
D: You know what? You don't wanna believe me? That's fine with me! Go it alone. Burnett heads toward the open door. Julie's veneer drops as she shrinks to the floor.

D: Then lemme introduce myself. I'm Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help you.
C: JULIE
D: You're not what I expected.
C: BURNETT
D: Yeah, well neither are you. You swing like Barry Bonds. Burnett nods and crosses over to help Julie to her feet.

C: JULIE
D: No. Nobody.

D: Wrong?
C: BURNETT
D: I mean right. As in good. My place is good. We'll go there first. My place.
E: confirms
S: EXT. LOWREY'S BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Burnett's Volvo pulls into the circular driveway of Oceanview Terrace.
S: INT. VOLVO - CONTINUOUS ACTION
C: BURNETT
D: Wait here.
S: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
N: Burnett walks over to CHET, the doorman, a shifty little guy who's always got his hand out. He's sitting on a folding chair reading Penthouse Forum.
C: CHET
D: Detective Burnett... Mr. Lowrey is out...
C: BURNETT
D: He told me I could use the place tonight...
C: CHET
D: Didn't mention it to me. Chet holds out his hand. Burnett slips him ten. Chet sneaks a peek over at the car, sees Julie putting on lipstick.
C: CHET
D: Say. How's that Mrs. Burnett? Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough.
C: CHET
D: Your children good? Mr. Lowrey says you got a regular baby factory goin' over there.
C: BURNETT
D: Here. And if that's not enough, I'm gonna run you in for extortion.
E: all his money
C: CHET
D: Now that I think about it, Mr. Lowrey did mention something about giving you the key.
S: INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: The door opens, Burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark for the light switch. Finally finds it.
C: BURNETT
D: I forgot I had those switches moved. Welcome to Casa del Lowrey. Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but impressed by the stylish digs.
C: JULIE
D: Nice... very nice. All this on a cop's salary?
C: BURNETT
D: I uh... I invest.
C: JULIE
D: Right. What was your last pick? A horse in the number two race at Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you an inside tip.
C: CLOSE ON WINE RACK
D: Which Julie runs her hands across labels. All French.
C: BURNETT
D: -- My father invests... Listen. You must be tired --
C: JULIE
D: I'll ask you this only once, Mike. Are you on the take? And if you say no and I discover you're lying to me, I'll walk. Are we clear?
C: BURNETT
D: Fair enough. I'm not on the take. Satisfied? Good. So... why don't you make yourself at home? Here's the T.V. remote. Watch yourself some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or somethin'. Hits "ON" button. Instead of TV, the room immediately becomes a seduction den: lights dim, romantic music.
C: BURNETT
D: Heh -- all these damn things look alike. Well, gotta run... There's probably a couple of good steaks in the fridge for the dogs. Help yourself to whatever. I'll check on you in the morning.
E: switches it off starts to go
C: JULIE
D: Where are you going?
C: BURNETT
D: Uh, back to the P.D. I got paperwork back on my desk to go through that's about this high. And now there's you, so that makes it this high. To his neck.
E: to his armpits
C: JULIE
D: You mean, you're going to leave me alone? In your place. With all your stuff?
C: BURNETT
D: Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief or a vandal?
C: JULIE
D: Of course not. And I'm not a call girl, either.
C: BURNETT
D: I didn't ask.
C: JULIE
D: I know you didn't. I just thought you should know.
C: BURNETT
D: Okay. Important lesson. Julie's not a call girl. Can I go now?
C: JULIE
D: Just one more thing. Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett. It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.
C: JULIE
D: Thank you. For everything.
C: BURNETT
D: Don't mention it. Burnett tries to break toward the door when the PHONE RINGS. Burnett stares at the phone, not knowing what to do.
C: JULIE
D: Aren't you going to --
C: LOWREY'S MACHINE
D: Hi. You're live with Lowrey. Leave it at the beep. The PHONE BEEPS.
E: V.O.
C: YVETTE
D: Miiike... it's Yvette... I know I told you I don't date cops. And I know I told you I wouldn't sleep with a man I wasn't going to marry. But I've been thinking -- and I remember when you said thinking was a dangerous thing -- so I started feeling... well, lonely. Remember when you gave me that key -- Burnett charges over and shuts OFF the MACHINE.
E: V.O.
C: BURNETT
D: It's uh... It's uh...
C: JULIE
D: You don't have to explain. Finally, they've reached consensus. Burnett grins and is out the door.
C: BURNETT
D: Lock the door. Don't open it for anybody.

S: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
N: As Burnett is racing back through to the car, he sees Chet behind the desk and stops.
C: BURNETT
D: Listen, Chet. The girl? She's a witness. I'm gonna be gone for about an hour. Do me a favor. Keep your eye out, okay?
C: CHET
D: You know, Mr. Burnett. I'm getting off in just a few minutes, so... I could watch the door if you like. You know. In a chair. I could just sit in it. Outside the door like cops do when they're guarding shit.
C: BURNETT
D: Just keep an eye out. Heads for the door.
C: CHET
D: Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you know? Just didn't work out. You know? Politics.
S: INT. BURNETT HALLWAY
N: As Doris storms toward her bedroom, Burnett trails her, apologetically --
C: DORIS
D: Don't you 'Honey Baby' me --
C: BURNETT
D: -- I swear, baby, it's nothing. I was on the job -- As she gets to the bedroom, Doris wheels around --
C: DORIS
D: And you just happened to lose your wedding ring -- 'on the job?!' He looks down at his ringless finger --
C: BURNETT
D: No! No! I got it right here...
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 46A. He hastily fishes into his jacket pocket, but too late -- Doris slams the door in his face, LOCKS it. OFF Burnett's pained expression --
S: INT. MIAMI PD - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Burnett and Lowrey on the move.
C: BURNETT
D: If you were a real partner, instead of some no-backup, hot doggin', car chasin', skirt sniffin' motherfucker, I would be gettin' down to business with my wife instead of stuck in this situation.
C: LOWREY
D: Yeah. Thanks for the get-well card.
S: INT. POLICE BASKETBALL GYM
N: Howard is in sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as his morning workout. Parked on either side of the hoop, Lowrey and Burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball and send it back to him.
C: BURNETT
D: Chief. I tried to set the girl up with a sketch artist but she won't. I tried to get her to come in and look at the mug books and she won't come in.
C: HOWARD
D: She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey. He tosses a brick.
C: BURNETT
D: That's right. So let her deal with the real Mike Lowrey! Who, I might add, shoulda been there to take the call instead of runnin' off like a hot dog without any backup. Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.
C: LOWREY
D: Hey. I'm not the one who left a strange hooker alone in my apartment. You know, she's probably on the street sellin' all my shit as we speak.
C: BURNETT
D: I had to stash her somewhere! She's scared shitless... just like her dogs.
C: LOWREY
D: Dogs, too? I got Persian rugs, man. I'm going home... explain the whole thing, take her to the Motel Six, she'll understand...
C: HOWARD
D: Not a good idea. Until she I.D.s the shotters, he's Mike Lowrey. Could take a coupla hours. Could take all day. You got a computer with a modem?
E: brick
C: BURNETT
D: Big computer. Expensive --
C: LOWREY
D: Yeah, I got a computer and you shouldn't touch it. It took me weeks to get it set up the way I want it and I don't want amateurs messing with it.
C: HOWARD
D: Burnett. I'll have Francine give you the user code for the computer files and you can run pictures for the girl on Lowrey's super duper computer.
E: brick number four
C: BURNETT
D: So what about me? I can't tell my wife I'm shacked up with a female witness! Besides, I think they made my car last night... I gotta stay close to home, just in case.
C: HOWARD
D: Easy. Lowrey moves into your house. And you're on special assignment. Another brick.
C: LOWREY
D: No way! I'm not living in that zoo.
C: BURNETT
D: My house ain't no zoo!
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 49.
C: HOWARD
D: Enough! You're him, he's you! Until she makes the shooters and we get the dope back, I don't care what you have to do, just make it work! Lowrey and Burnett feel hammered by Howard. Upon retrieving his final brick, Lowrey passes to Burnett, who feeds back Lowrey with a heel kick to the rim. And Lowrey slams the ball home. They exit with Howard simply staring.
S: INT. BURNETT BEDROOM - DAY
N: Burnett's tossing some things into an overnight bag. Theresa watches him, concerned.
C: THERESA
D: You never had to go to Cleveland on police business before.
C: BURNETT
D: Cleveland's where they collared the dealer. And that's where I gotta go to testify.
C: THERESA
D: But what about us? The neighborhood's had all break-ins. I won't feel safe if you're --
C: BURNETT
D: Honey. I wouldn't go if I didn't have the most trustworthy man I know to look after my family...
C: THERESA
D: Oh, no, Not Lowrey. Not in my house.
C: BURNETT
D: Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my life and, I most certainly trust him with yours.
C: THERESA
D: Why don't they send him to Cleveland?
C: BURNETT
D: Baby. It's a Federal subpoena. I'm the witness. I'm the one who has to testify. Case closed. I'm the one going to Cleveland. Lowrey's staying here.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 50.
S: EXT. BURNETT HOUSE
N: Theresa stands at the door with arms crossed. Meanwhile, Burnett throws his bag in the trunk of the Porsche. He and Lowrey trade car keys, the Porsche for the Volvo.
C: BURNETT
D: Don't forget to put Snail Guard on my lawn.
C: LOWREY
D: Just leave Cleveland the way you found it. Burnett climbs in, waves out the window.
C: BURNETT
D: Bye-bye, Theresa. Be good, kids. Lowrey joins Theresa on the porch. Mockingly he puts his arm around her and waves.
C: THERESA
D: Why's he taking your car?
C: LOWREY
D: He's dropping it off at the mechanic on the way to the airport. The engine needs an overhaul... or will by the time he gets there. The Porsche heads down the block with a GRINDING of GEARS. Lowrey winces and heads for the Volvo when Theresa gets in his way.
E: seething
C: THERESA
D: Where you think you're going? I got a list here of things that Marcus was supposed --
C: LOWREY
D: -- that Marcus was supposed to do. That's right. Marcus. Not Mike. 'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with no time to waste. Lowrey's in the Volvo and pulling away as fast as he can.

Huge, bakery-sized mixing BOWLS CHUG on one side of the room while lab workers form the doughy, cut heroin into pizza-sized forms, and shovel them into tractor ovens on the other side of the room.

C: ON FOUCHET
D: He's dealing with his 26-year-old chemist named ELLIOT.
C: FOUCHET
D: Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot. Why are we behind?
C: ELLIOT
D: The cutting agent is highly volatile. You can't cook it like you would a pizza. I had to gear the ovens down to half-speed.
C: FOUCHET
D: We already accounted for that, Elliot. It's in our fucking timetable. So what else?
N: Elliot is uncomfortable. He looks back at WALLY, his stoned-looking assistant, before forging ahead.
C: ELLIOT
D: There's too much moisture down here. The pies are taking longer to cook than we originally planned.
C: WALLY
D: Yeah. It's totally fucked.
C: FOUCHET
D: You. Shut up. Now, listen, you little pussy. We're not making pizza.
E: back to Elliot MORE

D: Yeah. It's me. Mike.
E: O.S.
C: JULIE
D: At least your timing's good. Can you bring me the lotion on the nightstand? Burnett enters. Julie has a towel wrapped around her body.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM 52A.
C: JULIE
D: Thanks. So I was thinking... Julie, obviously free with her body, suddenly drops the towel and starts applying lotion. Burnett averts his eyes, turning around a full one-eighty, but finds himself facing a mirror. Oops. Looks left, another shiny surface. Shit.
C: BURNETT
D: Crazy fuckin' woman. He steps from the bathroom and stands outside the door.
E: to himself
C: JULIE
D: The guy who killed Max. Now, he was looking for the heroin that Eddie stole from him... Max went to the party as a favor to you. You're a dope cop, right?
C: BURNETT
D: Special Narcotics Division.
C: JULIE
D: So this isn't about Max's death at all. It's about dope.

E: O.S.
S: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Burnett exits the closet to find Julie brushing out her wet hair, wearing nothing but what she described, a T- shirt and pair of Lowrey's boxers tied up with a shoe string. This ensemble never looked so good.
C: BURNETT
D: Mug shots. We got mug shots to look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook into the P.D. computer. He heads out of the bedroom.
C: JULIE
D: Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all the pictures? Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of Lowrey. All ego.
C: BURNETT
D: That guy? Well, that's Marcus Burnett, my partner. Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty frame, too.
C: BURNETT
D: There's the two of us, see? Me'n'... ... My partner.
E: gestures to photos
C: JULIE
D: Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta guys. And I've seen a good number of their bedrooms, okay? But I've never seen... I mean, look at it. It's like a shrine to him.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM 54.
C: BURNETT
D: Yeah. Okay. Sure, I can see how it looks that way... But you see... you see... It's uh... a cop thing. That's because I've put a picture up there for every time Marcus has saved my life.
E: then it comes
C: JULIE
D: Saved your life?
C: BURNETT
D: I save his life. He saves mine. He's got the same thing in his house. Pictures of me. More, even. Good family man, that Marcus.
C: JULIE
D: Okay, but Mike. This is like a lot of pictures. I mean, this isn't something by the bedstand. This is a whole wall... And I know Max said you were just friends. That's why I was thinking, maybe... you could be... gay. Burnett reacts, then recovers with...
C: BURNETT
D: Me? Gay? Are you outta your mind?
C: JULIE
D: I didn't mean to offend you.
C: BURNETT
D: It's a good thing that I'm secure in my manhood to see that you don't mean that. You know how many women I've had in that waterbed? Check the waves as they go by. Count 'em. Now, mug shots?
E: turns back to living room
S: INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: Burnett and Julie are sitting at the computer looking at mug shots dialed in from the police database. She fiddles with, but does not eat her salad, while stealing sideways glances from the computer screen to the nasty, bologna sandwich Burnett is eating.
C: BURNETT
D: The shooter said four days until he makes the deal. What else did he say?
C: JULIE
D: Somethin' weird. Sounded like three angels... He wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something. I didn't get the rest. I'm getting tired of looking at ugly people.
E: back to the mug shots
C: BURNETT
D: Just a few more and we can take another break.
C: JULIE
D: I don't wanna take a break. Then we'd have to talk and I got nothing to say to a cannibal.
C: BURNETT
D: A what?
C: JULIE
D: That was a living, breathing consciousness. It felt joy. Sadness. Maybe it even had a name.
C: BURNETT
D: What had a name.
C: JULIE
D: That flesh you're shoveling into your mouth.
C: BURNETT
D: It's just bologna.
E: stops chewing
C: JULIE
D: It was alive. Some farmer fed it. Got it to trust him. Then blew its brains out, dumped it in a cement mixer with a ton of carcinogens and now you're eating it.
N: Burnett never looked at it that way. He starts to put it down.
C: JULIE
D: No. At least finish it so I won't have to look at it. Let's look at some more ugly people.
E: back to the screen
N: ANGLE - COMPUTER SCREEN It's a photo of Noah along with his extensive rap sheet.

C: BURNETT
D: Your dog took a shit.
C: JULIE
D: And you used Pledge to clean it up?
C: BURNETT
D: Lemon Pledge.
E: looks at can
C: JULIE
D: Well, that makes a big difference. You just varnished that into the fabric. I'm sure it works great. Burnett doesn't quite know what to do with the wad of dog poop in paper towels still in his hand. Julie snatches it from him and heads for the bathroom. Burnett follows. He suddenly realizes that the clean clothes are his.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 58.
C: BURNETT
D: You cleaned my clothes?
C: JULIE
D: I just threw them in with mine.

D: I had a little accident.
E: shyly
C: BURNETT
D: This is my favorite shirt. My lucky shirt.

C: BURNETT
D: Not going to happen.

D: I need apparel. That and I need some food that's something more than a cold, slab of fear.

D: If you were my wife I'd drink it.

D: Twelve years I'm married, Michael. And I never let Marcus bring his work home.
C: LOWREY
D: Just a harmless bedtime story. Thought the kids deserved to know about the hero they have for a dad.
C: THERESA
D: We don't need any violence in this household and we certainly don't need any more heroes. What we need is a father and a husband.
C: LOWREY
D: Husband? Theresa. He's your personal errand boy. You beep the poor S.O.B. every hour on the Goddamn hour? And why is it always about some useless bullshit that can wait until later. I mean, the guy's gotta job to do.
C: THERESA
D: You wanna know why I page him? Because until that phone rings, I don't know whether he's dead or alive. And lemme tell you. Those three minutes I'm waiting for him to call back? Those are the hardest three minutes for a cop's wife.

D: You know, this is like some really bizarre shit that you're on right now. Your wife asked me to do this, and I'm doin' it. Besides, I'm you, remember?
C: BURNETT
D: You don't even know where you're going. You're in the wrong aisle. Lowrey follows Burnett to the next aisle, where Burnett gestures to the wall of feminine hygiene products.
C: BURNETT
D: You think you know what Theresa needs, man, but I do this every month. Just look for 'Fresh Days.' Lowrey moves ahead. There's too much to look at.
E: challenges
C: LOWREY
D: You're unbalanced. Listen, I read the parole jacket on this guy Noah. Armed robbery. Attempted murder. He's a violent offender somethin' like nine times. Sweet guy. Not a single drug bust on his sheet.
C: BURNETT
D: So? He's a new recruit. Keep looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.'
C: LOWREY
D: You know, it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff.

C: BURNETT
D: That's a whole 'nother category of thing! Man, for a guy that spends all his time chasing pussy, you sure don't know much about the woo woo. Here it is. Fresh Days. You pay for it.

S: EXT. GRUNGY TRAILER PARK - DAY
N: Burnett and Lowrey park and pop the trunk. Inside are guns and uniforms.

C: LOWREY
D: Water and Power.
S: EXT. TRAILER - DAY
N: Approaching are Burnett and Lowrey, but now they're dressed in shorts and T-shirts with bright orange vests and caps reading "Water and Power." And as Lowrey knocks on the door. CLOSE ON HEAVY LINK CHAIN Wrapped around a pink refrigerator. It moves.
C: BURNETT
D: What do you think the chain's for?
C: LOWREY
D: I dunno. Maybe some kind of hurricane anchor. They knock again. The chain jerks slightly.
C: BURNETT
D: Well, the anchor just moved. Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first, it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at the deck. The door swings open. Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.
S: INT. TRAILER - DAY
N: Lowrey and Burnett are holding the door against the GROWLING LION. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94 64.

E: O.S.
C: BURNETT
D: AAAAAAAAAAA-Animal Control!
C: WOMAN
D: But your uniforms say Water and Power!
C: LOWREY
D: We're undercover! Now, we're lookin' for the owner of that animal.
C: WOMAN
D: Listen. The cat don't belong to me. It belong to my brother. And I don't know where he is.
C: BURNETT
D: That's too bad. Because his lion's tied to your trailer. So you gotta move the beast. Or move the trailer.
C: WOMAN
D: Move the trailer? Move it to where?
C: LOWREY
D: Everglades. Only part of South Florida that's zoned for Wild Kingdom shit. 'Course, the crocks down there'll probably eat your brother's cat.
C: WOMAN
D: But he loves that lion! Raised him from a little kitty!

C: LOWREY
D: What's that on the rug? Looks like... a stain? Teeth grit.
C: JULIE
D: It was my babies, Luke and Duke. They get nervous in new surroundings. I offered to pay for the cleaning, but Mike wouldn't hear of it -- Lowrey spots rings from glasses on the table.
C: LOWREY
D: And have you ever heard of a new invention called the 'coaster'? As he tries buffing the table with his sleeve.
C: CLOSE ON JULIE
D: She might be catching on here.
C: JULIE
D: Marcus, you act like it's your place.
C: BURNETT
D: What?
C: LOWREY
D: No. It's not my place. My wife. She's a designer. She decorated the whole place at a discount just for Mike. And when she hears about how he's been taking care of -- Off the couch!

D: Mike? The Woman strips off the overcoat -- under which she's breathtakingly naked, save for a garter belt and stockings. She drapes the coat over the nearest chair.
C: WOMAN
D: I'm feeling really nasty right now.
N: Burnett is first to appear from the bedroom -- and his expression goes off the charts. Startled, the woman shrugs back into her coat.
C: WOMAN
D: Who the hell are you? Burnett charges her, instantly ushering her to the door.
C: BURNETT
D: How did you get in here? Julie and Lowrey return from the bedroom.
C: WOMAN
D: I have a key. But, Mike...

D: Maybe you should call first next time. What's your name?
E: whispers
C: WOMAN
D: Yvette!
C: BURNETT
D: You don't quit stalking me, Yvette, I'm gonna place your ass under arrest! -- 'Bye! Burnett slams the door. She's SCREAMING on the other side, POUNDING the door with her fists, and cursing in mad Spanish. Finally she stomps off down the hall.
C: LOWREY
D: 'The hell's going on out here??
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 67.
C: BURNETT
D: Just that crazy Yvette, stalking me again. Lowrey could kill.

D: That woman's into some weird shit. Julie's confused, to say the least.
C: JULIE
D: So, Mike. Any other spontaneous naked women with keys, that we should know about?
E: to Burnett
C: BURNETT
D: We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club Hell. We're gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max's shooter. Anyone got a problem with that?
C: JULIE
D: I feel safer now. She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door- way and gets into his face.

D: You are ruining my life!

S: INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and sits back down at the computer. She plays with the keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death replaying itself in her mind. Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and exits.

N: And, believe it or not, the other side of the fishtank behind the bar. Burnett's at the urinal, blissfully relieving himself when Casper appears at his side. There's that awkward men-don't-talk-at-the-urinal moment until Burnett leans over...
C: BURNETT
D: Oh, man. Budweiser...
C: CASPER
D: Excuse me?
C: BURNETT
D: Musta drank about a million Budweisers tonight, waitin' for my ol' friend Noah to show. Wouldn't know him, would ya? Guy practically raised me up from nothin'.

S: INT. MEN'S ROOM
N: Burnett rips the bag off his head, reaches for his gun. But Casper's there, lunging into him and lifting him up and into the fishtank.
S: INT. BAR - LOWREY
N: He's been watching the fish in the tank, but turns back toward the bar just at the moment of Burnett's impact. The tank cracks on the bathroom side and water begins draining, unbeknownst to Lowrey.
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - BURNETT AND CASPER
N: Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea- weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late. Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett picks up his gun. BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 72.

N: Lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa, the back of which faces the window. Exhausted, he turns off light and closes his eyes. A beat. Burnett's face pops up furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass, looking for evidence of adultery. He can't see Lowrey asleep on the couch.

D: Okay. What are we doing about it?
C: LOWREY
D: We're doing nothing. I've got it handled. In the meantime, you better get back to where you belong before I shoot you myself.

C: CHET
D: 'Evening, Mr. Lowrey. May I have a word with you? I was thinking that... maybe I could see your gun. See, we don't allow guns up in the apartments. Mr. Lowrey usually checks his, here, at the desk with me... You want me to check yours? Burnett pulls his gun. But doesn't hand it to Chet. He sticks it in Chet's face.

N: Burnett stands over the Henchman and lifts his defeated chin to face him. Burnett has it in him to give the guy one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised face proves punishment enough.

D: Yeah. I guess you're tellin' the truth.

D: I also got the lab report from the stuff you picked up in Noah's trunk. He hands it off.

N: Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey. Each is clearly tired of the other. The silence is deadly until Julie breaks the silence.
C: JULIE
D: So where's the coffee and donuts?
C: BURNETT
D: What?
C: JULIE
D: I thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout. A little caffeine for the heart. Some sugar-coated dough fried in day old grease.
C: LOWREY
D: Man. Will you get off this? You're making me sick.
C: JULIE
D: Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All these hours on the case, you must miss Theresa's home cooking. Bet last night she fixed you up something yummy and left it in the microwave for you. Burnett starts to steam.

D: Yeah. Somethin' yummy.
C: JULIE
D: I imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed --
C: BURNETT
D: Listen, lady -- But Burnett's face ignites with headlights at their rear. Doors open. Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror. He sees two private security cops named DE SOUZA and TOWNE. They split and approach either side of the unmarked sedan.
E: wheels
C: LOWREY
D: Oh, man. It's the fuckin' pretend police.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 92.
C: BURNETT
D: Be nice. After tomorrow we might need 'em for a job reference. Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...
C: TOWNE
D: Well, what do we have back here? Looks like we got us two pimps and a hooker.
C: DE SOUZA
D: Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does us both we'll let you leave with your pride intact.
C: LOWREY
D: Excuse me. One moment. Let's fuck with these bozos. Burnett nods his approval. Lowrey lowers the window.
E: rolls up the window
C: LOWREY
D: Now, where were we?
C: TOWNE
D: Outta the car. Hands where we can see 'em. Feet spread. Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking Burnett's shoulders.
C: BURNETT
D: Oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker. You gotta start at the waistband. See if he's carrying a piece. Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to Burnett's waistband where he feels a --
C: TOWNE
D: Gun! Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.
N: BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 93.
C: LOWREY
D: Whoah. You better watch it, fellahs! You know, it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and a call girl... But it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and their witness on a stakeout. Looks pass between the hobby cops.
E: very slowly
C: LOWREY
D: Now I'm reaching slowly for my shield... very slowly... here it comes... just about got it... Ooh, look at that. It's a detective's shield! All gold and shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't fuck with somebody who had one of these in his pocket. So... Let's see. I guess that makes us policemen. And you...
E: slowly turns reveals his badge
C: BURNETT
D: Not. He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns, unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.
C: BURNETT
D: Now, some rent-a-cops have licenses to carry weapons, where others do not. Which might you be? You wouldn't happen to have those permits handy, would you? From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see that they don't.
C: JULIE
D: Guess we know the answer to that one.

N: Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the other.
S: INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY
N: MUZAK. Old ladies getting their hair blued and curled when -- BANG! Fouchet and the gang enter. Curlers fly. Screams!
C: LOWREY
D: enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES. BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey ends up under an old lady's dress.
S: EXT. OCEAN BLVD. (SOUTH BEACH)
N: Exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling their way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments behind, pushing his way through the same path.
S: EXT. INTERSECTION
N: Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before. He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.
S: EXT. INTERSECTION
N: But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.
C: INSIDE CAB
D: Ferguson aims his pistol upward. He's about to fire into the roof when Julie shoves him. GUNSHOTS RING out sideways.
S: EXT./INT. CAB
N: BULLETS RIP to either side of Burnett. Then Fouchet stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and onto the pavement.
C: CLOSE ON BURNETT
D: He rolls, makes it to one knee. But his other leg gives way.
C: FOUCHET
D: He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The cab barrels at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard, about to become instant roadkill. Then --
S: EXT. STREET
N: From out of nowhere, here comes Lowrey. Dashing out across the boulevard and snatching his partner from the deadly grille of the cab.
C: TAXI CAB
D: hauls on by. Leaving Burnett and Lowrey in a heap of their own, both trying to catch their breath.
C: LOWREY
D: Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.
S: EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - DAY
N: TAC teams and uniform cops swarm around their cars. All waiting as Burnett and Lowrey arrive in their unmarked car. Howard approaches.
C: HOWARD
D: It's about fuckin' time.
C: BURNETT
D: We lost the girl.
C: HOWARD
D: But you found the dope, right? So let's go get it back. A bicycle BELL RINGS. Heads turn. And here comes a BOY on his bike, serpentining his way through the maze of cars and cops until he gets to Lowrey, Burnett, and Howard.
C: BOY
D: Which one of you's Lowrey? I got somethin' for him.
C: LOWREY
D: At least I'm me again. I'm Lowrey. From his back pocket, the boy extracts a cellular flip PHONE. He hands it to Lowrey. He presses the power button and, almost instantly, it RINGS.
E: hand out
C: LOWREY
D: Yeah. This is Lowrey.
E: presses send
S: INT. FREIGHTER - DOPE LAB - DAY
N: While dope is lifted and loaded from the open hold, Fouchet is revealed at the other end of the cellular call.

S: EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - LOWREY
N: He jolts at the sound of GUNFIRE.
S: INT. FREIGHTER - DOPE LAB - FOUCHET
N: Where the CAMERA SWISH PANS ACROSS TO a very dead Elliot.
C: FOUCHET
D: That bullet just killed the chemist. Now, I have but four hours left to make my deal. Fuck with my timetable and the next bullet kills the girl. Julie is gagged and sitting on the floor, scared shitless.
S: EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - LOWREY
N: He's in a vice. Duty or the girl. Then --
C: LOWREY
D: You twisted motherfucker... Jojo, you sonofabitch. When I get my hands on you, I swear, I'm gonna kill you. The snitch who tipped us to the dope lab? Turns out to be a bogus address.
E: then... hangs up
C: BURNETT
D: Bogus address?
C: HOWARD
D: How's this? I'll kill the little prick for you. That's cuz you're already dead. Okay, you guys. Put 'em back in the lockers.
E: waves at the troops
N: En masse, all the cops act as if the wind had been knocked from their sails.
S: INT. LOW-DOWN BAR - DAY
N: Empty, save for the daytime regulars at the bar and Burnett and Lowrey in a rear booth.
C: BURNETT
D: How'd he know we were gearing up to go? It's like he's known all along where we're gonna be and when.
C: LOWREY
D: You know that once he sells the dope, he's gonna kill her just like he did Max.
C: BURNETT
D: Three little angels. Julie kept talking about his three little angels. A barkeeper appears with two beers. Burnett automati- cally reaches for his wallet.
C: CLOSE ON BURNETT'S WALLET
D: Where out pops a picture of his three children.
C: LOWREY
D: If she dies, I'm done with it. The whole cop thing.
C: BURNETT
D: Three little angels.
E: looking at his kids
S: INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY
N: Francine is at her file desk. Looking pretty much the same as always. Same smile. Same easy manner. Then the CAMERA REVOLVES AROUND her and SETTLES ON those pictures on her desk. Her three little boys -- including the one in uniform. The CAMERA TILTS TO --
C: LOWREY AND BURNETT
D: standing over her desk.
N: Neither of them smiling.
C: FRANCINE
D: Hey, fellahs. What's the joke. Really. I want to know. Soon, though, the facade fades. Francine knows she's been caught.
E: as she gets nothing back
S: INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY
N: Burnett holds the door while Lowrey holds Francine. She's broken, crying, and giving up the ghost of her past.
C: FRANCINE
D: It was a birthday party... You know, after hours. Just the civilian staff... We were drinking. And everybody. They all had boy friends or their husbands.
C: LOWREY
D: So you were alone?
C: FRANCINE
D: He was so nice to me. He said I was beautiful, too. I guess I wanted to believe him... He took some horrible pictures of me. I don't remember any of it. I'd had too much to drink. I wondered if he'd drugged me. Later... he threatened to show them to my boys... my little angels. Said he'd pin the pictures up on the grade school bulletin boards for all their classmates to see if I didn't do what he wanted.
E: then ashamed, starting to shake
C: BURNETT
D: He wanted someone inside the P.D.?
C: FRANCINE
D: At first, it was about drug busts. Dealers under surveillance.
E: MORE
C: FRANCINE
D: He'd steal from them before we could make the case. And then when the department gave the air conditioning to Mr. Orona...
E: CONT'D
C: BURNETT
D: Anything you can tell us about him?
C: FRANCINE
D: What do you say about someone who rips off drug dealers? A man like that ain't scared of nobody. Not the police. Not you guys. Nobody. He's the scariest man I ever met.
E: beat
C: LOWREY
D: Yeah. But does he still trust what you tell him?

C: FOUCHET
D: Yes, Francine... What is it?
C: FRANCINE

D: Is that all?
C: FRANCINE
D: Yes.
C: FOUCHET
D: I'm very pleased, Francine. You're the best pet I've ever had. He hangs up.

S: INT. FORWARD TRUCK - FOUCHET
N: The CAMERA ZEROES IN ON his cellular phone. The power light is green.

S: EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY
N: Two henchmen for the buyer open the yawning doors of this massive, five-story hangar to reveal a C-123 cargo aircraft. The convoy of trucks enters.

S: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY
N: THROUGH a floor-mounted SPOTTING SCOPE we see the last of the trucks roll into Hangar 3 and two of the buyer's henchmen shut the doors.
C: BURNETT
D: That's it. That's where they're making the deal. Burnett swivels the spotting scope.
S: EXT. ORANGE CITY AIRFIELD - SCOPE'S POV
N: PANNING LEFT AND RIGHT ACROSS the landscape of tall reeds and distant buildings. Finally he STALLS ON a garbage truck and its four-man crew rolling dumpsters.
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - DAY
N: Fouchet shakes hands with the BUYER. Upon which time one forklift begins to drive pallets full of cash from the open cargo door of the aircraft while another drives pallets full of dope.
C: BUYER
D: Three hundred million and very, very fresh. Too much to count, eh?
C: ON JULIE
D: As Casper pulls her from the rear of a truck and handcuffs her to the door of a cab.
C: BUYER
D: Who's the bimbo?
C: FOUCHET
D: Simply part of another transaction.
N: The operation moves swiftly. Dope pallets for cash pallets. Smooth, just like the original heist. Two fuel trucks are moved in to gas up the aircraft.
S: EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
N: Rounding the corner from Hangar 3 -- here comes the garbage truck. CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS Ruiz and Sanchez at the helm with both Lowrey and Burnett hanging from the sides. All of them wear dirty white jumpsuits and protective masks.
S: EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY
N: The two Buyer's henchmen stiffen at the sight of the oncoming truck. Their hands slip inside their coats to MP5-Ks slung under their armpits. But --
S: EXT. HANGAR 3 - GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY
N: It veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters. With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and dumped into the truck.
C: CLOSE ON DUMPSTER
D: As it lowers, the gearing seems to get hung up. The hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck in the air.
C: RUIZ AND SANCHEZ
D: Begin speaking Spanish, one blaming the other for this fiasco. Angry words. Finally, Ruiz has had enough. He tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off as if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right for the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving and spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing what to think. Ready for anything when -- CLICK CLICK -- GUNS COCKING. Both Burnett and Lowrey are right behind the henchmen with guns at the base of their necks.
C: BURNETT
D: Mouths shut, feet moving. Now, walk.
S: EXT. HANGAR #3 - ANGLE ON DUMPSTER

S: INT. HANGAR 3 - TRUCK ENGINES
N: START. Loaded with cash, they're ready to go. Fouchet gives the signal to open the doors.
C: CASPER AND FERGUSON
D: Move to open the doors. They give a good shove. Still nothing. So they bang and shout.
C: CASPER
D: Hey! Wake up out there! Open it up!
S: EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY
N: One of the dumpsters is parked in front of the doors. No exit.
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - DAY
N: Just as Casper and Ferguson give a helpless look to Fouchet...
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - ANGLE ACROSS HANGAR - DAY
N: The garbage truck barrels through the rear wall, instantly colliding with the left wing section of aircraft. The wheel assembly buckles and the aircraft twists onto one wing. Fuel spills.

D: charge. GUNS BLASTING.
N: BULLETS RIP across the dumpster, moving up into the truck cab. Ruiz and Sanchez dive and roll to either side. Meanwhile, the sparks ignite the spilled fuel.
C: LOWREY
D: Move it or lose it! Burnett and Lowrey climb from the dumpster and run. Casper and Ferguson have a clear shot. They level and aim, but...
C: KUH-WHOOM!
D: The FUEL TANK on the aircraft EXPLODES. The truck drivers dive for cover. Charging for the open hole in the wall.
S: INT. AIRCRAFT (HANGAR 3)
N: Inside the aircraft the precious dope catches fire.
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - ON CASPER AND FERGUSON
N: Looking through the flames. Shielding their eyes. Ruiz and Sanchez appear from behind.
C: SANCHEZ
D: Remember us? The two bad guys turn with their guns. The flames igniting their already battered faces. But they don't turn fast enough. Both cops FIRE in unison. Ferguson and Casper fall. PULL BACK --
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - WIDE ANGLE
N: One aircraft ENGINE still ROARING. The money swirling and burning, falling from the roof like a fiery rain. And --
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - LOWREY AND BURNETT

D: Michael! Her VOICE ECHOES.
E: O.S.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - FOUCHET
N: He's handcuffed himself to Julie, dragging her deeper and deeper into the hangar. The smoke is getting thicker and swirling with the burning cash.
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - BURNETT AND LOWREY
N: Signals between the two. They split wider. Moving toward those locked doors.
S: INT. HANGAR 3 - BACK ON FOUCHET
N: At the locked doors. He shoves against them in a futile rage. Julie begins to choke on the fumes.

S: INT. HANGAR - DOORS - FOUCHET
N: Shoving the doors. Pushing and pushing. Then -- FROM HAIL OF SMOKE AND BURNING CASH Appear Lowrey and Burnett. Twenty yards apart and closing. Guns carefully aimed. Fouchet pulls Julie close.
C: FOUCHET
D: I was going to fuck her, then kill her. Now it looks like I'm only going to do the latter.
C: LOWREY
D: Either we O.D. on the air or the whole place blows. We're dying anyway.
C: BURNETT
D: Let her go and you'll walk. You can keep the dope and the money. Just the girl and we all get out of here.
E: coughs
C: FOUCHET
D: What if I don't have the key.
C: JULIE
D: He threw it in the --
C: FOUCHET
D: Shut up! It's gone. She's dead. Unless you move aside. Burnett eases further right. Gun carefully aimed. His eyes are stinging. Lowrey goes left. But he's lowering his gun.
E: yanks her
C: FOUCHET
D: Pulls Julie closer. Gun at her head. Looking to Burnett. While Lowrey is nodding to Julie. Nodding for her to --
C: LOWREY
D: Drop, Julie! She drops. Burnett has a clear shot when --
C: HANGAR DOORS
D: Swing wide and way, way open. Blinding light. NOISE. HELICOPTERS. And about fifty cops at the ready. Rounds chambered. Rifles leveled.
N: QUICK SHOTS Fouchet, Julie, Lowrey, Burnett. All with the same idea. They bolt for daylight as fast as they can go because --
C: HANGAR
