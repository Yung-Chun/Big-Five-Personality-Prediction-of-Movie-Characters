S: INT. WASHINGTON, DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
N: We're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 SIX YEAR OLDS. All sitting on the floor, legs crossed. Sitting in front of the kids is Little KEVIN FLEURY, flanked by his mom LYLA FLEURY and his dad RONALD FLEURY, in a dark suit. Little Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling the class about the photos. We're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TIGHT ON Fleury.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: This is my Fredricksburg house and my grandma Ruth playing with my skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk jump ramp.
N: A little girl, MICK raises her hand.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Mick?
E: CONT'D
N: Silence from Mick
C: MICK
D: I forgot what I was going to say.
N: Kevin points to another picture.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: This is me at my second birthday party with my mom and my dad. That's my cake.
N: Fleury looks down sweet at his son.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: This is me with my mom at the zoo and this is my dad and me and my grandpa Willie.
E: CONT'D
N: Kevin points to another photo.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: And this is me and my dad and my grandpa Willie at my dad's office.
E: CONT'D
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 2. The kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get closer to the pictures. MISS ROSS, the pretty twenty five year old teacher watches from the side.
C: MICK
D: Where's your gun?
C: LITTLE BOY
D: Yeah, where is your gun?
N: Pretty much all the kids get in on this now. Everyone wants to see Fleury's gun. Fleury makes eyes at Miss Ross. She's giving him a `no fucking way' hard eye.
C: FLEURY
D: I'm assuming that there are no bad guys in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad guys?
C: THE WHOLE CLASS
D: GOOD GUYS!
C: FLEURY
D: Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys?
N: This silences the class. Miss Ross keeps things moving, pointing to a photo.
C: MISS ROSS
D: What's that picture?
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: This is me and my dad playing Battleship at my dad's apartment.
N: Mick's hand goes back up.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Mick?
E: CONT'D
C: MICK
D: What is a battleship?
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: My parents are divorced.
E: abruptly
N: A beat. Lyla and Ron look down at Kevin, stalled... KINGDOM 8/18/06 3.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: But that's OK `cause the most important thing is to know that everybody loves each other.
E: CONT'D
N: This hits a bit hard on Lyla and Ron. Miss Ross jumps in.
C: MISS ROSS
D: So, who's that in that picture up on top?
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: That's my fish, his name is Jaws and he's a really mean fish.

S: INT. WASHINGTON DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
N: Kevin's pointing to a picture of Ronald holding him as a tiny newborn.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: This is the day that my daddy says is the happiest day of his life.
C: MISS ROSS
D: Really. His happiest day! Can you tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury?
N: Fleury smiles, looks out at the class. KINGDOM 8/18/06 4.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK...he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well,
N: Fleury stops, checks in with Miss Ross.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Can I tell this story?
E: CONT'D
C: MISS ROSS
D: Go for it.
N: RONALD Fleury So they take her and put her on a special bed and they give her some medicine so she doesn't feel any pain then they take out this tiny little knife and make a tiny little cut right here in her tummy. The kids are mesmerized...
C: MISS ROSS
D: Then what happened?
N: RONALD Fleury Then the doctor put her hands way up into Kevin's mom's tummy. WAY IN! And then you know what they did? A little girl, LU LU: WIDE EYED
C: LU LU
D: What did they do?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: They started to pull and pull and pull... they had something in there and it started coming and they were pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said "STOP!"
N: The class is frozen. Fleury has them. KINGDOM 8/18/06 5.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: They stopped pulling and the doctor looked up at me and said `Hey, Mr. Fleury - you ready to have your world rocked?' And I just stared at her and she pulled this little head up out of that belly. And it was him. His head. And I looked down at him and screamed "Kevin!!" And he looked down at me and screamed "Daddy!!"
E: CONT'D
N: The kids are howling!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. AN UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - LATE DAY
N: A Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented- canopy: 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick, and his 8 and 15 year-old SONS. The 8yo leans his weight into an old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There is no God but Allah. The Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision, most of which we can see from this high up. The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal monolithic shapes made more so by the heat. Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now... Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage. KINGDOM 8/18/06 6.
S: EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - LATE DAY
N: Sounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the walls. Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift- gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through. SERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom of the Rover. A brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID:
C: DRIVER
D: How are you today, Sergeant?
C: HAYTHAM
D: Sun is shining. Wind is blowing. How bad can I be doing?
C: DRIVER
D: I like that, "Sun is shining..."
N: A tight smile from Haytham. The other Officers are checking the inside of the Rover now. They nod to Haytham, Haytham hands the ID back to her. Windows rolls up. Lift-gate goes up. Range Rover pulls away, navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers.
S: INT. COMPOUND - NEXT MOMENT
N: Stay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the complex. Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks, concrete and rock where grass should be. The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security. Official markings, emergency lights in the grill. KINGDOM 8/18/06 7.
S: EXT. UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - SAME MOMENT
N: The Son studies the compound through binoculars, while the youngest Grandson squints to study the softball game: Interest cut with jealousy. More muted cheers float. Behind and above him, his Grandfather's voice, rough as sand, to his 32 year-old Son, in Arabic:
C: GRANDFATHER
D: Hang up the phone. If they're not ready now, no words will change it.
E: O.C.
S: EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - NEXT MOMENT
N: Another Middle-Eastern POLICEMAN takes in the motley competition: half-smiling, half-smirking at a plump-pink White Man cheering on his plump-pink 9 year-old Son sliding into third.
C: WHITE MAN
D: GET DIRTY!
N: Safe. Clapping and Hoots. The PITCHER: an older White Man in his middle forties visibly frustrated. A 25 year-old African- American Batter steps to the plate now. Pitcher turns to his Fielders:
C: PITCHER STEP IT UP NOW!
D: Ready for my knuckle-curve?
E: back the Batter
N: The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high- lob. Batter smacks the ball a mile high, deep to left. The teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third:
C: TEAMMATES
D: TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT-
C: PITCHER
D: -COMIN' HOME!
E: spins, points up at the ball
N: A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball: sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it. We pick up different families on the grass nearby: A young WOMAN helps her five year old DAUGHTER untangle a yo-yo. A black COUPLE doing a crossword puzzle together, the wife's head on her husband's lap. KINGDOM 8/18/06 8.
S: EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
N: The muted reaction to the dropped ball. The whole Family, save the youngest Grandson, intently focused on two Officers walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle of the road, well inside the compound: no blinks now. The youngest still enthralled by the softball game, the cheers, the running, the shorts and t-shirts. We see his Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see what's about to happen. In Arabic:
C: GRANDFATHER
D: Don't stop watching the game.
S: EXT. INSIDE THE COMPOUND WALLS - NEXT MOMENT
N: Noises from the softball game close again. Track these two Officers on foot walking toward the Police Land Cruiser ala shift change: nonchalant but quick.
S: INT. POLICE LAND CRUISER - SAME MOMENT
N: The Driver eyeing the two approaching Officers: something off about them. Uniforms wrinkled, one with a full beard. Driver turns to his Partner, in Arabic:
C: DRIVER
D: You have a copy of the duty rost-
N: -POP-POP-POP before the Driver finishes. The Officers on foot rapid-firing 9MM pistols. The Driver and Passenger hit multiple times instantly, crumble lifeless in their seats before anyone has time to process the sounds, link them to an attack. The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center console. The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound.
S: EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
N: The youngest Grandson wide-eyed, startled, watches as every member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go prairie dog: search with necks extended, eyes wide -- what the fuck was that? The Boy tries to turn his head away from the game to look for himself: Grandfather just pushes his head back to the game, voice harder now, in Arabic: KINGDOM 8/18/06 9.
C: GRANDFATHER
D: I said keep watching the game.
E: O.C.
S: EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - SAME MOMENT
N: Haytham instantly sprints toward another nearby Police Land Cruiser as most everyone else ducks. In Arabic:
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: LOCK DOWN!
N: Then points at the Officer in the Driver's seat:
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: MOVE!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT
N: Game forgotten. Parents up, screaming for loved ones, moving fast toward the parking lot. The Middle-Eastern Officer that has been watching the game hustles onto the field, next to the Pitcher, waves people toward him. Gathering but sporadic gun-fire in very near distance.
C: WATCHING OFFICER
D: COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME!
E: accented English
N: People immediately flocking around the authority figure.
T: CUT TO:
N: The 14 year-old Indian Girl running in, more puzzled than scared: why is that Cop wearing a jacket in this heat? BACK TO: The Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket. The Pitcher sees it, instinctively tries to rip it away from him. Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can, shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket...
S: EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
N: The youngest grandson's wide-eyed face. Then we see the Grandfather's right-hand slide down the other side of his youngest Grandson's face, coming to rest on his other temple: making sure he's still watching the Softball diamond now. The Grandfather's right hand: missing an index and middle finger. KINGDOM 8/18/06 10.
S: EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT
N: Panic. The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away... The Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger, vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue- black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the light standards surrounding the field and parking lot.
S: EXT. CINDER-BLOCK CONCESSION STAND - SAME MOMENT
N: Located behind straight-a-way center field, at the nexus of four fields. We see it from profile as shock-wave and shrapnel blast the structure: another Officer hiding behind it staggers out now, sprawls ugly: balance fucked from a blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified yellow plastic power drill. Moves uneasy toward screams in the nearby parking lot.
S: EXT. SOFTBALL DIAMOND PARKING LOT - NEXT MOMENT
N: The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African- American woman pinned under a Toyota. She hyperventilates, her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the 14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another desperate to escape.
S: EXT. ADJACENT STREET - NEXT MOMENT
N: Panicked women walking dogs. Frozen. A Police Land Cruiser with bullet-scarred windows roars around the corner. Stops near the women. They smile: cavalry to the rescue. Then a man with leans out the window with an AR-15: point-blank staccato. Tracers exit bodies, drill asphalt. The Land Cruiser rolls, spraying passing homes indiscriminate...
S: INT. JACKED LAND CRUISER - NEXT MOMENT
N: Tearing through the streets, Passenger firing at all signs of life. Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load. Leans back out -- before he can begin firing again- KINGDOM 8/18/06 11.
S: EXT. COMPOUND STREET - SAME MOMENT
N: -another Police Land Cruiser from nowhere hammers their Driver's side. Vicious. The Passenger is launched out his window, head-first into the curb. Both vehicles smoke- screech. Momentary pause after the a massive collision. Then Sergeant Haytham, 9MM in-hand, falls from the Second Land Cruiser. Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards, leaking all it's vital fluids, it's snapped drive-shaft leaving a groove in the pavement. And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip into the interior while walking along side. The Officer Haytham told to 'move,' rips himself from the Passenger's side of their vehicle, bleeding profusely, screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio.
S: EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
N: Just the youngest Grandson's horrified eyes: he had no choice but to see it all, carnage painted permanently. His face still held tight between his Grandfather's hands. In Arabic:
C: GRANDFATHER
D: Our Time is not a peaceful one. God has left it to us to make it so.
E: O.C.
N: Hold on those deep, young, brown eyes. Those young brown eyes finally blink.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WASHINGTON DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- LATER
N: Everyone eats snacks that the Fleurys brought. Kevin's the center of attention. Fleury's passing out juice boxes. Fleury's cell phone vibrates. TIGHT ON THE ID: 911. Fleury's mid-juice-pass, answering his phone at the same time. Kevin looks to his Dad, already grimacing. Fleury walks away from the kids.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Fran?
E: surprised
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 12. We hear Fran's voice as though we're on the line with him: raspy-ragged, like he's been crying.
C: FRAN
D: You getting this yet?
E: O.S.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Hey, I'm at Kevin's school. What's goin' on?
C: FRAN
D: I'm sorry, Brother. Riyadh. Many Dead.
E: O.S. beat
N: Fleury's demeanor shifts to HARD immediately.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Where exactly?
C: FRAN
D: The Al-Rahmah Western Housing Compound. Oil Company employees. Hit a company picnic.
E: O.S.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: How?
C: FRAN
D: Big. Broad daylight. Blew up a softball game. Kids, Brother.
E: O.S. tears
N: Fleury looks at the kids eating and laughing.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Dad?
N: Fleury smiles best he can at his Son. Into the phone:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: When?
C: FRAN
D: Just went off -- twenty minutes ago. Two bombers. A Shooter crew as diversion...it's just awful.
E: O.S.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Fran, I'm rollin' right now. Let me call you back: I gotta ring bells
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 13.
C: FRAN MANNER
D: Go. I'll be here.
E: O.S.
N: Fleury hangs up, walks to Kevin, kneels down - oblivious to everyone watching.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Son, I gotta go to work.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: We're gonna do ceramics...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I gotta go to work...
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Who was that?
E: points to the phone
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Big Fran -- you remember him?
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Uncle Fran? Put peanuts in his Coke so he could drink and eat all at the same time?
E: beat, thinking
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Where he's from in South Carolina that's called fine-dining, Bud.
E: smile
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: What happened?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Something bad.
E: beat
C: KEVIN
D: `Lotta bad people out there...'
E: impression of his Dad
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I love you.
E: smiles, already homesick
N: Kisses his boy's forehead hard.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: You gonna go see him?
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 14.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm gonna try...
N: Looks at Lyla who's been through this drill too many times, knows this face. Ronald can only give a little shrug, which Lyla gives right back.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Can you get a ride?
E: CONT'D to Lyla
N: She nods yes. Miss Ross nearby, surprised by this:
C: MISS ROSS
D: Where's your husband going?
C: LYLA FLEURY
D: Ex-husband, and God knows.
N: Then a wave of fear ripples across her face. She hesitates, then calls after him:
C: LYLA FLEURY
D: BE SAFE.
E: CONT'D
N: Ronald turns, gives a little Cheshire grin, puts the phone back up to his ear.
S: EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPOUND BLAST SITES - EVENING
N: The shattered softball diamond and parking lot. Emergency lights swirl from everywhere. Acrid smoke. FRANCIS MANNER (FBI LEGAT, US Embassy) is giant. The kind of American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Military whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G- shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain. Hangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable lights that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men. Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking lot. Fran has to do something/anything. Move through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover. She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in. She is the woman we met at the gate of the compound. She wants her baby. KINGDOM 8/18/06 15. Fran bloodied, just kind of steps away from the woman. Leaves the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt.
C: VOICE
D: Fran. You gotta stand Big Man...
E: O.C. immediately behind
N: Fran turns to find REX BURR: 5'7" fireplug. A long silence. Fran points to the hat:
C: FRANCIS MANNER
D: Rex, how old were you when your hat was that small?
N: We watch tears well in Rex's eyes...
C: REX BURR
D: You gotta stand, Big Man.
N: Fran does. Wipes his hands on his pants. Slack-jaw hopeless. The first moments in what will be weeks of reverse- engineering the murders of unknown dozens. He and Rex step to a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the proximity. SAUDI emergency teams sprint past. Fran spits, settles in:
C: FRANCIS MANNER
D: We need to get everyone back, then get all their-
N: SOMETHING HUGE EXPLODES over their shoulders, 50 yards away. The Attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their heads, hit them again. Five times the size of the suicide bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get decimated.
S: EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPLEX - NEXT MOMENT
N: Slowly lift up and hold on Al-Rahmah as it burns. Black smoke and flame pour skyward from the site of the coup de grace explosion. Massive crater. Screams. Chaos postcard. KINGDOM 8/18/06 16.
S: 29A EXT. WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY 29A
N: Establishing shot.
S: 29B INT. FRAN MANNER'S WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY 29B
N: Fleury sits with GLENDA MANNER... a toy remote-control robot comes into the room. Little Teddy Manner (5) peeks his head around the corner of a door.
C: GLENDA
D: It was... I don't know what time it was... the dishwasher's broken...I was waiting for the dishwasher... The doorbell rang - I thought it was... it wasn't the dishwasher guy...It wasn't. It wasn't.
N: Glenda breaks down, starts to completely lose it. Her little boy Teddy climbs up onto his mother.
S: 29C INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - TEDDY'S ROOM - LATER 29C
N: Fleury sits on the bed with little Teddy looking at a beautiful black and white photo of Fran holding a new born Teddy up over his head. Eye to eye. Little Teddy shows Fleury his toy helicopter. His dad's soldier boots. Fleury can't take it.
S: 29D INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 29D
N: Fleury stands with Glenda.
C: FLEURY
D: Glenda, I want you to look at me.
N: A PAUSE: Fleury freezes up on a shock of raw emotion, struggling to contain himself.
C: FLEURY
D: Please... I'm going to take care of this. Whoever did this... I give you my word. Whoever did this will pay. I can't change this, but I can promise you that I will make someone pay for this.
E: CONT'D
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 17.
S: INT. HOOVER BUILDING, FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY, EST
N: Startling quiet in contrast. AGENTS cluster beneath 32-inch Televisions suspended from the ceiling. Tuned to Al-Jazeera, CNN, BBC, etc. Most eyes focus on the double-bloody scoops from CNN. Volume low:
C: CNN REPORTER
D: ...1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi Arabia, in or around the `Al- Rahmah' western housing complex near Riyadh. More than 100 feared dead, including children. The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a `heinous act possibly committed by foreigners...'
C: BBC REPORTER
D: ...homes to thousands of Westerners and other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom, there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years. As such, they have become very tight in terms of security, with both the Saudi National Guard and police taking command.
N: Fleury walks under the televisions. A folder in-hand, heading down a long hallway, subordinating his fury to tasks-at-hand.
S: INT. COMMAND & TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER (CTOC) - NEXT
N: MOMENT Fleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 Agents seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of coffee. Plasma screens behind show still-images of the crime cribbed from Al-Jazeera. Throughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of his ERTs.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms. Special Agent Fran Manner was killed.
E: beat
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 18. JANET MAYES, 29 years-old, stifles a sob in the front row. Fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on Janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but Janet hears. Whatever his words, they give back her composure. She nods.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: So was Rex Burr from State.
E: CONT'D
N: Fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium. No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real trouble maintaining control...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Fran was the best among us...we'll feel this loss the rest of our days... Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes.
E: CONT'D beat, moment to regroup
N: GRANT SYKES. 50 years-old. Virginia State Trooper before joining the FBI. Law-and-order formidable: sharp-smart Charlottesville accent. Studies the images for a beat...
C: GRANT SYKES
D: From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. Don't know anything about where or what it was yet.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: This is how they do it.
N: ADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator. There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his drawing: KINGDOM 8/18/06 19.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: I already know the answer, but any chance in Hell we get to go over there, use our hands?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: If you already know the answer Adam, why ask the question?
N: Fleury circles Leavitt's name on the roster. Leavitt never stops drawing.
C: SYKES
D: We're not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere else...these ain't hot-wired artillery shells waiting for Humvees to roll by. These hits are coordinated: planning, timing, and big, broad- daylight balls-
E: pointing at the screens
C: JANET MAYES
D: Yeah, So... did they all happen during daylight?
E: almost trance-studying the images
N: Another great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses his name off of his roster. Then: AGENT #1 Yes. At least the first parts of the attacks. Everyone smells it: that's big -- more proof these attacks are being carried out by one, very skilled Terror Cell.
C: JANET MAYES
D: We had two others...North of Riyadh and the oil thing. What was that?
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: The Refinery... Ras Tenura Refinery.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. Right?
E: MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 20.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Same thing. Followed by machine gun crews. Collect and kill.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Yup.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: This is not new in concept. It is new in scope. It's bigger. Very sophisticated. Command and control was flawless. They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it... they did it by being patient.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks?
N: Fleury circles Mayes' name on the ERT roster. AGENT #1 (from memory) No. I know this is the first for that.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: That's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination... has access to Saudi uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus.
C: LEAVITT
D: Anyone take credit?
N: Fleury checks from his notes.
C: FLEURY
D: Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin- Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq. Now he seems to have come home. He's clearly becoming increasingly active...
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: If it is Hamza, he's definitely turning up the volume over there.
E: MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 21.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Not to beat a dead horse, Sir, but if there was ever a time to get boots on Saudi sand...
E: CONT'D
N: Sykes studies Leavitt with what is best described as substantial skepticism. Fleury circles Sykes' name on his roster.
C: JANET MAYES
D: They can't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control. They lose control over their country, their people...then they risk losing control over the oil. They won't let us in. No way.
N: Fleury's P.O.V.: His open folder on the podium. A memo printed on Department of State letterhead. Pulls the memo, reads it aloud, calm laced with rage.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk. Therefore it is the Secretary of State's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.' The National Security Advisor and the Attorney General agreed. I'm going to get us access. Keep your go bags hot. It's gonna come fast.
E: folding the memo beat
N: Leavitt stares at Fleury as he moves fast out of the room.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Well... I guess he's gonna go get us some access. How's he gonna do that?
E: beat beat
N: Sykes just hard-eyes Leavitt. 31A SEE 29A - 29D (MOVED, NOT OMITTED) 31A KINGDOM 8/18/06 22.
S: INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - UNKNOWN TIME
N: COLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch. He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what he's observing. His POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab- cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick- fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the firecracker sound again. Al-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this over. In-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The following exchange in Arabic:
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: No falsehoods, Sergeant Haytham. What was your involvement?
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: Killing those I saw responsible.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: So none could be questioned?
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: I don't understand.
E: puzzled, angry
N: A nod from General Malik: another vicious crack.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: You were born and raised in Suweidi-
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: -that is not a crime-
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: -it should be.
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: It's not.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 23.
C: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK
D: Do you know Abu Hamza?
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: I do not.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: Your brother was killed fighting the Americans. True or false?
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: I am not my brother.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: Your brother--
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: I am NOT my brother!
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: TRUE or-
N: Al-Ghazi interrupts.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: He has answered the question.
N: Malik shoots Al-Ghazi a unequivocal SHUT THE FUCK UP hard eye. Then back on Haytham.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: We found six more uniforms than you were assigned in your possession -- that is a crime: especially when you consider the Attackers wore our Uniform...
N: Another nod, another crack. Al-Ghazi, flinching, becomes more alert.
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: Uniforms?
N: General Malik in Haytham's face:
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: Truth!
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: I sweat. I'll say it again because it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during shifts...look at my shirts.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 24.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: I am not interested in your sweat.
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: -then look at my jackets. Please. Permanent stains...no matter how many times they're cleaned...
N: Colonel Al-Ghazi grimacing now, leaves the room.
S: INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD - STORAGE - NEXT MOMENT
N: We follow. Al-Ghazi hustling into an evidence storage room. Searching. Finds a Locker labelled `Haytham.' Opens it. Pulls out several shirts still in the plastic dry-cleaning sheaths: yellowed, permanent stains on the armpits of each.
S: INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM
N: Al-Ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts, lays them down on the table in front of the General -- all business.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: He's telling the truth.
N: The only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away.
C: GENERAL ADBUL-MALIK
D: You were injured when you used your vehicle to protect your country. Do you understand?
N: Al-Ghazi moves in, begins uncuffing Haytham's bloody-raw wrists, hard-eyeing Malik the whole time. These men clearly don't like each other.
S: EXT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - LATER
N: Al-Ghazi and Haytham sit alone. Al-Ghazi smokes. Haytham looks down at his feet.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Look at me, Haytham.
N: Haytham slowly looks up at Al-Ghazi. KINGDOM 8/18/06 25.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: You saved lives today. I believe that. You served your country. I believe that.
E: CONT'D
C: HAYTHAM
D: I love my country.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I believe that, Haytham...
N: Haytham Holds Al-Ghazi's eyes a good long beat...
C: HAYTHAM
D: I love my country...
N: Al-Ghazi slow nods.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: You will have your revenge for what needed to be done to assure them you weren't involved.
E: beat, breaks eye-contact
N: Haytham never blinks. Eyes hard. Stoic. Clear.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREETS - NOON
N: GRACE looks like a barrel-chested lineman. A four-man security detail behind. He and Ronald Fleury walk side-by- side. Janet Mayes just behind them.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: Everyone's terrified, so nothing moves. Paralysis. You and your team aren't going anywhere. And this meeting is just a circle- jerk, Ronnie: Attorney General Young's going to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal. We'll be on record, but expect nothing more.
E: beat
N: Nothing from Fleury.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: Can you handle this? Keep your mouth shut when people way above you say things you'll hate?
E: CONT'D
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 26.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Yeah, sure. No problem.
E: beat
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: What about Agent Mayes?
E: re: Janet
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Ask her.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: What about you?
E: to Janet
C: JANET MAYES
D: I'll be fine.
S: INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL GIDEON YOUNG'S OFFICE - NOON
N: Fleury, Grace and Mayes enter. Handsomely decorated, expansive: a lifetime of notable handshakes framed in black and white. The biggest is a picture of Young and Billy Graham that could be titled, `lucky for you, we have all the answers.' Gideon Young sits behind his Federalist-era oak desk: a marathoner's build, a smile too bright-perfect for his age. Two others in-attendance. A pear-shaped 54 year-old man with a Midwest-honest, ruddy-oval face: Ellis Leach, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Department of State And a 51 year-old Hispanic woman in conservative Chanel: enough femininity without diminishing toughness: Maricella Canavesio, Deputy National Security Advisor, White House
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: I apologize if we're late-
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: They were early.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: You know Special Agent Fleury?
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: I do.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 27.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: This is agent Janet Mayes, she's one of our Arabic experts.
N: Janet stares at Young, looking mildly in over her head.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: OK. The latest.
N: Grace sits, nods to Fleury: you're up...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza.
N: Young just stares at Fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at a mushroom flavored Popsicle.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: Go on.
N: Fleury continues:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: A Shooter crew served as distraction. After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own attaches...to collect. Then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack. I think that's a clear signal that their definition of `Enemy' is expanding.
E: mildly sarcastic:
C: MARICELLA CANAVESIO
D: My God.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: Let us never forget how cheap life is over there. Now...I have seven minutes before my next meeting, so who's talking first? You two digested the memo?
E: to Fleury and Grace, slow like a Kindergarten teacher:
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 28. Stoic nods from each. Ellis Leach raises his hand, a tone that's worlds away from Young's.
C: ELLIS LEACH
D: I'll go first if that's okay Maricella? First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner.
E: off her `yeah, sure' nod
N: Gideon Young remembers, nods along solemnly.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: As we are about Rex Burr.
C: ELLIS LEACH
D: I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning's news. After speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. I know that's not the answer you want, but...
N: Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours.
C: MARICELLA CANAVESIO
D: My two cents: The Saudis haven't asked for FBI help. Sounds like they've done just the opposite. If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: It's all rock-solid logic.
E: to Grace and Fleury
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go ASAP-
E: beat
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: That's not going to happen
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 29. Young stands: we're done. Fleury's look: that's it? Young's already collecting his briefcase, jacket-
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: -so as we present this to the public, let's - as best we can - try to view this through an FBI Agent's eyes. And please let me know if there's anything else we can do for you.
E: CONT'D mock sincerity to the room: beat...To Grace:
N: Meeting seems over. Not quite. Fleury can't keep his mouth shut.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes?
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: Pardon me?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes.
N: Young, eyes on a Republican-gold Rolex, instantly perturbed the meeting isn't ending.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: It's some variation on vengeance... When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in.
E: beat
N: Eyes migrate to Fleury --
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: This isn't Terrorism, ma'am. It's just Serial Murder.
E: CONT'D
C: MARICELLA CANAVESIO
D: What's the distinction?
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 30.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: To call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden...
N: Fleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the following with utter precision.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer.
E: beat, fuck it: Go
N: Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a subtle nod: "Nice work."
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how...
C: JANET MAYES
D: --the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we're fighting.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 31.
C: ELLIS LEACH
D: Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters' would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.'
N: Fleury takes another deep breath.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'll say it another way: Evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours. If we can't get in now, we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. We couldn't do it at Khobar; we couldn't do it in Yemen; we have barely scratched the surface in Iraq. And we are on verge of not doing it here. They are getting stronger, we are getting weaker. I just lost a very good friend and I would very much like to go and do my job.
E: CONT'D
N: Beat.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: That was spirited... let's all thank God Special Agent Fleury doesn't make policy decisions. He'd turn the FBI into Patton's Third Army.
E: chuckle
N: Young stands. Fleury contemplates career-ending violence.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
N: Janet, Fleury and Grace walking the rows of seven-foot bronze soldiers. Street-cart hotdogs from foil wrappers.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: I see the look in your eyes. That look is trouble: old school, play ground shit, vengeance...
E: to Fleury
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 32.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: It's not vengeance.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: It ain't justice. It's stronger. We've all been there. I have. Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I just can't sit this out. I can't watch this not get dealt with. Not again. Know what my high school football coach used to say to me?
E: a beat...
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: What?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: "HIT SOMETHING." All night long, Coach Bailey would scream "HIT SOMETHING." Every play.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: That's good coaching.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm fixing to go hit something, boss. You with me?
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: How you gonna do it?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It's all about press.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: Few more moves and it's Total War, Ronnie. The only time Treason is palatable is when it's done righteously and completely...
N: Fleury digesting Grace's words: moments pass. Then he looks to Janet.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Oh, I'm in...Not a question. I'm definitely going.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 33.
S: INT. LOCAL COFFEE JOINT - 5:30 PM, EST
N: Elaine Flowers, Senior Correspondent, Washington Post: Coffee amp'd, deep black raccoon eyes - heavy wrinkled khakis. Fleury sits across from her. We've entered mid-scene:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What's your take?
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: Looks like every overthrow in history: once the guys with the guns are no longer trustworthy, the government's days are numbered.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: White House call you with a spin?
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: You kidding? We don't talk since I broke the Vice President's guy cooking dirty intel on Iran. They hate me. What's up, Fleury?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: How hard you gonna hit the Royal Family in your column tomorrow?
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: With a sledgehammer.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: With the bombings? Or other things...
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: What's "other" than the bombings?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I know you're tracking Al Haramain.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: Is that what you want to talk about? Saudi officials making donations that end up... What? Blowing up trains in Paris? Buses in London?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Sometimes. Seems that just might happen.
E: MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 34.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: We got some other stuff: Missing girls out of a Houston Four Seasons Hotel that was heavily populated by some "Saudi officials." Little things...
E: CONT'D
N: Flowers eyes go WIDE. Smiling...
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: Murder...Hookers...Houston? Can I take some notes?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm not saying that.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: Are you saying anything?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I need a favor.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: I don't do favors, Ronnie.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: When it's real and it will be real... I'll come to you with what we have first. It's yours. Exclusive.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: OK.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You call Thamer at the Embassy. Tell him that the FBI is getting real close to laying out some major Saudi VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a Boston investment firm. We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash and roll out some major embarrassment.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: Can I mention Houston?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: It's a free world, baby. Ask him to comment.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: He won't.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 35.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Tell him that I'm running the investigation.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: OK.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Tell him that I'm not the nicest kid on the block.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: That would be accurate.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I want fifteen minutes with him tonight.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: Wow. OK. And I get what?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I come to you first. No one else.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: What's really going on here, Ronnie? You going strong over Fran Manner?
N: Fleury just stares at her.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm just trying to do my job, Elaine. That's it. Call Thamer.
C: ELAINE FLOWERS
D: I'll see what I can do.
S: EXT. WILLARD HOTEL - WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT
N: Frenetic Doorman-Valet ballet. 2 black Suburbans with red- blue diplomatic plates swing onto the round-about. A bald, waif-like 38 year-old Saudi MAN gets out of the lead vehicle. Fleury waiting outside, eyes on his watch. To Thamer:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Get back in.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 36.
S: INT. DIPLOMATIC SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER
N: A big bodyguard sits up front. Fleury sits in back, aims the AC vents his way. Prince Thamer sits next to him. Bright lights from the trail suburban illuminate the interior. Prince Thamer looks more than a bit baffled.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: I had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the Post.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: She can be a bit of an exaggerator... I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's all.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: What kind of cooperation??
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: Next month would be as soon as...
N: Fleury takes a beat.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna hurt.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: My family is not decaying-
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 37.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. It's kinda funny... you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That's kinda odd.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: You have no proof of this.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered... Big...
N: Thamer is clearly rattled. Fleury is starting to crack this man.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: And this ain't the Metro section. It's above the fold, just below the date. Words like these get syndicated to papers like the Omaha World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune -- You ever been to Terrell, Texas?
E: CONT'D
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: What is your point?
N: Fleury looks back to him.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in and I want in immediately.
N: That's a rock solid answer. KINGDOM 8/18/06 38.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: Define "immediately."
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Right now immediately.
N: Fleury looks back at the Ambassador. A stare down.
C: FLEURY
D: If your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine.
N: Prince Thamer slowly reaches for his phone as Fleury opens his door.
C: FLEURY
D: I'll just be right out here.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DIPLOMATIC SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Fleury waiting. Intense. The window rolls down, Thamer looking up at Fleury. The following is fast, tight negotiating:
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: We cannot allow 100 agents-
E: trying to maintain cool
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: -4. With a 25-man security detail-
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: -even 25 more armed Americans could spark rebellion-
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: That's too bad.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: Saudi Security. That's non negotiable. You cannot bring guns into the Kingdom.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: They would be hand picked.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 39.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Whose hands?
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: Mine.
N: Fleury blinks.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: Trust me...that's the only hope of this happening.
E: CONT'D
C: FLEURY
D: If anything happens to me or my team... It's on you. Understood?
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: Cool it with the John Wayne, Mr. Fleury.
N: Fleury just stares.
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: You can have a week-
E: CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: -seven-day or work-week?
C: PRINCE THAMER
D: Work week. Five days. No guns.
N: Hands shake.
S: 42A EXT. SAUDI SHACK - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME 42A
N: No "charm." Corrugated tin. A faded blue plywood door. No one in sight. On the side of the house: a battered satellite dish...
S: INT. SAUDI SHACK - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME
N: A tiny framed Saudi National flag in the middle of a wall: green with a white sword underlining script that reads: There is no God but Allah. No other decoration. The none-too-muffled sounds of traffic: a lone window overlooking a four-lane boulevard. Then the Athan (call to prayer) for the Isha (last of the five daily prayers) trumps the traffic noise. KINGDOM 8/18/06 40. Sergeant Haytham enters, bandaged, blank, then a small smile crosses his face. An old man's weathered voice, in Arabic:
C: OLD VOICE
D: Just in time.
E: O.C.
N: Haytham's P.O.V.: His FATHER, glass-frail, lying in a bed, a small TV nearby, on but soundless. Haytham goes into a routine: rolls out two prayer mats, steps to his Father, reaches down to pick him up. His Father readies himself -- stops everything when he sees the bandages up close, the black bruises with outer rings of purple covering 1/2 of his Son's cheek. Looks into his boy's eyes.
C: HAYTHAM'S FATHER
D: What happened?
N: Haytham not returning the gaze, hoists his Father into his arms -- pain shoots up his arms from his damaged wrists.
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: You haven't heard about the attack?
C: HAYTHAM'S FATHER
D: I choose not to listen anymore. What happened to your face?
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: An attack today.
E: beat
C: HAYTHAM'S FATHER
D: Look at me.
N: Haytham looks into his father's eyes now. No words. Haytham's eyes well with tears. After a long silence:
C: HAYTHAM'S FATHER
D: Is this how they now treat the men who protect them? Can you look at me? You cannot, can you? Can you look at yourself?
E: CONT'D
N: Haytham stares at his father.
C: HAYTHAM'S FATHER
D: You are protecting the true enemies of God.

T: INTERCUT WITH THE HAYTHAM SCENE:
N: Al-Ghazi sits on pillows on the living room with his WIFE and three DAUGHTERS. A television is on, playing "MAN SAYARBAH AL MILIOUN" the Arabic "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire." Al- Ghazi's children are playing a game with peas, trying to guess which one of his hands Al-Ghazi is hiding the pea. When a girl guesses correctly, he eats a pea. From outside, we hear the call to prayer. Al-Ghazi and his family all move to prayer mats in his living room.
S: INT. ONE ROOM APARTMENT - SAME
N: Haytham continues carrying his Father to the prayer mats. Gently sets him down, Kneels down himself, carefully rolls his Dad to his stomach. Then stands to help tuck his Father -- in obvious, great arthritic pain -- into a kneeling prayer position. Kisses his father on the top of his head. And both pray.
S: INT. AL-GHAZI'S HOUSE - SAME
N: Al-Ghazi praying with his family.
S: EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - MIDNIGHT
N: A Load-Master buckling down two paletts of shrink-wrapped gear in the belly of a C-130. Sykes and Leavitt sit on a stack of FBI paletts, their feet gently tapping on battered forensic cases. Mayes approaches from the parking area.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: What was Fran Manner to her?
E: beat, re: Janet
C: GRANT SYKES
D: He taught her how to shoot, she taught him most everything else. Celebrated graduation at the IHOP in-town until some Townie called Janet something...Something not very nice. Townie didn't see Fran coming outta the Head. But he definitely felt Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw.
E: beat
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 42.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Fran didn't get bounced for that?
N: Points to Fleury's dirty Jeep arriving.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: SAC Fleury took care of him.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: How?
C: GRANT SYKES
D: If I knew how I'd be SAC Sykes. I do know the post in Riyadh was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career.
N: Leavitt looks up at Mayes as she gets within ear-shot, plops down next to them.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: What did SAC Fleury whisper in your ear this morning?
E: beat
C: JANET MAYES
D: `Grant's age is a liability.'
E: smart-ass smile
N: The three turn as Fleury approaches. Walking fast, clear sense of purpose.
C: FLEURY
D: Thanks for volunteering.
C: LEAVITT
D: Actually, I didn't volunteer.
C: FLEURY
D: Thanks anyway.
C: LEAVITT
D: We're going to Riyadh?
C: FLEURY
D: Yup.
C: SYKES
D: State department said yes?
C: FLEURY
D: Nope.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 43.
C: LEAVITT
D: White House said yes?
C: FLEURY
D: Nope.
C: LEAVITT
D: Anybody said yes?
C: FLEURY
D: Not really.
C: LEAVITT
D: Are we bringing security?
C: FLEURY
D: Nope.
N: Fleury walks onto the plane. Leaving the three on the tarmac.
C: LEAVITT
D: This is going to suck so bad.
N: And the three follow Fleury onto the massive plane.
S: INT. C-130, AIRBORNE - LATER
N: Silent. Just the lull of jet engines. The big, long boring is just beginning. Janet and Leavitt play Scrabble. Sykes sits nearby. Fleury sits up front, wide awake.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: What can four people do in five days? Really?
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Aren't you the one who demanded to go this morning?
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: I meant the FBI. I didn't mean "me."
N: Small smile from Leavitt. The Scrabble continues... KINGDOM 8/18/06 44.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: What's it like on the ground?
E: CONT'D to Janet
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Mars.
C: JANET MAYES
D: I'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we're on the ground... kind of like South Virginia.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Go easy on my kin.
C: JANET MAYES
D: It's a very confused culture. Extremely religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil. Simple religious men become trillionaires... a schizophrenic nation is born. The royal family, who we back, and everyone else.
T: Intercut with the Scrabble.
N: OMITTED (SEE 42A) THRU 53
S: EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME
N: Three-Suburban convoy turns up a driveway, waved past a guard post bristling with automatic weapons and into the circular drive of a massive, walled palace. Impersonal wealth. Two dozen SANG troops on security detail. Two Humvees equipped with anti-aircraft missiles parked 100 yards apart. Colonel Al-Ghazi out of the middle Suburban. Frisked by SANG, rough: no love lost.
S: INT. IMPERSONAL PALACE - SAME MOMENT
N: Al-Ghazi is passed to a silent, boundless staff holding serving platters jammed with cups of mint tea. A mammoth foyer. KINGDOM 8/18/06 45. PRINCE SA'AD BIN KHALED (Saudi Interior Ministry) steps out from a 20-foot high doorway: nebbish, thin, bloodshot eyes magnified by thick glasses. His hand over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. A quick wave to Al-Ghazi.
S: INT. PRINCE'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NEXT MOMENT
N: 10' X 20' gold/glass desk over a 50' X 50' rug in a 100' X 100' marble room. Al-Ghazi greets the Prince formally: kiss the right shoulder near the clavicle. The Prince's tongue chalk-white for some reason. In Arabic:
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: Four FBI Agents will be allowed to land at Prince Sultan Air Base this evening.
N: Al-Ghazi: more than mild shock.
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: General Abdul-Malik, Chief of Investigative Services for the National Guard has been put in- charge of solving this crime.
E: CONT'D
N: Clearly not sitting well with Al-Ghazi.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I know the General. I attended his interrogation of one of my men. The General does not have investigative experience.
E: beat, putting it kindly:
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: Attackers wore YOUR uniform. Police Uniforms. Some of your men may have been involved with this Cell, may still be involved. You're lucky to have a role at all.
N: Al-Ghazi silent. The Prince pulls an anti-acid tablet, puts it in his mouth: that's why his tongue is chalk-white.
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: And your role will be critically important: make sure the Americans leave our country as alive as when they arrive. Five days they will be our guests. Understood?
E: CONT'D
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 46.
S: INT. C-130 - NIGHT
N: Final descent beginning. More stars above than lights below. Landing in the middle of nowhere. Sykes sitting near Fleury, getting his game-face on.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: What's going on in there?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm good.
E: getting his bearings
N: Sykes puts his hand on Fleury's chest.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Feels like you got a beast in there, Fleury.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm good
E: beat
C: GRANT SYKES
D: "Good" is 6:00 am Sunday morning when your kid climbs into your bed, buries himself into you... sun's creeping through the windows - soft. Birds and wind-chimes... that's "good."
N: A BEAT as Fleury looks at Sykes.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm OK...You don't think I'm OK?
C: GRANT SYKES
D: I think you're not entirely clear right now. That's OK, but you got to know that. You want to go - we go. I got you, but you got to check yourself.
E: small smile
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm checked.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: OK. I'm just checking that you checked.
N: Fleury stands up. KINGDOM 8/18/06 47.
S: 57A INT. C-130 COCKPIT - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME 57A
N: Fleury pops his head into the cockpit. Two AIRFORCE PILOTS sit at the controls.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: How we doing?
N: PILOT #1 About a half hour out.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: They gonna let us land?
N: PILOT #1 We've been talking to them about an hour or so... they know we're coming.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Good.
N: PILOT #1 You don't mind my asking, but what the hell you all gonna be doing down there?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Hunting...
N: PILOT #1 Hunting...? I think of hunting, I think quail in Tennessee, deer in Pennsylvania. What kind of hunting you all gonna do in Saudi?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Big Game hunting.
S: EXT. MASSIVE, CLOSED DOWN MILITARY COMPLEX - NIGHT
N: PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, SAUDI ARABIA. Our C-130 touches down smooth on Saudi soil.
S: INT. C-130 CARGO HOLD - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME
N: Engines winding down to nothing. The team standing, slinging bags over their shoulders. Groggy but pumped. Fleury looks at his team, last bit of advice before game-time. KINGDOM 8/18/06 48.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Heads on a swivel.
S: EXT. PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME
N: The cargo door locks into place on Saudi tarmac. Fleury and the Team outside the plane now, bags dropped at their feet. 90 degrees even this late. Look-up: light washing over a small, formal Saudi military team in front of two caskets draped in American flags, and a small convoy of bullet-proof black Suburbans. Adam Leavitt will never forget this first glimpse of Saudi Arabia: surreal. Tears in Janet's eyes as she glimpses the caskets. Colonel Al-Ghazi steps up, offers his hand to Fleury. Fleury and Al-Ghazi shake:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Colonel Al-Ghazi.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Special Agent Ronald Fleury.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Your two fallen comrades, Mr. Manner and Mr. Burr.
E: beat: the caskets
N: Three men multi-task hustle to forklifts, start them up. Into the cargo hold, pulling out paletts. Things moving orderly- fast now. The Americans just kind of step back, dazed.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Passports and credentials. Please.
E: CONT'D
N: Sergeant Haytham, driving one of the suburbans, steps forward with kevlar vests for our crew.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Thank you to keep these on whenever you are outside of Al-Rahmah.
E: CONT'D
C: JANET MAYES
D: We brought our own.
N: The crew hits their bags, pulls out their vests. Another OFFICER checks each team member's FBI badge and passport. Stops at Leavitt's: an Israeli stamp on his passport. Leavitt's quick: KINGDOM 8/18/06 49.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Israeli stamp in my passport?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: That is not our concern.
E: in Arabic to the Officer
N: Al-Ghazi takes the passports and badges, hands them back.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I'm also to collect your sidearms.
E: CONT'D
N: This is like handing over your first-born. Fleury goes first. Haytham puts each weapon in a padded case.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: If each of you would please get into the middle vehicle.
E: small smile
S: INT. MIDDLE SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NIGHT
N: The speedometer at 110 m.p.h. Haytham navigates with his left hand. Prayer beads hang from the rearview mirror. Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, right hand rubbing another set of prayer beads down to nubs. The team in the back rows: all staring at the prayer beads on the mirror.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Wouldn't need the power a' prayer if there were 2 hands on the wheel.
E: whispering to Leavitt
C: ADAM LEAVIIT
D: 110 miles per hour... How do you keep so calm? I mean, really? Is it breathing--
C: JANET MAYES
D: --Shhhh....
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed.
N: Al-Ghazi on the edge of his seat, no belt, scanning for threats: sidewalks, traffic, rooftops. KINGDOM 8/18/06 50. His left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an Mp-5 machine gun. Fleury takes in a deep breath: let's see who this guy is.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Colonel, have you ever been to the US?
E: CONT'D
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I have been there only once. I spent four days at Quantico... I saw your Michael Jordan play for the Washington Wizards.
N: Small laughs.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You don't know what you missed... you should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls.
N: Fleury nods to Sykes, giving him the go to start in with the Bad Cop. Throughout the following exchange, we stay TIGHT ON FLEURY: in control, using Sykes to ask the questions he "diplomatically" does not want to ask.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: You have portable lights on-scene?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Yes. But your team cannot work nights.
E: loses his smile
N: Janet looks to Leavitt, then Fleury: `what did he say?' Fleury looks to Sykes, `Keep going...'
C: GRANT SYKES
D: We only have seven days: we work around the clock.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Five days. And you are not safe at night.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: We're safe during the day?
N: Fleury is about to step in when-
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: WATCH IT-SLOW!
E: in Arabic, shocking
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 51. A truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt U-turn. Over the median. Dust cloud. Heading back our way. Something big in the truck's bed. Our vehicle shimmies as Al-Ghazi flinches, drops his prayer beads. Mp-5 up to the Colonel's sight-line, muzzle tracking the truck. Leavitt leans away from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two farmers, a camel sitting in the bed. Missed their left turn. A long, nearly comical moment.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: I don't like camels.
E: smartass
N: Fleury cycling through different angles. Continues:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza was responsible for this attack?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: We don't know.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Were Saudi Police involved in the attack?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: We don't know that either.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Any word on what that third big blast was?
N: Al-Ghazi getting tired of the questions: exhausted himself.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Not yet.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: You interviewed witnesses?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: We're trying. No one who was close enough to see the things we would like to know, lived.
E: short-fuse burning
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Were any of the uniformed bombers brother-officers?
N: No answer. KINGDOM 8/18/06 52.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Do you know yet?
E: CONT'D
N: No answer. Team feeling the tension. Fleury steps in and takes charge.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You don't know the source of the blast, don't know if your own Officers were involved, but you won't let us work nights?
N: Al-Ghazi stanches an explosion. Haytham looks over at his Colonel: rarely ever seen him like this. Looks in the rear- view mirror to see Sykes, the man giving the Colonel fits. Sykes catches him looking back, gives him a quick wink into the mirror. TIGHT ON Haytham's face: the guilty little smile you give when someone takes your boss to task.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: 47 of my `brother-officers' were blown into hundreds of pieces that will take months to collect. 80,000 Officers total, across the country, at four uniforms apiece. Thousands of people who can sew forgeries. Apologies that I don't have definitive answers. You're still not working nights.
E: beat
N: Fleury stays quiet, studying, calculating, thinking: we got a Handler that's going to be tough to handle.
S: INT. GIDEON YOUNG'S OFFICE - EVENING RUSH HOUR, EST
N: Director Grace already sits in front of Young's desk.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: Good afternoon, Sir.
N: Young says nothing, just pulls a memo from his bag, clears his throat -- still no eye-contact -- reads aloud like a poor man's Orson Welles:
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: `Sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant.
E: MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 53.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: In that spirit I come before this Judiciary Committee with a painful admission. Simply: I've lost all confidence in the FBI, especially it's uppermost echelon. Entrenched and outmoded, the Leadership has shown itself fearful of the pioneering thought this Committee and I have tried to imbue. It is thus an Agency at contretemps, hindering our every effort.' And by `Committee' I mean the fucking SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON TERROR...
E: CONT'D beat
N: Young finally makes eye contact: expecting something like fear, remorse, back-pedalling...
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: Senators? Then I'd change `outmoded' to `outdated,' `echelons' to `ranks' and what in God's name is `contretemps?' These guys aren't the best and brightest-
N: Young's face flashes red, seething:
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: -never take the Lord's name in vain in this office-
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: -but you can say `Fucking?'
N: Young apoplectic now: ready to end the Director right there, when Grace leans in, lets the vague threat of physical contact manifest.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: You're going to the Senate Select Committee, but not to the President who appointed you. Why's that? I bet the President wasn't the audience you thought he'd be: I'll bet he realized you can't have Voters asking why the second- longest serving FBI Director gets fired for doing his job, for sending Agents into Saudi Arabia, seven months from mid-term elections-
E: CONT'D beat
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 54.
C: GIDEON YOUNG
D: -you really want to bet?
N: Grace snaps his ID badge off his lapel, puts it on the table.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: I do.
N: Young's pallor tells us his bluff has been called. Goes silent. Grace smells it, finishes him now:
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: Westmoreland made all us Officers write our own obituaries during Tet, when it looked like the Cong were going to end it all right there. Once we clued-in that life was finite, the loss of it no longer scared us: the end comes no matter what, it's just a question of how you want to go out: on your feet or on your knees. After that, we went out and pulled triggers until barrels melted. And Vietnam lasted another seven years. The lesson extends to this career: I ACT, knowing the end of this job will come, no matter what. You should do the same.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Grace waits: nothing else from Young. Stands, snaps his ID badge back on his lapel, walks out.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: I'll forward Fleury's reports.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. OUTSIDE AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPLEX - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME
N: The convoy brakes impossibly close to a checkpoint. Waved through perimeters staffed by SANG and Police. Fatigues, automatic rifles, peering at the tinted windows.
S: INT. MIDDLE SUBURBAN - NEXT MOMENT
N: Crew arrives at a crime-scene that spans the immediate horizon. White tents with SANG sitting under each. Industrial lights outline shattered buildings, idle heavy equipment, bombed-out automobiles. TIGHT ON MAYES looking out. KINGDOM 8/18/06 55.
C: JANET MAYES
D: That's one of the great horrors of television: Crime scene manipulation. They say a TV camera adds pounds to actresses. Isn't that what they say?
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Who's "they?"
C: JANET MAYES
D: That is what they say. Doesn't add to crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells. Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can't feel the hatred on television.
N: TIGHT ON FLEURY: Quiet and focused, taking everything in.
C: FLEURY
D: ...heads on a swivel, people.
S: EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT
N: Two more security perimeters of SANG surround the Community Center: blinding portable lights, heavy machine guns mounted in the backs of Humvees track the convoy as it comes to a stop: every troop on-guard. The Team tentatively exits: 100 pairs of glares from heavily-armed SANG. Soldiers descend on the Teams' bags, paletts of equipment. Long leers at Janet: not so much `sexual' as `wary.' Janet goes for her own bag. Haytham goes for it at the same time. Their hands accidently touch. Haytham pulls back fast, embarrassed.
C: JANET MAYES
D: EASY.
N: Janet notices the nasty marks around Haytham's right ear.
S: INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT
N: Florescent lights make it ugly. Haytham dumps duffel-bags by their bunks, SANG stack steel travel-boxes from the paletts inside. No windows, AC cranked to `coldest.' Americans sealed- in - in the name of comfort. KINGDOM 8/18/06 56. Janet's area made obvious with a floral partition. She immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. Haytham watches her undo his work.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The bathrooms are through that door. I will be here tomorrow morning so we can begin.
C: FLEURY
D: What time tomorrow morning?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Sunrise.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What time is sunrise?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: When I knock.
E: beat
N: Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on, half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: That's against fire code.
C: JANET MAYES
D: They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war. They'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You're in the jungle now, baby.
N: Silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: You alright, girl?
E: smiling
C: JANET MAYES
D: Watch it, boy.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Just asking...
C: JANET MAYES
D: Unpack.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 57. Everyone hits their own bags first.
C: FLEURY
D: Saudi slow roll...
E: to himself
N: Fleury pulls out his laptop, wakes it up from sleep mode. Eyes a photo of Kevin on his desktop, picks up the phone.
C: LYLA FLEURY
D: Hello?
E: on phone
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Hey... How are you? How's my boy?
C: LYLA FLEURY
D: We're just fine. How are you? Where are you?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm here... Lemme talk to my boy.
E: quick beat
N: A BEAT as Lyla passes the phone to Kevin.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Daddy?
E: O.S.
C: FLEURY
D: What you doing?
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: I'm talking to you. What are you doing right now, Daddy? Right now?
E: O.S.
C: FLEURY
D: I'm missing you.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Where are you?
E: O.S.
C: FLEURY
D: I'm in Saudi Arabia.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Did you see Big Fran?
E: O.S.
N: A Beat... KINGDOM 8/18/06 58.
C: FLEURY
D: Yeah... I saw him... I saw him.
E: PAUSE
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Is he still tall?
E: O.S.
C: FLEURY
D: Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall.
N: Silence... as Fleury takes a beat to collect himself.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Daddy? Are you still there?
E: O.S.
C: FLEURY
D: Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: You, too Daddy.
E: O.S.
C: FLEURY
D: I'll call you tomorrow. I love you.
C: KEVIN FLEURY
D: Bye, Daddy.
E: O.S.
N: Fleury begins unpacking.
S: EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - 4:30 AM
N: Pre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street: waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab, suited SECURITY GUARDS exit. Al-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see massive, organized security. From one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN - sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON SCHMIDT. Another 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on roof-tops, in machine-gun nests. Schmidt approaches Fleury. KINGDOM 8/18/06 59.
C: SCHMIDT
D: You are in so much trouble.
E: big smile
C: FLEURY
D: Is that right?
C: SCHMIDT
D: For sure. I mean, I don't know how you did it. Nice work, but if you live through this, which I put at about fifty percent - if you do, your balls are gonna get stretched and beaten on. Dig that?
N: Fleury stares at this freak show. Schmidt sticks out a paw.
C: SCHMIDT
D: Damon Schmidt. State Department. I'm in charge of getting you out of here.
E: CONT'D
N: PRINCE BIN KHALED and his INNER-CIRCLE exit a Suburban and approach: All in traditional dress. The Prince locks eyes with Fleury. IN THE BG, forklifts rumble-hiss to life, placing Jersey barriers around the community center.
C: SCHMIDT
D: Don't let go of his hand first. Major disrespect.
E: CONT'D
N: One of the inner-circle, without a word, takes off the FBI- emblazoned windbreaker worn by Leavitt and places it on a short-sleeved Janet. Careful not to touch skin. Only then does Prince Bin Khaled approach. A lone PHOTOGRAPHER follows: snapping pictures. Different definitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin Khaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet last: the pictures suddenly stop. The Prince gives a little curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re- start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfriend- style.
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: This is our level of commitment to bringing Terrorists to justice:
E: in Arabic
N: Motions to the Americans. No more unflattering a portrait: pre-coffee, post-twelve hour flight, hours unpacking... KINGDOM 8/18/06 60. As the cameras start flashing. Angle on Al-Ghazi and Haytham placed to stand next to the Americans. Haytham clearly not comfortable with this kind of attention.
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: We've invited American legal officials into our Kingdom despite current difficulties between the US and Islam. They will observe our advanced investigative techniques, offering helpful hints. You will please honor me with your presence tonight at my home. Yes.
E: CONT'D to Fleury in English beat, a stunted nod
N: The Prince turns back to the convoy. Entire entourage follows. One of the Security Contractors catches the jacket Janet hurls back at him, tosses it to Leavitt. Convoy gone. The team turns: 100 glares again. Fleury blinks out the camera flashes, takes in all the eyeballs. Fleury looks up at a retreating Damon Schmidt.
C: SCHMIDT
D: Nice pictures. You guys ready to go home now?
N: Dead eyes from Fleury. He's clearly not amused.
C: SCHMIDT
D: OK. If you change your minds, I got a plane fueled up and ready to go - got your name all over it...
E: CONT'D
N: He points a finger gun at Fleury.
C: SCHMIDT
D: Strap your kevlar on tight, people.
E: CONT'D
N: SCHMIDT takes off. Sykes by Fleury.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Slow roll... gonna be like when you go deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat and you sit in the ocean for hours and the crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and-
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 61.
C: FLEURY
D: Enough.
N: Haytham walks off by himself, shaking off the shady Royal photo vibe, looking back at the Americans. From behind him:
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: You're willing to die to protect your enemy?
N: Haytham turns. An older POLICE OFFICER stands with a GROUP of SANG twenty feet behind him, eyeing Haytham. Back to Fleury: he looks to Al-Ghazi.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What did the Prince say?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: That there are more rules than just not working at night.
E: beat
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What rules?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: You are here as observers. Not investigators.
N: Fleury tries to remain cool.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: That's not accurate--
N: Al-Ghazi ignores Fleury.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: --I need to make sure the sites are secure. Then you can begin observing.
N: Leavitt looks around at the Security as Al-Ghazi hustles off:
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: How could they get more secure?
E: to Fleury
N: The Team slowly realizes they're not going anywhere yet, dump their bags in a pile, already disgusted. In the distance, the group of SANG stare back at our team. KINGDOM 8/18/06 62.

N: Hold on an empty 2' X 1' X 6" balsa wood box set on a dirty linoleum floor. Ancient hands line the balsa wood box with bricks of putty- gray plastic explosive. We immediately notice the right hand is missing the index and middle fingers. The hands insert bright-red blasting caps into the explosives, lengths of detonating-wire emanating from each cap. Another set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a mixture into the box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails. Everything malevolent densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty-gray plastic explosives.
S: 68B EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER 68B
N: Al-Ghazi and General Malik stand outside. The Athan sounds for Dhuhr. 100 soldiers immediately drop to their knees.
S: INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER HOOPS COURT - 9:00 AM
N: TIGHT ON FLEURY: focused, Thinking. Sykes next to him. O.C. The Athan sounds again for Dhuhr.
C: SYKES
D: Well, this is going well...
C: FLEURY
D: Saudi Slow Roll.
N: Sykes and Fleury lean against the locked door, staring at the pathetic sight before them: Janet's truly awful jumper... that somehow swishes every time. Before she lands, cocky and smooth:
C: JANET MAYES
D: Good.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 63. Then the metallic swish of the all-weather net. Leavitt boxes out air for the non-existent rebound, grabs the ball, chest- passes it Great Santini-hard back to Janet who softly sucks in the pass. Playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots.
C: LEAVITT
D: How do you do that?
N: Janet gently bounce-passes it back:
C: JANET MAYES
D: Check.
C: LEAVITT
D: Don't say `good' again.
N: Janet takes the check from Leavitt: before he can react, she drains a 30-footer. Same cockiness, different word:
C: JANET
D: Bueno.
N: Fleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up: Al-Ghazi coming into the building. Fleury ready to vent until something surprises him: breathless, Al-Ghazi has broken a wide-sweat hustling back to the Americans. Fleury's face relaxes. He pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler, hands it to Al-Ghazi.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I am sorry for the time. You won't need you gear.
E: beat
N: Fleury can't help a small smile.
C: FLEURY
D: Of course we won't.
E: to Sykes, himself
S: EXT. AL-RAHMAH - MOMENTS LATER
N: Hands in pockets. Soak in the aftermath: shallow but wide crater, shredded backstop, nearby buildings torn, blood baked into dirt. Fifteen cars.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The remaining rules: you cannot touch evidence, question anyone without me present, touch Muslim dead, or leave my sight at anytime: your safety is my primary concern.
E: O.C.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 64.
C: FLEURY
D: I would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: And you would be mistaken.
N: Sykes looks over to Fleury. Crooked smile.
C: SYKES
D: I think it's one of those "something happens to us... his head comes off" kind of deals. Is it one of those kind of deals, Colonel?
E: to Fleury to Al-Ghazi
N: Al-Ghazi ignores Sykes.
C: FLEURY
D: So, if you're not running the investigation...who is?
N: Al-Ghazi motions to 50 MEN in uniforms different than his: SANG troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with red-flags.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The National Guard's Military Police Brigade is conducting the investigation. My orders begin and end with your health.
N: The Team: so we're on Tour. Fleury still silent.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: I thought the SANG were soldiers--
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: --the bombers didn't wear a soldier's uniform. They wore mine.
N: Fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Who is in charge of the investigation then?
N: Al-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul- Malik. Haytham's Interrogator. He pours over a table 20 feet away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him. KINGDOM 8/18/06 65.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: General Abdul-Malik. He's given us permission to walk through each crime-scene.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: To walk through? Are you kidding me?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I am not.
N: Starting to get heated.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Get him over here now and let's clarify this situation.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: There is no lack of clarification.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: There sure as hell is! I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal-
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: This is not a game show, Mr. Fleury! There are no deals made here. There is me telling you what you may or may not do and there is you doing it.
E: getting hot
N: Beat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: You will be permitted to walk through the crime scenes. When we have determined that it is safe.
E: CONT'D
N: A stand off. Fleury eyes Al-Ghazi. Trying to figure this guy out. Sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in Al- Ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated to Tour Guide. Leavitt begins taking notes. Haytham sees his notebook, snaps his fingers at Al-Ghazi who looks, nods: let him.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: OK.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 66. Fleury tight-grins. Looks off. In one of the apartments, he sees a PERSON looking down at them from behind a curtain. He tries a new tactic.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: How have you guys been doing with the witnesses?
E: CONT'D
C: AL-GHAZI
D: What witnesses?
N: Al-Ghazi just stares at Fleury.
C: FLEURY
D: I'm guessing there are a bunch of Americans, Brits... Australians? Someone must have seen something. I'm sure they're just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms. That must be a real confidence booster for them.
N: Al-Ghazi silent, staring.
C: FLEURY
D: Let me talk to them.
E: CONT'D
N: Al-Ghazi looks unsure. He was not expecting this.
S: EXT. RIPON FAMILY HOME
N: Fleury and Al-Ghazi walk up the front walk. Fleury noticing kids bikes, hockey gear, a comfortable easy chair covered in fur outside on the front porch, toy guns.
S: INT. RIPON FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER
N: Fleury sits with the RIPONS: EARL (40s) JANINE, his wife (30s), and MADDY, Earl's mother (late 60s). Earl sits on an ugly couch, a plywood sheet right above their heads. Everyone uneasy save the CAT in Maddy's lap. Fleury waves off a bottle of water from Janine. Al-Ghazi hovers awkwardly by the front door. AWKWARD INTERVIEW:
C: EARL
D: There's still a couple of hundred of us living on the compound.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 67.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Why Saudi Arabia?
N: A moment as Earl and Janine get a bit defensive:
C: EARL
D: Neither of us did anymore schooling than Electra High, Electra Texas.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: OK.
N: Al-Ghazi sees Janine smile, squeeze Earl's hand tighter.
C: EARL
D: And the jobs here pay twice what you'd make in Midland or the Gulf a' Mexico. Plus the house is free.
N: Earl's mother Maddy looks at Fleury, pets the cat.
C: JANINE RIPON
D: I call it combat pay. This place has gone Guns - Guns - Guns.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: So has Everyone else now.
C: JANINE
D: My girlfriends in Texas spend their combat pay on diamonds... I spent mine on a safe room.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Two nights back. Can you start one second before you knew anything was wrong?
E: chuckles
C: JANINE
D: We didn't really see anything. Just hit the ground and hustled to the safe room. Closed our eyes and prayed. It was so fast. So loud.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: So you really didn't see anything.
C: MADDY
D: I hit the deck. Horrible.
C: JANINE
D: Not `til after. Just the screams--
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 68.
C: EARL
D: -- the kids... they were screaming. That got me out of the house. Those kids.
C: FLEURY
D: Which kids were those?
C: JANINE
D: The Jackson kids. Tracy Jackson next door was murdered looking out her window...front of her children. No safe room over there... Not even the Men that did this should die in front a' their babies.
E: right at Al-Ghazi
N: Fleury lets moments pass. Earl rubs his wife's leg, trying to comfort her. Al-Ghazi hides emotion.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: She live with her husband?
C: EARL
D: Aaron.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: If I'm facing your house, is the Jackson home to the right or left?
E: beat
C: JANINE
D: Left.
N: Fleury looks out the window towards the Jackson house.
S: EXT. JACKSON HOME - SAME MOMENT
N: Next door to the Ripons. Fleury knocks. Door opens: a sad MAN with black bags under dying eyes. Disgusted-resigned breath through a half-open mouth. Silver watch and Polo insignia... sees Al-Ghazi, eyes come alive, teeth grit.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Mr. Aaron Jackson?
C: AARON JACKSON
D: Get him away from me-
E: re: Al-Ghazi
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 69.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: -easy, Sir. He's a friend to us-
C: AARON JACKSON
D: -I don't know either one a' you.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police-
C: AARON JACKSON
D: -the Police: they attacked.
N: Al-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi: hate. Fleury unsure what to do next.
C: AARON JACKSON
D: I just put my boys down for the first time in two days. I can't wake `em and sure as hell can't be gone if they stir on their own.
E: CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Can I come back?
C: AARON JACKSON
D: WHY?
E: too loud
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Your boys...
N: Jackson remembers the warning he just spoke...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: To ask about two nights ago.
E: CONT'D
N: Fresh tears re-animate his face:
C: AARON JACKSON
D: When my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death? Couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and I wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home?
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 70. Silence outside of Mr. Jackson's sobbing. Fleury sick to his stomach. Desperate to let this man alone. No eye contact.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: ...I won't pretend to know...
N: Aaron Jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the honesty. Then bites back into his rage:
C: AARON JACKSON
D: Kill everyone that had something to do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them. And all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them... It's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a "calling"...
E: beat
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any-
C: AARON JACKSON
D: -notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend as a Mexican? Think he couldn't handle crossing our deserts? Look around!
E: points to Al-Ghazi
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Aaron-
C: AARON JACKSON
D: -LET ME FINISH GOD DAMN YOU-
E: explodes
N: A child's scream from inside. Piercing. Scary. Jackson goes red, clenched fists, steps to Fleury who takes an instinctive step backward, guard-up. Jackson stops, spins back inside. A door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the shattered window. The screams become night terror shrieks.
S: EXT. JACKSON HOME
N: A LONG, SAD BEAT, as Fleury and Al-Ghazi stand alone in front of the Jackson house. KINGDOM 8/18/06 71.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Can we tour the compound? Can we please do that?
E: to Al-Ghazi
N: Slow nod from Al-Ghazi.
S: EXT. BOMB SITE - LATER
N: The team tours the site. As they fan out. They walk casually, but focused through the first bomb site. An inquisitive Mayes, already peering into a mostly in-tact car, halfway out of its parking spot. Al-Ghazi and Haytham watch the Americans like mother-hens.
C: JANET MAYES
D: He or she almost made it.
N: Fleury steps, looks inside: blood and safety glass coat the seat. Janet points to keys in the ignition: still at the `on' position. Then the stick-shift, pulled to the back right: reverse. The shift-knob bloody...
C: JANET MAYES
D: Makes me think of the Trade Centers -- the people on the floors above the impacts -- no matter how fast or strong or smart you are, if you're in the wrong spot, `it' will not let you get away.
E: CONT'D beat, quieter
C: FLEURY
D: That's what makes this a War.
N: Sykes notices something on the ground... he picks up a military detonator, discretely hands it over to Fleury. Fleury quietly pockets it.
S: EXT. THIRD BLAST SITE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Structures 100 feet away look like they've been hit with a God-sized sawed-off. The crater: 25-feet wide, 7-feet deep. Blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater. The bottom of the crater filled with water. A syphon-pump works overtime. No SANG Investigators around.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: About one hour into the rescue.
E: O.C.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 72.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Hit a water main?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: No -- from the tanks of this fire engine: that's the water that didn't evaporate in the blast.
N: Al-Ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire truck the way a Jackson Pollock looks like the Mona Lisa. Leavitt and Grant stand back. Quiet:
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Hole is the case. See, there's "evidence" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are "clues." Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime.
E: eyes on Fleury
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I understand that.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Glad to hear it. So can we get in there?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: No.
N: Sykes holds Al-Ghazi's gaze. Smiles.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: OK.
N: Fleury is taking in the entire crime scene. He notices a four story building half a mile off the perimeter. He watches Al-Ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into the mud, bag it himself, search for someone to give it too. Nobody. Sets it down. Stands, wipes his hands hard on his pants. Fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional: trying to feel like he's doing something.
S: EXT. DESERTED STREET, AL-RAHMAH - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Land Cruiser Haytham rammed - driver's side crushed, bullet holes, out-of-control skid-marks, asphalt scars from the snapped drive shaft... KINGDOM 8/18/06 73. Fleury is moving around the scene, restaging the shoot out. Instantly lining up the angles. Leavitt's taking digital snaps of the shattered Land Cruiser. Through the viewfinder: the caved-in door. Two snaps. A SANG passes Adam, his gun aimed a touch high.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: A little high...
E: to Fleury
C: FLEURY
D: Watt-tee...
E: to SANG, "Lower," in Arabic
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Watt-tee fuck is his gun doing up so high?
E: alt: "Watt-tee hell..."
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: This vehicle was stolen. Two drivers murdered. A team outside the blast-radius...shooting at anything. Everyone. Sergeant Haytham ended this part.
E: to Fleury beat
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Are the Shooters in-custody-
E: to Al-Ghazi
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: -dead.
N: So Sergeant Haytham speaks English...
C: FLEURY
D: Were any of these shooters your men?
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: No.
N: Fleury's thinking, looking into the car. Searching the horizon, he spots a distant apartment building providing a view of the crime scene. KINGDOM 8/18/06 74.
C: FLEURY
D: They got into the compound. Somehow...took control of this vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride?
N: Fleury gets in the car, checking out ballistic shreds in the back of the passenger seat headrest.
C: AL-GHAZI
D: No, they didn't. There were two officers in the car. Both were executed.
C: FLEURY
D: I understand that. Those men were your men--
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: -- they were. They were Police.
C: FLEURY
D: I'm sorry.
N: Al-Ghazi offers the slightest of nods to Fleury.
C: FLEURY
D: Where was this car when they hit it?
E: CONT'D
N: a77A EXT. AL-RAHMAH - MAIN GATE a77A Al-Ghazi leads our team to the main gate. Sykes and Fleury follow close.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Security is a combination of the police and military.
N: Leavitt and Mayes lag behind a bit. Leavitt makes eye contact with a YOUNG SAUDI behind the .50 caliber.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Good news is that if he shoots you, he's gonna shoot you sitting on an American tank... with an American- made bullet. So, it's kind of "all in the family."
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 75.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: How about we get into those American Suburbans... with their American A/C...
N: Al-Ghazi continues the tour as Fleury once again notes the familiar apartment off in the distance.
S: 77A EXT. AL-RAHMAH - SECURITY STATION CAR PARK - LATER 77A
N: A car port. Fleury and team moving around the area. Fleury picks up some broken glass from the ground.
C: FLEURY
D: The car was parked here?
C: AL-GHAZI
D: Yes.
C: FLEURY
D: Backed in?
C: AL-GHAZI
D: Yes.
N: Fleury studies the scene.
C: FLEURY
D: They were attacked from the front. Must have assumed the killers were fellow officers... Have any of these men been identified?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Not yet. We will check certain neighborhoods. It is likely that the four men prayed at the same Mosque.
C: JANET MAYES
D: The same Mosque is enough to identify them, link them to a cell?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Yes. If the Mosque is in Suweidi.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Suweidi?
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 76.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Suweidi is a known militant stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts.
N: On Fleury: he looks back at the homes, then up and around: He locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance.
C: FLEURY
D: Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Why?
C: FLEURY
D: Seems reasonable that the Planner had to observe and based on Hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: That is true.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view.
N: Fleury points to one particular building.
C: FLEURY
D: That building sees all three crime scenes.
N: Al-Ghazi looks up to the building. Back to Fleury.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: It's outside the walls-
E: beat
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: -c'mon now. This is insane: we got enough security to invade Suweidi, let alone that building-
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: -no you don't.
C: FLEURY
D: Could you ask?
E: to Al-Ghazi, respectful MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 77.
C: FLEURY
D: We're already seeing the crime- scenes individually -- why not all at once?
E: CONT'D
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Any answer will take-
C: FLEURY
D: -time. I understand.
N: Fleury speaks slowly and clearly now: like he's cementing his words in his own head as he speaks them.
C: FLEURY
D: You have to ask the General, then the General would ask the Prince. Does it go higher or is that... is the Prince the end of the chain?
E: CONT'D
N: Al-Ghazi hesitates, can't help but be charmed. Fleury clearly knows when to step-on or lay-off the gas. He's smooth... and HIGHLY EFFECTIVE: Al-Ghazi nods `yes' to the strange half- question.
C: FLEURY
D: We'll be at the Community Center. Janet, wanna play hoops?
E: CONT'D beat
S: INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER HOOPS COURT - NOON
N: We're in the big gym as our team sits and waits. Leavitt taps on a laptop. Janet shoots free throws by herself.
C: JANET MAYES
D: This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing... just free throws. Shaq, he'd be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers forever.
N: Leavitt calls to Fleury.
C: LEAVITT
D: Hey, Boss... check this out.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 78. Fleury moves over to Leavitt. Checks out the screen.
C: LEAVITT
D: Just posted half hour ago.
E: CONT'D
N: IMAGES ON THE COMPUTER: ARABIC EXTREMIST WEBSITE. Video footage shot from the rooftop of all three bombings and some of the machine gun killings.
C: LEAVITT
D: So self congratulatory. Makes me sick.
E: CONT'D
N: Fleury studies the footage. Backs it up plays it again and again.
S: 78A INT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - TIME UNKNOWN 78A
N: A set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a mixture into a box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails: everything malevolent densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty.
S: EXT. RIYADH SUBURB NEAR COMPOUND - AFTERNOON
N: Five car convoy moving quickly through the city.
S: EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT- LATER
N: Our convoy pulls up in front of the apartment. They exit the vehicles. Our team stands surrounded by a 50-man security detail, rifle-stocks to shoulders. Double-time it - outside the walls now, hostile territory. Two-man sniper teams out front. Al-Ghazi ten steps ahead. A SANG five car security CREW pulls up, tracking Fleury and company. A stand off between the two police forces.
S: EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT - NEXT MOMENT
N: The SANG Officer in-charge steps to Al-Ghazi. In Arabic:
C: SANG OFFICER
D: This is unacceptable.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 79.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: It's cleared with General Abdul- Malik. We have five minutes here.
C: SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
D: We were told they must remain in the vehicles...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: That is not true...
C: SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
D: They must stay in the Toyotas-
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: -report me then when you get in- touch with the General-
N: -Officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers Al-Ghazi open- handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past. Collective shock. In that breath, Haytham punishes the Officer with a left- cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him. Haytham's kick follows, catches the Officer in the sternum as he hits ground. Al-Ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the SANG second in- command. Leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two steps. Fleury aims, drills the Soldier that butted Leavitt: instant night-night. Another SANG steps up. Fleury throats him, knee caps him, and grabs his weapon before the dude hits the ground. Fleury can obviously fight... all the above happens in four seconds. Then, a `knock-it-off' gunshot aimed at the sky pops one-foot from Janet's head. We hear what she hears: one half-second of the shot, then the big ring. On her knees immediately, hand over her ear. In response: heavy-caliber gunfire flies: group flinch-n-crouch. The warning shots from a .50-caliber mounted on a Humvee racing this way from Al-Rahmah: dust plumes from the speed. Members of the security detail and the Special Forces go Mexican stand-off.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Tell me it didn't burst-tell me it didn't burst-
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 80. Al-Ghazi the first to her, touching her hand to pull it away from the ear. A SANG nearby sees this: spits two inches from Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi leans to Janet's non-ringing side:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: No blood.
N: The Humvee now slides to stop ten feet from the fracas. General Abdul-Malik out of the passenger seat, in Arabic:
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: WHO FIRED?
N: That Soldier's hand goes up sheepish. Two men out of the Humvee's backseat break him down, face first in the dirt: cuff him, lock him in the vehicle.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: AND WHY?
E: CONT'D
C: SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
D: A disagreement.
E: standing, doubled over
N: The General grabs the Officer by the back of his head: an abusive Dad. Walks him to the side.
C: GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK
D: FIVE MINUTES.
E: back to Al-Ghazi
N: Al-Ghazi looks back down at Janet, at Leavitt's bruise, at the man Fleury knocked out. Angry. Impressed: fought alongside him. Haytham hasn't moved an inch, not even when the General came, chin raised to an entire platoon: say when.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Five minutes.
E: to Fleury
N: The SANG move back. The team staggered, slowly remembering why they're here in the first place, finally make their way to the Roof Top.
S: EXT. ROOF TOP - CONTINUOUS
N: Fleury finds a table with a view. Tabletop: holes and finger- paint stains. Al-Ghazi three feet away. Both look in the same direction: two Tigers being held back. KINGDOM 8/18/06 81. Fleury's studying the housing compound through a video camera, comparing the images on his camera with what he saw posted on the internet.
C: FLEURY
D: You've seen the images of the attack posted on the internet?
C: AL-GHAZI
D: Yes.
C: FLEURY
D: Look for yourself.
N: Al-Ghazi takes the camera from Fleury. He lines up the same shots we saw posted on Leavitt's computer: clearly a match. This is where they shot the video
C: AL-GHAZI
D: He was here...
N: Another long moment. Al-Ghazi looks at the table, discarded trash: the Capri Sun containers, the candy wrappers.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Formed the plan up here: saw everything he could hit. Way too pretty a' plan to have been fully hatched on just one visit. He came here a couple times.
E: beat
N: Al-Ghazi quiet for a long while. Then he reciprocates:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The man who did this is a Saudi - this place, this neighborhood... if foreigners were up here, someone would say something.
N: Fleury looks over to the two dozen LOCALS peering out with suspicion at them on the rooftop.
C: FLEURY
D: I see.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Nobody's talking. Here, many people love Hamza - they think of him like Bin Laden. Like your Robin Hood.
N: Fleury smiles small at whatever just passed between them. Al- Ghazi stays stoic, then looks straight at Fleury: KINGDOM 8/18/06 82.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: A man who thinks of something like this ...while maybe his family played around him... scares me more than I have words to express. Shaytan...
E: CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Two big answers in two small minutes. Imagine if we had a couple days together.
E: refocusing
N: Al-Ghazi pauses.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm sure the General is good guy...and I'm just as sure he's no Investigator.
E: CONT'D
N: Al-Ghazi stands still, silent. Fleury reaches into his pocket. Reveals the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi reaches to take it. Fleury holds it for a BEAT...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Let me help you.
E: CONT'D
N: He hands the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi now pockets it. A BEAT...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: We break now: too hot to work outdoors. Then we will leave for the Palace.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: And I imagine that will run until sundown?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I had televisions delivered to your quarters to pass the downtime.
E: beat
N: Fleury just nods back.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Miss Mayes will not attend this evening. Men only.
E: CONT'D
N: Fleury looks over to Janet. Hurt, yet extremely defiant, she looks ready to attack anything that comes near her. KINGDOM 8/18/06 83.
C: FLEURY
D: You want to tell her that?
S: EXT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - EARLY EVENING
N: Cobra gunships covering the convoy as it blurs past police checkpoint after police checkpoint. Intersections shut down. Bracketed front and back by Saudi Humvees.
S: INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NEXT MOMENT
N: Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, hand on the stock of his Mp- 5: again searching for threats. Our team in back, freshly scrubbed, collared-Polos as formal as anyone thought to pack. Team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance. The convoy zipping alongside a wall now: desert-orange in color, twelve-feet high, blue ottoman tiles running the length of the wall's horizontal center-line.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: We're here.
N: The helicopters peel off at steep angles, the sound of the rotors reverberating in your chest. Leavitt watching them go:
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Big wall.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: It's a big palace.
S: INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - DAY
N: Majlis - a Saudi political ceremony in which Saudi citizens and local politicians (most aristocratic and exclusive) are permitted a brief audience with the Prince. A bizarre receiving line of sorts. Our team moves through a massive marble hallway towards the ceremony.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: How many Princes are there?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Over 5000.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: They all get palaces this big?
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 84.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Some get bigger.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Who pays for all this?
C: GRANT SYKES
D: General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet...
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The Prince will ask you about your flight, the accommodations...lite subjects. If he offers you the chance to hold his Raptors, don't flinch: it's a compliment.
E: a beat...
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: What's a Raptor?
E: to Grant: genuine worry
N: Damon Schmidt appears.
S: 85A INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - LATER 85A
N: The Prince sits on a sea of pillows. There are several small flat screens playing business reports, CNN and Al-Jazeera. Seen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a frenzy of servants. Sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re- fill. Leavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on his hand, a falcon perched on it. Leavitt holds it away from the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing the arm. Servants hold three others close-by.
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: His talons slice bone.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Super.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 85.
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: That's my most prolific Hunter. I'm trying to teach his friends there by example, but I fear it's something you're born with or not. Do you agree, Mr. Ronald? Innate or not at all?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I do.
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: What have you seen so far of our Kingdom? -- and know I can arrange tours anywhere within our borders.
E: nodding: I could tell
N: When I bull-rush our hosts you'll know it: In his quiet, calm- amidst-the-bullets tone:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your Kingdom's history is without a doubt Saudi...
N: Pin-drop silence in response to Fleury murdering the Prince's "lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle-jerk by offering tours. Bin Khaled's face sinks to gray again after the excited pink of talking about his Falcons. His hand slowly moves back over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. As Fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea-cups down, look up at him with wide-eyes.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: ..and that if you walk 300 kilometers from the compound, you will find a rooftop where the attacks were planned. I've seen that the person in this room "born with it" is right there... Everything I just said came from Colonel Al-Ghazi: his observations of the scene while he was protecting us. And I think you're absolutely right Sir: that kind of instinct can't be taught: not to Falcons. Definitely not to SANG Generals. Innate or not at all. You want the murder to stop as much as I do. Let us help.
E: CONT'D points at a gawking Al- Ghazi beat
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 86. The Prince stares at Fleury, cataloguing everything Fleury just said. Stands. In Arabic:
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: Colonel Al-Ghazi, a word.
N: As the Prince walks out with Al-Ghazi, he signals another corps of servants to serve another round of cups: coffee. Dinner over. A servant takes the Falcon from Leavitt just as he was starting to smile at it. Fleury sips his coffee. Schmidt and Sykes approach.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: That was impressive.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Think it will work?
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only play the "I'm going to the press card" like three more times. So, maybe.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: They're paranoid and overly self- protective.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: They aren't protecting anyone. There's no conspiracy. They're just terrified. Finally. The Saudis have finally seen the Monsters they helped create, because those Monsters have come home. And if Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters, that's the end.
N: Fleury opens his mouth to interrupt.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: And that end could come double- quick if they let the US "Shaytan" catch those Monsters for them. Because that's what the Saudi on the street suspects: the only thing keeping the Royal Family upright is American evil.
E: CONT'D right through Fleury's attempt to speak Fleury silent, gets it
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 87.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: That's dead on accurate. Very impressive. That's why they're making it hard on us, and that's why he wants to help `em turn the screws.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: They can have every shred of credit-
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: -you see the slums on the way in?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Yeah.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: See that even though their homes are falling down, they had satellite dishes bolted on?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Yeah...
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: Everyone already knows you're here. Credit? If the Saudis cracked this Cell while these servants were pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still leads the story with your Team.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Have you been to the crime-scene?
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: No-
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: -if you had, you'd see the evil work of real Talent. The kind that doesn't stop until it's forced.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: And the path to Hell is paved with good intentions.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You having fun?
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: Beats hell outta visa-stamping.
E: genuine smile smile vanishing MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 88.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: You're on an island. I hope you know how to get off.
E: CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: By catching Abu Hamza.
N: Raising his coffee, toasting Fleury's cup:
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: Then here's to you. Let's bet: when this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out, he's in-charge of the investigation -if so, you set me up on a date with Janet Mayes.
S: INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NIGHT
N: 100 m.p.h. Semi-grins from the Team: how the fuck did he do that? Al-Ghazi on a cell, rattling orders in excited Arabic:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: ... every investigator on-scene by midnight, 50 more portable lights, three more pumps-
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Do me a favor and tell Janet that she and Damon Schmidt got a date when he gets back to the States.
E: to Leavitt
N: Al-Ghazi points into darkness...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The rules still stand. But tomorrow will be a new day.
E: beat
S: INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - SAME MOMENT
N: TIGHT ON blasting caps, military detonators, nails, wing- nuts, bolts, jacks, marbles... young hands feed lengths of detonating wire through pre-drilled holes on a wooden cover. The cover is attached to the box with nails and a rubber mallet: no sparks. The wires are braided into one, clipped to a lead on a servo-motor attached to the box-top. A vehicle is being fitted with tire guards and heavy-duty crash bumpers - all as a man quietly talks. KINGDOM 8/18/06 89. WIDEN to reveal the MAN, being VIDEOTAPED: foretelling of new threats, face obscured by his head wrap. Several other MEN watch and listen. TIGHT ON the man's eyes. REVEAL PHOTOS on a nearby table: the Al-Rahmah compound, Fleury with Al-Ghazi, Leavitt and Mayes, Sykes and Haytham.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - MORNING, SECOND DAY
N: Half-assed gardening party. Al-Ghazi worked through the night, hasn't slept since we last saw him. Looks like it.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: From now on, any evidence you find you hand over.
N: Al-Ghazi smiles...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I'm "all ears," Special Agent Fleury.
E: CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: We should start with the dead shooters.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: They had no identification on them. Fingerprints and dental have come up empty.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Can we photograph all three of them? Couple hundred copies each...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: No problem.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like to suggest we split up as follows...
N: Sykes and Leavitt can't help small smiles. Finally getting to work. KINGDOM 8/18/06 89A. a89 EXT. BLAST SITE - MORNING a89 Sykes climbs down into the mud hole.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Fellas, what we want to do is get this water out of here... see what's really going on. Understand?
E: from the crater
N: No reaction from Saudi police
C: GRANT SYKES
D: C-VIN hunting--Data Plates-- Something drivable blew up. That's pretty obvious. Feels like ANFO to me, boys--Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil. Let's dry this hole and see if we can't figure what she was. Gotta pump?
E: CONT'D
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 90.
S: EXT. BLAST SITE - LATER
N: Grant at the Crater. Three brand-new industrial-sized pumps draining it. 30 Police INVESTIGATORS watch Sykes.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Got to get a little dirty, people. Crawl up in it. Make deep contact. You get that?
E: to the Saudis
N: Dead, confused stares from the Saudis into the mud hole... Sykes happy as a pig in shit.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Get nasty, dirty, filthy.
E: CONT'D
N: He smiles, watches another Officer write Saudi translations on the stainless-steel paint cans into which you load evidence: shrapnel, soil, DNA, shells, etc.
S: EXT. DEATH SQUAD SCENE, AL-RAHMAH - SAME MOMENT
N: A JUNIOR OFFICER double-times it to Al-Ghazi with a stack of photos: Rough head-shots of the three dead SHOOTERS. Fleury takes some, hands the rest back to Al-Ghazi.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them.
N: Fleury, Leavitt, and Al-Ghazi walk past the Land Cruiser Haytham took out. 15 Police INVESTIGATORS on-scene: Leavitt stops, drops his bag. Al-Ghazi introduces him to the Officer in-charge. Leavitt opens his evidence kit. A couple of Police can't help but sneak a peek, checking out what the American's got inside.
S: INT. RIPON HOME - LATER
N: Fleury stands with Al-Ghazi back in the Ripon home.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Would you mind doing one more thing for me?
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 91.
C: EARL
D: No, Sir.
N: Fleury pulls out the photographs.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men?
N: Fleury puts the three photographs down on the dining room table: not pretty pictures. Earl and Janine study the photos.
C: JANINE
D: ...Horrible.
N: A few moments, then:
C: EARL
D: I don't know any of them.
N: Fleury thinks a minute. Looks outside.
C: FLEURY
D: I'm just wondering. That chair out side. Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable.
C: EARL
D: That my mom's chair.
C: FLEURY
D: See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside?
C: EARL
D: All day.
C: FLEURY
D: She must pretty much see it all. Right?
C: EARL
D: She does.
C: FLEURY
D: Where is she?
C: EARL
D: She's sleeping.
N: Pause: Fleury slow nods, then... KINGDOM 8/18/06 92.
C: FLEURY
D: Let's wake her up.
T: TIME CUT:
N: Maddy up at the dinning room table, looking down at the photos.
C: MADDY
D: I've seen him.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Where?
N: Maddy thinking...
C: MADDY
D: Like, a week ago. Twice I've seen him. Watering...With the garden crews. I remember he was wearing a Liza Minnelli T-shirt. I thought that was funny.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What about the others?
C: MADDY
D: No. Just him. I remember the T- shirt. I remember thinking it was odd...?
E: closer examination
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What, the Liza Minelli shirt?
C: MADDY
D: No. I do think Liza Minelli's gone odd, but that wasn't it.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What was odd?
C: MADDY
D: He was a Saudi. The gardener.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Yeah.
C: MADDY
D: Saudis, like Americans, don't do manual labor. Blowing leaves is beneath them.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 93. Fleury looks to Al-Ghazi for confirmation. Al-Ghazi nods.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Thank you.
E: to Maddy
N: Fleury and Al-Ghazi start to leave.
C: EARL
D: Who is he?
N: Fleury looks back to Earl.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: That's one of the many things we're trying to find out...
S: EXT. RIPON FAMILY HOME - NEXT MOMENT
N: Al-Ghazi gives the photo of the IDENTIFIED SHOOTER to an AIDE waiting outside.
C: AL-GHAZI
D: Find out if he worked with the gardeners.
N: The aide takes the photo, starts walking away.
C: AL-GHAZI
D: RUN!
E: CONT'D
N: Freaked, the aide about jumps out of his skin...starts running.
S: 92A EXT. BLAST SIGHT - DAY 92A
N: Sykes has a SAUDI WORK CREW digging in the hole, pulling out pieces of charred metal. He is slowly laying out the pieces and studying them like a puzzle, trying to figure out what the hell blew up.
S: EXT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - SAME MOMENT
N: Janet and Haytham approach a 2000 square-foot M.A.S.H. Tent attached to refrigeration units. KINGDOM 8/18/06 94. FROM VARIOUS ANGLES: SANG OFFICERS look down at the Americans, dead eyed, watching them work.
S: INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT
N: The Muslim dead wrapped in white linen according to the Sunna. Western bodies lie separated from Arabs. A Saudi TECHNICIAN blankly hands Janet and Haytham lab coats to cut the cold. Three Police OFFICERS in the tent with them: Watching Janet. Haytham is looking uncomfortable as if he is embarrassed to be seen with the American woman.
S: EXT. JACKSON HOME - LATER
N: Fleury knocks at Aaron Jackson's door. A pause, the peep hole darkens. A longer pause, then the door opens. Aaron Jackson doesn't look any better. Same shirt. Packed boxes. Suit cases. Jackson is clearly getting out of Dodge.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: How are your Sons?
E: beat
N: Jackson's eyes shrink-wrapped in tears. After a long silence with no answer, Fleury hands him a sheet of paper:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: That's the name of a clinical psychologist. Works with Embassy kids...apparently very good at explaining violence-
E: CONT'D
C: AARON JACKSON
D: -what do you know about what my kids need? What they saw? What the rest of their lives might be like?
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I thought maybe your Boys...without their Mom anymore...might ask you why sometime...
E: beat
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 95. Aaron Jackson begins shaking his head yes. Tears flow free: sorrow and gratitude. He hangs on to Fleury's hand for a very long time. Silent apologies.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I will find the man responsible for the death of your wife. We're close.
E: CONT'D
C: AARON JACKSON
D: Tomorrow it'll be somebody else's wife.
E: beat
N: Fleury quiet.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Then tomorrow I'll come back.
N: Fleury turns his head: Al-Ghazi approaches on the next lawn down with three JUNIOR OFFICERS. Fleury nods goodbye to Jackson. Fleury approaches Al-Ghazi, holds up the Shooter's photo.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The gardener. We know who he is. He's on several watch lists.
N: Fleury - a slight nod of satisfaction.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: We know where he lives?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: We will very soon.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You don't seem very excited.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: These are always the easy ones to catch. Rarely does it lead to the planners. I want to take you somewhere.
E: beat
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Where?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: To someone who may be able to help us catch Hamza.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 96.
S: EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY
N: Ten Police Investigators in the crater with Grant. Outside the crater: pieces of vehicles laid out outside: 1/2 of a door, 1/4 of a front axle, bits of engine. Five feet away from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence containers. Sykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re-animated mud where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad-dashing for his chin. A chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the other: a marble. He drops it in the appropriate cannister then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator. Sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal. He studies a piece of twisted, half-melted iron. Thinking... He walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal. Starts trying to fit the two pieces...like a puzzle.
S: INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE, PRESENT DAY - NOON
N: The dead, oblong faces of the dog-walkers. Janet uses forceps to pull a wing-nut from one of the dog-walkers. Places it on a sanitary table littered with shrapnel: tiny bits of colored glass, ball-bearings, parts of razor blades, spent slugs, and scraps of unidentified metal.
S: EXT. BLAST SITE - CRATER
N: Sykes still works the two large pieces of trashed iron. Until something clicks. The fit. Sykes looks down at the connected metal.
C: SYKES
D: It's a gurney.
N: Sykes looks down at the mud colored DIGGERS.
C: SYKES
D: Who's missing an ambulance?
E: CONT'D
N: Just stares from the Saudis.
C: SYKES
D: Could somebody please go get Sergeant Haytham?
E: CONT'D
N: Confused stares from the Saudis. KINGDOM 8/18/06 97.
C: SYKES
D: Sergeant Haytham!
E: CONT'D loud
N: Inside the crater: water-level down to the ankles. Three Saudis dig around what looks to be one of the dualie-style back tires. Re-positioning to get a better grip, Sykes notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable, ragged hole, still mostly submerged. Pointing:
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Here.
N: Sykes slogs over. He drops to his knees, reaches his hand in, all the way to his shoulder, the side of his face to the water: void. Out of the crater, Sykes points to a Bobcat earth-mover, in Arabic:
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Who has the keys?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. / EXT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - SAME
N: Janet stands with the Saudi Pathologist. She prepares to take a fingerprint from a body. As the moves in to touch the Arab hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening display. Then, Haytham turns:
C: HAYTHAM
D: You cannot touch any Muslims.
N: Janet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her.
C: JANET
D: No problem. Can I still touch Americans?
C: HAYTHAM
D: Of course.
N: Janet moves back to the American dead, as the Saudi Tech continues with the Muslims. She pulls another shard of COLORED GLASS from a wound.
S: INT./ EXT. SUBURBAN - DOWNTOWN RIYADH
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 98. SERIES OF SHOTS: A two car convoy drives deep into the city. The Convoy is forced to stop across the street from a gas station as a construction crane backs into a drive way. Al-Ghazi and Fleury stare across the street as a large gas truck fills up the heavy tanks of a Saudi gas station.
C: FLEURY
D: What's gas running a gallon out here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon?
N: Al-Ghazi smiles.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: It was an American. An engineer named Karl Twitchell. Hired by Saudi Arabia to find water. He didn't find so much as a dried oasis, but he found this. Enough oil to turn the earth.
N: Fleury stares out as the oil spills out overflowing from the station tank.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: They say my country sits on over 1 trillion more barrels of recoverable oil.
E: CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: A trillion reasons for our Leaders to hold hands another one hundred years.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: A trillion reasons to keep fighting. For both sides of this War. I think our oil has begun destroying more than it creates.
E: beat
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Agreed.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 99.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I'm 46 years-old. I have three daughters. And I find myself in a place where I no longer care about `why' we are attacked. I only care that 100 people woke up a few mornings ago had no idea it was their last. When we catch the Man who murdered these people, I don't care to ask even one question...I just want to kill him...stop him. Do you understand?
E: beat, tired beat, a bit embarrassed
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Yes, I do.
N: A long moment. Just road noise. We see two men, as different from each other as they could be, yet made from the same things.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Is your first name `Colonel?'
E: CONT'D
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Faris.
E: a small smile
S: 100A INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - CONTINUOUS 100A
N: A glazed Haytham works with a Pathologist on the Muslim bodies. Their own collection of foreign objects. Janet pulls free 1/2 of a marble from a burrowed hole: explains the shards of colored glass. Cleans it in saline, holds it up to the light. We stare at it with her. Janet begins piecing together glass shards - reconstructing a MARBLE.
S: EXT. DEATH SQUAD SCENE - DAY
N: Police Investigators eat lunch under a tent 50 yards away with Leavitt. Then a red laser-sight moves across him: Three MEMBERS of his Police security-detail: smirking, pretending to fidget with an AR-15's aperture. Leavitt stares. Subtle defiance. Nobody blinks. Silent moments pass. KINGDOM 8/18/06 100. The smallest of the detail reaches over, pulls the cocking device of the rifle: round in the chamber, so stop looking at us.
S: INT. BOMB SITE - CRATER
N: Sykes, covered in mud, digging, searching for any signs of identification amongst the charred, mangled metal.
S: EXT. INTERNET CAFE - LATER
N: The small convoy pulls up next to a run down, late seventies chunk of architecture which looks like a combination bombed dentist office/ accounting firm. Weird. Two TEENAGERS in Tu- pac T-shirts smoke in front. Fleury, Al-Ghazi and a couple of Police head for the blacked out front door.
S: INT. INTERNET CAFE - CONTINUOUS
N: Moving up two flights of stairs. Dark, rundown shredded carpet. Old hip hop - cheap bass, thin speakers. Smoke. Everything grows in intensity as they move up the stairs. Two more TEENAGERS skulk past.
C: FLEURY
D: Feel like I'm back home in Detroit.
E: half joking to Al-Ghazi
N: Al-Ghazi keeps moving up and into what is definitely on Fleury's top ten list of the most bizarre places he's ever been. FLEURY'S POV: Two rooms: First is some kind of snack/smoke/TV lounge. FILIPINOS serve drinks. Packs of young Saudi MEN drink Cokes, tea, coffee, and smoke. Odd Saudi talk shows mix with hip hop. Behind, another room: bigger, overflowing with stacks of mis- matched computers. Dozens of them. Dozens of Saudi TEENAGERS plugged in. Head-phoned and mic'd. All chain smoking, all fully plugged in to CALL OF DUTY (an American war game) on line. These kids play with rabid intensity, smoking and screaming and killing. KINGDOM 8/18/06 101. Al-Ghazi moves through the crowd. A small middle aged SAUDI spots Al-Ghazi. They exchange words. Al-Ghazi waves Fleury to follow. Fleury does and follows Al-Ghazi through the computer room, into a back office.
S: INT. INTERNET CAFE - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: A middle aged Saudi: TALAL. He sits behind a cluttered desk. Art books and computers everywhere. He gets up and embraces Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi then turns to face Fleury.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: At one time, Talal was Arafat's senior bomb-maker and planner in the occupied territories. He joined Bin-Laden when Al Qaeda brought the fight to the Royal Family.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: OK. Shouldn't we arrest him or shoot him or something?
E: beat
N: Small smile from Al-Ghazi.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: He turned himself in last year during an amnesty. He's now part of a new government effort to balance the experience of Saudi Youth.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: This place is community service?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: If America figures out a way of keeping their kids off the computers please let us know.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Why did he turn himself in?
N: Before Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him in Arabic. Al-Ghazi translates:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: `You only come after I see there were bombs.
E: MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 102.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Did you know Bin Laden put 5 million-dollars on my head? Why shouldn't it be 10?'
E: CONT'D
N: Subdued laughter. Then Talal becomes quiet, grave. Al-Ghazi continues the translation:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah is someone my age -- this kind of skill is learned over decades.
E: CONT'D
N: Talal looks at Fleury now, speaking directly to him through Al-Ghazi:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: A Man who can plan the mass-murder of women and children, then go home at night to his own and sleep soundly...? That kind of Man is supremely difficult to catch.
E: O.C. CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: How does he know he slept soundly?
E: through Al-Ghazi
N: Colonel Al-Ghazi hesitates, then relays Fleury's question. Talal stares: eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed. Someone who believes he's going to Hell.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Because he hasn't stopped. You stop when their faces don't let you close your eyes...
E: O.C. translating
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Is that why you quit?
E: through Al-Ghazi
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: 17 days without sleep will make you quit anything.
E: O.C. translating
N: Two TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles as he speaks to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi translates to Fleury. KINGDOM 8/18/06 103.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: He says he makes my job easier. Here, at least they only fight and kill on computers.
E: CONT'D
N: Al-Ghazi shows Talal the detonator. The old man studies it. Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator. Al-Ghazi looks to Fleury, translates.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: He says that there are several ways to get American military equipment like this detonator but not many men in Saudi Arabia that know how to get them.
E: CONT'D
C: FLEURY
D: How do they get them?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Usually smuggled from Iraq by corrupt soldiers working with the Americans.
C: FLEURY
D: Could Hamza get this equipment?
N: Al-Ghazi asks Talal.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Without question. Yes, he could.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: How do we find him?
E: through Al-Ghazi
N: He thinks for a moment, then speaks. The boys chuckle as Al- Ghazi continues translating:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Prayer. Luck. Handshakes.
N: Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi, doesn't quite get it...
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Well, I think I get the `prayer' and `luck' parts...
E: to Al-Ghazi
N: Talal slowly stands, Al-Ghazi helping him up, moves to Fleury. Reaches his hand out to him, quietly: KINGDOM 8/18/06 104.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: His hands will feel like this.
E: O.C. translating
N: Fleury shakes Talal's hand, turns it over: index finger gone.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Every Amir at some point gets bitten by his work.
E: O.C. CONT'D translating
S: EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY
N: The Bobcat digs into the crater, over the unknown hole. Already a large pile of dirt. Another sizeable scoop down about two feet: nothing. Haytham now stands over the crater watching Sykes. Leavitt has joined him.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Whatever this is, it blasted-off like NASA.
N: Haytham yells to the Machine Operator in Arabic:
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: Driven in at an angle... go deeper...
N: Another gouge of earth: 4 feet. Nothing. Grant sits back.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: `High-order explosion' doesn't do it justice: what's left a' this looks like it was put through a wood-chipper.
N: Leavitt rubs his eyes: adrenaline long gone. Looks at his watch: time passing fast. Sykes drops to his stomach, reaches in with the TRENCHING TOOL to see how much farther the hole goes: a metallic `clink. An oxygen tank. The kind used in ambulances. Nozzle assembly gone, burst in the explosion with a force that drove it several feet into solid ground. Haytham takes a razor blade, scratches off samples of the soil and carbon for explosive residue into a fresh cannister. Then takes a wet rag, begins cleaning the tank to reveal Arabic script...
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: Hospital Identification... Ambulance identification.
E: to Sykes
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 105.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Do you know this hospital?
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: Yes.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Call it in.
S: INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER
N: Now a mini command post. Al-Ghazi works phones with Fleury and Mayes by his side. Sykes and Leavitt muddy, sitting on their cots. Leavitt tags evidence from the shootout. Al-Ghazi hangs up, looks to Fleury.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The ambulance was reported stolen from King Fahd Hospital last Wednesday, three days before the bombing.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: OK.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: There's more: I told you it wouldn't be hard to find the soldiers.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What you got?
E: focused; to Al-Ghazi
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The stolen ambulance had a twenty man crew that rotated shifts on it. We checked all twenty men. One of them, Muaath Hazmi is now of interest to us.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Why?
N: Al-Ghazi reaches for the photo of the dead shooter/attacker.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Because this gentleman is Fathi Hazmi, Muaath's brother.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 106.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Where's Muaath?
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I'm going to show you.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN RIYADH STREET - AFTERNOON
N: A five block radius has been sealed off by Police Vehicles. Fleury and his team are at the outer perimeter, crouched behind barricades at the entrance of a cul-de-sac. They're not allowed anywhere near the line of fire. They sport bullet-proof vests and helmets: look like reporters in a war-zone. Police turn away cars, neighbors. Snipers stand posted on near-by rooftops. Helicopters audible overhead. Street deserted.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: We never get to do anything fun.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Sykes, I'm guessing you don't even remember how to load your gun.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: That's not funny.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: She's not trying to be funny.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: I'm a very good shot.
C: JANET MAYES
D: I'm sure.
N: Haytham hands Al-Ghazi a walkie-talkie, in Arabic:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Neighbors clear?
C: VOICE
D: Yes.
E: O.S.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Activity or communication?
C: VOICE
D: Snipers have seen nothing. No telephone line into the house.
E: O.S.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 107.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Allahuakbar. Go.
E: beat
N: Two black Suburbans roll around the corner: out-fitted with running boards and hand rails upon which a 12-man SWAT team rides: 3 on each rail, 2 vehicles. SWAT team: military fatigues, black hoods, Mp-5 close-quarter sub-machine guns. Flying down the cul-de-sac: Half-way down the street, one of the Snipers open fire: BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. That moment an RPG fires wide of the lead Suburban. Over Al-Ghazi's walkie- talkie, in Arabic:
C: VOICE
D: ONE DOWN! RPG!
E: O.S.
N: The two SWAT-Teamers at the front of the running boards open up with their MP-5s one-handed: the front of the house puffs, bursts, disintegrates. Suburbans rip to a stop. SWAT off, move fast. Three toss flash grenades into and around the house. Massive flash-bangs. Six through the front door. Six sprinting around back. Loud AK-47 bursts from inside now...screams. Then an RPG fired inside: the rushing sound and yellow-white flash past two windows. A section of the far left wall of the house detonates from the inside out. More mechanical, silenced thwacks from the SWAT Mp-5s. Silence. Then voices from Al-Ghazi's walkie-talkie. Ambulances round the corner, fly toward the house:
C: VOICE
D: CLEAR.
E: O.S. CONT'D
S: INT. TARGETED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The team enters, wide-eyed. Four men in civilian garb, all dead: multiple bullet wounds. An Officer with four 8 X 10 mug- shots, matching them to the dead faces, dropping mug-shots on respective chests. Once he's finished, a police photographer takes new pictures of each. At the far side of the House: engineers use 2x4s to support the wall hit with the RPG. All of it has the feel of standard Saudi operation procedure. Al-Ghazi appears from the back of the house. Bends over each of the four dead men: lifting each of their hands, examining the backs of the hands quickly.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Prints are on the other side...
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 108.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I'm not looking for prints. I'm looking for fingers.
N: Stands after the last: a look of controlled frustration that Fleury files. Then Al-Ghazi motions to Sykes and Fleury.
S: INT. REAR OF THE HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT
N: Back to the rear of the house: stacks of plastic explosives, buckets of shrapnel, two Paramedics working feverishly on a SWAT Officer hit multiple times. Fleury goes about his business like a man isn't dying six feet away. Sykes is a kid in a candy store: rummaging through explosives, blasting caps, shrapnel.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: JANET...
N: Janet makes her way back. Immediately moves to the wounded SWAT Officer.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: He's gone... This shrapnel look like the stuff you pulled at the morgue?
E: CONT'D
C: JANET MAYES
D: Yeah... I pulled so much it's hard to remember it all.
E: distracted
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Bolts?
C: JANET MAYES
D: Yes.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Wing nuts?
C: JANET MAYES
D: Yeah.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Razor blades?
C: JANET MAYES
D: Sure.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 109. Al-Ghazi begins tossing the room, motions to Fleury: help. Fleury moves to him.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: ADAM...
E: calling back
C: GRANT SYKES
D: C-4...
N: Al-Ghazi dumps desk drawers: pictures of government-looking buildings, walled-compounds. Lays them out in rows, studying each. Leavitt appears, focuses on the C-4 immediately.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: -the front gates of every other western housing compound in Riyadh.
E: O.C.
N: Everybody looks at the Colonel, pointing at the pictures:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: And Embassies: Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, England...
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: The Coalition...
E: beat
N: Leavitt steps, scans the pictures, picks up two in particular: buildings with scaffolding and heavy equipment.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: These are all countries with Troops in Iraq -- Japanese and Italian embassies are under construction?
E: CONT'D
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: The entire Diplomatic Quarter is being retro-fitted to sustain bigger bomb blasts.
N: Janet pops her head in:
C: JANET MAYES
D: -the Prince's Convoy just showed.
N: Al-Ghazi's face: fear.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: This is bullshit. You know it. Meaningless. There's no leader here. These are kids. That's it.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 110. Al-Ghazi says nothing.
C: JANET MAYES
D: We're out of here.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Yes, that's it. Smile for the cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get it.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I'm sorry.
S: EXT. FRONT OF TARGETED HOME - MOMENTS LATER
N: Prince Bin Khaled touring the scene: reporters, photographers, his personal top-line security detail: the business suits and boots, the special ops M-4s. All on edge to be in a Saudi neighborhood. Rahman, looking like he needs sleep and vitamins. Lecturing in Arabic:
C: PRINCE BIN KHALED
D: Only in death will our enemies realize Allah never permits defiance of his almighty will.
N: Damon Schmidt trailing behind the Prince's detail. The Prince locks Al-Ghazi with a mad-dog stare in-between lesson points. One of the Prince's inner-circle heads straight for Al-Ghazi, in Arabic:
C: INNER-CIRCLE
D: Take the Americans inside now and keep them out of sight. You will be spoken to about their presence here.
S: INT. TARGETED HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT
N: The Team sitting on the floor, below the window sills, away from the holes and doors. Al-Ghazi standing, looking out the window at the spectacle. Damon Schmidt steps in: sees dead bodies and goes ghost, almost collapses. Leavitt pops up, helps him sit.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You need water?
N: A quick `no' nod: like the second before you lose lunch. KINGDOM 8/18/06 111.
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: You really ought not look at this.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: That fella got shot right through his God damn nipple...
E: pointing at the dead
C: JANET MAYES
D: Don't stare too long. It'll start living in your dreams.
N: Janet's voice causes Schmidt to immediately force composure.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: No -- I know.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You do? How did you know we were here?
E: beat
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: What Men?
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: Ask him. 3 vehicles will stay behind when the Prince and Press leave. You'll convoy straight to BA flights into Dulles -- last minute fares come out of your budget, by-the-by. Tried to swing upgrades, but check at the counter.
E: beat
N: Pissed, reproachful head-shakes.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: Turn those frowns upside down, people. This will be pitched as a stunning Saudi-only counter-punch that killed those responsible for Al-Rahmah. Al-Jazeera will play up an FBI presence, we'll play up their ties to Terror as checkmate. And everyone that was so righteously pissed back home is gonna eat crow.
E: CONT'D beat; color returning MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 112.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: Already a rumor that the guy who wrote our State Department memo-
E: CONT'D
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: -Ellis Leach?
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: You know him? He's gonna be put out to pasture: made an example of by the President to ensure all levels of government get tough on Terror. You won the hand on the River card.
E: right at Fleury
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: We didn't win shit, Schmidt. These are teenagers... children with pictures that someone far senior has provided them.
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: -kidding me? You mean those are Terrorist targets? Holy Wow. Momma, don't let your children grow up to be cowboys. Just get ready to go home and revel in the fact that for the next few weeks your shit won't stink.
E: beat
N: The phone rings that instant. Leavitt hands it up to Fleury. Schmidt holds his hand up to Janet: high-five -- she gives it up slowly, warily, semi-charmed:
C: DAMON SCHMIDT
D: Double or nothing that's a congratulatory call.
E: CONT'D to Janet
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Hello? Yes, Sir. We're all here and healthy. I'm sitting next to their corpses but this may not be over. These don't feel like anything resembling senior leadership- -thank you Sir. I do.
E: beat beat MORE
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 113.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Please do me one favor before we board: warn every `Coalition-of-the- Willing' or whatever the hell we're calling our Iraq allies now, that pictures of their Riyadh embassies were found in this Cell's safe- house.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. SUBURBAN - LATER
N: Flying down a highway. Haytham driving. Sykes up front. The rest of the team crammed in back: Fleury next to Al-Ghazi; Mayes and Leavitt on the back bench. Everyone spent. Grant stares up at a distant jet climbing-out. The police radio belching calm codes and calls every few seconds.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: What do you think?
E: to Al-Gahzi
N: Al-Ghazi looks up at Fleury, slowly shakes his head.
C: AL-GHAZI
D: Amateurs. It's a small win.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Yeah.
N: A beat.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'm thinking about New York - February 26, 1993. The first time they tried to hit the Trade Towers.
E: CONT'D
C: GRANT SYKES
D: I'm thinking about going straight to Dan's, gonna order six PBRs-
C: JANET MAYES
D: -Pabst?
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Keep it real. You ever drink PBR, Haytham?
C: HAYTHAM
D: No.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Any beer?
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 114.
C: HAYTHAM
D: No.
E: small smile
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Now...that's just unreasonable. Good Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which enables the other?
N: In the back, Al-Ghazi can't help a small smile either. Fleury's not into it. All business, pissed, clearly does not want Pabst.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Remember how we caught that cell?
E: to Al-Ghazi
C: AL-GHAZI
D: Yes. Car bomb. He went back to pick up his deposit on the rental car.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Four hundred dollars. For four hundred dollars, he was caught. Stupidity. Catching the cell was easy. Just like this. The cell came back.
N: Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi. He knows the win is small. Also knows that's all she wrote, for now.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: I'll be back.
E: CONT'D
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Yes, you will.
N: The POLICE BAND suddenly squelches loud with excited Arabic. Everyone perks, leans up to listen to the urgency.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Religious demonstration in progress. Back near the City Center.
E: CONT'D translating radio chatter
N: A small collective smirk, sigh of relief. Fleury turns in his seat. KINGDOM 8/18/06 115.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: I'm serious. Beer will open up your subconscious. Canned beer especially. Give you instincts they can't teach-
N: Fleury notices the Suburban bringing up the rear has dropped back.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Is he responding to the call? Dropped back...
E: looking back
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: What?
E: O.C. turning
N: Al-Ghazi and Fleury both looking back to the following Suburban now. Dropped back, sunglasses and blank faces staring back at them. Fleury looks to the overpass above - he sees a YOUNG MAN on a cell phone. As they pass, the kid runs to watch them from the other side. Al-Ghazi gets to the CB radio, in Arabic:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Tighten up-
E: CONT'D
N: -the trailing Suburban doesn't `tighten up.' It falls further back. Fleury instinctively turns, wide-eyed -- out the window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the Convoy. Without hesitation Fleury reaches over Haytham, rips the steering-wheel right, nosing away from the approach... 114 THRU 116 OMITTED
S: EXT. SAUDI HIGHWAY - SAME MOMENT
N: Our Suburban on two wheels: The lead Suburban turns the same direction a twitch too late. The small brown truck detonates. The lead Suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion broadside, essentially shielding our vehicle. Flame spits through the lead vehicle as it spins, flips onto its roof. KINGDOM 8/18/06 116.
S: INT. OUR SUBURBAN - NEXT MOMENT
N: Off-road now, violent impacts on bare rims shedding rubber.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT
N: The lead Suburban: tortoise on its back, engulfed, still sliding. Fleury's Suburban fish-tailing. The Lead Suburban blows in-half now as the gas tank ruptures. A football-sized shard of metal explodes through our windshield-
S: INT. OUR SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT
N: - and smashes straight out the back, taking the rear cargo door with it. The shock of it causes Haytham to lose control in earnest now. The Suburban flips, barrel rolls. Violent pounding inside the vehicle. Motion stops: upside down, just the roar of the big Detroit V-8 red-lining, wheels spinning in air. Everyone dazed, border-line unconscious. Fleury's bell rung the worst, trying to function, get his bearings. Fleury touches Leavitt's face, can barely see through the gathering smoke that smells like oil.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You whole?
C: ADAM LEAVITT
D: Think so-
N: Leavitt unbuckles his seat belt and smashes head first into the ceiling -- running FOOTFALLS approach, quick yell-yips in Arabic: commands? The Driver and three other Police Officers from the trailing Suburban. Smoke fills the interior now: thank God these Police Officers have ripped open a door: saviors. They grip Leavitt by his hair because it's the only thing they can grab. Alarmed, Al-Ghazi begins to scramble for Leavitt.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: This is not right!
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 117. Haytham gets a good look at the driver, recognizes him as the officer who shamed him at the compound on day one. Haytham moves to unbuckle. Fleury's trying to claw towards Leavitt. Throwing upside down punches at the air. Unbuckles himself now.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: WHAT THE-
C: JANET MAYES
D: ADAM! WHAT -- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
E: panicked
N: Alarm rising, everyone else unbuckles and smashes into the ceiling as horizons go flip-flop confusion.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT
N: Leavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to the trail Suburban, idling. Pistol-whipped viciously, repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. Another Officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an AK-47, pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed occupants of our Suburban- -the Officer's ankles and shins detonate. POP-POP-POP-POP from the driver's seat: Haytham. Screams from the would-be shooter at double volume. Haytham keeps firing as the Officer, hit multiple times, falls hard. The trailing Suburban hesitates, slams into our Suburban just as Fleury is getting out of the wreckage. Everybody else still inside, knocked silly. The trailing Suburban backs up quick. Fleury instinctively goes for his holster: empty for days now.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: GUN!
N: Trailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle -- in the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: -DOOR HELP-
N: Fleury rips Grant's door open. Trapped smoke billows, clears: Grant's arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at an unnatural angle, bleeding badly. KINGDOM 8/18/06 118.
C: GRANT SYKES
D: Can't release-
E: CONT'D
N: Fleury begins sawing Grant's seat-belt with a jagged piece of metal.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Hands up -- you're gonna fall-
N: Sykes still does, ugly. Fleury and Janet rip him free of the Suburban. Haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail. In Arabic:
C: SERGEANT HAYTHAM
D: They're going to disappear...
N: Desperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al- Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet around Sykes' reminder of an arm. Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the larger mass, then the topper- -AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts around us: this attack is still going. Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening to finish the job. Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: GET DOWN!
E: back to his crew
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 119. Al-Ghazi starts screaming in Arabic, motioning frantically to the CITIZENS who have turned back, running toward them, in Arabic:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: DOWN!
N: Fleury's view blocked by fleeing Saudis: just intermittent flashes of the Mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud behind them, sliding toward the opening Fleury pre-sighted. Intermittent wild shots fired from the SUV, vaguely in our direction. Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just forward of the handle: full-auto. Takes a deep, measured Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap. The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears. Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's side window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us. Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line of stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, still running. Fleury right on his heels.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: WE MOVE NOW OR WE LOSE HIM.
E: CONT'D
N: Early 90's Land Rover. Desert tough. Driver long-gone, exhaust plumes pumping out. Al-Ghazi dives into the Driver's seat, Fleury shotgun. Guns it to the rest of the Survivors, an eye on the rooster-tail of the Mercedes he and Fleury just shredded, heading the same direction as Leavitt's kidnappers. Al-Ghazi jumps out, ushers Haytham into the Driver's seat. In Arabic:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: You know Suweidi -- you know how to go fast.
E: CONT'D
N: Fleury helps Sykes into the rear. Janet loads the weapons. Jump in. The Land Rover spits it's own tell-tale plume as it sprints away down the median, dodging traffic, in desperate pursuit. Startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves elsewhere. Receding engines. Petering screams/shouts. KINGDOM 8/18/06 120. Hold on the flipped, still burning/still smoking Suburbans. Surreal in the sun/smoke/haze.
S: INT. TRAIL SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT
N: Driving as fast-hard as possible. No regard for anyone/thing. Passport Officer up front pulls a cell-phone. A THIRD AND FOURTH in the back still beating and zip-cuffing Leavitt.
S: INT. LAND ROVER - NEXT MOMENT
N: Janet's sitting with Sykes in the rear, readying weapons and ammo. She hands him twin Berettas - Sykes' double-fisting despite his wound, looking forward to a fight.
C: SYKES
D: Nobody's gonna hurt Leavitt but me.
N: Driver's Seat P.O.V.: on the median, 95 MPH, dodging abandoned and escaping cars. High-beams flashed on-off-on- off, constant horn, gaining on the Mercedes' rooster-tail ahead of them.
S: INT. TRAIL SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT
N: Powering deep into the Suweidi neighborhood. Skid-stopping and backing into an alley between broken down three story buildings.
S: INT. LAND ROVER - SAME MOMENT
N: Haytham scanning as he drives: straining to see the plume from the second attacking vehicle way ahead, blending with other fleeing, scared motorists. We watch as the distant plume cuts hard left, at a high rate of speed... then DISAPPEARS.
S: INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT
N: Quiet. The 32 year-old son we met on the rooftop is on his cell phone again, speed-assembling an ancient VHS camera atop a tri-pod.
C: THE SON
D: DO NOT COME HERE!
E: in Arabic, frantic
N: Intercut with the Mercedes Driver yelling frantic into his cell phone: KINGDOM 8/18/06 121.
C: MERCEDES DRIVER
D: He's been shot! BE READY.
E: Arabic
N: Back in the room, A HUGE MAN dressed in paramilitary black, face wrapped in his shumagh, so only the eyes are visible, stands in front of a sheet hung from the ceiling, quietly practicing/reading a speech for an imaginary audience. Lots of gesticulating and head movement. The handle of large knife sticks from his waste band. Door BURSTS open, bottom hinge rips from the jamb. Leavitt is slammed to the ground. Passport Officer shoves the practicing Speaker out of the way- Turns to the wide-eyed 32 year-old.
C: PASSPORT OFFICER
D: NOW. HURRY.
N: Leavitt's face already swollen-black-bleeding, scanning the room with terrified fury in his eyes. He sees the handle of the knife sticking from the Huge Man's waistband. His tears leak all at once. The Officer takes the knife, turns to Leavitt: dirty 11-inch blade...
S: INT. LAND ROVER - NEXT MOMENT
N: Haytham searching for the turn-off: where the rooster-tail they were following cut left, died. At the last minute, he sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit, decaying apartment block neighborhood. Haytham cuts hard, fish-tails. Sykes' head SMASHES into the rear-side window, starring it. They're being lead into Riyadh's most hostile neighborhood.
C: AL-GHAZI
D: We should not be here...
N: JANET'S POV: scanning for the trail Suburban and the Mercedes - she can't help but notice the neighborhood. Halfway past an intersection, Fleury yells:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT...
N: Haytham brakes, reverses: the Suburban. KINGDOM 8/18/06 122.
S: INT. LAND CRUISER / EXT. SUWEIDI - NEXT MOMENT
N: Without hesitation Haytham pulls across the cramped street, surrounded by the same decaying buildings. Ahead: CIVILIANS huddled behind cars, poking heads out from behind shacks. A second passes: these people know where the attackers went. Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the little boy was nodding a warning- What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat:
C: GRANT SYKES
D: -GET OUT OF-
N: -big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes. A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off the roof and into the Land Cruiser. Frantic, Fleury swats it out. The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4: returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle: firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.
S: EXT. ROOF TOP - NEXT MOMENT
N: A SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white- black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what else. Shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge, firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting a fire-cracker. KINGDOM 8/18/06 123. We see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun. Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for eternity. Fleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from the doorway.
S: EXT. SUWEIDI STREET - NEXT MOMENT
N: Haytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head. Janet and Sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover. From the rooftop, Fleury yells down to the men on the ground.
C: FLEURY
D: I CAN SEE THE MERCEDES... BLOOD- TRAILS RIGHT UP TO AN APARTMENT IN THE NEXT BUILDING-
E: O.C.
S: EXT. ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
N: Fleury's P.O.V.: an Apartment complex that looks like a roadside motel: exposed stairwells, walkways, entrances. A puddle in front of one of the front doors on the third floor. Then we look right, one street over: civilian FIGURES, some in traditional dress, starting to mass.
C: FLEURY
D: MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK!
N: He drops the riot gun, picks up the AK from the man he just killed, pops a new clip from the backpack, slings the backpack over her shoulders. Starts to hustle down.
S: INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT
N: Gunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old, hands shaking with nerves, screwing the camera into the tri- pod: set-up almost complete. The Passport Officer is posted at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready. KINGDOM 8/18/06 124. We can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway. Passport Officer barks something back. The Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic.
C: DRIVER
D: READY?
N: Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera, trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground, battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin hammering Adam.
C: PASSPORT OFFICER
D: GOD DAMN HIM!
E: O.C. in Arabic
N: 32 year-old picks the camera up again, trying to re-attach the battery as Adam fights for his life. Spit and claws and snot and blood rage.
S: EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT
N: Running down side stairs, Fleury spots a grenade launcher poking from a door, next-door to the apartment with blood- pool in front.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: RPG!
N: Empties his clip into that vicinity: windows shatter, wood splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi start to run. The launcher fires from its new position...The trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on their asses for second and third times: dazed. Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading, how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly. Bounces just on the third floor landing-
S: INT. ENEMY APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT
N: -RPG Soldier just locking the new rocket tube in, brings the reticle up to his eye. Grenade blast splits through what's left of the front window. KINGDOM 8/18/06 125. Big flinch-tense on his part: rocket fires inside, roars down the hall, hits two feet in-front of the door Passport Officer has been peaking out of. Massive, contained detonation. Passport Officer vanishes. The 32 year-old and his camera are blown through the Driver waiting to saw Leavitt's neck. Because Leavitt was held so tight to the floor, he escapes the worst of the blast. Still fucked up. Leavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year- old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop.
S: EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - SAME MOMENT
N: Sykes takes cover between two cars, holding down the rear, firing warning shots and screaming football plays to freak out the LOCALS.
C: SYKES
D: THIRTY EIGHT RAZOR MAD DOG!!!
N: He fires above the crowd, as Janet heads into the building. Two LITTLE KIDS slowly approach carrying water, obviously terrified at the sight of the wounded American. Sirens and helicopters sound in the distance.
S: EXT./INT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT.
N: Base of the stairs: Mayes joins Fleury and a dazed Al-Ghazi & Haytham.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: A tunnel networks through all these places... they use attached civilian Apartments, innocent families.
C: JANET MAYES
D: I do not like these people.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: We go in the front door. Haytham - cover the stairs. Janet - hallway. Watch the side doors. Watch your backs.
N: Silent nods. Bracing for war... KINGDOM 8/18/06 125A. They move 3 levels up the stairs into the building, following the blood-trail from the SUV to the Apartment. PEOPLE step out of their doors. Al-Ghazi aiming at them:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: INSIDE!
E: in Arabic
S: INT. / EXT. APARTMENT 303 - NEXT MOMENT
N: The puddle of blood, a trail leading under the door. The front wall/window/entrance of the next apartment down, still smoldering from Fleury's grenade. No sounds, words. Our team: fingers on triggers, weapons to shoulders, sights-aligned. Ten feet back. Shoulders already flexed with tension, expecting a suicidal blast at any moment. Janet grabs another grenade, moves to secure the hallway. KINGDOM 8/18/06 126. Intercut Sykes outside. Haytham on the stairs.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Is Allah on the other side of that door?
E: beat, to Al-Ghazi
N: Al-Ghazi raises his prayer beads to Fleury.
C: AL-GHAZI
D: I think were about to find out, my friend.
E: beat
N: Fleury moves forward: I'm primary through the door. Al- Ghazi's right with him. Fleury gets three-point-stance low, hits the door like Jim Brown. Scattered gunfire. Fleury opens up in response. Fleury never stops forward motion. Stumbling headlong into a kitchenette, hard into a refrigerator and cabinets, firing the whole time. Al-Ghazi blasting anything that looks like a body. Straight mop-up operation.
S: INT. CINDER BLOCK APTS - HALLWAY - SAME MOMENT
N: Securing the hallway, Mayes steps into a charred apartment through doors blown off hinges. She heads in deeper, towards the bedroom. Finds the closet - it tunnels into the apartment below. She peers into the hole--
C: JANET MAYES
D: ADAM?!
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 127. -- sees a bloody knife below thrown by an unseen hand. Janet: wide-eyed horror, about to pull back, when she is YANKED into the hole by her hair.
S: INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NEXT MOMENT
N: Huge Man ATTACKS Janet. Vicious hand to hand blows. Still tied, Leavitt does what he can, kicking at the attacker. Adrenaline morphs Janet from scared and out-sized to desperate and equally vicious. This is SAVING PRIVATE RYAN shit with Leavitt as the observer. He's no coward - he's doing everything he can. Huge Man overtakes Janet, slow-choking her... she's gasping, dying... Janet has a knife out and is shredding the big man's back right thigh and ass. BOTH SCREAMING. From nowhere, Fleury ends the fight with a butt-end baseball-swing of the shot gun to Huge Man's head. Janet: fucked up, but alive.
C: JANET MAYES
D: Sykes is going to kick your ass.
E: to Leavitt
N: Al-Ghazi follows Fleury into the room. Leaning to Janet, Fleury sees Leavitt, puts his hand on his head. Leavitt's somewhere else, tears in his eyes, just taking deep, measured breaths.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: Everybody OK?
N: Slow nods from Leavitt and Janet as Fleury cuts Adam's ties.
C: FLEURY
D: There's at least three more of them.
N: As Janet's eyes catch on something: a sheet/half-assed backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down - exposing a crude square cut out of the wall - a path into another Apartment. Janet points to the hole in the wall. This isn't over: a seven-year old GIRL peers out at her, shaking, tears in her eyes. Janet tries her best Motherly smile.
C: JANET MAYES
D: It's okay Little One.
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 128. The little girl backs away. Janet gets up, steers Leavitt outside. Sits him down. Hands him a Glock. Fleury and Al-Ghazi step through the hole. Janet follows. A blood trail snakes through Little One's room, out her door, and deeper into another apartment. Little girl long gone into the main part of the Apartment. Then, Arabic SCREAMS, the metal-crashing sound of automatic GUNFIRE. Sirens overheard outside now.
S: INT. ATTACHED APARTMENT - NEXT MOMENT
N: Hustle cautious into the apartment. Haytham stands in the room already: the muzzle of his AK still smoking, held on a man down. The other occupants of the room are a cowering FAMILY: KIDS and a couple of real OLD FOLKS, all terrified. A little boy cries by himself, huddled in a corner. The collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the room. LOCKS EYES on the traumatized little boy, his innocence draining as she watches. Can't take her eyes away. TIGHT ON HAYTHAM: Taking this all in: The violence. The terror of this family, the defiance on the faces of these young souls. Al-Ghazi, post-game shakes, a tear running down his cheeks, spattered in blood, stares at Fleury. The man Haytham shot is not dead: ragged gasps. Fleury and Al-Ghazi lock eyes, then take in the tragedy of the room -- kids their children's age, never to be the same. Al-Ghazi to the room, In arabic:
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Is everyone alright?
N: Silent stares from the Saudis. The little girl Janet saw earlier, eyes still on Janet, moves to her brother - he holds her tight, his eyes down. Janet kneels, heart-breaking, holds her hand out: I can help you little one. The Little Girl holds a fist out to Janet, tears in her eyes: okay. Janet slowly crouches over to her, the older women's eyes on her, piercing.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: It's okay.
E: CONT'D to the little girl, in Arabic
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 129. Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a gift for you. Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a marble... Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things. Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al- Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: Let me help you up, Old Man...
E: CONT'D in Arabic
N: The old man nods a `no.'
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!
E: CONT'D in Arabic
N: Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al- Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his eyes, lifts his chin with his hand.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: ...Hamza.
E: CONT'D dazed, starting to realize
N: The old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under arrest.
E: CONT'D
N: ABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi.
C: NASSAR
D: You are a traitor to your country... a traitor to your God.
C: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
D: I am no traitor to my God. You are.
N: Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15 year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM. Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather with him. KINGDOM 8/18/06 130. Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son... not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick:
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: ...Don't...
N: The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims it at the boy's chest.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: ...drop it, Son...please...
E: CONT'D
N: ...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another round into the chamber. Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger. Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing, the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear. TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in Haytham's eyes. A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room. Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the bleeding... Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to Al-Ghazi. Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.
C: RONALD FLEURY
D: You got him. You got him... You got him.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. CINDER BLOCK APARTMENTS - LATER
N: KINGDOM 8/18/06 131. WIDE ON THE CRIME SCENE. From the air as choppers hover and SOLDIERS swarm. SMASH TO:
S: INT. CONVOY - SAUDI ARABIA
N: One last convoy heading out of town. Fleury, Leavitt, Janet, and Sykes: battered war scars, million mile stares.
S: EXT. PRINCE SULTAN AIRBASE - LATER
N: Our crew watch from a deserted terminal as a C-130 touches down. Haytham enters: came to say good-bye. The team's first smiles -- collective. Fleury stares at Haytham...thinks about what he's seen the past few days...how he has come to admire this Kid. Haytham smiling, bandaged himself. Halting and awkward, he shakes Janet's hand.
C: HAYTHAM
D: Thank you.
E: in Arabic
C: JANET MAYES
D: Thank you, Lieutenant Haytham.
N: Haytham says good bye to Leavitt and Sykes. Comes to Fleury. Hands him a beautiful wooden prayer bead necklace.

S: INT. WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE - CUBICLE - DAY
N: Fleury, Sykes, Leavitt and Janet sit around Janet's cubicle. Bandages, awkward silences, and 1000-yard stares. Subpoenas stacked on the corner of Janet's desk. Leavitt quiet, obviously fucked up. Grace approaches.
C: DIRECTOR GRACE
D: We're going to testify next Tuesday. Fleury's going first. I'm gonna go through it with each of you one on one in advance - make sure we're all on the same page. If they ask if we've talked about this, the answer is unequivocally "No." OK? You did outstanding work over there. I'm proud of you. You hold your heads high.
