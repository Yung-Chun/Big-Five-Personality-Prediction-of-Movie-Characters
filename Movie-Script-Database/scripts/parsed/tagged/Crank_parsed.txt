C: VIDEO SCREEN
D: EXTREME CU: PACMAN, from the old video game, just a yellow ball with a mouth, fills the screen in all it's lo-res glory. The camera tracks along as it rolls along a tight corridor, gobbling dots. 2 CUT TO:
N: EXTREME CU: A RED GHOST follows, in hot pursuit.
T: CUT TO:
N: EXTREME CU: PACMAN gives it the slip, cuts down and gobbles a big dot.
T: CUT TO:
N: EXTREME CU: RED GHOST transforms into BLUE GHOST, changes direction and runs. PACMAN chases ... P.. but just before he catches up the BLUE GHOST transforms back to RED and changes direction again. PACMAN barely escapes.
T: CUT TO:
N: PACMAN flees, but at every turn he is confronted by another ghost. The CAMERA pulls out in a series of jump cuts to reveal that unlike the old arcade game, this game screen goes E forever, an infinite maze ... and instead of the original on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides, closing in. The sound of the game redoubles, reverberates, deafening ...
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: SOUND: A HEART BEATS SLOWLY IN THE DARK.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT CHEV'S BEDROOM, MORNING 2
N: This scene plays out as a continuous POV shot, right up until CHEV's face is revealed for the first time.) CHEV CHELIOS, wakes up in his apartment to a RINGING CELL PHONE, groggy, vision doubled ... 1 .. from his POV we see him examine his hands, which don't feel right, don't want to move right. The CELL PHONE, coming from some other room, plays the PACMAN theme in beeps: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM ... He tries to get out of bed, HITS THE GROUND. Plush rug, ultra modern bed frame, night stand, high tech stereo, the works. He crawls/stumbles into ...
S: INT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS
N: ... the living room, decked out by Kostabi paintings and glass furniture then into...
S: INT CHELIOS KITCHEN, CONTINUOUS 4
N: ... the kitchen, with a black marble island and hanging copper. He jams his head under the Fossil sink and runs the water. He steadies himself against the matching black marble counter, staring at his hands ... .. tries to lift them and BANG! He's back on the floor, stunned... All the while we hear the faint sound of his HEARTBEAT... ... slow: LUBDUB... LUBDUB... LUBDUB. He begins crawling back into...
S: INT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS
N: ... the living room, toward the telephone where he spots a plain black VHS tape propped up in front of a plasma screen TV with police ribbon wrapped around it, tied in a bow, like a present.
C: CHELIOS
D: Whathufuck?
E: barely comprehensible
N: He grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the VCR and pushes PLAY.
S: INT. TV SCREEN
C: 5A 5A
D: It's RICKY VERONA on the SCREEN, a young, irritatingly slick EASTERN EURO ... little to no accent - fast talking, sarcastic, a complete dick ...
N: We see him sitting on CHEV'S bed ... CHEV is visible in the frame, unconscious behind VERONA. Pale nicotine sunlight filters in through the blinds. There are HOODS loitering around the room. It was apparently shot only hours before. The discernible sound of CHEV'S heartbeat will subliminally increase in speed and volume throughout VERONA'S monologue - the cell phone continues to ring, somewhere.)
C: VERONA
D: What's shaking, douchebag? Thought I'd give you the heads up. You're dead.
N: On the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA.
C: VERONA
D: Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ... if you're watching this tape it means that I somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal ... opting instead to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you heard me...
E: CONT'D
N: We stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it.
C: VERONA
D: ... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep. How sick is that?... for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there's nothing you can do about it...
E: CONT'D
N: Cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera; CHEV is 5 on his knees in front of the set, looking around ... we still don't see his face clearly.
C: VERONA 5A 5A
D: ... that's right, you're on candid camera, try not to embarrass yourself...
E: CONT'D
N: Cut back to CHEV'S POV. He holds his head down over the 5 carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth, GAGGING. VERONA (CONT'D) Let me guess, you're trying to puke the shit out, right? Right? Don't bother... (MORE) CONTINUED: (2) VERONA(CONT'D) the shit I gave you is some fucking high tech sci-fi Chinese synthetic shit that even I don't know exactly what the fuck it is. All I know is once it binds with your blood cells, you're fucked, baby... and believe me, it's done binded. By now you'll be feeling your joints stiffen up... hard to breath... CHEV puts his hand on the left side of his chest to feel his heart. The BEATS of the heart grow louder still, but the rhythm falters, begins to slow ...
C: VERONA
D: ... your heartbeat is slowing down like there's rust in your veins... you're like the Tin Man in the Wizard of freaking Oz...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: One of the THUGS, ALEX, contributes from offscreen.
C: 5A 5A LEX
D: "If he only had a brain."
E: amused by his own wit, singing
C: ERONA
D: Scarecrow. Whatever. You get the point. You're fucked. You got maybe an hour, max, tough guy ... baby ... sexy ...
E: irritated
N: The THUGS are into it; VERONA is rolling. One of them comes up beside the bed and plants a big kiss on CHEV'S unconscious head.
C: VERONA
D: Hey, it's been real. Probably should've thought twice before you whacked Don Kim. Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight? I thought so. Have a nice death...
E: CONT'D
N: Finally the CAMERA reverses to reveal CHEV'S slack-jawed 6 face, staring at the TV. CHEV is in his late 20s, handsome in an offhanded way. All of the background noise - the HEARTBEAT, the CELL PHONE - cuts to dead silence... and through the silence, a SINGLE WORD:
C: VERONA
D: ... asshole.
E: CONT'D
C: 5A 5A
D: 
E: A driving SOUNDTRACK kicks in. The OPENING TITLES play over the following:
N: Finding a drunken man's strength, CHEV flips out. He rips the TV out of the stand, TEARING THE WIRES FROM THE GUTS OF THE WALL. He launches it straight into the floorboards with a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH. He KICKS over the rest of the entertainment system, JUMPS on it and heads out of the room. ROLLER DOLLY follows him on a STUMBLING RAMPAGE through the apartment and down the hall. By the door, in an ashtray with his car keys, he finds it: his God-damned CELL PHONE. Of course it stops ringing just as he picks it up. He pockets it, BANGS OPEN the front door and is out.
S: INT CHEV'S APARTMENT BUILDING, CONTINUOUS
N: ROLLER DOLLY stays with him through the door and down the hall, as a businesswoman peaks her head out the door - then SLAMS IT SHUT, terrified - and then down the stairs to the garage door.
S: INT CHEV'S APARTMENT BUILDING, GARAGE, CONTINUOUS
N: ROLLER DOLLY still on CHEV. He jumps up on the hood of a moving RED SPORTSCAR as it backs out of it's parking spot, walks right over it and hops off, clicking the keyless lock button on his chain in mid-air ... the door to his BLACK AUDI pops open ... he gets in. RED SPORTSCAR GUY is the sort of classic intolerable LA ASSHOLE we love to hate: platinum hair, suspenders, designer shades, programming his Blackberry while driving, etc.
C: SPORTSCAR GUY
D: This is a eighty thousand dollar ride, cockwipe!
N: CHEV backs out, runs him right over. CH-KUNK, CH-KUNK. CHEV'S AUDI blasts out of the garage and down the street. SPORTSCAR GUY holds his backwards leg in agony.
C: SPORTSCAR GUY
D: You're a dead man!
E: CONT'D screaming like a girl
T: CUT TO:
S: INT CHEV'S AUDI, MOMENTS LATER
N: The ever-present HEARTBEAT is pounding. CHEV whips out his cell phone and dials. A HORN BLASTS. CHEV quickly looks up and yanks his steering wheel to swerve around oncoming traffic.
C: CHEV
D: JESUS!
N: The CAMERA ZOOMS in on CHEV'S CHEST: it becomes JUST SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT... we see the movement of his beating HEART SPEED UP with the near miss. he HEARTBEAT SOUND is amplified as we MOVE IN CLOSER.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT EVE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS
N: We see an old school tape answering machine pick up at her place:
C: OMAN
D: Hey, this is Eve...
E: V.O.
N: This is apparently typical - she's an answering machine girl in a cell phone world. He holds back his frustration as the message plays.
C: EVE
D: I'm glad you called, but I'm not here. Can you leave me a message? Unless you're trying to sell something, because I'm absolutely not interested. But if you're not ...
S: EXT CHEV'S AUDI, SAME TIME
N: CHEV begins to POUND HIS HEAD against the steering wheel.
C: EVE
D: ... then just ... oh, wait ... time's up -
S: INT EVE'S APARTMENT, SAME TIME
N: SOUND: beeep!
C: CHEV
D: GET A CELL PHONE!!!
E: O.S.
N: We hear CHEV'S car SQUEAL again...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT CHEV'S AUDI, SAME TIME
N: ... CHEV recovers from another near miss.
C: CHEV
D: hit!
N: He clicks off the cell. His eyes try to focus on the road. OTE: Through it all, the low beating of the heart - from slow to fast - sometimes barely audible, sometimes mixed way out front - clues us into the state of his adrenaline. He grabs up the cellphone again and punches in a speed dial.
C: CHEV
D: Come on ...
E: CONT'D
C: ANSWERING SERVICE
D: Doctor Miles' office, may I help you?
E: O.S.
C: CHEV
D: Let me talk to him.
N: SPLIT SCREEN WITH:
S: INT CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS
N: CHOCOLATE, a too-skinny, cracked-out BLACK CHICK, sits in front of a multi-line phone in a broken down apartment. She's wearing a headset. She takes a long drag off her cigarette.
C: HOCOLATE
D: I'm sorry, the doctor isn't in the office at this time, may I take -
E: a generic imitation of politeness
C: CHEV
D: Where is he?
C: CHOCOLATE
D: I beg your pardon sir?
C: CHEV
D: Where - thefuck - is - he?
N: In more SCREENS WITHIN SCREENS we see a 'WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS' sign, then DOCTOR MILES reclining on a massage table with a bunch of HOOKERS.)
C: CHOCOLATE
D: I don't know sir, this is his answering service, would you like me to have him paged?
C: CHEV
D: Fine, yes, please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can't call me back within the hour... got that? C
E: exasperated
C: HOCOLATE
D: Can you spell that for me sir?
N: She searches the food and carton strewn tabletop for something to write with.
C: CHEV
D: D-E-A-D. Chelios... got it?
C: CHOCOLATE
D: Yes sir...
C: CHEV
D: Thank you.
N: HEV hangs up. CHEV finds himself nodding off in the car ... The CAMERA ZOOMS back into his chest. This time it becomes COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT - we see his HEART BEAT SLOW DOWN: SOUND - BOOMING: ... LUB DUB, LUB DUB... The CAMERA SWOOSHES down to CHEV'S FOOT as he STEPS ON THE GAS... then back up to the HEART as the ADRENALINE CRANKS HIM UP... the BEATING SPEEDS UP - SOUND: ... LUBDUB, LUBDUB, LUBDUB..! ... and the CAMERA SNAPS back out to CHEV'S FACE as he seems to come to his senses. CHEV takes the cell. One-clicks, and sticks the phone in the cigarette adapter. Four rings. Finally someone picks up.
C: KAYLO
D: Hello?
E: O.S.
C: CHEV
D: Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night?
N: SPLIT SCREEN WITH:
S: INT KAYLO'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS
N: KAYLO is late 20's, slightly plump, hispanic, with gelled back curly hair. The room is unkempt. A woman in a robe shuffles by vaguely in the background, possibly his mother?
C: AYLO
D: h, what's up Chev?
C: CHEV
D: I said, where were you last night?
E: O.S.
N: IN A SCREEN WITHIN A SCREEN WE SEE HIM DRESSING UP IN DRAG, PUTTING ON LIPSTICK, FAKE TITS, THE WORKS, VOGUEING AT SOME FREAKY CLUB, ETC.

D: What?
C: CHEV
D: GETTING KILLED, YOU IDIOT!
C: KAYLO
D: What?
C: HEV
D: What? What? You heard me. That son of a bitch Ricky Verona.
C: AYLO
D: Ricky Verona ...
C: CHEV
D: Who would've thought that little bastard had the stones to come whack me in my own crib... it's inconceivable... and yet, here we are.
E: more to himself
C: KAYLO
D: Where are we?
N: Silence.
C: CHEV
D: I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen: you put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call me.
N: KAYLO puts his hands up in the air, dumbfounded.
C: CHEV
D: I'm going to get that little son of a bitch if it's the last thing I do... it may actually be the last thing I do, understand that? Copy me on that?
E: CONT'D
C: KAYLO
D: Ricky Verona?
C: CHEV
D: Find him!
N: Arriving at his destination CHEV clicks off, simultaneously closing KAYLO'S SCREEN IN A SCREEN, and shoves the phone into his shirt pocket as he screeches up the sidewalk.

D: EXT STREET, NEAR BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER
N: run down street in Inglewood. The BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE is a low lying pool hall/bar with a crude hand-painted sign reading BEER POOL DARTS. Motorcycles are parked out front. OLLER DOLLY from alongside CHEV'S car at high speed, break off and follow inside as CHEV parks haphazardly, rushes out and busts into the joint ...
S: INT. BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, CONTINUOUS
N: The continuous ROLLER DOLLY move takes us inside and KEEPS GOING. Eight or ten BROTHERS, some wearing motorcycle leathers, are scattered around the room, shooting stick, drinking, etc. CHEV BARGES IN, drawing a GLOK .45 from his coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black, hip, 30's, better dressed than the others - who is at the center of a group of BADASSES. efore anyone has time to react CHEV has the GUN PRESSED INTO ORLANDO'S FOREHEAD and is pushing him through the place into the bathroom. Everyone scatters and takes cover at the site of the GLOK; firearms appear. CHEV locks the door, SLAMS ORLANDO against the far wall and starts circling around him with the gun beaded on ORLANDO'S forehead.
C: CHEV
D: Where's Verona!!
E: out of his mind
C: ORLANDO
D: It's cool it's cool it's cool!
E: flipping out
C: CHEV
D: Talk!!
N: CHEV cocks the gun.
C: ORLANDO
D: I'm talking! What are we talking about?
C: CHEV
D: Don't fuck with me!!
C: ORLANDO
D: OK, nobody's fucking with you, just calm down ...
C: CHEV
D: DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER!
N: There's BANGING on the door. A BIKER yells from outside.
C: BIKER
D: O-land-o! What's up!
E: O.S.
C: ORLANDO
D: There's a white man with a gun in here, I would prefer that he not cap my ass, so please refrain from any sudden ass bullshit! to CHEV) Now you see that? I'm trying to help you here.
E: calling back
N: HEV starts to chill out.
C: CHEV
D: Look, I got to find Ricky Verona ...
C: ORLANDO
D: Why would I know where ... ?
C: CHEV
D: ... right, I know, you don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS INTO THAT TOILET!!
N: The DOOR BUSTS OPEN and a half dozen gun wielding BROTHERS crowd into the tiny room. otal mad chaos ensues, CHEV, ORLANDO and the BROTHERS packed in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else's head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming. The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of bloody violence. Finally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice.
C: ORLANDO
D: THE WHITE MAN IS COOL! THE WHITE MAN IS
C: COOL!
D: ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping.
C: ORLANDO
D: Can we all just get along? Can we?
E: CONT'D calmly
N: Beat. CHEV'S gun is still trained on ORLANDO'S head.
C: ORLANDO
D: Now Chevy here has something he would like to discuss. So we are going to discuss it. In a civilized manner. Chevy? I believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: Where's Verona.
C: ORLANDO
D: OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky Verona.
C: CHEV
D: You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me ...
E: starting to lose it again
N: He presses closer to ORLANDO ... the BROTHERS bristle ... the situation is close to blowing up again.
C: ORLANDO
D: Easy ... easy ... now things are beginning to clarify ... you see how that works? How discussion can lead to clarity?
N: HEV is running out of patience.
C: ORLANDO
D: Clearly you are operating under a false pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did not "pull the Anselmo job together." In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars.
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: That's not how I heard it.
C: ORLANDO
D: But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. So you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down. tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating.
N: hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.
C: CHEV
D: Alright.
N: The room lets out a collective exhale. The BROTHERS mutter amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit away, crazy bitch ass mother ...
C: ORLANDO
D: Thank you. That's what I'm talking about. That resembles civility.
N: LUB DUB ... LUB DUB ... LUB ... DUB CHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds him up and shoves him away.
C: ORLANDO
D: Shit dude, what's the matter with you?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch ...
C: ORLANDO
D: I understand that. You've made that point abundantly clear to all of us.
N: He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.
C: ORLANDO
D: Now what can I do to help you?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: Look, just give me some coke, OK? You got any coke?
N: ORLANDO gives him the look.
C: ORLANDO
D: OK, now you're insulting me.
C: CHEV
D: Come on, man, I know you got coke.
C: ORLANDO
D: You think every brother is carrying, is that it?
C: CHEV
D: Come on, I don't have time for this, just give me something ... I'm really dying here ...
C: ORLANDO
D: I can see that.
C: CHEV
D: No. You don't understand, I'm really fucking dying ... if I don't ... May I just have some coke, please?
E: losing it again
C: ORLANDO
D: So this is medicinal use coke, that's what you're telling me.
C: CHEV
D: That's right.
N: Beat.
C: ORLANDO
D: Well?
C: CHEV
D: hat?
C: ORLANDO
D: You got something for me, or what?
N: CHEV shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens, tosses it into the sink. He's visibly fading. ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS. CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point. CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The BROTHERS find this hilarious. ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust.
C: ORLANDO
D: Chevy ... come on, man...
E: CONT'D
N: We hear CHEV'S heart rate start to build, increase in volume. Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls, steadies himself. A new man.
C: CHEV
D: OK, that's good. That's good.
C: RLANDO
D: Oh that's good, right?
N: CHEV pounds rhythmically on chest, keeping time with his beating heart.
C: ORLANDO
D: hy you looking for Verona anyway?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me...
C: ORLANDO
D: Ah, so this is about the Don Kim situation.
C: CHEV
D: What do you know about it?
C: ORLANDO
D: I know you pulled the trigger.
C: CHEV
D: Of course I pulled the trigger! WHY WOULDN'T I PULL THE TRIGGER?!
E: flipping out
C: ORLANDO
D: O...kay...
N: Abruptly, CHEV'S HEART STOPS... his eyes go wide - he waits for it... LUB... ... waiting... DUB. ... and then it STARTS UP AGAIN, slow, erratic. CHEV is GHOST WHITE.
C: ORLANDO
D: Whoa, Chelios. You good, man?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: his shit's not working.
C: ORLANDO
D: Beg your pardon?
N: CHEV swoons, close to BLACKING OUT.
C: HEV
D: I think I know what I have to do.
C: ORLANDO
D: Well, a man's got to do what a man's got to do. Uhh... what exactly is it that you got to do?
E: shrugging beat
N: CHEV SNAPS to his senses.
C: HEV
D: Got to kick... some black... ass.
C: ORLANDO
D: What?
N: CHEV turns to the biggest, meanest looking BROTHER in the room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then, without warning, slams his head forward into the BROTHER'S face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all the other BROTHERS sprawling like tenpins.
C: RLANDO
D: There he goes again.
E: CONT'D
N: CHEV has a pool cue in his hands. He moves out into the hallway, eyes wild. OUND: CHEV's HEARTBEAT starts to rev up.
C: CHEV
D: Alright ... who wants white meat?
N: All hell breaks loose.
S: EXT OUTSIDE THE BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER
N: 1 21 A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it, single door closed. SUDDENLY THE WINDOW SMASHES OUTWARD; the two arms of one of the BROTHERS poke out through the bars as though he's been thrown into the window frame from inside. One hand holds a cue ball, which drops and hits the sidewalk. A second later THE DOOR BLOWS OFF IT'S HINGES as CHEV is tossed, upside down, through it to land on the cement in a jumble of glass and wood. The door falls on him. The BROTHERS chase him out into the street, shouting him down. STILL BRANDISHING THE POOL CUE, HE SOMEHOW HOLDS THEM OFF AS 22 HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE STREET, LAUGHING MANIACALLY, HEART POUNDING LIKE A

C: VERONA
D: eah, whatever. Look, just thought you'd like to know that I'm all about hooking up with that mystery girl you've been banging as soon as your ass is underground ... I forgot to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left for you...
C: CHEV 23A 23A
D: Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history.
N: CHEV checks the rearview mirror.
C: CHEV
D: Great.
E: CONT'D under his breath
N: Throughout the conversation his driving has gotten faster, 23B
C: 23B
D: more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to "PULL OVER" out of its intercom.
N: HEV goes evasive, leading the cop on a HIGH SPEED CHASE.
C: VERONA
D: arlito? That's funny, I guess you didn't know... Carlito's my boy now, we're tight.
C: CHEV
D: You haven't been tight since your brother fucked you in 3rd grade.
C: VERONA
D: lever. Snappy. Did you pretty good, didn't I, Chelios? Come on, you can admit it.
C: CHEV
D: We'll see.

D: Right, right, and the best part about it is...
N: CHEV'S phone BEEPS - incoming call.
C: HEV

C: OC MILES
D: Woah!
C: CHEV
D: You've got to do something for me, it feels so crazy, like it's in my blood ...
N: CHEV swerves wildly. Throughout the conversation we are tight on CHEV and DOC - the only idea we have about the chase occurring outside the car comes from CHEV'S wild steering, the sound of BURNING RUBBER AND SIRENS, and the few details flashing by in the background and reflected in the glass.
C: DOC MILES
D: Alright, slow down. You say you've been poisoned. Can you describe the symptoms?
C: CHEV
D: It's like... it's like... like I'm slowing down... like I'm caught in a tar pit...

S: EXT ROOFTOP OF CARLITO'S BUILDING, MINUTES LATER
N: EXTREME CU of a Fuente Fuente Opus X cigar, rich tendril of smoke curling through the air. As the hand holding the cigar brings it up for a drag the CAMERA pulls back, revealing CARLITO, an imposing 6'1", 225 lb. DOMINICAN in his late 40s. The CAMERA continues its move back, skimming over blue water, revealing an elaborate pool area on the rooftop. CARLITO is sitting by the pool in a velvet robe. Bodyguards roam the property and a beautiful, rock hard BLACK WOMAN suns on the deck. Still in the same shot, pulling back, CARLITO puts down the cigar, stands up and dives into the pool. The camera drops down below the water level, and CARLITO swims right up to it for a CLOSE-UP. CARLITO'S POV - We are under water swimming towards the edge of the pool. As we look up, we see a water-distorted figure above the water, looking down into the pool. The classic shot made famous in The GRADUATE and used a thousand times since ... only this time the guy outside the pool JUMPS IN. t's CHEV, fully dressed. He meets CARLITO face to face underwater and points up with his index finger. We CUT TO CARLITO'S reaction. He follows CHEV up. heir heads rise just above the water, like heads on a platter. Several jittery BODYGUARDS stand at the edge of the pool, guns drawn. With a simple motion of his hand, CARLITO calms them.

N: They stare each other down. LUBDUB ... LUB ... DUB ... LUB ... DUB ...
C: CHEV
D: orget it, I'm out of here.
N: CHEV climbs out of the pool. CARLITO NARROWS HIS EYES, watching him leave. The BODYGUARD motions to follow, CARLITO signals him off. CHEV passes a black HELICOPTER sitting on a small, hard-rubbered heli-pad. CARLITO'S POV - from a distance we see CHEV knocking over furniture and BREAKING GLASS on his way out. CARLITO'S POV descends beneath the water - his breath releases.

A VALET approaches him and CHEV gets in his face, FLASHING MURDEROUS TEETH and shoving him away, hopping up and down to keep the heart pounding ... he heads over to the cab waiting out front. The same ARAB CABBIE is waiting inside.

C: HEV
D: AL QEADA! AL QEADA!

N: 3 43 KAYLO pays for his food at a leisurely pace - he's at a little place across the street from CHARLIE O'S - and skulks out onto the street, trying too hard to be inconspicuous.
S: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
N: Meanwhile, in the second screen, CHEV is blasting along at high speed, off the freeway, through downtown, and right to the corner of 3rd and Flower, where he leaves the taxi idling in a red zone and gets out. As KAYLO turns the corner, the two SPLIT SCREENS meet up - he45 and CHEV run right into each other. HEV pulls KAYLO around the corner, out of sight of the restaurant.

S: INT CHARLIE O'S, SAME TIME
N: ALEX is in his usual booth, making lecherous smalltalk with a 40ish WAITRESS in a short skirt and fishnet stockings, as CHEV, still drying, hair all fucked up and walking erratically, enters the restaurant. Everyone turns to look at the crazy man, nervously. HEV walks doggedly right by ALEX, staring straight ahead, not letting on that he knows he's there. ALEX watches him pass in disbelief.
C: WAITRESS
D: What was that?
C: ALEX
D: I just saw a ghost.
N: CHEV disappears through the swinging doors to the kitchen. The MAIRTRE'D has the phone in his hands, ready to dial the cops, but ALEX motions to him to chill. He'll take care of it. He gets up and follows in CHEV'S footsteps.
S: INT CHARLIE O'S KITCHEN, SAME TIME
N: ALEX enters the kitchen. The COOKS all hustle by him - they want no part of this. CHEV is nowhere to be seen. LEX continues through the kitchen with a distinct lack of caution - everyone's been afraid of the big man all his life - drawing a gun from inside his coat as he goes. He passes a butcher block, a hacked up roast, a conspicuous BUTCHER KNIFE. Turning a corner, he notices the back door swinging slowly closed. He advances. The back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and tries to peer around it into the alley. Just then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the BUTCHER KNIFE. efore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and neatly cuts off ALEX'S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and into the alley.
S: EXT ALLEY, SAME TIME
N: ALEX crumples in shock, holding his abbreviated arm out in front of his face. He tries to talk, or scream, but all that comes out is a wheezing sound. CHEV follows him out into the alley, brandishing the BUTCHER KNIFE, heartrate slamming.
C: CHEV

D: Doing your mother like an Iraqi prisoner, you bitch.
E: anger gradually overcoming the shock
C: CHEV
D: Nice ... wonder how many steaks I could get out of you ... LEX rolls onto his knees, and with a burst of energy throws himself at CHEV. HE SMASHES CHEV INTO THE ALLEY WALL and lands on him with his full weight.
N: CHEV is pinned. ALEX, enraged, attempts with some success to strangle him with his remaining hand. CHEV struggles in futility, heart hammering. It seems hopeless ... ... until KAYLO appears behind ALEX with a ROLLING PIN and brings it down on his skull with a LOUD CRACK. ALEX rises up, staggering, and advances on KAYLO, who drops the ROLLING PIN and cowers amidst the trash cans. CHEV gets to his feet, pulls out his gun, puts it to the back of ALEX'S head. CHEV pulls the trigger twice. CLICK. CLICK.
C: CHEV
D: WHAT??
E: CONT'D
N: He tosses it away and stumbles to the back door of the restaurant as ALEX proceeds to beat KAYLO down with a trashcan, swinging it one handed. HEV picks up ALEX'S disconnected hand, which is still clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. He uses ALEX'S finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him away. ALEX hits the ground with a THUD.
C: CHEV
D: Jesus ... nothing's easy ...
E: CONT'D
N: He pries the gun from ALEX'S cold, dead fingers, shoves it in his pocket and tosses the hand to a disgusted KAYLO, who tries to get away from it ...

N: The sliding doors to the ER swoosh open as a gurney is wheeled in by paramedics. CHEV walks quickly in behind them, a complete wreck, ignoring all the activity, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. He checks a sign on the wall for directions. An arrow points toward the PHARMACY. He follows it.
S: INT HOSPITAL PHARMACY, MOMENTS LATER
N: CHEV cuts off an OLD MAN with a walker making his way to the counter. He runs his hand through his freaked out hair, trying to straighten it out. The PHARMACIST, a cynical girl, mid-20s, with thick horn rimmed glasses, regards him blankly.

N: CHEV looks from the kid to the display and back, then through the glass window, where the PHARMACIST is talking to someone on the telephone, looking out at him suspiciously. He picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets out of there. The OLD MAN gives him a sour look; CHEV makes him FLINCH with a sudden jerk toward him.
S: INT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL, MOMENTS LATER
N: CHEV wanders through the trauma ward, trying to look inconspicuous, avoiding eye contact, knocking things over, trying doors, inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray, tossing the empty bottles, eyes watering. He rounds a corner and freezes in his tracks: three COPS are at the admissions counter ... a NURSE is gesturing in CHEV'S direction. They look up toward him. He ducks back into the corridor, finds a recovery room and slips in.
S: INT HOSPITAL ROOM, MOMENTS LATER
N: The room is quiet, save for the steady labored wheezing of an OLD MAN in the only bed. The OLD MAN'S eyes stare vacantly at the ceiling - CHEV can't tell if he's asleep or awake. He watches the OLD MAN for a stolen moment, hypnotized ... .. then glances over at the half open closet.
S: INT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL, MOMENTS LATER
N: The COPS come up on the corridor where CHEV disappeared. They advance, hands on weapons, checking each room. hey reach CHEV'S room. The door is slightly ajar. One of the cops pushes it open with his foot. The OLD MAN is there, motionless. No sign of CHEV. The COPS continue down the hall. Behind them, from the door they checked, CHEV tiptoes out wearing a blue hospital johnnie, tied in the back with his ass hanging out, trying to blend in. One of the COPS notices this.

S: INT EMERGENCY ROOM, MOMENTS LATER
N: The busy ER is buzzing with activity. CHEV looks around desperately. The COPS are right on his tail. Suddenly the entrance doors BURST OPEN ... a patient is wheeled in at a dead run by a small group of emergency TECHS, all shouting instructions back and forth and barking at people to get out of the way as they race toward the far corridor. The FAT MAN on the gurney has his shirt open ... he's pale, glassy eyed and lathered in sweat ... they have the DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES out ... ehind the gurney a RESIDENT pushes a CRASH CART along with them ... the crash cart houses the DEFIBRILLATOR and various supplies ...

N: The group is galloping down the long corridor toward the elevators that connect to the O.R. ... three DOCS, the RESIDENT, CHEV and the FAT MAN on the gurney ... the COPS in hot pursuit, trying to get a bead on CHEV. CHEV is holding his gun to the RESIDENT'S head while pushing him and the cart forward. The RESIDENT blubbers in panic. The DOCS, in all the confusion, haven't noticed CHEV yet.
C: CHEV
D: You've got epinephrine on this cart! I want that shit!
N: TECH 1 He's dropping! Stand by to defibrillate! The gurney slows down and the cart, shoved forward by CHEV, crashes into it. Bodies fly, shit spills everywhere. The FAT MAN lets out a groan, makes EYE CONTACT with CHEV.

N: CHEV nods weakly. The RESIDENT, on his hands and knees, starts digging through the supplies spilled all over the floor. The COPS, sensing weakness, start to tense. CHEV snaps out of it momentarily.
C: CHEV
D: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
N: The RESIDENT approaches him cautiously, on his knees, holding out a handful of small white boxes.
C: CHEV
D: Give me that.
E: CONT'D
N: He snatches them, cradling them against his stomach, and backs up past the DOCS toward the elevator just as the chime sounds and the doors slide open. He tosses the boxes inside. The FAT MAN lets out another agonized groan.
C: AT MAN
D: ... asshole...
N: CHEV points the gun at him.
C: CHEV
D: Not going to tell you again.
N: He grabs a DEFIBRILLATOR paddle out of TECH 2's trembling hands and holds it to his chest.
C: CHEV
D: Now juice me.
E: CONT'D to the RESIDENT
C: RESIDENT
D: You ... but ... I ...
C: CHEV
D: I haven't got all day, just do it, will you?
E: weakly, not much left
N: The RESIDENT flips a switch on the crash cart and the thing begins to charge ... CHEV holds the paddle to his chest with one hand, the gun out with the other ... finally ... ZAPPP!!!! CHEV flies backwards, bouncing off the wall like a pinball. The COPS leap forward, trying to take advantage, but CHEV pops back up, wired and wild eyed.
C: CHEV
D: GET DOWN, ASSHOLES!
E: CONT'D
N: He FIRES ANOTHER WARNING SHOT into the ceiling and leaps into the elevator as the doors close behind him.
S: INT ELEVATOR, GOING DOWN, MOMENTS LATER
N: CHEV collapses on the floor of the elevator. He fumbles with the white boxes the RESIDENT handed him and comes up with a SYRINGE.
C: HEV
D: OK ... needles, hate needles ...
N: He rubs his arm, feeling for a nice vein, squirts a few drops from the tip of the needle and pops the thing right in ... pushes the plunger ALL THE WAY, plucks it out and tosses it in the corner. CHEV sits patiently against the wall, staring blankly straight ahead. Suddenly a curious look comes over him.
C: CHEV
D: How much of this stuff did he say to take?
E: CONT'D
N: We hear CHEV'S HEARTBEAT start to speed/volume up - FAST. His eyes widen.
C: CHEV
D: Woah. Woah. Woah.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly he jumps straight up in the air.
C: CHEV
D: OH SHIT!
E: CONT'D
N: He starts to HOP AROUND WILDLY like a monkey in an electrified cage. The bell chimes and the elevator doors open.
S: INT HOSPITAL LOBBY, THE NEXT MOMENT
N: CHEV BLASTS OUT OF THE ELEVATOR and out the front doors of the hospital like a ball out of a cannon.
S: EXT CITY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
N: CHEV is hoofing it like FORREST GUMP on SPEEDBALL. We hear sirens ... a group of squad cars flash by behind him, heading toward the hospital ... neither they nor CHEV see one another.
S: MONTAGE: EXT CITY STREETS - DAY
N: He runs what seems like eight miles.
S: EXT CITY STREETS- DAY LATER
N: We pick him up, real-time, still running. SOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. He answers without slowing down.

E: getting into it
N: The LADY in the seat next to DOC is aghast.
C: CHEV
D: Urinary sphincter ... check ...
C: DOC MILES
D: Maybe you can get a hold of some vicadin ... you still at the hospital?
C: CHEV
D: Negative.
C: DOC MILES
D: Maybe some weed ... I don't know ...
C: CHEV
D: Check.
C: DOC MILES
D: Well, that shit should be out of your system in a half hour or so, if you live that long ... this air phone is costing me a fortune ... look, I'll be in LA in twenty minutes. I'll call you when I hit the ground.

D: Copy.

D: You're a good kid, Chev. Nice knowing you.
E: sincere
C: CHEV
D: Copy. Out.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT STORE WINDOW, DAY
N: ut DOC MILES is already a distant memory ... CHEV lets the phone drop from his ear without hanging up ... .. as he comes up on a department store window where a crowd has gathered to watch a wall of TV's, all playing the same thing ... .. he slows to a stop, joining the crowd ... he face on the TV is his - more or less - an exaggerated black and white POLICE SKETCH, simian browed and thick lipped. He looks like a serial rapist.
C: ANCHOR
D: Police have declined to release the name of the West Hollywood man they say is still at large on a citywide rampage that has left one man dead, dozens injured and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage in its smoking, bloody wake.
E: V.O.
N: SWITCH TO: A HELICOPTER VIEW OF CHEV DRIVING HIS CAR INTO FOX HILLS MALL. BACK TO:
S: EXT STORE WINDOW, SAME TIME
C: 65A 65A NCHOR
D: However, Eyewitness News has learned that the suspect is a professional killer with ties to organized crime and an extensive police record. He is considered armed and highly dangerous.
E: V.O.
N: A GUY standing next to CHEV glances sidelong at him. CHEV turns to meet his eyes. The GUY regards him in a stupor, then looks down: CHEV's hospital johnnie is sticking straight out in front, ass hanging out the back, a gun in his left hand, cell phone in his right. he GUY looks back up at CHEV'S poker face, gulps, and turns back to the wall of screens. The broadcast cuts from tape back to the live ANCHOR.
C: ANCHOR
D: We want to get you back to our regularly scheduled programming, but keep it tuned right here to ABC for continuing coverage of this bizarre story as it unfolds.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNOUNCER
D: We now return you to "Dr. Phil" ...
E: V.O. over network graphic
N: The TV cuts to a talk show in progress. Rather than disperse, the small crowd stays hypnotically glued to the tube. We see in their eyes that everyone is going into that TV alpha state thing ... CHEV shakes his head, snaps out of it. His HEARTBEAT, barely audible during the broadcast, swells back to full volume, beating like a jackrabbit's. e looks around and spots a COP on a motorcycle, waiting at a stoplight.
S: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TV STORE
N: With a last look at the TV drones he breaks from the crowd and goes into stealth mode, darting from car to car in an exaggerated ninja crouch, trying to sneak up on the COP. He comes up behind him, transfers his gun and cell phone to one hand, and - heart POUNDING - reaches stealthily for the COP'S holster with the other. CAR HORNS BLARE as motorists attempt to warn the COP, who flinches and whips around at the noise - but it's too late: CHEV has the gun. He begins to hop around maniacally, taunting the COP, as everyone panics and tries to reverse out of the traffic snarl, SLAMMING INTO FENDERS, driving up onto the sidewalk, etc.
C: CHEV
D: You want it? You want this?
E: tossing the gun up and catching it
N: he COP jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but jerks back when CHEV catches the gun. CHEV holds the gun up like a fetch stick, gluing the COP'S eyes, then flings it 40 feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain. he COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. He kicks up the stand and REVS IT.
C: COP
D: You son of a bitch!
N: The COP makes a dive for CHEV, grabbing him by the waist as the bike jerks forward. HEV starts to burn the bike out as the COP hangs on, dragging. SMOKE ERUPTS; black bits of rubber spray like buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT, kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing, dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails out.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT ROAD, MONTAGE, 30 SECONDS LATER
N: EVERYBODY'S TALKING" by Harry Nilsson BEGINS. CHEV cruises in an out of traffic and people like a Sunday drive, ignoring traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians. (We speed ramp about 20% to the beat of the song - an undercrank of about 18fps.) He's so jacked up and delusional he decides to try a BARE- ASSED "ELEVATOR" ON THE SIDEWALK. From the rear pegs at about 30 mph he JUMPS UP TO THE GAS TANK, feet first, STANDS STRAIGHT UP ON THE MOVING BIKE and puts his hands out to his sides in a Jesus Christ pose, flashing a silhouette in the sun. His HEART POUNDS as he flies by crowds of astonished bystanders ... .. and CRASHES straight into a patio restaurant full of people. CHEV flips through the air and lands in a cacophony of overturned tables and busted dishes. A table spins like a coin at his feet.
C: END: "EVERYBODY'S TALKING"
D: EXT RESTAURANT, MOMENTS LATER 9 69 Stunned silence hangs in the air; a few food-covered people wander around in dazed shock. CHEV'S arm, hand still clutching his cell phone, sticks out from under a table. The phone starts to ring:
N: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. From under the table we see CHEV'S eyes blink as he comes to his senses. He shakes off the debris, struggles to his feet and clicks to answer the phone.
C: CHEV
D: Yeah.
C: EVE
D: Hey. Did you try to call?
E: O.S. sleepy
N: CHEV lets his arm drop to his side, stares blankly at nothing, then brings it back up.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT EVE'S APARTMENT, SAME TIME
N: A room suffused in amber filtered sunlight. EVE, a non- traditionally adorable strawberry blond in her mid 20's, yawn- stretches with the phone cradled between ear and bare shoulder.
C: CHEV
D: You've been home all day?
E: O.S.
C: EVE
D: I was sleeping in.
C: CHEV
D: You were sleeping in, that's great, Eve ... super great ... you all rested now?
E: O.S.

C: 69A 69A CHEV
D: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Listen, I've been fatally poisoned, there's probably a psychopath heading over there to torture and kill you as we speak, but don't bother getting out of bed, I'll be there in a flash ... Maybe you could fry me up a waffle or something, kay?
E: holding it together
C: VE
D: Sure, come on over, I'll be here.
E: O.S. oblivious
C: CHEV
D: Right, you'll be there, OK.
N: CHEV clicks off. ll the while he's been wrestling the wasted motorcycle from the wreckage. It's smoking, leaking oil. He shakes his head at a dumfounded waiter, holding up the phone like - "Can you believe this?" ... then climbs on the SPUTTERING BIKE and drives off.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. VERONA'S CRIB - DAY
N: CU: VERONA stares straight down at the CAMERA. REVERSE: VERONA'S POV - ALEX'S severed hand, frozen stiff in a trigger-pulling position. VERONA looks up at his CREW, gathered nervously around the room; lunatic schizo-cycles through a half dozen emotions before arriving at something resembling off-hand, casual, I'll have the #2 Super Size with a Diet Coke.
C: VERONA
D: Right, so... let's go get the bitch.
N: UT TO:
S: INT EVE'S APARTMENT, 4 MINUTES LATER
N: EVE'S pad is nothing like CHEV'S. It's all cats and incense, warm natural light, a scratchy Van Morrison LP playing on a real record player. VE, in a cotton nightgown, is in the kitchen, attempting some bit of microwave programming, punching random buttons and getting herself worked up.
C: VE
D: I hate you ...
E: to the microwave
N: Five BANGS on the door barely distract her.
C: EVE
D: Just a minute.
E: CONT'D
N: More BANGS, insistent.
C: EVE
D: Alright, alright, Jesus ...
E: CONT'D
N: She gives up on the microwave, goes to answer the door.
C: EVE
D: ... calm down, what the hell ...
E: CONT'D
N: It's CHEV. He's dressed in a blue Adidas JOGGING SUIT - long sleeve jacket, warm up pants with buttons down the side, the works. He couldn't look more out of place in EVE'S mellow apartment. He's bathed in sweat, wild-eyed, hair slicked back like GORDON GEKKO.
C: EVE
D: Oh. My. God.
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: Hey doll.
N: He pulls her toward him and kisses her. She accepts the kiss gratefully enough with her mouth, but holds both hands out to her sides as if touching the JOGGING SUIT would kill her. Without making eye contact, he breaks away and pushes into the apartment, looking around everywhere, paranoid.
C: EVE
D: Is this your new look or something?
C: CHEV
D: That's right. You into it?
C: EVE
D: It's ... completely appalling. Very you, Chev.
C: CHEV
D: Thank you.
N: He checks into the bedroom, satisfies himself that it's empty.
C: EVE
D: Are you looking for my other boyfriend?
C: CHEV
D: You haven't turned on the TV today, right?
E: ignoring this
C: EVE
D: No. Why?
C: CHEV
D: Didn't think so. Listen, we've got to get out of here.
C: EVE
D: What are you talking about? Don't be such a freak.
N: CHEV goes to the window, peaks through the curtains.
C: EVE
D: Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you change the clock on the microwave?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: What?
C: EVE
D: I never changed it back.
C: CHEV
D: The microwave.
C: EVE
D: Yeah. I never changed it back. You know, daylight savings time.
C: HEV
D: I bought you some flowers, but they got fucked up on the way over here.
C: EVE
D: That's sweet. Are you OK? You look like you're on drugs or something.
C: CHEV
D: You love me, right?
C: EVE
D: Yes.
C: CHEV
D: Then I need you to do something for me.
C: EVE
D: What is it? What's wrong?
C: CHEV
D: I need you to put some clothes on and come with me right now.
C: EVE
D: But ... I ...
C: CHEV
D: I'll change the clock on the microwave.
C: EVE
D: OK.
N: Confused, she pads off to the bedroom to change. CHEV goes into the kitchen. He peeks out the kitchen window, looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up and punches two buttons. EXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18- wheeler being dragged on it's side through a cathedral. HEV'S vision starts to blur. He slumps forward, head pressed against the microwave, trying to hold himself up. We hear his HEART skip, hang for a long moment, then thud again, heavily.
C: HEV
D: That shit's wearing off ...
E: to himself
C: EVE
D: Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on if you want to make one.
E: O.S. calling to him
C: CHEV
D: Great, great ...
E: calling back
N: He lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting to smoke. He takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND PRESSES THE THING CLOSED. OUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE. e screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping up and down.
C: EVE
D: You're so stressed out, do you want some pot?
E: O.S.
C: CHEV
D: Yes. No! ... thanks ...
E: fighting to get the words out
N: The waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a ribbon in her hair.
C: EVE
D: What's the matter?
C: CHEV
D: Nothing ... burned my hand ...
E: holding it in
N: She comes up to him, tries to pry his hand out from under his arm. E
C: VE
D: Oh my God, are you OK? Let me see...
C: CHEV
D: It's nothing... don't worry about it... let's get out of here ...
C: EVE
D: Come on, let me see ...
C: CHEV
D: I SAID I'M OK, CAN WE JUST LEAVE??!!
C: EVE
D: That was just totally uncalled for.
E: coldly
C: CHEV
D: I'm sorry ... look, can we just ...
E: exasperated
C: EVE
D: Fine.
N: She turns, grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a huff. HEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better look. A SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each one has a right hand tucked into his blazer - they're PACKING. BACK TO:
C: CHEV
D: Shit!
E: under his breath
N: He flies out the door after EVE - the door swings shut behind him.
S: INT. HALLWAY, EVE'S BUILDING - DAY
N: CHEV comes up behind EVE, grabs her by the shoulders and turns her around.
C: CHEV
D: I'm parked out back.
N: He glances over his shoulder. Through the glass SECURITY DOOR he sees HOOD #1 coming up the front steps. EVE stops suddenly in front of her door - CHEV practically PILES into her.
C: EVE
D: Oh darn... the thing.
N: She starts to dig through her purse for her keys.
C: CHEV
D: The thing. What thing.
N: The HOOD tries the front door - LOCKED.
C: EVE
D: The waffle thing. I forgot to turn it off.
E: unlocking the door
N: he opens the door and walks in. CHEV tries to speak, coughs up some unintelligible stacato nonsense.
S: EXT. FRONT PORCH, EVE'S BUILDING - DAY
N: The HOOD runs his fingers down the directory list to: E. LYDON - 101 ... and then across to the KEYPAD, PEEL-AND-STICK labeled: 7 ENTER + APT. # TO DIAL
S: INT. HALLWAY, EVE'S BUILDING - DAY
N: 6 76 CHEV is SLACK-JAWED. Inside the apartment, the PHONE BEGINS TO RING.
C: VE
D: Alright, alright...!
E: O.S.
N: CHEV shakes his head in disbelief; steels himself - then turns and walks quickly down the hall to the front door.
S: INT. EVE'S APARTMENT, CONTINUOUS
N: Flustered, EVE picks up the phone.
C: EVE
D: Hello?
S: EXT. FRONT PORCH, EVE'S BUILDING - DAY
N: The door SLAMS OPEN. The HOOD whirls to see CHEV, grim as a motherfucker, SIX INCHES FROM HIS FACE. He scrambles for his gun - OO LATE. CHEV'S hand flashes forward, PALM connecting with the BRIDGE OF THE NOSE - dropping him instantly.
C: VE
D: Hello? Hello? Alright, very funny...
E: O.S. through the intercom
N: The HOOD drops to his knees, eyes rolling back in his head, blood rushing from his nose. CHEV glances quickly around for witnesses - then backs into the hallway, letting the door swing shut behind him.
S: INT. HALLWAY, EVE'S BUILDING - DAY
N: EVE pops out.
C: VE
D: I hate that...
N: CHEV is waiting by the door, blocking her view of the front entrance, smiling somewhat crazily.
C: CHEV
D: You trying to burn down the building?
N: She gives him a look, then turns and heads down the hall. CHEV hustles after her.
C: CHEV
D: Whoa whoa whoa...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. REAR EXIT, EVE'S BUILDING - DAY
N: he building opens out back into a small parking area. Trash bins line the brick wall, ready for pick up. CHEV and EVE are leaving when CHEV sees the other HOOD coming around the corner, LESS THAN TEN FEET AWAY. CHEV grabs the back of EVE'S purse and turns it upside down, spilling the contents all over the concrete. She spins around, just missing C sight of the HOOD.
C: HEV
D: Aww, damn it, I'm sorry baby...
C: EVE
D: Nice one.
E: irritated
N: She drops down to gather up her things, as the HOOD comes fully around the corner and MEETS EYES with CHEV. ithout hesitation, CHEV hurdles EVE and catches the HOOD'S wrist as he pulls out his GUN.
C: VE
D: I swear to God, Chev, I don't know what you're on these days but it is not working for you...
E: CONT'D oblivious
N: CHEV wrestles himself around the HOOD, keeping the gun at a distance with one hand, his other hand cupped over the HOOD'S mouth, head-locking him. Their legs interlock, jostling for leverage. he GUN drifts down toward EVE - CHEV wrenches it up as THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES. SILENCER. The shot whizzes over EVE'S head and through a nearby window: PLINK!
S: INT. SENIOR CITIZEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: A PARAKEET in a cage by the window disappears in a puff of feathers. 2 82
S: EXT. REAR EXIT, EVE'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
N: From overhead, the CAMERA CORKSCREWS CLOCKWISE as CHEV wrenches the HOOD'S neck COUNTERCLOCKWISE, snapping it.
C: EVE
D: You know, I could use a little help here.
N: CHEV shoves the HOOD'S body into a dumpster just as EVE turns... CHEV snatches up the first thing he sees - a grime encrusted plastic SHOWER CAP - and holds it up lamely.
C: CHEV
D: Is this yours?
N: EVE rolls her eyes, looks around.
C: EVE
D: Where's your car?
C: CHEV
D: My car. Actually... I took a cab.
S: EXT. DOWN THE BLOCK - DAY
N: A POLICE MOTORCYCLE is tipped over on a lawn, coughing up black smoke, spewing oil. A crowd of Mexicans are gathered around, gaping. lames start to SHOOT UP from the motorcycle; THE CROWD SCATTERS, ducking for cover.
S: EXT L.A. CHINATOWN, 8 MINUTES LATER
N: 4 84 MONTAGE: Chinatown is bustling with activity. Vendors haggle ... workers hustle down the sidewalk with baskets of chickens, sides of meat ... tourists wander ... motorists argue and punch their horns ... and the lunch hour crowd converges on a hundred eateries ... e hear a million HEARTBEATS, old, young ... even fast ticking chicken heartbeats, all overlapping, blending together in a swelling din of live things. The voyeuristic CAMERA picks CHEV and EVE up through the crowd. CHEV is wearing DARK GLASSES to go with his 80's hair and jogger.
C: VE
D: You're embarrassing.
C: CHEV
D: You know, I didn't have a lot of time to pick this out ...
C: EVE
D: Hm. So why are we here?
S: INT NOODLE HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER
N: CHEV sits across from EVE in a tiny restaurant. An equally tiny VIETNAMESE WOMAN brings them menus. CHEV pulls a little bottle of NAS-ALL out of his pocket and SNORTS the entire thing, grotesquely, at the table. It doesn't help much. He shakes out his head, bangs his fist on the table and sits up in his chair.
C: CHEV

E: holding his fingers up to indicate quotation marks MORE
C: CONTINUED: CHEV
D: "This isn't going to be easy" ... as they say ...

D: Last night was a job like a hundred others. A high dollar hit. Nothing special.
E: V.O.
N: CHEV walks up behind him, gun drawn to the back of KIM'S head... cocks the hammer back. DON KIM spins around in shock, the same reaction we saw in the SCENE 1 FLASHBACK - FROZEN, SAUCER-EYED. HEV'S eyes steel... his finger tightens...
C: HEV
D: And then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range... ilence hangs heavy in the room... CHEV holds the gun to DON KIM'S head, paralyzed with indecision.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: DON KIM
D: Well? What are you waiting for?
N: With a last GRIMACE like even he can't believe what he's doing, CHEV lets his GUN HAND DROP slowly to his side.
C: HEV
D: Congratulations.

D: Did I win something?
C: CHEV

D: I don't understand.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT CHINATOWN, OUTDOOR PLAZA, MOMENTS LATER
N: EVE storms out of the restaurant, letting the door slam behind her. CHEV follows, staggering like a drunk man. He catches up to her and grabs her arm.

D: Eve... baby... please!
N: She spins on him.
C: EVE
D: Mob hits, Chev? Chinese poison? Do you know how ridiculous you sound? If you're going to break up with me, at least you can tell me the truth.
C: CHEV
D: You think it sounds crazy? How do you think I feel - I've gotta live this shit...
N: ust then the CAMERA SLAMS THROUGH CHEV'S TRANSPARENT CHEST - his HEART seems to GRIND DOWN and STALL, MID-PUMP, as the POISON'S PROGRESS moves another clock tick forward. he CAMERA pulls violently out of CHEV'S chest cavity - he looks like someone just FIRED A CANNONBALL INTO HIS GUT... face white as a dinner plate... It's the worst we've seen him yet.
C: VE
D: Oh my God, Chev... what's the matter with you?
N: He looks around like a drowning man. People everywhere, but starting to disperse as lunch hour dwindles. The world starts to SPIN.

D: You're insane. You're like some adrenaline junkie with no soul.
C: CHEV
D: Save me, Eve. Save my life.
N: CHEV starts feeling up EVE'S ass.
C: EVE
D: Stop it!
N: She SLUGS HIM IN THE MOUTH. His head snaps back; he comes up holding his lip.
C: EVE
D: Oh my God, Chev!
E: CONT'D
N: She reaches instinctively to comfort him and he lunges forward, tearing at her dress. hey roll around on the ground, scratching and clawing at one another. A curious crowd gathers round. EVE starts to flip out, SCREAMING AND POUNDING on him with her fists like a crazy woman. ext thing you know she's kissing and biting his mouth, breathless, still pounding with her fists.
C: EVE
D: You filthy animal ...
E: CONT'D
N: She reaches down and starts fumbling with his pants. He helps. The onlookers' eyes widen, moms covering the kids' faces.
C: EVE
D: Take me right here in front of everyone.
E: CONT'D
N: CHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to pick up. He lifts her dress and positions himself on top of her. EVE is completely out of her head, eyes closed, legs up in the air like a porn star.
C: VE
D: That's it... do it ...
E: CONT'D
N: CHEV thrusts.
C: VE
D: Come on, put it in me...
E: CONT'D
N: He thrusts again. EVE's eyes pop open.
C: EVE
D: What are you waiting for?
E: CONT'D
N: CHEV looks down at his equipment, then up at EVE, helplessly.
C: EVE
D: Tell me you're joking. Now you can't get it up?
E: CONT'D incredulously
C: CHEV
D: I'll fucking get it up!
E: determined
N: With a surge of energy he lifts her off the ground, drags her over to a newspaper machine on the street - the crowd parts to let them through - and bends her over it. He tries again to enter her.
C: EVE
D: God damn it, Chev ...!
C: CHEV
D: Shut up!
N: He starts to SPANK her. She responds with a moan. A certain portion of the crowd spontaneously breaks into applause. CHEV picks up the pace. EVE begins making primal cries. busload of JAPANESE GIRLS pulls up - tourists in matching red uniforms - gaping out the window with slack jawed amazement. ith the crowd cheering and traffic stopped, CHEV gets a shot of adrenaline and goes for broke. EVE shrieks like a banshee as he enters her.
C: CHEV
D: I'M STILL ALIVE! I'M STILL ALIVE!!!
E: CONT'D
N: CHEV'S HEARTBEAT is slamming, he's really giving it to her, making full eye contact with the busload of tourists the entire time. CHEV doubles his efforts, desperately fighting for the climax, when ... BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM.
C: HEV
D: What was that?
E: CONT'D
C: EVE
D: Oh God... Oh God... yes...

S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, SAME TIME
N: CU of KAYLO'S face.
C: KAYLO
D: I've got Verona.
N: We see that KAYLO is duct taped to an office chair in what appears to be an old warehouse, knife to his neck, held by unseen captors. He's been badly beaten up.
C: 6A 86A
D: EXT STREET, CHINATOWN, SAME TIME
N: CHEV is still going through the motions with EVE, but his attention has shifted 100% to the voice on the phone.

D: Kaylo?
C: KAYLO
D: I've got Verona, man.
E: V.O.

C: KAYLO
D: OK, Chevy ...
E: close to breaking into tears
C: CHEV
D: Out.
N: END SPLIT SCREEN.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, MOMENTS LATER
N: KAYLO looks up at his captors, miserably, as the phone clicks off. The CAMERA instantly flashes down to a low wide angle, looking straight up as a bag is thrown over KAYLO'S head and two unidentifiable men close in on him, lifting the chair off the ground ... then takes its time moving slowly down to reveal KAYLO'S feet, bicycling wildly, then twitching, finally just dangling ... both in fishnet and high heeled pumps. One pump falls to the concrete as KAYLO goes still
S: EXT STREET, CHINATOWN, SAME TIME
C: 86D 86D
D: CHEV turns his attention back to EVE.
C: CHEV
D: I have to go. Please understand.

D: No. Chev. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
N: CHEV spots a flash of blue - COPS making their way through the crowd.
C: CHEV

N: He breaks away running, leaving EVE stranded half naked in the street, holding her torn dress up amidst a sea of gaping Chinese.
C: EVE
D: YOU'LL BURN IN HELL FOR THIS!!!

C: CHEV
D: I'll call you!
E: shouting back, voice trailing off
S: INT CHINATOWN CAB, 5 MINUTES LATER

C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: Hey.
E: heavy accent
N: e adjusts the mirror to get a look at CHEV. CHEV looks like hell - cold sweat, woozy, glass-eyed.
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: Hey man. What's the matter with you? You a crackhead?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: Right... just step on it, alright?
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: Hey, you not gonna die in my cab, crackhead.
N: The HAITIAN CABBIE opens up his glove compartment and takes something out. CHEV'S eyes widen. A gun?
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: I got something for you.
E: CONT'D
N: As the CABBIE turns around CHEV experiences a FLASH HALLUCINATION: The CABBIE'S face is painted like a PSYCHEDELIC VOODOO SKULL in GLOWING BLACK LIGHT PAINT. He is grinning crazily. CHEV flinches in horror, but just like that the CABBIE is back to normal. He hands CHEV a vial of liquid.
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: You drink this Haitian shit, crackhead. This right here is some hardcore shit. Made from plant shit.
E: CONT'D
C: CHEV
D: Nice.
E: laughing
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: What are you laughing at? Look at this!
E: irritated
N: He flexes a HUGE BICEP.
C: AITIAN CABBIE
D: You see that? That's what a man looks like, crackhead. That's the power. Now look at you.
E: CONT'D
N: HEV narrows his eyes at the CABBIE, then shakes his head.
C: CHEV
D: What the hell.
N: He twists open the little vial and downs it in one gulp.
C: CHEV
D: grimacing) Tastes like ass.
E: CONT'D
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: That's right, devil. You wait.
N: CHEV rolls his eyes and leans against the door, face pressed against the window glass. raffic flashes by at high speed then cuts to slo mo: The CAMERA ramps down to 120 f.p.s as a car rolls by CHEV'S taxi. A LITTLE BOY who could be younger version of CHEV himself rides in the back seat. They make eye contact as the cars cross paths. CHEV finds himself drifting into a dream state.
T: FLASH CUT TO:
S: INT CAB, TIME UNKNOWN
C: C
D: HEV'S eyes are glazed, staring through the window.
N: He notices something strange in the CAB'S rear view mirror - something RED. CHEV'S eyes WIDEN.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT CAB, TIME UNKNOWN
N: WIDE SHOT: the CAB cruises by ... a low sound builds to a DEAFENING ROAR ... following the CAB, a giant RED PACMAN GHOST rumbles down the street, animated, two dimensional ...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT CAB, DAY
N: CHEV jerks awake, and back to his senses.
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: We're here.

C: CHEV
D: What'd you say was in this stuff?
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: I told you: it's hardcore.
N: hey pull up to the sidewalk in front of a run down, 40's era warehouse building at the outskirts of the LA Garment District. CHEV gets out.
C: CHEV
D: Wow.
E: still shaking it off
C: AITIAN CABBIE
D: Five fifty five.
N: CHEV digs through EVE'S purse, which he'd been holding in his lap the whole time, pulls out a fifty and hands it to the CABBIE. The CABBIE digs for change.
C: CHEV
D: It's all you, man. Keep it.
C: HAITIAN CABBIE
D: Have a nice day, devil.
N: CHEV puts the purse over his shoulder, turns to take a look at the building.
C: CHEV
D: Right...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, UPSTAIRS, SAME TIME
N: HIGH ANGLE: From an upper floor window someone is watching CHEV survey the building as the cab pulls away.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, SAME TIME
N: CHEV walks toward the front door, then stops short.
C: CHEV
D: Wait a minute, wait a minute ...
E: to himself
N: He glances toward the upper windows.
C: CHEV
D: This is fucked.
E: CONT'D suddenly suspicious
N: He changes direction, heads around the side of the building.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, UPSTAIRS, SAME TIME
N: CHEV disappears. HOOD #1 (O.S.) Where's he going?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, SAME TIME
N: CHEV comes up on a loading platform. Korean workers are loading boxes out of the building into the backs of trucks in the sweltering heat. He walks by them into the building without making eye contact with anyone. They barely notice.
S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, PACKING ROOM, SAME TIME
N: 9 99 He skirts the packing floor and heads to a dilapidated freight elevator, gets on, starts up.
S: INT FREIGHT ELEVATOR, SAME TIME
N: The front and ceiling of the ELEVATOR are open, exposing the shaft, the cables and the passing floors; he reaches the 4TH FLOOR, heading up ... hundreds of Koreans sitting at sewing machines, all running at once, a mind numbing din ... windows painted over black, chipped and cracked in places with shards of light slicing through ... slow turning ceiling fans and long rows of fluorescent light beating down on the tables ... HEV hops off and lets the elevator keep going.
S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, 4TH FLOOR, SECONDS LATER
N: THE CAMERA follows CHEV through the room, along the humming rows of sewing machines. He crosses from one side of the room to another, where a single open window leading out to the fire escape streams sunlight. A SUPERVISOR, Korean, skinny, mid-thirties, stringy mustache, is dozed off in a chair by the window. CHEV walks right by, out the window and onto the fire escape. The CAMERA stays with him.
S: EXT FIRE ESCAPE, CONTINUOUS
N: CHEV beats his head into the brick wall, climbs up the fire escape, skips the next floor up, gets onto the roof.
S: EXT ROOF, SECONDS LATER
N: CHEV ducks behind a big ventilation duct. HOOD #2, mid 40's, stocky, is leaning over the edge of the building on the opposite side, looking for something - presumably CHEV - holding a cell phone up to his ear. His folded jacket and gun sit on the ledge beside him. We recognize the HOOD from CARLITO'S place; he was one of the men loitering around the pool. CHEV sneaks up. HOOD #2 How the hell should I know? He went in where they load the boxes. Alright, alright ... e clicks off - and CHEV is on him, snatching up the HOOD'S gun, spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh under his chin.
C: CHEV
D: Hey, what a coincidence, you like this spot too?
E: sarcastically
N: HOOD #2 Chevy! Shit!
C: HEV
D: What the fuck is this, you working for the Chinese now?
N: HOOD #2 The Chinese... are you crazy?
C: CHEV
D: Yeah I am. Where's Kaylo?
N: HOOD #2 Chevy ... I'm sorry, man ... I didn't ...
C: CHEV
D: OK, ding, time's up ...
E: losing his patience
N: In one quick motion he grabs ahold of one of the HOOD'S legs, hoists him up over the ledge and TIPS HIM OFF THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, then turns and heads for the roof access door ... HOOD #2 (O.S.) (falling) You son of a ... ! ... long seconds later, a THUD.
S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, 5TH FLOOR, MOMENTS LATER
N: 04 104 The 5TH FLOOR is a little used storage level - stacked boxes, dusty file cabinets, garbage everywhere ... starkly lit with harsh overhead fixtures as old as the building itself. We recognize this as the room KAYLO called from ... more so because his LIMP BODY is still duct taped to the rolling office chair, now lying on its side in the middle of the room. half dozen more HOODS are gathered in front of the freight elevator when CHEV appears behind them, taking everyone by surprise. e's standing over KAYLO'S body, gun drawn, EVE'S beaded purse still slung over his shoulder, PISSING FIRE.
C: CHEV
D: Alright, where is that motherfucker?
N: The HOODS are completely taken by surprise; they back away from CHEV, spreading out. OOD #3 Uh ... hey, Chev. The HOODS act almost guilty ... it's obvious everyone knows each other.
C: CHEV
D: What the fuck is this?
N: OOD #1 Chevy, baby, take it easy. CHEV points the gun at HOOD #1's head; the others raise their guns at him.
C: HEV
D: ike this? WHERE'S VERONA?
N: HOOD #1 Verona got nothing to do with this.
C: CHEV
D: What?
N: HOOD #1 Don Carlos wants you off the street.
C: CHEV
D: Carlito?
E: stunned
N: HOOD #1 You've totally lost your shit, dude ... you're all over the TV ... destroying property, making unauthorized hits ... you're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment. CHEV gestures toward KAYLO in disbelief.
C: CHEV
D: Carlito ordered this?
N: HOOD #1 (ignoring it) Look, forget about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die.
C: CHEV
D: Just die.
N: HOOD #1 Yeah. Just ... die. CHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to slow. The wooden elevator starts down. He looks around, making eye contact with the other HOODS ...
C: CHEV
D: Maybe you're right.
N: ... then down to KAYLO'S crumpled body. He sees the stocking feet, the pumps ... his HEART starts to jitter - THUDUB ... LUB ... THUDUB ... his vision doubles ... he starts to swoon HOOD #1 (rationalizing) I mean we all gotta die sometime, right? HOOD #1 snickers. The others share a tense laugh.
C: CHEV
D: That's true ... we all gotta die ...
N: CHEV stumbles, props himself up with one hand.
C: CHEV
D: Right ... so ... let's all die ...
E: CONT'D
N: HOOD #1 Eh? CHEV brings up his gun in the blink of an eye, draws a bead on HOOD #1 and is about to set off a SHOOTING GALLERY, when the ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES and the door SLIDES OPEN. EVE WALKS IN... looks around, and FREEZES. They all turn to look. HOOD #1 (CONT'D) What the...? CHEV affords himself about a second and a half of BUG-EYED SHOCK before snapping out of it and DROPPING HOOD #1 INSTANTLY WITH A SHOT TO THE HEAD. HAOS BREAKS OUT as the others dive for cover and start blasting. CHEV yanks KAYLO'S chair up and shoves it toward the HOODS - then makes a break for the elevator shaft, grabbing EVE as he goes. AYLO'S body screens CHEV and EVE as they run, taking hits, finally toppling over again. CHEV takes out another HOOD on the run, nailing him right between the eyes. HEV turns his back on the hoods, covering EVE, as they make a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a BULLET IN THE ASS.
C: CHEV
D: OW!
N: He spins and empties his clip at the HOODS, who hit the deck. EVE holds his ass as CHEV looks down the open elevator shaft. The elevator is half a floor down, moving slow. He grabs EVE, then the cable... they jump for it.
S: INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, 4TH FLOOR, SECONDS LATER
N: 05 105 CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a CRASH and roll out onto the 4th floor. The workers are all in a panic, standing by their sewing machines - they've obviously heard the shots. The SUPERVISOR is walking around, shoving them back into their seats, screaming at everyone in Korean to keep working. The SUPERVISOR, all of five feet, walks right up to CHEV and EVE, and starts screaming at them in broken English.
C: SUPERVISOR
D: You! Assholes! What you want!
N: EVE completely FLIPS OUT and starts SHOUTING DOWN the little man.
C: EVE
D: DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!! MY BOYFRIEND KILLS PEOPLE!!!
C: CHEV
D: Nice.
N: The door on the far end of the room BUSTS OPEN and HOODS pour in from the stairwell. They spot him. CHEV and EVE duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of machines toward the windows. The HOODS fan out. They play cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and Koreans while the SUPERVISOR, oblivious, continues screaming and forcing the workers back into their chairs. CHEV puts a finger to EVE'S lips, calming her momentarily... ... then comes up behind a youngish HOOD and shoves the HOOD'S gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at least fifty years old, operated by a Korean woman even older. THE RUSTY THING PUNCTURES HIS HAND OVER AND OVER AS HE SCREAMS, JUMPING UP AND DOWN, UNABLE TO GET FREE. HEV grabs the gun. They make for the fire escape.
S: EXT FIRE ESCAPE, SECONDS LATER
N: They reach the bottom of the ladder and are PINNED DOWN by gunfire from above. CHEV gives her a LOOK that says it all.
C: EVE
D: I had to see if you were telling the truth... oh, and you have my purse.
N: CHEV notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off and hands it to her. With a quick upward glance he breaks cover and squeezes off 4 SHOTS, nailing two HOODS on the fire escape.
C: CHEV
D: Come on! Wait -
N: She freezes - one of the DEAD HOODS lands with a THUD in the spot she would've been -
C: CHEV
D: ... OK, now come on.
E: CONT'D
N: EVE is pale as a sheet. She steps over the body like she was avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... CHEV grabs her hand and yanks her along. He spots EVE'S CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND RICOCHET off the pavement. EVE is rifling through her purse as they run. Naturally CHEV assumes she's looking for the CAR KEYS.
C: EVE
D: Darn it, I forgot to take my birth control pill.
N: CHEV answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out onto the ground. o keys.
C: CHEV
D: here's the keys? VE holds out her hand, where she's had them all along.
C: CHEV
D: Cool.
E: CONT'D taking them
C: EVE
D: My stuff...
N: She looks like she's about to wander around, gathering up her things, when another volley of shots BLOWS OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW of the car. CHEV picks EVE up like a sack of grain and THROWS HER, HEAD FIRST, THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW, INTO THE CAR, then runs around the other side, hops in and PEELS OUT.
S: INT. EVE'S CAR - DAY
N: EVE gets herself turned upright and stares at CHEV, hair full of windshield glass.
C: EVE
D: You weren't lying.
C: CHEV
D: Welcome to my life.
C: EVE
D: No, I mean: that you were going to give it all up for me.
E: head over heels IN LOVE
C: CHEV
D: Oh. Yeah.
C: EVE
D: And the other part?
C: CHEV
D: The poison? Yeah, that's true too.
N: e SLAMS his fist against the wheel.
C: EVE
D: Then... that means...
E: cracking
C: CHEV
D: Pretty much.
C: EVE
D: How can we stop it?
C: CHEV
D: Adrenaline. It's the only thing that slows it down.
C: VE
D: So... when we were in Chinatown...?
E: getting it
C: CHEV
D: Yeah. Sorry.
N: A LOOK OF DETERMINATION comes over her. She reaches for his crotch.
C: CHEV
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: EVE
D: his will get you going.
C: CHEV
D: WHAT?
C: EVE
D: Come on, let's finish what you started.
N: CHEV'S eyes flash to the rearview mirror and GO WIDE. He grabs the back of EVE'S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP - just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out the front. EVE'S head STAYS DOWN.
C: CHEV
D: Oh boy...
N: CHEV is straining against the seat, EVASIVE DRIVING as she GOES DOWN on him.
C: CHEV
D: Oh yeah, that's... that's really working for me...
E: CONT'D
N: EVE'S head pops up. E
C: VE
D: You like that?
E: working him up
N: Shots whiz by.
C: CHEV
D: Stay down.
N: He pushes her head back down. CHEV'S heart is POUNDING like a jackhammer. He's got himself arched into a crazy position, making it happen.
C: CHEV
D: That's it that's it that's it... just a little...
E: CONT'D
N: EVE'S head quickly pops back up. She PUSHES AWAY.
C: CHEV
D: What's the matter?
E: CONT'D flustered
C: VE
D: So you can fall asleep like you always do? I don't think so.
E: satisfied
N: CHEV loses his mind. He SLAMS THE BRAKES to put the car into a SLIDE, exposing his driver side to the pursuing sedan - punches his gun hand out the window and BLASTS AWAY. He NAILS THE DRIVER BETWEEN THE EYES... the window DISINTEGRATES... The SEDAN full of HOODS skids into the sidewalk. Steam pours from the radiator. XT. CITY STREET - DAY CHEV gets out and walks DIRECTLY UP TO THE SEDAN, one hand holding his gun straight out in front of him, the other PULLING UP HIS JOGGING PANTS, which are bunched up around his knees. CHEV unloads the entire clip into the SEDAN before any of the HOODS can react. e walks back to EVE'S CAR, cool as a cucumber, gets in and pulls away. NT. EVE'S CAR - DAY EVE'S face has turned a distinct shade of PALE GREEN.
C: EVE
D: Are they... OK?
N: CHEV looks at her like she's nuts.
C: CHEV
D: They're dead.
N: EVE is overwhelmed.
C: EVE
D: How can you... how can you do that...?
N: CHEV barely hears her - he's become DISTRACTED, flexing his left hand and feeling around his legs.
C: CHEV
D: I told you, baby... I quit.
N: He spots something, hits the brakes.
C: CHEV
D: Wait here.
E: CONT'D
N: He jumps out.
S: EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
N: CHEV almost COLLAPSES when his feet hit the ground. It seems like the left half of his body has simply stopped working.
C: CHEV
D: Jesus Christ! Now what...?
N: He unsnaps the buttons of the warm-up pants to reveal that his left leg has TURNED GREY. He's HALF DEAD.
C: EVE
D: What's the matter?
C: CHEV
D: Stay.
E: pointing at her
N: They've pulled up across the street from a HARDWARE STORE. CHEV drags his carcass across the street, oblivious to the traffic swerving and braking to avoid him, and stumbles in. EVE stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then pulls herself together and gets out. She follows CHEV'S path, crossing the street through traffic. TORE EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS start bailing out of the store in a PANIC as she approaches the front doors. She walks through them and INSIDE.
S: INT HARDWARE STORE, SECONDS LATER
N: EVE dream-walks through the store, past the registers, following CHEV'S trail of BLOOD-SMEARED FOOTPRINTS. A pimple-faced STOCK CLERK blows by her, not looking back.
C: STOCK CLERK
D: He's got a gun!
N: She turns the corner and there's CHEV - he's propped up in the middle of an aisle in front of a bin of NAILS, HAMMER in one hand... e's already hammered SIX FRAMING NAILS INTO HIS LEG and is busy POUNDING IN NUMBER SEVEN. He looks up at her, eyes wild.
C: CHEV
D: I can't feel my leg.
N: EVE is speechless. SOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. At first CHEV doesn't understand where the SOUND is coming from ... he looks around as if a RED GHOST might glide around a random corner any second ... then realizes his CELL is in his pocket. He answers it.
C: CHEV
D: ello?
E: CONT'D
C: DOC MILES
D: Chevy! Holy shit, man, I've been trying to reach you for a half hour.
C: CHEV
D: Where are you?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS
N: DOC is calling from the broken down apartment we saw earlier. CHOCOLATE is kicking back on a worn, brown imitation leather sofa in the background, watching TV.
C: DOC MILES
D: I'm at my office. Can you get here?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT HARDWARE STORE, SIMULTANEOUS
N: SIRENS approach outside. CHEV meets EVE'S eyes, shakes his head: unbelievable.
C: CHEV
D: Sure, why not?
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: INT CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT, 9 MINUTES LATER
N: An IV bag bubbles, a portable HEART MONITOR beeps. The CAMERA follows the drip down to CHEV'S arm. He's lying on the brown sofa, wheezing thickly. Some kind of Court TV show plays on the tube in the background. DOC MILES crouches beside CHEV, examines the heart monitor, shakes his head.
C: HEV

D: What is this stuff?
C: DOC MILES
D: Synthetic ephedrine, diluted with saline.
C: CHEV
D: It feels sort of good.
C: DOC MILES
D: Oh, I also gave you a little meth. That's the endorphins rushing into to your brain that you're feeling.
C: CHEV
D: So I'm not... better?
C: DOC MILES
D: Fuck no. You're in such shit shape it's stunning. I've never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep ticking. You should be in a fucking medical journal or something.
C: CHEV
D: So... what are you going to do?
N: DOC just shrugs.
C: DOC MILES
D: The solution I'm giving you is acting as a competitive inhibitor... meaning it pushes the poison out of your receptors and replaces it with a chemical... it's a temporary fix...
C: CHEV
D: Then what?

D: And what are you prepared to give me. Asshole.
C: CHEV
D: How about the jewelry I got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker?

S: EXT STANDARD HOTEL, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY
N: CHEV bangs through the revolving glass doors to the hotel. The CAMERA shifts to a ROUGH HANDHELD POV, similar to the shot that starts the film. The MUSIC is replaced by the SOUND of CHEV'S labored BREATHING and HEARTBEAT. The POV doubles, goes in and out of focus. n one continuous shot he approaches the STANDARD HOTEL and walks past the valets into the RETRO-MOD LOBBY.
S: INT LOBBY, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
N: The shot continues as CHEV moves through the LOBBY and makes a beeline for the RESTROOM. Scattered around are hard looking DUDES pretending to read newspapers ... he passes them by, avoiding eye contact.
S: INT BATHROOM, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
N: 33 133 The bathroom is empty. He walks into a stall, shuts the door and opens his coat - we see a PAGER-SIZED device clipped to his belt - a green LED is illuminated. EVERSE: CHEV adjusts a tiny knob on the device. His face is shiny with perspiration. He pulls out his shirt tails ... we see that a small tube runs from the device to a needle inserted in the base of spine, taped up with white adhesive. HEV tucks the shirt back carefully, takes a series of deep breaths and leaves the stall.
S: INT LOBBY, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
N: He bangs open the door to the restroom and pushes past three of the DUDES, who were about to go in. They let him pass, trying to avoid attention. CHEV makes his way to the ELEVATORS, hits the UP button. The doors open, he gets on. The DUDES watch from the LOBBY.
S: INT ELEVATOR, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
N: A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN - early 50s, compact and under five feet, immaculately groomed - hustles on as the doors slide shut. He stands opposite CHEV against the wall and stares at him, expressionless.
C: CHEV
D: What's happening, brother?
N: Silence. CHEV takes a small bottle of PILLS from his coat pocket and swallows them dry. He closes his eyes and leans against the wall to steady himself as the effect of the pills washes over him. n UNEXPECTED VOICE breaks the silence.
C: KAREN CHELIOS
D: Where did I go wrong?
N: CHEV'S eyes SNAP OPEN. The JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN stares back, impassively.
C: CHEV
D: Did you say something?
E: weirded out
N: Now the JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN answers - but when he moves his lips, it's the voice of A WOMAN IN HER 40s.
C: KAREN CHELIOS
D: Like talking to the wall...
C: HEV
D: Mom?
C: KAREN CHELIOS
D: I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.

E: MORE
N: CONTINUED: (3) ALEX(CONT'D) He said you probably been a contract killer since grade school. s he speaks, ALEX'S voice transforms again, this time into CHEV'S... he's now talking to A MIRROR OF HIMSELF...
C: MIRROR CHEV
D: Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies. Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush. Cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like... like a GIFT... a warrior's death... hell, you'd probably get off on it...
C: HEV

C: CHEV
D: Some pills, Doc.
E: CONT'D under his breath

C: GOON
D: This way.
S: INT RESTAURANT, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
N: The GOONS lead CHEV through a posh dining area, down a dark corridor. They frisk him, finding the obvious .45 in the shoulder holster, yank it out and push him into a SMOKING LOUNGE.
S: INT SMOKING LOUNGE, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
N: CARLITO and RICKY VERONA sit side by side at the table. An iced bucket of champagne, good cigars. GOONS chill in the corners. The whole floor has been cleared out - they've got the place all to themselves.

E: smug

D: Looks like everyone's here.

D: Why don't you sit down?
C: VERONA
D: Wait a minute. gesturing to the GOONS by the door) Pat him down again. He's carrying something.
N: The GOONS give him another look. This time they reach down his pants and produce a second small, concealed handgun ... then discover the pager-like device. One of the goons rips the tube from CHEV's back - CHEV winces in pain. His HEARTRATE starts to slow almost immediately.
C: CARLITO
D: Let me see that.
N: A GOON tosses it to him.
C: CARLITO
D: Clever ... what is this, an insulin pump?
E: CONT'D

E: egging him on
C: CARLITO
D: That's enough.

D: You'll probably throw boss a nice little reach-around just to show what a good bitch you are.
C: VERONA
D: I'm nobody's little bitch, you hear me? He'll pay what I tell him to pay...!
C: CARLITO
D: I said that's enough. It's been a long day. But in the end, you must agree, it all works out quite nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you...
E: calmly
N: CARLITO unlatches a 2'x6" beautifully crafted mahogany wood case sitting on the table in front of him. It contains several SYRINGES and bottle of MILKY FLUID. He removes one SYRINGE from the box with a gloved hand. It almost glows in the soft light. C
C: ARLITO
D: ... and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall. Please understand, Chev, it's truly nothing personal.

D: The Chinese shit. Hold him down.
E: nods to the GOONS
N: In a flash, CHEV WHIPS OUT A GUN - everyone FLINCHES... but no, wait: he's just holding out his fist, pointing the STICK- EM-UP FINGER right between CARLITO'S eyes.
C: CHEV
D: Not so fast, motherfucker.
N: For a beat, no one knows quite how to react. VERONA chuckles nervously.
C: VERONA
D: Dude's gone dipsy doodle...
N: CHEV whips the finger toward VERONA, shutting him down mid- word. VERONA shrugs it off with less than 100% confidence... the room EXHALES.
C: VERONA
D: Whatever, psycho...
E: CONT'D
C: CARLITO
D: I'm afraid the Houdini act is over, Chelios.
N: A GOON makes a move for CHEV... but CHEV spins on him, leveling the finger at the GOON'S forehead, and pulls the "trigger"...
C: CHEV
D: Booosh!
E: imitating a gunshot
N: The GOON'S head is rocked back, a NICKEL-SIZED HOLE popped right through the cranium... a GLORIOUS FOUNTAIN OF CRIMSON arcs from the GOON'S forehead across the table, splashing into the ice bucket.
C: VERONA
D: Ourfather whoartinheaven hallowedbethy -
E: freaking
C: CARLITO
D: Shut up, Verona.
C: DON KIM
D: So this is how it is.
N: Everyone turns... DON KIM, in a Ralph Lauren polo shirt and white slacks, is standing at the entrance of the bar. He's got an ASIAN GANGSTER on each side, one of them holding out a smoking, silenced GLOCK .9mm. More ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes are dead-blank COLD AS HELL.
C: ERONA
D: What... you... he...
C: CHEV
D: Presto.
N: One of CARLITO'S GOONS points an UZI at DON KIM... and is FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of ASIANS on his blind side... who are CUT TO RIBBONS by another of CARLITO'S MEN... and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. CARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his GOONS, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the bar... the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets... VERONA whips out a .357 MAGNUM, turns toward CHEV... ummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, CHEV kicks the table forward, pinning VERONA'S legs to the bench - the ICE BUCKET slides into CHEV'S lap... e snatches out a bottle of Dom Perignon and fastballs it at VERONA'S GUN HAND... the bottle SHATTERS... VERONA bobbles the .357... it hits the ground - GOES OFF - and the four fingers of VERONA'S right hand are VAPORIZED. VERONA SHRIEKS like a ten year old girl at a JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE concert. Behind the bar, CARLITO quickly punches up his cell phone.

DON KIM stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed.
C: CARLITO
D: I'll kill you for this, Chelios!
E: from behind the bar
C: CHEV
D: Too late!
N: CHEV swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a GUN and pries it from the hand of a dead GOON... he spots VERONA'S FEET disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires - blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers. An ASIAN GANGSTER runs up and lobs a GRENADE behind the BAR... it bounces along and comes to rest next to CARLITO. CARLITO thinks quick, grabbing one of his GOONS - a 265 pounder - from behind...
C: CARLITO
D: Get down!
N: He BODY-TACKLES the BIG MAN onto the floor, right on top of the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him.
C: GOON
D: Thanks, boss.
N: BOOM! The BIG GOON'S body absorbs the blast, which picks them both up five feet in the air... CARLITO, momentarily airborne, pops up from behind the bar like a JACK IN THE BOX, then drops back down with a THUD...

D: Ronnie James Dio...!
N: The LOUNGE opens into a daylight drenched POOL AREA... CARLITO'S HELICOPTER drops down into view, roiling up the water... CARLITO makes a break for it.
