S: INT. DFID OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY.
N: SIMON is arriving with JUDY. Simon carrying his red dispatch box. Simon's worried.
C: SIMON
D: Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night's interview?
C: JUDY
D: No not yet.
C: SIMON
D: Perhaps he didn't hear it.
C: JUDY
D: Or maybe he's dead.
C: SIMON
D: He might be dead. He might have had that massive stroke we've all been waiting for. It's in the post.
E: with a degree of genuine hope
S: INT. MALCOLM'S OFFICE. DAY.
C: SIMON
D: ...preventable sickness in many of the poorest countries round the world....and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which is a major, major issue.... Page 2
E: ON RADIO
N: CON TINUE D:
C: MALCOLM
D: Diarrhoea? I mean, this is the minister for International Development. He should be talking about food parcels, not fucking arse-spraying mayhem.
N: SAM laughs.
C: SIMON
D: And so if we can tackle the easy things, like diarrhoea, then we can.....
E: ON RADIO
C: MALCOLM
D: Oh yes, say it again. Very good. What is this, The Shitting Forecast?
C: SIMON
D: ...and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases.
E: ON RADIO
C: EDDIE MAIR
D: You mentioned the word `war"
N: MALCOLM is paying extremely close attention now.
C: MALCOLM
D: Steady Eddie...
C: SIMON
D: Against preventable diseases, yes....
E: ON RADIO
C: EDDIE MAIR

E: ON RADIO

D: Well....personally, I think that war is unforseeable.
E: ON RADIO
C: MALCOLM
D: Sam! Sam!

E: ON RADIO

S: EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET LONDON. DAY.
N: MALCOLM emerges into the street. On the phone.
C: MALCOLM
D: He did not say "unforseeable'. You may have heard him say it, but he did not say that, and that is a fact.
S: INT. DFI OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY.
C: JUDY
D: He'll want you to row back from the `unforeseeable' thing on Question Time tonight.
C: SIMON
D: On Question Time, you know the funny question they always ask at the end?
C: JUDY
D: Yes?
C: SIMON
D: I think we should prep that now. I'd like to shine on the funny question, cos I'm a funny guy. With a light touch.
N: SIMON deposits his briafcase. Judy finds some clippings, returns.
C: JUDY
D: There's this guy, he's a property tycoon. He's bought a South Sea Island. It might be something like that, you know. "If you had to spend the rest of your life on a desert island, who would it be with?"
C: SIMON
D: Ah. Well, I can't say my wife, because I haven't got one, and I can't say my girlfriend, because I haven't got one of those either.
C: JUDY
D: And don't say Mandela, that's...
C: SIMON
D: No. Boring. And a bloke.
C: JUDY
D: Or Keira Knightley.
C: SIMON
D: Well, that's a good idea. Page 4

N: Toby and Suzy walking to work together.
C: SUZY
D: Did you take the washing out of the machine?
C: TOBY
D: No.
C: SUZY
D: What do you mean, no?
C: TOBY
D: No. I didn't take the washing out of the machine.
C: SUZY
D: It's going to go really stale.
C: TOBY
D: It'll be fine.
C: SUZY
D: It's not fine. By the time...
C: TOBY
D: It is fine. I'll wear stale pants.
C: SUZY
D: I don't want to go out with some who wears stale pants.
C: TOBY
D: Well, there we go. I could go commando, but I don't think that's acceptable in government.
C: SUZY
D: Please. So: got everything you need for your first day in International Development?
E: Disgusted
N: Page 5 CON TINUE D:
C: TOBY
D: Oh Yes. It's all here. My massive intellect. And an apple for Simon Foster.
C: SUZY
D: Simon Fluster.
C: TOBY
D: Don't say that, I'm rebranding him.
C: SUZY
D: Well he was crap on the radio last night. He sounded like a chicken with a wasp up its arse.
C: TOBY
D: Well I'm going to sort that out. After a week I'll have him sounding like a chicken without a wasp up its arse.
C: SUZY
D: Have a good day, good luck honey.
C: TOBY
D: Have a good day at the Foreign Office. Try not to annoy Russia.
C: SUZY
D: I'll give you a call later. Keep your phone on. Bye.
C: TOBY
D: Yeah, alright.
C: SUZY
D: Oh and be careful - cars!
N: They walk off in separate directions.
S: MORNING/INT. MICHAEL'S FO OFFICE - MORNING
N: Toby is walking towards DFID. As he nears the building he finds himself next to Malcolm, who is heading in too. Toby is on the phone.
T: INTERCUT PHONE CALL:
C: TOBY
D: Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes, because you're starting to remind me of my mum. And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction.
N: Suzy is still in the FO office. Page 6 CON TINUE D:
C: SUZY
D: I'm just checking whether you put last night's lasagne in the fridge.
N: In the FO office, MICHAEL arrives. He has a small suitcase and a paper bag. He holds this up.
C: MICHAEL
D: Croissants!
E: mouthing
N: Back with Malcolm, Toby close by. Malc's on the phone.
C: MALCOLM
D: No. You're fine to go ahead and print that. It's lies, you'd be lying, but go ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No he did not. Oh, just before you go -- when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference...would email be better? Or a phone call? Or, hey I know, I'll write it on a cake, "Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the new baby" in those little silver balls. Yeah, maybe best to spike it? Okay. Fuckity-bye!
E: BEAT
N: Toby is now next to Malcolm in the building (or better still, in a lift). Malcolm becomes aware of him.
C: TOBY
D: No, it's fine, it's in the fridge. I put some clingfilm over it. In the FO office, Michael switches on some classical music.
C: SUZY
D: Why did you put clingfilm on it?
C: TOBY
D: To keep it fresh.
N: Malcolm starts dialling on his phone.
C: SUZY
D: It's in the fridge, that'll keep it fresh.
C: TOBY
D: No, but it still might dry out.
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah, Malcolm Tucker. Can I speak to James Lewis at the PM Programme please? Page 7
E: into phone
N: CON TINUE D: (2) Michael hands Suzie a croissant.
C: MICHAEL
D: Still slightly warm. That's how I like my women as well.
E: knowing Toby is on the other end of the line
C: SUZY
D: Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby.
C: TOBY
D: No it isn't. That's a myth. Clingfilm is perfectly safe.
N: Malcolm now eyeing Toby with suspicion/contempt -- who is this dick? Toby tries to smile, lowers his voice, embarrassed.
C: MALCOLM
D: No, I'll hold,. what's he waiting for? A sex-change?
E: into phone
C: TOBY
D: They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer. Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer. And Lasagne doesn't give you syphillis.
C: MALCOLM
D: James! Right --Simon Foster? Yeah, very funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody. Listen, we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow, OK? No, YOU relax. Tell you what, I'll come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown. GET ME FUCKING BRIAN!

C: SIMON
D: What?
E: sensing something's up
C: JUDY
D: Malcolm's coming to see you.
C: SIMON
D: Shit. He's still alive. When's he due? Malcolm walks in with Toby sheepishly behind him.
C: MALCOLM
D: Now. And don't say you weren't prepared because I rang ahead. Give us a minute, will you love?
E: To JUDY
N: Judy gets up as Malcolm turns back to SIMON
C: MALCOLM
D: In the words of the late, great Nat King Fucking Cole, `Unforeseeable, that's what you are..'
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DFI OPEN PLAN OFFICE
N: JUDY has spotted TOBY.
C: JUDY
D: So you're...whatever your name is, Dan, the new advisor? Daniel.
C: TOBY
D: Toby.
C: JUDY
D: Right. Just most of you lot tend to be called Dan, or Danny, so it's always worth a punt. OK, hello. As you know, I'm Judy Molloy, Civil Service Director of Communications for International Development.
N: They shake hands. Page 9 CON TINUE D:
C: TOBY
D: Is this a normal morning, or...?
N: Judy's not got time for questions.
C: JUDY
D: Okay, I've got a meeting in two minutes. And the minister was rubbish in last night's interview.
E: looks at watch
C: TOBY
D: Rubbish?
C: JUDY
D: It's a technical term. It means he went on the radio and everyone could hear that he was rubbish.
N: Someone goes into Simon's office. As door opens we hear heated conversation between Simon and Malcolm.
C: MALCOLM [IN OFFICE]
D: You sounded like a panicky chimp trapped in a washing machine.
S: INT. DFID SIMON'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: Back inside Simon's office.
C: SIMON
D: Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a personal opinion.
C: MALCOLM
D: Oh why didn't you say? I mean, he asked you. Fuck. Of course, that explains it. Yeah. Say, if he'd asked you to fucking black up, or give him your PIN number, or shot yourself, would you have done that as well.
C: SIMON
D: I would have blacked up. It was the radio and no-one would have known.
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah. Very good.
C: SIMON
D: But war is -- basically unforeseeable isn't it?
C: MALCOLM
D: That is not our line, alright? Walk the fucking line. Look. Page 10
E: MOR E
C: CON TINUE D: MAL COLM
D: We've got Karen Clark over from Washington, okay? We've got the US National Security Advisor's main guy coming. Yeah? We've got enough Pentagon goons here for a fucking coup d'etat. This is not the time to send out a signal like this in some personal fucking sodcast.
E: CONT'D
N: JUDY and TOBY come in.
C: JUDY
D: Minister, this is Toby.
C: MALCOLM
D: Not the time love. Fuck off.
N: JUDY smiles at MALCOLM, and doesn't fuck off.
C: SIMON
D: Hey Toby. Glad you could join us. Bit of an odd morning, but 'Welcome to the madhouse!'I apologise for Malcolm.
C: MALCOLM
D: Don't apologise for me. You should apologise for yourself. Did I not just tell you to fuck off and yet you're still here?
E: to Judy
C: JUDY
D: That's correct.
C: MALCOLM
D: Hey, foetus boy. Lesson One: If I tell you to fuck off what do you do?
E: to Toby
C: TOBY
D: Fuck off?
C: MALCOLM
D: You'll go far.Now fuck off.
C: TOBY
D: Right.
N: Toby fucks off. We can see him outside, wandering around, not knowing what to do with himself.
C: SIMON
D: We were thinking, weren't we Judy, that I could row back on Question Time tonight.
C: MALCOLM
D: No, You're not going on Question Time tonight. You've been disinvited. Page 11
N: CON TINUE D: (2)
C: SIMON
D: Why? We've been prepping Question Time.
C: MALCOLM
D: Because they ask fucking questions on Question Time. And you're no good at questions. If it was Fumbling, Off- Message Shit Fucking Answer Time, you'd be our main guy. But it's not.
C: JUDY
D: Sorry, why wasn't I told about this?
C: MALCOLM
D: Why should I tell you about this?
C: JUDY
D: Because it's a scheduled media appearance by this department's Secretary Of State and it therefore falls within my purview...
C: MALCOLM
D: Your purview? Where do you think you are sweetheart, in some Regency costume drama? This is a government department, not a fucking Jane Austen novel. Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.
C: JUDY
D: Malcolm, your swearing doesn't impress me. My husband works for Tower Hamlets and believe me, those kids make you sound like Angela Lansbury.
C: MALCOLM
D: She's married? The poor bastard.
E: to Simon, lads' chat
C: SIMON
D: But...okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment.... Are you saying that I'm now not allowed to make any media appearances?
E: Judy walks out
C: MALCOLM
D: No, not until we can trust you to keep to the line.
C: SIMON
D: But I was going to keep to the line: "I don't actually think war is unforeseeable."
N: Page 12 CON TINUE D: (3) Malcolm's looking out of the office, monitoring Judy's movements. She's flashed up on his radar. He's tracking her.
C: MALCOLM
D: What is it then?
N: A beat.
C: SIMON
D: Is it...I don't know? Foreseeable? No.
C: MALCOLM
D: No. Not foreseeable. That's fucking declaring war. Do you want to fucking declare war?
C: SIMON
D: I'm a cabinet minister. I didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance I ever had.
C: MALCOLM
D: Write this down. It's neither forseeable nor undorseeable.
C: SIMON
D: Right. So not inevitable, but not...evitable.
N: Malcolm leaves the office. Toby is still hovering.
C: MALCOLM
D: Okay, you need to work on this fucking line. That includes you, Jane Fucking Austen with the strap-on. Oh, and put the sniff out there that the next time the BBC ambushes a Minister with a war question we'll drop a bomb on them.
E: calling back to Simon to Judy
C: JUDY
D: I can't do that. That's political, that's not in my...
C: MALCOLM
D: Purview, Marie Antoinette? Weel listen, darling, why don't you fucking scuttle off back to fucking Cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks. Let them eat cock! You, Ron Weasley -- you do it.
E: TO TOBY
N: Malcolm heads out. Page 13

N: Suzy dials.
S: INT. DFID/INT FOREIGN OFFICE MICHAELS OFFICE
N: Toby checks the phone. Sees it's Suzy -- Christ, not her again, I'm a bit busy here. He answers.
T: INTERCUT PHONE CALL:
C: TOBY
D: Hiya. You do know this is the third time you've rung? Are you on a new tariff?
C: SUZY
D: So? How's it going? You found the bogs yet?
C: TOBY
D: All a bit manic. It was never like this at Agriculture. People tend not to swear so much about wheat. Apart from farmers. They swear about everything.
C: SUZY
D: Can you turn that down a bit? Look, I've got a leg up for you. I think we could get Simon into the big meeting with Karen Clark?
E: to Michael, re. the music to Toby
C: TOBY
D: Right - Karen Clark from...is that the woman who went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia?
N: Page 14 CON TINUE D:
C: SUZY
D: Karen Clark, US Assistant Secretary of State?

C: MICHAEL
D: Meat.
C: SUZY
D: Meat.
C: MICHAEL
D: Meat! Simon's only going to be meat in the room. Don't get his hopes up.
C: SUZY
D: Yeah, so you know -- Simon, between us, he's just going to be meat in the room.
C: TOBY
D: Meat?
N: Judy, nearby, hears this.
C: SUZY
D: Yeah. The Americans don't feel they're getting a real meeting unless there's thirty of you on each side. So Simon is...you know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical goods? Sort of one of those. But you might not want to tell him that. I ought to go. I love you.
E: waving him away
N: Judy's hovering nearby.
C: TOBY
D: Likewise. Affirmative on that.
S: INT. DFID - DAY / INT. SIMON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Judy is hovering as Toby finishes his call.

N: She starts walking away. Toby follows.
C: TOBY
D: Um, I do just need to... Page 15
N: CON TINUE D:
C: JUDY
D: Over there...that's Mike's patch. Leave Mike to it. He knows what he's doing. Don't you Mike?
C: MIKE
D: What?
C: JUDY
D: Exactly. He's an idiot. He organised 3,000 tents and sanitation packs for Rwanda.
E: as they walk on
C: TOBY
D: Right...is that not...?
C: JUDY
D: They needed them in Luanda. Angola. It's been in the news. And that's the end of the tour. I've got to go.
E: checks phone
C: TOBY
D: Look, I understand your hostility to new wood coming in..
C: JUDY
D: There's a lot of really important people you need to know about, but I haven't got time.
N: But she's gone. Toby heads over to Simon's office. The door's open. He pops his head in.
C: TOBY
D: Hey, boss.
C: SIMON
D: Toby, hi. Sorry about earlier -- Malcolm. He's a bit of an...alpha male, isn't he?
C: TOBY
D: Look, I've managed to get you into the big meeting at the Foreign Office this afternoon.
C: SIMON
D: The Karen Clark meeting? Shit, really? Sure. How did you...?
C: TOBY
D: I did it through sheer bloody hard work.
N: Judy walks past. Simon calls out. Page 16 CON TINUE D: (2)
C: SIMON
D: Hey Judy.
N: She comes in.
C: JUDY
D: Hello?
C: SIMON
D: Tobes here has got me into the big Karen Clark meeting.
N: Judy looks at Toby. She heard the `meat' conversation.
C: JUDY
D: Wow. Yeah, the Big Meet. How are you spelling that, by the way?
C: TOBY
D: Two `e's.
S: EXT. FOREIGN OFFICE. DAY
N: Simon, Toby and Judy drive along Whitehall in their car. An awkward silence. Judy looks at Toby. She knows Simon's just off to be meat.
C: TOBY
D: Just, maybe, might be best not to get too excited. It might be that their guys muscle in and have the lion's share of the talk time.
E: off Judy's look
C: JUDY
D: Yeah. It might be like that.
C: SIMON
D: I think I can work a room, okay? I'm not a room virgin.
S: INT. FOREIGN OFFICE BUILDING. FOYER - DAY
N: Simon, Toby and Judy are going through security. Suzy and Michael come to meet them.
C: MICHAEL
D: Simon.
C: SIMON
D: Michael.
N: Page 17 CON TINUE D: A very young man approaches Michael. Looks like he is 19. He is CHAD.
C: CHAD
D: Ah, Michael? I'm Chad.
C: MICHAEL
D: Hello?
C: CHAD
D: We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon delegation. First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters.
C: SUZY
D: Right.
C: CHAD
D: Thanks so much.
N: He walks purposefully off.
C: MICHAEL
D: My God. Who was that, Young Lankenstein?
C: JUDY
D: Oh he'll be running something relatively major. They're all kids in Washington. It's like Bugsy Malone, but with real guns.
S: INT. FOREIGN OFFICE GRAND MEETING ROOM - DAY
N: Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's pretty much full. KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately. Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services. Lots of hubbub. SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to their seats. Page 18 CON TINUE D: They're as far away from the US delegation as it's possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore important I am'.
C: SIMON
D: No-one will hear me if I say anything. How's your view? Can we swap?
N: Simon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see anything.
C: SIMON
D: Can I swap with you?
E: CONT'D to Judy
C: JUDY
D: I think the meeting's starting.
N: It is.
C: SIMON
D: Well, quickly then, swap.
N: Simon and Judy swap seats. The meeting is now underway. We're with Karen Clark.
C: KAREN
D: We all agree this is a very tough time, but I don't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point.
N: Back with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to see.
C: SIMON
D: Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit hardcore.
N: He cranes again to see.
C: SIMON
D: No, this is worse. Swap back.
E: CONT'D
N: Simon and Judy swap seats again. Back with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red folder. Page 19 CON TINUE D: (2)
C: KAREN
D: This paper, authored by one of my aides, Liza Weld. You don't mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza?
N: Liza reacts. Her paper? In a big meeting. Is this good or bad?
C: KAREN
D: Illuminates the logistical factors we face. She highlights a number of reasons why, in practical terms, we can't envision a theatre deployment for twelve months.
E: CONT'D
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: Although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper.
C: KAREN
D: Really - such as what?
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: The committee feels a much quicker deployment is possible.
C: KAREN
D: Which committee?
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: This has been discussed in a number of committees. If I said one committee...
E: covering
C: KAREN
D: You did.
C: ADRIANO
D: Then that was a slip of the tongue
C: KAREN
D: Have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee? A war committee?
C: MICHAEL
D: If I can interject here, I'm aware we're pushed for time. I'd like to move us on agenda-wise. Our next item is international relief co-ordination.
N: Karen is conferring with Liza, Adriano with his guy.
C: KAREN
D: Have you heard of this committee?
C: ADRIANO
D: What's this Liza Weld paper? Page 20
N: CON TINUE D: (3) Simon is watching, feeling the meeting is passing him by.
C: SIMON
D: Should I say something? She invited me, I should say something. If you don't say something in the first 10 minutes, you can end up not saying anything at all.
E: to Judy and Toby
C: JUDY
D: I don't know whether you should say anything.
C: SIMON
D: I'm saying something ... I think I'm going to try saying something.
N: Simon goes to put his hand up, Toby maybe puts a calming hand on his hand. They look at one another. Has Toby crossed a line?
C: KAREN
D: Look - I just think it's worth noting that Ministers in The UK Government, such as our colleague here ...
E: Liza whispers - Simon's over there
C: SIMON
D: Is she talking about me?
E: pleased
C: KAREN
D: Simon Foster ...
C: SIMON
D: She's talking about me!
C: KAREN
D: Has made it clear that for them currently war is unforeseeable. Isn't that right Simon?
C: SIMON
D: Well, yes, I mean, that's what I said. And I stick to what I said.
N: SIMON sits down. Them stands back up.
C: SIMON
D: But that doesn't mean that what I said won't ever change. It's not imutable. Or mutable. It's an ongoing ...
E: CONT'D
N: Page 21 CON TINUE D: (4)
C: MICHAEL
D: I wonder if there aren't some area of mutual agreement we can't rattle through here and see how much time we have at the end for this discussion?
E: cutting in
N: He's ended the debate. Suzy comes round the back of the meeting all smiles and hands Judy a note with a smile.
C: JUDY
D: Thanks.

TOBY, SIMON and JUDY are above them standing round a circular viewing area that looks down on the lobby. The UK and US delegations are aware of each other, throwing furtive glances each other's way.
C: KAREN
D: Whichever committee they don't want me to be a member of, I want to be a member of that. It's a confused Groucho Marx.

D: Okay. Right.
N: Chad arrives. Karen talks to someone else.
C: CHAD
D: Hey Liza. Your paper got a major citation. You must be psyched Karen brought it up.
C: LIZA
D: She...that was her call. I didn't know it had been that widely read.
C: CHAD
D: You could not write anything that clashes more violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you were trying, and it almost seems like you were trying.
C: LIZA
D: I wasn't trying, believe me.
C: CHAD
D: You are like the woman from The Omen, you've given birth to a demon and it's going to kill you.

C: CHAD
D: Ooh.
C: LIZA
D: See, you're an only child, aren't you?

D: You bring this up whenever you run out of arguments. I don't see how my parents' limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me. I'm the sperm that made it.

D: What are you doing? You look like you're practicing baby massage.
E: re the typing gesture

N: The conversation is continuing between Simon Judy and Toby as they exit the FO.
C: SIMON
D: Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's not a war. It's going to be a nightmare. It's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics.

C: PRESS
D: Minister!/Simon!/Mr Foster!
N: Simon is taken aback.
C: SIMON

C: SIMON
D: What? No. No. I'll freestyle it.
N: The press are calling. REPORTER 1 Is war unforeseeable Minister?
C: SIMON
D: Look, ...loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable. Y'know, For the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly very real and inevitable.

E: under his breath to Judy
C: JUDY
D: I did try to warn you.
C: SIMON
D: You did try to warn me but you didn't actually stop me, did you?. That's like shouting 'Train!' as I get hit by a train. You should go 'Look! Train! There's a Fucking Train!'
E: stupid voice
N: JUDY'S and SIMON'S phones start ringing. They each check the number.
C: SIMON

C: MALCOLM

E: on the phone, over TV
S: INT. NUMBER TEN - DAY
N: Judy, Simon and Toby are walking towards Malcolm's office.
C: TOBY
D: The thing is. On the war. With your profile.. ... Maybe we should - get it out there? That the war is a resigning issue for you.
E: uncertain, but fuck it, he is a senior policy aide to a cabinet minister
C: SIMON
D: You can't say it's a resigning issue. Because you then have to resign.
C: JUDY
D: You are having a really great first day you know that?
N: They walk in, Malcolm's there.
C: MALCOLM
D: You are supposed to be a Cabinet Minster. You are supposed to be officer class. Don't do this. Don't make waves.
E: shouting
C: SIMON
D: We can do without the ritual humiliation, Malcolm. You know I'm against talking up the war.

E: CONT'D, TO SIMON CONT'D
C: SIMON
D: To where...?
C: MALCOLM
D: Washington. The boss wants you over there on a fact-finder. Problems we might face if it all goes boombastic in the Middle East.
C: SIMON
D: Oh. Right.
C: MALCOLM
D: But you were saying, you are on the verge of your stand...
C: SIMON
D: Well, look - I don't know what words I used in the heat of the moment, but maybe in a sense I was on the verge. But that's the important thing - I was on the verge. Not in any way decided.

C: SIMON
D: Oh right. I won't talk to him.
C: MALCOLM

S: INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY
N: Liza, Karen and Chad arrive in the buzzing State Department offices, knackered but in action mode.
C: KAREN
D: Okay - so, priorities are: take a shower, get me on Linton's War Committee, get me a dental appointment. Not necessarily in that order.
N: Karen walks past various desks covered in tons of Post- Its. Stops a STAFFER as he passes. KAREN (cont'd) (CONT'D) What's Linton been up to while we've been away....have we declared war on California yet? But before the staffer can answer they run right into Linton. Karen stands her ground.
C: LINTON
D: Ah. Karen.

C: KAREN
D: Great hotel, thank you.
N: Page 30 CON TINUE D:
C: LINTON
D: Good meetings?
C: KAREN
D: Yes. We had some good discussions. The time at Number Ten could possibly have been better spent but then...
N: Karen realises that Linton is reading a message on his cell phone and not listening.
C: LINTON
D: Good. Welcome back. I'll read your words when they come through. Thank you so much
N: Linton heads off to his office. A beat later so does Karen. Chad goes off a little towards Linton's office.
C: KAREN
D: Is Chad coming... ?
C: LIZA
D: He's doing his desperate chorus girl thing, hanging around trying to catch Linton's eye. That's why he's wearing his push-up bra today.
E: watching
C: CHAD
D: Assistant Secretary of State -- hi.
E: as he passes
C: LINTON
D: Brad.
C: CHAD
D: Chad

D: Uh-huh. Exactly
C: CHAD
D: Can I...?
N: Linton ignores him as he goes to join Bob Adriano waiting for him in his office.
C: KAREN
D: So listen, Liza, I need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill.
C: LIZA
D: Dullest?
N: Page 31 CON TINUE D: (2)
C: KAREN
D: Because Linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey war committee...they'll have buried the war committee under the most boring name they can think of. 'Diverse Strategy Committee'- not that, I'm on that. But it'll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self-harm.
N: They glance over into Linton's area. He is glancing into theirs.
C: KAREN
D: Can you get me General Miller at the Pentagon? My teeth hurt like hell.
E: CONT'D as she leaves
C: LIZA
D: Sick of hearing about the teeth...
E: to herself
N: Liza goes to her desk, picks up her landline. LIZA (cont'd) (CONT'D) Hi. I'm calling from Karen Clark's office about a paper written by a staffer here. We need to know if 'Post War Planning: Parameters, Implication's and Possibilities' has reached Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet? (listens) Yeah...by Liza Weld. (listens, shit!) 'Pwip Pip'? It's already been given an acronym? (listens) No I don't want to fast-track it. Would it possible to slow-track it? Well can we create one?
S: INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. LINTON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Looking over at Karen. Now alone, who is still stealing glances over.
C: LINTON
D: I do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office. In my opinion glass offices are for perverts.

N: Page 32 CON TINUE D:
C: LINTON
D: Frosting is for cakes, Bob. Now. What happened in London?
E: as if Bob Adriano brought it up
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: Generally positive. Two glitches. Karen flagged a report by one of her staffers - Liza. She's obviously trying to use it as some kind of roadblock. It's called Pwip Pip.
C: LINTON
D: Pip what?
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: Pwip Pip.
C: LINTON
D: What is that a report on - birdcalls? What does that stand for?
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: I don't recall. It's factish. Intel - case for and against intervention.
C: LINTON
D: We've got all the facts we need on this. In the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king. You said there was another thing?
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: In the meeting with the Foreign Office the Committee was accidentally briefly alluded to.
C: LINTON
D: Which committee?
E: putting his hand over his mouth so he can't be lip- read
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: The war committee.
E: doing the same
C: LINTON
D: Karen must not find out about that. She is an excitable yapping she-dog. Okay get the minutes of the meeting, we need to correct the record.
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: We can do that?
N: Page 33 CON TINUE D: (2)
C: LINTON
D: Yes we can. They're an aide memoir for us. So they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said, but a more full record of what was intended to be said. I think that's the more accurate version, right?
N: LATER. Bob Adriano is going through the minutes with Linton.
C: LINTON
D: I don't like this section. Cut that. I don't think this is really what France are saying. Let's change that. And these. And let's reverse this.
E: CONT'D
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: That's something Karen said.
C: LINTON
D: It's not right. Change it.
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: Yes sir.

C: SIMON
D: "So you're the President? And I'm supposed to be impressed by that?
C: TOBY
D: Yeah. "My husband works in Tower Hamlets."

C: LINTON
D: What makes you think that?
C: KAREN
D: It was mentioned in our London meeting.
C: LINTON
D: You must have misheard.
C: KAREN
D: I misheard the word committee?
C: LINTON
D: Maybe it was another word. Like Khomeini.
C: KAREN
D: You're sitting on a new Khomeini?
C: LINTON
D: Possibly. There are a lot of words, Karen. Kansas City. Kitty.

C: LIZA
D: Oh no. Holy Mother of....
E: Looking at Karen
N: Everyone is just looking at her.
C: LINTON
D: I don't mean to be rude Karen but that is a tad... repulsive. I can't concentrate on what you're saying. You have blood coming out of your teeth and that's not right.
N: Karen gets up to go. It's awkward, she's boxed in and has to clamber over the others to get to the door.
C: KAREN
D: Okay, Liza come with me.
C: CHAD
D: Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen now.
E: aside, to Liza
N: Liza follows Karen out. Chad takes Liza's seat.
C: LINTON
D: I don't like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth. It makes me think of Country and Western music. Which I really can't abide.
C: CHAD
D: Yes! Ha ha! Exactly.
E: what?
N: Linton sees his chance to take advantage of Karen being out of the room.
C: LINTON
D: Actually while we're on Any Other Business I do have a few points I'd like to resolve.

C: KAREN
D: Your military hardware is impressive.
E: CONT'D
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Not anymore it isn't. Okay so this is total current deployment. Europe, Asia. And the contingency already deployed. So the current number of combat troops available for an invasion according to these figures would be ...

D: No, twelve. Twelve soldiers. Twelve.
C: KAREN
D: You're shitting me.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Of course I'm shitting you, but 12 thousand isn't enough. Twelve thousand's about how many are going to die. And you really need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it looks like you've lost.
C: KAREN
D: Uh-huh. Tomorrow I've got to meet these Brits. Simon Foster. He's the guy that said war was unforseeable, and I think he could very useful on the committee because he could internationalise the dissent.

D: I don't know, I thought tonight we'd be tired?
C: SIMON
D: Well I am tired but I'm also a career politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours. So I thought it might be nice to, you know, go out rather than sit in my room trying to spank one out watching a shark documentary, because I'm scared if I watch a porno it'll end up in the Register of Members Interests. So what have you got?
E: approaching breaking point with Toby

C: SIMON
D: Don't bullshit me Toby.

E: he does that mobile thing where people sign off by repeatedly saying `bye' with increasing speed but diminishing volume
N: He hangs up. Very excited. Starts getting ready to see Liza. Checks his hair in the mirror. Not quite right. He opens a pot of hair gel, takes a scoop and rubs it in his hands, ready to put it in his hair. His phone goes again. Doesn't know what to do. Doesn't want to pick up the phone with gelly hands. No time to wash it off. Grabs a towel and picks up the phone holding the towel. He struggles to press the answer button. Puts the towel- covered phone to his ear.
C: TOBY
D: Hello? Hi? Hello?

C: LIZA
D: You see those guys? The mosh pit?
E: re : the mosh pit
C: TOBY
D: Yes, I don't think I've ever seen a more civilised 'mosh pit' it's more of a mosh caucus actually.

C: MALCOLM

Then with a flash as he looks at the clock - 9.07 he remembers a lot of things in a rush and springs out like a Ninja and starts pulling his clothes on, while scrabbling for his phone. He heads down stairs & out of the apartment.

C: TOBY
D: Was that...?
C: SIMON
D: Toby -- I don't want to read you the riot act here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act. Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey. `The British are coming'?

E: feels he's taken enough now
N: Page 54 CON TINUE D:
C: SIMON
D: No you're right. I should be thanking you for not throwing up. Well done. You're a star. You didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'. No I'm being unfair, you got so much right. Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career. You're a legend.
N: An uncomfortable beat.
C: TOBY
D: That was just - the first bit was it? We're going back in do you ...think?
C: SIMON
D: We'd barely said hello. I've had muggings that have lasted longer than that. We really only spoke about flammable cheese.
N: Liza comes out, passes by. Toby mouths `shit' to himself.

N: People are looking at their agendas, low-level chatter, pouring of water, etc. - a general pre-meeting feel.
C: KAREN
D: Assistant Secretary -- here on point 6, it feels like there's an assumption that we'll be invading. Should we talk about the practical? I mean this is the war committee after all?

D: What makes you say that?
C: LINTON
D: Well I noted with interest the recent comments of our colleague Simon Foster in that regard.
N: Simon is texting under the desk and not really paying full attention. He hears his name, looks up, waves to the group. He doesn't clock Karen's intense look that says `You are going to rebut that, aren't you?'
C: KAREN
D: Perhaps Mr. Foster would have something to say about that?
C: SIMON
D: I'm just...watching with interest. IN Britain we have a saying for complicated situations such as this, which is that it's `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult.'
E: politely he can't believe he's going to say this
N: He goes back to his text.

D: Yes, what an incredibly depressing motto. You see you're playing into the hands of the French saying that. Toby mooches around, peers in Linton's office. He spots a couple of A4 sheets of paper that have been printed out with `Climb the mountain of conflict!' across them as an encouraging slogan on the wall.
C: TOBY
D: Jesus.
E: CONT'D looking in
C: CHAD
D: Yeah work hours are too valuable - for networking. You gotta get in at like 6 work till 8.30 Then start making those connections baby. Emails and admin at lunch. See if you can play some strategic racquetball through the pm. Then in the six till midnight slot chow down on some serious policy work.
E: he clicks his fingers rapidly, annoyingly
C: TOBY
D: Right. And what - friends, family, novels, sexual inter-course you're going to save those for your thirties and forties?
S: INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. CORRIDOR/BATHROOM - DAY

N: CON TINUE D:
C: LINTON
D: Mr Tucker, isn't it? Hello again.
C: MALCOLM
D: You might pull this kind of stunt on some young wank fresh up from Oklahoma, happy to be getting his hookers paid for by tobacco lobbyists, but not me.
C: LINTON
D: What seems to be the problem?
C: MALCOLM
D: I've just had a briefing from a 9-year- old finalist in Americas got talent. I think he may have been a ventriloquist. Or possibly the fucking dummie.
C: LINTON
D: AJ? He is one of my top guys. Stanton College Prep, Harvard...he's smart and he's great at his job.
C: MALCOLM
D: His fucking briefing notes were written in Alphabetti Spaghetti. When I left I nearly tripped over his umbilical cord.
C: LINTON
D: I'm sorry if it troubles you that our people achieve excellence at a young age.
N: Simon is emerging. Linton takes Malcolm to one side, out of Simon's earshot.
C: LINTON
D: By the way, your prime minister informs me that he's tasked you with collating some fresh British intel for us.
E: CONT'D
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah, apparently your fucking master race of gifted toddlers can't quit get the job done in between breast feeds and playing with their power rangers. So yeah, we're getting some actual grown-ups to bail you out.
N: Simon gets closer. Linton moves in.
C: LINTON
D: Minister, thank you so much for your support and your recent "Climb the mountain of conflict" comment - great. We're going to run with that, it has great repeatability. Page 66
E: to Simon
N: CON TINUE D: (2)
C: SIMON
D: Thanks very much, but...it's all a bit complex really, in terms of my...
N: Linton pulls away, starts walking off.
C: LINTON
D: It's early days, my friend. All roads lead to Munich.
N: He smiles and walks off.
C: MALCOLM
D: What the fuck does that mean? `All roads lead to Munich'?
C: SIMON
D: Well it just means...I guess, I don't know what it means.
C: MALCOLM
D: `All roads lead to Munich'?
N: Malcolm is pissed off, looks around. He is not the centre of attention. He's feeling cut out.
C: MALCOLM
D: Come on let's go, get back to the hotel, nick as many coat hangers as you can. We're off back to London.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. WASHINGTON STREET
N: Malcolm, Toby, and Simon are heading towards their car. They see the Washington Monument in the distance.
C: SIMON
D: It's beautiful.
C: TOBY
D: If you pull it out, America deflates.
C: MALCOLM
D: Don't mock that! The closest you'll come to getting one of those is buying a Toblerone. Mark Hadley's dad's died.
E: Looks at Blackberry
C: SIMON
D: Oh no. Should we send Mark a card?
C: MALCOLM
D: Nah, I'll send him a ouija board so they can keep in touch.
N: Page 67 CON TINUE D:

S: INT. CONSTITUENCY OFFICE. DAY.
N: TOBY and SIMON are with Simon's constituency agent, ROZ, she's ushering them into the small, damp little constituency office. ROZ's arm is in a sling (Jo Scanlon's arm actually is in a sling) and she has difficulty opening the door
C: ROZ
D: Sorry, could you...? You just need to kick the bottom quite hard.
E: to Simon
N: Simon kicks the bottom of the door to unstick it. Roz opens the door. There are a few constituents waiting to see Simon, he nods a hello.
C: SIMON
D: Look at them. They all have that smell....like a charity shop, you know? Afternoon!
E: Roz has gone ahead, this is to Toby to constituents
N: A couple of the waiting constituents respond. They go through to another little office.
C: ROZ
D: Right, here you go, you're pretty booked up - there's a list on the desk. I'm just going to have a look at the guttering.
C: SIMON
D: I'm just back from America, so it was pretty tough to make it up here - but you know. That's me.
C: ROZ
D: Of course. Right. How was the President? Page 68
N: CON TINUE D: She's heading off.

C: MILLER
D: Twelve-thirty.
E: by way of explanation
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: Um, hold on General ...
N: And into Linton's office. But - it's empty.
C: MILLER
D: What the fuck?
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: Yeah, Secretary Linton Barwick wanted me to let you know his last - meeting looks like it's over-running. He sends apologies.
N: Miller stands there for a beat. Very very annoyed.
C: MILLER
D: He stood me up? They're better be a fucking good reason. Like he's dead. That is just plain fucking rude. I mean, how would he like it if I just did a big hairy shit on his desk?
C: BOB ADRIANO
D: You're very w-welcome to wait, we have newspapers and periodicals? Page 69
N: CON TINUE D: He gestures to a seating area. Miller picks up a magazine. Rolls it up, looks at Bob Adriano. Might Miller, possibly, hit him?
C: MILLER
D: Yeah well excuse me if at this time of national crisis I don't sit with a thumb up my ass flipping through Time magazine eating pop tarts? Tell him to call me. But he might not get through cos I'm a fucking busy man.
E: he heads off fast - not quite sure where he's going, calls back as he goes
N: He finds himself heading into Karen's office. It's empty. He stands there for a beat. Shuts the door. Looks around. Picks up a hole punch. Kicks the couch. Karen enters, surprised to find him there.
C: KAREN
D: Hey, what is it?
C: MILLER
D: Yeah - can I hang around in here for a while?
C: KAREN
D: Er. Sure. Why?
C: MILLER
D: Do I need a fucking reason? Linton's playing me like a fucking turkey drumstick on a big bass drum.
E: beat, calming down
C: KAREN
D: Look, I was going to order food, do you want to eat.
C: MILLER
D: Yeah. Order us some cute mammals. Alive. A lamb or a piglet so I can snap it's fucking neck.

C: MRS MCDAIRMID
D: My point is - if the septic tank - if we didn't know it was there in the first place how can we be responsible for it now?
C: SIMON
D: Yes. No. I understand.
C: MRS MCDAIRMID
D: It's under the communal drive. Why should we get it pumped?
C: ROZ
D: Well it's not a council sceptic tank so they're not legally obliged to pump it...
E: looking through the paperwork
C: MRS MCDAIRMID
D: Look, according to the paperwork there's four metric tons of of shit under there. That's not all me, is it? I'm not a flipping elephant am I?
C: SIMON
D: No, of course not. Nor should you be treated like one. Okay, Mrs McDairmid. Leave it with me. I'm sure there must be a way through this. Alright?
N: Mrs Kendrick heads out.
C: ROZ
D: Er, Colin Lowe.
C: SIMON
D: Jesus. Still on about bendy buses? No. Tell him no. What else?
E: thinks
N: Toby closes the laptop.

C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: I know I have.
C: SIMON
D: Lovely.
C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: Okay, Simon, I'll try to keep it brief because I can see you're a busy man. There's a bloke out there wants to make it illegal to talk in a foreign language in shops.
C: SIMON
D: Yes, well, this place can become a magnet for the mentally dispossessed. And for sensible people like yourself, Paul.
C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: Patronising.
C: ROZ
D: Why don't you explain your issue, Mr Michaelson?
C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: I...sorry, is this a joke? How many times? For the fourth f...ing time. The side wall. Of this property. Your wall. Is falling over. On to my mum's garden. She called you up - but she got fobbed off by your people. Because she's not Lord Snooty in his posh car. Because she's not Madonna on a horse.
E: as to an idiot
C: SIMON
D: That...I agree, it's unacceptable.
N: Toby comes back in, hands Simon a coffee.
C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: Do you know what this is? That's your constituency office hold music. I don't want it in my head, do I?
E: he hums something irritating
C: SIMON
D: We did arrange to get a quote from a builder, but...
E: checks notes
N: Roz has a call on the landline. Page 72 CON TINUE D: (3)

D: Patch from London. They say it's urgent. Karen Clark? Is she the coracle woman?
C: SIMON
D: Right. Paul, I really need to take this, but I haven't forgotten about you, okay?
C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: No, well I'm not going anywhere, Simon. You won't be able to forget me because I'll be sitting here staring at you.
C: SIMON
D: Toby, can I hand Paul over to you?
C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: "Can I fob Paul off with you?"
N: Simon goes elsewhere in the room to take his call.

E: off Paul's scary look
N: He grabs a pen and paper.
S: INT. KAREN'S OFFICE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: (CHANGE SCENE ORDER) Later. General Miller is with Karen. They're surrounded by cartons of Chinese take-out.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: See, this is the problem with civilians wanting to go to war. When you've been there you don't want to go back unless you absolutely have to. It's like France.
E: flicking through Liza's paper
C: KAREN
D: You finally read Liza's paper?
E: re the paper in it's red folder
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Course, I read it. I'm a voracious reader. I'm the fucking Gore Vidal of the Pentagon. You don't want that?
E: pointing at a spring roll
N: Page 73 CON TINUE D:
C: KAREN
D: Yes I want that. I want that, that, that, that and that. Those I don't care about. And these let's pack up and drop on North Korea.
E: points to various packages
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Someone should leak this.
E: beat, reads
N: Outside Liza sees them discussing her paper animatedly. It doesn't look good to her.
C: KAREN
D: Someone maybe shaped a little bit like you.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Me? Are you kidding?
C: KAREN
D: You have more gravitas.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Exactly. I'm too senior. I can't leak. Leaking is for people like your Liza and the Boy called It out there. It's insane. Not only is the case against war incredibly strong, the case for is caveated to hell. "Most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders..." Then here in the caveats, the only source is `Ice Man' - a possible alcoholic - who's probably called that cos he gets through ten bags / icebergs a day in his fucking vodka tonics. INR say we can't trust him. That's us disputing our own findings. Has Linton read this?
E: eats reading
C: KAREN
D: I'm not sure he reads. You're a General. Have him killed.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: You see this is why we never got together. That and the hobo teeth.

C: SIMON
D: Departmental business. About a wall.
C: KAREN
D: Gaza?
C: SIMON
D: Uh-huh. What can I do for you?
C: KAREN
D: Where were you in the committee? I called for back-up, you sat there like a dumb sack of shit. Maybe worse, cos at a molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy.
C: SIMON
D: Well - okay. Yes. Um. Well, I have to say Karen, I have a clear strategy here. I'm playing the long game.
C: KAREN
D: There is no long game. They've bounced us into a short game. You looked like a...what do you call it in England? A 'wanker

C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: I'm going to pursue this with, what do they call it? Extreme prejudice, to the very end. I can be enormously persistent. Ask my ex-girlfriend.

D: Okay, well, I'll take your details. Roz leads Paul away
C: SIMON
D: That guy's a bit full-beam.
C: TOBY
D: Full-beam?

C: TOBY
D: You fucker. No, not you.
E: CONT'D to phone
N: Malcolm pushes Judy back into Simon's office as she's leaving it, Simon behind Judy walks backwards to his desk, the three of them in a line. Malcolm shuts the door and unleashes a torrent of abuse we can't hear.

C: PAUL MICHAELSON
D: She needs to get to her plants. She has to water them. Plants need water.
E: like Toby's an idiot
C: TOBY
D: No, sure, but could she use a hose, from a distance?
C: PAUL MICHAELSON

E: CONT'D
C: SIMON
D: What the fuck, Malcolm. This is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war. We fight people, and kill them, and our kids get killed, and that's exactly the sort of thing I didn't want to do when I went into politics. That's the opposite of what I want to be doing.
C: MALCOLM
D: That's why you've got to stay in Government. In here you can influence things, delay things. Out there you're just another mad shouty fucker people don't want to make eye-contact with. Remember Mary? She took a stand over Health. Everyone decided she was mental.
C: SIMON
D: Only because the Sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow.
C: MALCOLM
D: I found that a very powerful image. Look, the Prime Minister of this country is not a Viking. He doesn't drink blood, he doesn't go round biting tramps. He doesn't go to Chequers at the weekend for a bit of light raping and a pub lunch.

D: Listen, We've got evidence harder than a diamond dildo. We have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking puncture your kidneys.There's an informant, `Ice Man', OK? The stuff he's giving us? It'll make your blood run cold. And clot. Your insides will turn to black pudding. ...now, certain box-lickers are sitting on it. But you're going to see it, because the PM regards you as a key player now. Judy's mobile goes.
E: lowering his voice
C: JUDY
D: Judy Molloy? Ten minutes. Thanks. Prime Minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes, Simon. He want you to go the UN.
E: BEAT to Simon
N: Malcolm's heading out.
C: MALCOLM
D: See- you're A-list now. You're a Kennedy. In the VIP lounge, with the gold card and the complimentary drinks and the hard-on.
N: Malcolm leaves. A beat.
C: SIMON
D: Show me the evidence, Malcolm, that's my fucking bottom line.
E: shouting to Malcolm
C: JUDY

N: Simon nods a little nod. Then shakes his head slightly. Then nods a slight nod again.
S: INT. WESTMINSTER PUB - DAY
N: Suzy, Michael and Judy are having a drink in a pub. Maybe they're sitting in a four seater booth? Page 86 CON TINUE D: Their phones are on the table. As is a bottle of Sancerre. Judy's got her power walking trainers on and her rucksack with her.
C: MICHAEL
D: Cheers everyone. Here's to surviving another day.
N: They clink glasses.
C: JUDY
D: My theory is Malcolm built Jamie in a lab out of bits of old psychopath.
N: Toby arrives, dumps his coat, bag, puts his phone on the table.
C: TOBY
D: Hello ladies.
C: SUZY
D: And gentleman.
C: TOBY
D: Hello ladies. I'm just going to -

C: TOBY
D: Great.
C: SUZY

C: JUDY
D: If you can get served at the bar.
N: He goes to the bar. His phone gets a text. Suzy picks it up, reads it.
C: SUZY
D: Fucking hell. Here we go again. Fucking arsehole.
C: MICHAEL

E: peering at the phone
N: Suzy shows the phone to Judy.

E: beat
N: CON TINUE D: (2) Suzy's texting on Toby's mobile. Toby's coming back. Suzy puts the phone back down.
C: TOBY
D: Yeah I wouldn't want to meet Jamie in a dark alley. Or a bright alley. The whole thing of just being in an alley with him would be scary, regardless of the lighting.
T: Suzy cuts in.
C: SUZY
D: You've got a text.
C: TOBY
D: Oh yeah. It's just Rob about football.
E: reading, covering
C: SUZY

D: What? No.
C: SUZY
D: Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been getting his flakey end away?
E: to Judy
C: JUDY
D: I don't know anything about his flakey end.
C: TOBY
D: Could we not talk about accusations and, health issues, in the pub?
C: JUDY
D: I should go.
C: SUZY
D: You haven't finished your drink.
C: JUDY
D: No. I mainly have.
C: SUZY
D: Why did you do it?
C: TOBY
D: I don't know, it was a weird, intense time over there. It was...maybe, subconsciously, I don't know, it was a kind of last ditch attempt to stop this, awful...war.
N: Page 88 CON TINUE D: (3) A beat. Michael and Judy dissolve into laughter.
C: MICHAEL
D: That's classic. That's definitely going in the memoirs.
C: SUZY
D: You had sex because of the war?
C: TOBY
D: In the broad sense. Sorry, can you stop doing that? Can we go somewhere where they're aren't enormous children eating snacks?
E: to Judy and Michael
C: JUDY
D: I should go.
C: SUZY
D: Actually I'll go.
N: She goes. Toby goes after her.

S: INT. TOBY'S FLAT - EVENING

C: SUZY
D: What?! What the fuck are you doing here?
C: TOBY
D: Well I live here.
C: SUZY
D: No you don't actually. I'll go make that tea.

D: No, it's fine. Stay.
S: INT. TOBY'S FLAT - LATER
N: Toby is in the bedroom. A few boxes are lying around. He's putting clothes into bin liners. Suzy is hovering. Michael brings through some teas. The atmosphere is very frosty and awkward.
C: TOBY
D: Where's my needlecord jacket?
C: SUZY
D: Your geography teacher's jacket?
N: Toby thinks better of responding. Starts folding some shirts. Michael takes over
C: MICHAEL
D: That's not how you fold.
C: TOBY
D: Michael, this is one of the more humiliating moments of my life. I can pack a bag.
C: MICHAEL
D: The key to travelling is packing.
C: TOBY
D: I'm not going to fucking Fiji Michael, I'm being chucked out of my house.
C: MICHAEL
D: It'll save time the other end.
C: TOBY
D: There is no other end.
N: Toby moves through to the kitchen to get his jeans. Suzy and Michael follow. Page 90 CON TINUE D:
C: SUZY
D: Has she got big tits?
C: TOBY
D: Massive. Enormous. You can see them on Google Earth. They've got their own postcode.
N: Toby gets his jeans and some other clothes. He's laden down with boxes and bags and can hardly see. Comes out into the hall. Suzy is there without Michael.
C: TOBY
D: See you then.
E: CONT'D
C: SUZY
D: Okay.
N: Toby struggles to open the front door. Suzy opens it. Toby goes to leave then stops.
C: TOBY
D: Look, Suzy, this is probably going to sound odd under the circumstances.
C: SUZY
D: Quickie?
C: TOBY
D: No. Thank you. But no. It's about Liza.
C: SUZY
D: Oh good tell me more, tell me more about her tits.
C: TOBY
D: Listen, Suze, Liza wrote a paper, Pwip- Pip. I think, if it got leaked, it could stop the war.
N: He holds out the memory stick.
C: MICHAEL
D: Good tactic. Get earnest. I tried that with the wife. Didn't work.
C: SUZY
D: You are such a fucking coward, you know that? And this is what? A make up leak?
C: TOBY
D: Does such a thing exist?
N: Page 91 CON TINUE D: (2)
C: SUZY
D: Toby, take your rubbish clothes and your back issues of Mojo, your flute, and your eighth of dope and leave me the fuck alone.
N: Toby leaves the memory stick in the flat. Then heads out.
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Simon, Toby and Judy are on the way to Heathrow.
C: SIMON
D: Should I resign? I've floated that I might, when I thought I wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if I did. I mean, do you think, is it braver to just resign and say, `No, no war'?
C: JUDY
D: Yes.
C: SIMON
D: Or is it actually braver to say, `I don't agree, but I'm going to grit my teeth and get on with it?' Is the really brave thing actually doing what you don't believe?
C: JUDY
D: No.
C: TOBY
D: Though -- maybe? What's brave about doing the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the wrong thing is braver. In a way. I mean, you know, wars sometimes work. The War of Independence, that worked. For the Americans. Second World War. That was a good idea. I mean not a good idea but ...
C: SIMON
D: I know what you mean. And the Crimean War -- we got nurses out of that.
C: TOBY
D: Nurses are good.
C: SIMON
D: Exactly. So...right. Exactly.
E: as if they've achieved something
C: JUDY
D: So you're not resigning?

S: INT. AIRPORT ARRIVALS - DAY

E: conspiratorially to Toby
C: TOBY
D: You want hookers? You like hooky fucky?
C: SIMON
D: I want to talk about the resigning thing.
C: TOBY
D: Still?
C: SIMON
D: But with you and not her. She has this air of moral righteousness that inhibits you from... saying anything morally wrong.
S: INT. LIMO - DAY
N: Simon and Toby looking very uptight. Malcolm's with them.
C: MALCOLM
D: So. The wires are all currently reporting that you're going to resign from government over the war.
E: looking at phone
C: SIMON
D: What? That wasn't supposed to get outside.
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah well it is outside. It's lurking outside like a big hairy rapist at a coach station.
N: Simon looks to Toby for help.
C: MALCOLM
D: Do you know, if I could I'd punch you into total paralysis.
E: CONT'D
N: Page 93
S: INT. UN BUILDING - DAY
N: Malcolm, Simon, Toby and Judy are being led through a bleak, soulless basement corridor in the UN by Sir Jonathan Tutt, the British ambassador to the UN.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: Hello, gentlemen, Sir Jonathan Tutt. This is it. The United Nations.
C: SIMON
D: It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it?
C: JUDY
D: It could do with a few more scatter cushions and a bit less asbestos.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: I don't know what you were expecting -- Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of stonework tracery... great fountains...
C: MALCOLM
D: It's a shithole. It looks like a hospice for robots.
N: They pass a big office.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: Linton Barwick is in there. Karen Clark is there. You're right here.
N: Sir Jonathan shows them to their office.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: If you need anything, just whistle. You know how to whistle don't you Malcolm? You just put your lips together and blow.
E: CONT'D
N: Malcolm and Toby look at one another.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: Right. I'm off upstairs to the informal delegates' reception. Hope there's nibbles, I'm ravenous.
E: CONT'D
N: Sir Jonathan leaves.
C: MALCOLM
D: Nibbles? Who still says nibbles?
C: TOBY
D: Fuck the nibbles, what was with the homoerotic tension?
N: Malcolm gets a call. Page 94 CON TINUE D:
C: MALCOLM
D: Jamie. Hello?
N: He looks at his phone.
C: MALCOLM
D: No fucking signal down here. Jesus. I'd be better off in an internet cafe in Kircoddy.
E: CONT'D
N: He leaves the room.
S: INT. NUMBER 10 - SAME TIME
N: Jamie is on the phone, running down a corridor.
C: JAMIE
D: Okay, your phone's off, which means you've been shot dead by a fat American, but there's been a fucktastrophe. Someone's leaked Liza Weld's Pwip Pip paper to the BBC. I reckon it'll be on the Six O'Clock news here, one o'clock your time, so it's going to fist your fucking vote apart. Missing you loads, pwip-pip, toodle-oo!
S: EXT. UN BUILDING - DAY
N: Malcolm finishing listening to his voicemail, dialling and running back into the building, pushing past a crowd of smokers at the doorway.
C: MALCOLM
D: Okay Jamie, two jobs. One: find the Pwip Pip leaker and kill them. That's one job. Job one has two parts. Job two: stop Pwip Pip coming out. Sow enough seeds of fear and doubt that the fat arses at the BBC dither till after the vote, okay? After the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take- off and everything is groovy. I love you.
S: INT. UN FUNCTION ROOM/BAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting. We glimpse Linton, Karen, General Miller. Sir Jonathan is there, mingling. Malcolm approaches Simon, Toby, Judy and Sir Jonathan. Page 95 CON TINUE D:

D: Hm?
C: MALCOLM
D: Was it you?
E: to Simon
C: SIMON
D: No, what? No.
C: MALCOLM
D: But you know what I'm talking about?
C: SIMON
D: No, but whatever it was I didn't do it.
C: MALCOLM
D: Was it you, The-Baby-From-Eraserhead?
E: to Toby
C: TOBY
D: No.
C: MALCOLM
D: So it must have been you Woman from The Crying Game?
E: to Judy
C: JUDY
D: It wasn't me. You've really got it in for me haven't you?
C: MALCOLM
D: Someone's dropped a bollock in the noodles and I reckon it was you.
C: JUDY
D: We've done this all before. You accused me of leaking last time and it wasn't me.
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah well I know you didn't leak last time. But what I reckon is you got so pissy about being accused, you leaked this time.
C: TOBY
D: Yeah. Yeah, that does sound possible.
C: JUDY
D: Look Springer Spaniel, keep your little wet nose out alright? Page 96
N: CON TINUE D: (2)
C: TOBY
D: I'm just saying psychologically speaking that sounds plausible - that you might build up a resentment and then pay it off in some underhand way. That's just something I've observed.
N: Malcolm's had enough goes over and grabs Sir Jonathan, mid-conversation, and manhandles him away.
C: MALCOLM
D: Come on, Baldermort, I need a word.
N: Meanwhile Judy and Toby are left alone - Toby embarrassed about his comments.
C: TOBY
D: Sorry about that - it's just ... something I've observed.
E: they look at each other mumbles
C: JUDY
D: Wanker. It's okay. It's fine. It's probably just the stress of this awful, awful war.
N: Malcolm drags the ambassador into a corner.
C: MALCOLM
D: We're in a new reality now and You've got to speed things up.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: What things? Speed up what?
C: MALCOLM
D: The debate. It needs to start at eleven o'clock, not one thirty.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: Hehe. Can I perhaps briefly explain the way the process works? And why that isn't possible? You see through that door there are a number of secretariats that are currently doing what we call the washing up now...
C: MALCOLM
D: Just fucking do it, fishlips. Otherwise you'll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the Caucasus with your arse in the air, trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that sustained sexual violence is not the way forward.
N: Page 97 CON TINUE D: (3)
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: No, it can't be. I mean it could be done, it just can't.
C: MALCOLM
D: Then I'll do it. They're through there?
E: motioning to a door
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: Yes but you can't go in, that would be a serious breach of protocol ...
N: He's blocking Malcolm. Malcolm grabs his hand.
C: MALCOLM
D: Then you do it. Get in there.
N: He is almost man-handling him in.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: I'm not dancing with you Malcolm.
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm leading, look follow my lead.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: You're not dancing me into the secretariat!
N: Jonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to go in. As Malcolm is leaving Miller blocks his path.
C: MALCOLM
D: Where's the intel? Are you sure you're working as hard as me? Cos I'm sweating spinal fluid here. I'm a husk.
C: MILLER
D: You get everything you need?
C: MALCOLM
D: Oh yeah I think so. Thanks. Oh, Whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment General Flintstone. Was it you? Did you leak Pwip Pip? I know you can't fire a gun, but can you use a fax?
E: in a hurry a beat, thinks
C: MILLER
D: No, see, because I'm upfront about what I do. I don't creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other people's dirty work. Page 98
N: CON TINUE D: (4)
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm doing my own work. I'm doing my job.
C: MILLER
D: Uh-hu. I think you're doing Linton's dirty work. I think you're his English bitch and if I walked into your hotel room tonight I'd find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of you.
C: MALCOLM
D: Oooo. Tough talk from the armchair General. What you going to do? Throw a cushion at me? Put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why don't you?
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Listen, Tucker, you may be some scary poodlefucker back in London, but here? You know what you look like? A fucking squeezed dick. You got a blue vein running all the way up to your temple there. That's where I'd put the fucking bullet. But I'd stand well back. You look like you'd be a squirter.
C: MALCOLM
D: Have you ever even killed anybody? Really?
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Yep.
C: MALCOLM
D: Falling asleep on someone doesn't count.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: I've done my share. How many you kill, pussy drip?
E: closer
C: MALCOLM
D: Personally, I prefer maiming.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Go on, tough guy, take a swing at me. I'll smack you so fucking hard you'll be shitting teeth.
C: MALCOLM
D: Go ahead. I can see the headlines now. 'Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In UN, Swiss Intervene'. I don't know, I'm no expert on spin but could that hurt your career?
N: Page 99 CON TINUE D: (5) They eyeball each other. Is Miller going to hit him? He doesn't.
C: MALCOLM
D: Right. Do excuse me. I've got work to do. Oh, and don't EVER call me fucking English again.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. UN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Sir Jonathan walks in. A lot of faces are turned towards him, expectantly.
C: SIR JONATHAN

S: INT. KAREN CLARK'S UN OFFICE - DAY
N: Karen and Miller are looking at a computer screen, presumably reading about Simon's floated resignation.

C: GENERAL MILLER
D: You're not resigning?
C: KAREN
D: You're still playing the hawk?

C: SIMON
D: Fake hawk.

N: Karen and Miller go into a confab. Karen and Miller immediately go into a huddle and start planning Simon's future.
C: KAREN
D: We could just tell the press he's going anyway. Say he's confirmed to us that he's resigning.
E: to General Miller, as if Simon's not there
C: SIMON
D: Sorry?
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: I second that.
C: SIMON
D: What? You can't.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Do we announce it before or after the vote?
C: KAREN
D: During. Then he can't do anything about it.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Great. That's decided then.
C: SIMON
D: No. No it's bloody not. I'm - me. You're not me. I decide about all the main things about me, okay? Not you. Me.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: No. No Simon. I'm afraid not. Not on this one. This is too big for you.
C: KAREN

E: considers then,  kick kick
N: Jamie is heading off.
C: MICHAEL
D: Well, you know -- better to go out with a bang...

D: Okay, quick reality check, J Edgar Fucking Hoover. I don't work for you. You don't tell me what to fucking do.
C: LINTON
D: Well firstly, don't raise your voice. This is a sacred space. You may not believe that, I may not believe that, but by God it's a useful hypocrisy. And secondarily you do work for me. Your prime minister instructed you to work for me.
N: Malcolm glances at Simon.
C: MALCOLM
D: Get your Polos and fuck off.
N: Simon stays where he is. Linton starts laughing. Toby enters, watches in amazement.
C: LINTON
D: The great Malcolm Tucker. One of your guys has leaked a paper, you can't do anything. We tell you to get intel, you can't do anything. I need the vote put back - you can't do anything. You, sir, are a useless piece of `S' star star `T'.
N: A beat.
C: MALCOLM
D: What do you want?
E: quietly, to Toby
C: TOBY
D: We've just heard -- the wall's starting to collapse. A brick has fallen. That's the news I'm getting. More to follow. Both news and bricks.
N: Linton laughs again.
C: LINTON
D: Why don't you deal with that Tucker? A wall is falling down, that's more your level. I can see you with your shirt off and a wheelbarrow whistling a happy song.
N: Linton walks out. Page 107 CON TINUE D: (2)
C: SIMON
D: You've been working for him?
C: MALCOLM
D: It's complicated, okay? I've been juggling a number of responsibilities.
N: Simon stares at Malcolm. He takes a mint and pops it in his mouth.
C: SIMON
D: Okay, well, right, after the vote, I resign.
C: MALCOLM
D: Look. It's too late now. Resigning. It's not worth it. The horse has bolted. It's out there getting shot now.
C: SIMON
D: I'll see you later, Malcolm.
N: Simon exits.
C: MALCOLM
D: If you repeat this to anyone I will pull your leg off, break it in two and stab you to death with your broken shin bone. Now go away.

S: INT. FOREIGN OFFICE - SAME TIME
N: Michael and Suzy in Michael's office, classical music in the background. Michael's clearing his desk, putting stuff in boxes. Jamie bursts in on Michael and Suzy, his phone still on.
C: JAMIE
D: Right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra. I've got good news. You're not fired. That's great news, isn't it?
C: MICHAEL
D: That sounds ominous.

E: cancels phone

D: Take out the cons, change the name of the main informant.
C: MICHAEL
D: That's a complete fabrication.
N: Page 109 CON TINUE D:
C: JAMIE
D: Changing his name doesn't make a difference. The main source in there he's not really called Ice Man, is he? "Mr and Mrs Man, you've got a son, Ice." So we change it, to another name. Who's the fuck with the fiddle? The Fiddlefuck.
C: MICHAEL
D: This is Debussy, if that's what you mean.
C: JAMIE
D: Okay, we'll call him Debussy.
C: MICHAEL
D: No.
C: JAMIE
D: And then you'll make a couple of other changes. It'll mean your fingerprints are on it, Mikey, but it's the only way to save your job, you leaky fuck.
N: Michael is now scared of what he's being asked to do.
C: MICHAEL
D: It wasn't me, Jamie, alright? It wasn't me. Don't make me do this. Someone else must have come in and used the fax machine.
C: JAMIE
D: What? Oh, that thing about your fax? Don't worry about that. I made that up. The paper was sent by e-mail. It;s just, the fax machine was there and it;s easier to kick.
N: Michael looks at Suzy. She doesn't know what to say or do.
C: JAMIE
D: Come on Deuce Bigalow. You're coming with me.
E: CONT'D grabbing Michael
N: He drags Michael out of the office.

C: MALCOLM
D: I just want to say please, this garden wall story, please don't run with it. Simon Foster's constituency-office wall? You've got that haven't you? I haven't let the cat out of the bag? Shit. Look, my reputation will be in tatters if you run with... And he's gone. Boo hoo. I've got a hard on.

C: MALCOLM
D: Great. I need it delayed now.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: Very funny. That is funny.
C: MALCOLM
D: By an hour, at least. Although I guess two and a half hours now, as you've brought it forward.
C: SIR JONATHAN
D: No, I'm sorry I'm very sorry but I won't humiliate myself again.

D: You do what I say or you can go and see if Belize are looking for a new ambassador but with a broken nose, one bollock, and a half-chewed cock.

C: MALCOLM
D: Have you tried hitting him? Give him a thump, that usually works.
C: JAMIE
D: Hang on, I think I might be able to use manual over-ride.

C: LINTON
D: What, you did your job? Eventually? Congratulations. Maybe they'll give you a knighthood.
C: MALCOLM
D: It's been a pleasure working with you. You know, I've met some psychos in my time, but none as fucking BORING as you. Oh sorry, that's right. You disapprove of swearing. A boring F star star CUNT!

D: No. That old thing? That was like a thousand years ago. More maybe.

C: GENERAL MILLER
D: It is - it is intolerable. I still agree with myself about that. But I've got to tolerate it. My loyalty is with the kids. At the end of the day I'm a soldier.
C: KAREN
D: You're not a soldier.
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: Look at the uniform, Karen. I'm not a pastry chef. I have military commendations on my chest, not a little fucking label saying My Name Is George.

D: I'm still a soldier.
C: KAREN
D: When was the last time you shot a guy?
C: GENERAL MILLER
D: What, if I haven't shot a guy in 15 years then I'm not a soldier? City hall don't insist I bring along a fucking bullet- ridden corpse every five years to renew my soldier licence.
