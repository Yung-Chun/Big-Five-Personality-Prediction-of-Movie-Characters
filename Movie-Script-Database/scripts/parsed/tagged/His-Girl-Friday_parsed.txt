M: SHOOTING DRAFT
S: FADE IN: INT. ANTEROOM CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD
N: Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in and out answering calls.
C: 1ST OPERATOR
D: This is the Morning Post... The City Room? Just a moment, I'll connect you.
E: plugs in call
C: 2ND OPERATOR
D: Morning Post... Sports Department? Just a moment --
E: plugs in call
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it again from the city room which stretches on beyond switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock. CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY as he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of a crossword puzzle. MED. SHOT as a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to behind him. The office boy looks up.
C: OFFICE BOY
D: What's a seven-letter word for --?
C: REPORTER
D: Don't ask me! If I knew any seven- letter words, I'd be something better than a reporter!
N: He catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down.
C: REPORTER
D: Hey! Down! Down!
N: MED. SHOT ELEVATORS as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds on it. It comes back, the door opens, and he gets in. The door closes, as elevator goes down. The near elevator comes up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin. Bruce carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat. MED. CLOSE SHOT TABLE office boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come into the scene.
C: HILDY
D: Hello, Skinny. Remember me?
E: with a smile
C: OFFICE BOY
D: Hildy Johnson!
E: looks up; then a glowing smile
N: CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD Hildy approaches the switchboard.
C: HILDY
D: Hello, Maisie.
E: to operator
N: The first operator looks up.
C: MAISIE
D: Hello -- Hildy! You coming back?
C: HILDY
D: No, just visiting. Tell me, is the lord of the universe in today?
C: MAISIE
D: He is -- and in a very bad humor. I think somebody stole one of his crown jewels. Shall I announce you?
C: HILDY
D: No, never mind -- I'll blow my own trumpet.
N: THREE SHOT BRUCE, HILDY AND OPERATOR Hildy turns to Bruce.
C: HILDY
D: I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
C: BRUCE
D: Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
N: We hear a giggle off scene. CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY He looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles. TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY
C: HILDY
D: What did you say, Bruce?
N: Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City Room.
C: BRUCE
D: I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
C: HILDY
D: Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
C: BRUCE
D: I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
E: grimly
C: HILDY
D: My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
C: BRUCE
D: I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
C: HILDY
D: I'll come a-running, pardner.
N: She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it for her. Hildy smiles.
C: HILDY
D: Thanks, Bruce.
N: She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her. The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares after Hildy. MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM Hildy starts to walk through City Room. TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: "Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop" "Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.
C: HILDY
D: Hello, Beatrice. How's "Advice to the Lovelorn"?
C: BEATRICE
D: Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle! What are you doing here?
E: looking up
C: HILDY
D: Point of information -- what does a girl say on meeting her divorced husband? OR:
E: What does a girl do, etc.
C: BEATRICE
D: My advice is duck and cross with your right.
E: illustrating
N: Hildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the City Room.
S: INT. BURNS' OFFICE LONG SHOT
N: as she opens the door. Burns is shaving with an electric razor and Louie is holding the mirror up in front of him. CLOSE SHOT BURNS shaving, Louie holding the mirror.
C: LOUIE
D: A little more round the chin, Boss.
N: MEDIUM SHOT There is a sound of the door closing and Burns, without looking up, says:
C: BURNS
D: What do you want?
C: HILDY
D: Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
C: BURNS
D: Hello, Hildy!
E: grinning
C: HILDY
D: Hello, Walter. Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
E: to Louie
C: LOUIE
D: Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
C: HILDY
D: Editorials?
C: BURNS
D: Get going, Louie. I got company.
N: The door flies open and Duffy comes busting in.
C: DUFFY
D: Walter!
C: BURNS
D: I'm busy, Duffy.
C: DUFFY
D: Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
C: BURNS
D: What?
C: DUFFY
D: And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
C: BURNS
D: You're crazy. Where's Mac?
C: DUFFY
D: He's on my phone. He just called me.
C: BURNS
D: They can't do that to me!
N: He grabs the phone on his desk:
C: BURNS
D: Give me that call on Duffy's wire! Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the Governor? -- What do you mean, you can't locate him? Mac, you know what this means. We're the only paper in town defending Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow we're washed up! Find the Governor and when you find him tell him we want that reprieve!... Tell him I elected him and I can have him impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac -- I know you can. I always said you were the greatest reporter in the country and now you can prove it. Get going! Attaboy!
E: apparently pleading to the one man in the world who can help him
N: He hangs up.
C: BURNS
D: The greatest reporter in the country! First I gotta tell him what news to get! Gotta tell him how to get it -- then I gotta write it for him afterward! Now if you were a decent City Editor --
E: to Duffy, sarcastically
N: CLOSE SHOT DUFFY AND BURNS with Louie and Hildy in the b.g.
C: DUFFY
D: Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
C: BURNS
D: Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
N: MEDIUM SHOT
C: HILDY
D: I don't like to interfere with business, but would you boys pardon us while we have a little heart-to- heart talk?
C: DUFFY AND LOUIE
D: Well -- But I gotta --
E: together
N: They look at Burns.
C: BURNS
D: Scram, you guys.
N: They start to go.
C: HILDY
D: You won't miss anything. You'll probably be able to hear him just as well outside as here.
N: They go.
C: HILDY
D: Mind if I sit down?
N: Hildy sits. CLOSE SHOT DUFFY AND LOUIE going out of the door. They cast an interested look back and linger a second. Over scene comes Burns' voice.
C: BURNS' VOICE
D: I said scram!
N: They close the door hurriedly. MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY
C: HILDY
D: May I have a cigarette, please?
N: Burns reaches into his pocket, extracts a cigarette and tosses it on the desk. Hildy reaches for it.
C: HILDY
D: Thanks. A match?
N: Burns delves into pockets again, comes up with matchbox, tosses it to Hildy, who catches it deftly, and strikes the match.
C: BURNS
D: How long is it?
N: Hildy finishes lighting her cigarette, takes a puff, and fans out the match.
C: HILDY
D: How long is what?
C: BURNS
D: You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
C: HILDY
D: Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
N: CLOSEUP BURNS
C: BURNS
D: Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
E: slyly
N: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT THE TWO
C: HILDY
D: No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
E: casually
C: BURNS
D: Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
E: with conviction
N: He grows lyrical and, rising from his seat, is about to start toward her, as he continues:
C: BURNS AND HILDY
D: -- any place, anywhere --
E: together
N: He sits.
C: HILDY
D: You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed. "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
E: half-pityingly she burlesques his fervor
N: CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND BURNS
C: BURNS
D: I notice you still remember it.
E: growling
C: HILDY
D: I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
C: BURNS
D: You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
C: HILDY
D: Done what?
C: BURNS
D: Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
C: HILDY
D: Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
C: BURNS
D: Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
C: HILDY
D: I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
C: BURNS
D: Now, that's a nice thing to say.
C: HILDY
D: Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
C: BURNS
D: Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE
C: HILDY
D: A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
E: she gestures above to indicate sky- writing
C: BURNS
D: Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
C: HILDY
D: What home?
C: WALTER
D: What home? Don't you remember the home I promised you?
C: HILDY
D: Oh, yes -- we were to have it right after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!
C: BURNS
D: Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
C: HILDY
D: All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
C: BURNS
D: Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
C: HILDY
D: Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
C: BURNS
D: Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
C: HILDY
D: What?!!
C: BURNS
D: I haven't any hard feelings.
C: HILDY
D: Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
C: BURNS
D: Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
E: rising, reaching for his hat
C: HILDY
D: I have a lunch date. I just want --
E: also rising
C: BURNS
D: You can break it, can't you?
C: HILDY
D: No, I can't.
C: BURNS
D: Sure you can. Come on.
N: DIFFERENT ANGLE
C: HILDY
D: Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
C: BURNS
D: What do you mean by that?
C: HILDY
D: Just what I said. That's what I --
C: BURNS
D: You mean you're not coming back to work here?
C: HILDY
D: That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
C: BURNS
D: You've had a better offer, eh?
E: still interrupting
C: HILDY
D: You bet I've got a better offer.
C: BURNS
D: Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
C: HILDY
D: I know, Walter, but I --
C: BURNS
D: What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
E: ignoring her
C: HILDY
D: You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
C: BURNS
D: Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
C: HILDY
D: Listen, Walter --
C: BURNS
D: I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
E: going right on
C: HILDY
D: Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
N: WIDER ANGLE
C: BURNS
D: It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
C: HILDY
D: I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
E: indignantly
C: BURNS
D: Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
C: HILDY
D: You -- you --
E: speechless
N: She grabs something and chucks it at him. He ducks. The phone rings.
C: BURNS
D: You're losing your eye. You used to be able to pitch better than that. Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well, what can I do for you?
E: to Hildy he reaches for phone
N: CLOSE SHOT DUFFY seated at his desk, talking into phone.
C: DUFFY
D: What's the matter with you? Are you drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney!
N: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY Burns into phone:
C: BURNS
D: Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to. How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
E: he hangs up
C: HILDY
D: What's the matter?
C: BURNS
D: Sweeney.
C: HILDY
D: Dead?
C: BURNS
D: Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
N: CLOSE SHOT HILDY
C: HILDY
D: Sweeney? Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
E: she laughs
N: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY
C: BURNS
D: I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
C: HILDY
D: Well, haven't you got anybody else?
E: practically
C: BURNS
D: There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless -- Hildy!
E: he stares at Hildy; then a light breaks
C: HILDY
D: No!
C: BURNS
D: You've got to help me, Hildy.
C: HILDY
D: Keep away --
C: BURNS
D: It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
C: HILDY
D: That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
C: BURNS
D: Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
C: HILDY
D: Get away, Svengali.
C: BURNS
D: If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
C: HILDY
D: Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
C: BURNS
D: All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
C: HILDY
D: Please! Will you just --
C: BURNS
D: Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
C: HILDY
D: I'm not working for any other paper!
C: BURNS
D: Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
C: HILDY
D: Look at this!
E: pulling her glove off her left hand
N: CLOSEUP HILDY She gets glove off left hand and holds up an engagement ring for him to see.
C: HILDY
D: Do you see this? Do you know what an engagement ring is?
N: CLOSEUP BURNS He looks at ring, swallows, then: MED. SHOT Burns and Hildy.
C: HILDY
D: I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
C: BURNS
D: Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
E: himself again
C: HILDY
D: You can't sell me that, Walter.
C: BURNS
D: Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
C: HILDY
D: That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
C: BURNS
D: I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
N: CLOSER SHOT
C: HILDY
D: A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
E: bitterly
C: BURNS
D: Where'd you meet this man?
C: HILDY
D: Bermuda.
C: BURNS
D: Bermuda... Rich, eh?
C: HILDY
D: Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
C: BURNS
D: What's his line?
C: HILDY
D: He's in the insurance business.
C: BURNS
D: The insurance business?
E: looks up
C: HILDY
D: It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
E: on the defensive
N: ANOTHER ANGLE
C: BURNS
D: Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
C: HILDY
D: Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
C: BURNS
D: He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
C: HILDY
D: I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
C: BURNS
D: Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
C: HILDY
D: Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
C: BURNS
D: Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
C: HILDY
D: The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you. So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
E: she extends her hand
C: BURNS
D: I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
E: taking her hand
C: HILDY
D: Thanks...
C: BURNS
D: Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
C: HILDY
D: Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
E: laughing
C: BURNS
D: Say, could I meet him?
C: HILDY
D: Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
C: BURNS
D: You're not afraid, are you?
C: HILDY
D: Afraid? I should say not!
C: BURNS
D: All right then, come on and let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
E: gets hat
C: HILDY
D: Better.
N: MED. SHOT OFFICE Burns has his hat. They start toward the door.
C: BURNS
D: Then what does he want with you?
C: HILDY
D: Now you got me.
E: laughing
C: BURNS
D: Nothing personal. I was just asking.
N: At the door, Burns walks ahead, opens door and walks out.
S: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS
C: BURNS
D: After all --
N: He stops as he realizes she's not there. The door opens. Hildy comes out.
C: HILDY
D: You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
C: BURNS
D: No kidding?
E: incredulous
S: INT. CITY ROOM FULL SHOT
N: Reporters conversing. They stop as Hildy and Burns enter scene. TRUCKING SHOT as Hildy follows Burns through the City Room. This time, in contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups are silent as they watch the two.
C: HILDY
D: And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
E: trying to keep pace
C: BURNS
D: What for?
E: over his shoulder
C: HILDY
D: And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
E: shouting
C: BURNS
D: Oh, I'm sorry.
E: stops
N: Burns, at this point, has reached the switchboard. He says, under his breath, to Maisie:
C: BURNS
D: Have Duffy call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes.
E: under his breath
N: Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens the gate and holds it for Burns.
C: HILDY
D: Allow me.
C: BURNS
D: Thanks.
E: walking right through
N: Hildy follows him out.
S: INT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT
N: as Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy". Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his hand, shakes it and says:
C: BURNS
D: I can see right away my wife picked out the right husband for herself.
N: CLOSE SHOT BRUCE Hildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER The messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping his hand vigorously.
C: MESSENGER
D: There must be some mistake. I'm already married.
C: BURNS
D: Already married! Hildy, why didn't you tell me?
E: you never saw a more surprised man turning to Hildy o.s.
N: CLOSEUP HILDY She shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling nevertheless. MEDIUM SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER
C: BURNS
D: Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!
E: again seizing messenger's hand
C: MESSENGER
D: But my name --
C: BRUCE
D: Mr. Burns!
E: as he enters scene
N: Burns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand.
C: BURNS
D: Yeah? You'll have to excuse me -- I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here. Just leave your card with the boy.
N: CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND BURNS Bruce takes hold of Burns' coat and shakes it to get his attention. Burns turns on him:
C: BURNS
D: I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look -- -- there's the boy. Take your card and leave it with him.
E: he points o.s.
N: He turns away again. Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his sleeve and pulls at it.
C: BRUCE
D: Mr. Burns --
C: BURNS
D: I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
E: wheeling around
C: BRUCE
D: I'm Bruce Baldwin!
N: MEDIUM SHOT Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce:
C: BURNS
D: You're Bruce Baldwin?
C: BRUCE
D: Yes!
C: BURNS
D: Then who are you?
E: accusing to messenger
C: MESSENGER
D: My name's Pete Davis.
E: falteringly
C: BURNS
D: Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is no concern of yours and after this I'll thank you to keep out of my affairs!
N: The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce. CLOSEUP HILDY She is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is compelled to smile at Walter's behavior. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND BRUCE
C: BURNS
D: This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
E: reaches for Bruce's hand but grabs the umbrella and begins shaking the handle up and down
C: BRUCE
D: 
E: he tries to shift the umbrella, calling Burns' attention to it, and offers his hand instead
C: BURNS
D: Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
C: BRUCE
D: Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
E: completely unnerved by this time, and you can't quite blame him
C: BURNS
D: You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh.
E: this is the final crusher
C: BURNS
D: But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
C: BRUCE
D: Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
C: BURNS
D: That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
N: Burns looks down. Bruce, in unconscious responses, helplessly lifts his foot up and we see the rubber.
C: BURNS
D: Attaboy! Come on, Bruce.
E: taking Bruce's arm and leading him toward elevator
C: BRUCE
D: Where are we going?
E: going along, but worried
C: BURNS
D: Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
C: BRUCE
D: No -- she didn't.
E: a helpless look back at Hildy
C: BURNS
D: Just wanted to surprise you, I guess. Down! After you, Bruce! Come on, Hildy, my treat!
E: as the elevator is about to pass, he calls practically shoving Bruce in as Bruce disappears inside he turns toward Hildy
N: CLOSE SHOT BURNS NEAR OPEN ELEVATOR We don't see the passengers. Hildy comes into scene.
C: HILDY
D: I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
C: BURNS
D: How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
E: hurt
N: He jumps into the elevator -- in a second he hops out.
C: BURNS
D: Oh -- after you, Hildy!
E: very sweetly -- he almost sings it
N: With a look of disgust Hildy gets in. Burns follows and the door slams on them. CLOSEUP OFFICE BOY He looks after departed elevator and whistles. Then he grins all over.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. RESTAURANT CLOSEUP - A BEAMING WAITER
N: HE GRINS ALL OVER AND SAYS:
C: WAITER
D: Don't tell me it's you, Hildy!
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK and discloses our three at a restaurant table. Nothing swanky -- a place like Jack Blake's in New York, say.
C: HILDY
D: Nobody else.
E: beaming at waiter
N: She extends her hand. The waiter takes it; they shake.
C: HILDY
D: How's everything, Gus?
C: GUS
D: I can't complain.
C: BURNS
D: Well, I can. I'm hungry. Roast beef sandwich -- rare. And some coffee.
E: studying menu
C: GUS
D: Shall I put a little rum in the coffee? It's a nasty day.
C: BURNS
D: Good idea. How about you, Hildy?
C: HILDY
D: Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
E: discarding menu
C: GUS
D: Little rum in yours, too?
C: HILDY
D: I guess so.
N: Bruce looks at her. She hurriedly changes her mind.
C: HILDY
D: No -- just coffee, Gus.
C: GUS
D: Just coffee. And you, sir?
E: crestfallen to Bruce
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, I'll take the same, I guess. And a glass of milk.
E: putting menu down
C: GUS
D: Milk?
E: incredulous
C: BRUCE
D: Yes.
E: thinks he hasn't heard
C: GUS
D: Milk.
E: shaking his head as he writes it down
C: BURNS
D: And don't put any rum in it, Gus.
N: CLOSEUP - GUS Gus gives him a look and goes. ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRIO AT TABLE Burns surveys the others quizzically.
C: BURNS
D: Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
E: a sigh
C: BRUCE
D: Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
C: BURNS
D: Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
E: it's the Puritan in him
N: He whistles.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, it isn't like that.
E: rising to the bait
C: HILDY
D: It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
E: reassuring Mrs. Grundy
C: BURNS
D: Mother? But your mother --
C: BRUCE
D: No. My mother.
C: BURNS
D: Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
E: he gets it and underlines it
C: HILDY
D: Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still wanting to protect me?
E: to Bruce
N: She gives Burns that too-sweet look.
C: BURNS
D: I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
E: apparently taking this at face value
N: TWO SHOT - FEATURING BRUCE AND HILDY
C: BRUCE
D: I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
E: a little cookily
N: He pats Hildy's arm -- she smiles at him. THREE SHOT - HILDY, BRUCE AND BURNS
C: BURNS
D: Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
C: HILDY
D: I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
C: BURNS
D: Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
C: BRUCE
D: Well, I'll try to give her one.
C: BURNS
D: I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
C: BRUCE
D: Just for the first year.
C: BURNS
D: That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
E: sighing
N: That "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a kick under the table from Hildy.
C: BRUCE
D: Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
C: BURNS
D: Yes, I know... Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
E: he chuckles
N: His laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again. Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene.
C: GUS
D: Well, here we are.
N: He begins serving them.
C: BURNS
D: How's business, Bruce?
E: trying to pick up again after a second
C: BRUCE
D: Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
C: BURNS
D: I don't blame them.
N: Gus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns, lets out a startled "ouch".
C: HILDY
D: Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
C: GUS
D: That's all right.
E: a pained expression belies his words
C: BURNS
D: I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
C: BRUCE
D: Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
C: BURNS
D: I see what you mean.
N: They fall to. CLOSE SHOT - HILDY She sips her coffee and acts surprised.
C: HILDY
D: Gus, this --
N: CLOSEUP - GUS
C: GUS
D: Good coffee, isn't it?
E: winking
N: CLOSEUP - HILDY She smiles and winks back, and takes another sip. GROUP SHOT AT TABLE Gus starts to go.
C: BRUCE
D: You've forgotten my milk.
C: GUS
D: Oh. The milk. Yes.
N: He leaves scene, shaking his head. Burns sips his coffee. He likes it. He lifts his cup to Hildy.
C: BURNS
D: Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
C: HILDY
D: Thank you.
E: lifts cup
C: BRUCE
D: He hasn't brought my milk yet.
E: looking for something to respond with -- apologetically
N: A bus boy comes into scene and stops before Burns.
C: BUS BOY
D: They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns.
C: BURNS
D: They would!
N: Boy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of coffee, which he then takes off with him. TWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY
C: BRUCE
D: You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
E: looking after him
C: HILDY
D: You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
E: looking at him maternally
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
C: HILDY
D: He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
C: BRUCE
D: If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
E: shaking his head
C: HILDY
D: That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
S: INT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT
N: Burns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and then.
C: BURNS
D: Get this -- get Sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks' vacation -- and right away... All right, Duffy, keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't know it yet. But she'll be there. I promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie to stick around.
N: He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk. He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he comes out of the booth.
S: INT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE
N: Gus is entering the scene.
C: GUS
D: Your milk, sir.
N: He serves Bruce.
C: GUS
D: And I brought you another cup of coffee, Hildy.
N: Gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns' chair.
C: HILDY
D: Thanks, Gus.
N: She takes a sip and almost chokes.
C: BRUCE
D: Too hot?
C: HILDY
D: No. It's strong. But I like it that way.
E: gasping for breath quickly
N: Gus goes, smiling.
C: BRUCE
D: Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
E: looking off
C: HILDY
D: He certainly -- hic -- does!
E: beaming
N: Burns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before jumping off a roof, and sits down.
C: BRUCE
D: Anything the matter?
C: BURNS
D: Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
C: HILDY
D: What now?
C: BURNS
D: His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him. I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
E: he sips his coffee
C: HILDY
D: You said it.
E: sipping hers
C: BURNS
D: So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
C: BRUCE
D: Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
C: BURNS
D: It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
C: HILDY
D: If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
C: BURNS
D: Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
C: HILDY
D: The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
E: for Bruce's benefit
C: BURNS
D: Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
C: BRUCE
D: Are you sure Williams is not all there?
C: BURNS
D: All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
C: BRUCE
D: But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
N: CLOSEUP - BURNS
C: BURNS
D: How?
E: there's a sly expression on his face
C: HILDY'S VOICE
D: You could run an interview that would prove it. Remember the interview I wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved his life.
C: BURNS
D: Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You could save that poor devil's life. You could -- but -- -- you're going away. I forgot.
E: slapping hands together the enthusiasm dies away
N: THREE SHOT
C: BRUCE
D: How long would the interview take?
C: BURNS
D: Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
C: BRUCE
D: We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
C: HILDY
D: No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
C: BURNS
D: I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
C: HILDY
D: Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
C: BURNS
D: You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
E: to Bruce
N: Bruce gulps.
C: BURNS
D: How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
C: HILDY
D: What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
E: breaking into applause
C: BURNS
D: What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
C: HILDY
D: Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
C: BURNS
D: What do you mean?
C: HILDY
D: I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
C: BURNS
D: All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
E: laughs, throws up his hands
C: HILDY
D: We're not interested.
C: BURNS
D: Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
E: to Bruce
C: BRUCE
D: I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
C: HILDY
D: Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
C: BRUCE
D: Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
C: HILDY
D: And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
C: BRUCE
D: But --
C: HILDY
D: According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
C: BRUCE
D: I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
C: BURNS
D: Now you're talking!
C: HILDY
D: You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train. And no tricks, Walter!
E: turning on Burns back to Burns
C: BURNS
D: What tricks would I pull?
C: HILDY
D: Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
C: BRUCE
D: About twenty-five hundred dollars.
C: HILDY
D: Better make that a certified check, Walter.
C: BURNS
D: What do you think I am -- a crook?
E: indignantly
C: HILDY
D: Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
C: BURNS
D: All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
C: HILDY
D: No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
E: rising
C: BRUCE
D: All right, dear.
C: HILDY
D: Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
C: BRUCE
D: The five hundred? Sure.
E: feeling his pocket
C: HILDY
D: On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
C: BRUCE
D: But --
C: HILDY
D: Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
C: BRUCE
D: But I don't gamble, Hilda!
C: HILDY
D: I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
C: BRUCE
D: All right. One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
E: reluctantly he pulls out his wallet
C: HILDY
D: I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
N: She kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek.
C: HILDY
D: So long, husbands.
N: She goes. TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY leaving. She weaves just a bit. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN They look after her.
C: BRUCE
D: I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
E: smiling a little
C: BURNS
D: You haven't seen anything yet.
N: Bruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other.
T: FADE OUT:
S: FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG - DAY CLOSE
N: SHOT AT TELEPHONE It is ringing. A hand comes in to take the phone. CAMERA DRAWS BACK A LITTLE to show Endicott taking the phone. He has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other hand.
C: ENDICOTT
D: Criminal Courts Press Room... This is Endicott... No, nothing new on the Williams case yet boss. Well, you bet I'm here plugging away every minute. Up a dime.
E: into phone hangs up and studies his cards
N: CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak. Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and McCue.
C: MURPHY
D: By me.
E: dropping his cards
C: WILSON
D: Droparoo.
E: also dropping
N: Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards.
C: MCCUE
D: I'll call.
E: reluctantly
C: ENDICOTT
D: Three sixes. Is that any good?
C: HILDY'S VOICE
D: It sure looks good from here.
N: The boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice. CLOSE SHOT HILDY JOHNSON framed in the doorway. She is carrying a bag and has changed her costume to a tailored travelling suit. She grins and comes into the room. MED. SHOT REPORTERS They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene. There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for silence.
C: HILDY
D: One at a time, boys.
N: She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All through the above action she is talking rapidly.
C: HILDY
D: No, I'm not back for good. I'm just covering the Earl Williams story for Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up with Walter Burns -- far from it! As a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight for Albany and I'll be married tomorrow morning. The lucky man is Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business -- and when I say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other questions?
N: Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put on the new stockings.
C: ENDICOTT
D: Well, that about covers everything.
E: grinning
C: HILDY
D: Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
C: MURPHY
D: If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
C: MCCUE
D: It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job. Take it away, Fred Wilson!
E: waving his hand toward Wilson
C: WILSON
D: Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding. Come in, Dave Schwartz.
E: gesturing toward Schwartz
C: SCHWARTZ
D: His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
C: HILDY
D: Thanks, boys. That's all I want to know.
N: Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts the stockings in a drawer.
C: ENDICOTT
D: Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
C: HILDY
D: I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
N: Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down.
C: HILDY
D: All right, boys, now that everything is settled, deal me in.
N: Hildy glances toward clock on wall. The hands show 2:45 PM. INSERT: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM. CLOSE SHOT HILDY She picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial, picking up cards dealt her with one hand.

C: BURNS
D: Going all right, eh?
E: into phone
C: DOCTOR
D: Fine.
E: nodding
N: Doctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up.
C: BURNS
D: Doctor, will you please keep quiet a minute? How do you expect me to get any work done?
E: putting hand over mouthpiece of phone
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bruce, who has some papers in front of him at the desk. Bruce grins.
C: DOCTOR
D: How do you expect me to get anywhere if you're going to keep on that phone? If you'll just give me two minutes more --
C: BURNS
D: Well, they haven't finished with me yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of condition. They found two new dimples.
E: into phone

C: BENSINGER
D: Say, who put these stockings in my desk?
E: he turns to the group
N: McCUE's VOICE I don't know, but I think they got rats in the building.
C: BENSINGER
D: This is Bensinger. I just saw the Sheriff. He won't move the hanging up a minute... All right, I'll talk to him again, but it's no use. The execution is set for seven in the morning. Get me a rewrite man.
E: makes a gesture of disgust and picks up telephone
N: CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT dealing the cards.
C: ENDICOTT
D: Why can't they hang that guy at a reasonable hour, so we can get some sleep?
N: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

N: MED. SHOT AT TABLE - FEATURING MURPHY Murphy reaches for the phone. Without dropping his cards, he jiggles the hook.
C: MURPHY

E: into phone
C: ENDICOTT
D: This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
C: MURPHY
D: Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
C: ENDICOTT
D: Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!

E: into phone
N: CLOSE SHOT MURPHY
C: MURPHY
D: And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
E: into phone
N: MED. SHOT AT TABLE FEATURING HILDY
C: ENDICOTT
D: Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
C: MURPHY
D: What have you got, Hildy?
C: HILDY
D: Kings and sixes.
C: MURPHY
D: That's good.
E: throwing down
C: HILDY
D: 'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
E: sweeping coins in
C: WILSON
D: That's why I keep losing. My grandma was a modest woman -- nobody ever saw her knees, not even my grandpop.
S: INT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE MED. SHOT
N: The doctor has gone. Burns is adjusting his shirt. Bruce is sitting at the desk.
C: BRUCE
D: I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
N: TWO SHOT
C: BURNS
D: Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
C: BRUCE
D: I feel I ought to take care of her.
C: BURNS
D: Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
C: BRUCE
D: Well, I'm independent, too.
C: BURNS
D: Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
C: BRUCE
D: Well, of course, if you put it that way.
C: BURNS
D: And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
E: everything he has on the ball
C: BRUCE
D: I'm beginning to realize that.
C: BURNS
D: And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
C: BRUCE
D: Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
E: a lump in his throat
C: BURNS
D: No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
N: He turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see how that goes over. It goes over big -- Bruce hurriedly wipes a tear away. MED. SHOT as Duffy comes into the room. He advances toward the desk.
C: DUFFY
D: Here's that certified check, Walter. I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
E: placing check on desk sotto voce
C: BURNS
D: Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five. Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
E: also sotto voce louder picking up check he rises
N: He walks over to Bruce.
C: BURNS
D: Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
C: BRUCE
D: Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
E: also rising
N: CLOSEUP DUFFY He reacts to this sweetly solemn thought. BURNS AND BRUCE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as Burns walks Bruce toward door, his arm around him.
C: BRUCE
D: Well, she'll know some day.
C: BURNS
D: That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
N: He releases Bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it to him.
C: BURNS
D: Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
C: BRUCE
D: Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
N: They are at the door. Burns opens the door for Bruce. SHOT FEATURING LOUIS Louis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a newspaper. He is all alert, however. Bruce and Burns come into the scene talking.
C: BURNS
D: Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
C: BRUCE
D: Thanks a lot.
E: embarrassed
N: They pass Louis. He looks up. BRUCE AND BURNS Bruce, still embarrassed, looks down. Burns turns and signals to Louis. CLOSE SHOT LOUIS watching. CLOSE SHOT BURNS Burns points to Bruce's back. CLOSE SHOT LOUIS Louis nods. BRUCE AND BURNS
C: BURNS
D: Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, sure. Well, thanks for everything.
E: he extends his hand
C: BURNS
D: Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
C: BRUCE
D: So long.
N: He turns and goes. Burns watches him. REVERSE ANGLE Bruce is going out, his back toward Camera. Burns watches. Louis comes between Burns and Bruce and follows Bruce out as we see Bruce going toward outer door. CLOSEUP BURNS He rubs his hands in glee as he starts back for his office.
S: INT. PRESS ROOM SHOT FEATURING HILDY
N: She is raking in a pot.
C: HILDY
D: I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
C: MCCUE
D: Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
E: throwing cards down
C: HILDY
D: Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
N: There is a whirr and crash from the gallows. They start. BENSINGER AT WINDOW
C: BENSINGER
D: I wish they'd stop that practicing.
N: The others drift into the scene and look out of the window.
S: INT. COURTYARD THE GALLOWS
N: The trap is sprung by two or three earnest men.
S: INT. PRESS ROOM GROUP AT WINDOW

C: SCHWARTZ
D: What's the matter? Getting yellow?
N: MED. SHOT A phone rings. McCue answers it.

S: INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE SHOT BRUCE
C: BRUCE

S: INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE
N: McCue is hovering near.
C: MCCUE
D: Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
C: HILDY
D: But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see -- -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
E: in phone she is thinking rapidly
C: MCCUE
D: Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
C: HILDY
D: I made it up just now, and who's asking you? I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
E: to McCue into phone
S: INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE SHOT BRUCE
C: BRUCE
D: All right. Wait a minute.
N: He takes check out of wallet, folds it into lining of hat.
C: BRUCE
D: All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
S: INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE
C: HILDY
D: Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
N: She blows a kiss into the phone. Immediately we hear kiss sounds all over. She looks up and glares. Then back to phone:
C: HILDY
D: Now, darling, you go back to the hotel and pack and you and Mother pick me up here about half-past five. Goodbye, dear.
S: INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE SHOT BRUCE
N: He blows a kiss into the phone and hangs up.
S: EXT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT LOUIS
N: Studying a paper, reads it for a moment. Bruce comes out of restaurant and starts out. After a second, Louis follows him.
S: INT. ENTRANCE TO A CELL BLOCK OF COUNTY JAIL MED. SHOT
N: Warden Cooley sits at a desk near the grilled doorway that leads to the cells. He is studying a Racing Form. Hildy's hand reaches into the shot and flicks the newspaper. He looks up. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hildy.
C: COOLEY
D: Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
C: HILDY
D: I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
C: COOLEY
D: No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
N: Hildy reaches down out of camera range -- comes up with bill.
C: HILDY
D: Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
C: COOLEY
D: I think it is.
E: looks at bill eagerly
C: HILDY
D: I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
E: handing it over
N: Cooley pockets the twenty and reaches for his key ring.
S: EXT. STREET SCENE
N: There is a milling mob around a center of activity that the Camera can't find. SHOT OF COP as he sees this and strolls determinedly toward it. THE CROWD The cop comes in and breaks ranks. He pushes his way toward center and looks down. CLOSE SHOT BRUCE lying down, held by Louis. MED. SHOT
C: COP
D: What's going on?
C: LOUIS
D: This guy stole my watch.
C: COP
D: Have you got his watch?
E: lugging them both to feet

C: BRUCE
D: I haven't got --
C: COP

N: The cop reaches into Bruce's back pocket. Watch comes out.
C: COP
D: Is this yours?
E: to Louis
C: LOUIS
D: Yeah! That's it!
C: COP
D: What about it?
C: BRUCE
D: I never saw it before.
N: Cop grabs Bruce. Louis grabs his other arm.
C: COP
D: Come on!
N: He whistles.
C: COP
D: Beat it!
E: to mob
N: CLOSE SHOT THREE as they go through crowd. The look on poor Bruce's face, muddy anyhow, is something. Suddenly, Bruce cries:
C: BRUCE
D: My hat!
C: COP
D: Get his hat, somebody.
N: CLOSEUP BRUCE'S HAT lying top up, in a puddle. Hand reaches in and picks it up. CLOSE SHOT THREE as hat is passed to cop, who jams it down on Bruce's head. Another takem from Bruce.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: at the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals himself.
C: WILLIAMS
D: I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
C: HILDY
D: You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
E: puzzled and worried
C: WILLIAMS
D: Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
C: HILDY
D: What are your beliefs, Earl?
C: WILLIAMS
D: They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
C: HILDY
D: How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
C: WILLIAMS
D: I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
C: HILDY
D: "Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
E: writing
C: WILLIAMS
D: It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
N: CLOSEUP HILDY
C: HILDY
D: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
E: thoughtfully
C: WILLIAM'S VOICE
D: Just use things for what they were meant, that's all.
C: HILDY
D: Sure. What's the purpose of a gun, Earl?
E: she studies him a moment
N: CLOSEUP WILLIAMS
C: WILLIAMS
D: A gun? Why -- to shoot, of course.
E: he thinks -- then a revealing smile breaks out
N: MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT
C: HILDY
D: Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
C: WILLIAMS
D: Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
C: HILDY
D: Very simple, Earl.
E: writing
C: WILLIAMS
D: There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
C: HILDY
D: No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
E: she indicates the flowers
C: WILLIAMS
D: Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
E: reverently
C: HILDY
D: Isn't that her picture?
E: pointing to picture pinned on wall
C: WILLIAMS
D: Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
E: turning toward it
N: INSERT: PICTURE OF MOLLIE
C: HILDY'S VOICE
D: If you should be pardoned, are you figuring on marrying Mollie?
C: EARL'S VOICE
D: Oh, no, she's much too good for me.
C: HARTMAN'S VOICE
D: How'd you get in here?
N: MEDIUM SHOT Sheriff Hartman has come into the scene. Hildy turns toward him.
C: HILDY
D: Same way you did. Through that gate.
E: pointing
C: HARTMAN
D: I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
C: HILDY
D: All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
C: HARTMAN
D: Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
C: HILDY
D: Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
C: HARTMAN
D: Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
E: beaming turning toward Williams
C: WILLIAMS
D: Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
C: HARTMAN
D: That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
C: WILLIAMS
D: I won't.
C: HARTMAN
D: Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
E: to Hildy
C: HILDY
D: No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
E: in a low voice so Williams won't overhear
C: HARTMAN
D: You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
E: just as loud as ever
C: HILDY
D: That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Don't forget about production for use.
C: HILDY
D: I won't, Earl.
E: she goes
S: INT. PRESS ROOM GROUP SHOT POKER GAME - NIGHT
N: The game is on. Bensinger, at his desk, is reading a book. The electric lights have been switched on.
C: MURPHY
D: Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
E: raking in a pot
C: ENDICOTT
D: Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
C: WILSON
D: Baldwin -- his name is.
C: SCHWARTZ
D: I give that marriage six months.
C: MCCUE
D: Why?
C: SCHWARTZ
D: Hildy won't be able to stay away from a paper any longer than that. Did you see her eyes light up when she came in here? Like an old fire horse.
C: MURPHY
D: She says she's gonna write fiction.
C: ENDICOTT
D: Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
C: SCHWARTZ
D: I'll give ten to five that marriage won't last six months. Hildy's a newspaper man. She's got headlines in her veins -- the way we all have or we'd be out of these lousy jobs.
N: Mollie Malloy appears in doorway. She moves slowly into the room.
C: MCCUE
D: Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
C: MURPHY
D: Hello, Mollie.
C: WILSON
D: How's tricks, Mollie?
N: CLOSE SHOT MOLLIE
C: MOLLIE
D: I've been lookin' for you tramps.
N: MED. GROUP SHOT
C: ENDICOTT
D: Kid, those were pretty roses you sent Earl. What do you want done with them tomorrow morning?
C: MOLLIE
D: A lot of wise guys, ain't you?
E: tensely
C: SCHWARTZ
D: You're breaking up the game, Mollie. What do you want?
E: uncomfortably
C: MOLLIE
D: I want to tell you what I think of you -- all of you.
N: Hildy appears in the doorway and comes into the room.
C: MURPHY
D: Keep your shirt on.
C: MOLLIE
D: If you was worth breaking my fingers on, I'd tear your face wide open.
E: to Murphy
N: Hildy goes to desk and begins typing away.
C: MURPHY
D: What are you sore about, sweetheart? Wasn't that a swell story we gave you?
C: MOLLIE
D: You crumbs have been making a fool out of me long enough!
C: BENSINGER
D: She oughtn't be allowed in here!
E: rising and coming over
N: CLOSEUP MOLLIE
C: MOLLIE
D: I never said I loved Earl Williams and was willing to marry him on the gallows! You made that up! And about my being his soul-mate and having a love-nest with him.
E: flaring
N: CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT looking up at her.
C: ENDICOTT
D: You've been sucking around that cuckoo ever since he's been in the death- house. Everybody knows you're his sweetheart.
N: CLOSEUP MOLLIE She blows up.
C: MOLLIE
D: That's a lie! I met Mr. Williams just once in my life when he was wandering around in the rain without his hat and coat on, like a sick dog, the day before the shooting. I went up to him like any human being would and I asked him what was the matter, and he told me about being fired after working at the same place for fourteen years, and I brought him up to my room because it was warm there.
N: CLOSE SHOT HILDY She is typing away, stops to look over at Mollie, then resolutely turns away, studies her stuff, and begins typing again.
C: MURPHY'S VOICE
D: Aw, put it on a phonograph!
N: MED. SHOT MOLLIE AND OTHERS
C: MOLLIE
D: Just because you want to fill your lying paper with a lot of dirty scandal, you got to crucify him and make a stooge out of me!
C: ENDICOTT
D: Got a match?
E: to Mollie
C: MOLLIE
D: I tell you he just sat there talking to me -- all night. And never once laid a hand on me. In the morning he went away, and I never saw him again till that day at the trial!
E: heedless
N: The boys laugh. CLOSEUP MOLLIE She lashes out at them.
C: MOLLIE
D: Go on, laugh! I'd like to know some curses bad enough for your greasy souls! Sure, I was his witness -- the only one he had. Yes -- me -- cheap little Mollie Malloy! I'm everything the District Attorney said I was. And still I was the only one with guts enough to stand up for him! I told the truth and the District Attorney knows it! That's why you're persecutin' me! Because Earl Williams treated me decent and not like an animal -- and I said so!
N: MEDIUM SHOT
C: MURPHY
D: Go into your dance! This is the Press Room. We're busy.
E: finally irritated
C: WILSON
D: Why don't you go and see your boy- friend?
C: ENDICOTT
D: But you'll have to hurry up -- he left a call for seven A.M.
E: winks at the others
C: MOLLIE
D: It's a wonder a bolt of lightning don't come down and strike you all dead!
E: through her teeth
N: From o.s. comes sound of the gallows. Mollie gasps.
C: ENDICOTT
D: Don't get hysterical, kid.
E: suddenly uncomfortable
C: MOLLIE
D: Shame on you!
E: begins to sob
N: CLOSE SHOT MOLLIE -- TAKING IN MURPHY
C: MOLLIE
D: A poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm! Sitting there alone this minute with the Angel of Death beside him, and you cracking jokes!
E: hysterically
N: CLOSEUP HILDY typing away furiously, regardless of this. She ends a page. The sound of Mollie sobbing comes over the scene. Hildy inserts a fresh page.
C: MURPHY'S VOICE
D: If you don't shut up, we'll give you something to cry about!
N: Hildy looks o.s. and rises determinedly. MEDIUM SHOT - MOLLIE BACKING AWAY FROM MURPHY She is still sobbing. Hildy comes into scene and puts her arm around Mollie.
C: HILDY
D: Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
E: gently she leads Mollie toward door
C: MOLLIE
D: They're not human!
C: HILDY
D: They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
C: MOLLIE
D: It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
E: one look back as Hildy leads her out door
N: Hildy and Mollie exit. There is a pause. The boys look at each other uncomfortably. The phone rings. Wilson goes to answer.
C: MURPHY
D: You guys wanna play some more poker?
E: picking up cards
C: ENDICOTT
D: What's the use? I can't win a pot.
N: CLOSE SHOT WILSON AT PHONE
C: WILSON

E: to others
C: SCHWARTZ
D: What's he want?
C: WILSON
D: Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
N: Hildy comes back. Looks at them and stares contemptuously.
C: HILDY
D: Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
C: WILSON
D: Phone for you, Hildy.
C: HILDY
D: Who is it?
E: going toward it
C: WILSON
D: Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
C: HILDY
D: Give me that!
E: grabbing phone
N: CLOSEUP HILDY

E: into phone she listens unbelievingly a second
N: MED. SHOT as Hildy hangs up and darts out of room. The others watch in amazement.
C: MURPHY
D: Boy, did you see her go?
C: ENDICOTT
D: Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
C: WILSON
D: I told you Baldwin was in trouble.
C: MCCUE

C: SCHWARTZ
D: I still give that marriage six months.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER at phone.
C: BENSINGER
D: Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff's offico, will you... Hello, Sheriff Hartman?... This is Bensinger. How about that favor? You know what: once and for all, will you hang this guy at five A.M. instead of seven? It won't hurt you and we can make the City Edition.
S: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE CLOSE SHOT SHERIFF HARTMAN
N: at phone.
C: HARTMAN
D: Once and for all, I'm not going to hang anybody except at the legal hour... What? Don't threaten me, Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up! And, operator, I told you not to disturb me! I don't care who calls -- I don't want to be disturbed again till I tell you! How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer? Want me to hang williams at their convenience!
E: indignantly he hangs up; an afterthought -- he calls up operator he hangs up -- turns to somebody o.s. and speaks
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A MED. GROUP SHOT, showing Williams, Sheriff Hartman and Dr. Egelhoffer. They are the only occupants of room. Williams is seated facing a large standing searchlight.
C: EGELHOFFER
D: The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
C: HARTMAN
D: You said it!
C: EGELHOFFER
D: They're always after me for interviews.
C: HARTMAN
D: Me, too.
C: EGELHOFFER
D: Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
E: fencing
C: HARTMAN
D: Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
E: not liking it
C: EGELHOFFER
D: We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
E: he'll bargain
C: HARTMAN
D: A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
E: he buys
C: EGELHOFFER
D: Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
C: HARTMAN
D: It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
C: EGELHOFFER
D: Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Are you gentlemen all through with me?
E: just a spectator up to now
C: EGELHOFFER
D: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
N: The Sheriff puts out the lights and the Doctor switches on the searchlight, which shines in Williams' face.
C: EGELHOFFER
D: You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
C: WILLIAMS
D: The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
C: EGELHOFFER
D: I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
N: CLOSEUP WILLIAMS
C: WILLIAMS
D: In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. POLICE CELL CLOSEUP BRUCE

N: She whirls on lieutenant.
C: HILDY
D: Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
E: to lieutenant
C: LIEUTENANT
D: But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
E: conciliatingly
C: HILDY
D: And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Now, Hildy --
C: HILDY
D: Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
C: LIEUTENANT
D: I can't.
C: HILDY
D: All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
C: HILDY
D: You can let him out on bail, can't you?
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Five hundred dollars.
C: HILDY
D: You'll take fifty and like it!
C: LIEUTENANT

S: INT. TAXI (PROCESS SHOT)
N: Hildy is combing Bruce's hair. He begins to look presentable. He fumbles in his breast pocket.
C: HILDY
D: What's the matter?
C: BRUCE
D: I lost my wallet.
C: HILDY
D: The check, Bruce!
E: stops
N: Bruce picks up his hat and gets check out of lining.
C: BRUCE
D: That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
C: HILDY
D: Yes, wasn't it?
E: taking check and putting it away
C: BRUCE
D: I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
C: HILDY
D: I'm sure you haven't any.
E: looking at him fondly
C: BRUCE
D: For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
C: HILDY
D: Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
C: HILDY
D: Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
C: BRUCE

C: HILDY
D: The Criminal Courts Building.
E: to driver
N: The driver nods.
C: HILDY

E: to Bruce
C: BRUCE
D: But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
C: HILDY

S: INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT AT HILDY'S DESK
N: Schwartz is reading Hildy's interview to the other boys, who are grouped around. Bensinger is at his desk, a book open, but listening.
C: SCHWARTZ
D: "But the State has a production for use plan, too. It has a gallows and at seven A.M., unless a miracle occurs, that gallows will be used to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his body. And out of Molly Malloy's life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew --" That's as far as Hildy got. But, I ask you, can that girl write an interview?
E: reading he stops
C: BENSINGER
D: I don't think it's very ethical reading other people's stuff.
C: ENDICOTT
D: Don't give us that ethics stuff. You'll be the only one who'll swipe any of it.
C: SCHWARTZ
D: I still say anybody that writes like that ain't going to give it up permanently to sew sox for a guy in the insurance business. Now I give that marriage three months and I'm laying three to one. Any takers?
C: HILDY'S VOICE
D: I'll take that bet.
N: They turn. Hildy comes into the scene.
C: HILDY
D: It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies. Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
E: going to her phone into phone; her voice assumes a silken quality
N: CLOSE SHOT SCHWARTZ
C: SCHWARTZ
D: Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
E: embarrassed
N: MED. SHOT FEATURING HILDY
C: HILDY
D: This is Hildy Johnson... Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats. Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
E: into phone to Schwartz into phone
N: The others are listening, suspecting a scoop.
C: HILDY
D: Better get a pencil out and write it down. All ready? Get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story... Huh? That certified check of yours is leaving with me in twenty minutes. And if I ever see you again, it's going to be just too bad... Eh?... Oh, you don't know what I'm angry about, do you? If you come over I'll be very glad to tell you the story of Louie's watch. I dare you to come over, you -- you -- skunk in sheep's clothing! And bring that bodyguard of yours, too -- you'll need him.
E: then with a sudden change of pace
N: QUICK CUTS OF REACTION FROM OTHERS CLOSEUP HILDY
C: HILDY
D: ...And I just want you to listen to one more thing.
N: She gets her story out of typewriter, applies it to transmitter and tears it up.
C: HILDY
D: Hear that? That's the interview I wrote... Yes, I know we made a bargain. I just said I'd write it -- I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up. Yes, it's all in little pieces now, Walter, and I hope to do the same for you some time!
N: She hangs up. MED. SHOT FEATURING HILDY She reaches under her desk, pulls up bag, talking all the time. The others are too startled to do anything but listen.
C: HILDY
D: And that's my farewell to the newspaper game. I'm going to live a normal life and have a home.
N: She reaches into the drawer of desk and gets some stuff which she puts into bag.
C: HILDY
D: I'm going to be a woman, not a newsgetting machine. I'm going to have babies and nurse them and love them and give 'em cod liver oil and worry about their new teeth -- and the minute I catch one of them even looking at a newspaper, I'm going to brain him! Where's my hat?
N: Someone points to her hat. She rises and goes toward it. Her bag is still open. Her phone rings. Schwartz answers it.
C: SCHWARTZ
D: Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
E: subdued tones
C: HILDY
D: I'll take it. What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
E: stopping midway to her hat she comes over to phone
N: She pulls the phone out of the wall, walks toward window and tosses it out of the window. She waits for the crash, turns back and says:
C: HILDY
D: Now where was that hat? Oh, yes.

C: EGELHOFFER
D: Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?

C: WILLIAMS
D: Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
E: hesitantly
C: EGELHOFFER
D: Point the gun at me!
E: insistently
N: Williams does so.
C: EGELHOFFER
D: Then what did you do?
N: Williams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger. Hartman promptly dives under the desk as Egelhoffer topples over.
C: WILLIAMS

D: I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
C: HARTMAN
D: Fred!
E: David to Jonathan
C: MAYOR
D: Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
C: HARTMAN
D: Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
C: MAYOR
D: I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
C: HARTMAN
D: Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
C: MAYOR
D: If there was any way out...
E: wavering and desperate
N: As a phone rings:
C: HARTMAN
D: There is a way out. I've got Williams surrounded, haven't I? What more do you want? Hello... Yes... Hello! Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing! This is a man-hunt -- not a banquet!... The twelve dollars includes everything!!
E: into phone wildly
N: He hangs up.
C: HARTMAN
D: That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
C: MAYOR
D: We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
E: hotly
N: Sheriff winces.
C: MAYOR
D: Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
C: HARTMAN
D: Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
C: MAYOR
D: I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
C: HARTMAN
D: But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
N: A knock on the door.
C: MAYOR
D: What do you mean he can't get away?! He got away, didn't he?
N: Knocking louder.
C: MAYOR
D: Who's out there?
C: VOICE OUTSIDE
D: Is Sheriff Hartman in there?
E: PINKUS
N: Sheriff starts for door.
C: HARTMAN
D: Ah! For me!
E: relieved
N: MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR Sheriff opens the door. A small, very colorless and ineffectual man named Pinkus is there.
C: HARTMAN
D: I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
E: as he opens door, disclosing Pinkus
C: PINKUS
D: You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
E: coming in
C: MAYOR
D: What do you want?
E: annoyed
C: PINKUS
D: I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
E: taking a document from his pocket and proffering it to Sheriff
C: MAYOR
D: What's from the Governor?
C: PINKUS
D: The reprieve for Earl Williams.
C: HARTMAN
D: For who?
E: stunned
C: PINKUS
D: Earl Williams. The reprieve.
E: amiably
C: MAYOR
D: W-wait a minute.
N: Getting his bearings.
C: HARTMAN
D: The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
E: bursting forth
C: MAYOR
D: And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you. Who else knows about this?
E: to Pinkus
N: The Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read the thing.
C: PINKUS
D: They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
C: MAYOR
D: Get the Governor on the phone!
E: to Sheriff
C: PINKUS
D: You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
E: helpfully
C: MAYOR
D: Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
C: HARTMAN
D: Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
E: thrusting the document at the Mayor shaking a finger in Pinkus' face
C: PINKUS
D: Yeah. But I --
C: MAYOR
D: Pure politics!
E: interrupting
C: HARTMAN
D: An attempt to ruin us!
N: The phone rings. Hartman starts for it.
C: MAYOR
D: Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
E: reading
C: HARTMAN
D: We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
C: MAYOR
D: Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
C: HARTMAN
D: Ah, Fred -- Hello... this is Hartman --
E: into phone
C: MAYOR
D: And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
E: apoplectic
C: HARTMAN
D: Sssh. Wait, Fred. What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
E: from the phone excitedly, into phone
C: MAYOR
D: What is it?
C: HARTMAN
D: They got him! Wait a minute -- hold the wire. They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
E: back to phone to the Mayor
C: MAYOR
D: Tell 'em to hold the wire.
C: HARTMAN
D: I did. Hold the wire.
E: into phone
C: MAYOR
D: Cover up that transmitter!
N: Sheriff does so. Mayor faces Cooney.
C: MAYOR
D: Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
C: PINKUS
D: Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
E: blinking
C: MAYOR
D: How much do you make a week?
C: PINKUS
D: Huh?
C: MAYOR
D: How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
E: impatiently
C: PINKUS
D: Forty dollars.
E: reluctantly
C: HARTMAN
D: No -- don't out me off.
E: into phone
C: MAYOR
D: How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
C: PINKUS
D: Who? Me?
C: MAYOR
D: Who do you think!
E: exasperated
N: Pinkus is a little startled; the Mayor hastens to adopt a milder manner.
C: MAYOR
D: Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
C: PINKUS
D: The what?
C: MAYOR
D: The City Sealer's office!
C: PINKUS
D: You mean here in the city?
C: MAYOR
D: Yes, yes!
E: foaming
C: HARTMAN
D: Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
E: at phone
C: PINKUS
D: No, I couldn't do that.
E: a very deliberate intellect
C: MAYOR
D: Why not?
C: PINKUS
D: I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
C: MAYOR
D: But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
E: desperate
C: PINKUS
D: No, I don't think so.
E: with vast thought
C: MAYOR
D: For heaven's sake, why not?
C: PINKUS
D: I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
C: MAYOR
D: No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
C: PINKUS
D: Yeah?
E: lured
C: HARTMAN
D: Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
E: into phone
C: MAYOR
D: Now what do you say?
C: PINKUS
D: This puts me in a peculiar hole.
C: MAYOR
D: No, it doesn't. Now, remember: you never delivered this. You got caught in the traffic, or something. Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
E: hands him the reprieve rushing him to the door opening door
C: PINKUS
D: But how do I know...?
C: MAYOR
D: Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
C: PINKUS
D: Pinkus.
C: MAYOR
D: All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here! Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
E: taking out his wallet he hands him a card
N: He pushes money into Pinkus's hand and pushes him through the door. Pinkus goes.
C: HARTMAN
D: Will you wait, Olsen? I'll tell you in a minute!
E: into phone, desperately
N: The door opens again and Pinkus comes back in.
C: PINKUS
D: You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
C: MAYOR
D: I'll explain it tomorrow!
E: turning hastily toward Pinkus
C: PINKUS
D: Is it hard?
C: MAYOR
D: No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
C: HARTMAN
D: Just one second --
E: pleadingly, into phone
C: PINKUS
D: That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
C: MAYOR
D: We'll fix that, too.
E: pushing him out the door he closes the door after him
C: HARTMAN
D: Just -- one -- second!
E: into phone -- one more plea
N: He turns to the Mayor with a gesture of appeal. The Mayor closes the door and turns to Hartman.
C: MAYOR
D: All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
E: huskily
C: HARTMAN
D: What?
C: MAYOR
D: Shoot to kill, I said.
C: HARTMAN
D: I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
C: MAYOR
D: Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
C: HARTMAN
D: Hello, Olsen... Listen... Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there. Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
E: into phone his voice is weak hangs up
C: MAYOR
D: Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
C: HARTMAN
D: If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
E: mopping his brow
S: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT
N: Louie comes from the direction of the stairs and crosses toward door to Press Room. He pauses a moment, puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out some bills, counts them and opens the door.
S: INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT
N: Hildy is still pacing, pounding her hands together and glancing every so often at the clock on the wall. Suddenly she crosses to her phone, picks up transmitter --
C: HILDY
D: Will you try --
E: into phone
C: LOUIE'S VOICE
D: Hildy.
C: HILDY
D: Louie!
E: wheeling towards door
N: She drops the phone and hurries towards him.
C: HILDY
D: Have you got my dough?
C: LOUIS
D: Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
C: HILDY
D: Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
C: LOUIS
D: All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
C: HILDY
D: Come on with that money!
C: LOUIS
D: First you got to sign a receipt.
E: he pulls out a receipt
C: HILDY
D: Where's the money?
C: LOUIS
D: Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here. One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
E: he picks out money and counts
C: HILDY
D: Here!
E: grabs money and signs
C: LOUIS
D: Thanks. So long, Hildy!
C: HILDY
D: So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
E: grabbing him
C: LOUIS
D: Huh?
C: HILDY
D: None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
C: LOUIS
D: Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
N: He takes Bruce's wallet out.
C: HILDY
D: You know it is!
E: grabbing it
C: LOUIS
D: I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
C: HILDY
D: No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
C: LOUIS
D: What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
E: surprised
N: He suddenly realizes what he's said and sprints for the door. Hildy chucks something at him. It just misses as he ducks out of the door. MED. SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE Hildy casts a savage look after the departed Louie, takes another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to dial.
C: HILDY
D: 27th Precinct Station House?
E: into phone
N: Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window. She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Drop that phone --
E: pointing gun at her
N: Hildy drops the phone back on the hook.
C: WILLIAMS
D: You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
E: supporting himself by holding on to edge of desk
C: HILDY
D: Put down that gun, Earl.
E: bracing herself
N: He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her.
C: HILDY
D: You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
C: WILLIAMS
D: Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
N: Hildy starts walking toward him, slowly.
C: HILDY
D: Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
C: WILLIAMS
D: Don't move!
N: Hildy stops.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
C: HILDY
D: Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
C: WILLIAMS
D: No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
N: Hildy sneaks another step forward.
C: HILDY
D: Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
C: WILLIAMS
D: What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
C: HILDY
D: I don't blame you, Earl. If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
E: another step forward
C: WILLIAMS
D: Keep away!
E: suddenly
N: He points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a faint "click!"
C: WILLIAMS
D: I guess I used all the shells.
E: weakly
N: CLOSE TWO SHOT He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily.
C: HILDY
D: Earl, you must never do that again.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
C: HILDY
D: Well, maybe you think I could!
E: more her old self now
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she retrieves the gun and jams it in her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades.
C: EARL'S VOICE
D: I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin' the fella that when he handed me the gun.
N: Hildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light from the areaway.
C: HILDY
D: Don't talk too loud.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
E: babbling on as she moves about
C: HILDY
D: Sure I do, Earl.
N: Hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him.
C: WILLIAMS
D: I wish they'd take me back and hang me. I done my best.
N: He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone.
C: HILDY
D: Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick!
E: into phone
N: Another phone there rings. Hildy answers it, propping the receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder. CLOSEUP HILDY AT PHONE
C: HILDY
D: Hello -- hel -- Oh, hello, Bruce... Oh, Bruce, please -- I know I said I'd be down in fifteen minutes, but something terrific's happened! Hang on, Bruce -- Walter?... Hildy. Come over here -- right away!... Wait! Bruce, just a second, Bruce -- I'll explain everything. Walter! Get this: I've got Earl Williams... Yes! Here in the Press Room... Honest! On the level. Hurry -- I need you.
E: into second phone into first phone into second phone into first phone
N: She hangs up and turns into second phone.
C: HILDY
D: Bruce, this is the biggest thing that ever happened... I just captured Earl Williams -- you know -- the murderer --
E: lowers voice
N: There is a knocking on the door, but she doesn't hear it.
C: HILDY
D: Bruce, I'll be down -- Well, Bruce, the minute I turn him over to the paper I'll be right down. Bruce, don't you -- Bruce, I can't now -- I can't, don't you realize?
N: There is a click from the phone. He has hung up. Hildy dejectedly hangs up the phone. There is the sound of knocking on the door. She springs up. MED. SHOT taking in door. Hildy glares apprehensively, then crosses to it.
C: HILDY
D: Who's there?
E: cautiously
C: MOLLIE'S VOICE
D: It's me, Mollie Malloy! Let me in.
N: Hildy carefully unlocks the door. Mollie bounds in like a wildcat and seizes her.
C: MOLLIE
D: Where are they gone? You know where they are?
C: HILDY
D: Wait a minute, Mollie.
N: She manages to relock the door, then turns, leaning against it, facing Mollie. CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE
C: MOLLIE
D: They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
C: HILDY
D: Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
C: MOLLIE
D: What do you mean?
N: There is a sound -- a groan -- as Williams starts to come to.
C: MOLLIE
D: What's that?
E: spinning around
C: HILDY
D: Quiet, Mollie!
C: MOLLIE
D: There's somethin' funny going on around here.
N: MED. SHOT Mollie crosses to wall and switches on the lights. She sees Williams, sobs and rushes over to him. CLOSEUP EARL AND MOLLIE Mollie gets down on her knees and begins ministering to Earl. He opens his eyes.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Hello, Mollie.
N: Mollie begins to sob. WIDER ANGLE SHOT Hildy comes over and says:
C: HILDY
D: Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
C: WILLIAMS
D: Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
E: putting out hand to stroke her hair
C: HILDY
D: How'd you get here, Earl?
C: WILLIAMS
D: Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
C: MOLLIE
D: Of course I believe you.
E: coming up
C: WILLIAMS
D: I forgot to thank you for those roses. They were beautiful.
C: MOLLIE
D: That's all right, Mr. Williams... You're a woman. You got to help us. You got to get him out of here, some place where I can take care of him.
E: to Hildy
C: HILDY
D: Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
C: WILLIAMS
D: Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
C: MOLLIE
D: No -- I'll never let 'em!
N: The door is tried outside.

E: turning from phone

C: MURPHY
D: Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
C: ENDICOTT
D: Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun. Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
E: turning on Mollie
C: MOLLIE

C: MCCUE
D: Come clean, Mollie.
E: crossing to Mollie
N: Wilson, Endicott and Murphy follow McCue toward Hildy.

C: HILDY
D: Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
C: MURPHY
D: Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.

C: HILDY
D: Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
C: BURNS

E: scornfully
C: HILDY
D: Oh, get off that trapeze! There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
E: indicating desk, off
C: BURNS
D: You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!

E: interrupting quickly closes the door
C: HILDY
D: Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
E: slightly bewildered
C: BURNS
D: Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
C: HILDY
D: I'd like to think.
E: the fire upon her
C: BURNS
D: Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
C: HILDY
D: I get it!
E: excited
C: BURNS
D: You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
C: HILDY
D: Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
C: BURNS
D: Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies! By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
E: slapping his fist against his open palm
C: HILDY
D: Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --

We've got something a whole lot bigger than that. Hildy Johnson's writing the lead and I'll phone it over to you as soon as she's finished. Oh, Duffy! Get hold of Butch O'Connor and tell him I want him to come up here with half a dozen other wrestlers -- right away! Tell him we'll run his picture on the sport page for two weeks straight. What?

E: holding the phone
C: MAYOR
D: A sight for sore eyes!
E: happily
C: HARTMAN
D: Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into. But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
E: rolling in catnip into phone; suddenly
C: MAYOR
D: Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
C: BURNS
D: Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
C: MAYOR
D: Your luck's not with you now!

E: to Mayor
C: HARTMAN
D: Give me the District Attorney's office. I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary. Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
E: into phone to Burns into phone
N: He hangs up. Burns makes a sudden lunge for the Morning Post phone and cries into it.
C: BURNS
D: Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
E: into phone
C: MAYOR
D: All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
C: BURNS
D: This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
C: MAYOR
D: The power of the press, huh!
E: enjoying himself
N: He laughs. Pinkus, the Governor's messenger, plentifully stewed, reels in the door. He approaches the Mayor and Sheriff who have their backs to him.
C: BURNS
D: Bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is... President!... Yes -- and Kings!
E: at the Mayor
C: PINKUS
D: Here's your reprieve.
E: woozy; handing Sheriff the reprieve over his shoulder
N: The Mayor and Sheriff spin around.
C: MAYOR
D: Get out of here!
E: in a panic
C: PINKUS
D: You can't bribe me!
C: BURNS
D: What's this?
C: HARTMAN
D: Get out of here, you!
C: PINKUS
D: I won't. Here's your reprieve.
C: HILDY
D: What?
C: PINKUS
D: I don't want to be City Sealer. I don't like seals anyhow. They smell.
C: MAYOR
D: Who is this man?
C: HARTMAN
D: Throw him out, Frank.
E: to an officer
C: HILDY
D: Who was bribing you?
E: seizing Pinkus with her free hand
N: Burns also seizes Pinkus who is being pulled out of shape.
C: PINKUS
D: They wouldn't take it.
C: MAYOR
D: You're insane!
C: BURNS
D: What did I tell you? An unseen power! What's your name?
E: triumphant to Pinkus
C: PINKUS
D: Silas F. Pinkus.
C: MAYOR
D: You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
C: HARTMAN
D: It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
C: HILDY
D: Wait a minute! Let go there!
E: to the officers
C: BURNS
D: Murder, uh?
E: to Sheriff and Mayor
C: HILDY
D: Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
C: HARTMAN
D: That's a lie!!
C: MAYOR
D: I never saw him before!
C: BURNS
D: When did you deliver this first?
E: to Pinkus
C: HILDY
D: Who did you talk to?
C: PINKUS
D: They started right in bribing me!
C: HILDY
D: Who's 'they'?
C: PINKUS
D: Them!
E: indicating the Mayor and Sheriff
C: MAYOR
D: That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
C: BURNS
D: Out of the mouths of babes.
C: MAYOR
D: He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
C: HILDY
D: Go on, you'd kill your mother to get elected!
C: MAYOR
D: That's a horrible thing to say, Miss Johnson, about anybody! Now, look here, Walter, you're an intelligent man --
E: to Burns
C: BURNS
D: Just a minute. All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let's have your story.
E: interrupting to Pinkus
C: PINKUS
D: Well, I been married for ten years and --
C: BURNS
D: Skip all that.
E: interrupting
C: MAYOR
D: Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
E: loudly
C: HARTMAN
D: I was just going to!
E: springing to obey
N: He gets the key from the officer.
C: MAYOR
D: Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
C: HARTMAN
D: I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
E: unlocking the handcuffs
N: They are set free.
C: HILDY
D: You guys better quit politics and take in washing.
C: MAYOR
D: Sheriff, this document is authentic! Earl Williams has been reprieved, this Commonwealth has been spared the painful necessity of shedding blood.
E: looking over the reprieve
C: BURNS
D: Save that for the Tribune.
C: MAYOR
D: What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
E: to Pinkus
C: PINKUS
D: That's right.
N: He shows the Mayor a locket.
C: PINKUS
D: Here's the picture of my wife.
C: MAYOR
D: A very fine-looking women.
C: PINKUS
D: She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
E: mysteriously angered
C: MAYOR
D: I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
C: BURNS
D: Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
C: HILDY
D: Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
C: BURNS
D: And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
C: MAYOR
D: Don't make any hasty decisions, Mr. Burns, you might run into a thumping big libel suit.
C: HILDY
D: You're going to run into the Governor.
C: MAYOR
D: Now, my old friend the Governor and I understand each other perfectly.
E: trying to brush it off
C: HARTMAN
D: And so do I!
E: eagerly
C: MAYOR
D: So do you what, you hoodoo! And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
E: with superb contempt to Pinkus, suavely
N: The Sheriff, Pinkus and the Mayor go out of scene.
C: BURNS
D: Wait till those two future jailbirds read the Morning Post tomorrow.
E: dreamily
N: Walter turns to Hildy and they suddenly smile at each other.
C: HILDY
D: How was that for a tight squeeze?
C: BURNS
D: Don't tell me you were worried!
C: HILDY
D: Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
C: BURNS
D: Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
C: HILDY
D: In a way.
C: BURNS
D: I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
E: laughs
C: HILDY
D: We've certainly been in some swell jams.
C: BURNS
D: Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
C: HILDY
D: Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
C: BURNS
D: Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
C: HILDY
D: We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
E: laughing
C: BURNS
D: In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
C: HILDY
D: Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
N: She breaks off. There is a moment's pause.
C: BURNS
D: Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
C: HILDY
D: That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
C: BURNS
D: Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
E: glancing at the clock
C: HILDY
D: Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
C: BURNS
D: Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
C: HILDY
D: Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
C: BURNS
D: He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
C: HILDY
D: I don't know what to do, Walter.
C: BURNS
D: Flip a coin.
C: HILDY
D: All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
E: takes coin from her bag
N: CLOSEUP BURNS gazing nervously at the hand holding the coin.
C: BURNS
D: Ready.
N: CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY She flips and catches the coin. She holds it tightly clasped in her hand, afraid to look. They stare at each other a second.
C: BURNS
D: Well -- what is it?
E: nervously
C: HILDY
D: What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
E: almost breaking
N: She puts the coin away without looking at it. Burns rushes to her, tries to take her in his arms.
C: BURNS
D: Hildy!
C: HILDY
D: Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
E: furiously
C: BURNS
D: Then why are you doing it?
E: softly
C: HILDY
D: Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
T: DISSOLVE TO:

CAMERA DRAWS BACK to rest of story: "Impeachment Proceedings Launched Against Mayor For Attempting to Conceal Governor's Reprieve!" CAMERA DRAWS BACK FURTHER to the by-line -- By Hildegarde Johnson. CAMERA DRAWS BACK STILL FURTHER to disclose Burns and Hildy looking at paper on Burns' desk.
C: BURNS
D: The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
E: enthusiastically
C: HILDY
D: Thanks.
E: grimly
C: BURNS
D: And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
C: HILDY
D: Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
C: BURNS
D: What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
C: HILDY
D: No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
N: CLOSEUP BURNS
C: BURNS
D: Where'd you wire him?
C: HILDY
D: On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
C: BURNS
D: Sure.
N: MED. SHOT
C: HILDY
D: It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
C: BURNS
D: Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
C: HILDY
D: Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
C: BURNS
D: Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
C: HILDY
D: A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
C: BURNS
D: That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
C: HILDY
D: Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
C: BURNS
D: Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
C: HILDY
D: Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
E: jumping
C: BURNS
D: Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
C: HILDY
D: Walter!
C: BURNS
D: Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
C: HILDY
D: What would you do if it was a daughter?
C: BURNS
D: Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
C: HILDY
D: What's the matter with my brains?
C: BURNS
D: What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
C: HILDY
D: Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
C: BURNS
D: I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
N: MED. SHOT AT DOOR Louie marches in with a judge, half-dressed. Louie has the judge in a tight grip. MED. CLOSE SHOT
C: BURNS
D: Hello, Judge!
C: JUDGE
D: This is an outrage, Mr. Burns! Sending a gunman to kidnap me!
C: BURNS
D: Now, wait a minute, Judge. This isn't a kidnapping. You've got the legal power to perform a marriage ceremony, haven't you?
C: HILDY
D: What!
C: BURNS
D: Now don't argue, Hildy. How about it, Judge?
E: to Judge
C: JUDGE

E: to Burns
N: Burns starts searching his pockets, then, to Hildy:
C: BURNS
D: How about Bruce's?
E: he takes ring off
C: HILDY
D: Walter, you can't do that!
C: BURNS
D: Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him! "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."
