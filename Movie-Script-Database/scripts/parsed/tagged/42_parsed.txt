N: Fills the screen. Falling from the top of frame to the bottom. Pluming off into dust. White, white, white. We move toward it even as it recedes, always out of reach. Finally we pop out wide and high to reveal... The white is chalk. An old BLACK GROUNDSKEEPER lays down the right field line on a baseball diamond.

N: Blinds closed. Dust motes in the air. A large GOLDFISH TANK bubbles. BRANCH RICKEY at his desk. Two photos on the wall: Abe Lincoln & Leo Durocher. CHALKBOARDS covered with 100's OF NAMES, every player in the Dodger organization. CLYDE SUKEFORTH and HAROLD PARROTT sit across from Rickey who stares at them. Sukeforth stares back. Parrott nervous.
C: RICKEY
D: Gentlemen, I have a plan... As of now, only the Board of Directors and my family know.
N: Sukeforth and Parrott exchange a look.
C: SUKEFORTH
D: A plan's always good, Mr. Rickey. And you always got one.
C: RICKEY
D: My wife says I'm too old, That my health isn't up to it. My son says that every one in baseball will be against me. But I'm going to do it.
N: Parrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey.
C: SUKEFORTH
D: Do what, Mr. Rickey?
C: RICKEY
D: I'm going to bring a Negro ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers.
C: PARROTT
D: With all due respect, sir, have you lost your mind? Imagine the abuse you'll take from the newspapers alone. Never mind how it'll play on Flatbush. Please, Mr. Rickey.

N: The big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot, feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights.
C: CATCHER
D: Where'd you learn to move like that, runner?! At dime a dance night?! Stay quiet! INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in âSAFE!â A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher:
C: RUNNER
D: Is that the best you got?! Huh?! I'm going to steal nine, ten bases today! You better start counting! The catcher frowns. Standing, we see he is a big, big man.
N: CATCHER (ALABAMAN) Where's your shortstop from? JOHN SCOTT (LOUISIANAN) California.
C: CATCHER
D: He's got a mouth on him. Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch, signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off again. The catcher fires to THIRD: âSafe!â
C: RUNNER
D: You got a rag arm, catcher!
C: CATCHER
D: Steal home! You'll find out what kind of arm I got!
N: DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 3.

D: Okay, I'm coming! The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles.
C: CATCHER
D: California, huh?
N: (SCOTT NODS) Well California here he goes, if he comes down here. The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing off third. Here comes the wind-up... The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides -- The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner. ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to the UMPIRE. He never heard the call.
C: JACK
D: What was I? The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes -- The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back. As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --

D: Here. Jack Roosevelt Robinson. As Parrott sets them on the desk, they start to slide off, spilling to the floor. Helpless to stem the tide, Parrott looks down, surrounded by black faces...
C: RICKEY
D: A four sport college man, out of UCLA. That means he's played with white boys.
E: flips through file
N: (SCANS FILE) Twenty-six years old, now with the Kansas City Monarchs. Batting over 350 even as we speak. 350! And he was a commissioned army officer!
C: SUKEFORTH
D: He was court-martialed. A trouble maker. He argues with umpires. A quick temper is his reputation. Rickey is obviously keen on him.
C: PARROT
D: What was he court-martialed for?
C: RICKEY
D: For refusing to sit in the back of a military bus. Ft. Hood, Texas. The driver asked him to move back. The MPs had to take him off.
E: checks the file
N: DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 5.
C: SUKEFORTH

N: A BLOODHOUND watches as a BUS pulls into a SERVICE STATION, the tires RING the bell hose. A million miles easy on this road rumbler. The BANNER reads: KC Monarchs. Insert: Interstate 24, Missouri - August 24, 1945. The DRIVER steps off. The fellas follow, getting off to stretch their legs. Hot and tired. A WHITE ATTENDANT saunters out. The driver steps over to meet him.

D: Fill her up?
C: DRIVER
D: Yes, sir. The attendant starts unscrewing caps on two 50-GALLON TANKS.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Where you all headed?
C: DRIVER
D: Chicago. As the attendant shoves down a pump, starts filling, Jack steps off. He spots and heads for a restroom. White Men Only lettered on the door. The attendant roused as he sees.

D: I'm going to the toilet.

D: Shit, boy, c'mon. You know you can't go in there. Jack does a slow burn, then suddenly strides toward the attendant. The air rife with tension.
C: JACK
D: Take that hose out of the tank.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Huh?
N: DRIVER ROBINSON --
C: JACK
D: Take it out. We'll get our ninety- nine gallons of gas someplace else. The attendant blinks. He takes a look from Jack to up and down the deserted highway. No business in sight.

N: Blinds closed. Jack sits across the desk from Rickey. Sukeforth sits a little further back. Rickey is staring at Jack. Bushy eyebrows flared, light gleams off his glasses. INSERT: August 28, 1945. Brooklyn. Jack doesn't know what to do, looks to Sukeforth. Finally...
C: RICKEY
D: Do you have a girl?

N: WHITE 3-14-12 8.
C: JACK
D: I don't make much money. Between the army and now baseball I've been away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she wants to finish school. Considering all that, I say I think so.
C: RICKEY
D: Do you love her? Rachel?
N: (JACK CONFUSED) Don't you know?
C: JACK
D: Yes, sir, very much.
C: RICKEY
D: Marry her. What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.
C: RICKEY
D: Baseball's a hard life; a man needs a good woman by his side. You don't want the only person waiting for you at home to be a catcher. Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.
E: CONT'D
C: JACK
D: Coach Sukeforth here said you were starting a new Negro League. That doesn't make sense to me.
C: MR. RICKEY
D: It doesn't, huh? Are you calling us liars, Jack?
C: JACK
D: What's this about, Mr. Rickey?
C: RICKEY
D: This is about baseball. Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal.
C: RICKEY
D: I see you starting in the spring with our affiliate in Montreal. If you make it there, we'll try you down here with the Dodgers. The white Brooklyn Dodgers. Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right.
E: CONT'D
N: BLUE REV 4-07-12 9.
C: RICKEY
D: I'll pay you $600 a month and a $3,500 bonus when you sign the contract. Is that agreeable? Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming.
E: CONT'D
C: JACK
D: Yes, sir. That's fine.
C: RICKEY
D: There is one condition. I have a pile of scouting reports. I know you can hit behind the runner, that you can read a pitch. The question is can you control your temper?
C: JACK
D: My temper?
C: RICKEY
D: Yes your temper! Are you deaf?! Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there, fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there:
C: RICKEY
D: He looks proud. Willful.
E: CONT'D
C: SUKEFORTH
D: He'll need to be. Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused.
C: RICKEY
D: I want to win! I want ballplayers who can win! Are you one of them?!
C: JACK
D: Yes.
C: RICKEY
D: A black man in white baseball. Imagine the reaction. The vitriol. Rickey strides forward, gets in his face.

E: CONT'D adopts a new voice
N: (LOOMING) What are you going to do then? Fight him? Ruin all my plans? Answer me, you black sonofabitch! JACK (MASTERS HIMSELF) Do you want a ballplayer who doesn't have the guts to fight back? Is that what you want?
C: RICKEY
D: I want one who has the guts not to fight back! There are people who will not like this. They will do anything to get you to react. If you echo a curse with a curse, they will only hear yours. Follow a blow with a blow and they will say a Negro lost his temper; that the Negro does not belong. Your enemy will be out in force, but you can not meet him on his own low ground. We win with hitting, running and fielding, nothing else. We win if the world is convinced of two things: that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer. Like our Savior, you must have the guts to turn the other cheek. Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out.
C: RICKEY
D: Can you do it? Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses.
E: CONT'D

C: RICKEY
D: Pop Lloyd.
C: SMITH
D: Not Honus Wagner?
C: RICKEY
D: Wagner is number two. And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25. Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list?
C: SMITH
D: He won't break it. He doesn't have a shortstop's arm. Robinson belongs on second base.
C: RICKEY
D: Alright then, where would he rate at second?
C: SMITH
D: If he was playing now he'd be the best second baseman in the majors.
C: RICKEY
D: High praise. He'll have to be the best in the minor leagues first.
C: SMITH
D: What are you saying, Mr. Rickey?
C: RICKEY
D: I'm saying it's going to be a very interesting spring training. A lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over, we can train down in Florida again.

C: SMITH
D: Fifty dollars a week.
C: RICKEY
D: I will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson. You will watch over him, help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn. You will act as his chauffeur, you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be, help him find restaurants, etc...

D: What's in it for me? Besides the fifty dollars and a whole lot of aggravation?
C: RICKEY

C: RICKEY
D: Listen to this, Harold. Whenever I hear a white man - yours truly - broadcasting what a Moses he is to the Negro race, then I know the latter needs a bodyguard. (Parrott tries to
C: INTERJECT)
D: It is those of the carpetbagger stripe of the white race - me again - who under the guise of helping, in truth are using the Negro for their own selfish interest, thereby retarding the race! Parrott tries to interrupt again, but Rickey is furious.
C: RICKEY
D: The minor league commissioner of baseball said that! I pay part of his salary! You wouldn't stab me in the back like this, would you?

Reese and Stanky passing a medicine ball.

D: How about the shortstop making all the errors, tried to kill himself by jumping out on the highway?
C: BRAGAN
D: A bus just missed him. Drove right between his legs! As the bus passes by, Jack sees the impassive faces of Dixie Walker, Reiser, Stanky, Pee Wee Reese and finally 20-year-old Branca. Branca smiles, offers an awkward little wave.
C: SMITH

C: JACK
D: I'm just a ballplayer, Mr. Brock.

D: To be natural, to impose no restrictions on themselves. To all work together in harmony. WHACK! The hit & run is on. The man on first runs on the pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and 2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly and catch it before it hits the ground. He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner out before he can get back to first. Â Rickey is astounded.
C: RICKEY
D: That was superhuman.
N: HOPPER (CHUCKLING) Superhuman? Don't get carried away, Mr. Rickey, that's still a Nigger out there. Rickey takes a moment to process. It's Hopper's light admonishing tone that really halts him. Finally...
C: RICKEY
D: Clay, I realize that attitude is part of your heritage; that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mother's breast, so I will let it pass. But I will add this: you can manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed. They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them.

But still, when this fine young Negro man steps on that field today, he and the Dodgers will technically be breaking the law.

Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On the wind-up, Jack goes. Bragan stands -- it's a PITCH OUT. Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN.

N: SMITH âAS JACK' I did not know that.
C: SMITH
D: Cooked for him for years, but never once broke bread with him. I'd go to work with daddy sometimes. Play baseball out on the lawn with Mr. Ford's grandchildren. We all had a real good time. But it was understood, if they got tired of playing ball and moved inside to the bowling alley or swimming pool, I was not invited or allowed. The grass was as far as I got. So guess what? You're not the only one with something at stake here.

D: Jack stalks down past the team. No one looks at him. Bragan is ashamed. Dixie tries to look disinterested. Stanky and Reese exchange a helpless glance as Jack continues into:
C: THE TUNNEL
D: Like a bull on his way to slaughter, he revolts. WHAM-WHAM! He proceeds to turn his bat into SPLINTERS. Concrete chips, wood flies. Jack drops the handle of the bat, pounds his fists. Heaving for breath, framed by the empty tunnel. Raw, electric, ungovernable. All the anger on display, the fury. FEET SCRAPE. Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there, watching, afraid to get too much closer.
C: JACK
D: To hell with this. The next white son of a bitch who opens his mouth, I'll smash his goddamn teeth in. Rickey stands there until finally, opening his mouth...

C: JACK
D: Is that so?

D: And not a damn thing I can do about it.
C: RICKEY
D: Of course there is! You can stand up and hit! You can get on base and you can score! You can win this game for us! We need you as well! Everyone needs you. You're medicine, Jack. Rickey reaches out, touches the wall to stay standing. Jack just breathes as familiar sounds reverb down the tunnel.

Jack nonchalantly sticks his bat out, pokes a soft hit past second. A nothing hit, but he's standing on first. And he looks, well, ferocious in fact. As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box... Jack stares at Dutch Leonard. Assassin's eyes as he takes an insolent, in-your-face lead off first. Dutch fires to first. Jack dives back safe! Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up sliding back on his belly. Not bothering to dust himself off, he's turning into something elemental before our eyes.

Slaughter swings, hits a hard ground ball right at Reese who fires over to Jack at first. Slaughter is out by fifteen feet, but he never slows down. And his foot comes down -- -- High on Jack's right calf. Slaughter's spiked him something wicked. Jack goes down in a heap clutching his leg, blood already seeping through his high socks.

C: JACK
D: I'm home.
C: RACHEL
D: Safe.
N: (RE: HOUSE) The baby's sleeping so don't you make a sound. He makes to button his lips.
C: RACHEL
D: Stay just like that. She kisses him. And kisses him. And he kisses her back. As they finally head inside, we let them go. And as we're left looking down the street, a crawl begins:
N: BLUE REV 4-07-12 120. Branch Rickey was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1967. Pee Wee Reese was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1984. Bobby Bragan retired the following year and became a manager in the Dodger minor leagues. He is credited with mentoring several African American minor league players. Wendell Smith became the first African-American sportswriter to join the Baseball Writers Association in 1948. Ben Chapman was fired in 1948 and never managed again. Eddie Stanky went on to manage the St. Louis Cardinals, the Chicago White Sox and the Texas Rangers. Ralph Branca lives and works in Rye, New York. Dixie Walker was traded the following season to Pittsburgh. Ed Charles grew up to become a professional baseball player. He won the World Series in 1969 with the Miracle Mets.

He won the World Series in 1955 against the New York Yankees, stealing home in Game One. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. We end on a montage of Jackie Robinson Day in present time. Every year in April, all MLB players wear the number 42 as a reminder of Jackie's accomplishments on and off the field. The number 42 is the only number retired by all of baseball. We see 42s leaving their dugouts, 42s at bat, 42s in the field, 42s signing autographs, 42s stealing bases, 42s lined up for the National Anthem. FREEZE FRAME on a 42. The End.
