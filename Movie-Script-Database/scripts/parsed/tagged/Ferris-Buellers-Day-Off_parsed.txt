C: TOM

C: JEANIE
D: OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!!
C: MOTHER
D: TOM!
E: JOYCE screams
N: The house falls dead SILENT. We hear footsteps thundering through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP.
C: TODD
D: What's that?
C: KIMBERLY
D: Wait! Hold still!
C: TODD
D: What?!
C: KIMBERLY
D: You heads starting to swell up!!
N: Todd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the hallway. A door open.
C: TOM
D: What's the matter?
E: breathless
C: JOYCE
D: It's Ferris!
E: worried
C: TOM
D: What's wrong?
C: JOYCE
D: What's wrong? For Christ's sake! Look at him!
E: snaps
N: CLOSE-UP. FERRIS An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA. His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side.
S: INT. BOY'S BEDROOM
N: Ferris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties. Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed for work.
C: TOM
D: Ferris?
C: JOYCE
D: He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.
N: CLOSE-UP. FERRIS His lifeless eyes blink.
S: INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS
N: Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead.
C: TOM
D: What's the matter, Ferris?
C: JOYCE
D: Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.
N: Tom takes one of Ferris' hands.
C: TOM
D: Should you call the doctor?
E: discreetly
C: JOYCE
D: He doesn't want me to.
E: whispers
C: TOM
D: Why don't you want Mom to call the doctor?
N: Ferris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can manage is a choked gasp.
C: TOM
D: What?
N: Ferris tries again.
C: FERRIS
D: Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.
E: raspy
N: He starts to get up. Joyce gently pushes him back down.
C: FERRIS
D: I have a test today. I have to take it. I want to get into a good college so I can have a fruitful life...
C: JOYCE
D: You're not going to school like this. Maybe I should call the office and tell them I won't be in.
E: to Tom
C: FERRIS
D: I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!
N: He's gripped by a seizure. His body stiffens and he chokes. His older sister, JEANIE, walks into the room. She's dressed for school. She's cute and stuck-up. A major pill.
C: JEAN
D: Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?
C: JOYCE
D: He doesn't feel well.
C: JEAN
D: Yeah, right. Dry that one out and you can fertilize the lawn.
C: TOM
D: That's enough, Jeanie.
C: JEANIE
D: You're not falling for this, are you? Tell me you're not falling for this.
C: FERRIS
D: Is that Jeanie? I can't see that far. Jeanie?
C: JEANIE
D: Pucker up and squat, Ferris.
C: JOYCE
D: Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.
E: annoyed
C: JEANIE
D: You're really letting him stay home? I can't believe this. If I was bleeding out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to school. It's so unfair.
E: angry, defeated
C: FERRIS
D: Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie. Be thankful that you're fit and have your health. Cherish it.
C: JEANIE
D: Oh, I wanna puke.
E: to herself
N: She glares at Ferris. Her eyes are mascara and vengence. She slips out of the room. Ferris' brother, TODD and sister, KIMBERLY peek into the room.
C: KIMBERLY
D: Myocardial infarction?
C: JOYCE
D: Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right down.
C: KIMBERLY
D: Syphilitic meningitus? That would be a huge family embarrassment.
C: TOM
D: Get downstairs!
C: KIMBERLY
D: If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.
N: She turns sharply and exits.
C: TODD
D: Dad? Does my head look alright?
E: worried
C: JOYCE
D: Get downstairs! Now!
C: TODD
D: Just answer me one question! Is it swelling up? Kim said it was going to get as big as...
C: KIMBERLY
D: A WATERMELON!
E: OC
C: TODD
D: Shut-up!
E: yells out the room
C: JOYCE
D: Get downstairs! NOW!
N: Todd backs out of the room.
C: FERRIS
D: I'll be okay. I'll just sleep. Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon.
C: JOYCE
D: I'm showing houses to the family from California today but I'll be in the area. My office'll know where I am, if you need me.
E: to Ferris
C: TOM
D: I'll check it with you, too.
C: FERRIS
D: It's nice to know I have such loving, caring parents. You're both very special people.
N: CU. FERRIS He acknowledges Tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids.
S: INT. BEDROOM. JOYCE
N: She strokes Ferris' hair.
C: JOYCE
D: I hope you feel better, pumpkin.
N: She leans down and kisses his forehead. Tom pats his shoulder.
C: TOM
D: Get some rest.
N: CU. FERRIS Ferris lets out a wheeze. His glassy eyes follow his parents to the door.
C: JOYCE
D: We love you, sweetie.
E: OC
C: TOM
D: Call if you need us.
E: OC
N: They close the door. The lock clicks. Ferris' eyes shift from the door to CAMERA. A sly, little smile crawls across his lips.
C: FERRIS
D: They bought it.
N: The MTV theme music ROARS IN. CU. TV SCREEN The TV at the foot of Ferris' bed. The MTV logo is playing.
S: INT. BEDROOM
N: Ferris yanks open the drapes. The pall of the sickroom disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight.
C: FERRIS
D: Incredible! One of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second. What a beautiful day!
E: looks out the window
N: He turns from the window.
C: FERRIS
D: Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school.
N: He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV broadcast. A NEW SONG begins.
C: FERRIS
D: Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right?
N: He equalizes the sound a little.
C: FERRIS
D: This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count.
N: He exits into the hallway.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Ferris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's debris. He turns on the shower water.
C: FERRIS
D: I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school?
N: He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops up.
C: FERRIS
D: I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit.
N: He steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the shower door we see Ferris' outline.
C: FERRIS
D: That I care about it was.
S: INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.
N: Inside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up. It's moulded into a fin with shampoo.
C: FERRIS
D: It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European. So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car.
N: He turns the shower head around and uses it like a microphone.
C: FERRIS
D: WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT...
E: sings
S: INT. HALLWAY. LATER
N: Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different color.
C: FERRIS
D: Not that I condone fascism. Or and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an "ism". He should believe in himself. John Lennon said it on his first solo album. "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.
N: He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it.
C: FERRIS
D: I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people.
N: He passes CAMERA and goes into his room.
C: FERRIS
D: I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective...
E: OC
S: INT. BEDROOM
N: Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed.
C: FERRIS
D: My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam. So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?" Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks. Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy.
E: snaps his fingers pause
N: He opens his door.
S: INT. CLOSET
N: The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts.
C: FERRIS
D: My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not.
N: He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and puts it on. He drops the towel.
S: INT. BEDROOM
N: He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the top of the dresser. He picks it up.
C: FERRIS
D: In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue.
N: He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he speaks.
C: FERRIS
D: His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him. I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station. His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her. It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her. My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail. I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here. I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped. But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point. I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing". ... Nothing was wrong. There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying. He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit? My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house.
E: pause
N: He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his speech as he disrobes.
C: FERRIS
D: Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost. It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station.
S: INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE
N: Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely different outfit.
C: FERRIS
D: One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act.
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the refrigerator.
C: FERRIS
D: That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food. I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out.
N: He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice.
C: FERRIS
D: You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy.
N: He crosses to the pantry.
C: FERRIS
D: You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun.
N: He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos.
C: FERRIS
D: Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right.
S: INT. FAMILY ROOM
N: Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair.
C: FERRIS
D: There's alot of pressure at work in my age group. And it's not always recognized.
N: He reaches over and picks up the telephone. He sets it in his lap.
C: FERRIS
D: Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart, he looks at someone like me and thinks, "This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about?"
N: CU. PHONE He punches out a number.
S: INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS
N: He remote controls the TV on.
C: FERRIS
D: That's just one reason why I need a day off every now and then.
S: EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE
N: A sleek, modern house on a couple of deeply wooded acres. A prime house in a prime location. A telephone rings OVER.
S: INT. BOY'S BEDROOM
N: It's a dark, dreary sick room. Shades drawn, floor strewn with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the counter remedies. A high school boy, CAMERON FRYE, is laying in bed. We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a thermometer sticking out his mouth. U2's SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY is playing. He's mumbling random words.
C: CAMERON
D: Food...shelter...no...yes...
N: The phone rings. His hand reaches back and hits the speaker phone button.
C: CAMERON
D: Hello?
E: weak
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: Cameron! What's happening?
C: CAMERON
D: Very little.
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: How do you feel?
C: CAMERON
D: Shredded.
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: Is your mother in the room?
N: Cameron takes the thermometer out of his mouth.
C: CAMERON
D: She's not home. Where are you?
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: Home.
S: INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS
N: Ferris is sprawled out in the chair.
C: FERRIS
D: I'm taking the day off. Get dressed and come over.
C: CAMERON'S VOICE
D: I can't. I'm sick.
C: FERRIS
D: It's all in your head. Come on over.
S: INT. CAMERON'S ROOM
N: Cameron's insistant.
C: CAMERON
D: I feel like complete shit, Ferris. I can't go anywhere.
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come on over and pick me up.
N: Ferris disconnects. Cameron slowly hangs up the phone.
C: CAMERON
D: I'm dying.
N: The phone rings again. Cameron hits the speaker button.
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: You're not dying. You just can't think of anything good to do.
S: INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM
N: Ferris hangs up.
C: FERRIS
D: If anybody needs a day off, it's Cameron. He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates. He can't be wound this tight and go to college. His roommate'll kill him. I've come close myself. But I like him. He's a little easier to take when you know why he's like he is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon by French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond. And Cameron would worry that he'd owe taxes on it.
E: after-thought
S: INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY
N: We hear roll call as CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the tile floor. A shoe's POV.
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Albers?
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: Here.
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Anderson.
C: GIRL'S VOICE
D: Here.
N: CAMERA enters a classroom. It travels past a teacher's Hush Puppies and heads up an aisle of desk past dirty yellow Reebocks, rotting Air Jordans, scuffed heels, pristine loafers...
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Anheiser?
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: Here.
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Busch?
C: GIRL'S VOICE
D: Here.
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Bueller?
N: CAMERA reaches the last desk and rises slowly to reveal that it's empty.
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Bueller?
C: GIRL'S VOICE
D: He's sick. My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty serious.
E: pause
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Thank you, Simone.
E: weary
C: GIRL'S VOICE
D: No problem whatsoever.
E: cheery
C: TEACHER'S VOICE
D: Drucker?
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: What?
N: WOUND-OUT CAR ENGINES COME UP LOUD. CU. TV THE ROAD WARRIOR is playing on video cassette. The big chase at the end.
S: INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS
N: He's sitting in the arm chair pretending it's Humongous' war wagon. He's wearing a hockey mash. He's steering. He reaches down and grabs an imaginary nitrous oxide valve. CU. TV Humongous reaches down and grabs a real nitrous oxide valve. He gives it a twist. CU. FERRIS He throws himself back against the chair. CU. TV The force of the rapid acceleration of his vehicle throws Humongous back in his seat. CU. FERRIS He bounces himself in the chair to simulate the bumpy high speed ride. CU. TV The was wagon hurtles down the road. CU. FERRIS He rears back in horror. CU. TV The war wagon is heading for a head-on collision with the tanker truck. CU. FERRIS Arms outstretched, head thrown back, braced for collision. CU. TV IMPACT! MOZART COMES UP. CU. FLOWERING TREE BRANCH Outside a bedroom window. A flowering crabtree branch. Petite pink flowers. WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDOW INTO THE ROOM. It's Jeanie's room. A pink and powder blue pig pen. Clothes everywhere, make-up, books, records. Ferris is sitting on her bed going through a purse.
C: FERRIS
D: This is really degrading.
N: He comes up with a crumpled dollar bill.
C: FERRIS
D: Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest.
N: He comes up with a five.
C: FERRIS
D: Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them. Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on.
N: He holds up a twenty and snaps it. PINK FLOYD'S "MONEY" COMES UP.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: The song plays as Ferris digs through the sofa cushions. CU. SOFA Ferris extracts a sticky quarter from a crevice.
S: INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM
N: Ferris is going through his father's pants pockets. Another crumpled bill surfaces. CU. WASHING MACHINE TOP A couple of stiff, hard, bleached singles that have gone through the wash lay on top of the washer. A hand scoops them up. CU. LUCITE ENCASED PROOF SET An obvious gift from a grandparent. A U.S. Mint proof set. A ten, a five and a single enclosed in a lucite frame. A screwdriver tip wedges between the two pieces of Lucite and pops them apart. A hand peels the bills off the backing. CU. KITCHEN DRAWER Hands ripping through the kitchen junk drawer. Locating a dollar bill. CU. COIN COLLECTION The familiar blue collector's album. One-by-one, the quarters are being popped out of their slots. CU. VACCUUM CLEANER The dusty, dirty contents of the bag are emptied on the floor. Fingers pick a dime out of a matted wad of filth. CU. SNOOPY BANK It's being shaken furiously. CU. BIRTHDAY CARD It's a child's card. It's slowly opened to reveal a crisp, new five.
S: INT. HALL CLOSET
N: The door opens and Ferris thrusts his hands into the pockets of the coats. He comes up with a ball of Kleenex. A roll of Tums. A squirt gun. Then a modest wad of bills. His face lights up as he counts out the cash. He closes the door. CU. FLOOR AND BED Ferris' face appears between the bed and the floor. His arm reaches out for a small metal bank hidden under the bed. CU. BANK It's on a work bench. An awl is driven in between the door and the jamb. It pries the door open. Inside are trading cards, a charred doll's head, a Zippo lighter and, finally, a five dollar bill.
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Ferris is on his hands and knees under the kitchen table. CU. TABLE LEG Ferris lifts the leg and removes a quarter that's been used to balance the table.
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Ferris stands up and pockets the quarter. CU. FERRIS' BED A shower of coins and bills rain down on the sheets. The SONG ENDS.
S: EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE. MORNING
N: A suburban realty company. A cute little building in town.
S: INT. OFFICE
N: Joyce is behind a desk. Across from her are two WOMEN. They're also real estate agents.
C: JOYCE
D: No one's going to consider a house with a black living room. Not even those jerks from Vermont. Let's be realistic.
N: AGENT 1 Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against putting any money into the house. Joyce's phone intercom buzzes. She take the call.
C: JOYCE
D: Joyce Bueller.
N: Her eyes open wide with alarm.
C: JOYCE
D: Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot to call.
S: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL
N: A modern, suburban high school.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Are you aware that your son is not in school today?
S: INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY
N: It's a passing period. The hall is clogged with students.
C: JOYCE'S VOICE
D: Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I had a meeting first thing this morning. I should have called. It completely slipped my mind.
S: INT. SCHOOL. DEAN'S OUTER OFFICE
N: A SECRETARY is at work at her desk. We hear the dean inside the office.
C: DEAN'S VOICE
D: Are you also aware that Ferris does not have what we consider an exemplary attendance record?
S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. CU. DESK SIGN
N: It reads, EDWARD R. ROONEY. DEAD OF STUDENTS. The dean's feet are up on the desk, behind the sign. Moderately priced dress shoes.
C: JOYCE'S VOICE
D: I don't understand.
C: DEAN'S VOICE
D: I just had his file up.
S: INT. OFFICE. CU. DEAN
N: ED ROONEY is sitting behind his desk. He's tough, clean and straight as an I-beam. Short, neatly combed hair, suit and tie. He's toying with a pencil. He's confident to the point of arrogance.
C: ROONEY
D: I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller.
N: Behind him is a computer terminal. He removes his feet from the desk and turns in his swivel chair.
C: ROONEY
D: If Ferris thinks he coast this last month and still graduate, he's sorely mistaken.
C: JOYCE'S VOICE
D: This is all news to me.
N: CU. COMPUTER MONITOR The monitor on Rooney's desk displays Ferris' records.
C: ROONEY'S VOICE
D: So far this semester alone, he's been absent nine times. Including today.
C: JOYCE'S VOICE
D: Nine times?
N: Under DAYS MISSED we see a number 9 suddenly change to a number 2.
S: INT. OFFICE
N: Rooney turns to the monitor. He reads off the screen.
C: ROONEY
D: I have it right here in front of me. He's missed...
N: He looks closer at the screen.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: Ferris is at his Macintosh computer. He has his record up on the screen.
C: FERRIS
D: I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?
S: INT. JOYCE'S OFFICE
N: She's still on the phone with Rooney.
C: JOYCE
D: I can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is, in fact, very ill. I debated whether or not I should even leave him. I can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off, but in Ferris' case, he's truly a very sick boy.
S: INT. FERRIS' BEDROOM
N: MUSIC BLASTS. SOLO GUITAR. CU. SPEAKER The grille cloth is throbbing. CU. LED METERS The meters on the amplifier are totally in the danger zone. CU. TV MONITOR We see Ferris in his room with a guitar around his neck. He's playing. CU. VIDEO CAMERA A home video camera is capturing Ferris on tape.
S: INT. CAMERON'S ROOM
N: He's sitting on the edge of the bed buttoning his shirt. He sighs deeply and fall back on the bed.
S: INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY
N: Jeanie is at her locker during a passing period. A GIRLFRIEND comes up to her.
C: GIRL
D: I'm really sorry about your brother.
C: JEANIE
D: What're you sorry for? I have to live with the trouser snake.
C: GIRL
D: No, I mean I heard he's really sick.
C: JEANIE
D: Who said he's sick.
C: GIRL
D: A whole bunch of people. They said he's like on the verge of death.
N: Jeanie stares incredulously at the girl.
C: GIRL
D: This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's really sweet isn't he?
N: She smiles and exits. Jeanie cocks her head in bewilderment. She kicks her locker shut.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He's in bed on the phone.
C: FERRIS
D: A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily. Freshman. Did you see Alien? When the guy had the creature in his stomach? It feels like that.
E: point to the phone to the phone
S: INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY
N: A FRESHMAN BOY is on the pay phone. A couple of his BUDDIES are standing at his side waiting anxiously for news.
C: BOY
D: Goddamn! Are you kidding?
C: SECOND BOY
D: What?
C: BOY
D: Did you see Alien?
C: SECOND BOY
D: No.
C: BOY
D: You never rented the video cassette?
N: Second boy shakes his head, no.
C: BOY
D: Oh. He's really wasted.
C: THIRD BOY
D: Who's he talking to?
E: to the Second Boy
C: SECOND BOY
D: Ferris Bueller. You know him?
C: THIRD BOY
D: Yeah. He's getting me out of summer school.
E: excited
C: BOY
D: Anyway, I appreciate you letting us know how you're doing. We gotta split. Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on.
E: pause
C: SECOND BOY
D: Shit. I hope he doesn't die. I can't handle summer school.
E: to Third Boy
N: The boy snatches a passing GIRL.
C: BOY
D: Did you see Alien?
C: GIRL
D: Yeah, why?
N: He hands her the phone.
C: GIRL
D: Hello? Who? Hi, Ferris. How's your bod? Oh, my God! You're dying? Is it serious? Shiit! Are you upset?
E: pause pause jaw drops pause
S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE
N: Rooney's comparing his computer monitor to hard copy. His SECRETARY is standing over his shoulder.
C: ROONEY
D: I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him!
C: SECRETARY
D: With your bad knee, you better not throw anybody, Ed.
N: Rooney stares at her for a long beat.
C: ROONEY
D: What's so dangerous about a character like Ferris Bueller is that he gives the good kids bad ideas. The last thing I need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls.
C: SECRETARY
D: He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers, richies, they all adore him.
C: ROONEY
D: That's exactly why I have to catch him this time. To show these kids that the example he sets is a first class ticket to nowhere.
C: SECRETARY
D: Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just now.
E: impressed
N: Rooney looks up at her with a proud smile.
C: ROONEY
D: Really?
N: He unconsciously does an Eastwood squint.
S: EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE
N: It's a glorious late spring day. A florist's truck drives past the house.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He's on the telephone. As he speaks he does a little MacPainting on his MacIntosh. A Modigliani nude.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron, if you're not over here in fifteen minutes, you can find a new best friend. I'm serious, man. This is bullshit, making me wait around the house for you.
S: INT. CAMERON'S BEDROOM
N: Cameron's back in bed.
C: CAMERON
D: I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't you leave me alone?
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: You're not up for some good times? It's a beautiful day. It's almost summer. If this was Hawaii, we'd be surfing.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He's growing weary of Cameron's wimpishness.
C: FERRIS
D: You want to stay home and try to have the shits? Try to barf? Try to feel worse?
C: CAMERON'S VOICE
D: I don't have to try.
C: FERRIS
D: Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed. You're boring me with this stuff.
N: The other phone line rings.
C: FERRIS
D: Squeeze you buns for a second. I got another call.
N: He puts Cameron on hold. He clears his throat and answers the second line. He sounds like he's on his last breath.
C: FERRIS
D: H--hell-o?
S: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING. DOWNTOWN
N: A LaSalle Street office tower.
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: Ferris?
S: INT. TOM'S OFFICE
N: He's behind his desk. Nice office. Two windows. Herman Miller desk and chair.
C: TOM
D: You sound miserable.
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: Really? Darn! I thought I was improving.
C: TOM
D: Were you sleeping?
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: I was trying to do some homework.
N: CU. COMPUTER MONITOR A closer view of the rude drawing Ferris is making.

D: I'm so worried about falling behind.
E: OC
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He leans back from the monitor and sips a Coke.
C: FERRIS
D: Dad? Can you hold on a second?
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: Sure, pal. Are you alright?
C: FERRIS
D: Just a little phlegm on the phone. Hold on.
N: He puts his father on hold.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron? It's my Dad.
C: CAMERON'S VOICE
D: Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?
C: FERRIS
D: It's completely cool. He's just checking up on me. Now, listen to me. I'm working on getting some heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you can do is hurry up and get over here. Bye.
N: He disconnects and gets his father back. He switches back to his sick voice.
C: FERRIS
D: Sorry, Dad. The moment before you called, I had a chest spasm and I blew lung fluid all over the place. It was making me ill looking at it. But gee, it's sure great of you to call. I'm sure there're alot of fathers who wouldn't take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb, sick teenager.
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: Hey, pal, what was I supposed to do?
N: Ferris reaches out and hits a key on his computer. The screen dumps the drawing.
C: FERRIS
D: Give yourself some credit, Dad. It was a mammoth gesture. It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas. It was that kind of concern.
E: looks at CAMERA and smiles
N: CU. COMPUTER SCREEN A message is flashing: "TRANSMITTING DATA".
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He turns away from the computer and puts his feet up on the desk. He lights a cigarette.
C: FERRIS
D: You had to work hard for the money to buy those things, right?
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: Not any harder than anybody else.
N: Ferris mouths Tom's words as he says them.
S: EXT. CHICAGO LOOP. DIAMONDVISION SCREEN
N: Ferris' drawing suddenly appears on the billboard. Pedestrians stop to look.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He blows a smoke ring.
C: FERRIS
D: You work so hard I'll bet you don't even remember where those bonds are, right?
N: Ferris points a finger in the air as a cue to his father.
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: Wrong.
N: He nods.
C: FERRIS
D: Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're just trying to cheer me up.
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: Like hell I am. They're in a shoebox in my closet.
N: Ferris smiles. He looks at CAMERA. He's gotten exactly what he wants.
C: FERRIS
D: Was that a class move or what? The guy gave it up faster than a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my kids don't pull this shit on me. Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and I'd have to support them until I die. I take it back. Dad? All this talking has made me kind of light-headed. I think I better lie down.
E: to CAMERA, normal voice thinks to the phone, sick voice
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: Okay, pal. You take care. I'll call you after lunch.
C: FERRIS
D: You don't have to, Dad.
C: TOM'S VOICE
D: I want to. Bye now.
N: He hangs up. Ferris sighs.
C: FERRIS
D: You win some, you lose some.
N: He turns his desk chair around and gets up.
C: FERRIS
D: I'm so disappointed in Cameron. Twenty bucks says he's sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out.
S: INT. CAR. CAMERON
N: He's sitting behind the wheel of his car.
C: CAMERON
D: We're gonna get caught. No doubt about it.
T: He cuts the engine.
C: CAMERON
D: I'm not doing it.
N: He sits for half a beat.
C: CAMERON
D: He'll keep calling until I come over.
N: He sighs and restarts the engine. Another beat.
C: CAMERON
D: Actually, what'll happen is I'll get caught. Ferris'll escape.
N: Another beat. He stops the engine. A CRASH OF HORROR MUSIC. CU. DRESSER DRAWER Hands curl around the drawer pulls. The drawer is opened slowly, ominously. The hands lift a sweater out. A HERALDIC STING as we see a men's magazine beneath the sweater.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He takes out the magazine. He leafs through the pages for the pictorials as he speaks.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision. The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything. He's the only guy I know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals.
N: He exits the room.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Ferris comes out of his room and heads down the hallway.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron's also the only guy I know who knows what strategic metals are. Pardon moi.
E: waves the magazine
N: He goes into the bathroom. We HEAR THE TOILET SEAT SLAM DOWN.
C: FERRIS
D: MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER, SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED...
E: sings
S: INT. CLASSROOM. LATER
N: A stunningly beautiful girl, SLOANE PETERSON, is sitting at her desk in a history class. She's staring out the window as a tweedy MALE TEACHER delivers a dry, dusty lecture.
C: TEACHER
D: Roosevelt's health had seriously deteriorated by the time he met with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta. Pardon me.
E: sneezes
N: The classroom door opens and the school NURSE walks in. For a moment, the teacher thinks she's come in because she heard him sneeze. She crosses to him and whispers in his ear. SLOANE She, like the others, watches the nurse curiously.
S: INT. CLASSROOM. TEACHER AND NURSE
N: The teacher's face drops as he's delivered an obvious piece of disturbing news. He nods grimly to the Nurse. She looks at the kids.
C: NURSE
D: Sloane Peterson?
N: SLOANE Sits up in her seat. NURSE She's a picture of compassion and understanding.
C: NURSE
D: May I see you outside for a moment? There's been an emergency.
N: SLOANE A smile curls across her lips. As she gathers her books she looks to the GIRL next to her.
C: SLOANE
D: Dead grandmother.
E: whispers
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: The Nurse is gently holding Sloane's hand.

C: ROONEY
D: Dead grandmother?
S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE
N: Rooney's at his desk. His secretary is standing across from him.
C: SECRETARY
D: That's what Mr. Peterson said. I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.
C: ROONEY
D: Who's this girl's going with?
C: SECRETARY
D: It's so hard to tell. I see her alot with Ferris Bueller.
N: Rooney smiles. His suspicions are confirmed.
C: ROONEY
D: Could you get me Mr. Peterson's daytime number?
N: As the secretary starts out of the room, Rooney's phone rings. She stops and answers the desk phone.
C: SECRETARY
D: Edward Rooney's office. Yes. Can you hold? Thank you.
E: pause
N: She puts the call on hold.
C: SECRETARY
D: It's Mr. Peterson.
N: Rooney is startled. He thinks for a beat then reaches for the phone.
C: SECRETARY
D: Do you still want his number?
N: Rooney answers her with an annoyed look. She smiles and backs out. He punches the phone button.
C: ROONEY
D: Ed Rooney.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Ed? This is George Peterson.
C: ROONEY
D: How are you today, sir?
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: We've had a bit of bad luck this morning as you may have heard.
N: Rooney rolls his eyes. It's so obvious it's not Mr. Peterson.
C: ROONEY
D: I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken up. Huh? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to release Sloane. You produce a corpse and I'll release Sloane. I want to see this dead grandmother firsthand.
N: The secretary stops cold in the doorway. She turns to Rooney in horror. He covers the phone.
C: ROONEY
D: It's Ferris Bueller. Nervy litttle punk. I'm gonna set a trap and let his walk right into it! That's right. Cart the stiff in and I'll turn over your daughter. It's school policy. Was this your mother?
E: whispers to phone
N: Rooney's other line rings.
S: INT. SECRETARY'S OFFICE
N: She steps out of Rooney's office and picks up the other line.
C: SECRETARY
D: Ed Rooney's office.
N: Her jaw drops.
C: SECRETARY
D: Hold, please.
N: She puts the call on hold and hangs up. She hurried into Rooney's office.
S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE
N: Rooney's chewing out the person on the other line.
C: ROONEY
D: I'll tell you want, you don't like my policies, you can just come on down and smooch by big old ugly ass. You hear me?
N: The secretary comes in. She's waving her arms furiously. Rooney tries to wave her away. He's angry. She stomps her foot. Rooney covers the phone.
C: ROONEY
D: What!?
C: SECRETARY
D: Ferris Bueller's on line two.
N: CU. ROONEY'S FOOT It freezes in mid-tap. CU. ROONEY'S HAND The pencils falls from his fingers. CU. ROONEY'S FACE A mask of horror. He glances at the phone. CU. PHONE The second line light is flashing. CU. ROONEY He blinks, cocks his head, twitches.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: He's zipping his pants, fastening his belt. The phone's cradled against his shoulder. He speaks in the same voice he used on his father.
C: FERRIS
D: Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need.
S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY
N: He's staring blankly ahead.
C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: Thank you, sir.
N: He nods. CU. PHONE Rooney's finger gingerly presses the button on the waiting call. CU. ROONEY He winces as he returns to the first call.
S: INT. FERRIS' HOUSE. KITCHEN
N: Cameron's on the phone in the kitchen. He's doing a deep, phoney "father" voice.
C: CAMERON
D: You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake! A family member dies and you insult me. What's the matter with you, anyway?
S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY
N: He apologies profusely to Cameron. He's perspiring, trembling.
C: ROONEY
D: I don't know. I thought you were someone else. You have to know, sir, that I would never deliberately insult you. I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am.
C: CAMERON'S VOICE
D: Pardon my French but you're an asshole!
N: Rooney nods enthusiastically.
C: ROONEY
D: Absolutely! I most certainly am.
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Cameron lays into Rooney.
C: CAMERON
D: This isn't over yet, buster. You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes. Do you read me?
C: ROONEY'S VOICE
D: Load and clear, Mr. Peterson.
C: CAMERON
D: Call me sir, goddamn it!
C: ROONEY'S VOICE
D: Sir.
C: CAMERON
D: That's better.
N: Ferris strolls into the kitchen to catch the last of the conversation. Cameron covers the phone.
C: CAMERON
D: I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What is Rooney guesses my voice!
E: to Ferris
C: FERRIS
D: Impossible. You're doing great.
N: Cameron sighs and goes back to the phone.
C: CAMERON
D: I don't have all day to bark at you so I'll make this short and sweet.
E: clears his throat
N: Ferris gives Cameron an enthusiastic thumbs up.
C: FERRIS
D: Great!
E: mouths
N: Cameron smiles proudly.
C: CAMERON
D: I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes. By herself. I don's want anyone around...
N: Ferris smacks Cameron. He's said the wrong thing. He covers the phone.
C: CAMERON
D: What'd I do?
C: FERRIS
D: Out in front my herself? It's too suspicious! He'll think something's up, moron. Cover it.
N: Cameron panics. He holds the phone out to Ferris.
C: CAMERON
D: You do it!
N: Ferris waves his arms angrily.
C: FERRIS
D: Talk!
N: Cameron takes a deep breath. He clears his throat and puts on his father's voice.
C: CAMERON
D: I changed my mind, fella. You be out in front with her! I wanna have a few words with you!
N: Ferris slaps Cameron. The phone flies out of his hand. CU. ROONEY He winces as the phone hits the floor with a loud CLONK! We HEAR THE BOYS SCRAMBLING TO PICK UP THE PHONE, THEN CAMERON CLEARING HIS THROAT.
C: CAMERON'S VOICE
D: On second thought, I don't have time to talk to you. We'll get together soon and have lunch.
N: We HEAR A SLAP AND THE CALL DISCONNECTS.
S: INT. FERRIS' KITCHEN
N: Cameron's rubbing the side of his head.
C: CAMERON
D: Why'd you hit me?!
C: FERRIS
D: Where's your brain?!
C: CAMERON
D: Why'd you hit me?!
C: FERRIS
D: Where's your brain?!
C: CAMERON
D: Why'd you hit me?
C: FERRIS
D: Where's your brain?
C: CAMERON
D: I asked you first.
C: FERRIS
D: How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's going to be there with her?!
C: CAMERON
D: I said for her to be there alone and you freaked!
C: FERRIS
D: My, God, you're so stupid! I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped you.
E: aside
C: CAMERON
D: You hit me. Look, don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way I do it!
N: Ferris is incredulous at Cameron's stupidity. Cameron's anger is intensified by his embarrassment.
C: CAMERON
D: I was home, sick. You get me out of bed, being me over here, make me jeopardize my future, make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students, a man who could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then you deliberately hurt my feelings.
C: FERRIS
D: I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.
C: CAMERON
D: Oh, really?
C: FERRIS
D: Yeah, really.
N: Cameron glares at Ferris.
C: CAMERON
D: Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life.
N: He turns and heads out of the room. Ferris sighs.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron?
C: CAMERON
D: Stick it up your ass, Ferris.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jam you. It was uncalled for.
N: Cameron stops.
C: CAMERON
D: You're serious?
N: He turns around.
C: FERRIS
D: Dead serious.
N: Cameron smiles. He appreciates Ferris apology.
C: CAMERON
D: Thanks.
C: FERRIS
D: You did screw up through, right? Not that is was necessarily all you fault. Right?
C: CAMERON
D: Why?
E: suspiciously
C: FERRIS
D: To fix this situation, I'm going to have to ask you for a small favor.
N: Cameron's jaw drops.
S: INT. GARAGE
N: The door opens slowly, dramatically as we hear a heraldic fanfare. Light streams in to reveal Cameron and Ferris looking at the car. Ferris is smiling with excitement and awe. Cameron is frowning with trepidation and fear. CU. FERRARI STALLION The prancing black stallion. We move up from the stallion to the erotic red hood of a 1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. CAMERON AND FERRIS Cameron's face is ashen. The end of the world is at hand. Ferris is in heaven.
C: CAMERON
D: 1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less than a hundred were made. It has a market value of $265,000. My father spent three years restoring it. It is joy, it is his love, it is his passion.
E: grim monotone
C: FERRIS
D: It is his fault he didn't lock the garage.
C: CAMERON
D: Ferris, my father loves this car more than life itself. We can't take is out.
C: FERRIS
D: A man with priorities so far out of whack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.
C: CAMERON
D: He never drives it, Ferris. He just rubs it with a diaper.
C: FERRIS
D: We can't pick up Sloane in your car, Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit.
C: CAMERON
D: It's not a piece of shit.
C: FERRIS
D: It's a piece of shit. Don't worry about it. I don't even have a piece of shit. I have to envy yours. Look, I'm sorry but there's nothing else we can do.
C: CAMERON
D: He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has it tatooed on his wrist.
C: FERRIS
D: He doesn't trust you?
C: CAMERON
D: No.
C: FERRIS
D: Alright, look, this is real simple. He puts his arm around Cameron.
C: FERRIS
D: Whatever miles we put on it, we'll take off.
C: CAMERON
D: How?
E: suspicious
C: FERRIS
D: We'll drive home backwards.
E: big, proud smile
N: Cameron shakes his head, no.
C: CAMERON
D: Forget it. I'm putting my foot down, Ferris. You'll have to think of something else...
N: CU. FERRARI GRILLE Cameron's protests are drowned out by the distinctive roar of the twelve cylinders.
C: CAMERON'S VOICE
D: ...You're not talking me into this one. I have to live with the man. I'm sorry but...
N: The roar of the engine is overtaken by the sound of a crowded school hallway.
S: INT. SCHOOL. JEANIE
N: She comes out of a classroom. She stops as Sloane and Rooney walk past. Sloane has her coat on and she's carrying her books. Jeanie watches her suspiciously.
S: EXT. SCHOOL
N: The Ferrari is parked out in front. The top is down.
S: INT. FERRARI
N: Ferris is driving. He's wearing a man's hat and sunglasses. Cameron's in the back.
C: CAMERON
D: Are you crazy?! Put the top back up!
C: FERRIS
D: This is perfect top-down weather.
C: CAMERON
D: What about Rooney?
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught.
C: CAMERON
D: That makes no sense whatsoever.
C: FERRIS
D: The adult mind is a suspicious machine. Stay down, man.
E: look around at Cameron
N: Cameron squeezes himself lower.
C: CAMERON
D: Howcome it's my Dad's car and I'm taking all the risk and I have to ride back here?
C: FERRIS
D: I don't have an explanation.
S: EXT. SCHOOL
N: Rooney and Sloane come out the door.
C: ROONEY
D: Once again let me say how deeply saddened I am by your loss.
C: SLOANE
D: Huh?
C: ROONEY
D: Were you close to your grandmother?
C: SLOANE
D: Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah.
C: DEEP VOICE
D: Oh, Sloane! Dear!
N: Sloane looks across at the Ferrari. Rooney looks. THEIR POV Ferris is looking out across the roof of the Ferrari. He's careful to keep his nose and mouth below the roofline.
C: FERRIS
D: Hurry along now!
S: EXT. SCHOOL
N: Rooney's suspicious. Sloane smiles and bids Rooney a hasty farewell.
C: SLOANE
D: I guess that's my Dad. Thanks. See ya.
N: She hurries to the car. Rooney watches her. Something does compute for him.
S: INT. SCHOOL. JEANIE
N: She's watching out the door. She sees the Ferrari pull away.
S: EXT. SCHOOL. ROONEY
N: He can't quite put his finger on what's bothering him.
S: INT. FERRARI
N: Sloane shrieks with delight. She leans across the console and gives Ferris a kiss.
C: SLOANE
D: This is so great! I can't believe it! Right in front of Rooney!
N: She laughs and turns to Cameron.
C: SLOANE
D: Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?
C: CAMERON
D: Hi. No.
C: SLOANE
D: What a fabulous car!
C: CAMERON
D: Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.
C: FERRIS
D: It was risky, it was bold but it was totally necessary.
C: SLOANE
D: What're we gonna do?
C: FERRIS
D: The question isn't "what are we gonna do", the question is "what aren't we going to do."
C: CAMERON
D: Don't tell me we're not going to take the car home. Please.
C: FERRIS
D: If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away? Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend's tension?
E: to CAMERA
N: He smiles.
C: FERRIS
D: Either would I.
S: EXT. STREET. FERRARI
N: It accelerates away like a shot.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN BANK
N: A fresh, modern bank building. The clock outside read 9:53. The Ferrari pulls into the parking lot.
S: INT. BANK. DOORS
N: Ferris, Cameron and Sloane walk in. Ferris is cocky and confident. Sloane's still intoxicated with her freedom. Cameron's having stomach trouble. Ferris leads the way to an open teller window.
S: INT. BANK. TELLER
N: A WOMAN about seventy with a silver blue beehive. It's about four inches higher the highest beehive you're ever seen. As she moves the beehive hits a small sign over her head. She's been at the bank since they opened. She smiles when she sees Ferris.
C: TELLER
D: Ferris Bueller?
N: FERRIS He's at the window. On either shoulder are Cameron and Sloane. Ferris smiles. Cameron blanches.
C: FERRIS
D: Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?
N: TELLER She pats the rock-solid mass of blue hair. In doing so she locates a missing ball point pen. She withdraws it from the hair and smiles at it's reappearance.
C: TELLER
D: I passed a kidney stone Tuesday, so I'm a little pooped but other than that, I'm as chipper as can be. Say, should you be in school?
E: something occurs to her
N: FERRIS He lays his savings bonds on the counter.
C: FERRIS
D: Me? I'm out of school, Mrs. Froeling. In fact. I'm married. This is my wife...Madonna.
E: polite laugh
N: Sloane suppresses a laugh.
C: FERRIS
D: And this is my brother-in-law, ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling.
E: to Cameron
N: Cameron isn't amused.
C: TELLER
D: Is Top a Slavic name?
E: to Cameron
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah.
C: FERRIS
D: I'd like to cash these in, please. We're having a baby and we need the cash for a crib, clothes, diapers, food pellets, leash, water dish...
S: INT. BANK. TELLER WINDOW
N: Mrs. Froeling takes the bonds with a hearty smile. The latter part of the conversation sails over her like a line drive.
C: TELLER
D: A baby! You must be so excited.
E: to Sloane
N: Cameron groans and turns away from the sham.
C: SLOANE
D: I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front.
N: Mrs. Froeling thumbs through the bonds.
C: TELLER
D: Are you hoping for a boy or a girl?
C: SLOANE
D: Actually, we're hoping for a car.
N: CU. CAMERON He's spooked by the games playing. He scans the bank nervously. He blinks, focuses, blinks again. HIS POV Joyce is with a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE and their bored, sour-puss teenage son, BOYD. He's sitting in a chair with his legs slung over the sides waving a Bic lighter back and forth across his rump. The parents are Joyce's clients from Vermont. A LOAN OFFICER is discussing the local financing situation with them. His is an open office adjacent to the teller windows. Joyce's back is to the tellers. CU. CAMERON It's like he's just witnesses an ax murder.
C: CAMERON
D: Shit...
S: INT. BANK. JOYCE
N: Her back is to the teller windows. She's conducting her meeting. Behind her we see Cameron grab Ferris and point her out to him. He waves. Cameron slaps his arm.
S: INT. BANK. TELLER WINDOW
N: Mrs. Froeling shows Ferris the savings bonds.
C: TELLER
D: These bonds aren't mature. If you hold onto them another two years you'll get an additional four dollars...

D: I'm aware of that.
C: TELLER
D: You're throwing away four dollars.
C: FERRIS
D: No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the government. They need it. Do you know what an aircraft carrier's going for these days?
S: INT. BANK. JOYCE
N: She concludes her meeting. She shakes hands with the loan officer and stands. The Vermont Couple stands. Boyd scrapes the bottom of his shoe on the desk, leaving a glob of mud behind and he stands. Joyce turns into the bank. Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are gone. She escorts her customers out.
S: INT. BANK. DOOR
N: Joyce and the Vermont Couple approach the doors. Boyd lays a luggie in the drinking fountain. Mrs. Froeling passes with the savings bonds. She stops when she sees Joyce.
C: JOYCE
D: Mrs. Froeling, how are you?
C: MRS. FROELING
D: I passed a kidney stone Tuesday. Say, you must be very proud.

C: MRS. FROELING
D: I met Madonna.
E: whispers
N: She pats Joyce on the arm.
C: MRS. FROELING
D: She told me everything. Keep me posted, I'll want to send a gift.
N: She toodles on her way. Joyce and the Vermont Couple are completely baffled.
S: EXT. BANK
N: Joyce and the Vermont Couple walk along the side of the bank, heading for the parking lot. Boyd's tagging along behind. He picks up a stone and hurls it into the parking lot.
C: JOYCE
D: My son's home sick today. If you wouldn't mind, on our way back to the office, I'd like to just run in and check up on him.
N: We HEAR A METALLIC PING! as Boyd's missle hits a car.
C: MOTHER
D: Of course.
N: They pass a show window. As they pass, we hold on the window. It's promoting saving for college educations. A mannequin father is congratulating his mannequin son in a mortar and gown as a stiff Sloane, Ferris and Cameron look on proudly.
S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE
N: His secretary is dialing a number for him.
C: SECRETARY
D: This is the Peterson's home.
N: She hands the phone to Rooney.
C: SECRETARY
D: Watch your mouth this time.
N: Rooney glares at her.
C: ROONEY
D: Ferris Bueller's behind this. There's no doubt in my mind. That's what I was saying this morning. Why he has to be stopped. He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this thing now. See?
N: The secretary nods.
C: SECRETARY
D: And her grandmother, too.
N: CU. PHONE ANSWER MACHINE It clicks on. We hear a grieved woman's voice. It sounds an awful lot like Sloane.
C: SLOANE

S: INT. DEAN'S OFFICE
N: Rooney hangs up the phone.
C: ROONEY
D: Something's going on, goddamn it.

C: SECRETARY
D: There's a railroad strike.
C: ROONEY
D: And I'm going to stop it!
C: SECRETARY
D: My brother-in-law'll appreciate it.
N: Rooney looks at her, puzzled.
C: ROONEY
D: What?
C: SECRETARY
D: My brother-in-law rides the train to work.
N: Rooney stares at her like she's crazy.
C: ROONEY
D: Who gives a good goddamn?
S: EXT. EDENS EXPRESSWAY
N: The major thoroughfare into the city of Chicago from the suburbs. The Ferrari streaks past. In the distance we see the Sears Tower, the Hancock Building and the Standard Oil Building.
S: INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY
N: Jeanie's walking down the hall. She's stopped by a KID with a Coke can.
C: KID
D: Yo. We're collecting money to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney.
N: Jeanie stares at him. She's flabbergasted at the proportions her brother's scan has reached.
C: KID
D: They run about fifty g's so it you could help out...
C: JEANIE
D: Go piss up a flagpole!
C: KID
D: Huh?
N: She knocks the can out of his hands and storms down the hall. The kid yells after her.
C: KID
D: Hey, babe! Some day you might need a favor from Ferris Bueller! Then where'll you be?!
N: He reaches for the can.
C: KID
D: Heartless wench...
S: EXT. CHICAGO LOOP. PARKING GARAGE
N: The Ferrari pulls into a large parking garage.
S: EXT. GARAGE
N: Ferris, Sloane and Cameron get out. Cameron's having fits.
C: CAMERON
D: We can't leave the car here!
C: FERRIS
D: Why not?
C: CAMERON
D: Because we can't! I want it back home where it belongs!
C: SLOANE
D: What could happen to it?
C: CAMERON
D: It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched, you name it.
C: FERRIS
D: I'll give the guy a five to watch it.
C: CAMERON
D: What guy?
N: CU. PARKING ATTENDANT He smiles with relish at the car. 6'6", 240. An IQ that equals his hourly wage. Shoulder-length hair stuffed into a hairnet Gold teeth. Earring. Goatee.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT
N: The Attendant swaggers over to the car. Ferris slips him a give.
C: FERRIS
D: You speak English?
C: ATTENDANT

N: He pats the Attendant on the arm. He smiles.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Like it's a beautiful woman.
C: FERRIS
D: I appreciate it.
N: The Attendant very gingerly gets into the car. Ferris turns to Cameron. The Ferrari pulls into the lot very slowly, very carefully. No squealing tires, no revving engine.
C: FERRIS
D: See what a finski can do to a person's attitude? He's going to treat it like a beautiful woman.
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick and piss on the hood.
C: SLOANE
D: Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to be so graphic?
N: She heads down the street.
C: SLOANE
D: This is so right!
N: Ferris nudges Cameron on. They exit the garage and head after Sloane. A long beat and the Ferrari creeps down the exit ramp of the garage. It's gone in the entrance and out the exit. Another attendant jumps in the passenger side. He's skinny, tall, with a huge knit hat willed with dreads. He lets out a spirited laugh and the Ferrari peels out of the lot. It heads down the street away from Sloane, Ferris and Cameron.
S: EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE
N: Joyce's care pulls in the driveway. She gets out and heads up the house.

S: INT. ROOM. CLOSET
N: The closet door is open. The wire from the bedroom door is strung over the top of the closet door. A trophy is attached to the end of the wire and it's resting on a yard stick. As the bedroom door closes, the trophy lifts up off the yardstick and the lump in the bed goes back down to it's original position. CU. FERRIS' SYNTHESIZER Little LED's are lighting up to the rhythm of the snoring. The snoring it simulated.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Joyce listens at the door another beat. She's smiles with relief and affection.

N: HIS POV The Ferrari screams down the avenue and disappears down the underground ramp.
S: INT. SEARS TOWER LOBBY
N: Ferris and Sloane bound down the escalator. Cameron follows glumly. They dance past the giant Calder mobile. They're singing.

D: Yes. You?
C: SLOANE
D: Yes.
C: FERRIS
D: Would I trash a day of education to be with you if I didn't love you?
C: SLOANE
D: Yes.
C: FERRIS
D: Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I didn't love you?
C: SLOANE
D: Yes.
C: FERRIS
D: Would I have introduced you as my wife if I didn't love you?
C: SLOANE
D: Wait a minute. That was a lie.
C: FERRIS
D: True.

D: Sure.

N: Sloane stares at him. Is he serious.
C: FERRIS
D: I'm game.
C: SLOANE
D: No way!
C: FERRIS
D: I'll do it, if you will.
N: Cameron suddenly adds his two cents.
C: CAMERON
D: You need a blood test.
N: Ferris looks around at him.
C: FERRIS
D: Huh?
C: CAMERON
D: If your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead. The state requires a blood test.
C: FERRIS
D: So?
C: CAMERON
D: So, you can't get married today.
C: FERRIS
D: Tomorrow?
C: CAMERON
D: If you get a blood test today.
C: SLOANE
D: I'm not getting married.
C: CAMERON
D: I'm with you, babe.
C: FERRIS
D: Why not?
C: SLOANE
D: What do you mean, why not? Think about it.
C: FERRIS
D: Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer- leader with a husband, give me a good reason why not.
C: CAMERON
D: I'll give you two. My mother and father.
N: Ferris and Sloane look at him curiously.
C: CAMERON
D: They're married and they hate each other. You've seen them. Am I right?
E: to Ferris
C: FERRIS
D: You're father's a toad and your Mom's always wired out, but so what? They're old. That's natural.
C: CAMERON
D: It makes me puke. Seeing people treat each other like that. It's like the car. He loves the car. He hates his wife.
C: SLOANE
D: My parents are divorced. So what? It's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day.
C: CAMERON
D: Just because it happens doesn't make it right. Are you comfortable with it?
C: SLOANE
D: No. It's not something I can get comfortable with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?
C: CAMERON
D: They may as well be.
C: SLOANE
D: Do you think they're staying together because of you?
N: Cameron hasn't seen it that way. He shrugs.
C: SLOANE
D: Do they like you?
N: It hasn't occured to Cameron that his parents might not like him. That parental love might not be a given.
C: CAMERON
D: Yeah. Sure.
C: SLOANE
D: Consider this...my father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything was cool at our house. I thought so. We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over.
C: FERRIS
D: This is all news to me. She keeps a pretty good secret.
E: to CAMERA
C: SLOANE
D: It was pure selfishness. When I have a kid, I don't care how much I want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it.
E: to Cameron
C: FERRIS
D: She's not lying.
E: to CAMERA
C: CAMERON
D: You could change.
C: SLOANE
D: Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to. I'm gonna think about it. I'm gonna try to prevent it.
C: FERRIS
D: This is optomism. It's a common trait with my age group. Adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth. But it's a cool thing and I think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some. They wish they had her, too. Sorry. She's taken.
E: points to Sloane
C: CAMERON
D: I'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you.
C: SLOANE
D: Well, you know what? It ain't up to you. It's out of your hands.
C: CAMERON
D: So, I in other words, I should just sit back and watch it crumble?
C: SLOANE
D: You're merely an inhabitant in their universe.
C: FERRIS
D: Frightening choice of words.
C: SLOANE
D: They call the shots. When you split from them, you call the shots.
C: CAMERON
D: So, you're saying I should run away?
C: FERRIS
D: No. She's saying it's time for lunch.
C: SLOANE
D: What?
C: FERRIS
D: Let's go feed Cameron.
N: They stand up and head out. Ferris hangs back a moment. He cups his hands to his mouth. He yells at the top of his voice.
C: FERRIS
D: BUY!
N: And he exits. Cool and casual.
S: INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE. TRADING FLOOR
N: It explodes with activity in response to Ferris' shout. We HEAR A RADIO ANNOUNCER.

D: Commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading...
S: EXT. RESTAURANT
N: A French restaurant on the Gold Coast. It's noon.
S: INT. RESTAURANT

D: I'm Abe Frohman.
C: MAITRE'D
D: I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right now. If you have trouble finding the door...
E: chuckles
N: Sloane tugs Ferris' sleeve. He ignores her.
C: FERRIS
D: Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am?
C: MAITRE'D
D: Shall I call the police?
C: CAMERON
D: Let's go...Abe.
C: FERRIS
D: I'm not going anywhere. Call the police. Go ahead. Better yet... ...I'll call myself.
E: to the Maitre'd grabs the phone
N: Cameron chokes. Sloane grits her teeth. The maitre'd smiles smuggly. CU. PHONE Ferris punches out a number. A beat and the restaurant's second line lights up and the phone rings.
S: INT. RESTAURANT
N: The maitre'd motions for the phone so that he can answer the call. Ferris waves him off angrily.
C: FERRIS
D: You touch me and I yell "rat!" There's another phone around here. Find it.
N: The maitre'd backs off.
C: CAMERON
D: Ferris, let's split, please?
C: SLOANE
D: Cameron's right. We're gonna get busted.
C: FERRIS
D: Not a chance in the world.
N: He hands the phone to Sloane.
C: FERRIS
D: Ask for Abe Frohman.
S: INT. RESTAURANT. LATER
N: Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are seated in the restaurant. The maitre'd is hovering over Ferris.

D: Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten.
C: MAITRE'D
D: Enjoy your luncheon.
C: FERRIS
D: Thank you.
N: The maitre'd backs away. Ferris smiles. Sloane is impressed. Cameron is flushed with nerves.
C: FERRIS
D: Darling, you were wonderful.
C: SLOANE
D: Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron, dear friend?
N: Cameron looks to Ferris.

C: JEANIE
D: I'm gonna bust his buns.
E: mean, vicious
C: FRIEND
D: Why? What's the point?
C: JEANIE
D: Why? Because I'm sick of the little dope. He manipulates my parents, he does whatever he wants, whenever he wants and he never gets nailed. Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.
E: wicked pause
N: She yanks angrily on the velcro strap on her sneakers. The straps rip off in her hand.
C: FRIEND
D: I think he's cute.
C: JEANIE
D: Sweetie, it's an established fact that you have no taste. Ferris is not cute. He's not charming. He's not nice. He's not a wonderful person. He's an ignorant mule and the sooner everybody in this school comes to that realization the better off we'll all be.
N: She displays the velcro straps to her friend.
C: JEANIE
D: See? My brother strokes you, you sympathize with him, I get pissed off and this is what happens!
N: Jeanie tosses the straps on the floor.
C: JEANIE
D: Let me tell you something. I study hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm considerate, I'm friendly and fair to all kinds of people. Except morons. I try to be everything a good, decent person should be and you know what?
C: FRIEND
D: Everybody thinks you're an asshole.
N: Jeanie freezes with her next sentence pinned to her tongue.
C: JEANIE
D: Excuse me?
C: FRIEND
D: I don't think you're an asshole.
C: JEANIE
D: Who does?
N: Her friend smiles sheepishly.
C: JEANIE
D: Rachel?
N: Jeanie's friend shrugs, wags her head, does everything but verbally confirm.
C: JEANIE
D: Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else?
C: FRIEND
D: I don't know. Just forget it.
C: JEANIE
D: Forget that everybody thinks I'm an asshole? Would you like everybody to think you're an asshole?
C: FRIEND
D: Not everybody thinks you're an asshole. Mr. Rooney likes you.
C: JEANIE
D: Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat fifty year old clod with B.O. likes me.
N: Jeanie shakes her head in disbelief.
C: JEANIE
D: Would everybody be happier if maybe I were to die in a flaming car accident or something?
C: FRIEND
D: Maybe if you didn't cat like and asshole...
C: JEANIE
D: Am I acting like an asshole?
C: FRIEND
D: I didn't mean it that way.
C: JEANIE
D: I this a conspiracy to shit all over me or something? Is my brother behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll sock your tits.
C: FRIEND
D: You really do have a problem, Jeanie.
C: JEANIE
D: Me? I have a problem?
C: FRIEND
D: Somebody who threatens to sock people's tits has a problem.
C: JEANIE
D: Alright. How about if I sock your face?
N: Jeanie's friend gets up.

S: INT. MEN'S ROOM. CHEZ PAUL
N: Ferris is standing at the urinal.
C: FERRIS
D: She's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured. Her body is a transport vehicle for her anger. I don't know where she gets this shit. Basically, the family's pretty cool.
N: He looks down at the urinal.
C: FERRIS
D: I wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals? Probably not many women. I used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it. It used to worry me. Then I met Cameron and I saw how his family functioned.
E: continues
N: He zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron's home life is really shit. He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick all the time. It really upsets him. What he said about his parents hating each other? I refuse to sleep over at his house. His parents fight all the time. Even when I'm there. Is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting? It's the absolute height of social discomfort.
N: He checks his hair in the mirror.
C: FERRIS
D: When they go after each other, Cameron tightens up. It's scary. He gets so wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns apart with a crowbar. The thing with taking his old man's car? It's good for him. It teaches him to deal with his fear. Plus, and I must be honest here, I love driving it. I highly recommend picking one up.
N: He exists the men's room. We hold a beat. A toilet flushes. Another beat and Tom walks out of the stall. He crosses to the sink.
S: INT. RESTAURANT
N: Cameron and Sloane have been served their lunches. They're staring at the plates.
C: CAMERON
D: What is it?
C: SLOANE
D: I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested.
C: CAMERON
D: I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us.
N: Ferris slides over to the table and drops into his seat.
C: FERRIS
D: What are you doing?
N: Cameron looks at Ferris.
C: CAMERON
D: What is this shit?
C: FERRIS
D: You got me. I don't speak French.
N: He puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate.
C: FERRIS
D: I think it's a land-based beefoid creature.
N: He takes a bite. He savors the taste.
C: FERRIS
D: Splendid.
C: CAMERON
D: Really?
C: FERRIS
D: Superb.
N: Cameron and Sloane try theirs. They chew tentatively.
C: FERRIS
D: Good?
N: Sloane and Cameron shrug. It's not bad. A WAITER passes. Ferris stops him.
C: FERRIS
D: Yo, Clouseau!
N: The waiter stops and looks at Ferris indignantly.
C: FERRIS
D: I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here?
N: The waiter glances at the plates.
C: WAITER
D: Sweetbreads.
C: FERRIS
D: Uh, huh. And what might that be?
C: WAITER
D: Pancreas.
C: FERRIS
D: As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism?
N: CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON They stop chewing. They're holding their sweetbreads in their mouths. CU. FERRIS He continues his questioning.
C: FERRIS
D: ...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans?
N: CU. WAITER He nods broadly, knowing that he's spoiling the kids' meal. CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON They look at each other. CU. FERRIS He pats his mouth with his napkin. He looks to Cameron and Sloane. He raises a finger, holds it a beat and gives a cue. CU. WAITER He turns away as Sloane and Cameron spit out their food. CU. FERRIS He watches Sloane and Cameron then glances at the waiter.
C: FERRIS
D: Check, please!

D: 40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to.
C: CAMERON

C: SLOANE
D: I'm not a tramp.
C: FERRIS
D: Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend. A parent. A child... This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic. I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it.
E: to CAMERA

Ferris stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of blue light.
C: FERRIS
D: You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance. You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known.
N: He climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight.
C: FERRIS
D: Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you. Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down...
N: Elvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark ballad sign-off.
C: ELVIS

N: Ferris drops his head. Like the King would.

S: INT. CAR. JEANIE
N: She goes into shock. Her eyes blink, her head cocks.
C: D.J.
D: Sorry about that.
C: FERRIS
D: It's cool.
N: Jeanie draws back and punches out her radio. CU. CAR ANTENNA The impact of her blow to the radio shoots the antenna in the air.
S: INT. STUDIO
N: Ferris leans forward and adjusts the microphone.
C: D.J.
D: He has an incredible story.
N: Ferris turns to CAMERA.
C: FERRIS
D: I'm going to tell a massive lie here. It's going to by very thick and very steamy. I think radio's a facinating medium, it challenges the imagination. Unlike television which provides the images, radio... You know this. Anyway, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the radio. I have what I consider to be an excellent broadcast voice. I practise it in the bathroom all the time. I used to play records and do introductions to them. But I've never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet. I'm going out to several million people so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant groove right now. Well, Steve, you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but...
E: pause clears his voice, speaks into the mike, affects a "radio" voice

C: FERRIS' VOICE
D: ...I'm the first Chicago area youth to be selected to participate in a space shuttle mission.
S: INT. STUDIO
N: Ferris turns from the mike to CAMERA.
C: FERRIS
D: I was going to say I knew Springsteen's home phone number and I was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but I thought I might get busted. After I got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault. I was putting out a cigarette, like I was told. It was weird. I'm so used to getting in a car and lighting up, because I'm not allowed to smoke at home, that I got in the driver's ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny out of my nose or something and I realized what the hell I was doing and I went to put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway, I was so pissed off at her reaction to the whole thing that I considered running an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost too much. I took it again and passed. But I had to work at Burger King to get the cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?
N: He turns back to the DJ.
C: D.J.
D: How did you get picked for this.
C: FERRIS

S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Jeanie and Rooney come face-to-face. Jeanie squeals in horror. She doesn't recognize Rooney as himself but as an intruder. She drops into a karate stance and kicks Rooney in the face. He hits the deck. She flees back up the stairs.
S: INT. CAR
N: Boyd is sitting in the backseat of Joyce's car listening to the radio.

S: EXT. CAR
N: Joyce and her clients take one last look at the house.

C: JOYCE
D: Did I tell you I have a son your age?
C: BOYD
D: Twice.
C: JOYCE
D: His name is Ferris. I think you'd like him.
N: Boyd sits up in the seat at the mention of Ferris' name.
C: BOYD

N: Joyce looks around at Boyd. She gives him a curious look.
C: JOYCE
D: Not that I know of.
C: BOYD
D: I knew he was bullshitting.
C: MOTHER
D: Watch your mouth.
C: BOYD
D: How do you watch your mouth?
C: JOYCE
D: Do you know my son?
C: FATHER
D: Don't pay any attention to him. He thinks it's cute to bait adults.
C: BOYD
D: I don't think it's cute. I think it's fun.
N: Joyce give him a puzzled smile and starts the car.
S: INT. FERRIS' ROOM
N: Jeanie's on the phone. She's in a panic.
C: JEANIE
D: This is not a phoeny phone call. There's an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in our kitchen. My name is Bueller.
E: pause
N: There's another pause. Jeanie's face drops.
C: JEANIE
D: It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but I'm in danger, okay? I'm very cute, I'm very alone and I'm very protective of my body. I'd rather not have it violated or killed. I need help!
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Rooney's plugging his bloody nose with paper towel. The intercom goes on.
C: JEANIE'S VOICE
D: Excuse me. If whoever's in the house is still in the house, I'd like you to know that I have just called the police. If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get your ass out of my house real quick.
N: Rooney stiffens with fear.
C: JEANIE'S VOICE
D: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun. And a scorching case of herpes.
S: EXT. STREET
N: Rooney's car is hooked to a tow truck. It's parked in front of a fire hydrant and the windshield is decorated with parking citations. In the distance SIRENS WAIL.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT
N: The three are waiting for the Ferrari. We HEAR TIRES SQUEALING, AN ENGINE REVING-OUT. Then the Ferrari pulls down the ramp and jams to a frightening stop. A BLACK GUY jumps out. Ferris hands him the parking stub.
C: FERRIS
D: Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp?
C: BLACK GUY
D: About 60.
E: matter-of-fact
C: FERRIS
D: Stunning!
N: He hands him a buck and opens the door and pulls the passenger seat forward for Cameron.

C: FERRIS
D: We have enough cash left for a quick flight to Peoria and back.
C: CAMERON
D: Very funny.
N: Ferris looks in the mirror and changes lanes. He glances down at the speedometer, then to the road. And back to the speedometer.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron? How many miles did you say this thing had when we left?
C: CAMERON
D: One hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and four tenths. Why? How many miles are on it now?

C: FERRIS
D: Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix it.
N: CU. CAMERON He's still holding the stare. He starts to breathe heavily. He's trembling. CU. SLOANE She whips around in the seat and grabs his arms.
C: SLOANE
D: Cameron! Cut it out! What's wrong?! Ferris!
N: CU. FERRIS He shoots Sloane a look.
C: FERRIS

S: INT. FERRARI
N: Sloane fires an angry look at Ferris.
C: SLOANE
D: Shut-up! It is a problem! For him it's a problem. Nothing's a problem for you. But it's a problem for him! So, just shut-up.

E: sings
N: The door slams shut.
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET
N: Rooney's walking down the street. A school bus is crawling alongside him as kids hang out the windows. From inside we hear SHOUTING and seventeen different SONGS PLAYING ON BLASTERS. A top forty montage.
C: KID
D: Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing?
N: Rooney doesn't respond.
C: ANOTHER KID
D: Did you get in a fight?
N: Rooney keep walking. The bus doors open. The DRIVER calls out to him.
C: DRIVER
D: You want a lift?
N: Rooney takes a few more steps. He stops. The bus stops. Rooney takes a deep breath. He climbs aboard the bus.
S: INT. BUS
N: The bus is jammed with WONKS and WEINERETTES. The passengers are silent as they watch Rooney shuffle down the aisle and take an empty seat next to a skinny, myopic GIRL. CU. GIRL She looks at Rooney and smiles. She pushes her Coke bottle glasses up on her nose. CU. ROONEY He looks vacantly at her. CU. GIRL She holds her smile.
C: GIRL
D: I'll bet you never smelled a real school bus before.

S: EXT. PARK
N: Cameron's laying on a picnic table. Sloane's sitting beside him on the table. She's stroking his hair. Ferris WALKS INTO THE FOREGROUND. He addresses CAMERA.
C: FERRIS
D: This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day. We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work. And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it. As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us.
N: He begins to walk. We follow him.
C: FERRIS
D: Sloane's a bigger problem. She still has another year of high school. How do I deal with that? I was serious when I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't just teenage infatuation. That's what my parents call it. What do they call what they have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation.
N: CU. CAMERON His eyes are closed. Sloane's stroking his hair.
C: FERRIS
D: Cameron's never been in love. At least no one's ever been in love with him. He's gonna marry the first girl he lays. And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance. She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work.
E: VO
N: CU. SLOANE She's studying Cameron's face. She looks away.
C: SLOANE
D: Ferris?
N: CU. FERRIS He looks to the picnic table. Then back to CAMERA.
C: FERRIS
D: I'm being tested here.
N: He starts back to the picnic table.
C: FERRIS
D: My best friend has flipped-out. Conventional wisdom would suggest a visit to the nearest trauma center. I wouldn't fault anybody for doing that. My, personally, I think this calls for something new, something bold, something wet and wild.
N: CU. JACUZZI JET UNDERWATER SHOT. A hyrdojet spews a gush of air bubbles. CU. BLASTER A finger pushes the PLAY button on the cassette. MUSIC COMES UP. CU. BEER CAN LID The finger pops a beer. CU. OREO PACKAGE A painted fingernail pierces the cellophane wrapper.

N: CU. CAMERON He doesn't respond.
C: CAMERON
D: Music...kiss...attack...
N: CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS Sloane sips the beer.
C: FERRIS
D: You just can't deal with anymore shit? The car took you into the red zone? Time for a reality check?
C: SLOANE
D: Cameron? I could flip real easy, too. There's nothing wrong with it. At one time or another, everybody goes to the zoo.

C: JEANIE
D: You really want to know what's wrong?
N: The boy shrugs.
C: JEANIE
D: Alright. If you've got the time, I've got the troubles. In a nutshell, I hate my brother. How's that?
C: BOY
D: That's cool. Did you shoot him or something?
C: JEANIE
D: No, not yet.
N: The boy nods. He understands the emotion.
C: JEANIE
D: I went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and I called the cops and they picked me up for making a phoney phone call.
C: BOY
D: What do you care if your brother ditches school?
N: Jeanie stares at the boy.
C: JEANIE
D: Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go?
C: BOY
D: You could ditch.
C: JEANIE
D: I'd get caught.
C: BOY
D: So, you're pissed at him because he ditches and doesn't get caught?
C: JEANIE
D: Basically.
N: The boy nods knowingly.
C: BOY
D: Then your problem is you.
C: JEANIE
D: Excuse me?
C: BOY
D: Excuse you. You oughta spend a little more time dealing with yourself and a little less time worrying about what your brother does. It's just an opinion.
N: Jeanie stares angrily at him. Partly because he's so bold and partly because he's so right.
C: BOY

D: The whole time I was just thinking things over. I was like, meditating. I was thinking about the future. And I realized it doesn't make and difference if the present goes to shit.
C: FERRIS
D: I have a agree with you there.
C: SLOANE
D: Really.
C: CAMERON
D: I've been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word, what would it be?
C: FERRIS
D: Sloane is naked before your eyes and you're thinking about words?
C: SLOANE
D: God bless you, Cameron.
C: CAMERON
D: Thank you, Sloane.
C: CAMERON
D: If you guys only had one word, what would it be?
C: FERRIS
D: I can't believe you'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you.
C: SLOANE
D: Come on, Ferris, answer his question.
C: FERRIS
D: Bathroom.
C: SLOANE
D: I'd say...
N: She thinks.

D: It's the only word you could ever use.

D: Hello.

C: FERRIS
D: Hellos' generic.

D: You wanna be generic?

D: I thought that might be a problem. Let's crack open the odometer and roll it back by hand.
N: Cameron shakes his head.
C: CAMERON
D: I got a better idea. It's cool.
N: He walks back around behind the Ferrari.
C: CAMERON
D: Seventeen years and I've never taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna do it. I'm taking a stand against my father, against my family, against myself, against my past, my present and my future. I will not sit idly by as events that affect me unfold to change the course of my life. I will take a stand and I will defend it. When my father comes home tonight, he's finally going to have to deal with me. Good or bad, I'm taking a stand.
N: CU. FERRIS He turns to CAMERA.
C: FERRIS

D: You trashed the car.
N: Cameron looks across the street.
C: SLOANE
D: Why?
C: CAMERON

C: OFFICER

S: INT. POLICE STATION. WAITING ROOM
N: Jeanie quickly breaks the embrace with the boy as Joyce steps out of the juvenile officer's room. She's still a little bewildered that everybody knows Ferris was ill. Jeanie wipes her lips and sits up straight. The boy adjusts his pants to better hide his passion.
C: JEANIE
D: If you keep this to yourself, I think we can probably get it on pretty good.
E: to the boy
C: BOY

C: SLOANE
D: I had a great time today.
C: FERRIS
D: Yeah. It was pretty cool.
C: SLOANE
D: You think Cameron's gonna be alright?
C: FERRIS
D: Sure. He had to so it, I guess. His old man had it coming. He'll be okay. I'd be worried if he'd taken my idea.
N: Sloane smiles knowingly.
C: SLOANE
D: You didn't have an idea, did you?
C: FERRIS
D: Not a glimmer.
C: SLOANE
D: You're so smart.
C: FERRIS
D: No. I'm just real loose.
N: He kisses her.
C: FERRIS
D: I'll call you tonight.

D: He's gonna marry me. I know it.

S: EXT. BACKYARD
N: Ferris sprints across a backyard. He jumps a plaster elf.
S: EXT. ANOTHER BACKYARD
N: Ferris vaults a fence. He runs directly for a swimming pool. He's approaching it from the side. He leaps, hits the diving board, springs off, does a flip and lands on the grass on the other side of the pool. CU. BEDSPREAD Neatly bundles stacks of bills and rolled coins. A significant amount of cash. CU. SLOANE She's writing. CU. PIECE OF PAPER We see a portion of the typewritten letter as she signs it. "...in the amount of $1,765.33.

S: EXT. FERRIS' STREET

S: INT. CAR.
N: Tom's at the wheel. He glances in the mirror. He does a take. HIS POV. MIRROR We see Ferris cut across a front lawn and into a house. CU. TOM He realizes it couldn't be Ferris.

S: EXT. HOUSE. BACK PORCH
N: Ferris tries the door. It's locked. He reaches down and lifts the doormat. CU. PORCH The outline of a key in the dirt under the mat. The key's gone.

D: How does another year of high school sit with you?
N: Suddenly, the backdoor opens. Jeanie looks out. She feigns joy and relief. She rushes Ferris and hugs him.
C: JEANIE
D: Thank God, you're alright! We've been worried sick!
N: CU. FERRIS A moment of curiosity. Then it dawns on him what's happening. He smiles. CU. ROONEY His eyes dart from Ferris to Jeanie to Ferris. His victory is evaporating.

D: Can you imagine someone as sick as Ferris trying to walk home from the hospital? Kids!
E: shakes her head
N: CU. ROONEY He's dumbfounded. CU. JEANIE She raises her hands and strikes a karate pose. A huge smile passes over her face. CU. ROONEY A look of terror as he realizes that is was Jeanie who kicked him and that Jeanie knows it was he who she kicked.
S: EXT. PORCH
N: Jeanie steps into the house.
S: INT. HOUSE
