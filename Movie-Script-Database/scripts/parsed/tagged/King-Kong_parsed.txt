I'm not that type of person at all!
C: ANN
D: What type of person are you?

C: DENHAM
D: Singapore. On board ship he meets a mysterious girl. She's beautiful ... she's fragile ... haunted ...
N: ANN looks up ... caught by the tale DENHAM is weaving. DENHAM (cont'd) She can't escape the feeling that forces beyond her control are compelling her down a road from which she cannot draw back.

C: ANN
D: She falls in love.
C: DENHAM
D: Yes!
C: ANN
D: But she doesn't trust it. She's not even sure if she believes in love.

D: If she loves someone - it's doomed.
C: DENHAM
D: Why is that?
C: ANN
D: Good things never last, Mr. Denham.

C: DENHAM
D: So you're interested?
N: ANGLE ON: DENHAM hurriedly gathering up his hat and coat. DENHAM (cont'd) That's settled then. I don't want to rush you - but we are under some time pressure here.

C: ANN
D: See, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Denham, I make people laugh, that's what I do.

C: ANN
D: Well, no - not personally. I've seen his plays.
N: DENHAM, sensing her interest, starts to get excited.
C: DENHAM
D: What a writer, huh? And let me tell you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want just anyone starring in this picture. He said to me, "Carl, somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role ..." And as soon as I saw you, I knew -
E: quiet realization
C: ANN
D: Knew what?

D: Nervous?
C: ANN
D: Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?
N: ANN looks taken aback ...
C: ENGLEHORN
D: It isn't every woman who would take such a risk.

D: Why does Marlow keep going up the river, why doesn't he turn back?
C: HAYES
D: shrugs) There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself that sounds a warning, but there's another part, that needs to know ... that needs to defeat the thing which makes him afraid.
N: CLOSE ON: HAYES pauses, filled with a sudden sense of DREAD. He reluctantly turns, his eyes drawn to the creepy CARVED HEAD towering above the SHIP.

S: EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - DAY
N: ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he leads the group into the village. SPREAD among the RUINS is a VILLAGE - a crude shanty town, created by a more recent and far less sophisticated culture ... ramshackle GRASS and BAMBOO HUTS. ANGLE ON: PRESTON looking around, UNNERVED ...

The CHILD struggles and CRIES OUT!

SUDDENLY ANN feels herself DRAGGED FORWARD ... the POSTS she is tied to are MOVING, pulling her TOWARDS the EDGE of the WALL! ANN digs her heels and tries to PULL AGAINST it, but is unable to stop herself being HAULED OFF THE WALL ... .. into thin air! ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS lowering the BAMBOO ALTAR STRUCTURE DOWN, slowly releasing the flaxen ROPE. ANN is dangling from the POSTS by her WRISTS, as the HINGED FRAMEWORK swings her out over the CHASM, LOWERING her towards a ROCK PROMONTORY on the EDGE of the FOREST.

ANN catches a BRIEF GLIMPSE of a HUGE DARK SHAPE propelling itself THROUGH the JUNGLE ... the OILY SMOKE from the FIRES hangs in the air, OBSCURING HER VISION ... she can now only hear the CREATURE'S MOVEMENTS and BREATH as it draws ever closer. ANN cowers back, pulling at her bonds. A MASSIVE SHAPE moves through the air ... The ground SHAKES with a sudden force of IMPACT! ANGLE ON: ANN stands trembling, as the swirling smokey cloud slowly DISSIPATES ... a GIANT LEATHERY FOOT is visible. CLOSE ON: ANN balanced on a knife-edge of TERROR. A SUDDEN PUFF OF WIND INSTANTLY CLEARS THE VEILING SMOKE. ANN slowly LOOKS UP, her face filled with DREAD. The SKULL ISLANDERS reply in UNISON ... a piercing WAIL, from the TOP of the WALL. ANN'S strength suddenly DRAINS from her legs, and SLUMPS between the POSTS. Before her is ... KONG! A 25 FOOT TALL MALE GORILLA! KONG stares at ANN for a beat, leaning forward on his KNUCKLES ... then prods her with his finger. SUDDENLY ... GUNSHOTS!

KONG squats down ... he LOOKS CLOSELY at ANN. CLOSE ON: KONG ... we see him clearly for the first time. A very old, brutish BULL GORILLA. Years of survival have left SCARS on his face. One EYE LID is mangled and his JAW is CROOKED ... leaving a huge yellowed INCISOR TOOTH jutting up. KONG stares at ANN ... she dare not move; only her RAPID BREATHING belies her INNER TERROR. ANGLE ON: ANN is suddenly swung UPSIDE DOWN and SHAKEN ... the ceremonial NECKLACE falls from ANN'S NECK. CLOSE ON: ANN'S HORRIFIED FACE ... she sees HUMAN REMAINS amongst the NECKLACES! Bones ... skulls! A WHIMPERING SOUND escapes from the back of her throat. SWIRLING UPSIDE DOWN POV: The NECKLACE lands on the ground - amid DOZENS of OTHER NECKLACES littering the clearing. ANGLE ON: ANN is lifted UPWARDS ... KONG'S LIPS curl in a low, slow SNARL. ANN looks at KONG, aghast, and in this moment her heightened sense of FEAR gives way to something more fundamental: SELF PRESERVATION! KONG'S FINGERS start to OPEN - ANN seizes her chance! She suddenly PROPELS herself off his HAND! ANN DROPS 12 feet and lands heavily at KONG'S FEET. She rolls amongst grinning HUMAN SKULLS and LEG BONES ... staggers to her feet and RUNS!

The VALLEY is less than 75 feet wide, flanked by sheer CLIFFS. JACK looks up and down the VALLEY ... he wipes his brow .. the SUN is high, it is hot out of the SHADE. ANGLE ON: LUMPY stumbling forward with a hacking SMOKER'S COUGH.
C: LUMPY
D: I'm knackered! I've gotta have a breather.
N: LUMPY flops down on the ground, and grabs a cigarette from behind his ear and lights up. JACK watches as OTHER SAILORS follow suit.

C: HAYES
D: They're not about to quit on you. Cut them some slack.

C: LUMPY
D: There's only one creature capable of leaving a footprint that size ...
E: sagely
N: ALL look up at LUMPY ... LUMPY (cont'd) The abominable snowman! A ripple of FEAR spreads throughout the CROWD. The RATTLED SAILORS mutter agreement. There is random chatter of turning back. HAYES kneels down beside JACK ...

E: quiet
C: JACK
D: Carl saw it. Let's ask him.

D: Leave it!!!
C: DENHAM
D: No!!!
N: DENHAM and JACK scramble to their feet and start to RUN! DENHAM cradles the CAMERA and TRIPOD in his ARMS, as the BRONTO PACK bears down on them from behind! Spectacular TRACKING SHOT: ... The PACK of 15 CARNOTAURS are CLOSING IN on the BRONTOSAURUS HERD! A CARNOTAUR leaps onto the back of a FLEEING BRONTOSAUR, causing it to falter and slide against the cliff. TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past. DENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ... JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM! NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE, out of reach of the MEATEATERS! QUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM ... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS, CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall! A CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head! ACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS. The CARNOTAUR is instantly trampled! BRUCE is managing to stay ahead of the stampede - possibly RUNNING FASTER than any human before him! A CARNOTAUR races out in front of the stampede and bears down on BRUCE with incredible speed! BRUCE desperately waves a TOMMY GUN at the CARNOTAUR ... TOWARDS THE STAMPEDE! JACK sees it coming ...
C: JACK
D: No!!!!
E: yelling
N: BRUCE FIRES, missing the CARNOTAUR ... ... but he hits the LEAD BRONTOSAUR, following behind, in the chest. The BRONTOSAUR COLLAPSES AT TOP SPEED! It CARTWHEELS OVER, it's huge NECK and TAIL thrashing out. The OTHER BRONTOSAURS PLOUGH INTO IT, tripping and rolling! JACK and the SAILORS suddenly find themselves in the middle of an amazing FLESHY FREIGHT TRAIN PILE-UP! SAILORS are crushed as BRONTOSAURS come down on top of them! A CARNOTAUR is squashed when TWO BRONTOSAURS slam together. JACK rolls against a rock as MOUNTAINS of BRONTOSAUR TUMBLE all around him. DENHAM throws himself onto the ground, shielding the CAMERA. n the space of seconds, the MIGHTY HERD OF BEHEMOTHS is reduced to a VAST PILE of DEAD or WOUNDED ANIMALS ... The CARNOTAURS immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into fleshy stomachs. ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS leaps ... BAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls DEAD at JACK'S FEET! HAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN!

S: EXT. SLIMY SLOPE - DAY
N: The GROUP are desperately scrambling up the STEEP ROCKY SLOPE - slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS ... FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the flailing SAILORS! A SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD. The MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot squeeze through. ANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg ...

IDE ON: KONG circles around ANN who lies MOTIONLESS on the GROUND. He PRODS her ROUGHLY with a FINGER ... no response. KONG GROWLS ... PRODS AGAIN ... ANN lies STILL.

S: EXT. EDGE OF SWAMP - DAY
N: ACK, DENHAM, HAYES, BRUCE, JIMMY, LUMPY, CHOY and PRESTON clamber down a JAGGED ROCK face into lush sub-tropical VEGETATION. They are followed by a few surviving SAILORS - a bedraggled GROUP ... CUT, BRUISED, COVERED in DUST, SOAKED in SWEAT. Most of the GUNS are lost. AILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED. They are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE.

N: CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK. He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP. PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby.
C: PRESTON
D: It's not your fault. What happened to Herb - it's no ones fault.
C: DENHAM
D: You're absolutely right, Preston ... And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that.
E: soft realization
N: CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification. DENHAM (cont'd) He died believing there is still some mystery left in this world - and we can all have a piece of it - for the price of an admission ticket!

C: JIMMY
D: So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.
C: BRUCE
D: Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be stranded here!
N: BRUCE becomes aware of JACK staring at him COLDLY. BRUCE self consciously clears his THROAT. BRUCE (cont'd) Miss Darrow was a great gal - no question. She was a wonderful person. It's a terrible loss. We're all gonna miss her.
C: JACK
D: I always knew you were nothing like the tough guy you play on screen - I just never figured you for a coward.
C: BRUCE
D: Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look like me - not in the real world. In the real world they've got bad teeth, a bald spot and a beer gut ... be seeing ya.
N: BRUCE walks off. HAYES turns to the rest of the GROUP.
C: HAYES
D: Anyone else?
N: A couple of SAILORS shuffle forward towards BRUCE.
S: EXT. JUNGLE RUINS - DAY
N: WIDE ON: KONG SITS on the EDGE of a RUIN, surveying the JUNGLE. He SITS with his BACK to ANN, in the crumbling remains of an enclosed ENTRY AREA ... which also provides the only way out. ith a splintering rip, KONG pulls off one of the DINOSAUR'S LEGS and starts EATING it. ANGLE ON: ANN, having feigned unconsciousness, she now cautiously searches for a way to escape. LOSE ON: ANN LIFTING HER HEAD, risking a quick look around. The WALLS are TOO STEEP to attempt an escape ... ... but there is a NARROW STAIRWAY across the COURTYARD, leading down into the JUNGLE. INCH by INCH ANN starts to EDGE FORWARD, CRAWLING on her STOMACH towards the STAIRS. KONG is CHEWING NOISILY ... he SHIFTS HIS WEIGHT, half turning ... ANN FREEZES. ONG GLANCES at ANN, who has resumed her LIFELESS POSE. KONG doesn't appear to notice she's moved several feet. He continues EATING ... ANN again starts to EDGE FORWARD ... she is STARTLED when some CREEPY INSECTS swarm out of a CRACK in the FLAGSTONES, inches from her FACE! With only a few feet left to go, ANN quietly rises and scurries towards the STAIRWAY. She clambers into the NARROW PASSAGE - finally out of KONG'S SIGHT! Glancing back over her shoulder, ANN hurries down the STAIRWAY towards FREEDOM!
S: EXT. BOTTOM OF STAIRWAY/JUNGLE - DAY
N: ANN pauses at the BOTTOM of the STAIRS, listening for sounds of KONG. All is QUIET ... she glances back up the stairs ... no sign of him there ... ... gathering all her strength ANN emerges from the PASSAGE and makes a bold run across the CLEARING towards the cover of the JUNGLE! THUD! KONG'S FIST SLAMS DOWN in FRONT of ANN! She GASPS and tries to change direction ... THUD! Another FIST blocks her way. KONG GROWLS ANGRILY! ANN swings around and FACES KONG ... he SNARLS at HER, FURIOUS and DEADLY. NGLE ON: ANN suddenly ducks under KONG'S ARM and makes a last ditch attempt to escape! She is half way across the clearing when she TRIPS and FALLS! NGLE ON: KONG bounds over to ANN, SLAPPING his HANDS on the GROUND in a frenzy of excitement - he utters a GUTTERAL SQUEAL. CLOSE ON: ANN, flat on the ground, eyes shut, lying still. ANGLE ON: KONG .. circling around ANN, SUSPICIOUS. He PRODS her a couple of times ...no response. KONG moves on ... ANN'S EYES flick OPEN! At that moment KONG doubles back - CATCHING her out! ... ANN SPRINGS UP, looks at KONG for a desperate moment, wonders if she should run, decides she'll never make it ... and takes another PRATFALL!! KONG cocks his HEAD! He GRIMACES, baring his teeth and CIRCLES her. ANN repeats the COMIC FALL! KONG SLAPS his HANDS on the GROUND, SHAKES his HEAD and GROWLS. ANN starts to draw upon her VAUDEVILLE ROUTINE, swaying drunkenly and falling, then bouncing back up ... working her timing around KONG'S reactions - he grows increasingly ENGAGED. NGLE ON: ANN BOUNCES UP ... PANTING ... BEADS of SWEAT trickle down her face. Her EYES dart between the JUNGLE and KONG, she's looking for her chance ... ... but KONG is a DEMANDING audience. He wants more ... he wants ANN to fall down again. KONG PRODS ANN ROUGHLY, knocking her OFF HER FEET. She FALLS to the GROUND ... WINDED. KONG slaps his hands on the GROUND, and lets out another EXCITED GROWL. He thumps the GROUND with his FISTS, and SHAKES his HEAD, delighted with the GAME. ANN tries to get up - KONG pushes her over again! This time she stays on the GROUND, breathing HEAVILY. HUMP! THUMP! THUMP! KONG wants more! He tries to PROD ANN into getting up and is STARTLED when she HITS his FINGER AWAY!
C: ANN
D: No! I said no!
E: gasping
N: KONG cocks his HEAD ... he THUMPS his FISTS on the GROUND. HUMP! THUMP! THUMP! ANN (cont'd) (gasping) That's all there is ... there isn't any more. KONG RISES TO HIS FEET, and BEATS his CHEST, towering over ANN. His HUGE FIST rises into the air and comes SLAMMING DOWN straight TOWARDS ANN! CLOSE ON: ANN shuts her eyes ... KONG'S FIST THUDS into the ground inches away from her. THUD! Another FIST SLAMS into the GROUND! ANGLE ON: KONG ROARS and beats his chest in a dramatic display of ANGER and FRUSTRATION. He rips a TREE from the ground as his ANGER spirals into violent MADNESS. LOSE ON: ANN as the GROUND SHAKES with the fury of his RAGE. For a brief moment KONG and ANN lock in EYE CONTACT! LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is waiting for DEATH to come. In this moment an UNFAMILIAR feeling wells inside him ... a half formed emotion he hasn't experienced much in his long life: he feels a connection to this tiny creature. The SPARK of RAGE goes out in KONG'S EYES ... KONG stares at ANN as a confusion of feelings wash over him. ONG pulls back from ANN ... overcome by sudden UNCERTAINTY. He knows only that she has somehow disarmed him ... and this has in turn, DIMINISHED his power. KONG starts to BACK AWAY from ANN - slowly at first, until DOUBT and FEAR compel him to move faster. Suddenly he turns away. ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT. ANGLE ON: ANN, rising to her feet, finally free of her captor.
S: EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY
N: NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... pushing THROUGH thorns, TANGLED in VINES ... she is EXHAUSTED, THIRSTY.
S: EXT. LOG CHASM - DAY
N: IDE ANGLE: DENHAM, JACK, HAYES, LUMPY, JIMMY, PRESTON and the remaining CREW have arrived at a DARK, VINE ENTANGLED CHASM ... spanning the narrow, but deadly RAVINE is a SINGLE FALLEN TREE. WEAK SUNLIGHT filters through the DARK CANOPY above casting a SICKLY GREEN HUE over the place. IDE ON: HAYES, followed by JIMMY, leads the GROUP across the SLIMY, MOSS covered LOG ... the going is treacherous. ANGLE ON: DENHAM struggling with the CAMERA ... JACK follows HAYES ... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other, trying not to let the DROP unnerve them. ANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS on the other side of the CHASM ... CREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG.
C: IMMY
D: What is it?
E: low voice
N: HAYES motions for JIMMY to be quiet. He stares intently into the DARKNESS of the FOREBODING RUINS. JIMMY (cont'd) (whispering) Mr. Hayes ...? HAYES turns and looks at JIMMY.
C: HAYES
D: If anything happens, I want you to run! Understand?
C: JIMMY
D: I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.
C: HAYES

E: gently
N: CLOSE ON: JIMMY looking at HAYES uneasily, as he continues across the LOG.
S: EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY
N: NGLE ON: HAYES is the first to step off the LOG, to the safety of the FAR BANK. Ahead, some RUINS have collapsed, creating a LONG DARK TUNNEL. CLOSE ON: HAYES ... peers into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL. ANGLE ON: A PAIR of GLEAMING EYES, reflecting LIGHT ... rushing towards HAYES.
C: HAYES
D: o back! Back across the log!
N: The GROUP on the LOG FREEZE, start to BACK AWAY, slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS.
C: JIMMY
D: I ain't gonna run.
C: HAYES
D: Get Jimmy out of here.
N: ANGLE ON: HAYES... SHOOTS into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL. KONG rampages out of the TUNNEL MOUTH! He SNATCHES HAYES with one SWEEP of his HAND. CLOSE ON: HAYES in KONG's HAND ... IMMY yells! KONG's GAZE turns toward the MEN on the LOG!
C: JIMMY
D: No! Let him go! Kill him! Kill him!
E: to HAYES
C: HAYES
D: Look at me! Look at me!
E: to KONG
C: JIMMY
D: Bring him down! Mr Hayes!
E: desperate
N: SLOWLY HAYES begins to lift his PISTOL up ... KONG's GAZE locks back on HAYES ...
C: HAYES
D: deadly calm) You've gotta run, Jimmy.
C: IMMY
D: No! I ain't gonna run.
C: HAYES
D: Do as I say. o with Jack ... All of you.
E: to JIMMY
N: KONG stares at HAYES a BEAT ... HAYES suddenly raises his PISTOL at KONG to shoot! HAYES (cont'd) Run! ANGLE ON: KONG HURLS HAYES at the SAILORS ... he flies over their heads like RAG-DOLL and smashes against the FAR WALL of the RAVINE with a sickening CRUNCH.
C: JIMMY
D: No!
N: JIMMY runs at KONG, blinded by tears of GRIEF and RAGE ... JACK KNOCKS him down and SHOOTS at KONG.
C: JACK
D: Shoot him!
E: desperate
N: WILD SHOOTING from the SAILORS, as they try to maintain BALANCE on the LOG. KONG ROARS ... DESPERATE SAILORS try to back across the RAVINE. KONG runs towards the LOG ... KONG'S FIST smashes at the LOG, knocking the men off balance. A SAILOR plummets off into the CHASM below.
S: EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY
N: NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... hearing the sound of gun fire.
C: ANN
D: Hey! Here! Over here!
N: She runs up the bank towards the noise.
S: EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY
N: IDE ON: KONG has LIFTED the END of the LOG! JACK, DENHAM, LUMPY, CHOY, JIMMY, PRESTON and THREE SAILORS hold on for dear life ... as KONG vigorously TWISTS and SHAKES the LOG, bucking the MEN into the air. ANGLE ON: DENHAM skates on the MOSS and his CAMERA slides away, becoming WEDGED in the fork of a STUMP. LL AROUND panicked SAILORS are SHOOTING WILDLY, but fear and lack of balance throws their AIM OFF. WO SAILORS FALL ... CHOY scrambles for something to grab.
C: CHOY
D: Lumpy! Help me!
N: LUMPY desperately tries to reach CHOY'S hand ... but CHOY slips away into the ABYSS. KONG ROARS with FRUSTRATION, and TOSSES the ENTIRE LOG into the CHASM! QUICK IMAGE: DENHAM, PRESTON, JACK, JIMMY and LUMPY gripping the LOG as it FALLS! QUICK IMAGE: PRESTON thrown off the LOG halfway down ... he manages to GRAB onto a ROCKY SHELF. ANGLE ON: PRESTON is nearest to the FAR BANK ... he LEAPS, and MANAGES to catch hold of some hanging VINES, hauling himself up to safety. ANGLE ON: The LOG plummets into a web of VINES, which arrest its FALL and sends it FLIPPING end on end, throwing the MEN CLEAR into mid-air... DENHAM, JACK and LUMPY land in SOFT MUD which cushions the impact of the LANDING.
S: EXT. VALLEY EDGE - DAY
N: ANN suddenly spins around ... the DISTANT SOUND of approaching FOOTSTEPS through the dense JUNGLE. A flicker of hope in ANN'S eyes! She starts hurrying towards the FOOTSTEPS! CLOSE ON: ANN sees a distant PLUME of SMOKE - over FOUR MILES AWAY ... she hesitates. She SLOWLY turns towards the SOUND of the FOOTSTEPS, which are now VERY CLOSE. Suddenly a LARGE 8 foot tall CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR is in the GLADE before her! NGLE ON: ANN as she quietly backtracks. The CARNIVORE pauses, as if SENSING something. It's NOSTRILS twitch. She ducks behind a WIDE TREE. NGLE ON: ANN PEERING around from behind the TREE ... ... there is another CARNIVORE BEHIND HER! It snares at her ... and pounces! ANN leaps away ... she barely has time to start running before the CARNIVORE GIVES CHASE! ANGLE ON: ANN races past the first CARNIVORE ... the creature turns it's head ... and soon BOTH DINOSAURS are pursuing ANN.
S: EXT. HOLLOW TREE GLADE - DAY
N: NGLE ON: ANN desperately heads towards the TANGLED ROOT SYSTEM of a HUGE TREE. She throws herself forward, as the CARNIVORE'S JAWS snap above her head. NGLE ON: ANN ROLLS and SCRAMBLES into a HOLLOW under the ROTTEN TREE. ANGLE ON: The CARNIVORE CLAW at the TREE, trying to get at ANN. ANN is lying beneath the ROOTS ... all she can see are LEGS and SLAVERING SNOUTS! The DINOSAUR RAM'S it's nose into the NARROW GAP. SUDDENLY ... ANN sees the LEGS of one of her pursuers LIFT off the GROUND - it's taloned feet thrashing in mid-air. he SECOND CARNIVORE turns and FLEES into the JUNGLE, as ANN is forced to watch the twitching legs SHUDDER and FLAIL. The SOUND of BONE CRUNCHING ... CRACK! The CARNIVORE'S LEGS SPASM and go limp. ANN is completely still, she dare not breathe ... whatever killed the CARNIVORE is now inches from her hiding PLACE. CLOSE ON: ANN'S FACE ... as she sees something CRAWLING above her. CLOSE ON: A DARK HOLE, beneath the tree ... Long FEELERS probe along the ROOF of the hole as a HUGE CENTIPEDE CRAWLS towards her. ANN doesn't move as it inches towards her face. Suddenly she feels another crawling up over her shoulder. ANN FREAKS! She desperately scrambles away from the CENTIPEDES ... rolls out on the OTHER SIDE of the TREE and stands to RUN... ... TOWERING above her, with the DEAD CARNIVORE hanging limply from it's HUGE JAWS, is a TYRANNOSAURUS REX! ANN starts RUNNING! The TYRANNOSAUR crashes after her with the DEAD CARNIVORE still in it's MOUTH... as SHE races through the JUNGLE, dodging TREES, leaping over FALLEN LOGS, smashing through BUSHES, the TYRANNOSAUR POUNDING ever closer in pursuit. ANN can feel its hot sour BREATH blowing on the back of her neck! The HUGE JAWS of the HUGE BEAST open INCHES from ANN'S HEAD!
S: EXT. VALLEY EDGE - DAY
N: NGLE ON: ANN slips down a MUDDY BANK, rolls over a LOG, and CRASHES NOISILY through a THICKET of PALMS ...
S: EXT. FALLEN TREE GLADE - DAY
N: ANGLE ON: ANN'S LUNGS are bursting, but the TYRANNOSAUR is GAINING on her ... she manages to scramble onto a FALLEN TREE that juts out over a small CLIFF. ANN clings onto the MOSSY LOG, and crawls towards the END ... the TYRANNOSAUR cannot possibly follow her. She falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying the TYRANNOSAUR doesn't see her. It seems to work and IT walks off. ANN HESITANTLY SITS up, thinking that she is at last free, only to turn and discover another is behind her! With an almost delicate movement, the TYRANNOSAUR nudges the LOG with it's head ... causing it to lurch dramatically! The TYRANNOSAUR pushes HARDER, sending ANN over the SIDE ... she just manages to grab hold of a BRANCH as she FALLS. ANN hangs on desperately ... SHE SCREAMS! ANN is HELPLESS ... The TYRANNOSAUR positions it's HEAD for the FINAL LUNGE - gaping JAWS OPEN impossibly WIDE ... AT THAT MOMENT: KONG CHARGES! KONG meets the TYRANNOSAUR HEAD-ON at FULL SPEED! He swings, with his FOOT smashing the TYRANNOSAUR against the FALLEN LOG ... ANN loses her GRASP and FALLS ... as the DINOSAUR SPRAWLS onto the ground beside her ... in a flash, KONG CATCHES HER mid-fall ... ROLLING AWAY as the TYRANNOSAUR LEAPS UP and tries to take another swipe.
S: EXT. SKULL ISLAND JUNGLES - DAY
N: AST FEVERED ACTION: A pair of CARNIVOROUS DINOSAURS leap towards HER! They cling onto KONG'S ARM, clawing furiously, snapping at ANN! LOSE ON: Saliva flies from wild, snapping jaws. WIDE ON: KONG rolls over, THUMPING his arm against a TREE, crushing a DINOSAUR. ANN is WINDED ... she clings to KONG'S FINGERS as he strangles the second BEAST with one hand, snapping it's NECK with a BONE CRUNCHING sound. UDDENLY! A SECOND TYRANNOSAUR ATTACKS!!! He comes charging into shot, grabbing KONG'S ARM in his JAWS! KONG ROARS, sending both TYRANNOSAURS SPRAWLING TO THE GROUND. The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR scrambles back to it's feet! KONG holds ANN protectively as he braces himself for the FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. The TWO TYRANNOSAURS CIRCLE him ... when SUDDENLY! A THIRD TYRANNOSAUR comes from behind. hey ATTACK KONG and ANN ... a BREATHTAKING FIGHT to the DEATH. KONG fights like a madman on three separate fronts ... Not only does he have to do battle with the TYRANNOSAURS, he is also PROTECTING ANN - constantly transferring her from ONE HAND to THE OTHER as the TYRANNOSAURS SNAP AT HER HEELS. KONG punches and smashes with his fists, but he also uses wrestling-style headlocks and flips ... for a brief moment, ANN rolls free on the ground and has to dodge 25-foot DINOSAURS and the GORILLA, as the frenzied fight THUNDERS all around her. The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR is taken out when KONG LIFTS up a HUGE BOULDER and SMASHES it against the TYRANNOSAUR'S HEAD. KONG and the TWO TYRANNOSAURS slide down on to a ROCKY OUTCROP. KONG outs the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR in a HEADLOCK, FLIPPING it over his shoulder, and throwing it down into the CHASM. CLINGING ONTO THE LEDGE KONG PULLS THE FIRST TYRANNOSAUR OFF THE LEDGE ... BUT AS IT FALLS it SNAPS AT KONG'S FOOT. KONG ROARS IN PAIN AND TOGETHER THEY FALL DOWN INTO THE CHASM ... DOWN INTO THE VINES. KONG CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE TYRANNOSAUR, AS ANN IS LEFT SWINGING, CAUGHT UP IN THE VINES ... TOWARDS THE SECOND TYRANNOSAUR. HE SNAPS AT HER AS SHE COMES WITHIN INCHES OF HIS JAW. WIDE ON: KONG SEES AND CLIMBS UP TOWARDS IT, PULLING IT DOWN. THEY ALL TUMBLE DEEPER INTO THE CHASM, AND SUDDENLY ANN FINDS HERSELF DANGLING FROM THE JAWS OF THE TYRANNOSAUR ABOVE THE JAWS OF ANOTHER! KONG SWINGS AND KICKS THE TYRANNOSAUR IN THE HEAD ... ANN LOSES HER GRIP AND PLUMMETS DOWN ... VINES BREAKING AS SHE FALLS. AND more SMASHING AGAINST THE CHASM WALLS ... SHE FALLS AND LANDS ON THE HEAD OF ANOTHER. FALLS AGAIN. SHE LANDS IN THE SWAMP. RUNS. IT CHASES.
S: EXT. CLEARING - DAY
N: WIDE ON: ANN faces the TYRANNOSAUR! SUDDENLY KONG THUDS DOWN BEHIND HER ... GLARING AT THE DINOSAUR ... ANN FINDS HERSELF CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BEASTS. ANN WEIGHS UP HER OPTIONS BETWEEN BOTH ... and for a moment ANN & KONG LOCK EYES. SHE THEN BACKS BENEATH THE LOOMING FIGURE OF KONG. HE TYRANNOSAUR SNARLS at KONG and he ROARS BACK ... KONG THROWS ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each other. KONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE. HE ROLLS the TYRANNOSAUR over and over, using all his strength to force the TYRANNOSAUR'S JAWS OPEN before RIPPING them clean APART at the HINGE! The TYRANNOSAUR sprawls back, DEAD. KONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT. He puts his foot on the LAST TYRANNOSAUR and BEATS HIS CHEST, TRIUMPHANTLY with a DEAFENING ROAR. WIDE ON: KONG KICKS THE DINOSAUR OUT THE WAY. KONG ROARS ANGRILY - his blood is up, he is ready to take on the world. HE STANDS NEXT TO ANN, BUT HE WON'T LOOK AT HER DIRECTLY. SHE TRIES TO HIS ATTENTION BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. HE LUMBERS AWAY. KONG has DEADLY INTENT in his EYES. ANN watches as he DISAPPEARS into the JUNGLE. ANGLE ON: ANN, CONFUSED for a minute ... THEN RUNS AFTER HIM.
C: ANN
D: Wait!
N: ANGLE ON: ANN is roughly SWUNG into the air, as KONG bounds off into the DEEP JUNGLE INTERIOR. ANN as she is suddenly SNATCHED UP by KONG and SWUNG ROUGHLY on to his SHOULDER. CLOSE ON: ANN HANGS ON for dear life as KONG GALLOPS into the JUNGLE. KONG moves SWIFTLY and POWERFULLY through the JUNGLE with ANN on his SHOULDER ... ANGLE ON: ANN as she looks up at the GIANT GORILLA ... the tension seems to go out of her body, she relaxes into his HAND ... for the first time since coming to SKULL ISLAND she feels SAFE.
S: EXT. BOTTOM OF CHASM - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: JACK STIRRING, immediately hearing the SCUTTLE OF INSECTS. HE ROLLS OVER and see's HUGE SPIDERS CRAWLING INTO THE PIT. HE staggers to his FEET ... REACHING INTO HIS PACK and PULLS from it A FLARE. THROWING it at the SPIDERS they CRAWL OFF. DENHAM is lying nearby.
C: JACK
D: Carl!!!
N: DENHAM STIRS, MUMBLING IN PAIN BUT ALIVE. JACK SEES JIMMY. CLOSE ON: JIMMY is looking VACANTLY into space, JACK kneels down. JACK (cont'd) Jimmy? CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks up at JACK, there are tears filling his eyes. He falls into JACK'S arms softly sobbing. ANGLE ON: DENHAM sitting up... dawning realization in his eyes. LUMPY, his back to CHOY ... he HOLDS CHOY'S HAND ... but CHOY'S FINGERS SLIDE LIMPLY out of LUMPY'S HAND ... LUMPY TURNS TO CHOY .. ONLY TO SEE THAT HE has DIED. NGLE ON: HAYES' eyes closed, his FACE peaceful, lying DEAD on the floor of the RAVINE. ANGLE ON: DENHAM PEERING over a ROCK. The wreckage of the CAMERA lies smashed and broken on the CHASM floor ... a thin, shiny, thread of black FILM trailing from the smashed CAMERA body like spilt innards. DENHAM reaches out and touches the EXPOSED FILM ... his dreams DESTROYED. WIDE ON: THE FLARE SLOWLY DIES. CLOSE ON: JACK cradling JIMMY in his ARMS. HE LOOKS UP as he SEES the INSECTS CRAWL BACK. ANGLE ON: a HUGE six-foot CARNIVOROUS MAGGOT-THING squirms out! It crawls blindly towards LUMPY and CHOY! ANGLE ON: LUMPY pulling CHOY'S BODY to safety, but both are ATTACKED by LARGE INSECTS, the size of dogs! JACK tries to PULL THE GIANT CRAB-SPIDER OFF LUMPY, but instead it TURNS on him! More GIANT CRAB-SPIDERS JUMP at JACK. LUMPY and CHOY are CONSUMED by the nightmarish BUGS. ANGLE ON: DENHAM is WIELDING a short stick like a CLUB ... he smashes the HUGE BUGS in a psychotic explosion of RAGE, pulverizing their bodies into the DIRT! All around, MONSTROSITIES OF NATURE emerge from DANK BURROWS and crawl towards the JACK, DENHAM and JIMMY ... these are HUGE INSECTILE MUTANTS - combinations of SPIDERS, CRABS, MANTISES and CENTIPEDES! SUDDENLY JIMMY notices the TOMMY GUN sticking out of JACK'S PACK. GRABBING IT he aims at the INSECTS on JACK. BAM! BAM! BAM! The GIANT INSECTS are blown apart! JACK looks wildly around for DENHAM. THEY SEE that they're SURROUNDED BY SPIDERS. ANGLE ON: JACK desperately swings at the INSECTS with a STICK, whacking and stabbing them. BAM! BAM! BAM! GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SPIDERS SWARM out of HOLES in the CLIFF AND DIE. JACK spins around ... confused. ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN and a COUPLE of SAILORS OPEN FIRE from the LIP of the CHASM, SHOOTING the SPIDERS into SMITHEREENS! ANGLE ON: BRUCE SWINGS down from above, clinging to a VINE ... GUN BLAZING! BRUCE proceeds to lay waste to the INSECTS ... those not blasted apart, scurrying away, back in to the darkness.
S: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
N: Moving purposefully along a well-known route to his LAIR, KONG launches himself across a LOW CHASM ... one hand reaching out to clutch at THICK VINES on the other side ... SUDDENLY! The THICK VINES TEAR AWAY from the side of the CHASM WALL ... KONG falls backwards. ANN still clutched protectively to his CHEST he lands with a THUD! ANN looks up alarmed! KONG scrambles to his feet, GROWLING ... he places ANN on the GROUND pushing her protectively behind him. KONG POV: LOOMING out of the CHASM WALL is a HUGE FACE! CLOSE ON: ANN as her expression suddenly changes from FEAR to DAWNING COMPREHENSION. ANN walks past KONG ... who emits another LOW, WARNING GROWL.
C: ANN
D: It's alright ... it's okay ...
N: ANN reaches the WALL and begins to pull away more of the VINES and CREEPERS to reveal ... A life-size and very life-like eroded STATUE of a SITTING GIANT GORILLA ... the IMAGE of KONG ... ANN turns back excitedly to KONG, trying to make him understand. ANN (cont'd) Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ... you. "Kong". This is you. KONG looks from ANN to the HUGE STATUE ... KONG POV: ANN is dwarfed by the STONE MONOLITH. PUSH IN on KONG ... a growing sense of REALISATION as he comes to understand the STATUE is in fact a reflection of himself. CLOSE ON: KONG looking down at his hands ... it's as if he is seeing his GNARLED, LEATHERY FINGERS for the first time. ANN moves towards KONG ... he looks at her ... there is a VULNERABLE EXPRESSION on his FACE ... FEAR and SADNESS well in his EYES.
S: EXT. SKULL MOUNTAIN - DUSK
N: In VERTIGO-INDUCING shots, KONG climbs HIGHER and HIGHER - up into the HIGHEST PEAK of SKULL ISLAND ... carefully cradling ANN in his hand. A sudden FLAP OF WINGS and FLICKERING SHADOW causes KONG to pull ANN close to his chest as a sinister BAT-TYPE CREATURE lunges at her ... these SCAVENGERS hover in the SKIES around SKULL MOUNTAIN ... they have eight-foot wing spans and TALONED FEET. Their faces are more reptile than bat.
S: EXT. KONG'S LAIR - DUSK
N: WIDE ON: KONG steps out of a LARGE ROUND CAVE onto a LEDGE that juts out high over SKULL ISLAND ... This is KONG'S LAIR ... Over the ledge is a DIZZYING DROP of at least 1000-feet down to the JUNGLE. The "VENTURE" can be seen - moored off the TIP of the ISLAND, some three miles away. NGLE ON: KONG gently places ANN on the GROUND ... ANN watches as he moves away and sits to one side of the LEDGE. The SKY is a FIERY ORANGE as the SUN goes down ... SILHOUETTING the FIGURE of KONG ... CLOSE ON: ANN looks around the CAVE taking in her STRANGE SURROUNDINGS ... her eyes fall upon a HUGE GORILLA SKULL and SKELETON which lie within the recesses of the CAVE ... ANN turns and looks back at KONG ... realizing these are the BONES of his FOREBEARS ... that KONG was not always alone. SUDDEN flutter in the DARK recesses of the LAIR, a SINISTER SOUND, sends ANN scurrying towards KONG ... ONG won't look at her. ANN breaks into a few tap steps ... NO RESPONSE. She leans down and picks up some STONES ... JUGGLING them, attempting to amuse him as she did before. KONG's gaze remains averted ... He looks out over the JUNGLE CANOPY. ANN follows his GAZE, taking in the RUGGED LANDSCAPE which is bathed in the last EVENING RAYS of the SUN. She stares out to sea, a RAIN CLOUD casts shadows over the OCEAN.
C: ANN
D: It's beautiful.
E: softly
N: KONG sits QUIETLY staring out over the JUNGLE ... she looks up at him. ANN (cont'd) Beautiful. ANN places her HAND against her heart. ANN (cont'd) Beau-ti-ful. KONG'S BIG PAW unfurls beside ANN ... she hesitates for a moment, then CLIMBS into it. ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ... WIDE ON: KONG with ANN, high above the JUNGLE, as the last of the

C: DENHAM
D: Thank God.
C: ENGLEHORN
D: Don't thank God, thank Mr. Baxter ...
N: CLOSE ON: BRUCE PULLING HIMSELF UP THE ROPE, gasping from exertion. ENGLEHORN (cont'd) He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I knew you'd be okay ... CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up to see ENGLEHORN standing at the top of the CHASM. ENGLEHORN is watching him IMPASSIVELY. ENGLEHORN (cont'd) That's the thing about cockroaches; no matter how many times you flush them down the toilet they always crawl back up the bowl! ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he rises to his feet.
C: DENHAM
D: ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl! I'm drying off my wings and trekking across the lid!
N: ENGLEHORN LOOKS at DENHAM a BEAT and then LOOKS across the CHASM in SURPRISE. DENHAM FOLLOWS HIS GAZE. WIDE ON: JACK at the TOP of the opposite side of the CHASM ... a solitary figure, bloodied and torn.
C: ENGLEHORN
D: Driscoll ... don't be a fool! Give it up, it's useless ... She's dead.
C: DENHAM
D: She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her back.
E: quietly
N: ENGLEHORN turns to DENHAM. DENHAM (cont'd) And the ape will be hard on his heels. We can still come out of this thing okay - (pause) More than okay. Think about it, you've got a boat full of chloroform we can put to good use. ENGLEHORN looks at DENHAM for a BEAT and then LAUGHS.
C: ENGLEHORN
D: You want to trap the Ape? I don't think so.
C: DENHAM
D: Isn't that what you do? Live animal capture? I heard you were the best.
N: ENGLEHORN stares at DENHAM for a moment, it is impossible to know what he is thinking. DENHAM (cont'd) Jack! JACK looks at DENHAM D ... DENHAM raises a hand in salute. DENHAM (cont'd) (calling) Look after yourself!
C: JACK
D: Keep the Gate open.
C: DENHAM
D: Sure thing, buddy! Good luck!
N: ANGLE ON: JACK turns to go ... and disappears up the DARK TUNNEL. DENHAM (cont'd) I'm sorry.

S: EXT. KONG'S LAIR - NIGHT
N: ANGLE ON: JACK is climbing up through ROCKS towards KONG'S LAIR! BAT-THINGS flutter ... AGITATED ... SENSING an INTRUDER. CLOSE ON: JACK freezes. NGLE ON: A LARGE NUMBER of BAT-THINGS are GATHERING amid the STALACTITES that hang from the ROOF of the CAVERN. He scans the LAIR for any sign of ANN ... but can't see her. The OLD BONES of a LARGE GORILLA lie across the CAVE from JACK. ACK CLIMBS higher INTO THE CAVE until at last he's on THE LEDGE WITH KONG. ANGLE ON: JACK moves forward, towards KONG.
