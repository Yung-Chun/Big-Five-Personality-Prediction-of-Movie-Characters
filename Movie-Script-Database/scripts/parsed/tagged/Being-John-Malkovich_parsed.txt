M: A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman
S: INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY
N: The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled "Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs. He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die." He opens it up. "die die die die die..." A rooster crows.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest, crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.
C: LOTTE
D: Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his pen. Good morning.
N: Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.
C: CRAIG
D: Morning.
C: LOTTE
D: Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
C: CRAIG
D: Enjoy.
C: LOTTE
D: Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
C: CRAIG
D: We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
C: LOTTE
D: Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
C: CRAIG
D: The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
E: bitterly
C: LOTTE
D: Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
E: sighs beat
C: CRAIG
D: What?
C: LOTTE
D: Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
C: CRAIG
D: Which one is Elijah again?
C: LOTTE
D: The monkey.
C: CRAIG
D: Yeah. Okay.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING
N: The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers. A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage. The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig, above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet. His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on the real Craigs brow. His fingers move like lightning. The puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower. The assembled crowd is enthralled.
C: TV ANNOUNCER
D: The crowd is enthralled as Derek Mantini, arguably the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world, performs "The Belle of Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily Dickinson puppet, directed by the inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.
N: Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.
C: CHARLES NELSON REILLY
D: Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.
C: CRAIG
D: Gimmicky bastard.
N: Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs his chin in thought, then stands with great determination. MUSIC IN: TRIUMPHANT

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
N: Craig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the want ads. He sees an ad for a company called "WOMYN-TEERS", looking for "an African-American, Lesbian Separatist Puppeteer for Community Outreach." Craig rubs his chin in thought, stands with determination. MUSIC IN: SAME AS BEFORE.

T: CUT TO:

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: Craig sits in the passenger seat. He is made up as a woman and wears a full-body rubber "naked woman" suit. Lotte drives.

E: finally
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Craig sees a personal ad: "Male puppeteer looking for attractive female puppeteer for friendship, travel, and much much more." Craig rubs his chin, then thinks better of it and sighs. He finds a want ad calling for a "short-statured file clerk with unusually nimble and dexterous fingers needed for speed filing." Craig writes down the address.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
N: Craig. in sport coat and tie, studies the business listings board. He finds LesterCorp, and sees that it is located on floor 7 1/2. Craig presses the elevator button and waits. Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open, and Craig and the other man get in.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
N: The other man presses "9." Craig studies the buttons. There is no "7 1/2." WOMAN #1 Seven and a half, right?
C: CRAIG
D: Uh. yeah.
N: WOMAN #1 I'll take you through it. The man picks up a crowbar leaning in the corner. He watches the floor numbers light up in succession. After "7" and before "8", the man hits the emergency stop button. The elevator slams to a halt. The man pries open the doors with the crowbar. Revealed is a standard office building hallway, except that from floor to ceiling it is only about four feet high. Everything is scaled down accordingly. The number on the wall across from the elevator is 7 1/2. WOMAN #1 Seven and a half.
C: CRAIG
D: Thank you.
N: Craig climbs out onto the 7 1/2 floor.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SEVEN AND A HALF FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Craig, hunched-over, makes his way down the hallway looking for LesterCorp. He passes a hunched-over man walking in the other direction. They nod to each other. Craig finds a door marked "LesterCorp - Meeting America's Filing Needs Since 1922." He enters.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LESTERCORP RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS
N: All furniture is scaled down to fit into this low-ceilinged space. A few other short men sit reading tiny magazines. Craig approaches Floris, the receptionist.
C: FLORIS
D: Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
C: CRAIG
D: No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
C: FLORIS
D: Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
C: CRAIG
D: Schwartz.
C: FLORIS
D: Pardon?
C: CRAIG
D: Schwartz.
C: FLORIS
D: I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
C: CRAIG
D: My name is Schwartz.
C: FLORIS
D: Money, Miss Warts?
C: CRAIG
D: Forget it.
N: Craig takes a seat next to the other applicants.
C: FLORIS
D: Fork ah did?
E: calling across the room
N: The intercom buzzes. Floris picks it up.
C: FLORIS
D: Mr. Juarez?
E: to Craig
C: CRAIG
D: Yes?
C: FLORIS
D: Yex?
C: CRAIG
D: I said "yes."
C: FLORIS
D: You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
N: Craig stands, opens Lester's door, and enters.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Craig enters. Lester, a giant of an old man, sits hunched behind his tiny desk.
C: LESTER
D: Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
C: CRAIG
D: Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
E: extending his hand
N: Lester flips an intercom switch.
C: LESTER
D: Security.
C: CRAIG
D: No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
C: LESTER
D: She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youre implying.
C: CRAIG
D: Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
C: LESTER
D: Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
C: CRAIG
D: Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
C: LESTER
D: You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
E: crafty
C: CRAIG
D: Glooph is not a letter, sir.
C: LESTER
D: Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
N: Lester hands Craig a bunch of index cards. Craig orders them with amazing speed and dexterity. Lester watches, eyes wide.
C: LESTER
D: Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
E: CONT'D flips intercom switch

D: Gehginnis ondah foam?
E: O.S.
C: LESTER
D: Forget it.
C: FLORIS
D: Fork ah did?
E: CONT'D
C: LESTER
D: Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
E: flips off switch
C: CRAIG
D: You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
C: LESTER
D: Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
C: CRAIG
D: No.
C: LESTER
D: Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
E: beat
C: CRAIG
D: No. I understand perfectly.
C: LESTER
D: Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
E: choking up
C: CRAIG
D: Just one. Why is this floor so short?
C: LESTER
D: Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
E: laughs heartily
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ORIENTATION ROOM - DAY
N: It's a small screening room with red velvet seats. There are a few people scattered about the squat theater. Craig is among them. He looks around the room and his eyes rest momentarily on Maxine. She is in her late 20's with close cropped black hair. Her eyes are opaque, her face expressionless, her countenance trance-like. She glances over at Craig, then turns back to the screen. The lights dim. A projector whirs and the screen is illuminated.

C: WENDY
D: Hello, Don.
C: DON
D: Hello. Wendy.
C: WENDY
D: Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
C: DON
D: It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
T: CUT TO:
N: OLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING.
C: DON
D: He would call this building the Mertin-Flemmer Building, after himself and someone else, who, local legend has it, was named Flemmer.

S: INT. 19TH CENTURY OFFICE - DAY
N: An actor playing Mertin sits at a desk and writes with aquill. He appears very stern and has mutton chop sideburns.
C: DON
D: One day. Captain Mertin received an unexpected visitor.
E: CONT'D V.0.
N: There is a knock at the door.
C: MERTIN
D: Enter ye, if ye dare enter.
N: A tiny woman enters.
C: TINY WOMAN
D: Captain Mertin?
C: MERTIN
D: What want ye, girl child?
C: TINY WOMAN
D: I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
C: MERTIN
D: I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
E: taken aback
C: TINY WOMAN
D: I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
C: MERTIN
D: Aye. Speak then if ye must.
E: sighs
C: TINY WOMAN
D: Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
N: Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.
C: MERTIN
D: Woman, your story moves me like n other. Me own sister was tiny and then died. Therefore, I shall make ye me wife. And I shall build a floor in my building, between the 7th and 8th, which will be scaled down, so from now on there shall be at least one place on God's green Earth that you and your accursed kind can live in peace...

N: Don And Wendy crouch and talk.
C: DON
D: So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
C: WENDY
D: Ha ha ha!

N: The screen goes dark. The lights go up. Craig looks over at Maxine. She stands and walks past him.
C: CRAIG
D: Moving story.
C: MAXINE
D: Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
C: CRAIG
D: Is that true?
C: MAXINE
D: Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
C: CRAIG
D: Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.

C: CRAIG
D: We have to make it an early night.

D: They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
C: CRAIG
D: Hmmm.
E: not paying attention
C: LOTTE
D: Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?

D: Thank you, Floris.
E: over-enunciating
N: Floris shrugs, shakes her head.
C: FLORIS
D: You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.

D: And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.

N: Craig is at his workbench, painting the finishing touches on a new puppet. It is beautiful. It is Maxine. Lotte watches quietly from the door. A Lotte puppet hangs from a hook, tangled and dusty.

D: New puppet?
N: Craig is surprised, caught.
C: CRAIG
D: Yeah, just an idea I had.

D: She's very beautiful.

E: quietly
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FILE ROOM - MORNING
N: Craig files. Floris watches him from the doorway. Dr. Lester watches Floris from behind a cabinet.
C: FLORIS
D: Oh, what magic those fingers could work on the right cabinet. Alphabetize me, baby. And don't forget, I comes before U.
E: strokes Craig's neck
N: Floris laughs long and hard. Too long and too hard.
C: CRAIG
D: Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
C: FLORIS
D: I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
E: upset
N: Floris runs from the room. Lester pokes his head out from behind the cabinet.
C: LESTER
D: Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
C: CRAIG
D: I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
C: LESTER
D: One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
E: beat
C: CRAIG
D: I'll keep that in mind, sir.
C: LESTER
D: No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
C: CRAIG
D: The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
C: LESTER
D: I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
C: CRAIG
D: Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
C: LESTER
D: All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
N: Lester exits.
C: CRAIG
D: Shit.

S: INT. HALLWAY 7 1/2 FLOOR - DAY
N: Craig squats next to a payphone.
C: CRAIG
D: I won't be late. I just have to listen to Lester's sexual fantasies and drink carrot juice for a little while. It's a job thing.
E: into phone

C: CRAIG
D: That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
C: MAXINE
D: Somebody told you.
C: CRAIG
D: Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!

C: LESTER
D: Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
C: CRAIG
D: Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
E: standing

D: Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
C: CRAIG
D: Yessir.
C: LESTER
D: Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
E: afterthought
C: CRAIG
D: That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
E: checking watch
N: Craig hurries to the door. Lester downs Craig's juice, signals the waiter for more.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE STUCK PIG - NIGHT
N: Maxine sits at the bar, watching her watch. Craig rushes into the room, frantic, out of breath. He spots Maxine and plops himself next to her.

C: MAXINE
D: Just.
C: CRAIG
D: Buy you a drink, Maxine?
C: MAXINE

C: MAXINE
D: Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
N: The drinks arrive. Maxine's is in an enormous fishbowl of a glass. It's bright blue, with fruit and marshmallows swimming in it. Paper umbrellas stick out of it, an plastic monkeys hang from the rim.
C: CRAIG
D: That's the usual?
C: MAXINE
D: Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
N: Maxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the empty glass to the bartender.
C: MAXINE
D: Set me up again, Barry.
E: CONT'D
N: The bartender walks away with the empty glass.
C: CRAIG
D: Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
C: MAXINE
D: You're a fag or a liar.
C: CRAIG
D: I mean, I am really attracted to you.
E: backpedaling
C: MAXINE
D: I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.

E: nervous, talking too much
N: There is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah. Finally:

C: CRAIG
D: Tell me, Craig, why do you love puppeteering? Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly. Perhaps it's the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin. Moving differently, thinking differently, feeling differently. Interesting. Would you like to be inside my skin, Craig? Think what I think? Feel what I feel? More than anything. Maxine. It's good in here, Craig. Better than your wildest dreams.
E: as Maxine, fascinated as Craig as Maxine as Craig as Maxine

N: Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across it.
C: CRAIG
D: Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 floor.

C: CRAIG
D: There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
C: MAXINE
D: Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
C: CRAIG
D: He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
C: MAXINE
D: What's he been in?
C: CRAIG
D: Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
C: MAXINE
D: Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
C: CRAIG
D: Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

D: More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
C: CRAIG
D: No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
C: LESTER
D: I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
C: CRAIG
D: No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
C: LESTER
D: And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.

N: Malkovich's POV. It's a busy Italian restaurant. Malkovich looks around, checks his watch: 8:03. A guy walks up to him.
C: GUY
D: Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?
C: MALKOVICH
D: Yes.
C: GUY
D: Wow. You were really great in that movie where you played that retard.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Thank you very much.
C: GUY
D: I just wanted to tell you that. And say thank you. I have a cousin that's a retard, so, as you can imagine, it means a lot to me to see retards portrayed on the silver screen so compassionately.
N: The guy walks away. Malkovich scans the room. Maxine enters the restaurant. We see her, but Malkovich doesn't single her out of the crowd. She looks around.
C: LOTTE
D: Maxine!
E: V.O.
N: Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.
C: MAXINE
D: Hi. I'm so glad you decided to come. I'm Maxine.
N: Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes her hand.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I'm John. I didn't think I was going to come, but I felt oddly compelled. I have to admit I was a bit intrigued by your voice.
C: LOTTE
D: God, she's beautiful. The way she's looking at me. At him. At us.
E: V.O.
C: MAXINE
D: And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
C: LOTTE
D: I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
E: V.O.

D: Whatever you're having.

N: Craig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the window.
C: CRAIG
D: So how was it? What was he doing?
C: LOTTE
D: Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
C: CRAIG
D: You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
C: LOTTE
D: You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
C: CRAIG
D: I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
C: LOTTE
D: It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away.
E: dreamily
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating lasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an awkward silence.
C: LOTTE
D: Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
E: to Maxine
C: CRAIG
D: After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
C: MAXINE
D: Ah.
C: LOTTE
D: After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy.
E: whispers
N: There is another silence.
C: MAXINE
D: The way I see it, the world is divide into those go after what they want and those who don't. The passionate ones, the ones who go after what they want, may not get what they want, but they remain vital, in touch with themselves, and when they lie on their deathbeds, they have few regrets. The ones who don't go after what they want... well, who gives a shit about them anyway?
E: to no one in particular
N: Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and start kissing her passionately about the face and neck. They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.
C: CRAIG
D: You?
N: Lotte looks away.
C: MAXINE
D: Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
C: CRAIG
D: My God.
E: disgusted
N: Lotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the table.
C: MAXINE
D: Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. Thanks for a wonderful dinner. No hard feelings, partner.

E: a little too urgently
N: Erroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly.
C: ERROLL
D: Hello, I'm here about the ad.
C: CRAIG
D: Please, have a seat.
N: Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He glances nervously over at Maxine.
C: ERROLL
D: When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
C: CRAIG
D: Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
C: ERROLL
D: Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
C: MAXINE
D: No.
C: ERROLL
D: Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
C: MAXINE

C: ERROLL
D: Can I be anyone I want?
C: MAXINE
D: You can be John Malkovich.
C: ERROLL
D: Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!

C: CRAIG
D: Tell your friends.
E: gasping for air

E: nods to Maxine
C: CRAIG
D: Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
C: LESTER
D: There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
C: CRAIG
D: You're insane.
C: LESTER
D: I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.

And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

D: You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Let me try!
C: MAXINE
D: Let him try.
C: CRAIG
D: Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
N: Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Jesus.
E: repulsed by the slime
N: Malkovich climbs in. The door closes.
C: CRAIG
D: What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
C: MAXINE
D: How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
E: shrugs
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MEMBRANOUS TUNNEL - DAY
N: Malkovich crawls through. It's murky. He's tense. Suddenly there is a slurping sound.
T: CUT TO:
N: PSYCHEDELIC MONTAGE We see Malkovich hurtling through different environments. It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet clown paintings.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes. Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the table looks at him seductively, winks and talks.
C: GIRL MALKOVICH
D: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich...
N: Malkovich looks confused. The Malkovich waiter approaches, pen and pad in hand, ready to take their orders.
C: WAITER MALKOVICH
D: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich?
C: GIRL MALKOVICH
D: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich.
C: WAITER MALKOVICH
D: Malkovich Malkovich. Malkovich?
E: Turning to Malkovich
N: Malkovich looks down at the menu. Every item is "Malkovich." He screams:
C: MALKOVICH
D: Malkovich!
N: The waiter jots it down on his pad.
C: WAITER MALKOVICH
D: Malkovich.
N: Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a '40's style big band of Malkoviches.
C: SINGING MALKOVICH
D: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich...
N: Malkovich flies through the back door.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DITCH - DAY
N: Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is huddled and shivering and soaking wet.
C: CRAIG
D: So how was it?
C: MALKOVICH
D: That... was... no... simulation.
C: CRAIG
D: I know. I'm sorry...
C: MALKOVICH
D: I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
C: CRAIG
D: Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
C: MALKOVICH
D: This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
C: CRAIG
D: With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
C: MALKOVICH
D: It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
N: Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike.
C: CRAIG
D: And who's to say I won't be seeing what you're seeing... in court?
E: calling after him
N: Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.
C: MOTORIST
D: Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!
N: Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car and hits him on the head.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She looks haggard.
C: LOTTE
D: Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
C: CRAIG
D: Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
C: LOTTE
D: You fell in love with her first.
C: CRAIG
D: Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
C: LOTTE
D: You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
C: CRAIG
D: That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
E: beat
C: LOTTE
D: Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
C: CRAIG
D: Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
C: LOTTE
D: I need a shower.
C: CRAIG
D: I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
C: LOTTE
D: You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
C: CRAIG
D: I love you so much.
N: She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear.
C: CRAIG
D: But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
E: CONT'D
C: MAXINE
D: J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
E: O.S.
C: LOTTE
D: We have to meet.
C: MAXINE
D: One hour.
N: Craig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth.
C: CRAIG
D: I'll tell you all about it when I get home.
N: Craig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands Elijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly watches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow. Something is going on in his brain. We move slowly into his eyes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
N: It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa." The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie them up. The safari men laugh.
C: SAFARI MAN
D: Well, there monkeys ain't going nowhere. Let's get us a couple a brews 'fore the boss comes back...
N: The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.
C: CHIMP ONE
D: Son, untie your mother and me! Quickly! Before the great bald chimp-men return.
E: DUBBED VOICE
N: A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two speaks.
C: CHIMP TWO
D: Hurry, Elijah!
E: DUBBED VOICE
C: SAFARI MAN
D: Why you little bastard!
N: Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the ropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He works furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her mouth.
C: LOTTE
D: Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!
N: Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks the cage, and dials the phone.
C: LOTTE
D: Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
C: MAXINE
D: Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
E: O.S. beat, calmly
C: LOTTE
D: But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
C: MAXINE
D: I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
E: O.S.
N: Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.
C: LOTTE
D: Hello, Dr. Lester?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands there, dressed in an evening gown.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Come on in.
C: MAXINE
D: I can explain about the portal, darling.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
C: MAXINE
D: Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in there?
E: beat
N: Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward, puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be against him will.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Yes. How did you know it was me?
C: MAXINE
D: Lotte called me.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Oh, so the bitch escaped.
C: MAXINE
D: Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I'm getting better all the time.
C: MAXINE
D: I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
C: MALKOVICH
D: No... damn... you... Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
E: as Malkovich as Craig
N: Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig) laughs wildly.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi desk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and hollow-eyed.
C: LESTER
D: You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
C: LOTTE
D: Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
C: LESTER
D: Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
C: LOTTE
D: No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
C: LESTER
D: What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
E: slaps Lotte furiously
C: LOTTE
D: No, I didn't know that.
C: LESTER
D: Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
C: LOTTE
D: No.
C: LESTER
D: Oh, sorry. Right this way.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Lotte site next to Lester in the darkened auditorium. The projector whirs. The screen lights up. TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.
C: LESTER ON FILM
D: Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians. As you may already know, today a baby was born into this sad world.
N: We see a shot of a newborn.
C: LESTER ON FILM
D: His name is John Horatio Hannibal Malkovich. And we are the keepers of the door to his soul. One day, when his brain is big enough, we will all journey into his head and live there for all eternity. Following the teachings of our leader Karl Marx, we will build the ultimate communist community, one body and hundreds, maybe thousands, of brains inside working together to form a super human intellect capable of curing disease, stopping all war, and ruling the world with a benevolent fist. We will take a wife, a woman of uncommon beauty and intellect, who is, as yet, still an infant herself.
E: CONT'D
N: We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in her hair.
C: LESTER ON FILM
D: Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella DeMent.
E: CONT'D
C: LOTTE
D: Does Floris know that she's the chosen?
C: LESTER
D: Well, I tried to explain it to her, but...
N: Lester points to his ear and shrugs.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite relaxed.
C: MAXINE
D: You still there, sweets?
C: MALKOVICH
D: Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
C: MAXINE
D: Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
E: little girl pout
C: MALKOVICH
D: You mean with Malkovich?
C: MAXINE
D: I'd love to see your work.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Really? Yeah. Okay.
E: pleased
N: Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I'll do something I call "Craig's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."
E: CONT'D
N: Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same, complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow. He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.
C: MAXINE
D: That was incredible. You're brilliant!
E: moved
C: MALKOVICH
D: You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
C: MAXINE
D: You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
N: Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.
C: MAXINE
D: Stay in him forever?
C: MALKOVICH
D: No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
E: as Malkovich, screaming as Craig, calmly
C: MAXINE
D: Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
C: MALKOVICH
D: No! Please! Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
E: as Malkovich, breaking through as Craig, to Malkovich to Maxine
C: MAXINE
D: No one would ever have to know its not him.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
E: an idea
C: MAXINE
D: Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - NIGHT
N: The worshippers are assembled. Lotte stands before them.
C: LOTTE
D: I have sinned, unwittingly, against the community. And for this I am truly sorry.
N: MAN #2 W-w-what's it like on the inside?
C: LOTTE
D: Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.
N: MAN #2 Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say it's time.
C: LESTER
D: Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're all prepared, and perhaps this Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand a bit. We will enter the portal tonight!
N: Everyone cheers.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal with cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
E: Craig to Malkovich to Maxine
C: MAXINE
D: It's okay, my sweet.
E: kissing him
N: They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.
C: LESTER
D: Aaaahhhh, the portal!
C: LOTTE
D: You bastard!
E: to Malkovich
N: Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds her back.
C: LESTER
D: No! Don't harm the vessel!
C: LOTTE
D: It's Craig in there, I can tell.
C: LESTER
D: I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
E: to Malkovich
C: CRAIG
D: Squatter's rights, Lester.
N: Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances triumphantly over at Lotte.
C: MAXINE
D: Now excuse us, we have an entertainment legend to create.
C: LESTER
D: Clear the way for them, my friends. They will be dealt with in due time.
E: to the cult members
N: The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine exit.
C: LESTER
D: Now, let's see what we can do to salvage this portal... for the sake of all that is good.
E: CONT'D
N: The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement. Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and skin on the rough gray surface.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY
N: A slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone.
C: AGENT
D: Of course, send him right in. Don't ever keep him waiting again. Do you understand?
N: Malkovich and Maxine enter. The agent stands, holds out his hand.
C: AGENT
D: John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
E: CONT'D
C: MALKOVICH
D: This is my fiancee Maxine.
N: The agent shakes Maxine's hand.
C: AGENT
D: Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about the cunt at reception. Please have a seat.
N: Malkovich and Maxine sit.
C: AGENT
D: Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?
E: CONT'D
C: MAXINE
D: No thanks.
C: AGENT
D: Teresa, get me a chicken soup. Chicken soup?
E: into phone to Malkovich and Maxine
N: Maxine and Malkovich shake their heads "no."
C: MALKOVICH
D: I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
C: AGENT
D: Okay.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
C: AGENT
D: Oh yeah, he's good.
E: no clue
C: MALKOVICH
D: ... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
C: MAXINE
D: Vegas.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Vegas. Can you arrange that?
C: AGENT
D: Sure, sure. Just let me make a couple of calls.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The cult members are still there, now with picks shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2 emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist. MAN #2 That's the last of it, boss. Lester peers through the door.
C: LESTER
D: Well, let's see what we've got here.
N: Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS
N: Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a flash of light.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BUNKER - DAY
N: The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping. There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester views the scene through somebody's POV.
C: LESTER
D: My God, where am I? This seems so familiar.
E: V.O.
N: The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.
C: LESTER
D: My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker! Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!
E: V.O.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Cut!
N: We look over to see a director and camera crew.
C: LESTER
D: Oh, I'm just the actor in that Twilight Zone episode.
E: V.O.
N: There is a popping sound.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DITCH - DAY
N: Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly shakes his head "no."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY
N: The cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting. Lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at the ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.
C: LESTER
D: Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
C: LOTTE
D: Why not? I need to get in there!
E: panicky
C: LESTER
D: I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
C: LOTTE
D: That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
C: LESTER
D: I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
N: MAN #3 (raises hand) Oooh, I got an idea! What if we build another portal to Malkovich, like around back, and sneak in that way? MAN #4 Only Captain Mertin knew how to build a portal, dummy, and he's dead!
C: LESTER
D: Actually, my friends, I suppose its time I told you, I'm Captain James Mertin.
N: The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on a board. He then rearranges them for a while.
C: LESTER
D: You see, Lester is an anagram for Mertin.
E: CONT'D
N: Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little tense now.
C: LESTER
D: It used to work, I'm sure of it.
E: CONT'D
N: Several members check their watches.
C: LESTER
D: Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.
E: CONT'D
N: L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns from the board to face the congregation. MAN #3 How can this be? I thought you were only one hundred and five years old. Mertin would have to be...
C: LESTER
D: I'm two hundred and five, truth be told.
E: chuckles amiably
N: WOMAN #1 (flirtatiously) You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
C: LESTER
D: Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
N: There is a lot of murmuring in the room now. MAN #2 So what exactly are you saying? Are we in cahoots with the Dark Master here?
C: LESTER
D: Surprise.
N: The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.
C: LESTER
D: Wait! It's not that bad! When we get into Malkovich, we still get to rule the world, just like I told you. The only difference is that we rule in the name of evil, instead of good.
E: CONT'D
N: People stop in their tracks. MAN #3 That's the only difference?
C: LESTER
D: Absolutely.
N: The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.
C: LESTER
D: So anyway...
E: CONT'D
N: Lotte stands.
C: LOTTE
D: Well, I for one, am resigning. I will not serve evil. I am ashamed of all of you.
N: Lotte heads for the door.
C: LESTER
D: My dear, let me assure you that when we attain power, it will be much more pleasant for those inside Malkovich, than for those outside.
N: Lotte stops and turns.
C: LOTTE
D: I'll take my chances.
N: She exits.
C: LESTER
D: Anybody else?
N: WOMAN #1 Do we get to wear a crown?
C: LESTER
D: But of course.
N: WOMAN #1 Count me in.
C: LESTER
D: Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
N: FLIP TO:
S: INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER
N: Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch him.
C: FLEMMER
D: Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
C: LESTER
D: And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
C: FLEMMER
D: Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
C: LESTER
D: Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
C: FLEMMER
D: Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you? Nice to meet you all.
E: to cultists
N: The cult members ad-lib "same here, sir."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly sobbing. The caged animals watch her.
C: LOTTE
D: Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're not human. People are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. I've lost my heart to two of them and I almost lost my soul to another. And I'm no better. Look at the way I keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. Well, I've been in a cage too, my friends. Literally and figuratively. So tonight I set you free.
N: Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until she is alone.
C: LOTTE
D: Good-bye, friends.
E: CONT'D
N: A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still there and holding her hand. She smiles.
C: LOTTE
D: Hello, friend
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
N: We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted street, dispersing into the night. A lone dark figure turns the corner, and walks slowly up the street to Craig and Lotte's building.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps. The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.
C: LOTTE
D: They've come to kill me, Elijah. See, I know too much. I should get the door. It's impolite to keep death waiting.
N: Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes. Then he leads her by the hand out the window.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT
N: The marquee reads: World's Greatest Puppeteer Craig Schwartz and his Magical Puppet John Malkovich.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Malkovich sits in a tuxedo and watches himself in the dressing table mirror. Maxine, in a tight black number, reclines on the couch.
C: MAXINE
D: This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
N: Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.
C: MAXINE
D: Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
C: MALKOVICH
D: He's a selfish bastard.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT
N: The house is filling with formally dressed audience members. The cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among them. The lights go down.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Ladies and gentlemen, it is the great privilege of the Luxor hotel and Casino to present Craig Schwartz and his magical puppet John Malkovich.
E: O.S.
N: The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.
C: LESTER
D: Blasphemous bastard.
N: Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."
C: LESTER
D: Pretty good though.
E: CONT'D grudgingly
N: Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today Goodbye." in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at him.
C: USHER
D: Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid there's not an empty seat in the entire house.
C: MANTINI
D: Make one empty.
E: not taking his eyes from the stage
C: USHER
D: Y-y-y-es sir.
N: The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot. Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The Waterfront." He alternates between the Marlon Brando part and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.
C: LESTER
D: Not too shabby.
N: Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and juggling chainsaws.
C: MANTINI
D: Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.
N: At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the cultists get up.

S: INT. SEWER - NIGHT
N: Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up against the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying supplies: food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket and sits down next to her.
C: LOTTE
D: They're going to take over the world, Elijah. Evil will reign. But, then, evil already reigns, doesn't it? So what difference does it make if John Malkovich is wearing the fucking crown while it's reigning?
N: Elijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is returning.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: It's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment. Looks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls are lined with books. Mr. Flemmer sits at his desk, his head in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.
C: FLEMMER
D: It's open.
N: The door opens and Lester pokes his head in.
C: LESTER
D: It's just me, boss. I brought croissants.
N: Lester enters with a greasy white paper bag.
C: FLEMMER
D: Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
C: LESTER
D: We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
C: FLEMMER
D: Vegas? What'd you think?
E: impressed
C: LESTER
D: The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
C: FLEMMER
D: Impressions? Those are hard.
C: LESTER
D: Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
C: FLEMMER
D: I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
C: LESTER
D: A scary dream?
C: FLEMMER
D: No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
C: LESTER
D: I like that.
E: noncommittally

S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
N: Malkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is surrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking champagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing table, brushing her hair.
C: MALKOVICH
D: They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!" The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!" Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!" Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
C: MAXINE
D: Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Sleepy suddenly.
C: MAXINE
D: Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
N: But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HELL - NIGHT
N: Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened. He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister grin.
C: CRAIG
D: Who are you?
C: FLEMMER
D: I am the Devil.
C: CRAIG
D: Oh.
C: FLEMMER
D: Leave Malkovich. He is mine.
C: CRAIG
D: Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS
N: Malkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him.
C: MAXINE
D: Bad dream, darling?
C: MALKOVICH
D: I've got to leave Malkovich.
C: MAXINE
D: You've got to be kidding.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
N: Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased with himself.
C: MAXINE
D: Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can't back out because of some stupid dream.
C: FLEMMER
D: Shit.
E: to himself
C: MALKOVICH
D: Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
C: MAXINE
D: Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
E: laughs derisively
N: There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.
C: MAXINE
D: Yeah what?!
E: CONT'D
C: MALKOVICH
D: Derek Mantini!
N: Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and Maxine give each other the once over.
C: MANTINI
D: Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
E: still eyeing Maxine
C: MALKOVICH
D: Did you see the reviews?
C: MANTINI
D: Yeah, I saw them
C: MALKOVICH
D: Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
C: MAXINE
D: I'm Maxine. I produced the evening with Malkovich.
C: MANTINI
D: Very impressive. I could use a producer with your vision. And other outstanding attributes.
C: MALKOVICH
D: She's not available.
C: MANTINI
D: We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
C: MAXINE
D: Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
C: MANTINI
D: I won't waste your time Schwartz, or more importantly, mine. Here's my proposal: There's only room in this world for one "World's Greatest Puppeteer." Correct? So let's allow the puppet-going public to crown their king.
C: MALKOVICH
D: How do we do that?
C: MANTINI
D: A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
C: MALKOVICH
D: What's the play?
C: MANTINI
D: Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Never heard of it.
C: MANTINI
D: Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
C: MANTINI
D: Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
C: MANTINI
D: Great then.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Is there dancing?
C: MANTINI
D: No.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Who needs dancing?

S: INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Lester is watering Flemmer's plants. A key is heard in the door. Flemmer enters, a small carry-on bag slung over his shoulder.
C: LESTER
D: How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
C: FLEMMER
D: No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
E: beat
C: LESTER
D: What kind of circumstances?
C: FLEMMER
D: Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
C: LESTER
D: The Great Mantini?
C: FLEMMER
D: No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
C: LESTER
D: Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
C: FLEMMER
D: But I think I have another plan.
C: LESTER
D: Do tell. I love a good plan.
E: snippy
C: FLEMMER
D: Why are you being like this?
N: Lester shrugs.
C: LESTER
D: I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
C: FLEMMER
D: Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
C: LESTER
D: Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
C: FLEMMER
D: I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
C: LESTER
D: I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
C: FLEMMER
D: Fine. Let's drop it.
C: LESTER
D: Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
C: FLEMMER
D: Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
C: LESTER
D: Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.

S: INT. SEWER - NIGHT

C: ELIJAH
D: You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
E: SUBTITLES
C: LOTTE
D: I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
C: ELIJAH
D: It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
E: SUBTITLES
N: Lotte turns away, shaken. A tear rolls down her face.
C: LOTTE
D: What have I become?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT
N: The Marquee reads: Derek Mantini's sixty-foot Harry S. Truman puppet and Craig Schwartz's actual-size John Malkovich puppet in Peter Shaffer's "Equus."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BROADHURST THEATER - NIGHT
N: The house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S. Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.
C: HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
D: Do you dream often?
C: MALKOVICH
D: Do you?
C: HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
D: It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Says who?
C: HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
D: Says me. Do you dream often?
C: MALKOVICH
D: Do you?
N: We see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BROADHURST BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: The dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine.
C: MAXINE
D: Keep your eyes in your pants, old timer.
E: without turning around
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER
N: It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation. Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple: THEATERGOER #1 That Truman puppet is downright boring as the psychiatrist. THEATERGOER #2 It's a wooden performance, really. Get it? Wooden? Second couple: THEATERGOER #3 What's with the Malkovich puppet? He was much better in Vegas when he played the piano with his feet. THEATERGOER #4 I hate it when they try to stretch. It's like Woody Allen. Third couple: THEATERGOER #5 They both stink! I'm going across the street to second act Miss Saigon.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror. Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights up a cigarette.
C: MAXINE
D: You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, lover, 'cause right now you're running neck and neck with the dead president. And you're both in last place.
N: Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his head.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones.
C: CHARLES NELSON REILLY
D: You're doing beautifully, my boy. I wept at the speech about your wife.
N: Flemmer materializes behind Mantini
C: CHARLES NELSON REILLY
D: What the hell? Nyong-nyong!
N: Mantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break for it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in mid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he, too, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his pocket.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT
N: We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.
C: HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
D: I can hear the creature's voice. It's calling me out of the black cave of the Psyche. I shove in my dim little torch, and there he stands -- waiting for me. He raises his matted head. He opens his great, square teeth and says 'Why? ... Why me? ... Why -- ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really imagine you can account for Me? Totally, infallibly, inevitably account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'
E: mocking
N: Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and sees a silent, rapt crowd.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BROADHURST STAGE - A BIT LATER
N: Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm. During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising his ten foot eyebrows in surprise...

D: Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed! Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming! ... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!

N: A man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the street. She is dirty but determined.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL
N: Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking it. Truman speaks.
C: HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
D: Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ... Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back! Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ... Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ... In. Out .. In ... Out ...
N: Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.
C: AUDIENCE MEMBER
D: That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine actor.
E: to his wife
C: FLEMMER
D: Bastard is stealing my thunder.
E: blood boiling
N: Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing, swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he talks.
C: HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
D: All right! I'll take it away! He'll be delivered from madness. What then? He'll feel himself acceptable! What then?
N: Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog. Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when he talks, fire comes out of his mouth. HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D) I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll erase the welts cut into his body by flying manes. The audience "ooohs" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from "Swan Lake." The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech, now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and flying around the auditorium as he speaks. HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D) You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses will be quite safe. You'll save your pennies every week, till you can change that scooter into a car... The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned, in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "Mr. Bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S. Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just raised from the dead.
C: ACTUAL TRUMAN
D: Where am I? Aren't I dead? Vote for Mantini!
E: possessed
N: Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him. Thunderous applause is heard in the background.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Good-bye, Maxine.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground. Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war cry and runs out onto the stage.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks. Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the audience.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I am your earthly king! Kneel before me!
E: now sounding like fifty voices
N: The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to their knees.
C: CROWD
D: Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.
E: like automatons
N: Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back. Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the theater.

T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY
N: CHYRON: LATER THAT WEEK Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but everything is painted gray: the buildings, the streets, the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets, carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky. There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red, jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the street looks up.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Greetings, my lowly subjects.
E: fifty voices
C: FLORIS
D: Great things, my lonely subtext?
C: MALKOVICH
D: Boy, be careful what you wish for. Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride, will you?
E: rolls his eyes to Floris
N: Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.
C: MALKOVICH
D: I am bored. You will dance for your king now.
E: CONT'D to the people on the street
N: Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is void of expression. Malkovich laughs.
C: MALKOVICH
D: Faster! Faster, my little trained monkeys!
E: CONT'D
N: The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over, exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to help, nobody dares.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
N: Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves in, through some gray trees and gray brush to: A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT This place is filled with life: Colorful birds, lizards, cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.
C: ELIJAH
D: Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
E: SUBTITLES
C: LOTTE
D: Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?

E: to the animals
C: ELIJAH
D: Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
N: Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt. She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS
N: Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

D: My God!
C: CRAIG
D: I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
C: LOTTE
D: I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.

D: It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
E: pecking him on the cheek
C: CRAIG
D: You came up here looking for the portal?
C: LOTTE
D: Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
C: CRAIG
D: And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
C: LOTTE
D: You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
C: CRAIG
D: I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
C: LOTTE
D: I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
C: CRAIG
D: You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
C: LOTTE
D: People make mistakes.
C: CRAIG
D: I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
C: LOTTE
D: I know.
C: CRAIG
D: I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
C: LOTTE
D: Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
E: beat
N: Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.
C: LOTTE
D: Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.
E: CONT'D
N: She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the elevator.
C: CRAIG
D: I love you, Lotte.
N: We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament. We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.
C: MANTINI
D: I can't wait to see where you and your friends live, Lotte.
E: in Craig's voice
C: LOTTE
D: It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.
E: O.S.
N: Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.
C: FLEMMER
D: One serpent, coming up.
N: Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough, looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal tunnel. MUSIC IN: "Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head" by They Might Be Giants. It plays throughout the credits.
