T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. SLATE QUARRY - DAY
N: FRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry wall.
C: THE QUARRY FOREMAN
D: looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time... Millerock time! Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of the workday --
C: ANOTHER ANGLE FRED
D: YABBA DABBA DO -- ! Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only motor , slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and OVER --
E: his feet
C: MUSIC
D: 'Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones, They're a modern Stone age fam-i-ly --'
E: V.O.
N: -- And so forth, as for the first time in "his-tor-y" we see the Flintstones' OPENING CREDITS live! TIGHT ON A MAILBOX reading "FLINTSTONE." We WIDEN as Fred SKIDS to a halt in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the saber-toothed cat. Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY, BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop in! Fred's feet slap on the street as the car starts up --
C: MUSIC
D: 'From the Town of Bedrock They're a page right Out of his-tor-y -- ' DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - DUSK
E: V.O.
N: Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma. (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON the drive-in screen and the words that America has waited twenty-five years to see in 70mm Dolby(TM) drop- your-popcorn reality:
C: THE FLINTSTONES
D: And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we -- DISSOLVE TO: AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN
N: Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land. (The third one out carries a little suitcase.) CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange, hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven- foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus. It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a canvas sack, but we don't stress this.) Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the Xenosaurus. NEW ANGLE Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads
S: BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE
N: EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and we see -- Bedrock! Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light. The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight. WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "WELCOME TO BEDROCK" billboard which bears greetings from the Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course) The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and trot over the rise, coast down to the street below. The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --
C: A MILKMAN
D: who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway. As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.
C: REAR OF TRUCK
D: -- revealing that the back of the truck is actually a giant-jawed CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The garbage men dump the cans into its maw... it happily swallows the works, licks its lips, BELCHES. BACK TO SCENE
N: The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise, who winces as they drive off.
C: TORTOISE
D: You can forget about a tip for Christmas...
E: under his breath
N: It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn timer" box which now pops open. Inside the box is a "ROOSTERSAURUS" which CROWS and flaps its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube Goldberg...
C: FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES
D: They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its snout.
N: Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow their revolutions. The one closest to the house scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.
C: LITTLE MAMMOTH
D: Oh, my aching sinuses...
E: sotto
S: INT. FLINTSTONES' BEDROOM - DAY
N: WIDEN FROM the windowsill, where a little sea shell hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS "COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO" into the ear of a "CLOCK RADIO WOODPECKER." The Woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed, puts a timecard in a little clock. Then it turns and begins pecking on a BELL, which RINGS PIERCINGLY.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NEW ANGLE
N: Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper is thrown without aiming --
C: THE WOODPECKER
D: ducks just in time. It wipes its forehead nervously.
C: RADIO WOODPECKER
D: I hate this job... There's not even a health plan...
E: sotto
N: He staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not to "ALARM" but to "ALARM & RADIO." The WOODPECKER SIGHS, looks over at the bed where SNORING is still emanating. Then the bird swings a little telescope around to point out the window. WOODPECKER'S TELESCOPE - IRIS SHOT as the 'SCOPE PANS and FOCUSES, finally SETTLING ON a distant stone building marked RADIO STATION B-ROK. Perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey and an octopus. The monkey holds up cue cards which the octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags. BACK TO SCENE Our WOODPECKER squints, CLEARS his THROAT.
C: RADIO WOODPECKER
D: Good morning, Bedrock. This is station B-R-O-K with the morning weather and news... IN THE BED
E: deeper "on-air" voice
N: The big bulge GRUNTS and MUTTERS a bit, then one hand gropes around, finds the curvaceous form under the neighboring covers... feels it tentatively... then the fingers "walk" upwards...
C: RADIO WOODPECKER
D: It will be fair and mild through the weekend, continuing for the next eight hundred years, followed by cooling breezes and a protracted ice age... Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.
E: O.S.
C: FRED
D: Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a great big good morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy? And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.
E: with genuine charm
C: FRED
D: Dino! Dino, cut it out -- !
C: RADIO WOODPECKER
D: In the news, Bedrock civic and business leaders met yesterday to discuss the growing kibble crisis.
E: O.S. MORE
C: RADIO WOODPECKER
D: Ecological activist Ralph Naderock warned that if new supplies of kibble are not found, our animal- powered civilization itself may be threatened.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: By now Dino's affection attack has knocked both master and pet to the floor in a jumble of bedclothes, asses and elbows. Dino begins to roll Fred across the room like a seal playing with a ball.
C: FRED
D: Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it --
N: Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS." Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes out. DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.
S: INT. FLINTSTONE KITCHEN - DAY
N: Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion. Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under- stand Fred's romantic turn.
C: RADIO WOODPECKER
D: In other news, Bedrock police report that the Xenosaurus has struck again! Yes, the fiercesome intruder was sighted in the Bedrock Hills for the third time this month. Outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property destruction...
E: O.S.
C: WILMA
D: Fred, stop playing with Dino and sit down. Your breakfast's getting cold.
N: Saying this, Wilma puts a huge egg at Fred's place. Meanwhile, Fred manages to get to his feet, holds out one arm to keep Dino at bay. Fred does a big "take," looking out the window --
C: FRED
D: Oooh, Dino, look -- there's a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn -- !
E: throwing open the door
N: Pause. Dino gives him a big look as if to say, "Oh, yeah?"
C: FRED
D: -- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino --
E: trying again
N: "YI-YI-YI-YI," DINO is out the door like a rocket. Fred cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table.
C: FRED
D: -- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats?
C: WILMA
D: So is everybody else in Bedrock. That kibble crisis is getting worse every day. She puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster. Two claw-like devices hold the toast, pulling it out of sight.
C: WILMA
D: I'm afraid Dino's going to have to manage on leftovers from Pebbles and me.
C: FRED
D: And what's wrong with my leftovers?
E: sitting down
C: WILMA
D: I'll let you know when I see some.
C: RADIO WOODPECKER
D: ... Scientists from B.C. University report that the footprints of the Xenosaurus match no known animal.
E: O.S. finishing up
C: PEBBLES
D: Mommy, is the bad Ze-ze-zenosaurus gonna get me and eat me up?
C: WILMA
D: Of course not, baby.
C: FRED
D: That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me!
N: And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her.
C: PEBBLES
D: I'm still a little scared...
E: giggling, calming
C: FRED
D: Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out.
C: FRED
D: -- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here --
N: "YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door, lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against the door. Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.
C: LOBSTER
D: Well, it beats working in a seafood restaurant...
C: FRED
D: Thanks, Wilma... Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye.
E: taking the toast
N: HIS POV - STREET A paperboy on a wood-and-stone bicycle is coming rapidly towards the house. In the bike's basket is a stack of dried, rock-hard clay tablets. BACK TO SCENE Fred leans out the window, waving his hands.
C: FRED
D: Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this action in time to see -- HIS DRIVEWAY - THROUGH THE OTHER WINDOW The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast.
C: WILMA
D: Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.
C: FRED
D: Yeah. What else can go wrong?
E: slight smile
N: He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps, knocking Fred over as it takes off through the window.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FLINTSTONE DRIVEWAY - LATER
N: Fred -- now dressed for work -- is forlornly trying to fix his car. In the neighboring driveway, Wilma and Betty pile the kids into Betty's car.
C: BETTY
D: Come on, kids. Time for nursery school.
E: wiping their mouths
C: PEBBLES
D: 'Bye-bye, Daddy.
C: FRED
D: 'Bye, little sweetheart. 'Bye, big sweetheart.
E: as Wilma clears her throat
N: Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs, tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news- paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS STRIKES AGAIN. Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but the voice is that of --
C: BARNEY
D: Nice morning, huh, Fred?
C: FRED
D: What's nice about it?
C: BARNEY
D: Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he?
N: Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the hedge.
C: FRED
D: This is the third ragtop this year ... say, shouldn't you be at work?
C: BARNEY
D: Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment --
C: FRED
D: You got fired, didn't ya?
C: BARNEY
D: Fred, don't start on me again. I donno, I'm just not a nine to five guy. I got dreams, Fred. Ideas --
C: FRED
D: Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on.
C: BARNEY
D: I invented fire.
C: FRED
D: You invented fire?
E: pause
C: BARNEY
D: I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas --
C: FRED
D: Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get?
N: Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges, examines it with dismay.
C: FRED
D: If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano...
C: BARNEY
D: Maybe, Fred. But first...
N: He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood from Fred's surprised grasp.
C: BARNEY
D: Let me try some of that smoke on your car.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BARNEY'S GARAGE/WORKSHOP - DAY
N: We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway. (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion). Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work). Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
C: BARNEY
D: -- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash. Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.
E: as he works
C: BARNEY
D: -- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries...
C: FRED
D: Two coo-coo berries? You made of money, Barney?
E: impressed
C: BARNEY
D: Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin.
N: NEW ANGLE Fred is caked with dust. He coughs and spits.
C: FRED
D: Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to --
N: He stops as Barney cranks up the weight on a ratchet, proudly lifts out a perfect (though greenish) duplicate of the car hood. As Fred examines it, impressed despite himself, we...
T: CUT TO:
N: BETTY'S CAR - TRAVELING The two kids are in the back seat. Somehow both of the kids' faces are messy again. Working together with beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the rear armrests and door handles.
C: BETTY
D: ... Oh, it's not that I'm complaining, Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but... well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock. And he's such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook? They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids.
E: in mid-speech, driving
C: BETTY
D: No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs.
N: She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids, who immediately run into the schoolyard.
C: MRS. GRANITE
D: Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I wanted to thank you personally.
E: approaching
C: BETTY
D: You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day.
C: MRS. GRANITE
D: No, no, I mean for all your wonderful support the past few years. It's parents like you that make me think twice about retiring.
N: From the schoolyard comes the sudden sound of KIDS QUAR- RELING and then a THUD and some CRYING.
C: MRS. GRANITE
D: On the other hand...
N: Wilma and Betty laugh.
C: WILMA
D: We're really going to miss you, too, Mrs. Granite.
C: MRS. GRANITE
D: Have you found another school for the children?
C: BETTY
D: We're still shopping around.
C: WILMA
D: Fortunately, we're both -- Wilma and Betty straighten... salute.
N: WILMA & BETTY (they've done this routine before) -- Professional shoppers! As the three women laugh, we...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEDROCK STREET - TRAVELLING - DAY
N: Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm... split level, two palms... duplex, palm). Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.
C: BARNEY
D: Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock.
C: FRED
D: Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice?
C: BARNEY
D: Did I ever?
C: FRED
D: You stick with me today, cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application. I'm a big man there, Barney --
C: BARNEY
D: You're a big man anywhere, Fred --
C: FRED
D: I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this -- He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead.
C: FRED
D: -- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us. It's time to retire those dreams. Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything. Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car.
E: meaningfully
C: FRED
D: Barney. Look.
C: WIDE SHOT
D: They're at the crest of a high wide hill.
C: BARNEY
D: Hey. Lava Lane.
C: FRED
D: Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls.
C: BARNEY
D: Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!
E: wistful
N: A look from one to another, and then down the hill... Fred gets a malicious grin on his face.
C: BARNEY
D: Fred... I thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams.
C: FRED
D: Hey. Since when do I have to be consistent?
N: The two pals laugh, and then with a whoop they begin pedalling like mad. They go over the top, gravity takes over and they are flying past that billboard with all the Rotary Club welcomes on it. But now we see a different sort of welcome, as a POLICE CAR ZOOMS out from behind it. POLICE CAR - CLOSER Inside are SERGEANT FELDSPAR and his rookie partner, OFFICER GRAVEL. Cackling with anticipation, Feldspar opens a box marked radar detector. Out pops a little bird in a police helmet. It has a stopwatch (actually, stop-sundial) around its neck. Feldspar points -- the bird salutes -- takes off!
C: FRED AND BARNEY BARNEY
D: Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !
E: spotting the cops
N: Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice as --
C: THE POLICE CAR
D: cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.
C: FELDSPAR
D: Well, Flintstone, looks like today's the day.
C: FRED
D: Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest...
N: Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks... ANGLE ON FLOORBOARD There's a box there marked RADAR BUSTER.
C: FELDSPAR
D: Forget it, Flintstone. This time I got you dead to rights -- Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.
E: O.S.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird, turns to his rookie partner.
C: FELDSPAR
D: Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I'll show you how we deal with scofflaws.
N: Gravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard which is hovering nearby, licking its lips.
C: RADAR BIRD
D: Whoa! Wings, do your stuff -- !
N: The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour, leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind. Feldspar catches the watch, startled.
C: FRED
D: Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- -- justbeonourway -- !
E: quickly
N: A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away.
C: FELDSPAR
D: Flintstone! Flintstone, come back here -- ! CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEDROCK BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
N: Betty and Wilma have just pulled up. We notice that next to their legal spot, a big limousine is parked in a "no parking" zone. But our law-abiding Betty in the next space now drops a stone coin in a parking meter. CLOSE ON THE METER Inside the window we see a LITTLE BIRD. It "bites" the coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer.
C: LITTLE BIRD
D: Four years in accounting school for this... INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
E: with a sigh
N: It's absolutely mobbed. Customers push past each other with armloads of food. Gigantic cuts of meat hang from above or are on display behind the counter. MORRIS THE BUTCHER looks up from the chaos and manages a weak smile for the girls.
C: BETTY
D: Morris, what on earth is going on? You giving away Bronto filets?
C: MORRIS
D: Ah, my two loveliest customers. It's this darn kibble crisis, Mrs. R... people are buying everything I got to feed their dinos...
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Young man, if you're through flirting, I'd like some service. NEW ANGLE
N: REVEALING MRS. SLATE, who stands there, impatient and overdressed.
C: MORRIS
D: Of course, Mrs. Slate. Just take a number. Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break it with a smile.
C: WILMA
D: Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate.
N: Morris reacts with relief. Mrs. Slate reacts with a blank look.
C: WILMA
D: We met at the quarry picnic?
E: prompting
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Oh, of course. Mrs. Flintstein.
N: She turns her back to Wilma, forces her way towards the counter again. Wilma burns.
C: MORRIS
D: Ladies, the meat's not getting any fresher. Mrs. R, what'll it be?
C: BETTY
D: Oh, I'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh... some dodo drumsticks.
C: MORRIS
D: Gino? We got any dodo bird?
N: GINO turns, looks at his end of the counter.
C: GINO
D: There's one left -- and it's the last one!
C: MORRIS
D: Good. Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with this.
E: handing him the note
N: Gino nods, smiling. He picks up a crate, begins to load it with giant fryer parts and several manhole-sized meat patties.
C: MORRIS
D: How about you, Mrs. F?
E: turning to Betty
C: WILMA
D: I just need a few things for Fred.
C: MORRIS
D: 'Fred...'? David! Herman! Get Rob and BoBo and tell 'em to bring the big dolly!
E: calling into the back
C: VOICE FROM BACK
D: Flintstone again, huh?
E: O.S.
C: MORRIS
D: You got it. Now then... Mrs. Slate? You're in a no parking zone there.
E: pointing at the limo outside the shop
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Well, if I get some service, I'll be out of it, won't I? Mrs. Slate steps to the counter. Meanwhile, the staff begin using a refrigerator dolly to bring out giant ribs, steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of Wilma.
C: MRS. SLATE
D: I want a nice fresh, juicy chickensaurus, Morris. And not one you've had laying around on the shelf. I mean fresh.
C: MORRIS
D: Mrs. Slate, we're kind of busy now --
C: MRS. SLATE
D: I don't care if you're busy. What I care about is my adorable little grand nephew. He's staying with me for the summer and I intend to make his favorite dish... Southern fried chickensaurus! Now I want a fresh chickensaurus and I want it now!
C: MORRIS
D: Boys, you heard her... she said fresh. THE STAFF
N: with a sigh, they buckle on elbow and knee protectors, go to a side door, open it. Inside is another barred door. They open it, go inside. Immediately we hear loud SQUAWKING and CACKLING... THUDS, BUMPS... NEW ANGLE Suddenly the barred door slams open and a giant chicken- saurus comes bounding out, with Morris's staff hanging all over it like rodeo cowboys. They try and restrain it with ropes but it's enraged and flops around the store.
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Morris, while you're at it, I'd like it plucked --
E: oblivious of the trouble
N: Suddenly the chickensaurus snaps the ropes, flaps its wings and leaps through the front window --
S: EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
N: The huge bird lands with a crunch atop Mrs. Slate's car, which is practically squashed flat. Then it disappears around the corner. (We hear CAR HORNS and SKIDDING TIRES as it goes.) BACK TO SCENE
C: MRS. SLATE
D: My car -- !
N: Wilma and Betty try and hide their laughter.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SLATE CONSTRUCTION - DAY
N: Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light. CLOSER - FRED'S CAR Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here. He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on, knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F. Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the quarry area.
C: FRED
D: Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo --
C: NEW ANGLE
D: Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.
C: GIRL
D: Hi, Mr. Flintstone.
E: New York accent
C: FRED
D: Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay?
C: GIRL
D: Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.
N: She slams down two clay tablets and a stylus.
C: GIRL
D: Here you go. Thanks again for the football tickets. My boyfriend and I both liked them.
E: smiling
C: FRED
D: My pleasure, Shirl. Anytime.
C: GIRL
D: Okay. But do you think next time we could go to the same game?
C: FRED
D: No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
E: confidently
C: FRED
D: Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint.
C: BARNEY
D: Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OFFICE - PULLBACK FROM WINDOW
N: The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural model of a large scale construction project. There's acres of little development houses, then some tall office buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot- powered model cars in the model parking spaces. Near this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con- struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer- curial moods.
C: LAVA
D: Uncle, if you'll look at this unit cost projection... it intersects here with --
C: SLATE
D: -- how'd you like my fist to intersect with your nose? I've told you a hundred times, don't call me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't arrange your scholarship to Harvrock University so you could waste my time! So stop beating around the bushasaurus and get to the bottom slime!
C: LAVA
D: You'll be bankrupt in six months. Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model. EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides.
C: BARNEY
D: Social Security number... dependents... 'how learned of job' ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon... ... Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --
E: to himself writing
N: FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in- side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and then propels his wrecking ball towards the... QUARRY WALL - ABOVE -- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts balanced on a boulder.
C: WIDER
D: Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one in place.
E: It should be noted here that the relationship and physi- cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and Barney.
C: PYRITE
D: Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks says you can't hit one on the fly.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Yer on, Pyrite -- Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge. The wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall. BELOW
E: calling up
N: Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down. People grab for their construction helmets.
C: FRED
D: Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.
C: FRED
D: All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers!
C: PILTDOWN
D: Yeah? Sez who?
C: FRED
D: Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives us workers a snack break. So... ... I'm breakin' some snacks.
E: a nasty grin
N: He swings the wrecking ball again.
C: UP ABOVE
D: This time he's overdone it: The wrecking ball flies past the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks for cover -- and then the wrecking ball whips over and around the handrail which runs along here, twisting as tightly as Indiana Jones' whip. The handrail wobbles dangerously in its foundation --
C: PILTDOWN'S DINO
D: SNORTS, backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin to CREAK and GROAN with the strain --
C: WIDER
D: Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse. Fred runs to grab the dino's reins.
C: FRED
D: Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot. As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
C: FRED
D: You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow!
E: calling up to the cab
C: PILTDOWN
D: You've been asking for this, Flintstone... I'm gonna kick your fat butt --
E: leaping down
C: FRED
D: Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees -- THE CRANE ON THE DINO'S BACK
E: sotto, very sincere
N: It is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down.
C: BACK TO SCENE BARNEY
D: Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Why should we?
C: BARNEY
D: It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime.
C: FRED
D: Yeah. That's right. I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess. With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it...
E: realizing, a glare at Barney turning, shouting
S: INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
N: Slate stands in a blubbering fury as Lava mops coffee up from the model and Slate's face.
C: SLATE
D: Bankrupt? Are you crazy?
N: Lava holds up a clay tablet covered with figures.
C: LAVA
D: It's all here in hack and slice. When you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton. Since then, it's gone up a hundredfold. You can't build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos, and we can't afford to feed those dinos.
E: indicating the model
N: Slate glowers, paces around the model.
C: SLATE
D: I'm two months behind schedule, my option's running out on the land and Donald Trumprock is just waiting to jump in and steal the whole deal ... meanwhile that damn union's on my back, hell, they'll probably want an eighty hour week or something... There's got to be an answer...
E: frustrated
N: A LOUD COMMOTION outside the window attracts everyone's attention.
C: SLATE
D: What's that?
C: LAVA
D: Sounds like a worker's comp claim if I ever heard one...
E: worried
N: All rush to the window. They look out and see -- THE QUARRY - WIDE Supervised by Fred, all the workers are straining on the ropes to haul the rear legs of the crane back into their sockets on the back of the big dino. Only the last critical rope is still dangling.
C: FRED
D: Barney! Grab that line! Hurry! Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort...
C: THE CRANE
D: THUDS into place on the dino's back -- the workers cheer --
C: THE WRECKING BALL
D: alas, with its cable now twisted shorter, it's become an immovable object, and as the shortened CABLE SNAPS, the wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall.
C: NEW ANGLE
D: Men and ANIMALS YELP and dive out of the way as the BALL rolls downwards, SMASHING everything in its path. EXT. SLATE'S OFFICE WINDOW
T: The executives watch concerned as --
N: THE WRECKING BALL tumbles down, down, knocking scaffolding and ladders aside, reaches the end of a ramp, and drops through the air right onto -- THE HOOD OF FRED'S CAR -- where, astonishingly, the HOOD sinks in resiliently like a trampoline and then with a loud "SPROING" the wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air, followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself. Both hurtle TOWARDS the CAMERA --
T: SLATE AND EXECUTIVES
N: react fearfully as they realize all this is coming straight for them. With a howl, they all dive aside --
S: INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - WIDER - DAY
N: The wrecking BALL flies through the window, SLAMS onto Slate's desk, crushing everything in its path and then sails on SMASHING right into -- THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT -- where all of the lined up HIGH RISES SMASH ASIDE with a sound like falling pins. IN THE QUARRY The workers pick themselves up and now their eyes follow the path taken by the long-gone wrecking ball.
C: FRED
D: Oh boy. Goodbye pension fund -- They rush for the office building.
S: INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Dust is still settling. The staff rises from the mess, coughing. Lava rummages in the debris, finds a stiff body.
C: LAVA
D: Uncle, Uncle, speak to me -- But it's only a statue of a golfer from one of Slate's trophies.
C: SLATE
D: I'm over here, you moron -- and don't call me 'Uncle'!
E: sitting up
N: Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a bookshelf. He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside. THEIR POV - OFFICE As they take in the destruction. Barney notices the wrecking ball amidst the model buildings. As we watch, the last remaining little HIGH RISE FALLS.
C: BARNEY
D: Hey, nice going, Fred. You even got the spare --
C: FRED
D: Barney, shut up -- Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right? Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES in his hands like a hand saw.
E: turning
C: SLATE
D: For five years Slate Construction has had the finest safety record in Bedrock. Our workers are trained in first aid, our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free. And then something like this happens ... I want to know how! A cacophony of voices starts to answer.
E: eying the men pacing, angry
C: SLATE
D: Shut up! I want one person to answer me: Who's responsible for this? PILTDOWN
E: in the sudden silence waving the car hood
N: nudges the wrecking ball off the edge of the table. It falls on Fred's foot. Fred starts to scream and Piltdown shoves a pencil holder into his mouth.
C: PILTDOWN
D: It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate!
E: quickly
C: PYRITE
D: That's right, Mr. Slate, it was Flintstone!
C: BARNEY
D: That's a lie, Mr. Slate!
C: SLATE
D: Who are you?
C: BARNEY
D: B. Rubble. White male personal reference --
E: pointing to his forms
C: SLATE
D: Flintstone, I have just one thing to say to you -- Fred cringes. Piltdown and Pyrite smirk.
E: pushing Barney aside
C: SLATE
D: Congratulations!
E: pumping his hand
C: FRED PILTDOWN
D: Huh? What?
C: SLATE
D: This stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material I've seen in thirty years in the construction business! It's strong -- -- Light -- -- Resilient -- It rebounds, "SPROINGING" him on the chin. He recovers, shakes it off.
E: testing it twirling it bending it
C: SLATE
D: Where on earth did you get it?
C: FRED
D: Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn?
E: quickly
C: BARNEY
D: Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "Slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate.
C: BARNEY
D: Sure, Fred, right, right. Slate nods, distracted, his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood.
E: reluctant
C: SLATE
D: The rest of you men go back to work. I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move, move... They go out, Piltdown looking furious.
C: SLATE
D: Light as a Pterodactyl feather... why, a child could handle this... Lava, we could cut construction costs in half... in quarters... in uh... whatchacallit --
E: a man in love
C: LAVA
D: Eighths --
E: patiently
C: SLATE
D: Eighths, right. Flintstone, what do you call this stuff?
C: FRED
D: Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- -- Barney, what do I call it?
E: hesitating, sotto
C: BARNEY
D: Fibrerock, Fred...
E: sotto
C: FRED
D: -- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'!
E: realizing
C: SLATE
D: 'Fibrerock'? 'Fibrerock'? 'Fib-bre-rock' --
E: rolling it over his tongue playing with it
N: Slate's staff make disparaging noises.
C: SLATE
D: I love it!
C: SLATE'S STAFF
D: Love it... great... has a nice ring... says it all, you know? Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney.
E: instantly reversing themselves Etc...
C: SLATE
D: You see this, Lava? All those courses of yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon? Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies.
E: to Lava
C: BARNEY
D: Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement.
C: SLATE
D: Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction... a giant step for all mankind. He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it.
C: SLATE
D: The Stone Age is over! Let the Fibre Age begin! As HEROIC MUSIC STINGS IN, we...
E: dramatically
T: CUT TO:
N: BETTY'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY Mrs. Slate is in back, crammed in with groceries. Betty pulls up in front of a building that looks like a Palm Springs spa. This is "L'ECOLE DES ENFANTS PREHISTORIQUE HAUTE SUPERIOR."
C: BETTY
D: Here we are, Mrs. Slate. Sorry you had to ride in the back.
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Not at all. I'm used to being driven around. And she's sashaying up the path. Betty and Wilma burn, then follow her.
E: getting out
S: INT. SCHOOL - DAY
N: As elegant as we can get MMMCXV years before Louis XIV. As the three women come in, we see CHILDREN with alliga- tors on their deerskin shirts singing:
C: CHILDREN
D: 'La hachette de ma tante est sur le roche de mon oncle -- '
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: Madame Mrs. Slate, bonjour! Welcome to L'ecole des Enfants Prehistorique Haute Superior!
E: coming over, gushing
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Thank you, Marie. I ordered the hors d'oeuvres for the junior talent show. They were out of Ceolanth caviar so I got Mastodon brie instead. Oh, ah, these are my, uh, friends, Wilma Flintstein --
E: showing a rock receipt
C: WILMA
D: Flintstone --
C: MRS. SLATE
D: -- oh, it used to be Flintstein -- ? And this is ah, Becky... Betty!
N: The Headmistress reaches over, takes their hands gracefully.
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: Enchante.
C: WILMA
D: I'm sure.
C: BETTY
D: Likewise.
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: Well, Madame Slate, as you can see, we remain ze creme de la creme in the croissant of life known as Bedrock. Now, your leetle gran' nephew will be wiz us for two weeks, no? Here is ze application for him. An' mais oui, he weel participate in zee annual talent show, naturalment?
E: waving a hand opening a drawer
N: Mrs. Slate takes the parchment application. Meanwhile the Headmistress looks appraisingly at Wilma and Betty.
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: An' your friends perhaps would like zum school applications for zere enfants?
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Them? Oh, Marie, really, you don't understand --
E: amused
C: BETTY
D: That's right, you don't understand. My husband's business manager usually handles this sort of thing, but I don't mind. And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the parchments.
E: suddenly
C: BETTY
D: I know Bam-Bam -- -- pardonez-moi, 'Bem-Bem' will love attending your school and performing in the talent show. Thank you oh so much.
E: correcting herself
N: She gives Mrs. Slate an even and controlled look, and sends some of it over in Wilma's direction as well. Wilma makes her choice, smiles tightly.
C: WILMA
D: Let me have one of those, too. For ma petite Pebbles.
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: Of course. Any friend of Madame Slate is a friend of mine. As Mrs. Slate reacts, we --

S: INT. CAR - FRED AND BARNEY - NIGHT
N: They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the back seat are some boxes and bundles.
C: BARNEY
D: Gee, Fred, I don't believe it. Eight hours ago I didn't have a job and now look -- I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock!
C: FRED
D: Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print. It's like I told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work. Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right?
E: full of himself
C: BARNEY
D: No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident.
C: FRED
D: Details, Barney, details... I just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell 'em the news... INT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT
E: after a moment smiling
N: The girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands' smiles. Wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms. Betty paces, looks at the clock.
C: WILMA
D: It's not like the boys to be so late.
E: seeing this
C: BETTY
D: Unless they were forced to go bowling again. Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, 'go bowling right now'?
C: WILMA
D: Betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible --
C: BETTY
D: Don't tell me. I still can't believe what I did today...
C: WILMA
D: No kidding. Do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is? And get this... it's non-refundable --
E: indicating the forms
C: BETTY
D: I know, I know! I just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing I knew, I was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too?
C: WILMA
D: Oh, she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew... and...
C: BETTY
D: And?
C: WILMA
D: And... if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can?
N: Betty smiles, touched. Then reality intrudes again.
C: BETTY
D: What do we tell the boys?
C: WILMA
D: What's wrong with the truth?
C: BETTY
D: We put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we can't stand?
C: WILMA
D: Maybe we could rephrase it... Suddenly the door bursts open. Fred and Barney run in with candy and flowers.
E: pause
C: FRED AND BARNEY
D: Surprise!
N: Pause.
C: BETTY
D: Flowers?
C: WILMA
D: Rock candy? That's nice, but... why?
C: FRED
D: Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change.
C: WILMA
D: Not anymore you don't...
E: sotto
C: BARNEY
D: Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.
E: presenting flowers
C: BETTY
D: Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve these. I did something really stupid today.
C: BARNEY
D: Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him.
N: Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock.
C: FRED
D: Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- !
C: WILMA
D: Have you been drinking? In reply, Fred whips a bottle of champagne into view.
E: observing this
C: FRED
D: Ready when you are. Hey, '1'... a good year.
E: noticing the label
N: This confuses the girls even more.
C: WILMA
D: Fred, there's no easy way to say this so --
N: She closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on the table so that Fred and Barney can read them. Fred and Barney look at them, look at each other... and yawn.
C: FAVORING WILMA AND BETTY
D: They can't believe this.
C: BETTY
D: Boys... did you see... the dollar signs there at the bottom?
C: WILMA
D: The non-refundable dollar signs?
C: BARNEY
D: Plenty more where that came from.
C: FRED
D: We see your dollar signs, ladies... and...
N: He tosses his stone contracts on top of the parchment ones with a THUD.
C: FRED
D: ... we raise them.
N: Wilma and Betty look at each other, then at the contracts. They blink, look again.
C: WILMA
D: Betty... these... these look... real --
N: Fred opens the champagne, which foams all over them. The girls squeal.
C: FRED
D: You bet they're real, sweetheart. They're as real as... as... well, as real as -- -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world.
E: embracing the group

S: EXT. WATER BUFFALO LODGE - NIGHT
N: A sign proclaims this as "GRAND BEDROCK LODGE -- LOYAL ORDER OF WATER BUFFALO." The parking lot outside is full of vehicles. We hear the sound of a GAVEL BANGING...
C: HERDMASTER
D: Attention, fellow Water Buffaloes... INT. WATER BUFFALO LODGE - NIGHT
E: V.O.
N: The members are milling about the main room, schmoozing, drinking, kibitzing. All wear the furry and horned ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo. One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below); a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various bowling trophies, balls and pins. At the lectern, the HERDMASTER (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs again for order.
C: HERDMASTER
D: Brothers, your attention!
N: It quiets a bit. He clears his throat, raises his chin, and gives a strange mournful bellow.
C: HERDMASTER
D: The herd is now called to the prairie. Antlers... up!
E: "ritual" type tone holding fingers above ears
N: The entire Lodge dutifully imitates this gesture.
C: ENTIRE GROUP
D: Ack-ack-a-dack!
C: HERDMASTER
D: This meeting of the Water Buffaloes is now in session. Sergeant-at-Arms, have we got any old business? Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge brothers.
E: banging gavel
C: BARNEY
D: Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier call to order.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: After the CRY ECHOES away:
C: HERDMASTER
D: Brother Piltdown: You have given the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you wish to file an objection?
C: PILTDOWN
D: You bet I do. How come Flintstone is 'good old Fred' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys'?
C: PYRITE
D: Yeah, how come?
C: BARNEY
D: My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... ... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone! Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down. NEW ANGLE
E: rising pause
N: Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office. Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.
C: FRED
D: Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux...
E: reading, at first wooden, then confident
C: BARNEY
D: -- crucible --
E: hissing
C: FRED
D: -- crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack. Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.
E: grateful
N: PILTDOWN AND PYRITE The only ones in their row not clapping, they scowl as Fred passes them...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LODGE - RECREATION AREA - LATER
N: WIDEN as Barney propels a bowling ball (stone, of course) rumbling down the alley, sending pins flying. The Buffaloes cheer Barney's strike. We notice that most (if not all) of these Lodge members also work at the quarry.
C: AUTOMATIC PIN SPOTTER
D: It descends. It consists of a bent snout creature which "cranks" down a shelf with several monkeys on it. The monkeys grab the pins with their tails, straighten them up. Then the shelf cranks back up. OTHER END OF ALLEY
N: Now it's Fred's turn. He trots up to the line, bowls... another strike! More cheers, AD LIB complaints, etc. The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out the last frame.
C: LODGE MEMBER
D: Congratulations, Fred.
C: FRED
D: Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone.
C: BARNEY
D: Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free.
C: FRED
D: But the principle is the same, Barn. Don't forget that. Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew? Fred reaches --
C: UNDER THE COUNTER
D: where he pulls out a hook-beaked little LIZARD --
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Fred uses this creature to open several beers.
C: FRED
D: Here you go, boys, nice and frosty...
E: during this
C: "BOTTLE OPENER" CREATURE
D: Go ahead, laugh. If I had a good orthodontist, my life woulda been different... Fred tosses the "Opener" aside --
E: LIZARD aside
C: UNDER THE COUNTER
D: The critter bounces into the shelf, slides... when it re- covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened out by the impact. Very happy, it grabs a hat and coat, exits. BACK TO SCENE
C: FRED
D: Well, here's to...
E: raising drink
N: He looks around, sees -- "PHOTO" ON WALL It's actually "dots" chipped into a stone. It shows the young Fred, Barney and others gathered around soapbox racers. A banner reads "Junior Buffalo Day."
C: BACK TO SCENE FRED
D: Here's to the greatest bunch of lifelong Buffaloes a guy could dream of leading. Anybody else got a toast...?
E: an obvious prompt
C: BARNEY
D: 'Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster... Fred'!
C: FRED
D: Aw, gee, Barn... you shouldn't say that... ... at least not till after next week's election!

D: Fred, what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace? I thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat -- Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into his pocket.
C: FRED
D: Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world... Boys, you're looking at Mr. Slate's new partner.
C: PILTDOWN
D: You and Slate? Who are you kidding, Flintstone? The only partner you got is hanging over your belt. Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.
C: FRED
D: Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown.
C: PILTDOWN
D: -- If I don't, you will --
C: FRED
D: Gentlemen, my card -- He passes them out, and the others take them, curious --
E: a tight smile
N: INSERT - CARD Of course it's a little stone tablet... but it does indeed say "SLATE CONSTRUCTION -- F. FLINTSTONE, ASSISTANT JR. V.P. -- PUBLIC RELATIONS." BACK TO SCENE
C: LODGE MEMBERS
D: Hey, way ta go, Fred... Whoa, gonna switch from a hard hat to a top hat, Freddy boy...?
E: AD LIB, impressed
C: PYRITE
D: Ah, it's probably a phony...
E: examining the card
N: Saying this, he bites down on it... winces as a tooth cracks.
C: BARNEY
D: tugs Fred's sleeve, pulls him close.
C: BARNEY
D: Gee, Fred, how come I didn't get any business cards?
C: FRED
D: Barney, it's all part of the plan. Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse --
E: to the others Barney reacts to the "single-handedly" --
C: FRED
D: -- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- '
C: BARNEY
D: Fred, we gotta talk turkey --
C: FRED
D: That's right -- just like that --
C: BARNEY
D: Fred -- !
N: Fred realizes Barney's got something on his mind.
C: FRED
D: Ah, excuse us, boys...
C: NEW ANGLE
D: Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them.
E: There's also trophies for "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs"; these have only Fred's name on them.
C: BARNEY
D: Fred... what's this single-handed stuff? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.
C: FRED
D: Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be?
E: lowered voice
C: BARNEY
D: The truth?
C: FRED
D: This is big business, Barney. We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time. Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
C: BARNEY
D: Okay.
C: FRED
D: What do they all have in common? I'll tell you. A front man. A guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner.
E: as Barney is stumped
C: BARNEY
D: I never knew that.
C: FRED
D: That's because the silent partner is always silent.
E: MORE
C: FRED
D: But while you're busy being silent -- -- all along you're the brains behind the operation and I'm the brains in front of the operation. I'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you're really behind.
E: CONT'D conspiratorially
C: BARNEY
D: I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them.
C: FRED
D: Attaboy! And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure "silent partner"... CUT TO:
S: EXT. FLINTSTONE/RUBBLE HOUSES - DAY
N: Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out, calls to her husband.
C: BETTY
D: Barney, wait a minute...
C: CLOSER
D: He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear- ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty fixes the knot.
C: BETTY
D: There. That looks more like a captain of industry.
C: BARNEY
D: Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you?
C: BETTY
D: Hmm. Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries.
C: BARNEY
D: Come on, Betty, it's only my first day. You have to have seniority to run off... She giggles, kisses him.
C: FRED
D: is at the car door, lunch pail in hand, when Wilma calls out to him.
C: WILMA
D: Fred! Wait a minute! There's something wrong with your lunch --
C: FRED
D: Yeah... it does feel a little light... He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is embossed on it in gold.
E: "weighing it"
C: WILMA
D: Fit for a king... my king.
C: FRED
D: Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock -- He opens it. Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.
C: FRED
D: -- Baby, you're the greatest.
C: WILMA
D: Good luck. Watch out for those... you know... hostile takeovers.
E: kissing him pause
C: FRED
D: I'm already taken. He moves to the car.
C: FRED
D: Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock Rubbles?
C: BARNEY
D: Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I see you've recovered from that polo accident.

D: Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse drowned. They crack up at their own wit, drive off.

N: SLATE QUARRY - LAVA'S OFFICE - DAY Lava's on the phone, very worried.
C: LAVA
D: Ivan, look, okay, so I bought too much on margin... everyone said glaciers were here to stay, I mean, who knew? Just leverage my shares in Atlantis dry goods and -- what? When did that happen? Piltdown enters, knocks on the open door.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Mister Lava, the armored car is here.
C: LAVA
D: Armored car...?
C: PILTDOWN
D: Yeah. Must be a fortune in coo-coo berries on that baby. You know, for that Fibrerock stuff of Flintstone and Rubble's. You gotta sign here for it.
C: LAVA
D: I... I'll get back to you.
E: into phone
N: Lava comes over, signs the form. Meanwhile he looks out the window at -- HIS POV - ARMORED CAR The guards are unloading sacks of coo-coo berries.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Lava signs the form, meanwhile looking Piltdown up and down. Finally --
C: LAVA
D: Piltdown, this Fibrerock program is going to create a lot of changes around the plant. I want to make one more. You've been a wonderful thug and goon for me. Now, I'd like to expand your duties. I want you to become a provocateur.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Gee, Mister Lava, I donno. I kinda like girls myself.
C: LAVA
D: What I mean, is, I'm going to use you to double-cross your Lodge and Union brothers, and make their lives a living hell.
E: patiently
C: PILTDOWN
D: Oh, okay.
C: LAVA
D: Good. You and your little pal will report directly to me and take orders only from me. Now get out of here and start screwing your former friends and associates.

S: EXT. QUARRY - DAY
N: Fred and Barney appear in Fred's car, make a very quick turn into the quarry lot. CLOSER They both duck down behind the wheel. A moment later, Feldspar's patrol car comes barrelling by. Feldspar looks every which way, doesn't spot them.
C: BARNEY
D: Gee, Fred, driving with you is better than an 'E' ticket at Magerock Mountain.
E: when he's gone
C: FRED
D: Gets the old adrenaline going, Barn. Us big executives, we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning.
E: getting out
N: Lava comes INTO VIEW, carrying an armload of plans.
C: LAVA
D: Flintstone! Rubble!
C: BARNEY
D: Oh, hi, Mister Lava.
C: LAVA
D: Please, call me Jerry. Uncle -- I mean, Mister Slate told me to take you to your offices. If you'll follow me...?
N: They move along. Fred notices a hotbed of activity nearby. Workers move scaffolding, animals labor.
C: FRED
D: Hey. What's going on?
C: LAVA
D: The Fibrerock assembly line. Unc -- Mister Slate's had a crew working on it all weekend. We're going to roll out the first sheets of Fibrerock by mid-week.
C: FRED
D: Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the marketplace. I approve.
C: BARNEY
D: But, Fred, it's right where the employee basketball court used ta be --
C: FRED
D: Hey, you're right... ... Big business is hell, Barney. Trust me... you'll get used to it.
E: resigned
C: BARNEY
D: I guess so. You already did. Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer.
C: LAVA
D: Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line. We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run. He goes off. Fred and Barney go --
C: INSIDE TRAILER
D: There're two tiny little desks at the far end, separated by a flimsy divider. The single window here looks out over the quarry scrap heap. Threadbare furniture on a worn rug sits under a portrait of "Our Founder" .
E: As we watch, somebody dumps a load of debris. Slate

T: CUT TO:
N: MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation. This cannot be described now with appropriate justice, but it involves a series of animal-powered conveyor belts, Rube Goldberg-like funnels, spouts and chutes, and all sorts of gadgets, gizmos, bells and whistles, to wit: At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/ chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill- type trough and is held back by a gate. Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts --
C: BARNEY
D: Ready... aim... fibre! Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough. "Fibrefoam" pours into the mold.
C: THE CLAY MOLD
D: gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga- torsaurus whaps it with its tail.
C: BELOW
D: Presto! A Fibrerock copy of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces lightly on the conveyor belt below! It sparkles with the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of Fibrerock. As it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score of identical sofas is in view.
C: END OF ASSEMBLY LINE
D: as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the Fibrerock sofas . Nearby, we see Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc. UP ANGLE - SLATE'S OFFICE BALCONY
E: often one-handed
N: Slate and Lava watch the progress, dollar signs in their eyes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: LONG MATTE SHOT - SLATE QUARRY - LATE AFTERNOON Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kane's warehouse. We see everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock table lamps to Fibrerock toilets. MUSIC OUT. CLOSER - QUARRY YARD Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony.
C: SLATE
D: Men, this is a proud day for Slate Construction. You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history... a history you are all part of... thanks to your very own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone! WORKERS - FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY
N: They cheer Slate's remarks, pat Fred on the back.
C: BACK TO SCENE SLATE
D: No longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber... because Fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it. That's why on Monday we're going to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High. They'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today. Your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City. It's non-transferable, so hang on to it. Thank you, and have a nice weekend.
E: pause
C: THE QUARRY YARD
D: The workers stand slack-jawed and stunned.
N: WORKER #1 Laid off --? WORKER #2 Pink slip --? WORKER #3 Thanks to Fred Flintstone? WORKER #4 Flintstone! What kinda shop steward are you? All eyes swivel and bore into Fred, who is as shocked as anyone.
C: BARNEY
D: Fred. You gotta do something about this!
C: FRED
D: I do? I mean, I do, yeah!
E: realizing
N: He squares his shoulders, marches off.
C: BARNEY
D: That's my Fred... INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY
E: proudly
N: Slate is practicing hitting golf balls into an automatic putting cup. Lava and some office workers are checking a blueprint against a model of "Slate City" which is made out of Fibrerock. A ball shoots back at Slate, who tees up again.
C: INSIDE THE PUTTING CUP
D: A little MOUSE in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch the ball. Stopping it with his little hockey stick, the Mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask.
C: MOUSE
D: Whew. And it's still pre-season. He whaps the ball to Slate again.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Slate tees up the ball again. Fred barges in, banging the door. Startled, Slate drives the ball instead of putting it. It sails across the room and SHATTERS a PICTURE of Mrs. Slate.
C: SLATE
D: Flintstone!
E: furious
C: FRED
D: Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --
E: undeterred
C: SLATE
D: We do, eh? About what?
C: FRED
D: About those guys outside, Mr. Slate. Some of 'em, well, they been here for years. And you, well, you can't lay them off just like -- -- that!
E: snapping fingers
N: Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs. Slate looks back at Fred, stays surprisingly calm. He toys with the putter, balances it on his palm.
C: SLATE
D: Of course I can, Fred. I can lay them off like -- -- that, or like -- -- that, or like --
E: snapping fingers a different style snap
N: He does a really nifty snap which combines with a buck- and-wing with the putter.
C: SLATE
D: -- that.
C: FRED
D: Oh, you can, huh?
E: bravura slipping
C: LAVA
D: Of course he can, Flintstone. It's his quarry.
C: SLATE
D: That's right. Why -- I could lock the front door and go fishing if I wanted!
E: still calm, warm chuckling
N: Lava laughs along with the office staff and Slate. Fred chuckles a little to fit in.
C: SLATE
D: Why, I could even fire Lava here if I wanted. Lava quivers with mock surprise. Everyone really laughs, now.
E: winking
C: SLATE
D: Or... I could fire you, Fred.
E: wiping away a tear
C: FRED
D: Me! Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr. Slate, that's -- Suddenly Fred stops laughing.
E: guffawing
C: SLATE
D: Flintstone, Lava, here, recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start. I'm a member of that public, Flintstone, and I have to say... this isn't a good start. I'm getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock. A bad feeling about... you. You want that feeling to go away, don't you?
C: FRED
D: Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah.
C: SLATE
D: Good. Then turn around and walk out of here and we'll forget all about this.

C: PEBBLES
D: Okay. We're gonna sing a song with Dino. Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a straw hat and a cane. Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical. Bam-Bam reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle. He blows it --
C: PEBBLES
D: A one-and-a-two and-a -- WIDER
N: MUSIC comes UP and Dino and his little friends do a dance routine we will call "The Dino Dance." It is a spectac- ular blend of soft-shoe and the kind of dog-and-pony-show gags usually seen in the circus or on the Ed Sullivrock show. Most importantly, the routine includes the following: A) Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop. B) The kids tie down a jump rope and Dino does a wire walk. C) And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto his back, culminating in a big "ta-da" after they all slide down the rope for a big finish.

C: FRED
D: Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened. Tell 'em the story behind Fibrerock. The true story. The room quiets. Barney clears his throat. Fred waits, hopeful.
C: BARNEY
D: Well, there's not much to tell. True, I got a cut... but Fred's got a gut.
E: trying to remember Fred's phraseology
C: FRED
D: No, no, the rest --!
C: BARNEY
D: Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but Fred's got the behind. Right, Fred?

E: a command
N: Everyone pulls their horned fezzes down over their eyes.
C: HERDMASTER
D: Paw... ground! Everyone does a bull-like stomp and scrape.
C: HERDMASTER
D: All for Piltdown, bellow now! The room ECHOES with MOOSE-LIKE SNORTS.
C: HERDMASTER
D: All for Flintstone, bellow now!
N: Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull. Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around" desperately, hoping to hear one more snort. He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one more lonely snort... ... from Barney, of course.
C: HERDMASTER
D: Order furs! The fezzes come up.
C: HERDMASTER
D: The snorts have it! Brother Piltdown, it is my privilege to install you as the new Exalted Herdmaster Erect Antler and Big Buck of our Lodge. If you'll come forward, I will present you with the tokens of office. Cheers and applause as Piltdown goes to the podium.
C: FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY
D: Fred's a broken man. Barney moves over, puts his arm around him.
C: BARNEY
D: I voted for you, Fred.
C: FRED
D: Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place...! Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench. Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.
C: WIDER
D: Piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon, smiles at the group.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Thank you, Brother Chairman. Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few words. It's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101... which means that most of us aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. So my agenda for tonight... ends right now. There's a time to be a Buffalo... there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double-crossin' creep... All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.
C: PILTDOWN
D: ... and there's a time to stand up and be a man! So let's go down there and make the Slate shop into slate scrap... then we'll see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators of Neolithic 101! Meeting adjourned!
N: With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up. Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are slapped on. The Buffalo run out. When the dust clears, we see that only one member has avoided the herding instinct: Barney. Now, he turns, runs into -- BUFFALO LODGE - RECREATION AREA - NIGHT Fred is at the bar, opening a beer. He looks wistfully at the old, framed picture on the wall -- reacts as he sees -- PICTURE Even his childhood shot has been defaced. BACK TO SCENE He sets his jaw with a "screw 'em" expression, downs his beer. Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders.
C: BARNEY
D: Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big trouble -- !
C: FRED
D: No kidding. They rejected the best candidate --
C: BARNEY
D: No, no, not that! Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry! They're gonna wreck the assembly line!
C: FRED
D: Oh, no! That -- that's horrible! We could end up with half a percent of nothing!
E: genuinely worried pause
C: BARNEY
D: No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail!

D: I don't believe this... how did things ever get this out of hand -- ?
C: BARNEY
D: I know. Makes you wish things were back the way they were... before we was big executives.
C: FRED
D: Well, I wouldn't go that far... Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN. Fred looks back and sees --
C: FELDSPAR AND GRAVEL
D: Coming up from rear. Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he pulls abreast of Fred.
C: FELDSPAR
D: Flintstone! Pull over!
C: FRED
D: Oh, no, not now... Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder. Fred smiles, nods...
C: CLOSE ON FRED'S FEET
D: He slams them down through the floorboard --
C: WIDER
D: Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction. FELDSPAR
N: So astonished he follows this action with his head... a bad move because --
C: GRAVEL
D: Sarge! Look out -- ! NEW ANGLE
N: The patrol CAR runs off the road, CRASHING into a stone fire hydrant. Water squirts into the air. Feldspar and Gravel are drenched. They're just coming to their senses when the ground heaves -- the car's front wheels rise --
C: NEW ANGLE
D: As we see that the water spout is actually coming from the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of its head up from under the broken curb.
C: WHALE
D: I'm gonna sue you for everything you got --
T: CUT TO:
N: SLATE QUARRY - NIGHT Led by Piltdown, the workers have grabbed a big timber which they're using like a battering ram on the doors of the assembly line building. Suddenly, with a crash, the doors go down! Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the angry workers rush past them.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Now we'll show 'em who's boss!
E: loudly
C: PYRITE
D: They can't push us around! Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody juiced up, and then... when no one is looking... ... they slip out the back! REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop -- we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over, slam right through a storage area for crates and barrels which collapse all around them.
N: Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build- ing, knocking a hole in the wall. NEW ANGLE Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe... ... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir.
C: FRED
D: Barn! Did you see that -- ? -- Huh, now it's gone... I coulda sworn...
E: double-taking peering through the dust
C: BARNEY
D: Come on Fred. Time to earn those big bucks.
N: They rush into the plant.
S: INT. ASSEMBLY LINE - NIGHT
N: As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and Pyrite reappear.
C: PYRITE
D: Darn that Flintstone and Rubble... they're gonna screw everything up...
C: PILTDOWN
D: Not if we give 'em a nice long vacation... in the hospital. Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour- aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below. CLOSE - PYRITE
N: Winds up for another baseball-type swing -- but as he follows through, the ball-shaped light fixture jerks up on its cable. Unable to stop in time, Pyrite spins around, falls on his ass. Barney drops down INTO VIEW, hanging horizontally from the rafters. He's holding the light fixture with his free hand.
C: BARNEY
D: Stee-rike one! Heh-hey. Ready for a curve ball?
N: Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand, he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. He pulls down on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again. Puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another see-saw motion... ... This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and peers under the beam...
C: NEW ANGLE
D: Fred is hanging on the other end.
C: FRED
D: Brother Piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler?
N: Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.
C: FRED
D: Guess not... Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase after Fred.
C: BARNEY AND PYRITE
D: Square off in the rafters.
C: BARNEY
D: Give me your best shot. Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens. Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...
N: ... but this time the window is hinged in the center and the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.
C: FRED
D: Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super- structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him.
C: FRED
D: Dare you to cross that line.
N: Piltdown crosses it.
C: FRED
D: That line.
N: Piltdown crosses it. Fred "marks" another one. Piltdown doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step. Oops. Bad idea: The last "line" was at the edge of a straight drop! Piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of Fred's clothing! Both men fall -- at the last minute Piltdown catches a ladder! BELOW - ASSEMBLY LINE Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to form the Fibre products! Worse, the impact arouses the goatasauruses out of their sleep. Dutifully, they rise, and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is struggling to his feet! Fred's yell is muffled by the clay.
C: OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS
D: Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do their job. Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough: The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.
C: FRED
D: is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay. THE FIBRE MOLD
N: shudders -- and shakes out a Fibre statue of... Fred!
C: BELOW
D: The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the mat again! A moment later, another "Fred" drops down beside him.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Has descended the ladder, hopping mad. Now, he sees Fred coming toward him... Piltdown breaks a big lever off the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "FRED" SHATTERS.
N: FRED Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to "tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he tries to move... can't!
C: PILTDOWN
D: Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the next one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one... CUT TO:
N: UP ABOVE - BARNEY Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea, he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber stamp. Pyrite comes around the corner... Barney's head butts him in the gut, dodges under his legs! Then, as Pyrite stumbles, Barney stamps his ass with the word "REJECT." Pyrite looks back, sees this, reddens... raises his club.
C: PYRITE
D: Reject, huh? Whaddya say we reject your head? He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the club, howls --
C: WIDER
D: The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked REJECTS -- and drops him. Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective Fibrerock goods.
C: BARNEY
D: Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --
N: BELOW Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor towards -- THE END OF THE BUILDING where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel!
C: FELDSPAR
D: All right! You're all under arr --
N: Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete with appropriate sound.
C: BARNEY
D: Whattya know. Even got the spare again...
E: sitting up
N: Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off! Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROCK POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Wooden bars delineate the holding cells. "Wanted" posters of stone are hanging on the walls. As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk.
C: BETTY
D: Barney, I don't understand... what came over you boys?
C: EXITING BUFFALO
D: 'Night, Barney. So long, fatso. BUFFALO #2 See ya, Barn. Flintstone, you're dead meat. BUFFALO #2 'Night, pal. 'Night, slimeball.
E: to Fred pause
C: WILMA
D: Fred, is there something you want to tell me about the lodge meeting?
C: FRED
D: I don't wanna talk about it. Besides, who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads? I'm more of a country club guy myself anyway...
N: He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred out, puzzled.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Lava stands in the shadows beside his Porscherock. Piltdown and Pyrite are with him. In the b.g., Fred and Wilma drive away.
C: LAVA
D: A simple little heist -- I gave you everything but the keys and you blew it --
C: PILTDOWN
D: Hey, we got the union guys to break in and create a distraction, didn't we? Who knew Flintstone and Rubble would show up, too?
C: LAVA
D: The day after Slate City opens there's going to be an audit. If the stuff isn't gone by then we'll all be doing time until the Bronze Age.
C: PYRITE
D: Don't worry, Mister Lava... we're on top of it. They both turn and start down an alley... jamming together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.
C: BARNEY
D: Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix.
C: LAVA
D: How do you know that? I mean... ah, why do you say that?
E: thrown recovering
C: BARNEY
D: It tastes different.
C: LAVA
D: Tastes... different?
C: BARNEY
D: Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff --
E: smacking his lips
C: LAVA
D: Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway?
C: BARNEY
D: Nine days, Mister Lava.
C: LAVA
D: Jumping Jurrasic, no wonder you're so run down.
N: He puts his arm around Barney, leads him towards the car where Betty is waiting.
C: LAVA
D: I'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, Rubble. Starting tomorrow. You can catch some rays, maybe invent something... hey, how about Fibrerock, the sequel, part II -- ?
C: BARNEY
D: But --
C: LAVA
D: No, don't try and thank me.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of Slate City. It's even more grandiose than its predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge office buildings beside it, and then a convention center beyond that.
C: LAVA
D: ... As you can see, the Fibrerock is so light we're using it for construction, for furnishings... for everything. You can't stack a two-bedroom cave this high... but the sky's the limit with Fibrerock!
C: SLATE
D: 'Sky's the limit'... 'sky's the limit'... why, these two buildings, they... they practically scrape the sky! We should call them... Slate scrapers!
C: LAVA
D: That's brilliant, Unc... Mister Slate. In fact, maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex... ... I wanna call 'em the FibreSphere and the '____' something Needle... but I just can't...
E: indicating the convention center
C: SLATE
D: How about, 'Slate Needle'?
E: modestly
C: LAVA
D: 'Slate Need...' ... How do you keep coming up with these? It's uncanny.
E: astonished
C: SLATE
D: It's a gift...
E: shrugging
C: LAVA
D: Oh, that reminds me, sign these, will you... just a few overruns ... minor cost problems... that's it... thank you...
E: casually
N: Slate's so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly listens to what Lava's saying, just runs his stylus through the wet clay of the statements, meanwhile "framing" the model city in his hands.
C: LAVA
D: ... Oh, Mister Slate, we're going to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent Show in the uh, 'Slate Needle.' Good for public relations -- Lava breaks off. He's just looked out the window and seen --
E: heading for the door
N: LAVA'S POV - QUARRY BELOW WINDOW A small figure appears behind some of the equipment, tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards the assembly line. Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is Barney! LAVA Looks around, spots Piltdown and Pyrite, now resplendent in security guard uniforms. Lava whistles softly to get their attention, can't. Then he sees one of Slate's golf trophies. He shrugs, throws it. BELOW - PILTDOWN Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite in tow. BARNEY Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the massive bulk of --
C: PILTDOWN
D: -- who looks down at him with a big smile, Pyrite at his side.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Can we help you... sir?
C: BARNEY
D: Ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... I'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian...
E: fake crotchety voice
C: PYRITE
D: Our pleasure. Then they grab Barney with such force that the THERMOS drops and SHATTERS, drag him O.S. -- SLATE QUARRY - MAIN GATE - DAY
N: Barney is tossed outside, landing in a heap amidst the picketing workers of Neolithic 101.
C: PILTDOWN
D: Ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants! Still laughing, Piltdown and Pyrite cross over to Lava, who has come out of the office building.
E: chuckling
C: LAVA
D: That takes care of the half-pint. Now to deal with the half-wit. CUT TO: INT. LAVA'S OFFICE - DAY Lava walks Fred from the door into the color-coordinated high-style room.
E: pause
C: FRED
D: ... But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam --
E: on the move
C: LAVA
D: -- Oh? Or check up on us? Emotionally, Lava turns, indicates a picture of Slate on the wall.
E: pointedly
C: LAVA
D: Flintstone, that... that's a slap in the face of our founder... our employer... our uncle. Unless, of course, you agree with Rubble... that Mister Slate isn't capable of running this operation ... that I'm not capable of running it?
E: turning back, another tone
C: FRED
D: Of course not, Mister Lava. But --
E: nervous
C: LAVA
D: Call me Jerry. Sit down, please... Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says --
C: LAVA
D: ... Cigar?
E: offering one
C: FRED
D: Why, yeah, sure, Jerry.
C: LAVA
D: Fred, let me get to the bottom slime. Some men -- you and me, for instance -- we're cut out for the big time, the big bucks... ... the big everything. Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars. He puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk.
E: eyeing Fred's girth
N: CLOSER - GIZMO It's actually a frame supporting a little LIZARD. The Lizard bites the tip off the cigar, practically chokes on it, finally manages to spit it out with difficulty.
C: LIZARD
D: When they say smoking is bad for your health, they're not kidding...
E: aside
C: BACK TO SCENE LAVA
D: And others? Wellll...
N: Now Lava takes out a lighter, leans across the desk. CLOSER - LIGHTER As Lava works the mechanism, two wooden twigs rub rapidly across each other and ignite. BACK TO SCENE
C: LAVA
D: ... Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock...
C: FRED
D: Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say...
C: LAVA
D: Yes?
C: FRED
D: ... Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of --
C: LAVA
D: You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what I like about you. But you're a big guy with a big decision to make. Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire... or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties?
E: giving Fred a playful punch
C: FRED
D: Well, gee, that's tough one -- -- Uh, what are my important duties?
E: pause
C: LAVA
D: Publicity, Flintstone, publicity!
E: MORE
C: LAVA
D: And that's why I've got a little surprise for you... for the man who made Fibrerock a household word, I want you to meet the man who's going to make you a household word...
E: CONT'D
N: Lava throws the door open. Fred's jaw drops as he sees --
C: FRED
D: R-rockin' Leach? Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands.
C: LEACH
D: 'Ello, Fred. I've 'eard a lot h'about you from Mister Lava. H'at's why we're going to put you on our program.
C: FRED
D: M-me? On -- on television?
C: LAVA
D: Right, Fred. As long as you forget all this nonsense about Barney.
E: patting his back, sotto
C: FRED
D: Barney who?
E: still in a dazed thrill
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - DAY
N: Three big dino-mounted trucks are parked in front. You have to read the words on all three: "ROCKSTYLES OF..." "THE RICH..." "AND FAMOUS." Technicians roll out gear, set up big spotlights, etc. CLOSER - YARD Rockin' Leach is surveying the place with an aide. Fred and Wilma are with them. Leach makes a "frame" with his hands, "pans" the area.
C: LEACH
D: Hmm. Lovely little guest 'ouse, Mister Flintstone. So simple, so ordinary, so unexceptional... why, h'it's almost quaint. Let's say we start with the camera 'ere, except...
N: Leach breaks off, looks over the fence at the Rubble homestead. He shakes his head sadly.
C: FRED
D: W-what's wrong?
C: LEACH
D: Well, just look at that yard over there... barbecues and trikes, not exactly the right image...
C: FRED
D: Maybe you could move those plants to block them out...?
E: pointing
C: LEACH
D: Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin' with those greens. The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over.
C: WILMA
D: Fred, this was supposed to be a 'typical evening' at the Flintstones, and you invited fifty people I don't even know. Now what's going on? Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses?
C: FRED
D: It's the Rubble yard, Wilma. It's just not the right image... He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure. BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Betty, hair and face done, but still in a slip, is putting a reluctant Bam-Bam into a cute little blazer. In the f.g., Barney finishes tying a black tie, then struggles into a dinner jacket.
C: BETTY
D: I don't know why you want to go to this thing... after the way Fred's been treating you lately --
C: BARNEY
D: Fred's in a high-powered executive job, Betty. There's a lot of pressure on him.
C: BETTY
D: Yeah... and it's all around his belt. If it wasn't for poor Wilma I wouldn't give him the Geological Time --
C: BARNEY
D: Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred. Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING. Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see -- THEIR POV - THE FENCE The television crew has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until Barney and Betty are in shadow. Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.
T: CUT TO:
N: QUICK CUTS - FLINTSTONE YARD - ANGLE ON "KLEIG LIGHTS" Inside each one, a little BIRD in hardhat and smoked visor lights up the arc, gets knocked on his butt when it catches.
C: BIRD
D: I've heard of a flash in the pan, but this is ridiculous...
E: slowly getting up
N: ON DINO He's squirming uncomfortably under the attentions of two crew members who are busy with scissors and combs and brushes. Finally, they're done and leave him. He has been cut and trimmed like a French poodle. He gets a glimpse of himself in the swimming pool and freaks out. Then he arches his back, shakes out the hairstyle. CLOSER ON ROCKIN' LEACH The MAIN TITLE of the show can be heard O.S.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And now... the man who brings you the romance and excitement you crave... from the casinos of Monte Carlrock to the glamour of Hollyrock, here's your guide to the Rockstyles of the Rich and Famous, Rockin' Leach! Leach takes his cue from the director --
E: O.S.

Tonight we come to you live from the ah... charming pied a terre of the man of the 'our, Fred Flintstone -- Leach pauses, hearing the sound of someone CHIPPING AWAY at a stone tablet... he looks up at -- HIS POV - FRED He has just carved "FREDERICK" into a stone cue card and points to it.

C: WILMA
D: Thank heaven. There isn't one person I know here.
C: BARNEY
D: You mean beside Fred?
C: WILMA
D: I mean including Fred. They look over at --
C: THE SET
D: Where Leach has pulled Fred on camera. Fred is posing, fluffing his ascot, etc. We notice a "FVF" embroidered patch on his jacket.
C: LEACH
D: Frederick, of course, is the man behind Fibrerock -- the invention that some predict will revolutionize life in the future. Frederick, 'ow does it feel to know that you 'ave personally brought the Stone Age as we know it to a long-deserved end?
C: FRED
D: Well, Rockin', you're right, I have affected destiny for all mankind, and it's a sobering thought. However, if I may add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all the credit for Fibrerock...
E: very affected accent
C: WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY
D: react with hopeful expressions --
C: BARNEY
D: See? What'd I tell ya?
E: sotto, to them
C: BACK TO SCENE FRED
D: No, I could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person. I'm speaking, of course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O. of Slate Construction... WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY

CLOSE ON "SLATE NEEDLE" AND FIBRESPHERE Both decorated in pennants and bunting, connected to each other by a gangway six stories up. Block letters on the Fibresphere proclaim "Slate Construction brings you THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF FIBRE." A heroic statue of Slate himself stands close by the structures. (Sphere and needle, of course, are dead on parodies of the Trylon and Perisphere, centerpieces of the '39 World's Fair.) A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up. Mr. and Mrs. Slate and Lava, and Lava's son, POINDEXTER, get out. It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn hasn't fallen far from the tree.
C: POINDEXTER
D: Wow! Is this ever keen! Dad, you promise I can cut in all the lines?
C: LAVA
D: Of course, Poindexter, of course. They head for the mastodon and pully-powered elevator. Standing there are Piltdown and Pyrite, both in security guard uniforms. . Lava gives them a big look. They nod. As the elevator rises, his two cronies duck into a stairwell marked "NO ADMITTANCE."

E: coming over concerned
C: FRED
D: You mean you can see their house -- ?
E: alarmed
C: WILMA
D: I mean you're treating them horribly! What's come over you, Fred? Does a little money mean so much to you that you just turn your back on the things that really count?
E: exasperated
C: FRED
D: Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success...

C: LEACH
D: Fabulous! I've 'ad enough crab meat and crabgrass to last me a year. All right, boys, that's a wrap!

D: In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're oblivious to him.
C: FRED
D: ... Yas, yas, it's a challenging commodity market these days. Personally, I'm considering petrified forests, but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha...
N: Suddenly Fred notices that his "audience" has evaporated. He looks around, sees everyone headed for their cars, the TV crew packing up, etc.
C: FRED
D: ... Hey, whoa, what's happening --
C: LEACH'S AIDE
D: What's happening isn't happening here. The action's over at Slate City. Oh, thanks for the booze, Ed --
C: FRED
D: Fred! He stumbles through the thinning crowd, clutching at elbows.
C: FRED
D: Hey, what's the hurry? We got a cake shaped like a piece of Fibrerock... I got it, how about some charades? No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes up to him.
C: WILMA
D: Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not working out... Fred turns, puts on a big smile.
C: FRED
D: Whaddya mean, not working out? They're goin' party hopping, that's all. That's what ya do in society, Wilma... you cruise around. They'll go over to Slate's shindig for a while, then they'll come back here.
C: WILMA
D: Fred...
C: FRED
D: You go on over to Slate City, okay?
C: WILMA
D: Fred, I want to be here with you --
C: FRED
D: Nah, me and some of the guys from the country club, we're gonna play poker, yeah, big stakes poker until everybody comes back. Go on with the others. The kids got their show to put on anyway... and I wouldn't want people to think... to think the Flintstones were party poopers.
N: She doesn't know what to say, or what she can say that won't shatter his shaky image. She sighs, kisses him, then calls out.
C: WILMA
D: Come on, Pebbles. We're going to another party.
C: PEBBLES
D: Will there be real food there?
C: WILMA
D: We'll find out together. She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.
C: BETTY
D: Wilma, wait. I'm going with you.
C: WILMA
D: Why?
C: BETTY
D: If friends can't do something stupid, who can? Wilma smiles, touched.
C: BETTY
D: Besides... ... Maybe if we leave the boys alone...?
E: lowering her voice
N: Wilma nods, hopeful.
S: EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The film crew caravan is already leaving as Wilma, Betty and the kids get into the Rubble car. The last TV crew- man extinguishes the big spotlight. The house is dark, forlorn in the fading twilight. REAR OF YARD - NIGHT Fred sits forlorn in the rubble of his party. Dino comes over, nuzzles his leg.
C: FRED
D: Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend.
N: He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's car and drive away. FRED sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "FVF" patch. He suddenly rips it off in a fury. Then he looks at -- THE WALL IN FRONT OF BARNEY'S PROPERTY
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening. Then he grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters; the potted plants go flying.
C: FRED
D: His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with dirt... then he sees -- NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE -- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --
C: FRED
D: B... Barney?
E: disbelieving
C: BARNEY
D: Hiya, Fred. Boy, the rental place is gonna be mad... ... You feeling better, pal?
E: moving closer noticing his ruined tuxedo eyeing the mess
C: FRED
D: 'Pal'? How can you call me that? Barney, I... I've been such a... such a... such a...
C: BARNEY
D: Creep?
C: FRED
D: Well, yeah. But more of a --
C: BARNEY
D: Fool?
E: helpful tone
C: FRED
D: Well --
C: BARNEY
D: Slimeball? Louse? Jackass? Stuck-up blimpasaurus?
E: snapping fingers
C: FRED
D: Barney... can... can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk?
E: wincing, but taking it
C: BARNEY
D: Sure, Fred. I've had lots of practice.
E: stepping closer smiling
C: FRED
D: Aw, Barn... And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two prehistoric sensitive guys. CUT TO:

N: FIBRESPHERE & SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT Little cupola cars are chugging around the upper level of the Fibresphere, where they enter a tunnel-like open- ing labeled "THE WORLD OF FIBRE." Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino are in one of these. Now, we FOLLOW them as they chug into -- THE FIBRESPHERE "WORLD OF FIBRE" RIDE The cupolas rattle along in Disneyland style, passing a sign which reads: "FIBREROCK--TRANSFORMING THE HOME." Here, mechanical figures in an all-Fibre home move klutzily around the room.
C: RECORDING
D: Welcome! Welcome to the fabulous world of tomorrow... a world brought to you by Fibrerock!
E: V.O. a la 'The Great Gildersleeve'
C: REVERSE ANGLE
D: REVEALING that behind the hollow shells of the human family is a veritable family of monkeys, all working the figures like puppets. A PARROT at a stand-mounted microphone is giving the narration.
C: PARROT
D: Here, we see a typical family of the future, free of the cares and worries of today... yes, the great kibble crisis is a thing of the past when you're living the good life... the Fibrelife! NEXT EXHIBIT
E: RECORDING V.O.
N: The CARS CHUG past a display of tree trunks, leaves, bubbling gunk... and those iridescent vegetable pearls we've come to know... coo-coo berries. Iron bars and vault-like doors separate the coo-coo berries from the other items.
C: ANOTHER PARROT
D: Here, gathered from the four corners of the globe, are the secret ingredients of Fibrerock... some common, some rare... all making life easier for you and yours! THIRD EXHIBIT
N: The little CARS CHUG into an elegant salon, complete with runway. There's another PARROT here in front of another megaphone, but this parrot is chic and flamboyant.
C: FASHION PARROT
D: But does Fibrerock belong only in the kitchen, the garage, the workplace? No, no, no, my darlings!
C: FASHION MODELS ON RUNWAY
D: As each girl struts forward, she shrugs off a bulky animal fur and tosses it into a garbage can. Underneath are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend of the future and retro .
E: that is, prehistoric retro
C: FASHION PARROT
D: Because the clothes of the Stone Age are as extinct as stones themselves! Yes, thanks to the wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world of high fashion will be totally transformed... by Fibre furs... Fibre frocks... Fibre foundations and Fibreshoes... it's to die for!
C: FOURTH EXHIBIT
D: Now, we see a display of Fibrerock props of all kinds -- appliances, toys, tools, etc... all of it upstaged by a choir consisting of every animal, bird and critter we've seen in this film. Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino ooh and ahh with the other guests as the mechanical animals all sing in unison --
C: FIBRE CHOIR
D: 'It's a Fibre World you know, It's a Fibre World you know, It's a Fibre World you know -- ' CUT TO: INT. BARNEY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and are singing. FRED & BARNEY 'Now it's time to do or die, grab that rock and kick it high, let's fight, fight, fight for Bedrock High!'
E: V.O.
N: They break up laughing. Fred chuckles, looks at one of the many old photographs strewn around.
C: FRED
D: Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it.
N: NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PHOTO The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and Barney in their cheerleading costumes. Barney has a sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like "mascot" costume. He's holding the hideously-sculpted head under his arm.
C: BARNEY
D: Yeah. Too bad we never made the team.
C: FRED
D: So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes?
C: BARNEY
D: You know Betty. She never throws anything away. He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it. There they are.
C: FRED
D: Boy. Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem.
E: rummaging in it
C: FRED
D: Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries...
N: Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like head. He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and forward.
C: BARNEY
D: Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party? Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync.
C: FRED
D: What for? So him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us?
E: echo-y
N: Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his direction.
C: FRED
D: All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile --
E: echo-y
N: Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.
C: FRED
D: -- Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us.
E: normal voice
C: BARNEY
D: Yeah? When did you notice that?
C: FRED
D: About an hour ago.
C: BARNEY
D: Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred. Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart.
N: Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush over to the model. It's the interim version we saw earlier. CLOSER - MODEL The decomposition continues, walls and supports turning into sand and running down before our eyes. In a Rube Goldberg-like continuum, the little houses go first, falling like dominoes...
C: FRED
D: Wha... what's happening?
N: Barney tries to stop the process, can't.
C: BARNEY
D: I... I don't know... the Fibrerock it's... it's decomposing... but this shouldn't happen...
C: FRED
D: Your old models are just fine...
C: ANGLE
D: Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days are rock solid. BACK TO SCENE
C: BARNEY
D: It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.
C: BARNEY
D: -- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it!
E: snapping his fingers
C: FRED
D: What's it?
C: BARNEY
D: Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!
C: FRED
D: But.. why would --
C: BARNEY
D: Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy --
C: FRED
D: -- Not 'somebody' -- Lava!
C: BARNEY
D: Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together -- !
E: alarmed
C: FRED
D: Then... what's happening here...
E: with mounting concern
C: BARNEY
D: ... Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate City!
E: finishing it
C: FRED
D: Oh no... Barney! Wilma and Betty -- and the kids -- they're all there -- With a final WHIMPER, the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES, model story by model story. Finally the "DISK" on top of the needle is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.
C: FRED
D: -- B-barney... what do we do?
E: worried
N: Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.
C: BARNEY
D: Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance! Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of the model "Slate City"... CUT TO:
S: INT. SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT
N: WIDEN FROM a young kid who is drinking a glass of water and simultaneously singing with a ventriloquist's dummy. Obviously, the talent show has begun. In the audience, Lava fidgets with nervous and confident energy... gives Wilma a big look.
C: LAVA
D: You're certainly looking lovely this evening, Mrs. Flintstone. Life with a junior executive must agree with you.
C: WILMA
D: Uh... thank you... I think.
C: LAVA
D: Yes. I think so, too. Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive.
E: looking into her eyes smiling
C: WILMA
D: Oh? Is Fred getting promoted? Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge.
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: Sank you, ladies and gentlemen. An' sank you, Monsieur Slate for zis lovely setting. Zoot alors, zis will ze mos' fantas'tic recital in Bedrock 'istoree. Now, I would like to sank out mos' generous benefactress, Madame Slate for her fine support o'vair zee years -- She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands, waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother.
E: as applause dies
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: -- An' now, what better introduction could we 'ave for Mrs. Slate's vairy own gran' nephew... Poindexter Lava! She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter. He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins to play:

E: singing loudly
N: QUICK SHOTS - AUDIENCE Their smiles become fixed. (Up on the spotlights, the little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their ears.) In the wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam, DINO MOANS, hides his head under his paws. On the refreshment table, GLASSES CRACK... a cake falls. CLOSE ON LAVA He surreptitiously checks his wrist watch...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EMPTY FIBRERIDE - TIGHT ON ANOTHER WATCH - NIGHT
N: This one a pocket job. (Like Lava's, it's really a little sundial with a built-in burning match above it to provide a shadow!) We WIDEN, and see that this watch is held in a green, scaley claw. ANOTHER ANGLE It's the xenosaurus, lurking behind the exhibits! Now, the CREATURE GRUNTS confidently, lights up a cigar. Then it picks up a canvas bag and a big toolbox and tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the Fibre ride.

N: Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.
C: FRED
D: What'll we do when we get there?
C: BARNEY
D: We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops!
E: holds up the flit gun
N: He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun, the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume, and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."
C: FRED
D: Barney -- ! -- I can't see straight --
E: swerving all over the road
N: Barney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one hand and the monster head with the other.
C: BARNEY
D: Hang on, hang on --
N: Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand, tries to help Fred with the other.
S: EXT. CAR - NIGHT

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. "ROCKDONALD'S" RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: "Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig- atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind them proudly reads "OVER 100 SOLD.")
C: FELDSPAR
D: Speed traps again! Face it, Gravel. I'm in a rut... and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me, they're all big shots now: Sam Slate... Dirty Harock... Magma, P.I. And you know why? 'Cause they got the breaks, that's why!
E: mouth full, bitching
N: Suddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING TIRES and HONKING HORNS. They look out their window at -- FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face inside the jaws of the monster mask.)
C: BACK TO SCENE GRAVEL
D: S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some sorta creature was attacking that little guy -- !
C: FELDSPAR
D: There's a lesson there, Gravel... never pick up hitchhikers. Besides -- -- Did you say 'creature'?
E: realizing
N: They do a big double-take at the now-vanishing car. FELDSPAR & GRAVEL The xenosaurus! Excited, Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a DISPATCH PARAKEET in a police uniform pops INTO VIEW. Feldspar grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone.
C: FELDSPAR
D: This is a xenosaurus alert. Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The creature has been sighted on the Slate City exit of the Venturock Freeway! It is driving a brown late model sedan and eating a white male Caucasian. Car twelve is in hot pursuit. He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away, but gives him a look.
C: FELDSPAR
D: Oh, yeay... over and out!
E: remembering
N: The bird nods, appeased, flies off.
C: DISPATCH PARAKEET
D: Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way. Car Twelve is on the way...
E: as it goes

D: Gravel, this could mean promotions for both of us! Load the shotgun and turn on the siren!
E: thrilled trotting up to speed
N: FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING Barney is rocking Fred's head back and forth, finally gives it one last mighty yank. Something breaks. Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car. Fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head. It rattles. When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth no longer opens and closes in sync.
C: FRED
D: Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit, Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore! Suddenly both men react to an approaching SIREN. They both look back at --

N: SLATE CITY - REAR GATE A fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the distance, we can see the dark Slate Scrapers, and past them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and Slate Needle. We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE." The fence collapses all around the car.
C: NEW ANGLE
D: Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact.

E: checking notes
N: PEBBLES, BAM-BAM & DINO poised in the stances we recognize as the "first positions" of the "Dino Dance." However, whereas the previous version of this was done impromptu and a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw hats alone, this time the kids and Dino are fully costumed, with sequins, batons and the like, and the dance is completely choreographed.
C: KIDS

D: As the Dino dance begins, FULL ORCHESTRATION OVER IT. The audience seems to really like it -- all except --

C: MUSIC DIES. HEADMISTRESS
D: Madame Slate, what ees wrong -- ?
C: MRS. SLATE
D: I'll tell you what's wrong! This 'act' is an absolute disgrace! This is supposed to be a talent show! And a pedestrian animal act like this belongs in a circus!
N: WILMA AND BETTY React, furious, jump out of their seats.
C: BETTY
D: A circus, huh? Well, if our kids belong in a circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his --
C: WILMA
D: Yeah -- a zoo where the animals are dead -- because if they aren't, they will be!
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Why, how dare you! Mrs. Flintstein, I'll have you know that my little Poindexter has been trained by the finest tutors! Poindexter! Show them! Encore!
N: The kid jumps up, begins to play. Immediately another GLASS SHATTERS. But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK, and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one by one.
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Ah... Poindexter... that's enough ... Poindexter...?
E: alarmed
N: The kids stops... But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES. Then one of the tables collapses. Pause. Every head in the room swivels around and stares at Poindexter. Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside. But the destruction continues: Another WINDOW PANEL SHATTERS. Then, the entire building shakes.
C: SLATE
D: Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava for support, ends up pulling him down, too. Slate gets to his knees and looks out the window... and his jaw drops in astonishment. HIS POV - SLATE CITY
N: In the distance, with a CRACKLING ROAR, the little rows of Fibrerock tract houses are falling like dominoes in a wave that is rolling toward the Slate Needle. SLATE CITY DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT A flashlight beam rakes the CAMERA. Feldspar, shotgun in one hand, light in the other, looks around cautiously. (The shotgun has a slingshot mechanism; the flashlight is a mirror-backed candle.) Behind him, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH. Feldspar tenses, but it's --
C: GRAVEL
D: No sign of the driver...
C: FELDSPAR
D: You kidding? By now he's a couple of shinbones and a belch. Gravel drops down on one knee, excited. He shines his light on Fred's big "clawprints."

D: Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep these tracks are! That xeno thing must weigh a ton! They aim their lights at the tracks, begin to follow them. Suddenly they round a corner and come face to face with -- NEW ANGLE - FRED
N: He's stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with the monster head again. Now, he freezes in twin flash- light beams!

C: FRED
D: Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now.

As he stumbles, Barney leaps on Fred's back, catches the cable! As Barney starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles!

The impact has knocked Fred's monster mask back on his head! Fred mutters angrily... Barney starts to help... and then they both notice that there's another monstrous head in the middle of their group! There're big "takes" all around, and then the xenosaurus leaps out of the tangle of bodies, treads air, and runs away!

N: It's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus, which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred- ibly long neck. The bony plates on the creature's back make perfect stairs. However, the creature is noticeably listless and uncooperative.
C: FIRE CHIEF
D: Come on, come on, what's the hold up -- ?
C: FIREFIGHTER
D: It's the kibble crisis, sir -- the firesauruses have been on half-rations for a month! Above them, the BUILDING SHUDDERS again.
C: IN THE SLATE NEEDLE
D: Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads.
C: WILMA
D: Fred! There's a fire hose -- !
E: pointing
N: Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and
T: cuts them off.
N: Helpless, they step back. With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here ... rolls up to Slate's feet. Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it: Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of --
C: GRACE
D: -- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little animal print undies. BETTY
N: In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns Bam-Bam's face away from this display.
C: BAM-BAM
D: D-dad, are we gonna be okay?
C: BARNEY
D: Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred?
E: pause; false smile
C: FRED
D: Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
N: He's started yelping because he's realized his arm is on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin beating at the arm with anything in their hands, and then Fred suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with a small flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas stage magician.
C: FRED
D: -- Wait a minute -- I don't feel anything at all --
N: With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames, and then confidentially snuffs it out.
C: BARNEY
D: It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten.
N: Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
C: BARNEY
D: -- Okay?
E: rapping on the head
C: FRED
D: Hist hust fine! He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the amber GLASS --
C: IN THE BOX
D: A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside, SNORING.
E: Note to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is not quite a snake: it has little vestigial forepaws the better to emote with. Right now the snoring head is in those little paws.
N: The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say "one moment." Then the pythonsaurus turns his head towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps loudly. We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away...
C: IN THE MAIN ROOM
D: Everyone retreats from the fire. Slate picks up the head of the statue, his only souvenir.
C: WITH FRED
D: Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns and runs back into the other room. Water shoots out of the creature's mouth. WIDER
E: Behind him, yards and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart- ment behind the box.
N: Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of flame in the room. All the guests cheer, rush forward and slap Fred on the back. Pebbles jumps up on him and kisses him.
C: FRED
D: Hit fuzz nudding... wheely... The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.
C: PYTHONSAURUS
D: Hey, what am I, chopped liver?
C: BARNEY
D: Come on, everybody -- we'll go out the way we came! Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere.
C: POINDEXTER
D: Outta the way -- outta the way -- women and children first -- ! I mean, ah, children and women first, yeah, yeah, provided that uh, there's room for the women...
E: pushing and shoving
N: Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his costume) a big look up and down, looks TOWARD the CAMERA.
C: PYTHONSAURUS
D: Hey, not bad. Wonder if she lives around here.
N: Just then Fred tilts back the monster head. The pythonsaurus reacts.
C: PYTHONSAURUS
D: Heartbreaker!
N: Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate Needle completely collapses.
S: EXT. FIBRESPHERE - LONG SHOT
N: The Slate Needle tumbles down, taking a big chunk of the Fibresphere with it! But the rest of the huge globe stays put... for now. RESCUE WORKERS BELOW gasp, cry out --
C: UP ABOVE
D: Already the first partygoers are sliding down the elevator cable.
C: HEADMISTRESS
D: Oh, geez, we're all gonna croak -- I neva shoulda left Far Rockaway -- Wilma gives her a big suspicious look -- blanching, the Headmistress slides down the cable --
E: panicking
C: BELOW
D: The rescue teams catch the people in nets as they hit the ground. ABOVE
N: Barney gives the dwindling circle of solid Fibre around the group another shot of coo-coo juice. Poindexter Lava pushes his way forward.
C: POINDEXTER
D: Fifty clams for a piggy-back ride ... a hundred clams!
E: to anyone and everyone
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Do you see that, Jerry? Do you see how my great-nephew is behaving at this moment of crisis?
E: aghast
C: LAVA
D: Yeah. Real chip off the old block, ain't he? Embarrassed, Mrs. Slate grabs the kid by the neck, practically throws him at the cable. She follows him down, followed by Lava and Mr. Slate. REAR OF FLEEING PEOPLE
E: proudly
N: Fred and Barney have bravely held up the rear, their families clutching to them. Barney's carrying Bam-Bam.
C: FRED
D: Upsy-daisy, sweetheart -- piggy back time! She jumps on his back... slamming the monster head back in place.
E: to Pebbles
C: FRED
D: Hohh... GWEAT!
E: resigned
C: BARNEY
D: Go on, honey... I got Bam-Bam!
E: to Betty
C: BETTY
D: Barney... tonight you're the biggest man in Bedrock.
N: She kisses him, slides down. CLOSE ON WILMA AND FRED Backlit romantically by the flames, just like Gable and Leigh when Atlanta burned.
C: FRED
D: Wilmagh, I jusght whunt to sagh thad I knogh shumtimes I dogh dumb thinks... Bhut hit's becaughse high luff yough sogh much thaght high whant yough to livgh likge a pwincess orgh a qween 'cause you reaally arggh rugg aaggg hummmmg higga!
E: through the mask
C: WILMA
D: Oh, Fred -- that's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard! They kiss... she drops to safety...!
N: BELOW Wilma slides into a rescue net, gets on unsteady feet next to Betty.
C: BACK UPSTAIRS FRED
D: Lhet's dogh it!
N: Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake... both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining structure collapses!
C: BELOW
D: Everyone reacts in horror -- ABOVE
N: Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the ground!
C: CLOSER
D: Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do. BELOW
N: Wilma and Betty gasp... what can be done? THE SECOND ISLAND Bricks and chunks of Fibre stir... a form sits up... it's -- Dino! He looks around at the situation, becomes agitated... he wants to help... but how?
C: WILMA AND BETTY
D: Suddenly become inspired.
C: BETTY
D: W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo... those wires... do you think -- ?
C: WILMA
D: Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try it -- ! Dino! Dino, look down here -- !
C: DINO
D: Obeys, puzzled --
N: HIS POV - WILMA AND BETTY Amazingly, they grab scraps of wood, borrow fire fighter's helmets, and begin to do a buck and wing.
C: WILMA AND BETTY
D: You can keep the twist, the frug and hop I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop -- BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends. ANOTHER ANGLE
N: Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then --
C: LONG SHOT
D: -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as Wilma and Betty wind up!
C: WILMA AND BETTY
D: Yes, I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop 'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin' THE IGNEOUS ROCK!
C: FRED
D: rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up... suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up and sees -- HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS
N: All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys. Feldspar is at the head of the group. He cocks his shotgun. The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch menacingly --
C: FELDSPAR
D: It's the xenosaurus -- stand back, men -- it's a vicious killer -- Ready -- Aim --
C: FRED
D: High ham noght a zenosore! High ham hay hooman beeng -- ! BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface. CLOSE - FRED Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes! He's back in the line of fire! DINO
E: with desperate poignancy
N: Flanked by Wilma, Barney and the kids, who are shouting for the police to stop, only Dino the wonder bronto has the wits to act! "YI-YI-YI-ING," he races forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING -- and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's monster suit and -- de-pants him! Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now revealed striped undershorts.
C: WIDER
D: Pause.
N: Then Officer Gravel takes a good look at that rear end.
C: GRAVEL
D: Hey, those are the biggest shorts I've ever seen... ... It... it must be Mister Flintstone! Cease fire! Gee, Sarge, now you don't have to shoot him -- !
E: realizing to Feldspar
N: Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns. (Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles it away from his superior.) THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN Safe, they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers Dino's affection. (In the b.g., a police car holding Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava is chasing the car.)
C: POINDEXTER
D: Dad! Dad! Can I use the Porscherock while you're in the slammer? Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug.
E: distant
C: SLATE
D: Flintstone. Rubble. I... I don't know what to say. I... I treated you horribly... I ignored you, abused you... and then you come here and risk your necks like this... well, there's no price you can put on something like that, so I won't even try. But let me give you... ... a hearty handshake.
E: with great poignancy
C: MRS. SLATE
D: Dear, don't you think a little more than that is in order?
C: SLATE
D: Honey, you're being hysterical, go lie down, okay?
C: MRS. SLATE
D: I am not being hysterical, I am being fair -- now the Flintsteins and Rabbles saved all of our lives, not to mention your reputation.
C: SLATE
D: Okay, okay. Boys, I'm feeling guilty about how you've been taken advantage of, so I'll tell you what... I'm going to give you back all world-wide rights to Fibrerock, free and clear. He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it.
E: sighing to Fred and Barney
C: SLATE
D: Your only obligation will be to cover oh, whatever legal expenses might surface at some later time...
C: BARNEY
D: You think there's gonna be some? Slate looks around at -- HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see. As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City collapse, crushing a police car. BACK TO SCENE
C: SLATE
D: Oh, you never know...
E: casually
C: RESCUE DINOS
D: Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of Fibrerock crumbs.
N: FRED, BARNEY, SLATE AND OTHERS All turn at the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT. Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the pile, munching like crazy. Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some pieces, he nibbles on it a little.
C: FRED
D: Barn...? What's going on?
C: BARNEY
D: Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap... all still there, but now the nutrients are all released... ... Fred, this... this is Dino kibble!
E: sniffing it realizing
C: FRED
D: Dino kibble...? Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. His eyes widen...
C: FRED
D: Dhinough khibble!! He spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract Slate wrote on.
E: mouth full
C: FRED
D: Barney, we -- we're rich! Yabba dabba do -- !
C: SLATE
D: Faints dead away! The CAMERA PULLS BACK... BACK... BACK -- EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
N: We're back where we began. As "The End" appears on the drive-in screen, cars are streaming out of the drive-in theatre. The Flintstone car is among them.
S: EXT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Fred and company roll into a '50's-style drive-in restaurant. A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS. A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over. Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods, scampers O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici- pation... and then the girl returns with a massive rack of ribs on a car tray. She hooks it on the edge of the driver's door... and the entire car tips over with a crash.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT
N: WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down beside it. He shuts the door. Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window. Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the door... it's locked!
C: MUSIC
D: We'll have a yabba dabba-do time A dabba-do time We'll have a gay old time!
E: V.O.
C: FRED
D: Wilma...? ... Wilma? CAMERA CRANES UP, WIDENS as Fred becomes a tiny sil- houette banging on the door.
E: knocking another knock
C: FRED
D: Wilma? Wil-ma --!
T: FADE OUT.
