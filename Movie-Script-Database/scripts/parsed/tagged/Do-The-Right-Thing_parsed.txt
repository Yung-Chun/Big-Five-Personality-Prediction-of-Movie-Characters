N: "The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown violent. It is a miracle that 22 million black people have not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the democratic tradition! It is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued to believe in a turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die philosophy! It is a miracle that the American Black people have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's heaven! The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro 'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black masses quiet until now." --THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X TITLES--WHITE ON BLACK

N: INT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY CAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa bed. CLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS WE SEE him counting his money. This isn't any ordinary counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the "dead presidents"--are facing the same way. This is MOOKIE. Once he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks into his sister's bedroom. INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY CLOSE UP--JADE JADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep. Mookie's fingers ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips. Jade pushes his hands away. Mookie waits several beats and he continues. Jade wakes up--mad.

D: Do me a favor. Go to work.
C: MOOKIE
D: Later. Gotta get paid.
N: He plants a big fat juicy on his sister's forehead. EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY A 1975 El Dorado pulls up in front of the neighborhood pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria. From out of the car comes the owner, SAL, a slightly overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, PINO, 22, and VITO, 20. It's time for them to go to work at Sal's Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn. Sal's sits on the corner of The Block.

N: EXT: MOOKIE'S BROWNSTONE--DAY Mookie comes down his stoop and walks to work. EXT: STREET--DAY The Block is beginning to come to life. Those unlucky souls who have to work this Saturday drag themselves to it, and the kids are out on the street to play in the hot sun all day long. EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY Mookie stops to say hello to MOTHER SISTER. She leans out her window on the parlor floor. In the summertime, the only time when she's not perched in her window is when she's asleep.
C: MOTHER SISTER
D: Good morning, Mookie.
C: MOOKIE
D: Good morning to you.
C: MOTHER SISTER

C: MOOKIE
D: What we say. I didn't hear Sal say nuthin'.
N: Pino looks at his father. He wants to be backed up on this; all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito.
C: PINO
D: Who's working for who?
N: There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.
C: SAL
D: Come on in, Mayor.
C: DA MAYOR
D: Good morning, gentlemens. It's gonna be a scorcher today, that's for sure. Need any work done around here?
N: Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.
C: DA MAYOR
D: It will be the cleanest sidewalk in Brooklyn. Clean as the Board of Health.
N: Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.
C: PINO
D: Pop, I don't believe this shit. We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--

N: EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY Da Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be. As soon as he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle. EXT: STOOP--DAY A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone. They are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA.

D: Punchy told me to.
C: AHMAD
D: Don't listen to him, it will get ya in trouble.
C: ELLA
D: Heard that, Punchy.
N: Ahmad sits down with them.
C: AHMAD
D: Ella, you have a brain, use it.
N: In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box. The sound gets louder as the box gets closer. The youths look down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them. He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop. This is RADIO RAHEEM. The size of his box is tremendous and one has to think, how does he carry something that big around with him? It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk shakes as the rap music blares out. The song we hear is the only one Radio Raheem plays. MEDIUM SHOT--RADIO RAHEEM Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and turns down the volume. It's quiet again.
C: RADIO RAHEEM
D: Peace, y'all.
C: ELLA
D: Peace, Radio Raheem.

C: KOREAN CLERK
D: No mo' Bud. You look what we have and buy.

D: Alright. Alright. Y'know you're asking a lot to make a man change his beer, that's asking a lot, Doctor.
N: EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom. He stops and takes a long swig.
C: MOTHER SISTER
D: You ole drunk. What did I tell ya about drinking in front of my stoop? Move on, you're blocking my view.
N: Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his heckler. It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard this before. Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.
C: MOTHER SISTER
D: You ugly enough. Don't stare at me.
N: Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.
C: MOTHER SISTER
D: The evil eye doesn't work on me.
C: DA MAYOR
D: Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
C: MOTHER SISTER

D: Besides that. Da Mayor don't bother nobody. Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you. Da Mayor just mind his business. I love everybody. I even love you.
C: MOTHER SISTER
D: Hold your tongue. You don't have that much love.
C: DA MAYOR
D: One day you'll be nice to me. We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice. At least civil.
N: Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a final swig of beer just for her. INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY An elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her daughter TINA in Spanish. Tina, having heard enough, closes the door on her mother's ranting and raving. ANGLE--TINA Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts. She talks to her son while walking around the room.
C: TINA
D: Hector, I shouldn't be telling you this but you would find out sooner or later. Ya father ain't no real father. He's a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world. Your father is to the curb. You're smart. I see that look on ya face. You're saying if he's such a bum why am I with him? Good question. Like I said before, you're no dummy. He talked his way into my panties, I thought being a mother would make me happy, make me whole. He's a mistake, but you are not.
N: Tina kisses her son. Tina is seventeen years old, another teenage parent. EXT: STREET CORNER--DAY Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall, a small group of men meet. They have no steady employment, nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift of gab. These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get philosophical. These men become the great thinkers of the world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the homeless, and AIDS. They're called the Corner Men: SWEET DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML. All three are sitting in folding chairs up against a wall in the shade.
C: ML
D: The way I see it, if this hot weather continues, it will surely melt the polar caps and the whole wide world--the parts that ain't water already--will be flooded.

C: VITO
D: Take it easy, Pop.
C: SAL
D: Don't start on me today.
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
C: SAL
D: You a troublemaker?
N: Pino walks over to Buggin' Out.
C: PINO
D: You making trouble.
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: Put some brothers up on this Wall of Fame. We want Malcolm X, Angela Davis, Michael Jordan tomorrow.

N: Nilda hands him a handful of singles. Mookie looks at the crumpled mess. Nilda attempts to close the door, but Mookie's foot says, "Hell no."
C: MOOKIE
D: Hold it. Let me count this first.
N: First he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills.
C: MOOKIE
D: You're short.

C: MOOKIE
D: Twelve is right, but no tip.
C: NILDA
D: No tip.
C: MOOKIE
D: Look, lady. I carried your pizza up five flights of stairs and shit. The cheese didn't slide over to one side like it sometimes does with delivery people who don't care. I do care. May I get paid?
N: Nilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going anywhere.
C: NILDA
D: Wait here.
C: MOOKIE
D: I'll wait.
N: Nilda goes into the apartment and we hear her talking in Spanish to a male. ANGLE--MOOKIE Mookie bends down to tie his sneakers. ANGLE--DOOR Nilda reappears and holds out a lonely lone dollar for him. Mookie has her hold it out for awhile, then he takes it.

X CLOSE UP--THE WHITE-HOT SUN HOT, HOTTER AND HOTTEST MONTAGE Right now, folks, we're gonna suspend the narrative and show how people are coping with the oppressive heat. People are taking cold showers. Sticking faces in ice-cold, water-filled sinks. Heads stuck in refrigerators. A wife tells her husband, "Hell no, I'm not cooking. It's too hot. The kitchen is closed." Men downing six-packs of ice-cold brew. Faces stuck directly in front of fans. A young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac. The moment the egg hits the car hood it starts to cook. The kid looks directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him. And how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines. New York Post: "A SCORCHER" New York Daily News: "2 HOT 4 U?" New York Newsday: "OH BOY! BAKED APPLE" New York Times: "RECORD HEATWAVE HITS CITY" EXT: STREET--DAY CLOSE UP--JOHNNY PUMP POW! A powerful gush of water flies out RIGHT AT THE CAMERA. Ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white stream of water flies across the street. This attracts all the people of the block. It's a chance to cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat. ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY They both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk. ANGLE--ELLA She stands with caution away from the fire hydrant. Ella does not want to get wet. ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY They're still scraping away. ANGLE--STREET Folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play. ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY Both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the johnny pump. Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and places the can over the water. The can now directs the water into giant streams. ANGLE--ELLA Ahmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up. She's kicking and screaming furiously.
C: ELLA
D: Ahmad! Put me down! Put me down! I can't get wet! I'm not playing!
N: Ahmad is not having it. He carries a kicking Ella into the middle of the street in direct line of fire.
C: AHMAD
D: Yo!
C: ELLA
D: No!
N: They both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to the bone. Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him. ANGLE--STREET We hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box. CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM Radio Raheem is too cool. By the way he's dressed, it could be fall, not the hottest day of the year. But you could never tell it from him. He's too cool. CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM Raheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want to get wet either. And if his box gets wet, somebody is gonna die. Cee knows this too. ANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP Cee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so Radio Raheem can pass. ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM He slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch. When he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as folks play. ANGLE--STREET We hear a car horn blowing. People move out of the way as the vehicle speeds through the spray.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but underneath the salsa music. Radio Raheem does not like to be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him competition, this is no good. Radio Raheem stands in front of the stoop and raises his decibel level. ANGLE--STOOP The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him in Spanish. There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing in a deafening roar. One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the stoop and goes to the car. ANGLE--CAR Stevie turns the car radio off.

D: You don't listen to me, never have. Just run your big fucking mouth always playing big brother. You don't listen, but Mookie does.
N: HOT CITY NIGHT MONTAGE THE BLOCK. WE'VE SEEN it at daytime, but now WE SEE it at night. Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless the heat is still stifling. And in a peculiar, funny sort of way, it's worse. You expect it to be hot during the light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well, not tonight, it's hot. All the residents of The Block: the Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit. Everyone is outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids are playing, running up and down the block. Now it's the hottest night of the year. EXT: STREET--NIGHT Buggin' Out sits down on a car next to Radio Raheem; as usual, his box is blasting.
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: How you be?
C: RADIO RAHEEM
D: I be. I'm living large.

D: Is that the only tape you got?

D: I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint. Ya see what I'm saying?
C: RADIO RAHEEM
D: I almost had to yoke him this afternoon. Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please. Who the fuck he think he is? Don Corleone and shit.
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers. Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
C: RADIO RAHEEM
D: Talk to me.
C: BUGGIN' OUT

N: INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT Vito, Pino and Mookie are cleaning up.
C: MOOKIE
D: Sal, it's almost quitting time so please start counting my pay. I gotta get paid.
N: Sal is looking into the cash register.
C: SAL
D: We did good business today. We got a good thing going. Nothing like a family in business working together. One day the both of you will take over...and Mookie, there will always be a place for you at Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Y'know, it should be Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria.
N: ANGLE--VITO, PINO, AND MOOKIE All three look at each other. The horror is on their faces, with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives. Is this their future? It's a frightening thought. ANGLE--DOOR Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella enter.
C: SAL
D: We're about to close.
C: AHMAD
D: Just four slices, regular slices. Please. To go!
C: SAL
D: OK, but that's it. It's been a long day.
N: Mookie goes over to the table where Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella sit.
C: MOOKIE
D: Look, I want you to get your slices, then outta here. No playing around.
C: AHMAD
D: You got it.
C: MOOKIE
D: Good. No joke. We all wanna go home.
N: OH NO! We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box. As everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem are inside already. We have never heard the rap music as loud as it is now. You have to scream to be heard and that's what they do.
C: SAL
D: What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
C: SAL
D: What da fuck! Are you deaf?
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: No, are you? We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
C: SAL
D: Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off. We ain't in Africa.
N: Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is.
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
C: SAL
D: It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
C: PINO
D: Radio Raheem.
C: RADIO RAHEEM
D: Fuck you.
C: SAL
D: What ever happened to nice music with words you can understand?
C: RADIO RAHEEM
D: This is music. My music.
C: VITO
D: We're closed.
C: BUGGIN' OUT
D: You're closed alright, till you get some Black people up on that wall.
N: Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again and again. The music stops. CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens. It's going to the junkyard quick. ANGLE--PIZZERIA There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey Mantle bat. All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is about to happen. ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.
C: RADIO RAHEEM
D: My music!
N: Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts to choke his ass. Radio Raheem's prized possession--his box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't give a fuck anymore. He's gonna make Sal pay with his life. Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his grip around Sal's neck. Buggin' Out tries to help his friend. Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella cheerlead. EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT The tangled mass of choking, biting, kicking, screaming confusion flies through the door of Sal's out onto the sidewalk. CLOSE--EDDIE The kid yells:

ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Sal, Vito, and Pino are still entangled, rolling around on the sidewalk, but now before an entertained crowd of onlookers: ANGLE--DA MAYOR
C: DA MAYOR
D: Break it up. This is crazy.
N: The fight continues. Da Mayor is smart enough not to get in the middle of this war. We hear sirens, somebody has called DA COPS. ANGLE--STREET The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running over some people. The cops get out with nightsticks and guns drawn. WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long and Ponte. Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are gonna go for. You know the deal! Buggin' Out is pulled off first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man. It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a beet from being choked. ANGLE--COPS Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him. ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM Radio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty- pound bag of Idaho potatoes. ANGLE--STREET Officers Long and Ponte kick him.
C: OFFICER LONG
D: Get up! Get up!
N: Radio Raheem just lies there like a bump on a log. ANGLE--CROWD The crowd stares at Radio Raheem's still body. He's unconscious or dead. CLOSE--OFFICER LONG
C: OFFICER LONG
D: Quit faking.
N: ANGLE--STREET The officers all look at each other. They know, they know exactly what they've done. The infamous Michael Stewart choke hold.
C: OFFICER PONTE
D: Let's get him outta here.
N: The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him into the back seat. Buggin' Out is pushed into another car. The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have left the crowd. It's at this point the crowd becomes an angry mob. ANGLE--MOB The mob looks at... ANGLE--MOB POV Sal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito and Pino, who are in bad shape themselves. ANGLE--MOB The mood/tone of the mob is getting ugly. Once again they have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the hands of the cops. We hear the murmurs of the folks go through the crowd.
C: VOICES OF MOB THEY KILLED HIM THEY KILLED RADIO RAHEEM IT'S MURDER DID IT AGAIN
D: JUST LIKE THEY DID MICHAEL STEWART
C: MURDER ELEANOR BUMPERS MURDER IT'S NOT SAFE
D: NOT EVEN IN OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD
C: IT'S NOT SAFE NEVER WAS
D: NEVER WILL BE
N: The cops, in their haste to get Radio Raheem out of there, have left an angry mob of Black folks with a defenseless Sal, Vito, and Pino. The mob looks at them.
C: VOICES OF MOB WON'T STAND FOR IT THE LAST TIME FUCKIN' COPS THE LAST TIME IT'S PLAIN AS DAY
D: DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL THE BOY
N: HIGH ANGLE Mookie looks at the crowd and notices he's on the wrong side. He leaves Sal and his two sons. ANGLE--STREET Da Mayor walks in front of the crowd.
C: DA MAYOR
D: Good people, let's all go home. Somebody's gonna get hurt.
C: CROWD
D: Yeah, you!
E: OS
C: DA MAYOR

C: CROWD
D: Get out of the way, old man. You a Tom anyway.
E: OS
C: DA MAYOR
D: Let 'em be.
N: ANGLE--STREET Mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the street. He walks through the crowd, up to Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino. CLOSE--MOOKIE He screams.
C: MOOKIE
D: HATE!!!!
N: SLOW MOTION Mookie hurls the garbage can through the plate glass window of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. That's it. All hell breaks loose. The dam has been unplugged, broke. The rage of a people has been unleashed, a fury. A lone garbage can thrown through the air has released a tidal wave of frustration. ANGLE--STREET Da Mayor pushes Sal, Vito, and Pino out of the way as the mob storms into Sal's Famous Pizzeria. INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT The people rush into Sal's Famous Pizzeria, tearing it up. CLOSE--CASH REGISTER The cash register is opened. WE SEE only coins, Sal has the paper. EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT Da Mayor leads Sal, Vito, and Pino back to his stoop where they watch in horror.

C: MOTHER SISTER
D: Burn it down. Burn it down.
N: One might have thought that the elders--who through the years have been broken down, whipped, their spirits crushed, beaten into submission--would be docile, strictly onlookers. That's not true except for Da Mayor. The rest of the elders are right up in it with the young people. INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT CLOSE--PHOTOS ON WALL OF FAME The photos of famous Italian-Americans are burning. EXT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--NIGHT The mob now moves across the street in front of the Korean fruit and vegetable stand. Sweet Dick Willie, Coconut Sid, and ML stand at the head of the mob.
C: ML
D: It's your turn.

E: VO
N: POW! The hoses are turned on the mob. WE SEE Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, ML, Coconut Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc., go down before the powerful blast of the firehouse. Now we've come full circle. We're back to Montgomery or Birmingham, Alabama. The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull Connor and the German shepherds. It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the mob got. People are trying to hold on to each other, cars, railings, anything to keep from being swept away. EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino watch in disbelief. It's unbelievable what is happening before their eyes.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX Radio Raheem's box has melted into a black mass of goo. CLOSER--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX As WE MOVE IN TIGHTER ON the melted box, we begin to hear the rap song that we've hear throughout. All other sound drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until it's deafening. ANGLE--SMILEY Smiley sits up from where he hid during the burning and looting of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Smiley looks around and goes directly to the smoldering Wall of Fame. He stands there. Smiley pins one of his Malcolm X/Martin Luther King, Jr., cards to the Wall of Fame. CLOSE--PHOTO CLOSE--SMILEY We're on Smiley's face and a smile slowly travels across. It's the first time Smiley has smiled in years and nobody is there to see this event.
