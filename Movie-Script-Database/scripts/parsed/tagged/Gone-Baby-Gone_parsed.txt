M: Morning.
M: Clouds moving through the sky.
N: We see various shots of the city, exterior storefronts, people going about their lives and some wider shots of the city. As they continue, the hour gets progressively later in the day until the final sequence which takes place at night. Over this we hear our guy, PATRICK (30). PATRICK (V. 0 . ) To people who grow up here, this city is like family. The thing about family, about the city, about the church, about the people you grow up with-- is that no matter how much they hurt you, no matter what the cost is, you still love them. And despite all our flaws-- what we do to each other-- what is done to us-- I've always felt proprietary about it all. Like the old commercial for dog food: 'doesn't your dog deserve to be treated like a member of the family?' I've always believed it depended on the dog. Beyond that, the most I thought about anything was what I wanted to do. Who I wanted to be. To rise where my father said I couldn't go, to succeed. To be a man.
S: EXT. MCCREADY THREE DECKER NIGHT
N: A playground at night, completely empty. One of the swings drifts back and forth . . . The back door to a home is open. A piece of light cuts across the porch from inside . . . Up the back stairwell another door is open, leading into an apartment . . . Down the hall, a third door opens to reveal a small, sparse bedroom. A small mattress on the floor holds a dirty-faced little girl asleep under her blanket . . . Footsteps heard, quietly moving through the house . . . A three foot gate hangs open. A car starts and pulls away. We begin to hear the voice of Jack Doyle.
C: DOYLE
D: Amanda McCready was taken from her home sometime between eight and eight thirty.
T: CUT TO:

D: She is four years old, has blond hair and green eyes, 35 pounds and about 3 and a half feet tall. Amanda's mother says she put her to bed in her B e a u t y and t h e B e a s t nightgown . . .
N: Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro sit in the car watching idly. TV: A clip from an interview with Amanda's mother, HELENE MCCREADY (29-39). She looks haggard and in desperate need of sleep, if not a stint in detox. Standing beside her is her brother LIONEL and sister-in-law BEATRICE, both of whom we will come to know later.
C: HELENE
D: The thing is she just always had a smile on her face, you know? That was her. She was always smilin'.

C: BOBBY
D: Hey. How are you?
E: winks, being funny 
C: PATRICK
D: Good, Bobby. Nice to see you.
N: Bobby moves on down the street. She looks at Patrick.
C: ANGIE
D: This is why it's embarrassing to do surveillance three blocks from where we live.
N: Over Patrick and through the windshield we see A MAN AND A WOMAN emerge from a MINT GREEN 3-DECKER.
C: PATRICK
D: There they go.
N: They kiss before parting ways. The MAN hops into a GREEN LINCOLN while the WOMAN heads down the block, on foot.
C: PATRICK
D: They' re splitting up.
E: CONT' D
C: ANGIE
D: Go with him. I'll follow the mother.
N: Angie jumps out and starts following the woman. Patrick pulls slowly from the curb and trails the Lincoln. ANGIE'S CAR, DRIVING - DAY (MOVING)

A woman MAUREEN, Irish (34) is making breakfast. She calls out to the next room. MAUREEN (CALLING OUT) You want them eggs runnin' ? TOMMY MEADE rolls into frame, bitching about his condition.

C: ANGIE
D: It's better than the old one.
C: PATRICK
D: You're just saying that cause the new one has your name on it. Patrick takes his gun out, wallet, puts them on the table.
C: ANGIE
D: At a certain point the person who books half the business is entitled to her name on the door.
N: (BEAT) Speaking of which, how'd you get Tommy?
C: PATRICK
D: These people need to learn how to hide better. Staying at your girlfriend's in OC projects ain't slick.
N: (BEAT) ( MORE )

N: BEA MCCREADY' S FACE ANGIE'S APT - MORNING
S: INT. PATRICK &
N: Patrick is standing in the doorway, looking at Beatrice and Lionel McCready, not entirely sure what to say.
C: BEATRICE
D: My niece is missing.
S: INT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S OFFICE DAY
N: Close on a hand picking clothes up off the couch in their 'officer-- which is basically their living room. Now we get a good look at their guests, who are standing politely. BEA MCCREADY (mid 50s, matronly) we recognize from the TV clip. She has a kind patience that has been tried by her ordeal. Her husband, LIONEL (mid 40s)' we remember as well. Lionel is the kind of man who was once a hard drinker, a fighter and a troublemaker. Now 'recovered,' he has been a husband, provider and peacemaker for almost twenty years. Angie is also trying to tidy the detritus of their morning which lie strewn around their office, including a bra which is behind the couch.
C: PATRICK
D: I heard about that on the news . . .Excuse the mess. We just finished another case. . .
C: ANGIE
D: I am so sorry, Mrs. McCready. I can't imagine what this time must be like for your family.
C: PATRICK
D: This is my associate, Angela Gennaro.
N: They all four stand there, not sure what comes next.
C: BEATRICE
D: We want to hire you to augment the police with the investigation.
N: No one says anything.
C: LIONEL
D: Like Jean Benet Ramsey. The family hired investigators.
C: PATRICK
D: Right. I remember that.
C: BEATRICE
D: The Police are nowhere, they're slow, they keep us in the dark. We want our own investigators.
C: ANGIE
D: I'm not sure we're who you're looking for.
C: BEATRICE
D: Isn't that what you do? The ad in the paper said 'missing persons.' Tiniest of looks from Patrick to Angie.
C: PATRICK
D: What Angie is trying to say is: we usually get hired to find people who like, take off to New Hampshire without payin' for their jet ski-- Bea looks up at Patrick, confused.
C: ANGIE
D: Every Police officer in Boston is looking for your niece. This is something they're qualified for.
C: BEA
D: What are you saying?
C: ANGIE
D: I'm not sure how much help we can be.
C: PATRICK
D: Hear her out, Ange.
C: BEA
D: You're not gonna do any harm, are you? Why is this so hard? The cops sent one man until I called the Herald and raised Cain. The cops don't want me hirin' you. Now you don't want the job?
E:  shaking her head
C: PATRICK
D: It's not that we don't want the job.
C: BEA
D: Don't you know people in the neighborhood? People who don't want to talk to Police?
C: PATRICK
D: Yes. We do. Have the Police told you anything so far?
C: BEA
D: If I hear they have "no leads" one more time I'm gonna lose my marbles. I mean, Helene was watching TV next door and wasn't gone for more than a half hour.
C: LIONEL
D: She was watching "Wife Swap" downstairs.
N: (BEAT) It's her favorite show.
C: PATRICK
D: Where's the father? Beatrice snorts. Lionel shoots her a look.
C: LIONEL
D: Germany. Army base. He doesn't want nothin' to do with Helene.
C: BEA
D: Or Amanda. He doesn't think she's his.
C: PATRICK
D: Is there anyone you know? An acquaintance who could have taken her . . . a neighbor?
C: LIONEL
D: I don't know. You think she was definitely taken though?
C: PATRICK
D: If she were lost I think they . . .
N: Bea may be coming unglued.
C: BEA
D: Couldn't she have fallen down a well or something? Like in Texas?
C: PATRICK
D: That's not what we hope for.. .
N: Awkward moment.
C: ANGIE
D: How is Helene holding up?
C: LIONEL
D: She's trying.
C: BEA
D: Please, Lionel.
C: LIONEL
D: Look, it. I had my problems, hard bust at 22. Bea straightened me out. Helene hasn't had that.
C: BEA
D: No, she has you. You find her work-- she was our housekeeper for a year and a half-
N: (BEAT) Look, come talk to Helene yourself. I don't care if you think you can help. Try. There must be something you can do. She looks at them expectantly.
C: PATRICK
D: We'll meet you over there. He throws Angie another small look.
C: BEA
D: We don't have a lot of money, but I saved over the years. Don't think we can't afford it. Angie gives her a smile.
N: ANGIE'S CAR - LATER
S: INT. PATRICK &
N: Patrick and Angie are in their car. They pull to a stop, looking at something off-camera right.
C: ANGIE
D: If a missing child isn't found in seventy two hours they are almost never recovered.
C: PATRICK
D: Pretty quick with the facts for someone who's so unqualified.
C: ANGIE
D: I read that on the computer in two minutes while you were getting dressed.
C: PATRICK
D: See that, you're already on the case.
C: ANGIE
D: We aren't needed, we canrt make a difference and we can't take their money.
C: PATRICK
D: I don't want to take their money.
C: ANGIE
D: I don't want to find a child in a dumpster.
C: PATRICK
D: Neither do I. I want to find one alive who we can bring home.
C: ANGIE
D: We have a good life, Patrick.
C: PATRICK
D: This won't change that.
C: ANGIE
D: You go out in the rain, you get wet.
C: PATRICK
D: If it's a four year-old girl out there, you go out and bring her back. We'll be okay.
N: (SMILES) It's just rain. DAY
S: EXT HELENE'S APT. -
N: We might recognize it from the nighttime abduction sequence except that now it's swarming with: CAMERA TRUCKS, MEDIA TYPES and LOOKEY-LOOS. This is a big shot full of REPORTERS, LOCALS, KIDS, A GUY WITH A GRILL, AN ICE-CREAM TRUCK. People mill around and converse. KIDS wave behind REPORTERS heads, trying to get on camera. We carry Patrick and Angie through with a Steadi-Cam as they react to the circus. A FIELD REPORTER does a stand-up, dressed formally to the waist in a sports coat and tie but wears shorts below. He has heavy pancake make-up on.
C: PATRICK
D: Block party.
S: EXT. HELENE'S APT - DAY
N: They reach the front porch. One, OFFICER REILLY (from TV) stops Patrick as he comes in.
C: OFFICER REILLY
D: Friends of the family?
N: Patrick rolls his eyes.
C: PATRICK
D: Timrny. It's me.
N: Lionel is out on the porch.
C: LIONEL
D: It's okay. Come on in. Patrick heads down the hall toward the kitchen but turns back when he sees Angie going into the living room.
S: INT. HELENE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM CONTINUOUS
N: Patrick and Angie enter the small two bedroom apartment. It is crowded and crawling with police. HELENE MCCREADY (in rough shape) sits wearing a "born to shop" T-shirt. Her best friend DOTTIE sits next to her. They are engrossed in a DAY-TIME TALK SHOW. Dottie wears a "Dot Rat" T-shirt.
C: LIONEL
D: Helene, this is Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. The two women on the couch look over.
C: DOTTIE
D: I remember you.
N: Angie looks blank.
C: DOTTIE
D: MRM high.
E: CONT' D
N: Angie offers a fake smile, half-recognition, polite.
C: DOTTIE
D: I see you're still conceited.
E: CONT' D
C: LIONEL
D: Could you excuse us, Dottie?
C: HELENE
D: Dottie's my best friend, Lionel. She can be in my house if she wants.
C: PATRICK
D: We just want to ask a few questions.
C: HELENE
D: She can be here for that.
N: PATRICK (TO LIONEL) It's fine. DOTTIE (TO HELENE) Now everyone wants to be part of it.
C: HELENE
D: I know.
N: (TO ANGIE) I already talked to the cops forty times.
C: ANGIE
D: We're sorry to take up your time.

C: DOTTIE
D: She's in grief, prick.
C: LIONEL
D: She can grieve how she wants, Dottie. You don't live here.
C: HELENE
D: Don't yell at her. You ain't her father!
C: DOTTIE
D: Fuck you, Lionel. Lionel marches over toward Dottie. She scoots in a hurry.
C: DOTTIE
D: Get away from me! Dottie storms from the room. Patrick and Angie stand uncomfortably in the hall.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: I'm sorry.
C: ANGIE
D: Maybe we should go.
C: LIONEL
D: I'm sorry . . . I understand.
N: BEA (0.3.) Can I speak with you for a minute?
C: PATRICK
D: Can you excuse us, Helene?
N: Helene ignores her.
S: INT. HELENE'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Bea stands at the far end of the hallway, distraught. She holds a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH in her hand.
C: LIONEL
D: Helene has emotional problems.
C: BEATRICE
D: It's not that, Lionel.
C: LIONEL
D: What is it, then?
N: What Bea says belies her matronly kindness.
C: BEATRICE
D: She's a cunt.
C: LIONEL
D: Beatrice! Don't say that word.
C: BEATRICE
D: God help me, it's true.
C: LIONEL
D: For God's sake, the walls are thin.
C: BEATRICE
D: I don't care anymore, Lionel. Let her hear. Bea hands Patrick the photograph of Amanda.
C: BEATRICE
D: This is a child. And I don't know where she is. Angie looks to Patrick.
E: CONT' D beat, cracking
N: ANGIE (COMFORTING SMILE) Well. We can't do any harm, right? SAME LATER (KITCHEN) The sink is FULL OF SHIT. Lionel tries getting out a cup for coffee. Patrick, Lionel, and Bea sit around the kitchen. Angie makes her way around the kitchen, looking over the environment. Shots of the mess that is Helene's apartment (and a nod to our extraordinary set decorator.)
C: PATRICK
D: What about who she hangs out with? What kind of people are around?
N: Bea looks to Lionel to answer this sort of thing.
C: LIONEL
D: I don't know. She's at the Fillmore all the time.
C: PATRICK
D: The Fillmore Lounge?
E: knows its reputation
C: LIONEL
D: She drinks every day, she's got the gene. The disease. Our parents had it, too.

C: PATRICK
D: How much is a little?
C: LIONEL
D: I don't know . . . few times a week, maybe. How much is a lot?
C: PATRICK
D: Few times a week is a lot.
C: LIONEL
D: Then she does a lot. I don't know anything about that.
N: (TO PATRICK) I put the plug in the jug, myself. I got twenty three years sobriety. There is a short beat before:

C: ANGIE
D: You mind if we look in her room?
S: INT AMANDA'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Patrick and Angie stand just inside the door to Amanda's drab little bedroom. The only furniture a TWIN-SIZED MATTRESS and a CHEST OF DRAWERS. It's all third hand.
C: PATRICK
D: We get a bonus for finding the furniture?
N: Patrick looks over the dirtied walls, faded glowing stars, stickers, a sad sight.
C: ANGIE
D: Maybe she ran away.
C: DOYLE
D: Solved it yet? Patrick and Angie turn to the voice. Standing in the doorway is JACK DOYLE, the police officer from the TV report.

C: DOYLE
D: Good. I don't care who finds her. I just want it done.
C: ANGIE

C: DOYLE
D: Fine. Keep us apprised.

N: DOYLE (SMILES) I'll put my two best men on it. Where can they find you?
S: EXT FILLMORE LOUNGE DAY
N: The Fillmore Lounge is a dreary looking bar up an alley off Dorchester Avenue. Degenerate drinkers are now forced to go outside and smoke under the noon day sun and the place's faux, stacked stone facade .
S: INT FILLMORE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
N: And it's no more welcoming inside. Men come here to nurse their drug habits, their alcoholism and their hate. While you wouldn't think there were many clamoring to get into their club, they don't look kindly on potential applicants. At one end of the bar, LENNY (mid 40' s) sips a whiskey and studies the Keno results. In the rear, 4 ALCOHOLICS sit around muttering to one another. And at one of the tables a CAULIFLOWER FACED MAN drinks alone. In addition there is a SMATTERING OF ROUGH LOOKING FACES. The bartender BIG DAVE (hence the name) has a newspaper spread out before him on the bar.
C: PATRICK
D: I'm not asking for the combination to the safe here . . .
C: BIG DAVE
D: I got nothin' to say. I already talked to the cops.

S: INT. FILMORE LOUNGE, BOOTH LATER
N: We come off the face of a interesting man to see: Patrick, Angie, and Steve sitting around a table sharing a pitcher of beer.
C: STEVE
D: Oh, it's a real tragedy. She used to come in here, sit up on the bar and shit . . . She was like our mascot.
C: ANGIE
D: Helene brought Amanda in here?
C: STEVE
D: No, mostly in the afternoons. It's not the place for a child at night.
C: ANGIE
D: Really?
C: STEVE
D: Hot tempers. Lotta drugs.
E: lowers his voice
C: PATRICK
D: How much does Helene come in?
C: STEVE
D: Like five nights a week. She's a fuckin' coke head guys. Don't get me wrong, you don't want that for no one. But it's not a real shocker. I seen her on the news saying how she was at her neighbor's for a half hour? Bullshit. She was in here snappin' lines for two hours.
E: off their reaction pause. His voice almost a whisper now.
C: PATRICK
D: Are you sure it was the same night?
C: STEVE
D: Yeah, cause she was bumpin' rails in the shitter with Ray. I was knockin' on the door.

C: STEVE
D: I know them.
C: PATRICK

C: PATRICK
D: We're trying to help Helene find her daughter.
C: BIG DAVE
D: Kids go missing all the time. They always show back up.
C: ANGIE
D: Why don't you mind your business?
N: Angle's comment stops Lenny.
C: LENNY
D: Oh, shit, Dave. She told you.
C: BIG DAVE
D: She wants to come in here and be a smart ass?
C: PATRICK

N: ALCOHOLIC #1 Ask her if she sucks cock.
C: LENNY
D: Ask her yourself. The door outside is ajar. LENNY'S PAL pushes it CLOSED.
C: PATRICK
D: What the fuck is wrong with you?

N: The alcoholic men are laughing, egging one another on.
C: BIG DAVE
D: Lenny, think she wants to see your prick, first. Patrick reaches into his waistband and puts his hand on a SMALL HOLSTER, revealing a 9mrn Kahr handgun.

D: Patrick, letfs go. They move to the door.
S: EXT DORCHESTER AVE.- CONTINUOUS
N: Patrick and Angie emerge. They look to one another. Sounds of laughter return inside. The guys appear to have gone right back to their day. Patrick tucks his gun away and looks to Angie.
C: PATRICK
D: You okay?
C: ANGIE
D: I'm fine. How's your hand.
C: PATRICK
D: It fuckinf stings. He indicates his hand, there is some blood. He smiles. They are a little rattled.

D: No problem.
N: OMIT
S: EXT PATRICK AND ANGIE'S 2ND STORY PORCH - SUNSET
N: Patrick and Angie look out over the neighborhood. Kids run around. Adults watch them.
C: ANGIE
D: Helene was in there getting high--while her kid was at home for two hours. What kind of mother does that?
C: PATRICK
D: One who doesn't know better. A poor one. An abused one. A damaged one.
C: ANGIE
D: A selfish one. They look out over the kids running past.
C: PATRICK
D: Listen, you don't have to do this. I'm fine. If you want to bow out-
C: ANGIE
D: Have you ever known me to bow out on anything before?
C: PATRICK
D: No. But that was a scary thing.
N: Without looking at him.
C: ANGIE
D: Why? Because of those men? You think they were gonna rape me? She smiles at him.
C: PATRICK
D: They weren't gonna do that.
N: (BEAT) They might ' got shot. But they weren't gonna do that. . . She looks up
C: ANGIE
D: They' re not what I'm afraid of, Patrick.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DUDLEY SQUARE, ROXBURY - MORNING, ESTABLISHING
N: A big bus station. The place bustles with activity. Patrick and Anqie walk through.
S: EXT. SILVER SLIPPER RESTAURANT - MORNING
N: Patrick and Angie walk by a MURAL painted on the side of the restaurant, turn the corner and head into the diner. OMIT
S: INT. SILVER SLIPPER DINER, ROXBURY - MORNING
N: Patrick and Angie enter to see TWO MEN seated in a booth. REMY BRESSANT, (55) still very tough and wound very tight. NICHOLAS POOLE (58) is chubby and affable -- the 'good cop' when they do the routine. Patrick and Angie approach them. Poole is finishing a joke.
C: BRESSANT
D: Can I help you?
C: PATRICK
D: Detective Bressant?
C: BRESSANT
D: That's right.
N: Slightly confused looks exchanged.
C: PATRICK
D: Patrick Kenzie. You just called me...
N: Bressant smiles, a little embarrassed. They get up and introduce themselves.
C: BRESSANT
D: Oh, sorry. Detective Sgt. Remy Bressant.
C: POOLE
D: Shit. Detective Nick Raftopolous. Call me Poole .
E: beat, rising to shake
C: PATRICK
D: This is Angie Gennaro.
C: ANGIE
D: Is something wrong?
C: POOLE
D: No. No. I was just--
E: waves off concern
C: BRESSANT
D: We were expecting an . . . older couple, I guess.
C: ANGIE
D: Life's full of surprises.
N: Poole stifles a small, good-natured laugh. POOLE (INDICATED BOOTH) Have a seat.
S: INT. THE SILVER SLIPPER MOMENTS LATER
N: THREE MUG SHOTS slide across the table: CORWIN EARLE: 30s; 5'10" and rail thin. His eyes bulge
C: POOLE
D: This is the lead we're working: Corwin Earle.
C: BRESSANT
D: Serial molester, recently work-released. Went AWOL around the time Amanda disappeared.
C: POOLE
D: Known associates: Leon Trett and his handsome wife Roberta. Apparently, The three of them have some kind of Addams Family thing goin' on.
N: LEON TRETT, 50s; mouse-faced and hostile. ROBERTA TRETT, 50s; a frightening woman: 6 ' 330. She has the shoulders of a bank vault and a thin goatee.
C: PATRICK
D: Jesus.
C: POOLE
D: The Trett's were released six, and eight months ago respectively. They have drug habits. We don't know where they are-but we think Corwin' s with 'em. Jailhouse snitch claims Corwin confided when he got out he was going to move in with his 'family . '
C: BRESSANT
D: He was gonna find him a kid he could keep in the house and have sex with.
C: PATRICK
D: Sounds promising.
C: BRESSANT
D: Not for Amanda it doesn't.
C: PATRICK
D: That's not what I meant
C: ANGIE
D: Is this who you think has Amanda?
N: POOLE (FROWNING) Well, they' re just suspects and there's some holes in the theory. Corwin likes boys. And he likes 'em seven to nine. A pause. PATRICK (INNOCENTLY) That's what you got? There are no other suspects? BRESSANT (OFFENDED) Yeah. That's it. A convicted finger blaster who plans to keep a pre-teen at the foot of his bed and just cut off his ANKLE BRACELET--
C: POOLE
D: Take it easy, Remy--
C: BRESSANT
D: --Who the fuck is this guy? You're here because Jack Doyle had us extend you a courtesy. You got something to contribute, be my guest. Otherwise go back to your Harry Potter book.
C: PATRICK
D: I think you misunderstood my tone, sergeant detective. They gauge one another.
C: ANGIE
D: Isn't it usually someone who knows the victim?
C: POOLE
D: I think Helene McCready has plenty of people in her life capable of this.
C: PATRICK
D: I'm sure you've interviewed Ray Likanski.
C: POOLE
D: Who?
C: PATRICK
D: Ray Likanski. Skinny Ray?
N: (BEAT) No?
C: BRESSANT
D: Never heard of him.
C: PATRICK
D: Well, with all due respect, we might be able to contribute on that point--
C: POOLE
D: How' s that?
C: PATRICK
D: The night Amanda went missing Ray was doing coke at the Fillmore Lounge for two hours between eight and ten.
C: BRESSANT
D: Fascinating.
C: PATRICK
D: With Helene McCready. Poole and Bressant are genuinely surprised by this.
C: POOLE
D: She did bullshit us...
N: BRESSANT (TO POOLE) We need to straighten her out.
C: ANGIE
D: Why would she lie about that?
C: POOLE
D: 'Cause it's fucking embarrassing. They go for their coats. Patrick takes the MUG SHOTS.
C: PATRICK
D: I'll just grab a copy.. . As they stand, getting their things, Angie turns to Remy.
C: PATRICK
D: What kind of name is Bressant?
E: CONT' D
C: BRESSANT
D: The kind they give you in Louisiana.
C: PATRICK
D: I thought you were from here.
C: BRESSANT
D: Depends on how you look at it. You might think you're more 'from heref than I am, for example-- but then again, I been living here longer than you been alive.
N: (BEAT) So who's right? Patrick shakes his head.
C: PATRICK
D: I'll have to mull that over. He takes the photos.
N: PATRICK ( CONT ' D) We'll meet you over there.

E: O.C.
S: INT. BUBBA'S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Reveal BUBBA ROGOWSKI. He is around 30 and hard. He has a calm opacity which belies his strength. His loft is spare and industrial.
C: PATRICK
D: I know you don't pay your rent doin' peoplers taxes.
C: BUBBA
D: I don't do it sellin' penny rocks to wall- eyed child molesters neither.
C: PATRICK
D: Just this one, Corwin Earle, is a molester. He might be staying with the other two baseheads. Just if you hear somethin' .
C: BUBBA
D: What are you two? Crime dogs now?
C: PATRICK
D: We got hired to help find that little girl.
C: BUBBA
D: Oh yeah? Good for you. What happened?
C: ANGIE
D: Turns out the mother was down the Fillmore all night when her kid was taken.
C: PATRICK
D: With Skinny Ray.
C: BUBBA
D: Fuck him.
C: PATRICK
D: I thought you were down with them.
C: BUBBA
D: With Ray? He works for the Haitian.
C: PATRICK
D: Ray works for Cheese?
C: BUBBA
D: Ray, Chris, Cheese, the whole trash picker crew.. .
E: with a lack of regard
C: ANGIE
D: You ever sell to Helene?
C: BUBBA
D: There's reasons why there aren't three inches of plexiglass between us right now- -two of them being I don't deal with coconuts like Cheese and skeezers like Helene. Because I'm the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the fucking blind. Bubba SLAPS his hand over one eye. Angie smiles. Patrick is on his way out.
E: beat, ruefully
S: EXT. BUBBA'S LOFT - DAY
N: Patrick comes down the stairs with Angie behind. He is on the cell phone, walking past the auto body shop. PATRICK (ON PHONE) Detective, how well do you know Cheese Jean Baptiste?
S: INT. HELENE'S APARTMENT - LATER
C: HELENE
D: Who?
N: Bressant and Poole question Helene who sits at the kitchen table. Patrick, Angie, Bea and Lionel stand by.
C: POOLE
D: "Cheese" Jean Baptiste.
C: HELENE
D: It sounds familiar . . .
C: BRESSANT
D: It don't "sound familiar," Helene. He's a violent, sociopathic, Haitian criminal named "Cheese." Either you know him or you don't.
C: LIONEL
D: Who is he?
C: BEATRICE
D: He's a drug lord or something, isn't he?
C: LIONEL
D: Who is he?
C: HELENE
D: He's just a guy, Lionel.. .
C: BRESSANT
D: Ask his homey here.
C: PATRICK
D: He ain't my homey.
E: taken off guard, what?
C: BRESSANT
D: Hard to keep track with you people. Bea looks to Patrick, who shakes his head at Bressant.
C: POOLE
D: He is, among other things, a drug dealer, Mrs. McCready.
C: LIONEL
D: What other things?
C: HELENE
D: I don' t know. . .
C: BEATRICE
D: Why don't you answer your brother's questions, Helene?
C: HELENE
D: Why don't you go suck a nigger's dick, Bea? Lionel's FIST hits the table.
C: LIONEL
D: You listen to me. You don't insult my wife! And you don't make racial remarks in my kitchen. Who is this man?
C: POOLE
D: He's a drug dealer, a pimp, a
N: PORNOGRAPHER--
C: LIONEL
D: You associate with a pimp?
C: BEATRICE
D: A pornographer, Helene . . .
C: POOLE
D: And we think he rolled Pokey Jackson up in a carpet and shot him in the head on Castlegate.
N: (BEAT) So there's that, too. Bea canft fathom what shefs hearing.
C: BRESSANT
D: What do you do for him?
N: She sighs.
C: HELENE
D: I just mule. Occasionally, and not making a habit out of it.
E: impresses upon them
C: BEATRICE
D: Jesus, Mary & Joseph. What is that, Lionel?
C: LIONEL
D: It means she's a drug runner. She carries drugs. Isn't that right, Helene?
C: HELENE
D: A few times.
C: BRESSANT
D: Where?
C: HELENE
D: Providence . . . Does it matter?
C: LIONEL
D: For what?
C: HELENE
D: For fuckfs sake, Lionel. What do you think? Money. A taste . . .
C: LIONEL
D: Of what, drugs?
C: HELENE
D: Yeas, Lionel.
C: BEATRICE
D: What kind of drugs?
C: HELENE
D: Yay, ron. . .
C: BEATRICE
D: What does that mean?
C: POOLE
D: Cocaine and heroin.
C: BEATRICE
D: No, we would have seen the tract marks--
C: BRESSANT
D: Not if you snort it, right sugar?
C: HELENE
D: Less addictive that way.
N: Helene gets up and gets a beer. It's 10:15 am.
S: INT. HELENE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: The conversation has moved to the living room. The same participants, but the collection of EMPTY BEER CANS surrounding Helene suggest she's loosened up some. Patrick peers out the WINDOW to see the CIRCUS below (POV)
C: BRESSANT
D: I don't know Helene. I keep thinking about this thing I heard. You know where I'm going with this?
C: HELENE
D: No.
C: BRESSANT
D: Did you know I used to work DCU?
C: HELENE
D: I give a fuck.
C: BRESSANT
D: Right. So, I still know some of those guys real well. Anyway, I heard that someone ripped Cheese off on a New Hampshire run. You didn't hear that, did you? Angle on Patrick and Angie.
C: HELENE
D: No.
C: BRESSANT
D: Care to take a polygraph?
N: HELENE (PROUDLY) Already passed.
C: BRESSANT
D: Different questions this time.
C: POOLE
D: How much you take, Helene? Nothing. Angle on Patrick.
C: POOLE
D: It's all right. We don't care about hopheads beatin' each other. We care about your daughter.
E: CONT'D
N: (GENTLY) Come on. How much? A beat.
C: BRESSANT
D: You want Amanda back or not? Silence in the room.

C: BEATRICE
D: Nintey five thousand dollars?!
C: HELENE
D: Yeas, Bea!
C: BRESSANT
D: Howrd you do it. She exhales a long thread of smoke.
C: HELENE
D: Two weeks ago me and Ray did a run up Nashua to drop four keys on some bikers. When we was walking back through the motel with the money, all these cops swooped in and went for the bikers. Amanda was with us so we pretended to be like a family and they went right past us. So we just-- got in the car and took off.
C: BEATRICE
D: You took Amanda with you?
C: HELENE
D: What am I gonna do? Leave her in the car, Bea?
C: BEATRICE
D: You are an abomination. God as my witness.
E: shakes head, plainly
N: HELENE (GETS 'EMOTIONALR) You know what, Bea? It's hard bein' a mother. It's hard raisinf children. (beat, pointedly) And if God made you barren then you can' t judge me. 'Cause you wouldnrt fuckin' know. By Bears silence, and the narrowing of her eyes, we presume this to be a low blow and that Bea can't have children.
C: BRESSANT
D: Hey. Right here. What happened?
E: snaps fingers at Helene
N: Helene takes a pull from her beer.
C: HELENE
D: When we was driving back. Ray's like, 'everyone's gonna think the cops got the money too.'
C: BRESSANT
D: You told Cheese the cops got it?
C: PATRICK
D: But you and Ray kept the money?
C: HELENE
D: This whole fuckin' thing is Ray' s fault. Reactions to this realization.
C: POOLE
D: Where's the money now, Helene?
N: She looks at him.
C: BRESSANT
D: You want to find your daughter?
C: HELENE
D: Of course.
C: POOLE

C: HELENE
D: With Ray.

C: HELENE
D: Yeah. Did you?
C: PATRICK
D: I was freshman when you were a senior. You were with Scott Flaherty?

N: She laughs.
C: HELENE
D: You're terrible.
N: She smiles,

D: How did the money end up with Ray in Chelsea? I thought you went home after.
C: HELENE
D: We dropped off Amanda, went back to Ray's then fuckin' retarded Ray left his rock at my place-- right then I was like 'I'm dropping this motherfucker, I don't care if he does have a big dick' so we went back to the apartment, he was, hollerin' and gonna wake up Amanda, who needs her sleep, so we went back to Ray' s. Ray' s mother's, whatever. I don't know where the mother is but she left all her fuckin' cats and it smells like cock in
N: THERE--
C: PATRICK
D: Cheese never contacted you? They never left a note?
C: HELENE
D: No. We never heard nothin' from them. That' s why Ray said don' t say shit .
N: Patrick and Angie look back and forth.
C: ANGIE
D: You didn't think it was worth it, for your daughter's sake, to tell people what happened?
N: (BEAT) Cheese has your kid right now. God fuckin' knows what he's doing to her. What do you think Amanda would give to come home ?
C: HELENE
D: What am I gonna do? Call Cheese and be like-- do you have my daughter? 'Cause I ripped you off and I'm just checkin'?
N: Patrick says nothing. HELENE (CONT' D) (DEFENSIVE) Am I gonna tell the cops "I run heroin in case that' s irrelevance?"
C: PATRICK
D: The cops never asked you about Cheese before?
C: HELENE
D: No.

N: All, save Helene, stare at something just off camera. Angie's hand to her face. They register a beat of stunned silence BROKEN BY :
C: BRESSANT
D: Christ. . .
N: ANGLE ON : RAY LIKANSKI ' S DEAD BODY. He has been tied to a chair in his kitchen. Gunshots are what killed him and the condition of his corpse suggests death came as a relief. There are FIFTEEN CATS wandering around the house, meowing.
C: BRESSANT
D: They tortured him.
E: CONTFD
C: POOLE
D: Looks like he held out pretty long.
C: PATRICK
D: He didn' t have it.
C: POOLE
D: Huh?
C: PATRICK
D: He couldn't tell them where it was 'cause he didn't know. Helene hid it.
N: Bressant chuckles.
C: BRESSANT
D: Ray made poor relationship choices.
C: PATRICK
D: Guess they didn't believe him.
E: re: Ray's body
C: POOLE
D: Poor prick.
N: HELENE (0.3.) (ENTERING) I'm not waitin' in the fuckin' car-- She sees Ray and holds her hand to her mouth. It's unclear whether she is about to cry or vomit. Whichever it is, she runs out into the backyard to do it. Patrick goes after her.
S: EXT. RAY'S BACK YARD --MOMENTS LATER
N: Helene's make-up is a mess. Patrick stands next to her.
C: PATRICK
D: It's okay . . .

C: HELENE

N: He pulls a DUFFEL BAG from the ground. He opens it to reveal NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IN CASH.
C: BRESSANT
D: That wasn't a book. It was a cartoon Helene knows.
C: HELENE
D: Fuck you.
C: ANGIE
D: So, you bring in the FBI at this point?
C: BRESSANT
D: That's the worst thing we could do.
C: ANGIE
D: Why is that?
C: BRESSANT
D: 'Cause I don't want Cheese to open a bag full of newspaper and kill Amanda.
C: ANGIE
D: It ' s kidnapping.
C: BRESSANT
D: I don't see a note. You see a note?
E: turns To Poole
C: POOLE
D: Nope.
C: BRESSANT
D: We're investigating a missing children's case. Has nothing to do with kidnapping. He turns to Patrick and Angie.
C: BRESSANT
D: Fastest way Amanda gets home is we go to him, swap the money for her and walk away.
E: CONT' D
C: POOLE
D: So everyone keep their mouths shut.
N: (BEAT) Helene.
C: HELENE
D: Do you know Cheese?
E: to Patrick, looking for help
C: PATRICK
D: When we were ten. He hardly spoke English. His brother Jude was a sweet kid.
N: (BEAT) Cheese went another way.
C: HELENE
D: He wouldn't hurt her, right?
N: POOLE (INDICATES HOUSE) Ask Ray. ANGIE (TO HELENE) You know how he got his name?
C: HELENE
D: No.
C: ANGIE
D: He moved here when I did. There was a lot of tension between black American kids and Haitians-and he got it the worst.He had no running water at home. This one girl was on him real hard 'cause he smelled bad, calling him 'cheese.' All of a sudden, he breaks a bottle, holds her down, and carves the word Cheese in her face. She lost an eye. Someone found it on the sidewalk the next day.
C: PATRICK
D: And the name stuck.
C: ANGIE
D: But I'm sure Amanda will be fine.
C: BRESSANT
D: Just keep your mouth shut, okay? We can get her back. It'll be fine. I have no fear of this idiot.
N: HELENE (TO BRESSANT) You're gonna talk to him?
C: BRESSANT
D: That's the next step, yeah.
C: HELENE
D: Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him I apologize.
C: POOLE
D: Sorry goes a long way.
C: HELENE
D: She's a handful, that one. At least I know she's giving them hell. They react to this woman's feeble grip on reality.
E: sniffles, remembering fondly
C: PATRICK
D: What about Ray?
C: BRESSANT
D: You know what percentage of murders were solved last year in Boston? Twenty nine. Less in Chelsea.
C: POOLE
D: Take her home. We'll handle Chelsea. They move to go.
C: HELENE
D: I'm hungry.
C: PATRICK
D: We' 11 get you some food.
C: HELENE
D: No, her. That's the last thing she said to me before I put her to bed. She said, 'Ifm hungry." I mean, they fed her, right? She's not still hungry?
C: PATRICK
D: I donft know.

S: EXT . CHEESE' S APARTMENT, SHAWMUT AVE . ROXBURY - NIGHT
N: Patrick and Angie emerge from their car as Poole and Bressant do the same. Poole lights a cigarette.
C: BRESSANT
D: Where do you think you're going?
C: PATRICK
D: To talk to Cheese.
C: POOLE
D: No you're not.
C: BRESSANT
D: Get back in your car.
C: PATRICK
D: That's a mistake. He'll never talk to a badge. I know him. If there's a deal to be brokered we're the ones who can do it.
C: BRESSANT
D: No. Me and Nick are handling this. This is too important.
C: PATRICK
D: If you two go in, negotiate a ransom for a girl, then it is kidnapping and that's the FBI.
C: ANGIE
D: All you're gonna do is scare him and the more scared he is the worse it is for her.
N: The look at each other.
C: PATRICK
D: Do you want to get the kid back or not?

N: A PIPE BEING SMOKED. MARIJUANA BURNS
S: INT. CHEESE'S HOUSE, BACK ROOM - MINUTES LATER
C: CHEESE
D: Been a long time.
N: CHEESE JEAN BAPTISTE sits in frame. He is a wiry, intense man who looks over Patrick and Angie suspiciously. Along with Cheese, there are a MAN (CHRIS MULLEN, 30) and a WOMAN (Cheese's Girlfriend, 22, from Laos) . There are flat screen plasma TVs, piles of clothes and nearly sixty boxes of sneakers against one wall. Patrick and Angie sit opposite Cheese. Cheese exhales. He gestures to his girlfriend.
C: CHEESE
D: I'm a talk some private shit.
E: CONT' D
N: She starts to go. Chris remains.
C: CHEESE
D: But don't get too far.
E: CONT' D
C: GIRL
D: You know I' 11 be right here.
N: He looks them over. He is languid but extremely intimidating.
C: CHEESE
D: Bitches love the cheddar.
N: Small laugh.
C: PATRICK
D: How you been, Chris?
C: CHRIS MULLEN
D: Better than you.
C: PATRICK
D: Good to hear it.
N: CHEESE (TO CHRIS) Be cool. (BEAT) Been too long not to see a fool. I give you an audience. (BEAT) Go. Patrick and Anqie exchange looks. He goes.
C: PATRICK
D: We found what you were lookin' for in Chelsea.
C: CHEESE
D: What makes you think I am concerned with the doings in Chelsea?
C: PATRICK
D: Cause I know one of the idiots who robbed you lives there.
C: CHEESE
D: What idiot?
C: PATRICK
D: The one you just killed.
C: CHEESE
D: I don't know about nobody gettin' killed. If someone robbed me and end up dead, you know, life a ma' fucker.
N: He looks at Chris, they smile. Angie leans forward.
C: ANGIE
D: Cheese, I appreciate you're seeing us. I know you're busy so we' 11 be quick.
N: (BEAT) We have your money. It was buried in Ray' s backyard. (BEAT) We want to give it back to you in exchange for Amanda. The two police outside are the only other people who know. They're willing to risk their careers to do this quietly and they've sent us in here to demonstrate that. They don't want to investigate you or prosecute you for anything -- they just want the girl back.
C: CHEESE
D: What you talkin' about? What girl?
N: ANGIE (PATIENCE TRIED) You know what girl. Cheese. Amanda McCready. Who has nothing to do with Helene stealing from you. (BEAT) Don't punish her for who her mother is. (BEAT) Tell us where to meet you, tell us what your terms are and we'll do whatever makes you comfortable. You'll get your money and you made your point. Just give us Amanda. Please. Cheese seems confused.
C: PATRICK
D: Cheese, look at me. No one gives a fuck what you did. I never even liked Ray. You get the money. The girl goes home to her mother we'll say we found her in the bushes or whatever.
C: CHEESE
D: I donft know.
C: PATRICK
D: No. Don' t do this, bro. This isn' t the time for that. This is where you take the offer. It's either this real quiet or it's ten thousand fuckin' cops kickin' the door down and arresting everybody.
N: Cheese, very casually, takes a HANDGUN from out of his waistband. He examines it.
C: PATRICK
D: Yo, yo, what is this?
E: CONT'D
C: CHEESE
D: First of all, don't never come up in my spot like that. You got my money? You can leave that shit in the mailbox on you ass way out. Feel me? Some other motherfuckers let fools rob on 'em. I don't play scrimmage-- but I don't fuck with no kids-- Something occurs to Cheese.
C: CHEESE
D: Hold up. Cheese indicates Patrick's shirt with his pistol.
E: CONT' D
C: CHEESE
D: Lift up yo shirt.
E: CONT' D
N: (BEAT) What? You thought we was cool? I ain't down with you. Don't l e t me see a wire . . . A little taken aback, Patrick lifts his shirt up. CHEESE (CONT'D) (TO ANGIE) You, too, baby. Show me them tetons. From behind, we see her lift her shirt, exposing her bra. Cheese seems satisfied. He takes another whack at the pipe.
C: CHEESE
D: I know one "McCready." Kept a bitch in my stable by that name. No titties, fucked up shit goin' on with the face-- But you give her the right shit she get freaky. Bounce up and down on yo shit. Pop! Pop! Go t h e w e a s e l .
E: CONT' D
N: He goes back for the pipe, seems to lose his concentration. Patrick unsnaps his holster, subtly.
C: PATRICK
D: If you point a gun at her again I'm gonna pull your fuckin' card, okay?
N: (BEAT) You' re saying you didn't do it? Okay. What other choice do I have? We'll take your money and go along our way. (BEAT) But If I find out you' re lying, I'll spend every nickel of your money dedicated to fuckin' you up. I'll bribe cops to go after you, I'll pays guys to go after your crew, I'll tell everyone I know that you're a C.I. and a rat -- and I know a lot of people. Cheese. After that, you're gonna wished you had listened to me. (MORE)
C: PATRICK
D: 'Cause your shitty pool-hall crime syndicate headquarters will be raided, your doped up bitches will get sent back to Laos and this dumb mutherfucker
E: CONT'D
N: (RE: CHRIS) will be testifying against you for a reduced sentence while you end up in a cell with a big motherfucker, his dick and your Zippo 'cause from what I heard, guys who kill kids aren't treated too good in Concord. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe things are different these days.
C: CHEESE
D: Don't never speak to me that way.
N: (HE SMILES) You ain't shit. Yo bitch ain't shit. Neither one of y'all motherfuckers is shit. Fuck both ya' 11. If you didn't have two pig out in my meadow--! put a round in both your heads right now. Cheese's eyes narrow, his pupils like black pinpricks in his irises.
C: CHEESE
D: And if that girl only hope is you. I pray for her. She is gone, baby. Gone.
E: CONT' D
N: He laughs.
C: CHEESE
D: Out. And if I see you on the street, I'm a get discourteous on you.
E: CONT' D
N: They get up.
C: CHEESE
D: And get this sausage off my lawn.
E: CONT'D
N: He indicates Poole and Bressant who can be see through the window, smoking on a small patch of dirt outside the apartment.
S: EXT. CHEESE'S APARTMENT, SHAWMUT AVE. ROXBURY - MOMENTS LATER52
N: Patrick and Anqie approach Poole and Bressant. Patrick shakes his head.
C: POOLE
D: What happened?
C: ANGIE
D: He said he didn't know anything but if we had his money we could leave it in the mailbox.
C: BRESSANT
D: Is that what he told you?
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah, that's it.
C: POOLE
D: He said nothing else?
C: PATRICK
D: He wants you off his fuckin' lawn.
C: POOLE
D: I thought you knew the guy.
C: BRESSANT
D: Half the guys he grew up with are degenerates.
C: PATRICK
D: You know what the other half are?
C: BRESSANT
D: What?
C: PATRICK
D: Cops. But don't hold it against me.
C: BRESSANT
D: Nah. You know what I hold against you? We had one chance to make this deal. You said you knew him, you said you could do it and you fucked it up. Now we have to get a warrant for a tap, start surveillance and hope to Christ we get lucky. If that costs Amanda her life, I won't have to hold it against you. You'll hold it against yourself for a good, long time.
N: ANGIE'S APT - NIGHT
S: INT PATRICK &
N: Patrick and Angie in their bedroom. It's late and they can't sleep. A LOCAL NEWS REPEAT runs on the television woven into their dialogue. In effect, it will play like background.
C: ANGIE
D: Look, the Police taking over isn't necessarily a bad thing.
C: PATRICK
D: No?
C: ANGIE
D: They see more child exploitation in a week than we could in a career...
C: PATRICK
D: Makes you want to have kids.
N: This gets Angle's attention. She looks at him.
C: ANGIE
D: Does it make you not want to?
N: Patrick drinks his beer.
C: PATRICK
D: There's a political party in Holland that openly advocates pedophelia and won seats in parliament. In America four hundred thousand kids get abused every year. There are half a million convicted, registered sex offenders, two-thirds of them for molesting children under fourteen, there are a hundred thousand child porn web sites. They busted one in texas had seventy thousand members-- people who gave their credit cards . . . There's a group, the 'Rene Guyon' society, whose motto is 'sex before eight or it's too late.' There's a rise in the victimization of 'pre-verbal' children, for the obvious reason that they can't report their accusers. One in five American girls is sexually abused or victimized before they turn eighteen. But only one third of those every tells anyone in their lifetime that they were abused. She gives him a look: 'oh, really?'
N: PATRICK ( CONT ' D) I read that in two minutes on the computer while you were taking a shower.
C: ANGIE
D: And that tells you you don't want children.
C: PATRICK
D: It tells me there aren't enough gas chambers.
N: A beat.
C: PATRICK
D: I' d love to have a kid.
E: CONT' D
C: ANGIE
D: Yeah?
C: PATRICK
D: I'm just not sure a kid would love to be here.
N: She looks sympathetic.
C: PATRICK
D: I don't want to be the guy who fucked this up.
E: CONT' D
S: INT. PATRICK ANGIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -MORNING
N: Patrick is asleep. Angle is on the far side of the bed. The phone rings.
C: ANGIE
D: Yeah?
C: BRESSANT
D: Guess you did something right.
C: ANGIE
D: What ?
C: BRESSANT
D: Cheese came around. Called in and said he wants to make a drop. Said he left something in your mailbox.
C: ANGIE
D: Really?
C: BRESSANT
D: Well, you're gonna have to check the mailbox yourself, but yeah.
C: ANGIE
D: Great.
C: BRESSANT
D: It is and it isn't. They tape calls coming into the station now.
C: ANGIE
D: What does that mean?
C: BRESSANT
D: It means Jack heard about it, he wants you down here and he's fuckin' pissed.
N: ANGIE'S APT - MORNING
S: EXT. PATRICK &
N: They walk out the front door and, sure enough, there is an ENVELOPE in the mailbox. But what gets their attention is that jammed into the box, along with the letter is AMANDA'S
C: BLANKET.
D: Patrick takes it out, hands it to Angie. They react.
S: INT. BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING DAY
N: Patrick and Angie follow Devin down the hall.
C: PATRICK
D: What are you doing here?
C: DEVIN
D: When the boss wants you met, he only sends the best.
C: ANGIE
D: Or when he wants you brought up the back way.
N: Devin smiles.
C: DEVIN
D: That, too.
N: They walk through an area with cells in it that looks medieval. They move through another door into a small control room. Then they walk into a lobby. He comes to a stop at Doyle's SECRETARY'S DESK. His SECRETARY, RENE ( 3 0 , attractive) seems to know Devin.
C: DEVIN
D: He in there?
E: CONT'D re: Doyle's ofice
N: She nods.
C: RENE
D: Yeah he said just let 'em in.
C: DEVIN
D: That's what he said?
N: She doesn't answer. Devin turns to Patrick and Angie.
C: DEVIN
D: Good luck.
E: CONT'D
N: He starts back. They turn to the door and ENTER.
S: INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Patrick and Angie fail at entering unobtrusively. Poole and Bressant are being lectured by Captain Jack Doyle. Doyle turns his attention (for the first time) to Patrick and Angie.
C: DOYLE
D: You're late.
E: to Patrick and Angie
N: Doyle picks up a paper TRANSCRIPT and hands it to Patrick.
C: DOYLE
D: This is the transcript of a call that was recorded coming into the station this morning. Care to read the highlighted portion?
E: CONT'D
N: Patrick reads.
C: PATRICK
D: Caller: Bitch you better have my money.
N: Patrick looks up. The room is quite. He continues:
C: PATRICK
D: Detective Bressant: Who is this? Caller: You know who the fuck this is, fool - If you want that girl back you need to meet me up Quincy tonight. Fuck around for a minute and I throw that girl in the lake.
E: CONT' D Creole curse words
C: DOYLE
D: The "lake" he refers to is the water in the abandoned quarry. He refers to the transcript.
C: DOYLE
D: Detective Bressant goes on to make an unauthorized ransom arrangement to exchange Amanda McCready for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars, tonight in just that location. A moment of quiet. Doyle gestures toward Bressant.
E: CONT' D
N: DOYLE ( CONT ' D ) After some discussion, Detective Bressant was kind enough to produce this: He indicates the bag of money on his desk.
C: DOYLE
D: Look familiar?
E: CONT' D
N: Patrick and Angle offer a guilty plea by their silence.
C: DOYLE
D: Seeing as you two made the initial
E: CONT'D
N: CONTACT--
C: ANGIE
D: Captain, we were concerned for the safety
N: OF--
C: DOYLE
D: I understand what your concern was. My concern, interestingly, is also for the well being of that child. And now that concern has been elevated because of the risky and ill-advised course of action you people have taken.
N: (BEAT) (MORE)
C: DOYLE
D: The four of you have made me party to an illegal activity without my knowledge or consent and I don't fucking appreciate it.
E: CONT' D
C: BRESSANT
D: You don't have to be party to it, sir . . .
C: DOYLE
D: The hell I don't. If I delay this now, after this agreement, it would only further endanger the life of this girl. Does that sound like something you expect me to do?
C: PATRICK
D: I'll accept responsibility for--
C: DOYLE
D: You' 11 accept-- Don' t come in here and get noble with me. Responsibility is earned. You can't take something you have no shoulder for.
N: He gathers his composure.
C: DOYLE
D: Let me see the note.
E: CONT' D
N: Patrick produces the note and the blanket.
C: DOYLE
D: Good God.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TACTICAL BRIEFING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: Remy and Nick stand with Patrick and Angie going over the RANSOM MAP which is tacked to the wall. Next to it are a geographical survey of the quarry and a street map of the surrounding area.
C: BRESSANT
D: They want to separate us. He points to diverging paths on the map.
C: BRESSANT
D: The note instructs you two to wait here on the south side for Amanda and Nick and I to be at the clearing by the edge with the money.
E: CONT'D
N: ( MORE ) BRESSANT (CONT'D) (BEAT) Once Amanda is turned over to you at your position, call us on the radio and we'll turn over the cash. Doyle, having been observing, interjects.
C: DOYLE
D: This man won't come alone. Who is he likely to bring?
C: PATRICK
D: Chris Mullen was in the apartment when we made the offer.
C: DOYLE
D: What do you know about him?
C: PATRICK
D: Well, it was probably him that killed Ray for Cheese. If I had to guess.
C: POOLE
D: He didn't ask you what you guessed. He asked you what do you know.
C: PATRICK
D: I know he's a six foot, thirty year old, caucasian heroin addict. And I know it was him, not Cheese, who rolled up Pokey Jackson and shot him in the head.
N: (BEAT) So there's that, too. Remy is the voice of reason today.
C: BRESSANT
D: I think we're all set here, Captain.
C: DOYLE
D: No one else knows about this, correct?
N: Angie has a concern.
C: ANGIE
D: I just wonder.. .
C: DOYLE
D: Yes?
E: turns to ask: 
C: ANGIE
D: Are we rationalizing this? I mean, wouldn't a hundred police up there be better for her than the four of us? Doyle stops.
C: DOYLE
D: What does that mean?
C: ANGIE
D: I'm asking if keeping this quiet is better for Amanda, or is it better for us?
N: Doyle is opaque.
C: DOYLE
D: Do you have any children, Miss Gennaro?
N: She shakes her head.
C: DOYLE
D: Then you've never lost one. My only child was murdered. She was twelve. You heard about it?
E: CONT'D
N: The question is rhetorical.
C: DOYLE
D: What you didn't hear, what you don' t know, is what that feels like.
E: CONT'D
N: There are articles on the wall. COP FATHER OF SLAIN CHILD VOWS: NEVER AGAIN. DOYLE ( CONT' D) What I live with? Is knowing my daughter likely died crying out for me to protect her, to come save her. (BEAT) And that I never came. (BEAT) She died afraid and alone, in a shallow ditch bank, a few feet from the road and not ten minutes from our house. Silence.
C: DOYLE
D: I know what it is- to lose my child. He now gets more upset than he usually does delivering this speech.
E: CONT'D
C: DOYLE
D: God damn it.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) You force my hand and then question the way I handle to it? Question me? BRESSANT (TO ANGIE) No one's questioning you. He relaxes a little.
C: DOYLE
D: I honor my daughter with this, this division, so no parent has to live what I've known . . .Not even a woman like Helene McCready .
N: (BEAT)
C: THAT GIRL--
D: is all I care about. And we're going to bring her home.
E: indicates photo of Amanda
S: EXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING QUINCY QUARRY - SUNSET
N: From the sky, lit by the last slivers of light from a setting sun, we see the Quincy quarry. It has become, in essence, a huge lake, set a hundred or so feet into a rock quarry and surrounded by acres of dense pine. As we travel past the quarry, we see PATRICK'S CAR IN A PARKING LOT. SUN JUST SET
S: EXT. QUARRY PARKING LOT -
N: The car idles. Patrick and Angie sit inside.
C: ANGIE
D: Why is he bringing us all the way up here?
C: PATRICK
D: Dark, big, make sure he can get away.
C: ANGIE
D: No. Something's wrong.
C: PATRICK
D: All he wants is the money. He just doesn't want to get arrested doing it.
C: ANGIE
D: They're gonna kill her. I can feel it. He looks out the window.
S: EXT QUARRY TRAIL - NIGHT
N: Angie, Patrick, Bressant, & Poole follow up a steep incline. Remy has the BAG OF MONEY.
C: POOLE
D: This asshole could have picked somewhere on level ground.
C: BRESSANT
D: Keep the lights off for now.
C: ANGIE
D: Is this where all the peak rocks have names?
C: PATRICK
D: (listing the names of the
N: PEAKS ) Running Tierny, Leo, Dan, Gooch, Jigger, Goreski and runnin' Mike.
C: POOLE
D: Where'd they get those fuckin' names?
C: PATRICK
D: From the kids who died tryin' to jump off em..
S: EXT. QUARRY TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER
N: More climbing. It starts to get steep. Some stones come loose underfoot and trickle downhill. We see that the quarry rocks are covered in the graffiti left by previous visitors. They walk in silence.
S: EXT QUARRY TOP - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
N: They CREST the hill. The city lights are behind them and we move to reveal the QUARRY WATER below and the edge before them. The path forks in two, opposite directions.
C: BRES SANT
D: This is where we part ways
E: to Patrick & Angie
N: POOLE (SMILES) Divide and conquer. ( CONT ' D)
C: POOLE
D: Be careful.
C: ANGIE
D: You be careful.
C: BRESSANT
D: Call us on the radio when you have her.
C: PATRICK
D: We will. Bressant cranes his neck. A nervous tick. Finally:
C: BRESSANT
D: Fuck it. And with that, he and Poole turn and head into the darkness.
N: - MOMENTS LATER
C: PATH
D: Patrick & Angie are on a steep incline. The vast openness of the quarry looms on their right. They climb still higher, finally arriving at 'rooftop.'
N: Patrick looks around. The view is breathtaking, but that isn't it. It doesn't make sense.
C: PATRICK
D: How are they gonna get Amanda to us up
C: HERE--
D: A SPLASH IN THE WATER breaks the silence--
N: GUNFIRE and TWO MUZZLES FLASH on the opposite side. Staccato voices come across the radio punctuated by gunfire. POOLE ( WALKIE ) Remy, Watch out! BRESSANT (WALKIE)
C: I HEARD A SPLASH!
D: Patrick and Angie take off running toward the gunfire.
S: EXT. QUARRY TRAIL CONTINUOUS
N: Patrick and Angie come flying down the trail, skittering and falling. At one point Patrick comes perilously close to the edge but rights himself. Their flashlights come on, bobbing up and down frantically as they make their way back to Poole and Bressant at a full on sprint. They can hear Poole and Bressant out loud now, without the walkies. POOLE (O.S.) SOMETHING WENT IN! BRESSANT (0.S) NICKY WATCH OUT! (BEAT)
C: THERE HE GOES!
D: More shots.
S: EXT. QUARRY, CLEARING CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER
N: Patrick and Angie run down the trail and approach a clearing. POOLE AND BRESSANT are near its edge, chests heaving, and frantically looking down into the quarry. Patrick TRIPS and goes flying, nearly LANDING on CHEESE'S BODY, shot dead.
C: ANGIE
D: Where did she fall!?
N: Patrick gets up and runs to the quarry edge.
C: POOLE
D: We heard it, too.
C: BRESSANT
D: First thing I saw was something went in.
C: ANGIE
D: Where is she?!
C: PATRICK
D: What happened?
C: BRESSANT
D: We got one, the other took off. Patrick and Angie scour the water with their flashlights.
C: PATRICK
D: Right there! SOMETHING IN THE WATER. A flash of something flesh-colored. The minute she sees it, Angie SAILS OUT OVER THE CLIFF AND
C: INTO THE WATER.
D: His flashlight finds ANGIE SWIMMING DETERMINEDLY toward something. He scans and sees what she's after: AMANDA'S DOLL
N: FLOATING IN THE WATER.

N: She DIVES beneath the surface . . . And finally emerges near the edge of the lake. She grabs hold of an outcropping. In her other hand she holds AMANDA'S DOLL, MIRABELLE . We move in on Angie, clutching the nightgown and the doll -- shivering in the frigid, black water.
T: DISSOLVE :
N: INT. ANGIErS HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Angie is in bed watching a news report, her leg bandaged from being slashed open on the rocks. Before Patrick enters we move in a long lens, near macro shot along Angie, beginning on darkness, then onto her bandaged leg, across the arm with an IV in it, stained by iodine and resting on her face.
C: PATRICK
D: Is your leg alright?
C: ANGIE
D: It will be. You hear anything?
C: PATRICK
D: Cops found no one up there. Shocker. I guess as soon as they had the money, someone shot Cheese and another guy came out shootin'. They must have tossed her in.
C: ANGIE
D: Why?
C: PATRICK
D: I don't know. She saw their faces. For some people that's enough.
C: ANGIE
D: But you and me could recognize Chris.
C: PATRICK
D: Remy said the other two kids were black. So it wasn't Chris.
C: ANGIE
D: Have they found her?
C: PATRICK
D: No, but they got divers up there now, so.. .
C: ANGIE
D: Then she could be alive. She could be hiding. She could be stuck . . .
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah but, the one cop told me that two years ago some guy killed his wife and dumped her in there-- the divers found the body . . .but it was so dark they lost it and then they could never find it again. There's so many crags and outcroppings and old cars and shit.
N: (BEAT) So don't get your hopes up. He sees she is crying.
C: PATRICK
D: Oh, hey. It's okay. I know.
E: CONT'D
N: She bends over, more emotional pain than physical. She curls her knee up to her chin, holds her abdomen, in obvious pain. Patrick climbs into bed with her, wraps her in his arms.
C: ANGIE
D: I'm sorry. . . I'm sorry. .

PATRICK (V. ) There were others who didn't share their gifts for stoicism. A small mounted photo of Amanda sits in an empty and impossibly small casket. Helene starts to rock back and forth, then lets it go-- a fountain of grief and a future of unending pain. PATRICK (V. ) (CONT'D) They called off the search and issued Helene a death certificate. She elected to have a memorial service with a child's casket there as a symbol. The guilt, shame and agony inside Helene, finally found their way out.

N: Bressant throws the radio on his seat and starts for the house. As he goes, he turns back to Patrick. BRESSANT (CONT' D) (GENUINE) Nice job. As they reach the sidewalk out front, Bressant cuts across the yard toward the side of the house. Poole heads for the front door. Bressant does a ONE ARM COCK of the shotgun before disappearing from Patrick's sight.
S: EXT. TRETT HOUSE CONTINUOUS
N: Poole rings the buzzer and steps back.. SHOTS FIRE THROUGH THE DOOR and clip into Poole. It seems almost too clumsy to be real. He falls over, holding his neck. A moment of STUNNED SILENCE, then: Patrick runs from the car. Staying low, he races for the cover of the FRONT YARD OF THE HOUSE.
C: BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG
D: Patrick TRIPS taking cover and is splayed across the muddy grass, looks over his shoulder.
N: Patrick reaches Poole and lies on top of him. He messily checks for a pulse, gets smeared with blood. Poole is torn up. Several rounds hit where the vest wasn't, including his neck. He grunts. Patrick fumbles for his cell phone.
C: PATRICK
D: There's an officer shot. Shots fired. An officer down at Two-nine-zero German St.
E: he looks up at the door
N: Patrick hears shots from inside. He leaves his phone by Poole and heads inside. HOWLING can be heard from within.
S: INT TRETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The foyer floor is spattered with blood. He cautiously moves forward. Into a completely bare room. He moves to the hallway. Just inside the hall a BODY lies motionless on its stomach. Patrick inches through the door, crouches next to the body, and cranes his head. It's Leon Trett: DEAD. Patrick momentarily pauses to examine Leon.
C: BOOM
D: A GUNSHOT explodes and a SLUG rips into the wall above Patrick's head, showering him in plaster. Looking up, he sees Roberta Trett at the far end of the hall gripping her revolver.
N: BOOM BOOM, two more shots bury into the wall. ROBERTA (ENRAGED) GET AWAY FROM HIM! GET AWAY FROM LEON! She CHARGES. Patrick whips open a door opposite the one he just came through and leaps out of the hallway . . . And TRIPS up a staircase SMACKING HIS FACE against the wood. . . Roberta FIRES UP AT HIM. He scrambles up the stairs and crashes his body against a STEEL DOOR at the top. It flies open and he tumbles through.
S: INT. CORWIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Patrick spins over and kicks the door closed. He springs to his feet, throws his body against the door, and locks it with the heavy DEAD BOLT on the POLICE DOOR. WHAM. Roberta slams into the other side of the door with everything she's got. She does it again, WHAM. And again, WHAM. But the door holds. Patrick turns to survey his surroundings. Patrick moves to ANOTHER ROOM outfitted with a COFFEE TABLE piled high with empty beer cans, a frayed COUCH, a small TV. The room connects to a small BEDROOM. Patrick steps toward. A SOILED, BARE MATTRESS lies in one corner. Patrick steps in, his gun raised . . . And finds himself staring directly into the face of:
C: CORWIN EARLE.
D: Crouched on the floor, naked from the waist down and wearing a half-shirt. His stare is bug-eyed & frightened. Corwin stares at Patrick, scared.
C: PATRICK
D: Don' t move.
C: CORWIN EARLE
D: It was an accident.
N: He looks up at Patrick like a whipped dog, eyes shifting nervously to the door. Patrick cautiously pushes open the door to the bathroom. He looks in the sink. There are bloody children's underwear soaking. Then Patrick looks in the BATHTUB.
C: BLACK.
D: And sees, curled in the fetal position, SAMUEL PIETRO, gagged, bound and suffocated. His bluish face frozen in a scream.
C: BLACK.
D: The blood rushes from Patrick's head. He retches violently.
C: BLACK
D: Close on Corwin, really scared. Really sorry.
C: CORWIN EARLE
D: I didn't mean to.
E: CONT' D
C: BLACK.

D: Hey. . . She puts her hand up to his face, the side of his head.

N: Patrick exits the front door of the Hospital and walks toward Remy, drinking from a bottle in a paper bag, who looks up at Patrick.
C: BRESSANT
D: It's fucked up, right?
C: PATRICK
D: They tell you anything about Nick?
C: BRESSANT
D: They say he could be okay. I don't know.
N: Bressant hands Patrick the bottle. Patrick sits down next to him. There is a beat. He drinks.
C: PATRICK
D: How old did they say the kid was?
C: BRESSANT
D: Seven.
C: PATRICK
D: Second grade.
C: BRESSANT
D: You should be proud of yourself. Most men would have stayed outside.
C: PATRICK
D: It doesn't matter.
N: BRESSANT ( KNOWING) Yes it does.
C: PATRICK
D: I had a priest who always said, "shame is God's voice telling us where we did wrong. "
C: BRESSANT
D: Fuck him, you did good.
C: PATRICK
D: Murder is a sin.
C: BRESSANT
D: Depends on who you do it to.
N: PATRICK (QUIET MATTER-OF-FACT) It don't work like that. It is what it is. Bressant sees Patrick is struggling.
C: BRESSANT
D: I planted evidence on a guy once.
N: (BEAT) We got a call from our pal Ray Likanski. Back in '95 we were paying a hundred an eight ball to snitches. He couldn't find enough guys to rat out. Anyway, he tells us there's a guy pumpin' out of an apartment in Colombia point. Me and Nick go in-- this was fifteen years ago; when Nicky went in, it was no joke. (BEAT) So it's a stash house, the old lady is beat to shit and the husband is mean, cracked out, tries to give us trouble. Nick takes him down. We' re doin' an inventory but it looks like we missed it cause there's no dope in the house. I go in the back room, now this place was a shit-hole, mind you, rats and roaches all over the place, but the kid's room in the back is spotless. He swept it, mopped it. Immaculate. The kid is sitting there, holding on to his Playstation for dear life, no expression, tears streaming down his face. He wants to tell me how he just learned his multiplication tables.
C: PATRICK
D: Jesus.
C: BRESSANT
D: The father has the kid living in a crack den, subsisting on twinkles and ass- whippings and the kid is still asking me, "is my daddy all right?"
N: (BEAT) You're worried about what's Christian? Kids forgive, they don't judge, they turn the other cheek. (MORE)
C: BRESSANT
D: What do they get for it?
E: CONT' D
N: (BEAT) I went back out and put an ounce of heroin on the living room floor. Sent the father on a ride. Seven to nine.
C: PATRICK
D: Think you did the right thing?
C: BRESSANT
D: I don't give a fuck. You take a side. You beat a child, you molest a child, you hurt a child -- you ain't on my side. And hope you don't run into me because I will lay you the fuck down. Easy.
C: PATRICK
D: Doesn' t feel easy.
C: BRESSANT
D: Look, was he better off without the father? Yes. But okay, the kid might be out there, pumpin7 with a gun in his waistband. It's a war. Are we winning? No. Look, I got a great wife, money saved, hit my 30 in three months, pick up that pension and hail a fucking cab. Go down

D: Let it go.
C: PATRICK
D: Let what go?
C: ANGIE
D: I don't care about Remy. I don't care if he's crooked. We don't need any more of this. It's enough.
C: PATRICK
D: After what we been through? You want me to 'let it go?'
C: ANGIE
D: Yes.
C: PATRICK
D: Something has to be wrong. He lied to me. What we've been through we deserve to know the truth. She looks at him.
C: ANGIE
D: Why? Why is it important? Amanda's dead- fuck the rest of them. Crooked, liars, I don' t care.
C: PATRICK
D: What do you want?
C: ANGIE

N: He sighs.
C: DEVIN
D: Helene and Ray took Cheese's money in June. A week later, Remy came to a cop in DCU, asking if anyone knew who robbed Cheese. The story went around like: that's how good Remy was.
E: CONT' D
C: PATRICK
D: Why?
C: DEVIN
D: 'Cause our informant told us- Cheese didn't even know the money was stolen until two weeks later.
C: PATRICK
D: How did Remy find out that quick?
N: Devin stands with his coffee, laughs a little.
C: DEVIN
D: If I knew that, I wouldn't be here talkin' to you. And be sure on how far you want to go with this--
N: (BEAT) You start investigating Police it's a whole other level. You try to take food out of their mouths they will fuck you UP - He smiles.

S: INT. PATRICK &
N: Patrick is talking to Angie.
C: PATRICK
D: Trust me. I know I'm right. He lied to us because he didn't want us to know he knew Ray. That' s the whole thing.
C: ANGIE
D: And how is it possible that he could know the money was stolen before anyone else.
C: PATRICK
D: The same way everyone in this neighborhood knows everyone else's business.
N: (BEAT) Someone tells them. She looks dubious.
C: ANGIE
D: This is reckless. It's one thing to get obsessed yourself because that's what you need to go through-- but this man lost, basically, his child. If you do this, you better fuckin' be right.
C: PATRICK
D: I understand that. I'm not asking you to believe I'm right. I'm asking you to believe in me.

D: Hello.

E: ON PHONE
C: LIONEL
D: Can it wait?
C: PATRICK
D: No. There is a pause. Something in Patrick's tone stops Lionel.
E: ON PHONE
C: LIONEL
D: Can you meet me at Murphy's Law? It's on Summer.
C: PATRICK
D: Fifteen minutes, Lionel.
C: LIONEL
D: All right. I'm coming.
S: EXT. DORCHESTER ST. - DUSK SETTING IN
N: Colin Hay' s "The Water Song" plays. The day has died. Muted yellow lights appear in windows. The coming dark promises a deepening chill. Children have disappeared from the street to wash up for dinner. Liquor stores and nail salons are half empty and listless. Horns honk sporadically and a storefront gate rattles as it drops. In the faces of people on the street you can see the weight of the morning's unfulfilled promise in the numb sag of their faces.
S: EXT. MURPHY'S LAW - SUNSET
N: From a high angle, we see the bar. From the car we see Patrick and Angie wait in their car outside Murphy's Law. They see Lionel approach and head into the bar.
S: INT. MURPHY'S LAW - DUSK SETTING IN
N: 2 TEAMSTERS share a bottle of whiskey at the bar while 3 SECRETARIES chat nearby. A BARTENDER works with a WAITRESS. Near the back door, TWO MEN throw darts. Patrick, Angie and Lionel sit around a table in the middle of the bar. Lionel stares at his hands.
C: PATRICK
D: How long you known Remy?
C: LIONEL
D: Detective Bressant?
N: (LIAR'S PAUSE) Just, in, met him through the investigation of Amanda.

N: Lionel puts up his hands.
C: LIONEL
D: Fine. Fine.
N: (BEAT) I haven't been honest with you. It's just not something I'm proud of, you know? I was in a bar fight, in the day. The other guy cracked his skull. At some point, I musta said, "I' 11 kill you." So they had me up for attempted. My word against the other guy's. A witness testified to my version and the jury believed him.
C: PATRICK
D: 'Cause he was a cop.
C: LIONEL
D: Yeah. He testified for me. Angie starts to believe Lionel might be lying.
C: ANGIE
D: Why didn't you mention that?
C: LIONEL
D: I was embarrassed.
C: PATRICK
D: Bullshit. You bragged about taking a hard bust the first day we met you.
C: LIONEL
D: No I didn't.
C: PATRICK
D: So you knew 'Detective Bressant.'
C: LIONEL
D: It's not like we were best friends.

C: PATRICK
D: Go.
C: LIONEL
D: In May I came up to check on Amanda. She was alone, as usual. I was reading her a story when Helene and Ray came home. They didn't know I was there and they started talking about how they had robbed this drug dealer. Then they talked about leaving the state. I called Remy and told him.
C: PATRICK
D: Then what? Lionel pours another shot down his throat, gathers himself.
C: LIONEL
D: Then we took her.
N: (BEAT) Remy laid out this plan, it seemed easy. We take her, force Helene and Ray to cough up the money, and then put her back. You know? Amanda gets a weekend in the country; My sister learns a lesson; And fuck it, we'll all get paid on top of it . . . I got no problem taking money from a guy like Cheese. (PAUSE) They were gonna handle the cops, but Bea went nuts calling the papers and hired you. Once you found the money they had Amanda and the money. So they decided to set up a fake exchange for you to witness. They got Chris Mullen to set Cheese up at the quarry for 15k and a chance to be the boss. Even though it was too late, Cheese figured out what was happening and started shooting. You have to understand, I never been around that. Everyone was panickin' and she . . . (A BEAT) . . . she got scared and she ran. (ANOTHER BEAT) And she just fell in. OVER THE PREVIOUS DIALOGUE WE PLAY FLASHES:
C: ANGIE
D: She was your sister's kid, Lionel.
N: (BEAT) Your sister's c h i l d .
C: LIONEL
D: You don't think I miss her? She was more my kid than Helene's.
N: (BEAT) Last summer, Helene and Dottie took Amanda to the beach. Real hot day. Amanda fell asleep and they left her in the car to go off with some guys in the dunes. For two hours. Amanda literally roasted. She was t h r e e . He listens skeptically.
C: LIONEL
D: My sister called me up later that night because Amanda was, " b e i n q a r e a l b i t c h . "
E: CONT' D
N: (PAUSE) When I got over there I found my niece in the bathtub, schriekin' in pain and she reeked, like beer. The best my sister could come up with to ease her daughter's pain was to douse her in cold beer. But not all of it, she wanted to "save some." Long exhale.
C: LIONEL
D: Later on, I was holding her, trying to help her sleep, and she was so hot she felt like something just outta the oven... Like a fuckinr pot r o a s t .
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) So don't feel too sorry for my sister. She never cared about anyone but herself. A COMMOTION draws their attention to the front door. A MAN WEARING A POPEYE MASK stands just inside the door brandishing a shotgun. POPEYE (TO BARTENDER) YOU! THE SAFE . . . NOW! (pointing with his gun) Right under there. The bartender does as he's told -- sliding open a door beneath the bar to reveal a safe.
C: POPEYE
D: Everyone needs to shut up. I'll be done in two minutes. You get down on the floor. Hands behind your head! Just relax.
E: CONT'D to the dart players
N: A woman starts to panic.
C: WOMAN AT BAR
D: Oh, god, no.
C: POPEYE
D: This will all be over in a minute if everyone stays calm.
C: TEAMSTER
D: Do you know who's bar this is, shit-head?
N: Popeye CRACKS the teamster in the jaw with the butt of his shotgun.
C: POPEYE
D: Or you can get wise. It's up to you. The bartender places a STACK OF BILLS on the bar -- 2 or 3 grand. Popeye throws a DUFFLE BAG at him and he fills it.
C: DART PLAYER
D: We got families.
C: POPEYE
D: Pipe down.
N: He turns to Lionel.
C: POPEYE
D: What did you say?!
E: CONT'D
N: Nobody said anything.
C: POPEYE
D: Another smart guy?
E: CONT' D
N: The bar is silent. POPEYE (CONT'D) (TO LIONEL) You1re a talker, huh? Keep yapping motherfucker.
C: WOMAN AT BAR
D: Stop antagonizing him! He has a gun.
N: POPEYE (TO LIONEL) You want to keep talking trash? Okay. DART PLAYER
C: SHUT UP!
D: Even though Lionel has said nothing, every witness at the bar would remember it this way. That Lionel had been talking and he had been killed. Popeye SNAPS THE ROUND INTO THE CHAMBER WITH ONE HAND.
N: HE CRANES HIS NECK On Patrick, this rings a bell. From the Tretts. . . Popeye is Bressant. Bressant levels the shotgun at Lionel. POPEYE (TO LIONEL) Close your eyes, Mouth. Close 'em tight.
C: LIONEL
D: You don't have to do this
N: PATRICK REMY BRESSANT. Bressant looks at him, then sticks the shotgun between Lionel' s eyes.
C: LIONEL
D: Wait. Jesus.
E: his eyes shut
C: PATRICK
D: Amanda McCready was taken by Remy Bressant !
C: BRESSANT
D: Don't say that fucking name!
C: LIONEL
D: I already told him we did it for ransom. I told him we did it for ransom! Remy . . . Please. Ill.
C: BRESSANT
D: Fuck. . . His heart isn't in it. He begins to lower his gun
C: BANG! BANG!
D: TWO SHOTS HIT Bressant. He takes a beat to register this, standing stock-still. The Bartender is standing there with a smoking gun, in shock. Patrick leaps out of his chair and drives his head into Bressant's stomach. Wrapping his arms around his waist, he plows his spine straight back into the bar.
N: Bressant cracks the shotgun stock down onto the back of Patrick's neck, buckling his knees and crashing him to the floor. He SCRAMBLES OUT the front door. Patrick gets to his feet and looks around. Angie is okay. Patrick turns and RACES out the front door after Bressant. Angie goes to Lionel's side.
C: SECRETARY
D: Call 911! Call 911!
S: EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Patrick looks up and down the street, but Bressant is nowhere to be seen. He sees a BLOODY POPEYE MASK on the ground. A TRAIL OF BLOOD runs away from it which Patrick follows across the street. The thickening trail leads Patrick along the side of a LARGE 3-STORY FACTORY (in the process of being converted to lofts) and to a DOOR near the back. Blood is smeared on the door and a small red puddle has formed on the ground.
S: INT FACTORY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
N: Leading with his gun, Patrick steps into a bright STAIRWELL. Blood tracks up the stairs and Patrick ascends cautiously. He climbs one flight. And then another -- pausing on the landing. Above him, light comes through an OPEN DOOR. He starts for it. Patrick continues up the last few steps. He reaches the top and peers out onto:
S: EXT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
N: Patrick scans the roof for Remy. He sees nothing on his right and turns around to his left, circling the stairwell. Behind him we see a magnificent view of the neighborhood. He turns another corner to see: Bressant sits against an aluminum vent - - his head leaned back and his eyes half closed. A ROSE OF BLOOD spreads out against Bressant's shirt. His flesh is beginning to grey. Patrick holds his gun on him and calls out.
C: PATRICK
D: Put the fuckin' gun down! Put it down.
N: Remy has his gun on his lap. He lets it fall to his side.
C: BRESSANT
D: That bartender wasn't fuckin' around.
N: Patrick kicks away the gun.
C: PATRICK
D: Fuck you. You let this little girl die. You want to tell me how to live?
N: Patrick looks at Remy.
C: PATRICK
D: 'Do your best.' Fuck you, this is my best.
E: CONT' D
N: Bressant wags his head a little
C: BRESSANT
D: I know.
C: PATRICK
D: You know? You let a girl go off a cliff. What do you know? You don't know.
N: Bressant just smiles at him. ( CONT ' D)
C: PATRICK
D: She was a child--
N: Remy gives him a long, strange look. Then:
C: BRESSANT
D: Yeah.
N: (BEAT) ( MORE )
C: BRESSANT
D: I could never have kids. I told my wife to marry someone else. She wouldn't do it. I love children.
E: CONT'D beat, distant
N: Bressant is fading. Patrick stands over him. Oddly peaceful, Bressant gives Patrick a kind smile. BRESSANT ( CONT' D) I like you, Patrick. You get to Florida, look me up. Patrick looks at him.
C: BRESSANT
D: Let me see the city.
E: CONT'D
N: Patrick stands there. Bressant looks out at Boston, rising steel and glass in the setting August sun. Autumn is almost at hand and the crispness of the air makes the view all the more sad. Bressant makes a guttural sound, appreciating the last thing he'll see. Patrick looks at him, dying. Not how he expected this to end. CRANE starts on Remy, up to Patrick, then pulls far above both them and the city. DISSOLVE OVER THE ROOFTOP IN THE SETTING SUN (CRANE)
S: INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: Patrick sits in a chair. Present are the NEW CAPTAIN (57) and a BEEFY OFFICER (50) with a crew cut. They sit around a desk, informally. Patrick is not charged with anything but rather is being questioned routinely (hence, no lawyer) .
C: PATRICK
D: Why would I expose a conspiracy I was a part of?
N: (BEAT) Did Lionel contradict anything I said? Did the witnesses? The Captain stands.
C: CAPTAIN
D: A Police officer was killed today. That's not looked on lightly.
C: PATRICK
D: Is corruption looked on lightly?
C: BEEFY OFFICER
D: You got a smart mouth.
C: PATRICK
D: How is getting a little girl killed looked on?
C: CAPTAIN
D: We'd like to ensure that you're telling us the truth. Is that all right with you? Hot shit?
C: PATRICK
D: It's fine, hot shit.
C: CAPTAIN
D: So, after setting up Jean Baptiste, your friend Chris Mullen was coincidentally killed? And you didn't have nothing to do with it?
C: PATRICK
D: He was probably killed by Sgt. Detective Remy Bressant or anyone else who wanted the 130K in his backpack.
N: (BEAT) He's not my friend.
C: BEEFY OFFICER
D: You charge money as a detective. But you were at the quarry and yet you had no idea it was a set up?
C: PATRICK
D: I trust the Police when they tell me something. And I had a fake ransom note and Amanda's blanket the cops left in my mailbox. And I heard the tape from when Cheese, or I guess it was Chris pretending to be Cheese, called the station.
C: CAPTAIN
D: A 911 call?
C: PATRICK
D: No. The call into the station from Cheese to Remy.
C: CAPTAIN
D: We don't tape calls into the station.
N: (BEAT) And we don't do transcripts, smart guy. Beat. This causes Patrick to register something.
C: BEEFY OFFICER
D: Did you hear a tape?
C: PATRICK
D: No.
C: BEEFY OFFICER
D: Did you see a transcript?
C: PATRICK
D: I must have remembered it wrong. Remy read it to me.
N: The Police look at him.
C: PATRICK
D: Look, I've cooperated. Unless you want me to go out there and start calling the papers to give 'em my Police corruption exclusive, I'm leaving.
E: CONT' D
N: He gets up.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Calm down.
N: (BEAT) You're released. But Mr. Kenize-- (WINKS) I hope you don't get pulled over any time soon.
S: INT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Patrick comes into the office/living room. Angie is there.
C: ANGIE
D: What happened?
C: PATRICK
D: They kept my shoelaces.
N: She smiles.
C: ANGIE
D: We'll go down to Zayre's tomorrow and get you some new ones.
C: PATRICK
D: I don't want to do that tomorrow.
C: ANGIE
D: What do you want to do?
C: PATRICK
D: Take a trip.
S: EXT MASS TURNPIKE - DAY
N: The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick forests of pine trees. Inside the car it's quiet. Patrick's stare is fixed to the road -- the rhythm of the white lines that pulse by. Angie rests her head against the passenger window, the BLUR of the tree-line reflected in her eyes.
S: EXT . RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY
N: A 2-LANE ROAD winds them through rolling hills and past a SIGN welcoming them to: 'WEST BECKETT, MA. Pop. 974' -- a Rockwell painting in the heart of the Berkshire Mountains.
S: EXT TOWNSEND ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
N: The car rolls down a quiet road where small COTTAGES nestle in clumps of birch and pine trees. Patrick parks opposite a long driveway. A MAILBOX at its mouth reads: DOYLE ROAD - AFTERNOON
S: EXT. TOWNSEND
N: Patrick and Angie sit in the car. They look down a driveway. She takes a beat.
C: ANGIE
D: You want to tell me where our trip has taken us?
C: PATRICK
D: You know where we are.
N: ANGIE (BEAT) He would never, ever do something to endanger a child.
C: PATRICK
D: Are you sure?
C: ANGIE
D: Yes.
C: PATRICK
D: He was a part of it. They don't tape calls. He handed us a transcript like it was evidence and he knew it was a forgery- -maybe he forged it himself. He knew what they were doing, he supported it and he covered it up.
C: ANGIE
D: Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty grand? What for?
N: He just looks at her.
C: PATRICK
D: Had to be for something.
C: ANGIE
D: When you're talking about ruining an old man who lost his child and gave years of service . . . "something" isn't enough.
C: PATRICK
D: For a guy who tried to ruin us, something' s plenty.
C: ANGIE
D: This is the kind of thing where if you do it, you want to be sure.
N: (BEAT) Are you sure?
C: PATRICK
D: No.
N: (BEAT) Are you coming?
C: ANGIE
D: No.
N: And he goes down the road.
S: EXT DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: They start down the driveway towards a small, red cottage set a hundred yards or so off the road. But after only a few steps, they stop. PATRICK & ANGIE'S POV: Through the trees, Doyle emerges from the cottage. He carries 2 FULL SUITCASES to a SUBURBAN and loads them in the back. His wife, FRANCINE, follows. Patrick & Angie take a beat before resuming down the drive. Only to FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS at the sight of: AMANDA MCCREADY CHARGING ONTO THE PORCH, clutching a BACK- PACK, and wearing a look of utter determination.
C: AMANDA
D: Don't forget mine, gramma.
C: FRANCINE
D: I'd never forget yours, sweetheart. Doyle lifts Amanda off the porch and carries her to the Suburban. He dips down, allowing Amanda to place her back- pack inside.
C: AMANDA
D: Can I have a, please a sandwich?
C: DOYLE
D: What kind do you want.
C: AMANDA
D: Grill Cheese.
C: DOYLE
D: You like the crusts on, right?
C: AMANDA
D: Noooo! I don't like the crusts on!
E: thrilled with this game
N: DOYLE (FAKES REMEMBERING) That' s right, that's right. Patrick and Angie have ducked into the woods. They are both in shock.
C: PATRICK
D: Jesus.
C: ANGIE
D: She's alive.
N: SERIES OF FLASHBACKS SHOWING WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN EXTREMELY QUICK SUCCESSION.
S: - EXT. TOWNSEND ROAD - AFTERNOON
N: Patrick walks down Doyle's driveway toward the car. Angie is sitting, leaned up against the hood, he head tilted forward. As Patrick draws near, she lifts her head up to him and we see she has been crying. This isn't what Patrick expected and he is taken aback for a beat, long enough for Angie to say:
C: ANGIE
D: She's happy.
C: PATRICK
D: No.. .
C: ANGIE
D: She' s happy here.
N: (BEAT) I saw her.
C: PATRICK
D: Angie, don't do this.
C: ANGIE
D: If you call the Police they'll send her back.
C: PATRICK
D: I need you on my side.
C: ANGIE
D: I am on your side but I can't send her back.
C: PATRICK
D: We're not sending her anywhere. That's her mother. She has a right to her child.
C: ANGIE
D: He's better for her.
C: PATRICK
D: Why? Because he has money and makes sandwiches?
N: ANGIE
C: SIMPLY)
D: Because he loves her.
C: PATRICK
D: Helene loves her, too.
C: ANGIE
D: No.
C: PATRICK
D: She might learn from this.
C: ANGIE
D: No. People don't change.
N: Angle grows more impassioned.
C: ANGIE
D: Helene is arsenic. She'll kill her. She'll burn the life out of her.
E: CONT'D
C: PATRICK
D: You can't take away someone's kid.
C: ANGIE
D: I don't want to. I want to leave their child with them.
C: PATRICK
D: ~ l this time we wanted to bring her
N: home. Why is that wrong now?
C: ANGIE
D: Because I know right and wrong when I see it.
C: PATRICK
D: I need you to understand me right now. I need you to love me and say I know this is a hard decision but I stand by you. I need you to take me home and make this okay.
C: ANGIE
D: I can do that. I can take you home and I know how to make it okay.
N: (BEAT) (MORE)
C: ANGIE
D: It will be okay because every now and again we'll talk about her and where she might be and what grade she's in and we'll be proud of her and that will be okay.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Because we'll know she's in a good school and safe and has sleep overs and birthday parties and smiles every day. (BEAT) And maybe sometime we'll drive out here and watch a softball game with a teenager in it from the back bleachers and we'll see how much she's grown. And then I'll take you home and we' 11 know it's okay.
C: PATRICK
D: You can't ask me to do something I can't do.
C: ANGIE
D: You can't ask me to live with it,
N: She makes a plea.
C: ANGIE
D: Patrick, for me. Please?
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) I'll hate you for doing it. I don't want to but I will. She walks away, leaving him alone by the side of the road.
S: EXT. DOYLE SUMMER COTTAGE, DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: We push in, approaching Doyle who turns to see Patrick. Doyle watches Patrick. He offers a measured greeting.
C: DOYLE
D: Patrick Kenzie. To what do I owe the pleasure?
N: He holds Doyle's look.
C: PATRICK
D: Remy Bressant died last night.
C: DOYLE
D: I was told. It's a shame.
C: PATRICK
D: Hard to understand. He seemed like a good man.
C: DOYLE
D: He was a good man. You don't know why people do what they do. Only they see out their own windows. With that, AMANDA walks out the door, running to Jack and clinging to his leg. Jack holds Patrick's look.
C: AMANDA
D: Papapa. Come make sandwiches now please.
N: Doyle smiles, giving away nothing of his tension with Patrick. Francine comes to the door. DOYLE (TO FRANCINE) It's all right. (TO AMANDA) Go inside, my sweet. I'll be there soon and make you a sandwich. Francine hesitates. Doyle is gentle.
C: DOYLE
D: I'm all right. Francine takes her back inside.
E: CONT'D
N: A beat. Doyle smiles.
C: DOYLE
D: So you know. Good for you. You uncovered the thing men died for.
E: CONT'D
C: PATRICK
D: Men killed for.
C: DOYLE
D: I'm giving that little girl a life.
C: PATRICK
D: It's not your life to give. Helene is her mother. You think she's a bad mother you should have gone to social services. Short of that, it's her mother, it's where she belongs.
C: DOYLE
D: Turn around, get back in your car and wait thirty years. You don't know what the world is made of yet.
C: PATRICK
D: I know I'm tired of being lied to and tired of being lectured by a gang of criminals. I'm calling the State Police in five minutes. They'll be here in ten.
C: DOYLE
D: No.
N: (BEAT) You haven't made that call because you think it might be an irreparable mistake. Because part of you believes it doesn't matter what the rules say. Because you know, when the lights go out and it's just you and your conscience you ask yourself if she's better here or better there, you know the answer and you always will.
C: PATRICK
D: See you at the arraignment.
C: DOYLE
D: You can do one good pure thing here today. One right thing. Most men don't get that chance in a lifetime.
N: (BEAT) You walk away from that, you may not regret it when you get home, or in a year but I promise you, get to where I am, you will. But I'll be dead by then, you'll be old, and she'll be trailing a ragged, tattered childhood of her own -- and you'll be the one who has to tell them you' re sorry.
C: PATRICK
D: Then I guess I will. I'll tell them I'm sorry and I'll live with it. And maybe that will happen, what I'm not gonna do, is have to apologize to a grown woman who says, why did you leave me? I got kidnapped, my aunt hired you to find me, and you did. You found me with a strange family but you broke your promise and you left me there. Why? Why didn't you bring me home?
N: (MORE)
C: PATRICK
D: It don't matter how many outfits and snacks and family trips we took-- they weren't my family, they stole me and I was raised as a stranger to myself and the life I would have had. You knew about it, you knew better and you did nothing. And maybe that grown woman will forgive me but I won't forgive myself.
E: CONT' D
N: Silence . . . It hangs in the air.
C: PATRICK
D: The only thing I care about is that little girl. And I'm gonna bring her home. Doyle hears this. Has his reaction, something like a sagging, an emptiness, and a resolution.
E: CONT'D
N: DOYLE
C: I STILL
D: Then you'll have to excuse me. have a sandwich left to make.
N: He turns and walks inside. SAME - LATER Patrick watches from down the road. Doyle is on the porch. Jack sits in his favorite chair. Amanda is on his lap, facing him, arms around his shoulders, head tucked into his neck. He slowly rocks the chair. He holds Amanda like its the last hug of his life. His eyes are fixed on a point somewhere far off in the distance. Patrick takes out his phone. In the distance sirens wail faintly, getting louder. Just inside the door is Amanda's colorful kids back-pack, a strange and cute stuffed snake, and Francine's bag spilling over with zip-locked snacks and children's cups-- all the stuff Francine had packed to make sure Amanda would have, whereever she'd go. Over this all, beginning faintly and growing increasingly audible, is the inanity of the television news. It's blather like a merciless blanket of idiocy over something hopelessly sad. A swarm of West Beckett POLICE CRUISERS cram the small road. A Deputy knocks on the door. Doyle answers. He knows the local cops' who are embarrassed to arrest him. He makes it easy for them. Doyle nods at the deputy with quiet acceptance and the dignity of a man at peace with the choices h e r s made. The DEPUTY puts a hand-cuffed Doyle into the back of his car. Francine Doyle silently mouthing! "oh my God' oh my God." Angie looks out from the car' past the policef past everything. They move to Francine to put her in a police car. Amandal being taken from Francine' cries and reaches out to her. She screams. Francine is handcuffed. Patrick tries to hold his look. Patrick stands with a GROUP OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. He looks to Angie . . . She doesn' t look back.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT HELENE'S APARTMENT - EVENING
N: The crush of media has descended outside the apartment for footage of the joyous reunion. Helene is made up. She waits on the curb as the POLICE CAR arrives. Out gets a FEMALE OFFICERr holding Amandar who is terrified by the rapacious mob of REPORTERS AND PHOTOGWPHERS. Amanda's fear of the throng causes her to cling to Helenel giving the photographers the shot they want. Patrick watches from his car' parked up the block. He is alone. ADDITIONAL STREET MONTAGE IMAGES FEATURING PATRICK He is in the neighborhood.
S: EXT. CITY STRETT - SUNSET
N: Patrick drives. He sees the ITALIAN MAN (Gerry Speca) and they trade looksl once again' 40 fps as he drives by. ANGIE'S APT - EVENING
S: INT PATRICK &
N: Patrick comes home. Boxes are packed. The place feels less warm. More bare. A voice from the doorway turns him around. It's Angie.
C: ANGIE
D: Sorryr I had to come back and get some stuff.
C: PATRICK
D: It's okay. She looks at himl almost sympathetic.
N: PATRICK ( CONT ' D) Can we at least talk?
C: ANGIE
D: There's nothing to say
N: She smiles' maybe some water pooling at the corners of her eyes. After a beat' looking at herl he steps aside. She moves past him and out the door. ANGIE'S APTr KITCHEN - LATER
S: INT. PATRICK &
N: Patrick sits at the kitchen table. On the TVl Helene is talking to the press. Pull back to reveal Patrick watching her at his kitchen table.
C: HELENE
D: I just want to say God bless. God bless. To all the police and . . .the firemen . . . I just feel like nine-eleven right now...
E: ON TV
S: EXT. CEMETERY DUSK
N: Watching from afar as Bressant is buried. In contrast to Mount Auburn' this is a pitiful little place. His WIFE (the former prostitute) and a few scant mourners stand by. A PRIEST delivers the eulogy. It begins to rain. END MUSIC CUE:
T: DISSOLVE :
S: INT HELENE'S APARTMENT EVENING
N: In the LIVING ROOM' Amanda is plunked on the couch staring blankly at a SITCOMf sharing none of the studio audience's enthusiasm. Patrick stands just inside the front door watching her. HELENE (0. . ) I'm sorry for being rude' but I gotta be outta here in like two minutes. Patrick doesn't answer' his gaze fixed on Amanda. She finally looks up at him. Patrick SMILES at her.
C: PATRICK
D: Hi.
N: Amanda looks at him' blankly. She returns her attention to the TV. HELENE (0.. ) You think hef11 like me? Patrick looks over to Helene standing in the doorwayf all dolled up -- striking a pose. She wears too much makeup. Her clothes reveal too much of what she hasn't got.
C: PATRICK
D: Who?
C: HELENE
D: My date.
C: PATRICK
D: I'm sure he will.
C: HELENE
D: Aww' you' re sweet. He seen me on my American Victim and he wrote me letters and I was like whatever' but then he saw my Katie Couric and drove down here from Providence so I was likef that's romantic' right? Patrick forces a smile.
C: HELENE
D: Howrs your girlfriend?
E: CONT'D
N: PATRICK (HESITATES) She's all right. She's up the north shore with her sister. HELENE ( FLIRTY) If she donrt get smart' I'll take you out. (shakes her head) Hope she got better family than I do' right? Patrick forces a nod. She fastens an earring to her lobe.
C: PATRICK
D: Howfs Bea?
C: HELENE
D: I wouldn't let her in the apartment.
N: (JUSTIFYING) Whatr I want to lose her again? Forget it. (BEAT) She sold her unit. Moved out to fancy pants in Melrose. Good riddance.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah.
C: HELENE
D: Don' t think she didnft hate you for Lionel goinr to jail.
C: PATRICK
D: Probably why she never paid my bill.
C: HELENE
D: You should fuckin' sue.
N: Something registers on Amanda's face when Helene says "fuck.''
C: PATRICK
D: How about youf Helene? You hate me?
C: HELENE
D: Euck no. Brother or not he took my kid. Euck him. She could' a been hurt.
C: PATRICK
D: What about Amanda?
C: HELENE
D: What about Amanda?
C: PATRICK
D: Who's watching her?
C: HELENE
D: Dottie.
C: PATRICK
D: Dottie know that?
C: HELENE
D: She will in five minutes.
N: (GIGGLES) Shit, I'm gonna be late, too. Patrick waits.
C: HELENE
D: Unless you don't mind sittin' for her?
E: CONT'D
C: PATRICK
D: Sure.
C: HELENE
D: For real?
C: PATRICK
D: It's fine.
C: HELENE
D: She likes you.
N: Patrick looks to Amanda. She just sits there. Watches TV. HELENE (CONT'D) (LEAVING) You' re a godsend, Patrick. She goes. And then calls out from the stairwell. HELENE (O.S.) (CONT'D) BYE!! ! Patrick sits next to Amanda on the couch . . . And together -- silently -- they watch TV. Patrick sees that Amanda is holding her famous doll, the one the papers said she loved so much, the one Angie plucked from the quarry.. PATRICK (RE: DOLL) Is that Mirabelle? Amanda looks up at him. AMANDA (CORRECTING) Annabelle. He nods. It makes sense. They turn back to the television. PATRICK (V.0. ) I started going to Church again. I saw them bury Remy and, for the first time in years, maybe ever, I prayed for someone. I did everything I wanted to do. I proved my father wrong. I either learned my lesson or became a man, I can't tell the difference . Either way, all it' s left me is the hollow, copper aftertaste in my throat, like a vague and distant regret. Remy was right, I know very little--but what I do know, I am sure of: I was wrong about that commercial. "Shouldn' t your dog be treated like a member of the family?" It doesn't depend on the dog. It depends on the family. We hold on them for an extended beat. The blather from the television washes over them, the man and the little girl.
T: FADE TO BLACK
N: The End.
