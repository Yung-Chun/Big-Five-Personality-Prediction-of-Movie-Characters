T: FADE IN: (BEFORE TITLES)
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY
N: The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks; shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED: "1:52" Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual face is visible because of his thick white hair, large bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker -- "Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs, CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign: "SUBWAY."
S: INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY
N: A level above the locals, two above the express trains. Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens. Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice: "IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."
S: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY
N: Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the far end of the platform. SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA). MED. SHOT - FIFTH CAR From the platform, featuring the conductor (BUD CARMODY) as he leans out of his window surveying the station. He has a young, boyish face surrounded by long, curly red hair.
S: INT. FIFTH CAR
N: The door to the conductor's cab is open as Bud continues to lean out the window. Directly, behind him is MATSON, an older Conductor of retirement age who is busy instructing the younger man.
C: MATSON
D: C'mon, kid -- out loud so's I can hear what you're doin'.
C: BUD
D: I'm checking the passengers getting on and off -- front and back -- okay, it's all clear -- I'm shut- ting the doors; -.rear section
N: FIRST -- (pushes a button) -- then the front section -- (PUSHES ANOTHER) -- and -- the doors are closed. He pulls his head in and checks a row of lights on a panel.
C: BUD
D: Now I 'm checking the indicator box to make sure that the doors are all locked -- okay. The train starts with a jerk.
C: BUD
D: Igo back out the window --
N: (HE DOES) -- for a distance of three car- lengths to see that nobody's being dragged -- (RETURNING) -- I remove my door key -- and then the skate key -- and then I hit the transmitter button. (into a mike) Fifty-first Street' next stop -- the next stop is Fifty-first Street. (turning to Matson) How'd I do? CONTINUED
C: MATSON
D: How come you wanna be a conductor, anyway? Don't you know the con- ductor's sittin' in the goddam hotseat?
C: BUD
D: What do you mean, Mr. Matson?
C: MATSON
D: You're visible, for God's sake! Anything goes wrong -- anyone's got a gripe -- you're the one they see. Hell, in my twen'y-nine years o' stickin' my head out there I been slugged, spit on, hit by purses, fruit, rolled-up newspapers, baseball mitts -- an'.I been god- dam lucky! I never been puked on by a drunk like Charlie Boltzen was on the Parkchester line -- or stabbed in the neck like I heard one fella was on the Astoria BMT --
N: BUD (QUIETLY) Jesus.
C: MATSON
D: You take my advice, kid -- serve your six months an' then put in for Motorman. Watch it, we're cumin' in. Bud looks quickly off, sees the approaching station and hits his transmitter button.
N: BUD (ANNOUNCING) FIFTY-NINTH STREET
C: MATSON
D: No it ain't
N: BUD (CORRECTING) Fifty-first Street, sorry the station is Fifty-first Street.
C: MATSON
D: Never say you're sorry, kid -- somebody'll come back here an' bust your goddam nose.
N: CONTINUED - 2 Bud sticks his head out the window, remembers what Matson told him and pulls it partially back in. 51ST ST. STATION - BUD'S POV SHOOTING THROUGH the conductor's window as the train enters the station. We flash by the "rear-enders" (those I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses, slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc- tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away. PLATFORM - GREY RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down- track. He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark brown.
S: INT. FOURTH CAR
N: Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes.
S: INT. FIRST CAR
N: Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before them, playing.: at driving the train.
S: INT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB
N: Bud is removing his key and activating his mike. BUD (ANNOUNCING) Grand Central Station, next stop -- the next stop is Grand Central.
C: MATSON
D: Yeah -- if I was you I'd start studyin' for that motorman's exam right now.
N: CONTINUED
C: BUD
D: To tell you the.;truth, Mr. Matson, I have been. Want to hear some- thing?
N: (RECITING) Every car on the IRT is seventy-two feet long, cost $250,000 and weighs 75,000 pounds. It holds 44 seats with room for 136 standing.
C: MATSON
D: 'Cept at rush hour when you can push in another 20, at least. Honest to God, I. know personally of a case where this guy on a number 5 train dies of a heart attack at Union Square and he has t' wait until the Grand Concourse in the Bronx before enough people get off so's he can fall down.
N: (A PAUSE) Honest to God.
C: BUD
D: Mr. D'Agostino who rode with me last week said that happened on a double -A train on the West Side.
C: MATSON
D: Yeah? Who y' gonna believe? A wop or an American?
N: (LOOKING OUT) Here's where I'm gettin' off -- think you can get to Brooklyn Bridge all by yourself? BUD (GRINNING) Long as I don't have 'to drive --
C: MATSON
D: Stick with it, kid -- you're doin' great. See ya t'morrow. He crosses to the nearest door as the train decelerates. Bud activates. his mike and announces, waving to Matson as he does.
C: BUD
D: Grand Central Station -- change for the express. This is Grand Central.
N: CONTINUED - 2
C: IN
D: The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out, colliding with a very large man who is in a hurry to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white, bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen- long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves.
E: BROW^?PN
C: MATSON
D: What's your hurry, chief? We won't leave without you. Brown says nothing to Matson, does not look at him, does not even seem aware of their cohtact. Matson goes off into the crowd on the platform and Brown heads for the front of the car.
S: INT. FIRST CAR - GREEN
N: Still sitting, still facing the motorman's cab. The two boys continue to play at the front window. The doors can be heard slamming shut and the train jerks into motion. BUD'S VOICE (AMPLIFIED) Thirty-third Street -- next stop is Thirty-third Street . Suddenly Green's hand,clutches at his shirt collar, unbut- toning the top button and loosening his tie. He breathes a sigh of relief, ' then notices that his left leg is vibrat- ing. He quickly stills it by placing a hand on his knee.
S: INT. FOURTH CAR - GREY
N: Leaning back against the storm door. Now he picks up his valise, turns and.looks through the door, across the platform between the cars, into the fifth car, and catches sight of Brown who nods, almost imperceptively. Grey makes no sign of recognition at all. He turns and starts forward through the car, heading for the third car. At the far end a MAN is standing in front of the door, leaning down to talk to a seated GIRL. Grey stops and waits a moment. Finally:
C: GREY
D: Your ass. The man looks around and surveys Grey.
N: CONTINUED
C: NSFN
D: What about it?
C: GREY
D: Move it. The man glances at Grey for a moment, then moves it. Grey opens the door and steps out onto the platform between the two cars.
N: TWENTY-EIGHTH STREET PLATFORM CLOSE SHOT - STATION DESIGNATION The tile mosaics spelling out "28TH STREET." CAMERA now DOLLIES to a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of still another man with a white bushy mustache, white hair, dark glasses, slouch hat, gloves and raincoat -- BLUE. The time is SUPERIMPOSED: "2a 01. "
C: WIDER ANGLE
D: Blue stands at the downtown end of the platform, near the number 10 placard, carrying a bulging canvas valpac in one hazed and a trombone case in the other. A rumbling sound is heard, building, until a train roars through on the northbound express track, its lights flashing between the pillars. In a moment it is gone and the sound dies. Now a young black,.dressed in the latest extravagant PIMP's fashions -- flaring double-knit trousers, three- inch heels, wide-lapeled jacket and white, extra-wide- brimmed hat, swaggers, loose-jointed, to a spot near Blue and waits, cool and relaxed. He becomes aware of Blue observing him.

CAMERA ZOOMS IN on a sign on the side of the first car: "PELHAM BAY PARK" until only "PELHAM" fills the SCREEN. MED. SHOT - BLUE He hangs back until everyone has gotten on or off the train, then, without haste, carrying the valpac in one hand and the trombone in the other, he approaches the front of the first car. The Motorman (DENNY DOYLE), a middle-aged man with a ruddy face and wearing pin-striped overalls, is leaning far gut of his window, looking back along the platform. Blue puts down his bags, puts his right hand into his raincoat pocket and leans against the train with his left shoulder, blocking Doyle's view of the rest of the train.
C: DOYLE
D: Hey -- how do you expect me to -- ? He stops, suddenly aware that Blue has removed a very large army automatic from his raincoat pocket and has placed the muzzle against his head. Doyle jerks his head back, suddenly, banging it hard against the windowframe. Blue crooks his hand inside the window and now places the gun against the Motorman's cheek, directly under his right eye.

N: A long, unadorned room with a row of desks with phones, and a door marked "TOILET". Several TOWERMEN (and MRS. JENKINS, a black Towerwoman) sit at the desks before the flashing phone consoles, talking to dispatchers, trainmasters and other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however, i is the electronic Model Board, stretched high across one wall, recording in colored slashes of light the movements of every train that passes through the sector, all of it superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track routes and stations. One of the Towermen, MARINO, rushes over to Caz as he and the Plumber enter.

C: MARINO
D: It's been too long, Caz --

D: The New York City Subway System is the largest'in the world, with 237 miles of track and seven thousand cars that carry over a billion and a third passengers every year, making it also the busiest railroad in,the world.

Now the truck starts backing, and while there is still some space open it is closing fast. The cycles screech to a stop but it is clear that the truck doesn't intend to as it bumps up onto the sidewalk, and starts for the opening. But it is now too narrow. The screeching brakes of the truck are heard as it starts to skid around, the panorama flashing by sickeningly and, perhaps, a crash and, perhaps, the scene flopping over as the truck, perhaps, rolls over onto one side.

He notices his real gun in a holster at his belt and unbuttons the strap, freeing it. Then he assumes the stance of a gunfighter, hand poised over it, knees slightly bent. Then, moving suddenly, he slaps his holster, wheels, fires without aiming -- and there's a reverberating BANG, the shattering of glass and the figure in the subway car reels back. James looks at his hand in amazement -- there's no gun in it. Then, at the same-time, Brown has recovered his balance and begins firing his submachine gun, the bullets ricocheting off the metal pillars.

S: INT. CANAL ST. PLATFORM
N: as the single car roars through the station, the darkened front window divulges nothing.
S: INT. FIRST CAR
N: Some of the Passengers have gone to the front of the car. The W.A.S.P. is trying to open the door to the Motorman's cab, but there's no outside handle so all he can do is pound impotently against it. The Mother remains in her seat holding her two boys pressed against her. Now the Old Man starts pushing his way up front.
C: OLD MAN
D: My friends -- please -- the situa- tion isn't as lousy as it looks --

C: OLD MAN
D: No -- no we won't! I admit that right now we're on a run-away train, but it's only temporary -- The car careens into a curve and sways wildly as the metal wheels scrape and screech. There's a good deal of scream- ing and shouting from the Passengers as several fall down. The Old Man starts to topple but the Pimp steadies him.
C: OLD ILXN
D: Thank you, brother.

N: Propped up now against a pillar, straining to look at something, off. HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV Blue and Brown are tying the second money vest on Green, then help him on with his shirt 4nd coat. MED. SHOT - HIPPIE He returns his attention to the business of locating his gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now, lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in both hands and starts to take aim. HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV with the gun in the foreground, its sight being shifted as the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment, and when it clears, Green has already disappeared through the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires. Brown convulses and topples backwards.

S: INT. TUNNEL
N: Blue stands behind a pillar, his gun in hand, peering into the darkness, trying to locate the marksman. Green is in the well of the emergency exit, beside the metal ladder that leads up through a grate and out onto the street. Between them, before the open doorway to the well, Brown's body lies face up on the ground. Green now gestures for Blue to come across the open area separating then.
C: GREEN
D: Come on -- i
C: BLUE
D: I'd never make it -- I
N: (POINTING DOWNTRACK) It came from down there someplace -- I've got to. get him. Go on UP -- 1 Green hesitates, looks up the ladder, looks back at Blue.
C: GREEN
D: I -- I'll wait for you -- 1 Blue looks at him fora moment, then checks his pistol and, slowly, steps out from behind the pillar. A shot rings out immediately and the ricochet off the pillar zings loudly. Blue calmly fires twice at the muzzle flash.
N: MED. SHOT - HIPPIE Both shots have connected, one hitting his arm and sending the pistol flying away, the other into his upper chest, below the right shoulder. He topples over, sprawling across one rail, onto the roadbed. ICED, SHOT - BLUE He has stepped back behind his pillar again to listen. Silence. CONTINUED
C: GREEN
D: Did you hit, him -- ?!
C: BLUE
D: Quiet! He listens again, then leaves his pillar, and hurries downtrack to the next where he again waits and listens,

N: Now he can see the Hippie lying across the track ahead. He slowly starts toward him, calm, his pistol at his side.
C: BLUE
D: Mr. Green -- ! It's all right! Go on up -- I'll be right with you -- !
N: MED. SHOT - GREEN as he climbs up the ladder and starts pushing up the grating above his head.' MED. SHOT - HIPPIE Barely conscioous, unable to move, he watches Blue approach. MED. SHOT - BLUE as he continues walking, unhurried, toward the Hippie. Finally he arrives, stops, looks down at the injured man.
C: BLUE
D: You were on the train. Are you a cop? Almost imperceptibly, the Hippie nods -- just once.
C: BLUE
D: Then the Mayor will come to your funeral. X He lifts his gun to aim and fire and the Hippie manages to turn his head away. Then there's a shot -- and Blue crumples to the ground, dead.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE as Prescott comes up and stands looking down at Blue's body. Then he turns his attention to the Hippie, bending beside him. All he can see is the long blond hair.

C: OLD WOMAN
D: Know what's gonna go next? The Empire State Building.
N: PRESCOTT (SMILING) I wouldn't be surprised. He starts off down the street again, having folded back the front page and. now reading the third page. Suddenly he crumples the paper into a ,ball between his two hands, fakes dribbling it along the sidewalk, makes a good move, fakes one man, spins away from another and, hooking a high arching shot at a wire mesh trash basket, watches it hit the rim and bounce away, onto the pavement. PRES CO"'T (SOFTLY) Shit. He keeps on walking as the time is SUPERIMPOSED: "10:14."
