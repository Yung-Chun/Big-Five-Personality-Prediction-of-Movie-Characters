M: IN THE BEGINNING... 1
N: BLACK an infinite void but at the center a SINGULARITY, a particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains all the potential matter and energy in the universe.
C: THE BIG BANG
D: A blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes, particles expanding in all directions until they fill the screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust. Then the particles start to attract one another to form atoms, the atoms elements, the elements form molecules, the molecules compounds, the compounds cells, then a cell twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts booming out a Dolby heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms. Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and pull back to reveal--
N: THE SEA 2 Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore, brilliant sun rising in a cloudless azure sky. A WOMAN emerges from the sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit to obscure her nudity, but we can see she is full-breasted, long-limbed, toned and tanned-- perfection. Then a MAN rises up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the surf. Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect-- short, overweight. They turn to each other and embrace. It's paradise-- for him.
C: THE WOMAN
D: I'm so hungry.
E: looking deep in his eyes
C: THE MAN
D: Yeah. Me, too. The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to kiss her, but she turns and walks away.
E: wanting her
C: WOMAN
D: What should we eat?
C: THE MAN
D: Oh, you actually meant you were hungry. I thought-- forget it.
N: Official White 2. He follows her. They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach. When they reach the line of vegetation, the woman, MAYA, kneels, pulls berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth. The man, ZED, grabs a handful of berries and they squat there noshing like Adam and Eve.
C: THE WOMAN
D: Mmmm, these are so good.
C: THE MAN
D: Mmrrunm, they really are . When she turns away he spits them out in disgust. Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his, their lips almost touching.
C: MAYA
D: You know what I'd really like?
E: very sexy
N: ZED (HOPEFULLY) What?
C: MAYA
D: Some fruit.
C: ZED
D: (frustrated, but hanging
N: IN ) Yeah, fruit's good. (he stands up) You want an apple or a pear? MAYA (THINKS) No. He scans the nearby trees.
C: ZED
D: Orange? Tangerine? Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach? She shakes her head coyly. He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out various options. She follows him.
E: she shakes her head
N: Official White 3. ZED (cont'd) Plum? Nectarine? Passion fruit? MAYA (COQUETTISHLY) Nuh-uh.
C: ZED
D: Okay, don't tell me-- papaya? Pomegranate? Lemon? Lime? Kumquat? Uh, cock? Cockfruit?
E: fake smile
N: MAYA
C: NOOO--
D: The game is no longer cute but he still plays along.
C: ZED
D: Watermelon? Honeydew? Grapes?
N: MAYA NOOO--
C: ZED
D: Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo?
E: this is a lot of work to get laid
C: MAYA
D: Nope.
C: ZED
D: (he doesn't even like her
C: ANYMORE)
D: Okay, I give up. Which fruit do you want?
N: MAYA (POINTS) That one. Zed looks. It's a beautiful tree with lush, apple-like red fruit hanging from it. ZED (SCOFFS) Yeah, right. Okay.
C: MAYA
D: Why not?
N: Official white 4.
C: ZED
D: Because that's the fruit we don't eat! It's forbidden.
C: MAYA
D: Why not?
C: ZED
D: Because we don't! It's a rule! That's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. You don't eat from that one. Nobody ever has.
C: MAYA
D: Why not?
C: ZED
D: Stop saying why not! I told you-- it's a rule.
C: MAYA
D: So do you always follow the rules?
C: ZED
D: No-- yeah-- I don't know. We don't have that many rules. In fact, we only have one rule-- DON'T EAT THAT
N: FRUIT.
C: MAYA
D: Okay, fine. We won't. Forget I mentioned it. I understand if you're afraid--
C: ZED
D: I'm not "afraid"--
C: MAYA
D: No, really, it's all right. I just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks, crawls, swims, flies, or grows in the ground, but not that particular fruit. And I thought you might be the kind of man who's willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself, but I guess I was wrong. She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived and will ever live, he caves.
N: Official White 5.
C: ZED
D: Okay! Fine! You want to try the Good and Evil fruit, you got it. He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands her one. They both stare at the fruit.
C: MAYA
D: You first.
C: ZED
D: No way! It was your idea. You go first.
C: MAYA
D: We both bite at the same time. Zed considers for a long moment then decides.
C: ZED
D: Okay. Ready? One-- two-- three! Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him out and stops before her teeth break the skin. ZED Got me. That's a good move. I'm going to steal it. He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste of Good and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he spits it out. ZED Yuchh! That's horrible. Yecch, ptui! Ughh. He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out.
E: cont'd with his mouth full cont'd gagging and spitting
C: MAYA
D: So you're saying it's not good?
C: ZED
D: Yes! I'm saying it's not good! He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up. ZED Oh, no--
E: cont'd
N: Official White He runs for the bushes. Maya's attention gets diverted.
C: MAYA
D: Ooh, banana!
E: noticing something
T: CUT TO:
S: 3 EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
N: A TRIBE OF PRIMITIVE CAUCASIANS. Dozens of huts surround a mmunal fire pit where WOMEN in loincloths roll flatbread CO and cook it on heated rocks. The drums start pounding out a celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs in honor of the kill. The lead hunter MARLAK, is a hulking thug with a bony, Neanderthal forehead. He cuts off the boar's head and drops it at Maya's feet.
C: MARLAK
D: For you.
E: blunt grunt
C: MAYA
D: Thank you, Marlak.
E: forces a grateful smile
N: 4 ZED'S HUT Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut, his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next to him sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy, jealous of the attention they're getting from the women. If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear. He may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been invented he'd be wearing them. OH (GRUMBLING) Look at them. Hunters think they're so cool. They don't think gathering is dangerous? There are thorns-- bees-- those big stingy ants. I could hunt-- I just don't want to. And what's with the blood on their faces? They think that's sanitary? Official White 7.
C: ZED
D: Do me a favor. Just kill me.
E: miserable with pain
C: OH
D: Why did you eat that fruit? It's forbidden. Everybody knows that.
C: ZED
D: I couldn't help myself! Maya was just staring at me with those pouty eyes-- and those perky breasts-- opposable thumbs. And how about the name? "The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil"? You don't think that sounds tempting? They should've just called it "The Tree with the Fruit that Tastes Like Shit." Then for sure nobody would eat it. Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind his dwelling. ZED Hey! Squanto! Give me a break, would ya'! You got the whole forest! Why does everyone have to crap right behind my hut?
E: cont'd shouts testily to Oh
C: OH
D: I think, and I could be wrong, that all the poop makes the ground more fertile, which in turn, gives the leaves in the area a softer feel. It's a vicious circle. Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps. OH Hi, Eema! Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave, then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh that makes them laugh.
E: cont'd calls out eagerly
N: Official White 8. OH (cont'd) She doesn't even know I exist. (LOVE-STRUCK) I want to lay with her so badly.
C: ZED
D: I don't see it. I mean she's cute, but I don't think I'd lay with her.
C: OH
D: Of course not! She's your sister! It'd be like sleeping with your mother.
C: ZED
D: which was a big mistake. I see that now. You think it won't be awkward the next morning but-- trust me, you just want to rip your eyeballs out. Listen, if you want to impress Eema, tonight at the feast, do the fertility dance with her, then drag her back to your hut.
E: shakes off the memory
C: OH
D: My hut's a mess. And what if she struggles?
C: ZED
D: So you give her a little tap on the head. Women respond to that--
N: OH (SIGHS) No. She only likes hunters-- not gatherers. They look over at Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft of a hunter's spear.
C: ZED
D: I wouldn't read too much into that. She kisses, then tongues the spear tip. ZED Okay, that might mean something. The hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He's clearly half a rung lower on the human evolutionary scale.
E: cont'd
N: Official White 9.
C: MARLAK
D: You didn't hunt today.
C: ZED
D: Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I was indisposed. Got that intestinal thing that's been going around. Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the walls of Zed's hut.
C: MARLAK
D: What's that supposed to be?
E: points at a drawing
C: ZED
D: It's a bear.
C: MARLAK
D: That's not a bear. That's just some lines on a skin.
N: ZED (SIGHS) It's not a real bear. It's a "representation" of a bear. You know, a "picture."
C: MARLAK
D: That's stupid.
C: ZED
D: Yeah. Like you'd know.
C: MARLAK
D: And what's that? He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and holds it upside down.
C: ZED
D: That-- would be an antelope-- or a deer-- a deerpalope.
C: MARLAK
D: It looks like Maya.
E: trying to look at it upside down
N: Official White 10.
C: ZED
D: How could it be Maya? It's just some lines on a skin.
E: hides it away
C: MARLAK
D: Stay away from my woman.
C: ZED
D: Your woman? I'm not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual "thing" going. Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head.
C: MARLAK
D: Stay away.
E: walking off
C: ZED
D: Hey! Nice supra-orbital ridge, fartface!
E: calls after him
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: 5 A ROARING FIRE The DRUMS kick up another notch as the huge boar roasts on a spit over a roaring fire.
S: EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
N: The tribe is gathered around the big fire pit. The tribe's SHAMAN, their medicine man and spirit leader, dances around the fire in a boar's head mask, accessorized with way too many bones, beads and feathers. Zed and Oh are sitting near the fire, smoking something in a long, decorated pipe.
C: ZED
D: Hey, Oh? Did it ever occur to you that there may be more to life than this?
C: OH
D: Okay, I think somebody's had enough.
E: taking the pipe from Zed
N: Official White 11.
C: ZED
D: No, I'm serious.We're born into thisworld, we hunt, we gather, we eat,we sleep, we make babies--
C: OH
D: You make babies--
C: ZED
D: --but why? What's the point?
C: OH
D: You always get like this when you smoke. Oh takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing uncontrollably.
C: ZED
D: No. Last night I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there looking up at the sky, counting the stars. There were over seventy. Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?
C: OH
D: No.
E: looks up at the sky
C: ZED
D: Really? I've been thinking about it ever since I ate that fruit. Don't you ever wonder what's on the other side of the mountains?
C: OH
D: There's nothing on the other side of the mountains. Everybody knows that. The world just ends. You'd fall right off the edge.
E: makes a sharp gesture
C: ZED
D: But what if it doesn't? What if it just goes on and on forever? Or what if it's round? (he picks up a round
C: ROCK))
D: And if you keep walking you eventually come right back to where you started? He traces the circumference with his finger.
N: Official White 12. OH (SCOFFS) Oh, yeah, that's plausible. Zed flings the rock away.
C: A VILLAGER
D: Oww!
E: O.C.
C: ZED
D: Sorry!
E: waves apologetically
C: OH
D: (tries to cheer him up Will you stop with that crazy talk? We're at a feast. You love feasts. There's women, there's boar meat, there's an assortment of berries-- there's women-- Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks up on it.
C: ZED
D: Do it, man! Go dance for her.
C: OH
D: You think? They're playing the Jackal Dance. I don't do that one so well.
C: ZED
D: Are you kidding? Go! Jackal Dance! Oh summons his courage, gets up and crosses to where the girls are sitting. Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows and licks his lips. She laughs and looks away. Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema, subtly jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool. Eema just stares at him for a moment, then goes back to talking to her friends. Oh looks over at Zed for help. Zed mimes clonking her on the head. Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin. However, instead of submitting, she gets really pissed, stands up and decks him with one punch.
N: Official White 13. Eema glowers at Zed who feigns innocence.
T: CUT TO:
N: 6 THE FIRE PIT - MINUTES LATER A hunter is slicing off hunks of boar meat for the other tribesmen. Zed pushes through the small crowd waiting for food and goes to the front.
C: ZED
D: Excuse me, hunter coming through.
C: VILLAGERS
D: Hey! Wait your turn! There's a line here, buddy!
C: ZED
D: For your information I was in line and I just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady. Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort, ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.
C: MARLAK
D: Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the garden with Maya.
C: ZED
D: Oh, really? And what if I called Enmebaragesi a liar?
C: ENMEBARAGESI
D: I'd kill you.
C: ZED
D: Calm down. I said "what if"-- it was a hypothetical. Marlak gets right in Zed's face.
C: MARLAK
D: Enmebaragesi doesn't lie. Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them. Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat. MARLAK The truth!
E: cont'd
N: Official White 14.
C: MAYA
D: Zed, just admit it. You're just making it harder on yourself.
C: ZED
D: No, you just made it harder on myself! Okay, fine, you got me. (gingerly moves the spear
E: instantly annoyed to Marlak
C: POINT)
D: Maya and I lay together on occasion. We're consenting adults and we have an adventurous sexual relationship. Maya looks shocked, and tries to signal Zed to shut up.
N: MARLAK (STUNNED) You laid with my woman?
C: ZED
D: Isn't that what we're talking about? Maya rolls her eyes.
C: ENMEBARAGESI
D: No, I saw you eat the Forbidden Fruit.
C: ZED
D: Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the fruit. I was just kidding about humping Maya. Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops. Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed.
N: OH (FORCEFUL) Hey! What's going on? Marlak growls at him. OH (cont'd) (quickly looks up at the
C: SKY)
D: Oooh, shooting star.
N: Official White 15. Zed gets to his feet.
C: ZED
D: Look, Marlak, this is crazy. You're two of me. I'm not gonna fight you over a girl, okay? Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose. Zed And let that be a lesson to your big friend- Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid- section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends him sprawling to the ground.
E: cont'd to Enmebaragesi
C: MARLAK
D: Your father was a great hunter, but you're like-- a girl. The hunters laugh.
E: standing over Zed
C: ENMEBARAGESI
D: Good one, Marlak.
C: ANOTHER HUNTER
D: Zing.
C: MARLAK
D: Now I kill you. He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and jumps between them. The villagers step back as the Shaman howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed.
C: SHAMAN
D: We need to talk.
E: leaning close to Zed
T: CUT TO:
N: THE CAMPFIRE - MINUTES LATER Zed and the Shaman sit side by side on a log, talking privately. Official White 16. The Shaman is covered in skins, feathers, bones, beads, animal teeth, antlers and horns, his hair a mass of long, muddy dreadlocks, his face painted, his cheeks, nose, and ears pierced by shards of bone. But if not for his outlandish getup, zed could be talking to his pastor.
C: SHAMAN
D: You really ate the fruit?
C: ZED
D: One bite! What's the big deal?
C: SHAMAN
D: (halfheartedly shakes a chicken-foot rattle at
C: HIM)
D: You don't eat the fruit! That's been the number one rule from the beginning of time. Since the Great Turtle climbed from the sea with the Earth on his back, drank the ocean, pooped out the mountains and the first man fell from the stars.
C: ZED
D: I've always had trouble with the Great Turtle Theory-- too many unexplained gaps.
C: SHAMAN
D: Whatever. You're screwed now.
C: ZED
D: Really? How screwed? Like I knew it was a rule but I'm a little fuzzy on the exact details.
C: SHAMAN
D: You're cursed, man, and if you stay here then we'll all be cursed. You have to leave.
C: ZED
D: Where am I supposed to go?
C: SHAMAN
D: Up to you. From now on you're completely on your own.
N: ZED (DEFIANT) Oh, really? (MORE) Official White 17. ZED (cont'd) Am I detecting a little jealousy here because I now have the knowledge of good and evil and you don't? Well, you know what? I say what I did was a good thing-- a very very good thing-- and I'm not leaving. What do you think of that? A HUMAN SKULL comes flying in from off-camera and lands at his feet. ZED (cont'd) Okay, is that supposed to be funny? He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing around them in a wide circle. Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide shield, starting a rhythmical beat. The other hunters join in, keeping the beat, staring at Zed with lethal intent
C: SHAMAN
D: You should probably get going now. You better take this knife. He hands him a flint knife with a leather-wrapped handle. SHAMAN And some of the guys got together and they want you to have this bow. He hands him a strong hunter's bow.
E: to Zed, re the hunters cont'd
C: ZED
D: I don't want to seem ungrateful or anything, but you wouldn't happen to have any arrows, would you? An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head.
C: SHAMAN
D: You'd better get moving. Zed looks around at his fellow villagers, trying to summon what dignity he has left.
E: to Zed
N: ZED (DEFIANT) Okay, but before I go I just want to say something. I know I'm not the greatest hunter-- Official White 18.
C: VILLAGER
D: --Or gatherer--
E: O.S.
C: ZED
D: Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got to be more to life than this-- Kinda hard to concentrate with that rhythmic drumming, fellas. The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed. ZED Anyways, I'm going away, not because you're forcing me to-- which you are-- but because I choose to. Yes, I ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil-- major misunderstanding on my part-- and believe me I'm not recommending it unless you're interested in a very powerful laxative-- but it got me thinking about some pretty heavy stuff -- life questions, you know. So I'm out of here, and anyone who wants to join me is welcome. He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak staring at her and averts her eyes. ZED
E: to Hunters cont'd rolls his eyes; "these guys are hopeless" cont'd
C: ANYONE--
D: Zed looks at oh, who suddenly becomes very interested in an imaginary piece of loincloth lint. ZED I don't know where we're going or when we're going to get there, but I will lead the way-- (he picks up a burning
E: cont'd looks directly at Oh
C: TORCH)
D: lighting up the darkness-- pointing us in the right direction, and keeping us entertained with humorous anecdotes from my childhood. Now who's with me? He enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air.
N: Official White 19. Oh looks at Eema, then at Zed, and lowers his eyes. ZED (cont'd) Okay, then I guess I'll just have to go it alone, which is fine with
C: ME--
D: --better, in fact, because having a partner would just slow me down. Oh can't look at him. Zed shakes his head, failing to notice that the torch he's holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him. The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof. ZED Oops! They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof. ZED I know there's a lesson in here somewhere. Any thoughts? The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts. It's chaos.
E: to Oh cont'd cont'd
C: MARLAK
D: Now you die. Marlak throws his spear and misses as Zed takes off running into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the whole village ablaze.
E: raises his spear, to Zed
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
N: Zed runs for his life through the dense forest. The hunters chase him, shooting arrows at him on a dead run. Zed dodges as the arrows zip around him. He veers left, then right, then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment. The hunters stop at the top of the embankment. Marlak listens for sounds of movement in the forest below, then silently signals for the hunters to fan out. Official White 20. Marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment, reaches the bottom and sees something in the moonlight. It's Zed lying on the ground, badly camouflaged with sticks and leaves, thinking he can't be seen, but the shape of his body is clearly discernible. Marlak raises his spear.
C: MARLAK
D: I see you.
C: ZED
D: No, you don't.
E: long beat
C: MARLAK
D: Yes, I do.
C: ZED
D: How can you see me if I'm not here?
C: MARLAK
D: You're trying to trick me.
C: ZED
D: Okay, then tell me this-- who's standing right behind you?
C: MARLAK
D: You think I'm going to turn around and look, but I'm not. I'm going to gut you like a pig. He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is struck from behind by a heavy tree branch. He falls heavily, knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the makeshift club. Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh.
E: nobody's fool pulls his knife
C: OH
D: I guess I'm with you.
C: ZED
D: Was it my speech?
C: OH
D: No, the fire. I lost everything.
N: Official White 21.
C: ZED
D: But the speech was pretty good, right? I mean, even I was moved and I was the one speaking.
C: OH
D: Can we talk about this later? Oh pulls Zed to his feet, and they sneak off into the deep woods.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. A FOREST PATH - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: CRICKETS. Zed and Oh walk through the moonlit forest.
C: ZED
D: This is nice, out here, the two of us.
N: OH (SULLEN) Yeah, it's great.
C: ZED
D: Come on, those hunters are idiots. In an hour they'll forget the whole thing.
C: OH
D: I don't think they'll forget the fire.
C: ZED
D: You know what we should do? You and me should kill the biggest boar ever-- just huge!-- and take it back to the village. Just to show them. And we won't let anyone else eat it. They'll have to watch us eat it.
C: OH
D: If it's that huge how would we carry it back?
N: ZED (CONSIDERING) Fine, we'll just start with something small. A squirrel or something. Official White 22.
C: OH
D: Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel. Will you get real? There's no going back! There's, nothing to go back to! It's just ashes.
N: ZED (SCOFFS) Yeah, like it's so hard to build a new hut. It's just a pile of sticks and dung-- OH (SCOWLS) You're a pile of sticks and dung. Suddenly, Zed stops and stands perfectly still.
C: ZED
D: Oh!
E: through clenched teeth
C: OH
D: What are you doing? Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up. A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap. Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists.
C: ZED
D: Don't move a muscle.
C: OH
D: Will that work?
C: ZED
D: I don't know. There's two different opinions on this one. Some say run, some say don't.
E: without moving his lips
C: OH
D: What are you going to do?
C: ZED
D: I'm going to-- RUN! He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh.
T: CUT TO:
N: Official White 23.
S: EXT. A FIRE - DAYBREAK
N: Zed is holding a stick over the fire, cooking what looks like a squirrel or a muskrat. Oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks and branches. One of Oh's sticks falls, and as he carefully reaches down to grab it, the rest spill out on the ground. Oh sighs. His body is covered with long claw marks.
C: ZED
D: You really should put some maggots on those scratches. They look pretty deep.
N: OH (BITTER) I just want to know why you told me not to move, and you ran.
C: ZED
D: Because I honestly thought he'd go for me. I thought I was doing you a favor. Apparently not appreciated.
C: OH
D: Yeah, big favor.
C: ZED
D: You didn't have to come with me, you know. I didn't ask you to come.
C: OH
D: Yes, you did! You looked right at me-- twice.
C: ZED
D: Yes, that's a technique of public speaking, but I didn't ask you specifically. You chose to come. You gotta take some responsibility for that. And there's no point coming if you're just gonna keep whining about every little-- cougar that attacks you. You want some or not?
E: pulls the cooked rodent from the fire
N: Official White 24. OH (HUFFY) No, eat your weasel. You deserve it. He turns his back to Zed, and starts sorting through the pile of sticks.
C: ZED
D: You making your own fire?
C: OH
D: No, arrows. We're going to need them.
C: ZED
D: You're still coming?
E: perks up
N: OH (RESIGNED) Yes. Zed claps him on the back and hugs him exuberantly. Oh winces in pain.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY
N: Zed and Oh are hiking uphill, the lush, dense verdure of the forest now thinning to evergreens and mountain heather.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE MOUNTAINS - LATER Zed and Oh climbing higher now. Finally, they reach the top and look out at the vista. From their vantage point they can see a high plateau and wooded land stretching far beyond it. ZED (GLOATING) I knew it! Still think you're just gonna fall off the edge of the world? Official White 25.
C: OH
D: Incredible. He takes a step forward, the rock shelf gives way beneath his feet and he falls a great distance, screaming all the way down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders, then a long, tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom.
E: in amazement
N: ZED (WINCES) Oooh. - (then calls out) I'll go around! Wait for me!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOREST - LATER
N: Zed is following a trail downhill through the forest on the other side of the mountains. Oh is limping along behind him, bitten, clawed, cut, scraped and bruised.
C: ZED
D: Say what you want, but that was no accident. You don't see a pattern here?
C: OH
D: I see a pattern. Every time something terrible can happen to me, it does.
C: ZED
D: Yeah, but why? Why'd the cougar go for you and not me? Why did you fall and I didn't? Hard to believe it's all just random. Think about
C: IT--
D: J; avdganly MI , I ) ia htintI! f 1 inWROM m 11W, 10 looks around the forest clearing for subtle signs. ZED ia htintI! f 1 inWROM m 11W, 10 looks around the forest clearing for subtle signs. ZED People-- more than one-- walking-- that way.
E: cont'd cont'd sniffing the air he guesses
C: OH
D: You think? There's about a thousand footprints here.
E: looking around
N: Official White 26. He indicates the heavily trampled forest floor.
C: ZED
D: Yes! There! He drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes. Zed They stopped here to poop. Look.
E: ignores him cont'd
C: OH
D: No, thank you.
C: ZED
D: Four men, maybe five. And a child-- or a small women maybe.
C: OH
D: Okay.
E: a little disgusted
C: ZED
D: Looks like they had some nuts-- dried fruit-- some kind of green leafy vegetable--
E: poking at the evidence
C: OH
D: Okay! Enough! Can we just go? Maybe we can find where they peed. Then Zed sees light through the trees and creeps stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and they peer through the bushes. THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well- tended fields of growing grain. Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals Oh to be quiet and stay put.
N: ZED (WHISPERS) This one's mine. He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his quiver, and slowly draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows. He shoots. The blunt, pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and bounces off. The cow looks up. Official White 27. ZED (cont'd) (to Oh) We're gonna need some arrowheads. Zed draws his flint knife, then suddenly bursts out of the forest, dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back. Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying. Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED YOUNG FARMERS dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring at him.
C: FIRST YOUNG FARMER
D: Did you just shoot my cow?
C: ZED
D: (getting painfully to his
C: FEET)
D: Yeah, well-- we're hunters.
C: OH
D: He's a hunter. I'm more of a "maker." I made this loincloth, I do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for my hut--
E: covering for himself
C: ZED
D: What do you guys do?
C: SECOND YOUNG FARMER
D: What does it look like? We're farmers.
C: FIRST YOUNG FARMER
D: He's a farmer; I'm a herdsman.
C: SECOND YOUNG FARMER
D: You're a suck, is what you are.
C: FIRST YOUNG FARMER
D: My brother, Cain. I am called Abel.
E: ignores him
C: CAIN
D: You are called suck.
C: ABEL
D: My brother is angry because God looked on my sacrifice with favor.
N: Official White 28.
C: CAIN
D: "God looked on my sacrifice with
E: mimics him
C: FAVOR--"
D: Okay, is he a total suck or what?
E: to Oh
C: OH
D: Well, it's hard to say-- we just
N: MET--
C: ABEL
D: Why are you dragging them into this? What do they know? They're morons.
N: ZED (OFFENDED) Hey! Easy!
C: CAIN
D: You think you're so superior to everyone else.
E: to Abel
C: ABEL
D: Superior-er than you.
C: CAIN
D: Really? Let's see how good you are at getting your ass kicked.
E: shoves him
C: ABEL
D: Yeah? Bring it!
E: shoves him back
C: ZED
D: Okay, boys, that's enough. We just want to--
C: CAIN
D: No! This smug asshole insulted you and I want him to take it back.
E: won't let it go
C: ZED
D: We're not really that insulted--
C: CAIN
D: Take it back!
E: pushes Abel hard
N: Official White 29.
C: ABEL
D: Make me! Zed steps between them, trying to make peace.
E: pushes back
C: ZED
D: Boys, boys! You're brothers! Let's just relax and-- Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and wrestle each other to the ground.
C: OH
D: Shouldn't we do something?
C: ZED
D: Just let them settle it. Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing hard. ZED
E: cont'd
N: (SHOCKED) I guess that settles it.
C: CAIN
D: (turns on him sharply, still holding the bloody
C: ROCK)
D: What?!
C: ZED
D: Nothing! Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground.
C: CAIN
D: He's all right. Probably just
N: RESTING--
C: OH
D: Probably just tuckered out from the fight.
E: humoring him
C: CAIN
D: Yeah.
E: looking around nervously
N: (MORE) Official White 30. CAIN (cont'd) Maybe I should throw some dirt on him-- keep him warm 'til he wakes up. He starts kicking dirt over Abel's body. CAIN (cont'd) (getting worried) This is bad. This is really bad. We're in serious trouble.
C: ZED
D: Hey! What do you mean "we"? I don't want to play the blame game, but you're the one who hit him.
C: CAIN
D: You could've stopped me! There's two of you and only one of me.
E: turns on them
C: ZED
D: We didn't know you were going to kill him--
C: CAIN
D: You calling me a murderer?
E: he clutches the rock
C: ZED
D: Did I say that?
C: CAIN
D: It was an accident! Right?
E: to Oh
C: OH
D: Right! You were holding the rock and he-- accidentally ran into it-- really hard-- with his head.
C: CAIN
D: Okay-- yeah-- good. But it might be better if we don't mention the "accident" to anyone. People might get the wrong idea. Understand?
E: calming down
C: OH
D: Oh, yeah, people could so easily misinterpret that.
N: Official White 31. ZED (SHRUGS) Why even bring it up? CAIN (NODS) I like you guys. You're all right. Why don't you come with me? Have supper with the family.
C: ZED
D: Unfortunately we already have dinner plans.
C: CAIN
D: I think you should come with me.
C: OH
D: why don't we go with you?
E: his idea
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE FIELD - A LITTLE LATER
N: Cain finishes loading bushels of grain onto an oxcart while Zed and Oh closely inspect the big, heavy, solid wooden wheels on the cart.
C: ZED
D: What are the big round things for?
C: CAIN
D: They're wheels, numbskull. They make the cart roll.
C: ZED
D: Wow! That is like the greatest invention since the vagina. Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward. Oh screams as the HEAVY WHEELS ROLL OVER HIS FEET.
E: blown away
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON ZED AND OH They look really thrilled, wind blowing through their hair, their hands up like roller-coaster riders. Official White 32. ZED AND OH (WHOOPING) Woooo! Woooo! Yeah! PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
C: THE CART
D: with them riding on it, plodding slowly into a FARMING HAMLET,Â°a cluster of small, roughly plastered mud houses with thatched roofs. ADAM, dour, hard-working and long-suffering, but still strong and upright, trudges home with a metal scythe over his shoulder. He could be Max Von Sydow.
C: ADAM
D: Cain, my son!
E: hailing Cain
C: CAIN
D: Hail, Father. Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh. CAIN Can these guys stay for supper? (off Adam's questioning
E: cont'd
C: LOOK)
D: I bring strangers who would sojourn with us this night. Cain turns to Zed and Oh and furtively mimes an elaborate lip- sewing gesture, ancient precursor to the modern lip-zipper.
C: ADAM
D: Greetings, strangers. I am called Adam and you are welcome to share the fruits of our toil.
C: ZED
D: Thanks, but I'm kind of staying away from fruit for the time being. Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them into his crude dwelling.
N: Official White
S: 17 INT. ADAM'S DWELLING - NIGHTFALL
N: The rude dwelling has a stark, somber, almost Amish feeling to it. Zed and Oh sit at the table sharing a simple meal youngest with Adam, Cain and his Adam's wife EVE and h them, Lilith's tunic gaping open to reveal her breasts every time she leans over to put something on the table. Zed and Oh can't take their eyes off her.
C: ADAM
D: Where is thy brother, Abel?
E: to Cain
C: CAIN
D: Abel? Haven't seen him. I thought he was with you. You guys see him? They shake their heads and cough nervously.
E: badly overplaying to Zed and Oh
C: ZED AND OH
D: Nape. Not that I remember. Never seen anybody-- anywhere-- anytime -- ever.
E: equally unconvincing
C: ADAM
D: Your sister Lilith said she saw him in the field with you.
E: to Cain
C: CAIN
D: I think that was yesterday.
C: ADAM
D: No, this day. She said you both made offerings.
C: CAIN
D: That might've been Boaz---
C: ADAM
D: No, you and Abel. She said it looked like you were arguing.
C: CAIN
D: Hey, we're brothers, we argue sometimes- it's not that big a deal.
N: Official White 34.
C: ADAM
D: And his flock was untended in the
N: PASTURE-- CAIN (EXPLODES) Okay! What am I-- his keeper? Get off my back, will you? He smashes his plate against the wall and storms out. An awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks.
C: ADAM
D: I fear the worst for Abel. I am sorely vexed.
C: ZED
D: Yeah, that's got to be pretty vexing. A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly on his sorry circumstances.
C: ADAM
D: For my sin the ground is cursed. Thorns and thistles does it sprout for us, and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives. For as the Lord has commanded, by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust shall you return.
C: ZED
D: Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't it?
C: ADAM
D: It's the way of the world.
C: ZED
D: Boy, I hope not.
C: ADAM
D: You are welcome to stay the night and lay with my daughter Lilith. Zed looks at the luscious Lilith, then back at Adam.
E: rises abruptly
N: Official White 35.
C: ZED
D: I'm waiting for the punchline.
C: ADAM
D: She is without a husband, and as the Lord has said, thou shalt be fruitful and multiply. Lilith nods demurely and exits through a curtain. Zed starts to follow her out.
C: OH
D: Hey! What about me?
C: ADAM
D: You may share the bed of my son Seth.
C: ZED
D: Yeah, there you go. Oh looks at Seth.
E: he exits
C: SETH
D: I multiplied with a sheep. My thingie smells like lamb chops.
E: Oh just stares at him
S: INT. LILITH'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Zed enters the room. Lilith reclines on a cot with a straw mattress.
C: LILITH
D: My bed is small but you're welcome to share it. It's the way of my people.
E: making room on the cot
C: ZED
D: And that's a good way to be. In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway. I would've thought guys would be lined up at the door.
E: lying down beside her
C: LILITH
D: I don't like men.
N: Official White 36.
C: ZED
D: Maybe you just haven't met the right one.
E: moving closer
C: LILITH
D: I like girls.
N: ZED (SUAVE) So we have that in common--
C: LILITH
D: I'm attracted to women.
E: stares at him for a beat
C: ZED
D: I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
E: a beat
C: LILITH
D: I like to have sex with other women.
C: ZED
D: (stares at her for a long
C: MOMENT)
D: I'm really not getting this. Lilith shakes her head, turns away from him, and pulls up her blanket. Zed shrugs and rolls over to sleep. They lie there quietly in the dark for a long beat. Then-- Zed You're kidding! Whoa! That's amazing!
E: cont'd
S: INT. SETH'S ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Oh is lying next to Seth, wide-awake, trying to stay as far away from him as possible.
C: SETH
D: Oooh, listen to this one. Seth lifts his knees to his chest and farts a surprisingly long cadenza.
C: OH
D: That's really good.
N: Official White 37.
C: SETH
D: Want to see a trick?
C: OH
D: Do I have to?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ADAM'S DWELLING - DAYBREAK
N: In the yard behind the house, Oh is helping Cain as he chops firewood with a metal axe. Oh now wears a tunic like the farmers.
C: CAIN
D: It's been the same damn thing my whole life. "Why can't you be more like Abel?" "Oh, your sacrifice was good, too, but Abel's was-- wow!"
E: swings the axe-- thwack! thwack! thwack!
C: OH
D: (trying to change the
C: SUBJECT)
D: Your brother Seth is an interesting guy. Did you know he can put his penis in his mouth? Adam and Zed come out of his dwelling. KINSMEN from other dwellings start gathering.
C: ADAM
D: Cain!
C: CAIN
D: Yeah, hey-- where's everybody going?
C: ADAM
D: To look for Abel.
N: CAIN (MUTTERS) Good luck.
C: ADAM
D: What did you say?
N: Official White 38.
C: CAIN
D: I said good luck. I'm really worried about him. He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's benefit.
E: louder, mock sincerity
C: ADAM
D: You're not coming?
C: CAIN
D: Yeah, I am. I just have to finish toiling over here, then I'm right behind you. Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart. CAIN Now listen, I'm getting out of here, and you better come with me. I have a feeling they're going to try and blame this whole "Abel- killing-thing" on you.
E: cont'd to Zed and Oh
C: ZED
D: Why would they blame us?
C: CAIN
D: Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in, they're going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are drifters, so they'll put two and two together and that makes-- He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh. CAIN Four! It makes four! Now stop asking so many questions and hop on. We gotta get out of here! He urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward.
E: cont'd
T: CUT TO:
N: Official White 39.
S: 21 EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MINUTES LATER
N: Adam and the other farmers discover Abel's body. ADAM (BITTERLY)
C: CAIN--
D: After him! The farmers shout and race back to the hamlet.
E: to the others
T: CUT TO:
S: 22 EXT. THE HAMLET - MINUTES LATER
N: Adam and the other farmers jump onto two more oxcarts and set out after Cain, Zed and Oh.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CART PATH - LATER
N: Cain's cart lumbers along. He looks back over his shoulder.
C: CAIN
D: They're gaining on us! Zed and Oh look back.
E: urgently, to Zed and Oh
C: THEIR POV
D: The other oxcarts are a hundred yards back, "chasing" them at maybe two miles per hour. Cain whips his oxen and they step up the pace to 3 MPH.
N: CAIN (GLEEFUL) Hah! They'll never catch us now! An aerial view shows Cain's cart slowly pulling away from his pursuers. Suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and strikes Cain right on the forehead, knocking him back into the cart. He sits up stunned, with a still-smoking, jagged burn mark on his forehead. Official White 40. CAIN (cont'd) (dazed but exhilarated) Wow! What are the odds of that?! (feeling the burn mark) Am I lucky or what? Zed and Oh exchange doubtful looks and glance nervously at the sky.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE SEASHORE - DAY
N: The ox cart approaches a small trading settlement on the seacoast, a kind of makeshift tent city around a central marketplace. Several dhows are tied up at the shore, camels and pack animals are tethered on the fringes, while TRADERS and MERCHANTS inspect newly arrived goods and haggle over prices.
S: EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY - LATER
N: Zed, Oh and Cain wander through the crowded market. PEOPLE OF EVERY RACE dressed in all manner of exotic garb buy, sell, and barter goods from distant lands. Zed and oh gawk like a couple of yokels.
C: ZED
D: Look at all these people! And this stuff! Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread.
C: OH
D: Can I have one of those? He reaches for a loaf but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with a cane. OH Ow!
E: to the Merchant cont'd
C: MERCHANT
D: Two silver pieces.
N: CAIN (HUNGRY) We're gonna need some money. Official White 41.
C: ZED
D: Yeah, we're gonna need money. What's money? They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around a raised platform. SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned. The AUCTIONEER brings up a fnuscular male slave in a loincloth. ZED It's Marlak! Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain attached to a thick leather collar around his neck.
E: an afterthought cont'd
C: AUCTIONEER
D: Next up, an unusual item-- looks like a Caucasian-- he's big, he's strong, he's a good breeder, so I'm going to start at 100 gold minas. Do I hear 100? As the bidding starts, Zed spots Maya, his sister Eema, and Enmebaragesi among the chained-up slaves waiting to be sold. Zed and Oh push their way through the crowd and go to them.
E: addresses the crowd
C: ZED
D: Eema! Maya! The women embrace him with relief and excitement.
E: amazed to see them
N: OH (SHEEPISH) Hi, Eema.
C: EEMA
D: Oh.
C: ZED
D: What happened? How did you get here?
N: Official white 42.
C: MAYA
D: Well, after the fire-- ) --the hill tribes raided the village. The men fought them but they were too many. They took us captive, marched us to the sea, then traded us to the boat people who brought us here.
E: she shoots him an accusing look
C: OH
D: Are you all right? Did they-- rape you?
E: to Eema
N: EEMA (SHRUGS) Just a little. Zed and Oh look at her curiously. The SLAVE TRADER sees them talking to Eema and approaches.
C: SLAVE TRADER
D: You interested in some slaves?
C: ZED
D: Yeah, this one looks pretty good-- He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's breasts. She punches him. Zed Ooh, feisty! So how does this work if we want them? The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes.
E: like a prospective buyer cont'd
C: SLAVE TRADER
D: You have money?
N: ZED (CAGEY) Well, that depends on what you mean by money?
C: SLAVE TRADER
D: Look, pal, money talks and bullshit walks. I don't have time for looky- loos.
N: Official white 43. Cain steps up and intercedes. CAIN (GRANDLY) Perhaps I can help. (confidentially to Zed and
C: OH)
D: Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I can make a deal with him. You guys wait here. Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and walks him away. CAIN So what are we lookin' at here? From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't hear what they're saying.
E: cont'd to the slave trader
C: OH
D: What an amazing coincidence-- running into you and Maya and them.
E: to Eema
C: ZED
D: You still think it's all just a coincidence? All of us here right now, at this particular place, at this particular time?
N: OH (THINKS) I don't know. Why do you think?
C: ZED
D: I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting to believe that everything happens for a reason. Like, why did I eat the forbidden fruit?
C: OH
D: To get laid?
C: MAYA
D: Hey!
N: ZED Official White 44. Okay, that might have been what I was thinking at the time, but what if some omnipotent force put the fruit there because I was supposed to eat it?
C: OH
D: which omnipotent force?
C: ZED
D: What do you mean "which" omnipotent force? How many omnipotent forces could there be?
C: OH
D: I don't know! What's "omnipotent" mean?
C: ZED
D: Work with me-- I'm just speculating here. Let's call this force "God"; and let's say this "God" is controlling everything. Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil.
C: OH
D: Why would he want that?
C: MAYA
D: How do you know God's a "He?" Zed rolls his eyes.
C: ZED
D: Don't you get what I'm saying? What if we've been chosen?
C: MAYA
D: You think we've been chosen by God?
C: ZED
D: Well, no offense, but it's possible that I was chosen and you all just happened to be there.
C: OH
D: Why would God choose you? Why wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's stronger.
N: Official White 45.
C: ZED
D: A chosen doesn't need to be strong. I'm big this way.
E: points to his temples
C: OH
D: You do have a fat face.
C: ZED
D: Not my face, my brain. It's enormous. I'm the smartest guy in the village.
N: OH (SCOFFS) You're not even-- I'm smarter than you!
C: ZED
D: What?! Which one of us is smarter?
E: to ANOTHER VILLAGER
C: VILLAGER
D: You're both idiots!
C: ZED
D: Oh yeah, then why are we free and you're chained up?
C: VILLAGER
D: Because of you?
C: CAIN
D: Hey! Come here. I think we worked something out.
E: calls them over
C: ZED
D: Sit tight. I'm going to get you out of here. Do you trust me?
E: confidently, to Maya
N: MAYA (HEDGING) I want to trust you.
C: ZED
D: Fair enough. She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to Cain and the slave trader.
N: Official White 46. ZED (cont'd) (to Cain) Good work. What's the deal? The slave owner smiles.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SLAVE MARKET - A LITTLE LATER
N: Zed and Oh are dragged onto the platform in shackles and leg irons. They see Cain riding off on a donkey. He holds up a bag of coins and waves goodbye.
C: ZED
D: I never trusted that guy.
N: OH (SARCASTIC ) Why? Just 'cause he murdered his brother and got hit by lightning? They are pushed to the front of the platform.
C: SLAVE TRADER
D: All right! Next up is a twofer-- I'm selling them as a pair-- I know they don't look like much-- but I'm starting the bidding at sixty gold minas. Do I hear sixty?
E: to the crowd
N: (NOTHING) Remember, it's two for one here. Do I hear fifty? Anyone? That's only twenty-five apiece, folks. (NOTHING) Zed looks out at the crowd, starting to get offended. SLAVE TRADER (cont'd) You're breaking my heart here. How about forty? Do I hear forty? (NOTHING)
C: ZED
D: It's not like I want to be a slave or anything, but this is embarrassing!
E: to Oh
N: Official white 47.
C: SLAVE TRADER
D: Thirty-five? Thirty?
N: ZED (SHOUTS) Come on, people! We're a steal at thirty!
C: OH
D: They probably don't know how smart you think you are. Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk and waves it at the slave trader.
C: SLAVE TRADER
D: Yes! Sold to Sheikh Hassan for 30 gold minas! Have a good time in the salt mines, boys.
E: to Zed and Oh
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT - LATER THAT DAY
N: A small CARAVAN OF CAMELS AND DONKEYS loaded with trade goods moves across the arid wasteland. The effete SHEIKH rides the lead camel, protected from the blistering sun by a colorful canopy. A FEW ARMED BEDOUIN GUARDS ride alongside. Bringing up the rear is A LARGE FOUR-WHEELED CART DRAWN BY HORSES, basically a cage on wheels into which TWENTY NEWLY PURCHASED SLAVES have been crammed, jammed together like sardines. Zed and Oh are in the middle of the body pile, literally cheek by jowl with the other slaves, barely able to move. I Eema is right next to Oh, her body pressed tight against his. Oh shifts around, repositioning his arms and body trying to get more comfortable and give Eema a little space, but he just ends up touching her even more. OH (EMBARRASSED) Excuse me-- I'm sorry-- (his hand gets stuck between her breasts) That's not good-- He jerks his hand away, elbowing Marlak in the face. Official White 48. Marlak growls and grabs Oh by the throat, but the struggle forces everyone else to shift which causes even more discomfort.
C: THE OTHER SLAVES
D: Ow! Hey! Cut that out! Zed tries to turn his head to see who's behind him.
N: ZED (CONT'D) (GROUCHY) Hey, pal! You can take your foot out of my ass anytime now. (BEAT) And your foot is still there. If I turn around, you will be sorry. Zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya. ZED (cont'd) That's better.
C: MAYA
D: For you maybe.
C: ZED
D: Look, I want you to know I blame myself for everything that happened.
C: MAYA
D: So does everybody else.
C: MARLAK
D: Get away from my woman!
E: over his shoulder
N: ZED (IRRITATED) I don't think that's going to be possible. And I told you before, she's not "your woman."
C: MARLAK
D: I'll kill you! Marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body pile trying to get to Zed.
C: THE OTHER SLAVES
D: Hey! Watch it, jerk!
N: Official White 49. It's too cramped to even throw a punch, so Marlak uses a RANDOM SLAVE'S HEAD as a weapon to bang against zed's head repeatedly. RANDOM SLAVE (MEEKLY) Why? Suddenly Zed feels Marlak's hands around his neck, grabbing him from behind. Zed struggles but Marlak manages to pull him into a full headlock, forcing Zed's face into his hairy armpit. ZED (MUFFLED) Ecchhh! Oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but can't move.
C: OH
D: Hold on! I'm coming! Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch. OH If everyone could just move to the right. Please? Thank you in advance for your cooperation. You can do it, Zed! Use his weight against him! Marlak now has Zed locked in a lethal choke hold.

N: A BEDOUIN GUARD notices the commotion and bangs the bars of the cage with his staff.
C: BEDOUIN
D: Knock it off! Don't make me come in there!
E: shouts at the slaves
N: ZED (MASHED) I'd like to see you try. The Bedouin is just about to respond when suddenly A METAL TIPPED ARROW FLIES IN AND PIERCES HIS THROAT. He drops to the sand, dead. Official White 50.
C: A BATTLE CHARIOT
D: comes flying over the crest of the wadi followed by TWENTY ARMORED FOOT SOLDIERS wearing bronze helmets and breastplates. The soldiers attack the caravan, slashing and slicing the Bedouin guards. Their commander, SARGON, his helmet topped with a magnificent plume, rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of his sword cuts the head off ANOTHER BEDOUIN GUARD. Marlak reaches through the bars, grabs the fallen Bedouin's sword and hacks off the lock on the door of the slave wagon. The door flies open and the slaves tumble, jump and stumble out onto the ground. Zed and Oh look around, gawking at the massacre taking place. Then Zed sees Marlak, sword in hand, looking for him.
C: SARGON
D: Take the slaves! Marlak starts for Zed but two soldiers ride up and throw a heavy restraining net over him. Zed grabs oh and takes off running over the nearest sand dune. Sargon watches them flee.
E: shouts an order
C: A SOLDIER
D: Sir, shall I pursue them?
C: SARGON
D: No. Let the desert have them. They won't get far.

C: SARGON
D: Tend to the slaves. We leave for Sodom before daybreak.
C: GUARD
D: Yes, sir.
N: 30 ZED AND OH They lie hidden behind a sandy ridge watching from a short distance. ZED (WHISPERS) I wonder who they are. Their hats are really great, aren't they?
C: OH
D: Their hats? I'm sorry, but when that one guy cut the other guy's head off, my first thought wasn't, "Gee, what a great hat."
C: ZED
D: It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't up there.
N: (WATCHFUL) Now we just need to figure out a way to rescue Maya and Eema.
C: OH
D: How are we going to rescue anybody? They're killers!
N: ZED (WILY) Patience, my friend. Even killers have to sleep sometime. He keeps a sharp, wakeful eye on the enemy camp.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: THE MORNING SUN
D: Zed and Oh fast asleep on the ridge. They slowly wake up.
N: Official White 52. ZED (SCRATCHING) Well, that was refreshing. How'd you sleep? OH (YAWNS) Not that well. I think I was over- tired. Then Zed suddenly remembers Maya. He looks and sees that the soldiers and slaves are long gone.
C: ZED
D: Shit! He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction.
C: OH
D: Now where do we go? Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes the sand.
C: ZED
D: I have no idea.
T: CUT TO:
C: ZED AND OH
D: trudging across the desert in the blistering heat, growing weaker, stumbling and falling.
C: OH
D: Why do I listen to you? Now we're going to starve to death or die of thirst.
E: too weak to move
C: ZED
D: Will you stop being so negative? I got your back, man. Who saved you from those lions when you were a baby? They were going to pounce, had you surrounded. Took the mama lion-- BAM!-- kneed her right in the face. Papa lion comes flying at me-- BAM!-- dropped an elbow, knocked his ass out.
N: (MORE) Official White 53. ZED (cont'd) Took his legs-- THWOOM!-- tossed him in the river. And the rest just ran off.
C: OH
D: You know, I've asked people about that and no one else seems to remember it.
C: ZED
D: Yeah, because nobody else was there. You're lucky I was walking by.
N: (THEN) Okay, it's possible I dreamed that-- but who practically raised you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons? Not a dignified death.
C: OH
D: He was a small man. Oh collapses face down in the sand. Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry jackals, vultures and hyenas.
E: practically delirious
C: ZED
D: We've got to keep moving. I've got you, buddy-- just like always. He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on.
E: hauls Oh to his feet
S: EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - LATER
N: A MAN in his sixties, tall, full beard, piercing eyes and fierce nose, dressed in a robe and kafiyya, arranges firewood on a large flat rock. His TEENAGE SON looks around curiously. They are ABRAHAM and ISAAC.
C: ISAAC
D: Hey, Dad? We making a burnt offering?
C: ABRAHAM
D: Yes, Isaac. As God has commanded me.
N: Official White 54. ISAAC (CONFUSED) I don't see the sheep.
C: ABRAHAM
D: The Lord will provide the sheep. Abraham takes a cord and starts tying Isaac's hands together.
N: ISAAC (NERVOUSLY) Uh-- is this like a magic trick? Without another word Abraham takes strong hold of Isaac and lifts him up onto the firewood. ISAAC (cont'd) (really scared now) Okay, if this is because I didn't clean up my tent, you can stop now. I get it. Then Abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his robe. ISAAC (cont'd) (PANICKED) All right, this isn't funny anymore! Abraham raises the knife. ISAAC (cont'd) I'm telling mom! The knife flashes in the sun as it descends toward the boy. ZED (O.C.)
C: STOP!
D: Abraham and Isaac both turn to see Zed and Oh step out from behind the rocks. Their clothes are tattered and they are burnt raw by the sun. ZED What are you doing to that kid?
E: cont'd
N: ABRAHAM (INNOCENTLY) Nothing. Official White 55.
C: ZED
D: What do you mean, nothing? You were just going to kill him!
C: ABRAHAM
D: No, I was going to sacrifice him. There's a difference.
C: ZED
D: Not to him, I'm guessing. Isaac nods gratefully.
E: indicating Isaac
C: ABRAHAM
D: By what right do you interfere? Art thou an angel of the Lord?
C: ZED
D: What do you think?
E: good question
C: ABRAHAM
D: Verily, thou wast sent to stay my hand by the Eternal one, blessed be He.
E: nods sagely
N: ZED (NODS) Whatever you just said. Oh helps Isaac off the altar stone and unties him.
C: ISAAC
D: He's nuts! I'm telling you-- he's totally lost it.
E: confidentially to Oh
C: ABRAHAM
D: I am Abraham, son of Terah of the house of Nahor.

S: EXT. HEBREW ENCAMPMENT
N: Abraham leads Isaac, Zed and Oh past the colorful tents of his people. The camp is alive with activity.
S: INT. ABRAHAM'S TENT - NIGHT
N: The spacious tent is lit by torches, and a feast is in progress. TWENTY OR THIRTY BEARDED MEN in skullcaps and long robes lounge on cushions or sit cross-legged in a circle on the carpeted floor. An EGYPTIAN BELLY DANCER shakes her hips for the pleasure of Abraham who occupies the place of honor. Zed and oh, now also wearing robes and skullcaps, are sitting right beside him eating and drinking everything in sight. Isaac sits beside them. ABRAHAM claps his hands for attention. Zed and Oh look up as the music stops.
C: ABRAHAM
D: My brothers, let us give thanks unto God for staying my hand on the mountain this day.
E: to the assembly
C: ISAAC
D: Best dad in all the land, everyone!

E: in unison
C: ZED AND OH
D: --mumble mumble mumble loving kindness. Abraham looks at them.
E: a beat late
C: ABRAHAM
D: Friends, whence comest thou? Zed and Oh look at each other blankly.
N: ISAAC (HELPFULLY) He wants to know where you're from. ABRAHAM (SUSPICIOUS) Thou comest not from the cities of the plain? From Sodom or Gomorrah? Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others.
C: ZED
D: Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been there. But I've heard of them.
C: OH
D: Are they nice?
C: ABRAHAM
D: The Lord has cursed them for their abomination.
C: ZED
D: i didn't know that. What kind of abomination are we talking about?
E: nods gravely
C: ABRAHAM
D: They bow down before false Gods and worship graven images.
N: Official White 58.
C: ZED
D: Abominable.
E: clicks his tongue
C: ABRAHAM
D: The men of the city are weak and soft, fat with rich food, intoxicated by strong drink.
C: ZED
D: Really. Tell me more.
E: sounds good to him
C: ABRAHAM
D: Their women are whores; their shameless lust knows no bounds. They flaunt their flesh without shame and any man may have knowledge of them.
C: OH
D: And where exactly are those cities?
E: he's sold
C: ZED
D: We just want to know so we can avoid them.
E: off Abraham's stern look
N: ABRAHAM (FIERCELY) Walk not the path of Sodom! For surely will the Lord send his holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within, to smite them and all their seed for their iniquity. ZED (CONCERNED) When do you think all this smiting is going to go down? We may have some friends there.
C: ABRAHAM
D: Accompany me. Abraham sweeps out of the tent. Zed and Oh jump to their feet and follow. Isaac tags along.
E: getting up
N: Official white 59.
S: EXT. THE TENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Abraham walks to the edge of the desert. Torchlight from the camp flickers on his face as he gazes across the desolate moonlit landscape.
C: ZED
D: Abraham, I'm a little worried about the city being destroyed.
C: ABRAHAM
D: Their fate is sealed. But for my faith and devotion, the self-same God has given unto me the whole of this land, from the Jordan to the Negev, from the river of Egypt to the great Euphrates. This did He grant to me and my seed. He raises his arms and spreads them wide.
N: ZED (IMPRESSED) This is all your land?
C: ABRAHAM
D: For eternity.
N: ISAAC (SCOFFS) Yeah, God just forgot to tell anyone else. we're having a war with someone like every five minutes.
C: ABRAHAM
D: I and my kinsmen have vanquished our enemies by the mighty hand of the Lord, praised be He. Zed and Oh fake their way through a ritual response.
E: scowls at him
C: ZED
D: His name is praise and love his whole graciousness--
C: OH
D: --of his wealthy bounty. Abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes.
N: Official White 60.
C: ABRAHAM
D: Therefore, to signify my Covenant with the One True God, on this night will I circumcise the flesh of my foreskin, and of you and every male who dwells hereby.
C: ZED OH
D: Excuse me? I'm not clear--
C: ISAAC
D: Here we go again--
C: ABRAHAM
D: we will grasp the foreskins of our penises and cut therefrom the extra flesh.
N: ZED (AGHAST) I'm not sure I have any extra.
C: OH
D: Couldn't we could just get our ears pierced?
C: ISAAC
D: Okay, what did I tell you-- nuts?
E: aside to Zed
C: ZED
D: You know, Abe, it's late, and we've all had a lot to drink, and I know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good idea now, but you may just want to sleep on it. we could always cut 'em off in the morning, but if we do it now, there's just no putting it back on later.
C: ABRAHAM
D: No. So it shall be written, so it shall be done. Get my big knife. Zed and Oh both reflexively cover their crotches.
E: to Isaac
T: CUT TO:
N: Official white 61.
S: EXT. THE DESERT - NIGHT
N: Zed and oh stumble over the rocky hills. They hear a PAINED SCREAM from someone being circumcised back at Abraham's camp.
C: OH
D: You have any idea where we're going?
C: ZED
D: To the city. I have to find Maya.
C: OH
D: The city! He said God's going to smite them with holy fire!
C: ZED
D: And you're going to listen to him? You think he's more chosen than me?
C: OH
D: He seemed to know what he was talking about.
C: ZED
D: Yes, and he also wanted to give his dick a little trim.
C: VOICE
D: Hey, wait up! Zed and Oh turn to see Isaac running towards them.
E: O.C.
C: ISAAC
D: I'm coming with you.
E: out of breath
C: ZED
D: You don't even know where we're going.
C: ISAAC
D: You're going to Sodom, right?
C: ZED
D: No. Your dad specifically said Sodom and Gomorrah were evil.
C: ISAAC
D: Yeah, whatever. If I show you how to get there, will you buy me a bottle of wine?
N: Official White 62.
C: ZED
D: No! I told you, that's not where we're going.
C: ISAAC
D: Fine. Then we'll just stand here.
C: ZED
D: Fine. They stand there for less than a beat. ZED Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom. Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance.
E: cont'd
C: THEIR POV
D: Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent city of Sodom set atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls.
C: ZED
D: I knew it was right around here.
C: ISAAC
D: Me and my friends sneak in on the weekends. We hang around, pick up on the babes, drink some wine, get wasted on killer hash--
C: ZED
D: You shouldn't be smoking either.

N: Zed, Oh and Isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they approach the massive solid wooden gates. Official White 63.
C: OH
D: Gee, they're not open. We should probably come back later.
C: ISAAC
D: You just have to knock. They always let me in. Go ahead.
E: to Oh
C: OH
D: Me? Why do I have to knock? What if we're waking somebody up? Let's just get out of here.
C: ZED
D: Where? Back to the penis-cutter? Besides, Eema and Maya might be in there. You want to get them out before the city's destroyed, don't you? Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door.
N: ISAAC (SHOUTING) Hey! Anybody there? Hello? Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries. Isaac quickly runs away.
C: SENTRY
D: Halt! Isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the guards.
E: shouts at him
C: ISAAC
D: You gonna make me? You and what army?
E: dancing and dodging like a boxer
C: ZED
D: Get help! Tell your father!
E: shouts to Isaac
C: ISAAC
D: Yeah!
E: shouts back
N: (MORE) Official White 64. ISAAC (cont'd) Like I'm really gonna tell my father I came with you to Sodom. So long, suckers! He takes off running.

E: to Oh
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GATEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw them up against the wall. THREE OTHER GUARDS look up at the new arrivals.
C: FIRST GUARD
D: What's this now?
C: SENTRY
D: They were banging on the gate. Hebrews, from the look of them.
C: ZED
D: We're not really Hebrews-- The guard smacks him in the mouth. ZED Okay. Lesson learned. No talking.
E: cont'd
C: SENTRY
D: Should we wake the Sergeant?
C: FIRST GUARD
D: You don't want to do that. He gets pretty mean when you wake him.
C: OH
D: Meaner than this? The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly. The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.
N: Official White 65.
C: SERGEANT
D: (from behind the door,
N: ROARS) BLOODY HELL! WHAT'S GOING ON OUT
C: THERE!
D: Zed and Oh exchange worried looks. Then the door flies open and the SERGEANT, a huge, angry, sadistic rhino of a man, fills the door frame. SERGEANT Who the hell screamed? They all point at Oh. SERGEANT I thought it was a woman. He lumbers over and gets his face very close to Oh's. SERGEANT You don't look like a woman, but maybe you want to kiss me anyway. Is that right? You want to kiss me? Oh turns away from his foul breath. The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and practically lifts him off the ground. SERGEANT By morning you'll be sorry you were born.
E: cont'd cont'd glowers at him cont'd cont'd
C: OH
D: Don't have to wait 'til morning.
C: ZED
D: Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed. ZED Which would be difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually are your size-- He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.
E: cont'd quickly backpedaling
N: Official White 66.
C: SERGEANT
D: Get my big stick. I'll deal with the fat one first.
E: to another guard
N: ZED (INSULTED) Relatively fat one. I wouldn't be talking about fat, if I were you. Another blow from the sergeant. ZED (cont'd) Right. Enough said. The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes.
C: SERGEANT
D: Welcome to Sodom. As he takes a big backswing, Zed and Oh shut their eyes and prepare for the worst.
E: to Zed and Oh
C: VOICE
D: Stop! Zed and Oh turn to see Cain at the door, dressed like the other guards in breastplate and helmet.
E: O.C.

D: Cain?
C: CAIN
D: Brothers!! He embraces them. They look confused and doubtful, but relieved.

N: Cain leads them through the narrow crowded streets. People avoid Cain's gaze and part like the Red Sea to allow him through. Official White 67.
C: CAIN
D: You know, you guys are lucky that sergeant is a friend of mine. I let him sodomize me once right after I got here and he's been real nice to me ever since.
N: OH (SARCASTIC) Yeah, thanks for saving us. What are you going to do to us now? Cain stops and looks at them.
C: CAIN
D: wait a second. Do I detect a tone here?
C: ZED
D: All right, honestly? You did sell us into slavery.
C: CAIN
D: Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge much? That was like a fortnight ago.
E: instantly offended
C: ZED
D: That was way less than a fortnight. Half a fortnight, maybe.
C: CAIN
D: Give me a break! I was dealing with the death of a close family member and I needed some space. But now I realize that you guys are like my brothers. And it's so rare to find a brother that you love. Right? He embraces them.
N: ZED AND OH (UNEASILY) Right. CAIN (EXUBERANT) Now, you guys hungry? Watch this. Cain walks up to a food vendor's stall and stares menacingly at the VENDOR. He raises his fist. The vendor cowers. Official White 68. CAIN (CONT'D) (cont'd) (to Vendor) That's two for flinching. Cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to Zed and Oh. CAIN (cont'd) That's the kind of love I'm talkin' about. As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute lounging in a doorway.
C: ZED
D: Check out that woman across the street! She's looking at us. The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth.
C: OH
D: We are so in! She's eye-knowing us like crazy.
C: CAIN
D: You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me. It's crazy. This morning, I almost got a handie behind that pita stand.
C: OH
D: Well, I kind of have a girlfriend-- not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I like, so I shouldn't--
C: CAIN
D: Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays in Sodom. He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT. The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut. CAIN You know, if you guys are staying you should join the guards. The pay's not great, but there's tons of perks. I'm telling you, it's the only way to go. Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away.

S: EXT. BARRACKS - NEXT MORNING
N: A military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the garrison. GUARDSMEN come double-timing out of the barracks and hurry to line up in formation. Last to emerge are Zed and Oh who step leisurely out the door now dressed as Royal Guards. Zed actually looks dashing, but Oh's breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping down over his eyes.
C: ZED
D: This is great! How do I look?
C: OH
D: You look good, but I think my hat's too big. They notice an OFFICER staring at them. OH Do you happen to know where I could get a smaller hat? The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon.
E: cont'd to the officer
N: OFFICER (ROARS) Line up! Zed and Oh hustle into line, orders are shouted and the troop marches off.

N: Zed and Oh are on patrol with Cain in the heart of the city. Official White 70.
C: ZED
D: So is this it? We just walk around?
C: CAIN
D: Pretty much. We just look for troublemakers and kick the living shit out of 'em.
C: ZED
D: What kind of trouble?
C: CAIN
D: If we see a thief or a pickpocket, we just slap him around-- maybe cut off a finger or an ear, or the tip of his nose, lower lip-- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion-- then we take our share of the loot and let him go. Mostly what we worry about are activist types, rabble rousers, getting people all riled up against the King or the Temple Priests. That's death for sure.
C: ZED
D: Pretty harsh, isn't it?
C: CAIN
D: Harsh times, brother. We're in the middle of a famine. People are starving. If we don't get some rain soon, it could get ugly. Then we'll get to start kicking ass big time. He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out. CAIN Beat it, you filthy beggar!
E: looking forward to it cont'd
C: OH
D: You can't blame people for being hungry.
C: CAIN
D: Yeah, well, just remember, it's the palace that pays you, not the people.
N: Official White 71. Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets and turn to look. At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches. Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only one standing. EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big ostrich plume fan. Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty. Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously. As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now elaborately costumed and made-up. Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the entourage passes.
C: ZED
D: Did you see that girl? I think she liked me! She looked right at me.
E: on the ground, excitedly to Oh
C: OH
D: Gee, I wonder why? The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all get back to their feet.
C: ZED
D: Who was she?
C: CAIN
D: The Princess Inanna. She's totally hot, but don't even think about it.
N: Official White 72.
C: ZED
D: Why not?
C: CAIN
D: Because she's royalty and you're scum? The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal entourage.
C: OH
D: Where's everybody going?
C: CAIN
D: To the temple. Let's go. You have to see this.
E: starts walking
N: ZED (FOLLOWING) Will she be there?
C: CAIN
D: Everybody will be there.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TEMPLE SQUARE - MINUTES LATER
N: At the center of the square is a magnificent temple adorned with elaborate carvings and monumental statues of pagan gods. Before it is a great altar in front of a HUGE STONE IDOL. The idol's mouth is a gaping fiery furnace. Behind the temple, is a towering ZIGGURAT still under construction. A HUNDRED TRUMPETERS AND DRUMMERS blast a solemn fanfare as ORNATELY GARBED PRIESTS ceremoniously climb the stairs to the altar.
C: ZED AND OH
D: stare at the spectacle.
C: THE ROYAL PAVILION
D: The Princess Inanna takes her seat near the KING, the QUEEN, the MINISTERS and other NOBLES. Maya stands behind the Princess and continues fanning her. Zed spots the Princess on the pavilion.
N: Official white 73.
C: ZED
D: Hey, there she is! He starts edging toward the royal pavilion.
N: 45 THE PAVILION Under a broad awning, the King and Queen snack from a table covered with platters of exotic fruits and sweetmeats. The King, an imposing man with Shakespearean gravity, wipes his mouth and glances at the Princess Inanna.
C: KING
D: The Princess isn't eating?
C: INANNA
D: I find it hard to eat when so many are hungry.
C: KING
D: Your concern is enviable.
E: as if 
N: INANNA (POUTY) And besides, I'm so fat. The Queen, 40's, still beautiful, reacts.
C: QUEEN
D: You're not fat--
E: for the hundredth time
C: INANNA
D: Yes, I am, mother! Those new linen pants you got me from Egypt make my ass look just huge.
C: QUEEN
D: Well, you can't keep starving yourself.
C: INANNA
D: Why not? Everybody else is starving-- present company excluded.
N: Official White 74.
C: KING
D: Careful, Princess. You may be my step-daughter, but these are dangerous times and those are dangerous words. I weep for the suffering of my people, but the spirit of rebellion is alive in the city and if necessary I will crush it with every means at my disposal.
N: INANNA (SARCASTIC) For the good of the people.
C: KING
D: For the good of everyone who enjoys the favor of the throne.
E: warning her
C: INANNA
D: Whatever. I'm just so incredibly bored.
C: THE TEMPLE DOORS
D: The fanfare climaxes as the great temple doors slowly open and the HIGH PRIEST emerges followed by a retinue of PRIESTESSES and a dozen VESTAL VIRGINS. They walk in solemn silence to ritual positions around the altar. The High Priest is even more elaborately costumed than the nobles, ridiculously so, standing very tall on high platform shoes, with heavy eye makeup, his hair and beard even oilier than the others. He turns to the altar, raises his hands to the heavens and begins his invocation.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: O El, lord of Heaven and Earth; Baal, the Sublime; Shapash, goddess of the sun; Hadad, the storm god, over-ruling son of Dagon, the bountiful, god of grain, our earthly sustenance--
E: intoning pompously
C: ZED
D: He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion and stares up at the Princess Inanna. She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice.
N: Official white 75.
C: INANNA
D: Isn't that the idiot who was standing up in the street? Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming. The High Priest continues.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: We come before you in humble supplication, invoking your blessing, the sweet rain which waters our fields, enriches the harvest, fills our storehouses, makes mighty the house of Ish-ka-bi- baal and the city of Sodom-- The King nods graciously. HIGH PRIEST --and feeds us, your children, with the bounty of your grace.
E: cont'd
C: PRINCESS INANNA
D: She glances at Zed again, but this time a slight smile crosses her lips. Zed grins back at her. The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and subtly points Zed out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too vigorously.
N: THE ALTAR
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Accept now this humble sacrifice to the power and glory of your magnificence. He starts inspecting the Vestal Virgins, beautiful young women in diaphanous, almost transparent white gowns.
C: ZED AND OH
D: have no idea what's going on. Zed turns to the GUY NEXT TO
N: HIM. Official White 76.
C: ZED
D: What's happening?
C: GUY
D: He's picking a virgin.
N: CAIN (LASCIVIOUS) Oh yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh.
C: AT THE ALTAR
D: the High Priest is moving down the line of beautiful young maidens. He comes to one SLUTTY GIRL who seems so obviously not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of the line.
C: ZED AND OH
D: watching curiously.
C: ZED
D: What do they want a virgin for?
C: GUY
D: To throw into the fire.
N: ZED (SHOCKED) Why?
C: GUY
D: Offering to the Gods. There's a famine going on. If we don't make a good sacrifice, it won't rain. No rain, no harvest. No harvest, no food. Get it?
E: like talking to an idiot
C: CAIN
D: It's pretty self-explanatory.
C: OH
D: You throw the virgin in the fire so it'll rain?
C: GUY
D: Duh.
C: ZED
D: Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me.
N: Official white 77. OH (CONCERNED) These virgins-- it's always a girl, right?
C: AT THE ALTAR
D: A great cheer goes up as a girl is chosen. She swoons as the priestesses slip off her vestment and two priests escort her to the fiery mouth of the furnace.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: For the love of the Gods and the glory of their Creation, the great dome of Heaven, the green growing Earth, we commit this maiden to your Holy Fire. Another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the fire.
N: ZED (APPALLED) This is just crazy. Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still don't recognize her.
C: MAYA
D: The Princess wishes to see you.
E: eyes downcast
C: CAIN
D: Her wish is my command.
E: staring at her cleavage
C: MAYA
D: Not you. Him.
E: points at Zed
C: ZED
D: Me? Cool. We're kind of a package deal. Can he come with?
E: then, motioning to Oh
C: CAIN
D: The three of us are inseparable. We're like brothers. Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an artificial smile.
N: Official White 78. Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh.
C: MAYA
D: The two of you follow me.
C: ZED
D: I'll try to put in a good word for you. Cain fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya.
E: to Cain
T: CUT TO:
S: 47 EXT. PALACE - LATER
N: A SQUAD OF SENTRIES stands guard at the massive iron palace gates. A CROWD OF BEGGARS is pressed against the gate pleading for food. Zed and Oh approach led by Maya. The guards brutally push the beggars aside and they enter.
S: 48 INT. PALACE - COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS
N: Maya leads Zed and Oh through the gate and into a beautiful atrium where they are met by a fat bald EUNUCH wearing the royal livery.
C: MAYA
D: This is Zaftig the Eunuch. You go with him. Oh is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the opposite direction.
E: to Oh
C: OH
D: Can't I go with him?
C: EUNUCH
D: Why? Is he your lover?
C: OH
D: Hah! No? That would be weird.
E: laughs at the thought
C: LOVERS--
D: The Eunuch just shrugs, apparently not that weird to him. OH
E: cont'd
N: (COVERING) So what do you do? Official White 79.
C: EUNUCH
D: I serve the royal family-- little of this, little of that. I've been a palace eunuch since I was nine years old.
C: OH
D: You've been living here since you were nine? I should look into that. How do you get to be a eunuch?
E: looks around, impressed
N: EUNUCH (MATTER-OF-FACT)
T: They cut off your testicles.
N: OH (HORRIFIED) What?! What's up with all the genital mutilation? EUNUCH (SHRUGS) Trust me, after a while you don't even miss them. OH (EMPHATIC) No, I'd miss them-- I'm sure. I hardly got to use them yet. The Eunuch leads him down the corridor.
T: CUT TO:
N: A SHEEP'S HEART, LIVER AND GUTS land with a wet splat on a polished marble table.
S: INT. PALACE THRONE ROOM - SAME TIME
N: The High Priest, an extremely vain, officious, and fussy man, still over-dressed in sacramental drag, pushes back his sleeves and starts examining the entrails as the King and his MINISTERS look on, deeply concerned.
C: KING
D: Six sacrifices in the last ten days and still no rain. What do the entrails predict?
N: Official White 80.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Well, the liver is streaked with gray-- that's not a favorable sign-- but the heart looks good. See how nice and red it is here. That's always a good omen.
E: nervously poking at the sheep heart
C: KING
D: What does it mean?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself, probably sticking to a high-fiber diet of grass and hay.
C: KING
D: What does it mean for us?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Well, it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart-- or that you're going on a long sea voyage! Wouldn't that be fun?
N: KING (SCORNFUL) How did you become High Priest?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Because I'm your brother?
C: PRIME MINISTER
D: Perhaps it's time for a new High Priest.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Perhaps it's not time for a new High Priest. Aaaahh! He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime Minister, as if wielding the power of the Gods. Nothing happens. HIGH PRIEST And let that be a warning to you. Next time, I will hurl a lightning bolt at your face.
E: his eyes go wide cont'd
N: (MORE) Official White 81. HIGH PRIEST (cont'd) (CONSIDERS) Or a fire-ball.
C: PRIME MINISTER
D: Majesty, there's talk of revolution in the streets. Grain and oil are scarce, prices are high, starving peasants are pouring into the city looking for food--
E: ignores him
C: KING
D: Poverty has a bitter taste, but it's the flavor they were born to. It's the will of the Gods. The Queen and Princess Inanna are lounging on cushioned divans, listening.
N: INANNA (BLASE) Can the Gods really be so cruel?
C: QUEEN
D: I don't think that's cruel. It's just practical. If everybody was rich, who'd wait on us? Maya approaches and whispers something to the Princess.
C: INANNA
D: Good. See that he's bathed and dressed, then bring him to me. Maya frowns and exits. INANNA This should be amusing.
E: cont'd to the queen
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - LATER
N: Maya leads Zed down a grand hallway. Zed is now wearing a long flowing robe of silk brocade, fine sandals, and jewelry. His hair has been combed and pulled back into a loose ponytail. He stops to admire himself in a mirror.
C: ZED
D: What do you think, ponytail or no ponytail? You know what?
N: (MORE) Official White 82. ZED (cont'd) I'll start with the ponytail, see where the night takes me. Maya rolls her eyes and leads Zed to the entrance of the Great Hall. Cain and another guard are posted at the door. ZED (cont'd) Hey, you made it! What's it like inside? CAIN (POINTED) I wouldn't know.- I'm just a guard because my "brother" didn't pull any strings with his friends in the royal court.
C: ZED
D: Look, first of all, we're not actually brothers---
C: CAIN
D: Just like Abel. I oughta just bash your head in--
C: ZED
D: Hey! You didn't let me finish. As soon as I get in there I'm going to talk to somebody and get you invited, okay?
N: CAIN (UNCONVINCED) Yeah, sure. Have a nice orgy. Cain pulls open the big doors and Zed steps through the portal. Cain tries to steal peeks inside as the heavy doors slam shut.
T: CUT TO:
C: ZED'S POV
D: A full-scale ORGY is going on in a magnificent hall. As Maya leads him into the room, Zed pulls his hair out of the ponytail.
C: ZED
D: Feels like a hair-down kinda scene, don't you think?
N: Official White 83.
C: MAYA
D: As you wish.
N: (POINTEDLY) Be sure to try the fruit. Zed looks at her and finally recognizes her.
C: ZED
D: Maya?! What are you doing here?
C: MAYA
D: I had no choice. I'm a slave, remember?
C: ZED
D: I was going to rescue you! Really! In fact, we came here to find you.
C: MAYA
D: Wait here until you're sent for.
E: not buying it
C: ZED
D: This wasn't my idea, you know.
C: MAYA
D: Of course not. You were just chosen again. Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself. She walks off before he can answer. Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS walking past a row of "LIVING STATUES," semi-nude men and women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint, frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful bodies. Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude "GODDESS", then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess slaps his hand, then resumes her pose.
C: GODDESS
D: watch it, jerk!
C: ZED
D: Hey! You're a real girl! That is so cool.
N: Official White 84. He moves down the row of living sculptures, mugging at them, mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to make them move, but they remain frozen. ZED (cont'd) Amazing! He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take. This one is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long, shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in obvious embarrassment. ZED (cont'd) (recognizing him) Oh? Oh looks down from his pedestal.
C: OH
D: I'm not supposed to talk. I'm a statue.
E: through clenched teeth
C: ZED
D: Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it going?
C: OH
D: How's it going? I just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls, and believe me, he was very thorough, if you know what I mean. How's it going with you?
C: ZED
D: Not bad. Had a little rub and a scrub, now I'm up for some grub.
C: OH
D: That sounds nice-- for you.
C: ZED
D: Hey! You'll never guess who's here- - Maya! She's working here-- and she looks great! But she's kinda mad at me. Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of food.
N: Official White 85.
C: OH
D: There's Eema! Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.
C: SARGON
D: Stand still, wench! I want to see what's under that skirt. As he starts to lift her hem, she drops the whole tray of food on him. His cohorts laugh.
C: EEMA
D: I'm sorry! It was an accident.
C: SARGON
D: That was no accident! Sargon grabs her and raises his hand to hit her. Zed steps in quickly.
C: ZED
D: You! Slave girl! (he pulls her away from
C: SARGON)
D: I told you to fetch me more wine! Apologize to this officer--- now!
C: EEMA
D: I'm sorry.
C: ZED
D: Now go-- fetch! Wait by that-- skinny statue. I'll deal with you later. As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs. ZED Slaves-- what are you gonna do?
E: cont'd
C: SARGON
D: Try using a hot poker. That they understand.
C: ZED
D: Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep that in mind.
N: Official White 86. Zed bows, then leaves him and joins Eema who is waiting at Oh's pedestal. Zed (cont'd) What are you doing here?
C: EEMA
D: We were sold to the palace. But I won't serve these people! I'd rather die!
C: ZED
D: Keep that up and you will.
C: EEMA
D: What are you doing here? Have you joined them?
E: notices his clothes
C: OH
D: I haven't joined anything. Does this look like fun? They both look accusingly at Zed.
E: re the gold body paint
C: ZED
D: Okay, I know what you're thinking, but I'm just checking it out. We kept hearing that this place was so evil, but now that I look around I'm thinking maybe it's not all bad. There's a lot to learn here.
C: OH
D: What? Like human sacrifice?
C: ZED
D: No! Like the wheel, for instance! That's pretty awesome-- the way it just goes around in a circle. And farming! And metal-- writing, money, pottery-- hot baths. Come on! Back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough.
C: EEMA
D: What happened to him?
E: to Oh
N: Official White 87.
C: ZED
D: Look, I think I've been chosen to do something great with my life--
C: OH
D: Here we go again--
C: ZED
D: --and I don't think it's hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets. Maya returns for Zed.
N: MAYA (COOLLY) She wants to see you-- now.
C: ZED
D: I hope you don't think I'm interested in her.
N: MAYA (MIFFED) Why would I think that? Just because you couldn't take your eyes off her--
C: ZED
D: I'm just using her, Maya! It's part of my plan. I'm going to get you all out of here as soon as I can.
N: MAYA (SKEPTICAL) What's your plan?
C: ZED
D: It's a secret.
E: not a clue
C: MAYA
D: Forget it. Maya sees A GUARD watching them and reverts to her slave attitude. MAYA The Princess awaits you.
E: not buying it cont'd bowing to Zed
N: Official White 88.
C: ZED
D: And I await her. You two await me. Stay out of trouble. I'll be back. He exits with Maya.
E: to Oh and Eema then confidentially to Eema and Oh
C: EEMA
D: He has no idea what he's doing, does he?
C: OH
D: I don't know. So much has happened. Sometimes I think-- She walks away. OH I love you.
E: cont'd wistfully, to himself
C: THE HIGH PRIEST
D: Lounging on a divan surrounded by YOUNG MEN. Oh walks by still painted gold.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: You there! Golden boy! Rub me with oil. The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets his rich outer robe fall to the floor. His chest, back and shoulders are incredibly hairy.
E: to Oh
C: OH
D: I'd rather not, if you don't mind. I'm not really a slave. I'm a guard.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Then maybe you'd rather I speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life. Or perhaps I whip you myself? How would you like that?
C: OH
D: Are those my choices?
N: Official White 89.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: I'd say so. The High Priest lies back down. Oh looks around, finds a pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the High Priest's hairy chest.
C: OH
D: How's that?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: More.
C: OH
D: That enough?
E: splashes a few more drops on him
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: No! More oil! Much more, you insolent dolt! Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders. HIGH PRIEST That's good. Now rub it in.
E: getting angry cont'd
N: OH (APPALLED) With my hands?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Do it! Oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his hairy chest and shoulders. HIGH PRIEST Mmmmm, I love it. The sweet scent of precious oil. The oily-- oiliness. Eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging the High Priest. She gasps.
E: cont'd in ecstasy
N: OH (EMBARRASSED) Eema! This isn't what you think. Official White 90. EEMA (FLUSTERED) No, it's fine. I understand. This really explains a lot about you that I didn't get before.
C: OH
D: No, really! I'm just-- rubbing oil on this man. She exits.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Mnum imam. I have an idea. Why don't we go back to my place and see what's under all that paint?
N: OH (DISGUSTED) Ughh.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRINCESS'S CHAMBER - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
N: Maya ushers Zed into the dimly lit room.
C: MAYA
D: Good luck.
N: ZED
C: MAYA--
D: She leaves him. A haze of heavily scented incense hangs in the air.
C: INANNA
D: Come to me. Zed turns and sees the Princess standing on the terrace.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. GARDEN TERRACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Zed steps out onto the moonlit terrace. He crosses to the balustrade and stands beside the Princess, gazing out over the twinkling cityscape.
C: INANNA
D: Beautiful, isn't it? You can see Gomorrah just over the hill.
N: Official White 91.
C: ZED
D: I didn't know it was so close.
C: INANNA
D: They're called the "twin cities."
C: ZED
D: Looks pretty from up here, but some people think God is going to wipe them out because they're so evil.
C: INANNA
D: And what do you think? Am I evil?
E: toying with him
C: ZED
D: I don't really know you. But you don't look evil.
C: PRINCESS
D: Do you find me attractive?
C: ZED
D: Well, yeah. I think you're-- incredible.
C: INANNA
D: I have body issues.
E: moving closer
C: ZED
D: No, you're perfect. Your face, your hair-- Your eyes are like the sea.
E: looking into her eyes
C: INANNA
D: My eyes are brown.
E: a beat
C: ZED
D: Well, it's kinda dark. I took a shot. I know they're big, though-- and wet-- She pulls him close. ZED Can I ask you one thing? What would a girl like you want with a guy like me?
E: cont'd
N: Official white 92.
C: INANNA
D: I don't know. I just find you-- interesting. They say it's the will of the gods that some men should suffer while others rule-- that we're all just victims of our fate. And I believed that until this morning when I saw you standing up, alone, in the square. And I said to myself, finally here's one man who refuses to bow down to anything--
N: ZED
C: UH--
D: Yeah. That's me.
E: considers explaining but just lets it go
C: INANNA
D: Yes, finally a man who has the courage to question the order of things--- a man chosen by the Gods to do something great.
N: ZED (EXHILARATED) That's exactly what I've been thinking! You wouldn't believe the things that have been happening to me lately. I just didn't know why.
C: INANNA
D: I know why. To bring you here-- to this place-- to me.
E: gets very, very close
N: ZED (SMITTEN) I couldn't agree more. I'm trying to agree more, but I can't. That's how much I agree.
C: INANNA
D: Come. She takes his hand and leads him away. A SHADOWY FIGURE watches them from behind a curtain.
T: CUT TO:
N: Official White 93.
S: 55 EXT. THE TEMPLE - NIGHT
N: We can see torchlight flickering inside the temple and TWO FIGURES moving among the pillars.
S: INT. THE TEMPLE - SAME TIME
N: The High Priest is giving Oh a personal tour of the inner sanctum. Oh is scrubbed and dressed like a junior priest.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: My life is devoted to the service of the Gods and the good of the people. I take nothing for myself. He has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every finger, and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and emeralds.
C: OH
D: That's so-- unselfish of you.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Yes, it is. It's just so-- lonely. Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being.
N: (COY) Here's a riddle: what has two thumbs and wants another oil rub? (pointing thumbs at
C: HIMSELF)
D: This-guy. Ohquickly changes the subject.
C: OH
D: So where does that hall lead to?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Come, I'll show you. He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols. HIGH PRIEST Behind those doors is the Holy of Holies-- the earthly domain of the
E: his eyes light up cont'd
N: (MORE) Official White HIGH PRIEST (cont'd) Gods-- a place so ineffably sacred, so powerful, that to enter is instant death for any mortal.
C: OH
D: Wow. So who cleans it?
E: a long beat
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: it needs no cleaning.
C: OH
D: No, of course not. Kind of makes you wonder though-- the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out?
E: can't let go of it
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: I assume they finished it, then the Gods descended.
E: starting to get annoyed
C: OH
D: Yeah, that's probably it. So you're saying we can't go in?
E: another long beat
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: I just told you! To enter is instant death! Only I can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings.
N: OH (QUICKLY) Right, right, right. (BEAT) What if we just open the doors and stick our heads in?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Fine! Enough! I'm sorry I brought it up. Let's go. Move. Move. He shoos him down the hall.
E: pushes Oh along
N: Official White 95.
S: 57 INT. TEMPLE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zed and Princess Inanna stealthily enter the temple.
C: ZED
D: What are we doing here?
E: looking around nervously
C: INANNA
D: I want you to enter the Holy of Holies.
C: ZED
D: Yes! Finally. Now you're talking! Should I enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom? Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or--?
N: INANNA (POINTS) That's the Holy of Holies-- you have to go in there and talk to the Gods.
C: ZED
D: The Gods are in there?
C: INANNA
D: So they say, but the only one who ever goes in is the High Priest. They say it's instant death for anyone else to enter.
C: ZED
D: Then why am I going in?
N: INANNA (IMPATIENT) Because you were chosen? If the Gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already. ZED RIGHT--
C: INANNA
D: This is what you've been chosen for! To speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city. Then come back out and tell me what it's like inside.
N: Official White 96.
C: ZED
D: Right-- right. Then again, if the rules say--
E: mulling it over
C: INANNA
D: Do you always follow the rules?
C: ZED
D: What is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules? You-all have this bad boy complex---- She kisses him fiercely on the lips.
C: INANNA
D: Do this for me.
C: ZED
D: I'm going in. He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOLY OF HOLIES - CONTINUOUS
N: Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates himself, face down on the floor, arms outstretched in supplication. He lies there with his eyes tightly shut, expecting to be vaporized any second. A long moment passes in total silence. Then he opens his eyes and looks around tentatively. The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights above.
C: ZED
D: Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for-- not like-- killing me, and letting me receive the, uh, blessing of your holy-- godliness. He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine response. Nothing comes.
E: takes a deep breath and starts improvising
N: Official White 97. ZED (cont'd) (props himself up on his
C: ELBOWS)
D: Okay, I don't know the right words-- so I'm just going to say what I have to say-- if that's all right. I know I haven't always done the right thing. Eating the fruit was bad, I know that-- and the Cain thing-- and I have done somethings with women-- I do love the ladies-- well, you probably know all that because you're watching everything-- Do you really watch everything? That's got to be a little disgusting sometimes-- but probably pretty hot, too--
E: waits for a response, gets none, proceeds a thought occurs
N: (QUICKLY) Not that you would get off on any of it-- okay, I'm getting off the subject. Anyways, the word is you've been considering destroying this place. So I'm asking you not to-- as a personal favor. (NOTHING) Feel free to jump in anytime. I could use a little guidance here. Still no response. He rolls over onto his back. ZED (cont'd) Look, I know you think this place is evil and it kinda is-- I see that-- but that's not everybody. There are a lot of good people, too. So what if there were, like, fifty really good people? Would you still destroy the city? (SILENCE) Okay, you're right, that may be a reach. How about twenty? I could probably get you twenty extremely good people if I really looked around. (SILENCE) How about five? Five awesome people-- including myself. I personally know at least five people worth saving. Does that sound good? (MORE) Official White 98. ZED (cont'd) (NOTHING) Hello? A little help? Am I getting warm here? Okay, is it me? Are you punishing me for stuff I did? (an insight) Or setting me up for what I need to do. Or both! Or neither? (NOTHING) Could you give me some kind of a sign-- please-- anything? Zed listens but hears only a profound silence. Then a revelation. He sits up on the floor. ZED (cont'd) Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The silence? Is that it? (waits for confirmation) It is, isn't it! Just this really silent-- silence. (PONDERING) You're not going to tell me what to do; it's up to me to decide what's right and what's wrong-- right? Is that it? You're not going to speak to me-- you're going to speak through me? If that's right, don't say anything. (listens for a beat) Okay, I read you loud and clear. Thank you. (an afterthought) Oh, and if things don't work out with Maya would it be okay with you if me and the Princess had a little "carnal knowledge"? Not in an evil way or anything-- (he listens; silence) Okay! You're right, probably not a good idea. Thank you. He backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way.
T: CUT TO:
S: 59 INT. THE TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS
N: The doors to the Holy of Holies opens and Zed comes backing out, still bowing and muttering. Then he turns and his face falls. Official White 99. The High Priest, the King, the Queen, and a dozen Temple Acolytes are staring at him in amazement. Oh stands beside the High Priest dressed just like him.
C: ZED
D: I was just looking for the bathroom.
N: INANNA (INNOCENTLY) I told him not to go in. HIGH PRIEST (SHRIEKS) Seize them!
C: OH
D: Seize him! The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed.
E: scared, points at Zed
N: CAIN (SMIRKING) Should've invited me to the party.
T: CUT TO:
S: 60 INT. DUNGEON - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: In the dim torchlight, we see Zed hanging spread-eagle five feet off the ground, his arms and legs stretched out wide and tightly bound to iron rings imbedded in the stone. Oh is shackled to the wall beside him, hanging upside down. They hear the faint scream of a man being tortured somewhere deep in the prison.
C: ZED
D: I wish I was upside down. Looks fun. Oh won't talk to him. ZED So this is it? We're not friends anymore? After all I've done for you?
E: cont'd
N: Official White 100.
C: OH
D: What have you done for me? I've been attacked by a cougar, I've fallen down a mountain, I almost had the tip of my thingy cut off, I've been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now I'm hanging upside down in a dungeon. And I have to pee real bad. All because of you. You call yourself a friend? Name one good thing you've done for me.
C: ZED
D: I've helped you come out of your shell.
C: OH
D: I really have to pee--
E: in distress
C: ZED
D: Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and I may have made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand-- I'm a chosen. That's a lot of responsibility -- you can't even imagine.
N: OH (ANGRY) The only one who thinks you're chosen is you, so shut up already! ZED (STUNG) Okay, be mad, but I'm going to get us out of here, if it's the last thing I do. Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail. ZED (cont'd) That was just my first idea-- and I'm also accepting ideas. OH (SHOUTS) Guard! I have to pee! Now! Seriously! (can't hold it anymore) Oh, no-- Official White 101. Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach, over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his face. OH (cont'd) I hate you.
T: CUT TO:
S: 61 EXT. PUBLIC SQUARE - EARLY MORNING
N: A curious, jeering MOB is gathering as Zed and Oh, in shackles, are led by a SQUAD OF GUARDS to a raised platform in the middle of the square. The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd. Cain presides over the execution. He addresses the crowd.
C: CAIN
D: For the crimes of blasphemy-- (the crowd grumbles its
N: DISAPPROVAL)
C: HERESY--
E: grumble, grumble
C: CONSPIRACY--
E: serious grumbling
C: SODOMY--
D: And the murder of my brother Abel--
E: admiring oohs and aahs
C: ZED
D: Oh, come on!
C: CAIN
D: Shut up! For these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but we're pretty sure they were thinking about, the prisoners will be stoned to death. The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw. Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other.
C: PALACE BALCONY
D: The King, Queen, High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the stoning from their vantage point above the square. Princess Inanna refuses to look.
N: Official White 102.
C: KING
D: Observe, my dear. It seems the least you could do, since it was you who lured him to his death. She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed.
C: INANNA
D: I didn't intend for this to happen.
C: THE SQUARE
D: The people move in and surround the platform on all sides, baseball-size rocks in their hands.
C: CAIN
D: Anything to say before the sentence is carried out?
E: to Zed and Oh
C: ZED
D: I just want to say this is really messed up--
E: to the crowd
N: CAIN OKAY-- (SHOUTS)
C: STONE THEM!
D: The people fling their rocks with all their might. Zed and Oh duck. The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in the head, some falling down unconscious. Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks from all directions. CAIN Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This isn't working.
E: cont'd
C: ZED
D: Can I make a suggestion?
N: CAIN (IRKED) What? Official White 103.
C: ZED
D: Why don't you just pick one person to throw? The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement. ZED In fact, don't you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person who stones us? Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently fair.
E: cont'd pressing the advantage
C: CROWD
D: Yes! Ooh, me! Pick me! Me!
E: some eagerly raising their hands and waving like school children
C: ON THE BALCONY
D: The King grabs Sargon.
C: KING
D: What is that idiot doing?
E: re Cain
C: IN THE SQUARE
D: Zed spots a good candidate in the crowd.
C: ZED
D: We pick him! Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his hand.
C: CAIN
D: Him?
C: ZED
D: No, next to him! He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big.
C: CAIN
D: He's just a kid!
N: Official White 104.
C: ZED
D: So? You got something against kids? Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval. ZED This guy hates kids!
E: cont'd
C: CROWD
D: Yeah! What's he got against kids? Children are the future! Give the kid a shot! The kid! The kid! On the balcony, the King shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by the power of the mob. He nods to Sargon who signals to Cain.
C: CAIN
D: All right! All right! We'll try it. Kid! Grab a rock. The boy picks up a good-size rock. Zed turns to Oh.
C: ZED
D: Good thinking, huh? They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws. The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers. ZED Holy shit! That kid's got an arm!
E: cont'd
N: OH (DAZED) I think he hit me. The boy fires again. Oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the head. OH (cont'd) Hey! There's two of us! The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back.
C: CAIN
D: Okay, everybody on this side now! On the count of three! One-- two--
N: Official white 105.
C: ZED
D: Wait! I have a question for the King! The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony. ZED Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies? On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question. One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be stumped. In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the initiative. ZED I entered the Holy of Holies and, lo, I did not die! Why? Because I am chosen by the Gods!
E: cont'd shouts to the King cont'd
C: PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
D: He is chosen! He is the Chosen One. The Chosen One! Zed gives Oh a look: "See? I told you."
C: THE CROWD
D: Spare the Chosen One! Spare the Chosen One! Spare the Chosen One!
E: starts chanting
C: OH
D: And his friend! Don't forget his friend! On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer with the High Priest.
C: KING
D: Could it be? Is he truly chosen?
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: I don't-- I suppose it's possible- I'd have to examine some new
N: INTESTINES--
C: KING
D: Imbecile!
N: Official White 106.
C: PRIME MINISTER
D: Majesty, with respect, whether he's chosen or not is no longer the issue. To kill him now, given the public mood, could inflame the situation enough to prompt a radical "regime change," if you take my meaning. The King looks grimly at his ministers, all of whom have lean and hungry looks. Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him.
T: CUT TO:
N: 62 SARGON addressing the crowd in the square.
C: SARGON
D: By order of the King, the sentence has been commuted. The crowd cheers. Zed and Oh exchange hopeful looks.
N: CAIN (PLAINTIVE) Can't we just stone them a little?
C: SARGON
D: It is the judgement of our most merciful King that the prisoners are to be enslaved to toil at hard labor until they die of exhaustion or starvation.
C: ZED
D: Yes!
E: exuberant fist pump
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE ZIGGURAT - DAY
N: Oh is up to his knees in a mud pit, trampling straw into the thick mud. A Guard cracks a bullwhip which flicks painfully across his shoulders. Official white 107.
C: OH
D: Okay, you think that actually makes anybody work harder? It just makes them resent you. Is that what you want?
C: GUARD
D: Faster!
E: whips him again
C: OH
D: Can I just ask when lunch is? The whip lashes out again. Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace.
C: THE BRICK YARD
D: Marlak and Enmebaragesi are stacking bricks when zed approaches.
C: ZED
D: Hey! Boys! Long time no see. They glance up, but ignore him. ZED Don't tell me you're still mad about Maya. That's so over. I have a thing going with the princess now-- well, almost had a thing. I'm a slave now-- just like you.
E: greets them cont'd
C: MARLAK
D: No. You're not just like me.
C: ZED
D: Okay. We do have our differences-- like about a cup and half of brain tissue-- but that doesn't mean we can't work together. Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick.
N: GUARD #2 Take those bricks to the top. The masons are waiting. Official white 108. Marlak and Enmebaragesi glower at the guard as they pick up ropes and harness themselves to a cart loaded with bricks. GUARD #2 (cont'd) (to Zed) You! Help them! He grabs another rope harness off the cart and throws it to Zed.
C: ZED
D: You know, I'd like to, but I did something to my neck-- I must've slept on it funny-- those dungeon pillows are like rocks-- well, they are rocks-- so I should probably take it easy or I'll be no damn good for work tomorrow.
E: massages his neck
N: GUARD #2 (strikes him across the back with his stick) I said move!
C: ZED
D: Okay! But I should tell you, this isn't really my area. I'm just on a break from the mud department-- The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed.
N: GUARD #2 One more word and you die--
C: ZED
D: Okay, okay. I'm going. (to Marlak and
E: putting on the harness
C: ENMEBARAGESI)
D: Okay, boys, on the count of three. One-- two-- three! Marlak and Enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes, but Zed makes no effort to pull. They glare at him. ZED Learned that from Maya. Good trick, huh? Okay, together this time. Go!
E: cont'd
N: Official White 109. They pull together and the heavy cart starts to move.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT - LATER
N: Zed, Marlak and Enmebaragesi haul the heavy cart of bricks to the very top of the tower. TWO BRICKLAYERS are working on the wall. Zed leans against the wall next to them tb rest.
C: ZED
D: How high you guys think we're going with this?
C: BRICKLAYER ONE
D: Up to Heaven, I guess. That's how tall they usually build 'em.
C: ZED
D: That's ambitious.
E: looking up
C: BRICKLAYER TWO
D: We worked on the Tower of Babel. Now that was a ziggurat.
C: BRICKLAYER ONE
D: Incredible erection. Zed looks down at his crotch.
N: ZED (MODESTLY) That's nothing. You should see it when I'm excited.
C: BRICKLAYER ONE
D: The tower.
C: ZED
D: Oh, right, the tower. Incredible erection.
E: snickers to himself
C: BRICKLAYER ONE
D: See, the Egyptians are working on an entirely different concept. Four sides, slanting walls, pointy top.
N: Official White 110.
C: BRICKLAYER TWO
D: Like a pyramid?
C: BRICKLAYER ONE
D: Exactly.
C: BRICKLAYER TWO
D: Wow. Far out. Yet timeless in a way. A SLAVE CHILD approaches with a water bucket.
C: SLAVE CHILD
D: Want some water? As the child offers him the ladle, Zed recognizes her.
E: to Zed
C: ZED
D: You're from the village, aren't you? The child nods. ZED I bet you wish you were back there right now, don't you. The child nods again. ZED Well, don't give up. You're going to get home someday. Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over.
E: cont'd cont'd
C: MARLAK
D: Who's going to take her there? The Chosen One? Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed's face. Zed just lies there and takes it, feeling like he's failed everyone. Then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares coming from the temple square below.
E: standing over him
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE MUD PITS - SAME TIME
N: Oh and the other slaves are mustered by the guards. Official White 111.
C: GUARD
D: Get in line! Now! Move!
C: OH
D: Where're we going?
C: GUARD
D: To watch the sacrifice. The King demands it.
C: OH
D: Is that compulsory? Because I saw one when I first got here and it made me a little sick-- The guard's whip catches him across the back. OH Ow! Why don't you try using your words for a change?
E: cont'd
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TEMPLE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
N: The square is filling up with people. The ROYAL PROCESSION is moving to the seats of honor to watch the sacrifice. Cain is now among the Royal Guard having been promoted for his treachery. He bows and helps the Queen to her seat.
C: CAIN
D: At your service, my lady. Anytime, anywhere.
E: leering seductively
N: QUEEN (FLIRTATIOUS) There's a depraved thought. You're so delightfully low. Absolute filth. CAIN (SUAVELY) Thank you, your majesty. He touches his tongue to the tip of his nose and waggles his eyebrows. The King arrives with Sargon to loud booing from the crowd. Official White 112.
C: KING
D: Are they booing me? How dare they!
C: CAIN
D: Your Highness, with all due respect, those were "Woos." They love you. They were "wooing" you. The King looks doubtfully at the hostile crowd.
C: SARGON
D: All is in readiness, Majesty.
C: INANNA
D: What now? More virgins to sacrifice?
E: glares at the King
C: KING
D: Yes, two, followers of the Chosen One, discovered by this loyal soldier. Cain bows to the King.
C: CAIN
D: Just doing my duty.
C: KING
D: And one more to demonstrate our own faith and charity. The King stands and makes a proclamation loud enough for everyone to hear. KING In supplication to the Gods, for the love of the People, we offer a humble sacrifice to the sacred temple fire-- our own step- daughter, the Princess Inanna! The crowd gasps. KING For the good of the people.
E: cont'd cont'd to Inanna
C: QUEEN
D: You wouldn't dare!
E: stands in protest
N: Official white 113.
C: KING
D: Wouldn't I? If you like, I could arrange for you to join her. The Queen slowly sits back down. KING How long did you think I'd tolerate your insolence? Burn her.- Sargon and Cain seize Inanna, but she shrugs them off and rises with dignity.
E: cont'd to Inanna to Sargon
C: INANNA
D: I'll see you all in Hell.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE GREAT STONE IDOL
D: The flames are starting to build inside the idol's mouth.
S: EXT. TEMPLE SQUARE - SAME TIME
N: Oh and the slaves are confined behind a barrier, watched by a squad of guards, waiting for the ceremony to start. THE TEMPLE DOORS open slowly, and the High Priest appears holding a long jewelled staff. Oh turns to the EDOMITE SLAVE next to him.
C: OH
D: See the High Priest? I know him. Dear friend of mine.
E: casually name-dropping
C: THE TEMPLE
D: Now the procession of SACRIFICIAL VIRGINS is led out by the HIGH PRIESTESS. Maya and Eema are among them, their hands tied. They look like they've been drugged. Oh spots Eema and Maya among the virgins.
N: Official White 114. OH (PANICKED) That's Eema! And Maya! I know them! EDOMITE SLAVE (SARCASTIC) I guess you know everybody, don't you. Oh shoulders his way right up to the barrier where a BIG GUARD stops him with a spear to his neck.
C: BIG GUARD
D: That's far enough, slave. Oh stops right there, frustrated and frightened.
C: THE TEMPLE
D: Inanna is led out last, now also having been drugged.
C: TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT
D: Zed, Marlak and the sharp-eyed Enmebaragesi look down, trying to see what's going on.
C: ENMEBARAGESI
D: They're bringing out the women.
N: ZED (AMAZED) How are you seeing that far?
C: ENMEBARAGESI
D: I see your sister, Eema--
N: TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT ZED (SQUINTING) It's Maya!
T: CUT TO:
C: THE TEMPLE
D: The drums and trumpets kick up the tempo and the High Priest starts leading the virgins to the idol's fiery mouth. Oh pushes against the barrier, restrained by the guard.
N: Official White 115.
C: OH
D: We have to do something! Somebody has to stop it. (turning to the other
C: SLAVES)
D: We can't let them do this! The slaves start to mutter. The guards draw their swords and heft their spears, now on high alert.
T: CUT TO:
C: TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT
D: Zed looks around desperately, trying to figure out what to do.
C: ZED
D: I have to get down there.
E: to Marlak
N: GUARD #2 (SNORTS) Over my dead body.
C: MARLAK
D: All right. Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams all the way down.
C: ZED
D: Wow. Who saw that coming? Thanks, Marlak.
C: MARLAK
D: Now what? Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end.
C: ZED
D: Lower me down. Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope.
E: looping the rope around his waist
N: Official White 116. Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding.
T: CUT TO:
C: ZED
D: He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and slow him down.
N: ZED (CALLING) Any time now, Marlak! Marlak and Enmebaragesi watch his descent, dumbly interested in what happens next. Zed sees he's not slowing down and tries to swing himself onto one of the upper levels of the ziggurat. However, when he swings in, he hits a cart loaded with bricks and bounces off painfully.
C: THE BRICK CART
D: The sudden jolt dislodges the wheel chock that was holding the cart on the sloping ramp of the tower. The cart starts to roll down the ramp, gathering speed as it careens toward the edge.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE HIGH PRIEST
D: He raises his staff and invokes the Gods.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: We implore the great Gods of heaven to show us a sign that we may honor your divine will and be worthy of your blessing.
T: CUT TO:
N: Official White 117.
C: THE ZIGGURAT
D: The brick cart explodes through the scaffolding on the side of the ziggurat and sails into the air.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE ROYAL ENCLOSURE
D: Everybody turns at the sound of the crash and looks up at the ziggurat.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE BRICK PITS
D: The NASTY GUARD who whipped Oh earlier glances up and is instantly crushed by a ton of falling bricks.
C: THE ZIGGURAT
D: Zed is still descending as the broken scaffolding starts to give way.
C: TEMPLE SQUARE
D: The whole crowd watches in amazement as the 250 foot scaffolding slowly collapses and crashes to the ground, bringing tons of debris with it, sending up a great cloud of dust.
C: THE HIGH PRIEST
D: He looks shocked.
C: OH
D: He seizes the opportunity.
C: OH
D: A sign! It's a sign! The Chosen One comes! The other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his excitement.
N: Official White 118.
C: CROWD
D: The Chosen One! A sign from the Gods!
C: THE HIGH PRIEST
D: He doesn't quite know how to respond to the growing fervor of the crowd.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Yes! Well and truly, the Gods are with us-- The crowd drowns him out.
N: THE BASE OF THE ZIGGURAT A guard is standing there staring at the rubble of the scaffolding as Zed comes screaming down the side of the ziggurat and lands right on top of him. Zed quickly strips the unconscious guard of his weapons, starts to run off, stops, comes back and grabs the guard's helmet, then takes off running to the temple square.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE ALTAR
D: The High Priest is getting frantic now.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Burn them! Now! He grabs Maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth of the idol and the raging fire within. She struggles but is too drugged to put up much resistance. He grabs the sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her. HIGH PRIEST
E: cont'd
N: (RUSHING) May the balm of this healing oil soothe your journey through the sacred fire! (DESPERATELY) Don't fight it! It's the will of the Gods! Then, a voice from above. Official White 119. ZED (SHOUTS) I don't think so! Zed is standing atop the idol's head, brandishing a sword and shield.
C: MAYA
D: She sees him and starts to revive.
C: MAYA
D: Zed!
C: THE HIGH PRIEST
D: looks up, unable to hear Zed over the crowd noise.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: What did you say?
E: cupping his ear
N: ZED (SHOUTS) I said, 'I don't think so!'
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Still not getting it. Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the High Priest's way.
E: shakes his head
C: ZED
D: I Said, 'I don't think so.'
N: HIGH PRIEST (CONFUSED) You don't think what?
C: ZED
D: Whatever that last thing you said was.
N: HIGH PRIEST (THINKS) I forgot. (SHOUTS) Guards! Official White 120. Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows with his shield. Oh is inspired by Zed's courage.
C: OH
D: I know him, too. Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt.
E: to the Edomite slave
C: THE CROWD
D: Guards start moving to help their comrades, but the spirit of insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start grappling with the guards. A PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS comes double-timing into the square. Suddenly, A STOOPED OLD MAN throws off his cloak and pulls a sword. It's Abraham!
C: ABRAHAM
D: Death to the idolators! Abraham's small army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their weapons and attack the reinforcements. The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there observing the growing chaos.
C: ISAAC
D: Just fucking nuts.
E: shaking his head
C: MARLAK AND ENMEBARAGESI
D: They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike. Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground.
C: CAIN
D: Tough guy, huh? You want a piece of me? Get ready to have your head bashed in!
N: Official White 121. As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him. CAIN (cont'd) (nose bleeding, stunned) Nice move! He passes out and goes down.
C: THE KING
D: He starts to panic at the full-scale revolt and rises nervously. His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect him.
C: KING
D: I knew I could depend on your loyalty. The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in for the kill. KING
E: cont'd
N: (MUTTERS) Assholes. He falls to their flashing knives.
C: THE TEMPLE
D: Oh fights his way to the temple stairs, runs up and confronts a PRIEST who is trying to drag Eema away. He fights with very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming the guard and grabbing Eema.
C: OH
D: Hello, Eema.
E: suddenly shy again
C: EEMA
D: Oh? He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes.
E: still a little dazed
C: OH
D: Eema, you're my woman! You hear me?
E: suddenly forceful
C: EEMA
D: Okay.
N: Official White 122.
C: OH
D: Really? It's okay? He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform, accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.
C: THE HIGH PRIEST
D: While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya toward the fire. Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side. He holds the helpless Maya close to the flames.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: Keep away!
E: screaming and crying
C: ZED
D: Let her go.
C: HIGH PRIEST
D: No! The Gods demand a sacrifice! And you ruined it! He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire.
E: his mascara running
C: ZED
D: Why don't we just sacrifice something small-- a rabbit maybe. Or a duck. That'd be good, don't you think?
E: trying to keep him calm
N: HIGH PRIEST (SCREAMS) No! A duck would not be good!
C: OH
D: Then how about this? The High Priest turns to Oh. Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher. OH More oil?
E: U.S. cont'd
N: Official White 123. He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp. The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the mouth of the furnace. HIGH PRIEST (SCREAMS) Hot!
C: TEMPLE SQUARE
D: Everyone goes silent, stunned by the incredible turn of events. All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing before them on the center stage of the temple.
C: ZED AND OH
D: They look at each other. Someone has to say something. Finally, Zed clears his throat.
C: ZED
D: I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess, and on behalf of, well, the whole city, I want to thank the High Priest for his incredible sacrifice. That was really something, wasn't it? He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the people in the square are applauding. At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady rain starts to fall. The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied muttering begins. ZED People! Friends! Sodomites! Okay, that was a little confusing, wasn't it?
E: cont'd jumping in quickly
N: (MORE) Official White 124. ZED (cont'd) Was that a sign from God? Wasn't it a sign? What's the deal? We all want to know. But I'm not sure anybody really knows-- and I'd be real suspicious of people who say they do. If I've learned one thing, it's this: the world and everything in it is a miracle. And what that miracle means is for each and every one of us to figure out for himself. Are the Gods going to destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know-- I guess it's possible. But if we keep going the way we are, they won't have to. We're doing a pretty good job of destroying ourselves. So maybe we should all just go home now, and think about what happened-- and be very, very good to each other. I know I'm going to try. (raises his hand in salute to the people) Peace. The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear.
C: MARLAK
D: All hail the Chosen One! With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers. In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls.
C: ABRAHAM
D: What am I? Chopped liver? At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed.
C: MAYA
D: You're incredible, you know that?
C: ZED
D: That's what I've been trying to tell you. Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Official white 125.
S: EXT. GATES OF THE CITY - A FEW DAYS LATER
N: A caravan is assembling, making ready to leave the city. Marlak, Enmebaragesi, Maya, Eema and the other villagers are there, as well as a great number of freed slaves and Hebrews. Isaac is checking out Maya's breasts.
C: ISAAC
D: Hey, babe. Ever made it with a circumcised guy? Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife. ISAAC
E: cont'd
N: (BACKPEDALING) Is she with you? I did not realize that. Sorry. Marlak and Maya cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse. Marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard on the shoulder. MARLAK (GRUDGING) You did good. Zed waits for more, but nothing comes.
C: ZED
D: Well said, Marlak. You really have a way with words. They clasp hands.
E: rubbing his shoulder
C: MARLAK
D: We'll tell stories about you around the fire.
C: ZED
D: Not much to tell, is there? Just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire. No big deal. Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one is listening to him. Zed joins him. ZED Everybody ready?
E: cont'd
N: Official White 126. OH (WORRIED) Yeah, just about-- I guess so. The Hebrews are going to lead us to the sea and we can get boats from there. We can trade all this stuff everybody gave us for the trip home. (NERVOUS) I don't think I should be the leader. Nobody's listening to me.
C: EEMA
D: I'll listen to you. Oh swells up with pride.
E: by his side
C: OH
D: Come back to the village sometime. Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel. OH Hee-ya! Come on. People are watching. The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off. Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow. As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet. Maya joins him.
E: turns to Zed cont'd shouting at camel beat, quietly to camel
C: MAYA
D: Where will you go now?
C: ZED
D: Might head down to Egypt. I hear it's a happening kinda place.
C: MAYA
D: Are you going alone?
C: ZED
D: Not necessarily. You want to come?
N: Official White 127.
C: MAYA
D: I'll get my things. She gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions. MAYA The Princess gave me a few gifts when she freed us.
E: cont'd
C: ZED
D: Traveling light, huh? Okay, here we go.
N: (POINTS) To the west!
C: MAYA
D: That's west.
E: correcting him
C: ZED
D: I knew that. Just wanted to see if you did. Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the opposite direction. As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him.
C: CAIN
D: Peace--- brother. zed does a double take at the voice, shrugs, and walks off with Maya-- as a torrential rain begins to fall.
E: in a high unconvincing woman's voice
N: THE END
