S: EXT. GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads: "GARDEN CITY" CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small Arizona town of the late nineties. CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans and a mongrel dog. CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily. MED. SHOT line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera. LONG SHOT railway track with the three-car train approaching. MED. SHOT line of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door of the ticket office opens and the agent appears. FULL SHOT railway track. The train is now almost at the station.
S: EXT. PLATFORM - DAY
N: FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind Rocklin a conductor. MED. SHOT baggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors of the baggage car. MED. CLOSE SHOT on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's face. TRUCKING SHOT As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly.
C: STATION AGENT
D: Expectin' someone?
E: at office door
C: ROCKLIN
D: I guess not. Where's the stagecoach office?
E: after a second's pause
C: STATION AGENT
D: Back of the depot.
E: pointing
S: EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
N: The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a sign -- RED ROCK STAGE J. Harolday Proprietor Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally.
C: DAVE
D: Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- jus' lookit what you done -- I'm tellin' you, Blossom that -- -- makes you the most aggravatin' female as ever I had a despise fer -- I've got a good notion to pizen you -- an' what's more --
E: to horse some more pantomime indicating broken bottle
N: He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle.
C: DAVE
D: Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? -- Fooled myself, too.
E: to Blossom chuckles
N: ON ROCKLIN who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office.
S: INT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
N: PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble- lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks on the counter and leaves.
C: STAGE AGENT
D: Howdy.
E: to Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: That the stage for Santa Inez?
E: indicating stage
C: STAGE AGENT
D: Leaving any minute.
E: nods
N: Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts out the fare.
C: STAGE AGENT
D: Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty -- Name?
E: returning the balance
C: ROCKLIN
D: Rocklin.
N: The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances outside.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Mind if I ride alongside the driver?
C: STAGE AGENT
D: It's all right with me -- if it's all right with Dave -- He's mad -- His last trip -- Had a row with Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss.
E: over his specs
C: ROCKLIN
D: I like grumpy old cusses -- Hope to live long enough to be one.
E: soberly
C: STAGE AGENT
D: Yeah?
E: puzzled
N: He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand.
S: EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
N: The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of climbing up to the driver's seat.
C: STAGE AGENT
D: Here's your mail, Dave --
N: Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.
C: ROCKLIN
D: -- and a passenger.
E: as he steps up to the seat
N: Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down at him and asks rather wistfully --
C: ROCKLIN
D: Mind if I ride up here?
N: Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his pent-up wrath.
C: DAVE
D: Where's them wimmen?
C: STAGE AGENT
D: Up at the hotel.
C: DAVE
D: Why ain't they here? -- This is the stage depot, ain't it -- ? Ain't it?
E: yanking mail sack from Agent heaves sack into boot
C: STAGE AGENT
D: You can pick 'em up there -- it's only up the street --
C: DAVE
D: On'y up the street -- an' they cain't walk it -- What's the matter -- don't Easterners have laigs like other folks?
N: Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime stretches himself up toward Rocklin.
C: STAGE AGENT
D: Hold tight when you git in the mountains, mister -- When he gits riled you can hear the passengers prayin' for miles.
E: so Dave won't hear
N: Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously.
S: EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY
N: From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops.
C: DAVE
D: Whar's them wimmen? -- They waitin' for you to carry 'em out?
E: to handyman
N: Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime, an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow.
C: SADDLER
D: Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya?
E: as he comes to Dave
C: DAVE
D: I ain't tellin' that crazy female nothin' -- Last time I seen her she threatened to rip the hide off'n me and bat me dizzy with it.
E: getting to the ground
N: Dave goes to the rear of the coach.
C: SADDLER
D: Mister -- will you tell the Agent at Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet?
E: looks up to Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: I'll say that.
E: nods
N: PORCH OF HOTEL Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the older woman.
C: CLERK
D: By next year, madam, we expect to have a bathtub on each floor.
E: as group comes through door
N: Miss Martin stops short and looks o.s. ON DAVE AT REAR OF THE COUCH having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot. Miss Martin and the others come into the scene.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Now don't drop it --
N: Dave pauses to see who is talking.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: At your age you'd best not be lifting things so heavy.
C: DAVE
D: Mebbe you're young enough to hoist her up your own self.
E: grimaces tries to lift trunk again
N: CLOSE SHOT on Clara. She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin. CLOSE SHOT on Rocklin. He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave. Now he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment. FULL SHOT Dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it. Miss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring up at Rocklin.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Clara!
N: Clara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt. The Clerk steps to the side of the coach and opens the door. He assists Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin.
S: INT. COACH - DAY
N: Miss Martin and Clara. Miss Martin is just sitting. She looks coldly at Clara.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Staring as though you'd never seen a man before.
E: in low voice
S: EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY
N: Dave, Rocklin and Clerk. Dave is at the moment climbing to his seat on the other side of the coach. The Clerk swings the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or less confidentially.
C: CLERK
D: Try to hold him down or he'll scare the women to death.
N: ON ROCKLIN He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually, but loud enough to be heard by the women.
C: ROCKLIN
D: I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman.
S: INT. COACH - DAY
N: THROUGH window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara. The women have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark. Miss Martin smiles vindictively at Clara, who flushes. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the Clerk, who moves to the coach door.
C: CLERK
D: Well, I hope you have a nice trip, ladies.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: I hope we get there -- wouldn't surprise me if we didn't.
S: EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY
N: On Dave and Rocklin.
C: DAVE
D: Wait till I get you on the road, you old buzzard, you'll be surprised all right.
E: mutters
N: He takes up the reins and shouts the team away.
T: DISSOLVE OUT DISSOLVE IN
S: EXT. ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY
N: EXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in the same direction as the coach.
S: EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT OF COACH - DAY
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach, Dave steals a look at his companion.
C: DAVE
D: I wonder why a young feller who don't have to wants to come into this God danged country?
N: Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead. Dave glances down toward the women.
C: DAVE
D: Say -- did you mean what you said back there about wimmen?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Every word of it.
E: grimly
C: DAVE
D: Then you're smarter than most.
E: chuckling
C: ROCKLIN
D: Maybe I seen more of 'em than most.
C: DAVE
D: Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be a leetle bit surprised. All the same...
E: looking at him admiringly reflectively
N: He breaks off and chuckles again.
C: ROCKLIN
D: All the same -- what?
E: unsmilingly
N: Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail.
C: DAVE
D: Take a slug.
E: offering bottle to Rocklin
N: Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all but empties it in one pull.
C: DAVE
D: Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how much alike they are? Both fool you, but you never figger out how to do without 'em.
E: holding up the bottle and squinting through it
N: Rocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again.
C: DAVE
D: Take another.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Not just yet.
C: DAVE
D: Well... Here's to her.
E: unoffended putting the bottle to his lips
C: ROCKLIN
D: Who?
C: DAVE
D: The next one that fools you.
N: He empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time, the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over and looks down o.s.
S: INT. COACH - DAY
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Clara and Miss Martin. The former is showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is hanging on grimly.
S: EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT - DAY
N: Dave straightens up, grinning.
C: DAVE
D: Mighty rough stretch along here.
E: with relish
N: He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little unsteadily in his seat.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Like me to speel you a while?
C: DAVE
D: Nope. I've had a few snorts but that don't make no difference. Leas'ways, never has... Don't ever git wore out, and useless, like me.
E: after a second's pause
C: ROCKLIN
D: Who're them as say you are?
C: DAVE
D: Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly- aching. Reckon he's entitled to his opinion. But him and me never did see eye to eye.
C: ROCKLIN
D: What's wrong?
C: DAVE
D: It's constitootional, I reckon. Like that step-daughter of his is crazy -- he's too sane. Believes In law and order.
C: ROCKLIN
D: What's wrong with law and order?
E: grinning
C: DAVE
D: Depends on who's a-dishin' it out. Never was good at takin' orders meself. As for the law -- well, you'll soon find out what that means 'round these parts.
N: The coach hits a particularly bad bit of road and there is an exclamation from inside. Dave grins and urges the team on cheerfully.
T: DISSOLVE OUT DISSOLVE IN
S: EXT. RIM - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY
N: FULL SHOT -- as Dave pulls up the stage at the top of a long downgrade and looks out appreciatively at the view. From this crest of the rim, a vast expanse of country is visible. CLOSE SHOT stage. Miss Martin thrusts her head out of the window.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Driver? Driver, what's the matter?
C: DAVE
D: Nothin'. Restin' hosses. Git out and stretch yore laigs if you want.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Resting horses? What for? I can see with my own eyes it's downhill.
N: Dave brightens visibly at this challenge.
C: DAVE
D: You in such an all-fired hurry, lady?
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Certainly, we are in a hurry.
C: DAVE
D: Well -- we'll hurry some.
E: beaming
N: His whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the grade. LONG SHOT grade, with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the narrow road and around the sharp bends. CLOSE FULL SHOT Dave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill. Dave is leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from within. None come. Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and mildly amused.
S: INT. STAGECOACH - DAY
N: The two women are really being scrambled.
S: EXT. STAGECOACH - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY
N: CLOSE TWO SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin. Rocklin is as calm as if he were walking. Dave is more and more pleased with himself. He again leans out to listen. LONG SHOT grade, with coach approaching in b.g. In f.g. the road narrows and makes a sharp turn at the very edge of a precipice. There is no possible way of getting the coach safely around this turn except at a walk. LONG SHOT road, from point of view of driver's seat, establishing the same menace ahead. CLOSE TWO SHOT Dave and Rocklin, as Rocklin glances out of the corner of his eyes as if wondering whether or not Dave is too drunk to perceive the disaster. He makes no move, however, to advise or interfere. FULL SHOT road; at danger corner, as stage comes in. At the very last second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in safety. CLOSE SHOT stage. Dave grins at Rocklin, then listens for the outcry he expects from the women within. The old lady's head bobs out of the window.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Now what's the matter. Why are we stopping again?
E: fiercely
N: Old Dave's mouth drops open, and as Rocklin begins to grin at his discomfiture.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY
N: FULL SHOT of lonely adobe which serves as a combination roadhouse, stage station and bar. As the coach rolls into f.g., a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the horses.
C: PABLO
D: Buenas noches, senor.
E: as Rocklin swings down
C: ROCKLIN
D: Buenas noches, amigo.
C: PABLO
D: Ha llegado anticipademente, senor.
E: grinning at the friendly tone
C: ROCKLIN
D: Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado.
N: He glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily and Pablo bursts out laughing. MED. CLOSE SHOT on door of coach. As Dave comes into shot, Miss Martin's head pops out of the window.
C: DAVE
D: We stop here.
E: gruffly
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Why do we stop here?
C: DAVE
D: If you wanta eat and stretch yore laigs.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Will you please stop referring to my legs!
C: DAVE
D: You got some, ain't you?
N: He turns and lurches toward the roadhouse.
S: INT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY
N: FULL SHOT from doorway. It is a large barn-like room on one side of which is a bar. On the other side is a fireplace and a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and reveals a face even hairier than Dave's.
C: ZEKE
D: Dave!
E: holding out his arms
C: DAVE
D: Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot!
E: letting out a yell and rushing to Zeke
N: CLOSE SHOT Zeke and Dave as they beat one another on the back.
C: DAVE
D: Whar you been all these months?
C: ZEKE
D: Up in the hills workin' my way down the biggest hole you ever seed.
C: DAVE
D: Good -- What's at the bottom of it?
C: ZEKE
D: Nothin'!
C: DAVE
D: What, again!!
E: roaring with laughter
N: MED. SHOT Rocklin has entered and moved to the fire. Miss Martin and Clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at the bar. A pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking man of about 45 (Stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them ingratiatingly.
C: STAN
D: Good evening, ladies. How about something to eat?
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Well -- if it won't take too long.
E: with a dubious look toward the pair at the bar
C: STAN
D: This way, ladies.
E: leading the way toward the partition
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT bar. Dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of "She Was Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage" to an old-type phonograph.
C: DAVE
D: Yep -- this is my last trip.
C: ZEKE
D: Why?
C: DAVE
D: Old Harolday won't take back what he said.
C: ZEKE
D: What'd he say?
C: DAVE
D: "You're fired."
N: They both yell with laughter and slap one another on the back. MED. SHOT from fireplace. Rocklin is standing in f.g. looking down at the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket dip. Seated at the table are Clara and Miss Martin. From o.s. comes the sound of Zeke and Dave singing to the phonograph record. Miss Martin glares indignantly in the direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest. At this moment Stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in his hand which he dumps on the table.
C: STAN
D: There you are, folks. Dig in and help y'rselves.
N: Miss Martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish of meat and freezes. CLOSE SHOT dish of meat. It is swimming in greasy brown gravy. MED. SHOT Miss Martin as she shudders dyspeptically and closes her eyes. MED. CLOSE SHOT bar, as Stan comes from the table to Dave and Zeke.
C: STAN
D: Supper, Dave?
C: DAVE
D: I'm drinkin' mine. Set 'em up.
E: noisily
N: MED. SHOT table. Clara has filled a plate with food, which she offers to her aunt.
C: CLARA
D: Auntie --
C: MISS MARTIN
D: With my dyspepsia? Do you want to kill me?
N: Clara hesitates for a second, then looks across to Rocklin.
C: CLARA
D: Aren't you going to have any supper?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Reckon so.
N: He comes to table and begins to help himself. There is a loud burst of laughter from the bar.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Young man, that driver's had all the liquor he can take.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Has he?
C: MISS MARTIN
D: You know he has. You're not a complete fool, are you?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Frequently.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: The rudeness of people in these parts is appalling!
E: to Clara, furiously
N: Clara looks apologetically at Rocklin, then away again nervously. Suddenly, she sees something o.s. and drops her knife and fork with a little start. MED. CLOSE SHOT window. A thin, unpleasant-looking face is seen through the glass. The windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower part of the face into a hideous smile. It is the younger of the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel. PANNING SHOT on kitchen door as Stan comes through with a dish of potatoes. A man's voice is heard o.s. and he pulls up abruptly.
C: BOB CLEWS' VOICE
D: Well, well -- smells like a mighty nice bit of veal.
N: CAMERA HAS PANNED TO include the side door next to the window and almost opposite to the dining table. The owner of the face at the window (Bob Clews) is now standing in the doorway. Behind him is the man with the sheriff's badge on his dirty vest (Jackson). As they come forward toward Stan, the latter shows obvious signs of nervousness.
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Doin' yourself well these days, Stan.
C: STAN
D: A friend of mine was by an' sold me a quarter of beef.
C: JACKSON
D: The same friend as sold you that hide Bob, here, found stashed in your barn yesterday?
E: insinuatingly
C: STAN
D: Hide -- What hide?
C: BOB CLEWS
D: The one that might send you to the penitentiary.
C: JACKSON
D: What did you do with it, Stan?
E: smugly
C: STAN
D: I never had no hide stashed --
C: BOB CLEWS
D: I saw it yesterday under the hay.
E: harshly
C: STAN
D: Then it must still be there.
C: JACKSON
D: No it ain't -- we looked -- Where is it?
C: STAN
D: I tell ya --
C: MISS MARTIN
D: What is all this?
E: who has been an interested witness
N: Jackson, as though noticing the women for the first time, raises his hat.
C: JACKSON
D: Afternoon ma'am. Miz Caldwell ain't it?
C: MISS MARTIN
D: No -- Martin -- Miss Martin -- This is Miss Caldwell.
C: JACKSON
D: Glad to know you, miss -- Been expectin' you at Santa Inez. I'm Sheriff Jackson. Any relation of Red Caldwell's a friend of mine.
E: to Clara
C: BOB CLEWS
D: You're sure gonna brighten things up considerable around the K.C. Ranch.
E: that oily smile
N: Miss Martin gives Clews an icy stare and snaps her eyes to Jackson.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: What's going on with him?
E: indicating Stan
C: JACKSON
D: Just a little matter of the law.
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Rustlin'.
E: hastily
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Wrestling?
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Rustlin' -- cattle stealin'.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Oh -- a thief --
C: STAN
D: I tell ya I never --
E: visibly worried
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Save it --
E: quickly
C: JACKSON
D: Matter of fact -- Bob, here, says that the hide he saw yesterday had the K.C. brand on it.
E: to Miss Martin
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Oh -- hmmm -- well, what do you intend doing about it?
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Law's pretty harsh 'round here on cattle thieves.
E: looking at Stan
C: JACKSON
D: Course, we don't want to make a mistake with an old-timer, but --
E: being the kind man
N: Rocklin speaks from where he leans against the wall, casually smoking.
C: ROCKLIN
D: How about the owner of that beef -- mightn't he have somethin' to say about it?
N: There's a pause in which all have turned their attention to Rocklin.
C: JACKSON
D: Meanin'?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Red Caldwell -- he's the owner of the K.C., ain't he?
C: BOB CLEWS
D: You're 'way behind the herd, mister -- Red Caldwell died three weeks ago.
E: after a short chuckle
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Was murdered, you mean.
E: glaring at Clews
C: JACKSON
D: That's right -- shot in the back -- not far from here.
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Maybe he was gettin' on to things about the cattle that's been missin' from the K.C. lately.
E: significantly to Stan
C: STAN
D: I tell ya I ain't never had any hide --
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Well, you got beef --
E: quickly
C: STAN
D: Yes -- an' I got a bill of sale fer it, too.
E: meekly defiant
N: Jackson and Clews exchange a quick glance.
C: JACKSON
D: S'pose you let me see that bill of sale.
C: STAN
D: It's right out here.
E: starts for kitchen
N: Jackson follows, looking at the women.
C: JACKSON
D: Like I said -- I wouldn't want to make a mistake with an ole-timer.
N: Jackson follows Stan into the kitchen. Clews moves to the fire and lunges there picking his teeth and eyeing Clara, who stirs uneasily under the man's gaze. MED. SHOT as Rocklin comes out of the thoughtful mood in which he has been plunged by the information about Red Caldwell and notes the by-play between Clews and Clara. He frowns and makes a movement as if about to rise. At the same time, Dave and Zeke, whose voices have been heard throughout In the b.g., stagger into the shot.
C: DAVE
D: See that one? She ain't got no laigs.
E: chuckling and pointing to Miss Martin confidentially
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Hold your tongue. And you -- stop staring as if we were monsters.
E: to Zeke, who is gaping at her
N: Zeke takes it and staggers into the b.g. near Bob Clews.
C: DAVE
D: Where's Stan? We got to have another drink.
E: to Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: He's outside tryin' to explain away a hide.
C: DAVE
D: Eh?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Seems we're eatin' stolen beef.
E: indicating food
C: DAVE
D: Somebody's loco. Stan might have given house-room to bit o' dead beef, but he'd never be fool enough to leave the hide lyin' around. How 'bout it, Zeke?
E: to Zeke
N: Zeke opens his mouth to speak, and slowly folds up, sliding down the wall to the floor. MED. SHOT as Clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group.
C: BOB CLEWS
D: That's the way it is, Dave.
N: Dave has gone to Zeke's aid and now peers at Clews closely, recognizing him for the first time.
C: DAVE
D: Oh -- it's you.
E: disgustedly
C: BOB CLEWS
D: That's right -- your old pal Bob Clews.
C: DAVE
D: Git away from me -- you two-timin' horse thief.
E: shoves Clews
C: BOB CLEWS

N: Rocklin, FROM Garvey's ANGLE as he leaves the Sun-Up and starts toward the Judge's office.
S: EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Garvey and Clint, at the window. From their expressions it is apparent that anxious words are passing between them, and now Clint suddenly drops from sight. ROCKLIN APPROACHES - LOOKS THE PLACE OVER - AND ENTERS
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
N: ON Arly and Juan, mounted. They see Rocklin going into Garvey's place.
S: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: MED. SHOT -- TOWARD door, with Garvey at desk in f.g. The door opens and Rocklin enters.
C: GARVEY
D: Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right in.
E: effusively
N: Rocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to the desk.
C: ROCKLIN
D: I understand you were Red Caldwell's lawyer?
C: GARVEY
D: I was.
E: immediately on guard
C: ROCKLIN
D: Know anything about this?
N: He takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey. The latter takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. He looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again. Then reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read. LETTER -- It reads: Dear Mr. Rocklin: Glad you have made up your mind to take the job. Enclosed find train fare and $150 advance on wages. Yours faithfully, J. Caldwell MED. SHOT Rocklin and Garvey. The latter looks up from the letter completely bewildered.
C: GARVEY
D: I don't understand. Job? What job?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Foreman.
C: GARVEY
D: On the "K.C."? But -- but why should he want you?
E: gaping trying to take it in
C: ROCKLIN
D: Why not? Good foremen don't grow on bushes.
N: There is a little pause, with Garvey still bewildered.
C: GARVEY
D: Is that your only motive for coming here?
E: thinking hard
C: ROCKLIN
D: What other motive could I have?
C: GARVEY
D: I don't know -- It's just that Red Caldwell was a peculiar man -- had a funny way of doing things.
N: He studies Rocklin a short moment, then sits back comfortably and relieved.
C: GARVEY
D: Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Rocklin, that you've been brought all this way on a fool's errand, but -- I'm afraid the deal's off.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Off?
C: GARVEY
D: I don't want to be too hard on you, but as executor of the estate I have to consider the interests of the new owner. How about, say, a hundred in full settlement?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Well --
E: thoughtfully
N: There is a knock on the door. Garvey rises and speaks on his way to the door.
C: GARVEY
D: That's my last word -- think it over.
N: Garvey opens the door, and Miss Martin stalks in followed by Clare.
C: GARVEY
D: How do you do, ladies --
E: graciously
C: MISS MARTIN
D: You are Judge Garvey, I presume.
E: icily
C: GARVEY
D: Yes -- and you are --
E: nods
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Miss Martin -- and my niece, Clara Caldwell.
C: GARVEY
D: Of course -- of course --
E: reaching for a chair
N: Miss Martin sits stiffly as she eyes Rocklin coldly.
C: GARVEY
D: You came at a very opportune moment, madam. This gentleman claims to have some sort of a letter from the late Mr. Caldwell, engaging him as foreman of the "K.C."
C: MISS MARTIN
D: What!
C: ROCKLIN
D: What do you mean -- claims to have? -- You saw it, didn't you?
E: to Garvey
C: MISS MARTIN
D: You can't hold us to account for every promise made by that man. Everyone knows he wasn't responsible for his actions half the time. And if you think I'd have you as a foreman --
E: before Garvey can answer
C: ROCKLIN
D: Listen, lady -- I'd rather walk for somebody else, than ride for you.
E: finds it hard to control himself
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Well -- the impudence --
E: taken aback
C: ROCKLIN
D: All I come for this morning was to pay beck the hundred and fifty Red Caldwell sent in advance.
C: CLARA
D: Oh, no
N: They all turn and stare at her.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Don't interfere, Clara. Of course he must pay it back.
C: ROCKLIN
D: The railway fare -- well, I reckon we can check that up against the time lost and call it quits.
E: throws down a roll of bills in front of Garvey
C: CLARA
D: But, Mr. -- er -- I don't know your name...
E: summoning up her courage
C: ROCKLIN
D: Rocklin, miss.
E: raising his hat
C: CLARA
D: Mr. Rocklin, it isn't fair for you to pay anything back.
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's how I'd prefer it, If you don't mind, miss -- never did care fer owing favors to no one -- especially women.
C: CLARA
D: Oh!
E: as if she had been struck
N: The sound of rapid steps approaching from outside is heard and they all look toward the door. MED. SHOT on door, as it opens to admit Arly. Ignoring everyone in the room except Garvey, she comes abruptly to the desk, with the riding quirt dangling from her wrist.
C: ARLY
D: I've just heard they let George Clews out of penitentiary and that he's headed this way. You might tell him from me, if he sets foot on the Santee Ranch, I'll shoot him on sight.
C: GARVEY
D: But really, Miss Arly, why should you deliver your message through me?
C: ARLY
D: You have mutual friends.
C: GARVEY
D: If you're referring to Sheriff Jackson...
C: ARLY
D: I am.
C: GARVEY
D: But that's absurd. The fact that he employs one of the Clews brothers doesn't make the other his friend.
C: ARLY
D: Have it your own way; but it'd be fair to warn him, because I mean it.
E: contemptuously
N: For the first time, she appears to be conscious of the presence of the other women.
C: GARVEY
D: Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss Harolday -- Miss Martin, Miss Caldwell's aunt. You should know one another, seeing you'll be neighbors. Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch for her stepfather. She's a famous -- ah -- horsewoman in these parts.
E: hastening to change the conversation
C: CLARA
D: I know. I saw you ride into town this morning. You looked lovely. Just what I'd like to be.
E: with ingenuous enthusiasm
N: Arly stares at her unbelievingly for a second.
C: ARLY
D: Yes?
E: slowly, a bit flustered
N: She looks slowly from Clara to Rocklin, as if suspecting collusion.
C: CLARA
D: Oh, this is Mr. Rocklin. He drove us in from Garden City last night. He...
E: completely innocent
C: ROCKLIN
D: I already met Miss Harolday.
E: dead pan
C: CLARA
D: Oh.
C: ARLY
D: I've a message for you -- from Harolday.
E: stonily, to Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: What, again?
E: murmuring
C: ARLY
D: He wants you to come down to the office.
C: ROCKLIN
D: What for?
C: ARLY
D: He's got a proposition to make -- about riding for him. Sixty a month.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Hmmm -- That's a foreman's wages.
C: ARLY
D: I wouldn't offer you a red cent. But it's his money. And the way things are shaping, maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch.
E: suddenly exploding controlling herself bitingly
C: MISS MARTIN
D: I warn you, you're making a great mistake. This man is no good.
E: pushing her way forward
C: CLARA
D: Auntie!
C: ARLY
D: Well? D'you want the job?
E: to Rocklin ignoring Miss Martin
N: CLOSE SHOT Rocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression. Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Lead the way.
E: indicating the door
N: MED. SHOT as Arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she came. Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his hat and follows. As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him.
C: CLARA
D: Auntie, why did you have to say that? I simply don't understand you...
E: after they have gone
C: MISS MARTIN
D: But I understand you. I'd be ashamed of myself. Throwing myself at a man like that.
E: cutting in, grimly scathingly
C: CLARA I... I...
D: Oh, you're horrid -- horrid. I wish I'd never come.
E: suddenly bursting into tears
N: She turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window. CAMERA PANS TO HOLD A CLOSE TWO SHOT of Garvey and Miss Martin.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: You must excuse her. She's young.
C: GARVEY
D: And inexperienced.
N: Garvey leans back in his chair and smiles.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: And young people must be protected from themselves at times -- don't you agree?
E: significantly
N: Miss Martin throws him a quick look, which he returns steadily.
C: GARVEY
D: Exactly.
E: at last, with a grim echo of a smile
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
N: Arly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from Harolday's office. Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is following a few paces behind them. He rides his horse and is leading Arly's.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Does he always follow you?
E: to Arly, indicating Julio
C: ARLY
D: He's not following me -- he's with me -- he's always with me.
E: defiantly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Oh -- just an old Indian friend.
E: takes it mildly
C: ARLY
D: The best friend I've got.
E: straight at him
N: Rocklin nods, looks back again at Julio, then back to Arly as they go out of shot.
S: INT. SANTA INEZ STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY
N: PAINING SHOT -- as Arly comes to from the street, followed by Julio and Rocklin.
C: ARLY
D: Wait here.
E: abruptly to Rocklin
N: CAMERA PANS her over to a door marked "PRIVATE," which she opens without knocking.
S: INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
N: MED. SHOT as Arly comes through from the outer office toward Harolday, who is seated at desk in f.g. At Arly's abrupt entrance, he looks up, startled.
C: ARLY
D: I've just hired a man named Rocklin and said you made me do it. Sixty dollars and he 'll earn it -- while he lasts.
N: There is a little pause. Harolday's face is completely dead pan. He looks out of the window for a second, then back at Arly.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Why did you do it, Arly?
E: quietly
C: ARLY
D: So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint and he quarrelled last night. Clint lied about it and I made a fool of myself. He's outside now.
E: nodding toward the outer office
C: HAROLDAY
D: All right. Send him in.
E: with a little sigh
N: Arly goes to the door and opens it.
C: ARLY
D: Come in.
E: calling
N: Rocklin comes in and Arly exits without a word, closing the door behind her. REVERSE SHOT as Rocklin comes from the doorway into f.g. of shot, facing Harolday, who is seated on the far side of the desk.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Mr. Rocklin, what happened between you and my son last night?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Poker.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Hmmm. About this suggestion of you working for me.
C: ROCKLIN
D: It's your suggestion, not mine.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Ye-es. Sixty dollars is big money.
C: ROCKLIN
D: If you've changed your mind...
E: turning to go
C: HAROLDAY
D: No, no.... Wait a minute. I take it you've had the experience.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me as foreman.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Oh -- had Caldwell hired you?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Yeah -- but I won't ride for the new owners -- so that leaves me open.
C: HAROLDAY
D: I see -- Were you a friend of Red's?
C: ROCKLIN
D: No -- I guess he just heard about me.
N: A sudden clatter of feet is heard and all eyes turn toward the door. MED. SHOT as Dave, followed by Arly and Juan, bursts in. His eyes go around the room quickly until he finds Rocklin.
C: DAVE
D: George Clews is in town. He's seen what you done to Bob and he's a- lookin' for you.
E: as excited as a schoolboy
N: They all look quickly toward the window.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
N: LONG SHOT -- from stagecoach office window. The center of the street is clear and men's heads are peering from doorways.
S: INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
N: MED. SHOT -- group at window, looking into street.
C: HAROLDAY
D: The street is clear.
N: Dave turns and looks curiously at Rocklin, who frowns impatiently.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Tell him I'll be out in the street in front of the saloon.
E: to Dave irritably
C: DAVE
D: Uh-huh!
E: dashing out, radiant
S: INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, and speaks his thought to Bob.
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: I'm gonna get his ears.
N: Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and halts with the swinging doors half open.
C: DAVE
D: Hi you, George Clews --
E: loudly
N: George Clews turns.
C: DAVE
D: Rocklin says if you don't come out, he'll come in here after you, an' tear you apart.
N: George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.
C: SHORTY
D: That was my beer, you know.
E: taps Clews
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: If he comes in again -- I'll throw you.
E: nastily
N: Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun in sight.
C: CAP
D: That does it, boys -- you know where the door is.
E: to the Clews
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: Com-mon -- I'll get his ears.
E: to Bob
C: CAP
D: Not until I get my money --
N: George and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar. They have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun.
C: CAP
D: There's three drinks and a broken beer glass.
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: Pay 'im.
E: to Bob, after a second's deliberation
N: George turns and starts for the doors as Bob comes back to the bar to settle up.
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: I'll get his ears.
N: ON PAP FOSSLER AND THE OTHERS AT WINDOW - AS GEORGE CLEWS BURSTS OUT THROUGH THE DOORS
C: PAP
D: That Rocklin'll kill him for sure.
E: quietly
C: CUSTOMER
D: Le's hope.
S: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: As George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking close by, evidently recognizes him and tails it away, leaving George blinking at him. LONG SHOT Rocklin -- FROM George's ANGLE. He is walking slowly forward down the middle of the street. MED. SHOT George, looking baffled by the steady approach.
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: I'm coming -- and you'd better run!
E: yelling
N: He steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then stands still again. CLOSE SHOT Rocklin -- CAMERA MOVING WITH him as he comes slowly and steadily forward. CLOSE SHOT George. His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has too much sense to draw too soon.
S: EXT. STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY
N: MED. SHOT -- Harolday watching from behind the window of his office. Behind Harolday are Julio and Arly. The latter makes a step as if about to move to the door, but Julio restrains her.
S: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- as Garvey, Miss Martin and Clara watch the scene below -- Garvey and Miss Martin excitedly and Clara in great distress.
S: EXT. HOTEL - DAY
N: CLOSER SHOT -- men in hotel doorway, taut with excitement. FULL SHOT Rocklin -- SHOOTING PAST George, whose hands are on his gun butts. Rocklin's thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Draw a gun and I'll kill you.
E: quietly
N: MED. SHOT George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole- axed steer.
S: INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window. Arly gives an involuntary exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by Juan. Harolday continues to stare frowningly out of the window.
S: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window, with Garvey obviously disapponted, Miss Martin bridling and Clara showing obvious relief.
S: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: MED. SHOT -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him offering congratulations. Dave pushes his way through the crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and Jackson comes into shot.
C: JACKSON
D: Hey, you! What's this you been up to?
E: to Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: I just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours -- same as you did over Dave's here yesterday.
C: DAVE
D: Eh?
E: surprised
C: JACKSON
D: I don't know what you're talking about.
E: blustering
C: ROCKLIN
D: You're a liar!
E: calmly
N: He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside blusteringly.
C: JACKSON
D: Now you lookee here, young feller. You go on talking that way and you'll find yourself in trouble.
N: The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a final shout to Rocklin.
C: JACKSON
D: Don't say you ain't been warned.
N: Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street. MED. SHOT as Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move off.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: I saw you. I saw you strike that poor man.
E: ignoring everyone but Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: You ruffian, you!
N: Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Let me go! I knew the sort you were the moment I set eyes on you. You can't fool me! You're nothing but a common adventurer! Come, Clara!
E: to Rocklin
N: She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same grim look, enters Harolday's office.
S: INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Harolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door, having seen Rocklin approaching. The door opens and Rocklin enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly interrupted.
C: ROCKLIN
D: -- Now what was that you were sayin' about Caldwell?
C: HAROLDAY
D: You being hired by Red Caldwell only confirms what I'd suspected -- he was getting ready to fight.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Fight? Who?
E: trying to get information
C: HAROLDAY
D: Organized rustling. Well at least -- that's my belief. Red was no friend of mine. Too fond of taking the law into his own hands. But he had my sympathy. He'd been harder hit than any of us. And on top of it all, he lost his foreman.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You mean, he quit on him?
C: HAROLDAY
D: He was shot -- in the back -- with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got Red.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Got any ideas?
C: HAROLDAY
D: No -- Except that the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere. Pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance.
E: bitterly
N: Rocklin realizes that maybe Harolday is trying to throw a curve -- trying to get him to talk.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Say -- it don't sound as if it's goin' to be too easy for them wimmen at the K.C.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Want to go back and work for them?
E: watching him keenly
C: ROCKLIN
D: No, sir. And I ain't jumping at this offer o' yours either because I don't hold with working for wimmen.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well don't worry. She won't interfere with you...Rocklin -- I figure we've been losin' cattle over a place called Table Top -- it's the back way into the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route for rustlers -- I'm going to send you up to the line camp -- you don't mind working a lone hand -- do you?
E: quickly
C: ROCKLIN
D: -- I like workin' that way.
E: measuring

D: Good -- be ready to move out this afternoon.

E: in his best sales talk
N: During Dave's speech Rocklin has come from the Sun-up carrying his valise. He pauses a moment, looking around. Dave sees him.
C: DAVE
D: 'scuse me, Pap -- Be right back to find out when I start.
N: He hurries across the street toward Rocklin.

C: DAVE
D: What! -- Have you gone plumb loco?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Good money -- sixty a month
C: DAVE
D: There ain't enough money in this town to make it worth your while to work for that gal.
N: Rocklin gives Dave a quizzical look, which Dave mistakes for weakening.
C: DAVE
D: When she gits goin' she can be meaner'n a skillet full o' snakes. She ain't goin' to forget the way you made a fool of her today -- in front of the whole town.

E: O.S.
C: DAVE
D: Be right with you. It's pizen that's what it is -- jus' plain --- What you want to hang around this town for anyways? --
E: to Rocklin
N: Dave and Rocklin have reached middle of the street. Pap Fossler's voice comes again from o.s.
C: PAP FOSSLER'S VOICE
D: Hey, Dave.
N: Dave reacts with a squint in Pap's direction. He runs out toward Pap, but would rather stay with Rocklin. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Rocklin ACROSS the street To the stage office, where see Arly and Tala sitting on their horses apparently waiting for Rocklin. A third horse is standing by with Rocklin's saddle on it. Rocklin, upon reaching the front of the stage office, pauses a moment, to look over the horse carrying his saddle -- glances up to Arly.

CAMERA PANS to show a buggy on the road ahead, approaching a wooded dell where the road divides. MED. CLOSE SHOT of the buggy, showing Miss Martin riding in front, beside Shorty Davis, who is driving, and Clara with her back to the driver, facing the oncoming trio. Miss Martin hears the sound of the approaching horses, and looks over her shoulder. MED. SHOT Arly, Juan and Rocklin, with Miss Martin in F.g. The latter scowls and looks quickly to her front as the riders draw level with the buggy, Rocklin coining to the right, alongside Clara.

They are looking back towards the buggy which has taken the lower road to the right of the copse. REVERSE SHOT with Arly and Juan in f.g. and the buggy in the distance. Rocklin raises his hat to the women in the buggy and canters back to Arly, who has been watching with a peculiar expression.
C: ARLY
D: I thought maybe you'd changed your mind again.
E: coldly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Nope.
E: cheerfully
N: She looks at him angrily for a second as if about to say something sarcastic. Then, repressing herself, she wheels her horse and canters off along the side of the copse. Rocklin throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with an enigmatic expression. He returns Rocklin's look with a stern, menacing frown. Then, with a gentle flick of the rein, he urges his horse after Arly. Completely baffled, Rocklin scratches his head for a second, then follows.

D: Senor Romerez, it appears that you do not like me.
E: challenging, but perfectly friendly
N: For a second Juan does not reply. Then, as he speaks, he takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket. Rocklin, his mind on other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch, but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's head of hammered silver.
C: JUAN
D: Senor, that is true. I do not like you.
E: during the above business
C: ROCKLIN
D: Why?
C: JUAN
D: Permit that I offer you a cigarette.
E: extending the pouch
N: Rocklin shakes his head. Juan, having spilled tobacco in a paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own.
C: JUAN
D: It is not your fault that your shadow is black. But you will only bring unhappiness to my senorita. I do not blame you, but I fear I must hate you.
N: He turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse; then looks down from the saddle.
C: JUAN
D: Adios, Senor.
N: He rides quickly out of the shot.

N: MED. SHOT -- as Rocklin forces his horse up the last few feet of the steep trail at the top of the canyon, and pulls up at the top of the rise with a look of amazement. FULL SHOT - FROM ROCKLIN'S ANGLE A rich meadow stretches ahead with a stream running through it, and a cabin at the far end. Steep escarpments surround the lush meadow land, making an idyllic scene. As Rocklin comes slowly into shot with the same look of startled appreciation on his face and begins to move toward the cabin,

S: EXT. APPROACH TO SANTEE RANCH - DAY
N: LONG SHOT -- of Juan, as he canters across open country toward the ranch. CAMERA PANS to include the road from Santa Inez along which approaches a smallish freight wagon, pulled by two horses. As the driver sees Juan and waves his whip, the Mexican swerves from his course and canters toward the wagon. MED. SHOT wagon, which we now see is being driven by Dave. On the side of the wagon is written: TRANSPORT & GENERAL FREIGHTAGE -- Pap Fossler and Sons. Juan canters into shot and pulls up alongside the wagon.
C: DAVE
D: Hiya there.
C: JUAN
D: Buenos dias, Senor Dave. You have found new employer, eh?
E: looking at name on wagon
C: DAVE
D: Yeah. Haulin' freight for ole Pap Fossler. Got a letter here for that crazy galoot, Rocklin. From the little Caldwell girl. Seems mighty took up about sumpin'. Made me promise to deliver it personal.

S: EXT. TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY
N: Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for someone. Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder.
C: CLINT
D: Have you seen Arly?
E: turning to Shelley
C: SHELLEY
D: No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly today, but Ah seed her las' night, and she shore was mad.
N: To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a whistle.
C: SHELLEY
D: Plenty mad!
N: Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that- be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s. ANGLE From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall quickly away from the flower. ARLY As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life and resumes sweeping -- but furiously. Clint regards the girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.
C: CLINT
D: 'Mornin', Arly --
E: not too definitely
N: Arly is coming toward Clint.
C: ARLY
D: 'Mornin', Clint.
E: pleasantly
N: She steps close to Clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her jacket lying on the ground near the step.
C: CLINT
D: You must be feeling pretty good.
E: as Arly leans down to pick up the jacket
N: Arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile. She turns now and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when Clint comes to her side.
S: ARLY AND CLINT WALKING
C: CLINT
D: Say, Arly -- about that poker game, night before last, I ---
E: as he joins Arly
C: ARLY
D: Forget it.
E: tossing it off
C: CLINT
D: Forget it?
E: did he hear correctly
N: Arly pays no attention to Clint. She is looking o.s. and stops walking.
S: EXT. GROUNDS NEAR TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY
N: Tala, on his horse, as seen by Arly. Over the scene comes Arly's voice calling from a distance.
C: ARLY
D: Tala.
E: calling
N: Tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly different angle. ARLY AND CLINT Arly is looking o.s. toward Tala. Clint is now eyeing his sister up and down quite openly. She turns her head now and catches Clint looking her over.
C: ARLY
D: Well --
E: after a stilted pause
C: CLINT
D: What is this? --
E: with a perplexed smile
N: A gesture of his hand indicates the way Arly has gotten herself up. That quick, Arly's hand goes to the flower in her hair. And, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it.
C: ARLY
D: What do you mean?
E: bravely nonchalant
C: CLINT
D: What do I mean? --
N: Before he can explain, Tala pulls up in his horse and we hear his voice over the scene.
C: TALA'S VOICE
D: Good morning, Arliete.
N: ARLY, TALA AND CLINT Tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl.
C: ARLY
D: Good morning, Tala.
C: TALA
D: You have make yourself very pretty today.
N: Arly is jolted by Tala's innocent remark, and she can't help giving Clint a little side glance in the way of reaction. Clint has not missed Tala's crack nor Arly's glance, and when she gives it to him he says:
C: CLINT
D: See what I mean?
E: pleasantly
N: He tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves, going up the walk toward the house. Arly turns to Tala.
C: ARLY
D: Have my horse saddled and sent around right away -- will you? You can have that Rocklin bring it.
E: then as a casual afterthought
N: She glances over her shoulder toward Clint going up the walk. And then, looking back to Tala, finds he hasn't moved, but remains smiling down at her.
C: ARLY
D: What's the matter?
C: TALA
D: Rocklin is not here.
E: easily
C: ARLY
D: He quit?
E: breathlessly
C: TALA
D: He has gone to the line camp at Table Top.
C: ARLY
D: What?
C: TALA
D: It was Mr. Harolday's orders.
N: Arly looks away. Her eyes stare blankly into space as she struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment. Tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the girl's side.
C: TALA
D: Why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts of him, little one. -- He is not for you.
E: in a fatherly manner
C: ARLY
D: Be quiet.
E: bitterly
C: TALA
D: He has made the choice, Arliete. With your own eyes you saw it yesterday.
C: ARLY
D: Oh --
E: impatiently
C: TALA
D: And she, too, has opened her heart to him -- Already she has summoned him to her.
C: ARLY
D: What do you mean?
E: this turns her around
C: TALA
D: Dave -- of the white beard -- carries a letter to Rocklin -- It is from her.
C: ARLY
D: How do you know that?
C: TALA
D: I have just now met Dave, and he tell me. -- So now he rides to Table Top.
N: Arly is quiet a moment.
C: TALA
D: Little one you --
C: ARLY
D: Oh, leave me alone.
E: quickly, as she starts for the house
N: LONG SHOT entrance to ranch. Entering the driveway from the direction of Santa Inez, comes Harolday, still looking the distinguished citizen. HAROLDAY RIDES UP TO THE PORCH - CLOSE TO ARLY AND JULIO
C: HAROLDAY
D: Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly. Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my desk.
E: to Julio as he dismounts
N: Julio exits. HAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems lost in thought. After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Looks like we're going to get that land we've been wanting along the river bottom.
N: Arly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues.
C: HAROLDAY
D: I didn't tell you -- but I bought the mortgage on the Hardman ranch, and it's due today -- On my way over there now.
N: Arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly.
C: ARLY
D: Did you send that Rocklin to Table- Top?
C: HAROLDAY
D: I did.
C: ARLY
D: Well, let's get things straight. This place was my mother's -- now it's mine and Clint's -- It's true you've been helping out -- but the way things are going we'll soon be able to pay you back every penny we owe. Meanwhile, I'm running this outfit and I expect to give the orders.
E: furiously
C: HAROLDAY
D: You generally do.
C: ARLY
D: Why did you send Rocklin up to Table- Top?
C: HAROLDAY
D: It seemed to me a good idea -- what with all this rustling going on --
C: ARLY
D: Who'd ever try driving cattle over Table-Top? -- Unless they were crazy.
C: HAROLDAY
D: I don't agree with you. In any case -- if you must have it -- I'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman's wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman!
E: coldly
C: ARLY
D: You take care what you're saying.
E: dangerously
C: HAROLDAY
D: It's you should take care, my dear. I'm afraid there's one man you can't rawhide into jumping the way you want. You've made a fool of yourself over him once. Better watch out you don't do it again.
E: very controlled
N: He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah. MED. SHOT as Harolday comes from the verandah to his horse. Juan is standing there with the briefcase which Harolday takes with a yank, mounts his horse and rides out. The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on Arly, who stands in furious silence watching Harolday ride away.

T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. It is addressed to: Mr. Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan.
C: DAVE
D: Durn funny -- that storm quittin' just about the time I get here.
E: during the above
C: ROCKLIN
D: No funnier than you sloggin' through it, just to deliver a letter from a woman.
C: DAVE
D: Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older I get.
E: disgustedly
N: Dave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for biscuits and putting it in the pan.
C: DAVE
D: When are we gonna get around to readin' it?
N: Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes himself in.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Thought I'd wait till mornin' -- might be bad news an' I wouldn't be able to sleep.
N: Dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his attention to his drying clothes. Rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes the dough from his hands and picks up the letter. He goes over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and sits on the bench. Dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around in back of Rocklin in order to see over his shoulder. The letter open, Rocklin takes out a roll of bills along with the folded message. He lays the envelope on the bench.
C: DAVE
D: Mmmm -- dineroo.
N: Rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment, and opens the folded message. LETTER. It begins with the usual Dear Mr. Rocklin. Rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from here.
C: ROCKLIN'S VOICE
D: Forgive me if this letter is a trifle incoherent, but I am terribly worried and unhappy.
E: reading
N: BACK TO SCENE.
C: DAVE
D: Who wouldn't be -- livin' with that ole screech owl.
C: ROCKLIN
D: I am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom I feel I can trust, and I am appealing to you, because I regard you in the same way my Uncle surely must have. I heartily dislike and distrust Judge Garvey --
E: continues to read
C: DAVE
D: Huh -- Smart girl --
E: interrupting
C: ROCKLIN
D: But my Aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him, and now wants me to place all my affairs in the Judge's hands and return east. Such is certainly not my wish.
E: going on
C: DAVE
D: Looks kinda like she's formed an attachment.
E: significantly
N: Rocklin glares up to Dave.
C: DAVE
D: For the locality, I mean.
E: quickly
C: ROCKLIN
D: I wanted so much to give ranch life a trial, but fear circumstances are against me, especially in view of the recent Indian trouble --
E: continues reading
C: DAVE
D: Indian trouble -- Good Lord, they ain't been any Indian trouble around here in --
E: explosively in normal tone
C: ROCKLIN
D: You want to hear the rest of this?
E: caustically
C: DAVE
D: Might's well -- come this far.
E: getting the inference
C: ROCKLIN
D: I want to apologize for what took place this afternoon. And I am returning the 150, because I feel it is rightfully yours. You must take it. Faithfully yours, Clara Caldwell.
E: reading
N: The letter finished, Rocklin regards it a moment, then slowly returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the fire. Dave meantime straightens up -- scratches his shaggy top, and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes.
C: DAVE
D: Well -- what do you make of it?
E: feeling his socks
N: Rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Somebody's sure bustin' to get her out of there.
N: Dave sits alongside Rocklin and begins putting on his socks.
C: DAVE
D: Indian trouble --
C: ROCKLIN
D: Wonder why the old lady's playin' along?
E: after a pause
C: DAVE
D: Baaa -- Wimmen -- Who can ever figure 'em? Got to admit though, I feel a mite sorry for the young'un -- nice little tyke.
E: sourly pause
C: ROCKLIN
D: Too nice for this country.
C: DAVE
D: She's shore a pretty thing.
E: after a slight pause
N: Rocklin has been mulling things over.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Don't know how I could help her -- even if I wanted to -- I don't know any thing about this Garvey -- or Caldwell -- or --
C: DAVE
D: Well, now -- I could mebbe help you out some, there -- Fact, I could tell you somethin' 'bout ole Red that might be interestin'.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You must have known him pretty well -- What kind of a man was he?
N: Rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits. Dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt.
C: DAVE
D: Caldwell? -- The best -- cantankerous cuss -- but a real cowman, believe me -- He was a big feller, like yourself -- Fact, you coulda passed fer a blood relation, come to think of it.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Was the Judge and Red friends?
E: casually, as he busies himself with the biscuits
C: DAVE
D: That's what you'd say. Garvey managed all Red's business. Besides which they was regular drinkin' pals -- played poker together most nights -- tho' they do say Red got the worst of it.
E: anigmatically
C: ROCKLIN
D: Red was a gambler, eh?
C: DAVE
D: Oh, yeah -- reckon a pretty poor one, tho' -- still you'd say him and Garvey was friends.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Anything ever happen to make you think they weren't?
E: after a side glance to Dave
C: DAVE
D: Rock -- I'm gonna tell you somethin' I ain't never told anybody.
E: moves close to Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: Think you can trust me?
E: with a slight smile
N: Dave grimaces his confidence.
C: DAVE
D: The last time I seen Red was the day he died --
N: In the pause Rocklin remains silent.
C: DAVE
D: -- 'Twas in town -- he jus' come out of the stage office. Tried to book passage to Garden City but couldn't on account I had a full load. -- Well, sir, he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says, "Read it." I looked it over and fer as I could see it was a paper from one of them Chicago sportin' firms, tellin' how to manipulate trick playin' cards.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Marked cards.
C: DAVE
D: Reckon so. -- Seems Red found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night.
E: nods
C: ROCKLIN
D: Whose was it?
C: DAVE
D: Well, now that's just what I asked -- but all he said, was that it belonged to a good friend. Then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone.
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's when they got him.
C: DAVE
D: Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from Stan's place. A bullet in the back an' his pockets empty.
C: ROCKLIN
D: How come you never told this before?
C: DAVE
D: Who was there to tell? -- Sheriff Jackson? -- Him an' Garvey's thick as thieves.
C: ROCKLIN
D: How about what's his name -- Harolday? -- He's no friend of the Judge's, is he?
C: DAVE
D: Hates his guts -- sure riles him to see young Clint hangin' onto the Judge's coattails. All the same, I jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' about -- it don't follow that he killed him.
E: after a pause
C: DAVE
D: No -- general opinion is that it was rustlers.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him?
N: Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as Dave talks.
C: DAVE
D: Looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards, you get the killer.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Funny tho' -- first the K.C. foreman -- then Caldwell -- an' now these women.
E: drinking
C: DAVE
D: Lordy -- you ain't thinkin' somebody might try bumpin' them?
C: ROCKLIN
D: I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried already -- Remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way Over from Garden City --
E: slowly, to himself to Dave
C: DAVE
D: Shore -- you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure he'd keep his mouth shut about something.
E: nods
N: Dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly under the large earthen jug of water.
C: DAVE
D: And layin' that gun across my skull -- an' offerin' to drive the coach themselves.
N: A SECTION OF THE CLEARING - MOONLIGHT A dark, mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle --
S: INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
N: SHOT.
C: ROCKLIN
D: It was almost as if --
E: nods
N: A shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug on the shelf directly above Dave's head. The contents pour down on Dave and he topples over. Rocklin meanwhile has wiped the lantern off the table and ducked. They are both on the floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You all right?
E: going to Dave
C: DAVE
D: Will be if I ever get dry.
E: blustering
N: Rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two holes drilled by the bullet.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Lookit that --
C: DAVE
D: Good Lord --
N: Rocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt -- straps it on.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Come on --
N: He opens the door cautiously. Then sneaks out, followed by Dave.
S: EXT. OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM
N: Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness. Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl hoots in a near-by tree. The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the corral. Both men re-act.
C: DAVE
D: My team.
N: Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's not your team.
N: He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave. HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal is seen, along with the legs of the rider. ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent toward the deep blackness of the trees. Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- Dave close behind. Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires. The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night. Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin has not moved.
C: DAVE
D: Come on --
C: ROCKLIN
D: No use -- he's gone.
C: DAVE
D: Mebbe we winged him.
N: He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back toward the cabin. DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail. ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses. THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form moving in the faint glow of the dying fire. ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN DOOR
S: INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
N: Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up something hidden from his view. At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut. The intruder whirls around. It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant. The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it. And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his. When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her feet. He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the floor. Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the bullet holes.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Not bad shootin'.
E: smiling wryly
C: ARLY
D: You think I did that?
E: right back at him
C: ROCKLIN
D: Sure -- to draw us away from here. You know, you cut it mighty close -- Good thing I ain't got brains enough to fill it.
E: looks at his hat
N: Rocklin puts his hat on. He sees Arly looking down at the torn letter.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Too bad you had to come 'way up here through that storm for nothin'.
E: suppressing smile
C: ARLY
D: I haven't minded a bit -- -- because I came up to fire you.
E: affectedly harshly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Oh -- I see.
E: nods
N: Rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag.
C: ARLY
D: Get out of here -- get off the Santee and don't ever come back.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Mind if I wait for Dave? He ought to be along any minute -- Be funny if he winged that shadow of yours.
C: ARLY
D: If you mean Juan -- you're loco. He's not even up here.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You came up alone?
E: mildly surprised
C: ARLY
D: Yes.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Then who was that we took out after?
E: half believing her
C: ARLY
D: The man who shot at you.
N: Rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up Arly's knife.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Who was he?
C: ARLY
D: I don't know.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You mean you won't tell.
C: ARLY
D: I mean I don't know -- Why should I lie to you?
N: That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face -- a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding?" He gets up from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly casual manner. It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it, quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine themselves around Rocklin's neck. In the middle of the kiss Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his neck and puts her from him.
C: ROCKLIN
D: I guess you forgot -- you jes' fired me.
N: He goes to the bunk -- picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc., and starts for the door. Arly has been silently watching.
C: ROCKLIN
D: So long.
E: turning near the open door
N: Dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door.
C: DAVE'S VOICE
D: Hey, Rock --
N: Dave now rushes through the door, puffing and excited.
C: DAVE
D: -- He got away -- but guess what, I --
N: He sees Arly and pulls up abruptly.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You guess --
E: slowly to Dave
N: Rocklin gives Arly a disparaging side glance and starts out.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Come on.
E: to Dave, who is trying to figure things out
S: EXT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
N: Rocklin is headed for the corral as Dave catches up to him.
C: DAVE
D: Fer a man who's got a despise fer wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled up with 'em.
E: glancing back to the cabin
S: INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
N: Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching the two headed for the corral. Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously.

N: LONG SHOT -- of Rocklin as he comes riding into town. As he nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is situated, the CAMERA MOVES IN, getting Rocklin and one of the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near the hitching rail.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You work for Harolday?
E: as he dismounts
N: The man nods.

D: Here's one of his horses -- I'll pick up my saddle later.
N: He enters the building.

N: PANNING SHOT on Harolday as he sits at the desk working on a ledger. The sound of a door opening is heard. Harolday looks up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes. CAMERA PANS to include doorway in which stands Rocklin.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Howdy...
C: HAROLDAY
D: I thought I sent you up to Table- Top.
E: frowning
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's right.
C: HAROLDAY
D: What happened?
E: slowly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Well, this, for one thing.
E: taking off his hat
N: He pokes a finger through the hole in the crown. Harolday's eyes narrow.
C: HAROLDAY
D: I told you you'd regret letting that rat Clews off so easy.
E: after a little pause
N: Rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying.
C: HAROLDAY
D: What's the matter? Don't you think it was him, then?
C: ROCKLIN
D: I been figgerin'. Don't seem reasonable Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone... Besides -- how could he have known I was up there -- that soon. And -- George Clews ain't the only one I've run contrariwise to in this town. There's that Mexican, for instance.
E: slowly
C: HAROLDAY
D: Juan?
C: ROCKLIN
D: He as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run-in one of those days. And then there's him!
E: suddenly nodding toward window
N: Harolday looks sharply toward the window.

E: excitedly sees Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: Was what?
E: slowly
C: CLINT
D: Was shot at last night.
E: subdued
C: HAROLDAY
D: Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all about it. Any idea who might have done it?
E: very calm significantly
N: Clint looks quickly at Harolday and back at Rocklin with frightened eyes.
C: CLINT
D: Not me.
N: Rocklin makes no reply.
C: CLINT
D: You ain't trying to pin it on me? 'Cause if you are, you're in for a big disappointment. I was over at the Sun-Up playing poker with the Judge and the rest of the boys till early morning. If you don't believe me, ask for yourself.
E: his courage returning
C: ROCKLIN
D: All right. I believe you. But that don't mean you couldn't tell a thing or two as would help -- if you wanted.
E: after a pause
C: CLINT
D: What d'you mean?
E: very nervous again
C: HAROLDAY
D: Yes. What sort of thing would Clint here know about, that would help identify the man who tried to kill you last night?
E: sharply
C: ROCKLIN
D: This for one.
N: He pulls out the tobacco pouch which Dave found at Table- Top.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Ever seen it before?
N: CLOSE SHOT Clint as he stares wide-eyed at the pouch. MED. SHOT group, with Rocklin and Harolday both watching Clint intently.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Well, go on -- speak up. Did you ever see it before?
E: harshly
C: CLINT
D: No. Course I didn't Quit riding me! I don't know nothin' about it I tell you. Jest because I had a run-in with you over a game o' cards, that don't mean I'd sneak up on you in the dark and...
E: avoiding Harolday's eye suddenly raging at Rocklin
N: Rocklin's disdainful smile takes the speech out of Clint, who just sort of runs out of words. Rocklin hesitates for a second then moves toward the door. CLOSE SHOT Harolday and Clint are at window looking past camera toward the street. They see Rocklin carrying his saddle, walking toward the Sun-Up. Shorty Davis hails Rocklin, says something to him and points to the Sun-Up. Rocklin leaves, walking faster.
C: HAROLDAY
D: He means trouble.
E: frowning deeply
N: He turns from camera toward the desk.
C: CLINT
D: Aw, what do I care.
E: still at window
C: HAROLDAY
D: Listen, I never did have much use for you. You're a poor specimen at the best; but as a would-be bad man you're nothing but a laughing stock. Why, the way you lied about that pouch just now wouldn't have deceived a six-year old.
E: turning on him with cold fury
C: CLINT
D: I...
C: HAROLDAY
D: All right, let it go at that. But I got myself to think of. It wouldn't suit me at all just now to have you shown up in public for what you are by that trouble-shootin' cowhand. My advice to you is to get out of the district and stay out. You'll find some money in the safe at the ranch. Take what you need and put the key in the desk drawer. Now get.
E: harshly taking a key from his vest pocket
S: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: Rocklin comes down the hall carrying his saddle and looking at the room numbers. As he nears the f.g. he locates the room he is looking for (it is a room facing toward the rear of the Sun-Up). He knocks. Almost immediately the door opens and Clara stands there -- flushed and embarrassed.
C: CLARA
D: Oh, Mr. Rocklin --
S: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: This is the room in which Clara has arranged to meet Rocklin, who later takes it as his own. SHOT at door as Rocklin steps into the room.
C: CLARA
D: I'm so glad I've found you -- I was on my way to the Santee and learned you were in town.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Just got in.
E: putting his saddle, etc., aside
C: CLARA
D: I feel perfectly awful, running after you like this, but --
C: ROCKLIN
D: You got trouble, eh?
C: CLARA
D: My aunt found out I wrote you and made a terrible scene --
C: ROCKLIN
D: You haven't signed everything over to that Garvey, have you?
C: CLARA
D: No -- and because I refused, Auntie said she would sign an affidavit that I'm still underage, and then, as my guardian she can do what she likes.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Got anything to prove you're not underage?
C: CLARA
D: No -- but Mr. Garvey has a letter that would prove it. My aunt wrote it before we came out here.
E: after a slight pause
C: ROCKLIN
D: S'pose we could get it?
C: CLARA
D: He'd never give it to me.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Wait here.
E: starts for door
C: CLARA
D: Oh, please -- you -- You won't go getting yourself in trouble -- I -- I'd rather give up everything -- I mean --
E: with a slight start toward Rocklin she hesitates, not quite sure what to say
N: Rocklin notes her confusion. He regards her with a slight sympathetic smile. Then opens the door and exits.
T: DISSOLVE OUT DISSOLVE IN
S: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT -- a letter written in a bold feminine hand. It reads: DEAR MR. GARVEY: In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this year. And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest in her affairs -- The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand. He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and smiles to Miss Martin.
C: GARVEY
D: That takes care of that -- Now, I'll draw up an affidavit right away and everything will be taken care of as we want it.
E: crosses to his desk
C: MISS MARTIN
D: I certainly hope so -- it's not myself I'm concerned about --
E: not too enthusiastic
C: GARVEY
D: -- Of course not.
E: getting out the papers
C: MISS MARTIN
D: I can't say I'm very happy about doing this -- I only hope it works out for the best.
C: GARVEY
D: It's the better choice of two evils -- now let's see -- I, Elizabeth -- It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
E: begins to write looks at Miss Martin
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Yes --
C: GARVEY
D: -- Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers, Massachusetts, do hereby --
N: The door opens and Rocklin enters. Miss Martin, who has been pacing nervously, stops in her tracks. Garvey, taken completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness. Rocklin eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door.
C: GARVEY
D: Well, Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a surprise. Didn't expect to see you so soon. I understood you were riding for the Santee.
E: leaning back in his chair
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's right.
E: coldly
N: It is quite obvious to Garvey that Rocklin is here on business. He turns to Miss Martin.
C: GARVEY
D: Perhaps you'd better come back later --
E: to Miss Martin
N: Miss Martin is in accord with that suggestion, and after giving Rocklin the frigid eye, flounces out, slamming the door. Garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to his desk.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: SHOT -- door to Garvey's office. Miss Martin has her ear glued to the panels. Over scene comes Rocklin's voice.
C: ROCKLIN'S VOICE
D: I came for that letter.
N: Miss Martin reacts.
S: INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: SHOT -- Garvey and Rocklin.
C: GARVEY
D: Did you say letter?
E: calmly
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's right -- the one Miss Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east sayin' she was of age. Remember?
C: GARVEY
D: No -- I'm afraid I don't.

N: SHOT -- door. Miss Martin reacts with nod of satisfaction and leaves.
S: INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer marked "C." As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits back in his chair, watching.
C: GARVEY
D: What is your interest in this letter?
C: ROCKLIN
D: My only interest is getting' it.
C: GARVEY
D: You realize what this is, don't you? -- Robbing -- armed robbery at that.
N: Rocklin pulls open the "M" drawer.
C: GARVEY
D: I warn you, you're in for a disappointment.
N: Not finding the letter in the "M" drawer, Rocklin goes to the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is locked.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Open up.
C: GARVEY
D: Listens, you -- There's nothing in there that'd interest you.
E: has had about enough suddenly controls himself
C: ROCKLIN
D: I'd like to make up my own mind about that.
E: grimly
C: GARVEY
D: All right -- I'll open it -- just to convince you I'm not hiding any letter.
E: forces a chuckle
N: Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards. The UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS. BACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin.
C: GARVEY
D: What's the idea?
N: Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.
C: ROCKLIN
D: These cards --
C: GARVEY
D: Anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession?
E: attempting to bluff it out
C: ROCKLIN
D: Depends on what kind they are -- 'specially when they're under lock and key.
N: The two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.
C: GARVEY
D: You're taking those, I presume.
E: too politely
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's right.
N: He takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm.
C: GARVEY
D: Now, you look here --
E: has had almost enough
C: ROCKLIN
D: You're the one who better start lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for killin' Red Caldwell.
E: soberly
C: GARVEY
D: Caldwell --
E: blanches
C: ROCKLIN
D: He found out about these -- and you went and killed him.
E: takes up one of the decks of cards
C: GARVEY
D: And you believe a story like that?
E: with an affected smile and unnatural calmness
C: ROCKLIN
D: I will until I hear a better one. I'll just take this along -- the district judge at Garden City should be mighty interested.
E: puts deck he holds, in his pocket
N: He starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove. Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The chair crashes against a window.
S: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers- by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy, the K.C. China-boy.

N: The two are now fighting in earnest. VARIOUS FLASHES of the fight, intercut with townspeople gathering outside.
S: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Dave pulls up in his wagon.
S: INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
N: It is pretty well wrecked. Rocklin has Garvey just about done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler enter followed by other curious natives.
C: DAVE
D: Say -- looks like you two been disagreein' 'bout somethin' -- He ain't daid, is he?
E: to Fossler, who has gone over to Garvey
C: PAP FOSSLER
D: Not permanently, I don't reckon. -- What happened, anyways?
C: DAVE
D: You musta found out somethin'.
E: to Rocklin
C: PAP FOSSLER
D: I reckon the Judge did, too.
E: with a wink to Dave
N: They exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself on the floor.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt?
C: GARVEY
D: Get out of my way --
E: getting up painfully
N: Garvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his living quarters at the back of the office. Miss Martin follows him.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Now don't you use that tone of voice to me -- I'll have you understand I --
E: haughtily going through doorway
N: She sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is, and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey slams in her face.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY
N: Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.
C: DAVE
D: -- Find out who owns that tobaccy pouch yet?
C: ROCKLIN
D: No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday.
E: staring straight ahead
C: DAVE
D: Clint -- Is he in on it?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Can't say for sure -- Bring him to the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an answer.
N: Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.
S: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as though deciding whether or not to question him. During this, Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette. The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up the outer stairs.
S: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a familiar voice inside. He listens.
C: ARLY'S VOICE
D: -- So now you know the truth. And if you think you can steal him away from me, you're welcome to try it.
N: Rocklin frowns and enters.
S: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
N: Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as he focuses his attention on Arly. Clara, who has been sitting in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to speak.
C: CLARA
D: Did you get it?
E: anxiously
N: Rocklin closes the door.
C: ROCKLIN
D: No -- but I don't think it's gonna matter much -- you go on back to the K.C. and I'll be out in the mornin' and take you with me to Garden City to see the district judge.
C: CLARA
D: But I hate putting you to that trouble.
C: ROCKLIN
D: No trouble at all -- I'm going anyway.
C: ARLY
D: You look like you've been fighting.
E: casually
C: ROCKLIN
D: What are you doin' here?
E: soberly
C: ARLY
D: I was just telling Miss Caldwell about -- well -- you and me.
C: ROCKLIN
D: What about, you an' me?
E: his eyes narrowing
C: CLARA
D: I think I'd better be going...
E: sensing the static in the atmosphere
C: ROCKLIN
D: Just a minute -- What all has she been tellin' you?
E: turning quickly from Arly glances at Arly
C: CLARA
D: Oh -- oh, really I'd rather not --
E: embarrassed
C: ARLY
D: Go ahead, tell him -- -- and I dare him to deny it.
E: interrupting looks at Rocklin and goes on defiantly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Deny what?
C: CLARA
D: That she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Well -- why should I deny it?...
C: ARLY
D: And didn't you make love to me?
E: quickly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Make love to you --
E: this is getting a bit thick for him
C: ARLY
D: You didn't kiss me -- I suppose?
E: forcing her point
C: ROCKLIN
D: Did you expect me to deny that, too?
C: ARLY
D: You see?
E: smiles at Clara
C: ROCKLIN
D: Now, maybe you ought to hear what I've got to say --
E: to Clara
N: Clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about it.
C: CLARA
D: Please -- you needn't explain. After all, it really isn't any of my business, is it?
C: ROCKLIN
D: You little --
E: in the pause he looks at Arly
C: ARLY
D: That's it -- start swearin'-- Just like a man.
E: quickly to Clara
C: ROCKLIN
D: If there wasn't a lady here, I'd do more to you than swear.
C: CLARA
D: I don't know how I can ever thank you for trying to help me. I do appreciate it ever so much -- Don't think too harshly of me, will you -- I --
E: to Arly
N: Clara can say no more without breaking. So she turns away quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn as he glares at Arly.
C: ARLY
D: She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet -- honest, and helpless.
E: sincerely -- after a pause
N: Rocklin makes no reply.
C: ARLY
D: Pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me.
N: Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may have sprained it slightly in the fight.
C: ROCKLIN
D: You might's well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin' to get me.
C: ARLY
D: Don't be so sure -- I don't think I'm doin' so badly.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Don't you?
C: ARLY
D: Don't you know?
C: ROCKLIN
D: I know there ain't a dirty trick you wouldn't play to get what you want.
C: ARLY
D: I always get what I want.
E: smiling
N: She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her.
C: ARLY
D: -- See? -- 'Bye now --
E: opens the door
N: The door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds it. CLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and pasted together on a sheet of paper BACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost. He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and stretches out on the bed, as we

N: The door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she freezes to the spot. ON Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's pause, she moves slowly toward Clara. The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Whatever is to become of you?
E: quietly but viciously
N: Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Have you no sense of pride, or decency? Throwing yourself at that -- that wretch, like any shameless hussy.
N: Clara hasn't moved.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: I thought we'd done with him -- but no -- you have to run to him and tell him all our business --
N: Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Don't you dare deny it -- you know very well you told him about that letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.
N: Clara remains silent.

The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss Martin already seen in the previous letter: Mr. Garvey, I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to have you investigated. I thought you had better know about it. E.M. BACK TO SCENE. Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he addresses Sammy.

S: EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun- Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost immediately and stares o.s. ANGEL From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway. CAMERA HOLDS Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene.
S: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: PANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the door brings him to a sitting position.

N: An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the rungs. The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear portion of the verandah.

N: Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off balance, then grabs him by the shirt front.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Talk!
C: CLINT
D: I tell ya, I...
C: ROCKLIN
D: Talk!
E: hitting him again
N: Completely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to speak. Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction. MED. SHOT window. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is hanging over the chair. CLOSE SHOT Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.
C: CLINT
D: No! No, don't!
E: in a hoarse scream
N: There is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach. With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor. SHOT window. The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin and disappears.
S: INT. BAR - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others. The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life -- gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction.
S: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his feet as Dave rushes in. Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, crowding the room and the hall. Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels over Clint. During this, there are general ad libs from the crowd.
C: AD LIBS
D: What happened? Who is it? Clint Harolday -- Etc.
C: PAP FOSSLER
D: Where's Doc Riding?
C: AD LIBS
D: Get the Doc. Hey, Doc -- He was down below. Here he is.
N: Doc's voice is heard from the hall as he makes his way through the jam.
C: DOC RIDING'S VOICE
D: Here I am --
C: AD LIBS
D: Look out, men -- Let the Doc through. Etc.
N: Doc riding comes through the crowd, kneels beside Pap Fossler. He needs only a glance to know he can be of no use.
C: DOC RIDING
D: Somebody better fetch Harolday.
E: breaking the silence
C: CAP
D: Shorty's already gone for him.
C: PAP FOSSLER
D: Better get Arly, too.
E: getting up
N: A voice is heard from the hall.
C: VOICE
D: She was at the hotel a while ago.
C: PAP FOSSLER
D: He was only a kid.
E: looking down at Clint and shaking his head
N: CLOSE SHOT Rocklin, still holding his gun as he stares down at Clint's body o.s. Now he studies the faces of the mob. PANNING SHOT of the crowd. There is nothing but a sea of hostile faces.
C: JACKSON'S VOICE
D: What's goin' on here -- gang way --
N: The crowd parts to admit Jackson, who comes stalking in followed by Judge Garvey.
C: JACKSON
D: What's the trouble here --
N: He stops abruptly as he sees Clint's body. Now he levels his eyes on Rocklin.
C: JACKSON
D: I warned you, didn't I? -- Well, I guess this is the last trouble you'll ever make in this town. Hand over that gun.
E: with a bitter smile extending his hand
C: ROCKLIN
D: Just a minute, now --
N: He steps back so no one is behind him. And there is something about his manner and tone that urges Jackson to use discretion.
C: ROCKLIN
D: I know it looks bad -- but I didn't kill the kid.
E: to the crowd, generally
N: The crowd stares in skeptical silence. Even Dave thinks Rocklin is lying, and now does his best to protect his friend.
C: DAVE
D: I believe you. His gun was layin' over there on the floor when I come in and --
E: to the others
C: ROCKLIN
D: No it wasn't -- It was right in my hand -- like it is now.
E: cutting in
N: Dave winces.
C: JACKSON
D: If you didn't know him -- then who did?
C: ROCKLIN
D: I don't know -- But I'm going to find out.
E: looks at garvey
S: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: Harolday, followed by Shorty Davis, is making his way down the hall from the inner stair landing. As he nears the crowd gathered at Rocklin's door, Juan comes into view down the hall, having just entered through the door leading out onto the verandah.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Where is he? -- Where's my boy?
E: as he nears Rocklin's door
S: INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: Harolday enters, over the ad libs of the mob, followed by Shorty Davis. During the following action, Juan enters and stands near the door, silently taking in everything. CLOSE SHOT Harolday, as he sees Clint's body and stops dead in horror. He turns to Rocklin.
C: HAROLDAY
D: You murderer.
E: with cold violence
C: ROCKLIN
D: I didn't do it, Mr. Harolday.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Then who did?
E: quickly
C: VOICE
D: He had a gun in his hand when we come in.
E: from crowd
C: GARVEY
D: And I'll bet it's the same one the bullet that killed Clint came out of.
E: smoothly
N: Rocklin gives Garvey a hard, slow look.
C: HAROLDAY
D: Well, what do you say to that?
C: ROCKLIN
D: He's right.
C: GARVEY
D: You admit it.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Yeah -- but that still don't say I killed him.
C: AD LIBS
D: Aw, take him away -- Liar -- Lock him up, Sheriff -- The yellow-bellied -- Etc.
N: ON ARLY AS SHE PUSHES HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD She stares down at Clint. An expression of pity comes over her. Now she looks coldly at Rocklin.
C: ARLY
D: Why did you do it?
E: softly
N: MED. SHOT with Rocklin in f.g.
C: ROCKLIN
D: I didn't.
C: GARVEY
D: He admits it was his gun that shot him.
C: ARLY
D: But you didn't fire it.
E: whose eyes haven't left Rocklin's
C: ROCKLIN
D: That's right.
C: ARLY
D: What happened?
C: ROCKLIN
D: Clint and me was having a bit of an argument.
E: slowly
C: ARLY
D: What about?
E: quickly
C: ROCKLIN
D: About whether he was going to help clear up a few things that's been bothering me and some others 'round these parts. For instance -- who it was shot Red Caldwell.
E: searching for words looking at Garvey
C: JACKSON
D: Caldwell!
C: ROCKLIN
D: And the K.C. foreman. And who took that shot at me up at Table-Top last night. And why certain people are so anxious to get rid of the Caldwell girl.
E: still at Garvey
C: PAP FOSSLER
D: How would Clint know about all that?
C: HAROLDAY
D: He's lying. He's trying to cover up for killing my boy.
E: harshly
C: JACKSON
D: Quit stalling, Rocklin.
E: encouraged by the support
N: He makes a tentative movement toward Rocklin but Arly intervenes.
C: ARLY
D: Wait a minute -- he's get a right to be heard. Well, we're listenin'.
E: to Rocklin
C: ROCKLIN
D: Well -- Clint was getting' all set to talk, when -- somebody snuck up along the verandah there and pulled the gun out o' my belt... ... and let him have it.
E: indicating the belt on chair
N: There is a moment's amazed silence. Then the crowd breaks into derisive comment.
C: AD LIBS
D: What a story! What an alibi! String him up, the heel! Etc.
C: JACKSON
D: You'll have to think up something better than that Rocklin.
E: grinning
N: MED. SHOT with Garvey in f.g.
C: GARVEY
D: Don't be a fool, Rocklin. You know you can't get away with a yarn like that. Why don't you save yourself and everyone else a lot of trouble by surrendering to the Sheriff? After all, it isn't such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self-defense.
E: smoothly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Self-defense?
C: GARVEY
D: Everyone knows what Clint was like. He probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you, like he did at the Sun- Up that night. Wasn't that it?
C: ROCKLIN
D: No, that wasn't it. And till I do what I got to do, I ain't surrenderin' to anybody -- least of all to your pal here. If I got to be shot for knowing too much, it ain't going to be in the back, in a framed-up jail-break.
E: grimly; after a little pause indicates sheriff
N: CLOSE SHOT Arly, who has been staring at Rocklin in frowning bewilderment.
C: ARLY
D: But if someone's trying to kill you, why didn't they do it just now? Why did they have to kill Clint?
N: CLOSE SHOT Rocklin.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Guess they wanted to get Clint, too. Doin' it this way they get us both. Clint first -- an' me afterwards -- like I jus' said.
N: MED. SHOT with Garvey in f.g. Close beside him are Pap and Dave, who watches Garvey closely.
C: PAP FOSSLER
D: Quit fancy talk. Who's "they?"
C: ROCKLIN
D: I might be able to tell you that later.
C: JACKSON
D: No you won't -- because you're comin' with me.
E: quickly
C: ROCKLIN
D: Am I?
E: raises his gun
N: The crowd tenses. Rocklin eyes them grimly.
C: ROCKLIN
D: The first one that moves -- gets it.
N: He moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled on the mob, steps out onto the verandah. Once outside, he suddenly lets the window fall and disappears. A shot from Jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has been a rush to the window. It is Arly and Dave who reach it first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they momentarily delay pursuit. AT THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE ROOM There is the inevitable jam as the pushing, yelling crowd all try to exit at once.
S: EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: Rocklin, as he picks himself off the ground, having dropped from the verandah. He starts quickly away.
S: EXT. WINDOW OF ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: SHOOTING INTO the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one side by Jackson and Garvey. The window goes up and Jackson steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others.
S: INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: The human jam has been broken, and now the mob dashes wildly toward the stairway, and verandah exit in the b.g.
S: EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
N: The hitching rail in front of the Sun-Up. There are a dozen or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team and wagon. Rocklin comes from around the corner of the building and races to the hitching rail. TOP OF OUTSIDE STAIRS Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. At the stairs they collide with some of the men who have raced down the hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment. There is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down at once. ROCKLIN AT THE HITCHING RAIL He has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail. We see him cutting the last line and fire into the air. The horses rare and stampede. THE MOB - WITH JACKSON AND GARVEY LEADING - COME FROM AROUND THE BUILDING And now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve their mounts. Rocklin is no where in evidence. GARVEY AND JACKSON - AS HAROLDAY JOINS THEM NEAR DAVE'S WAGON
C: HAROLDAY
D: Well, Sheriff -- you certainly are to be congratulated.
E: sarcastically
C: JACKSON
D: Look, Mr. Harolday -- you saw what happened --
E: harassed
C: GARVEY
D: Never mind that -- Let's get going for Garden City -- that's where he's headed for.
E: deeply concerned
C: HAROLDAY
D: You sure?
C: GARVEY
D: I'm positive.
N: Dave climbs into his wagon behind the group as Jackson exits quickly.
S: EXT. STAGE OFFICE - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT
N: At hitching rail. There are four or five horses tied up here. Arly and Juan enter and mount their horses, and almost immediately Garvey and Harolday come hurrying into the scene after two of the other horses.
C: ARLY
D: Where do you think he's gone?
E: shouts from her horse
N: Before either of the two men can answer, Jackson's voice is heard shouting o.s.
C: JACKSON'S VOICE
D: All right, men -- follow me --
N: The CAMERA PANS AROUND, getting Jackson, now mounted, as others come riding in. He rares his horse around and starts away followed by the mob, including our principals. They do not get very far when Dave's wagon comes into the shot, going hell-bent in pursuit.
S: EXT. ROAD NEAR EDGE OF SANTA INEZ - NIGHT
N: The posse riding hard, with Dave's wagon following. CLOSE SHOT Dave, half standing as he urges his team on. Behind him are the closed flaps of the wagon top. WIDER ANGLE as a hand reaches out from between the flaps and grasps the reins. Dave takes it, and looks wildly around -- falls back on the seat. ON ROCKLIN - AS HIS HEAD COMES FROM BETWEEN THE FLAPS CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Dave, smiling broadly. Rocklin is pulling hard on the reins.
C: DAVE
D: I mighta knowed you'd do somethin' like this. What are we doin'?
E: as Rocklin slows the team
C: ROCKLIN
D: Headin' for the K.C.
N: With that Rocklin starts swinging the team around. ON THE WAGON AS IT SWINGS AROUND AND BECOMES LOST IN THE DISTANT NIGHT WIPE
S: INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Sammy, the China-boy, is nervously knocking on Miss Martin's door. It opens and Miss Martin is seen slipping a robe over her long Mother Hubbard nightgown, with cap to match.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Now -- what is it?
E: impatiently
N: Sammy points o.s. -- Miss Martin looks and freezes. As she moves down the hall, the CAMERA PANS WITH her until it gets two men standing near the entrance door. Now the CAMERA MOVES IN TO A THREE SHOT and we recognize George Clews and his brother, Bob. Bob, his wrist bandaged, takes off his hat at Miss Martin's approach, and George noticing, does likewise.
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: The name's Clews, ma'am -- Mr. Garvey sent us out --
C: BOB CLEWS
D: Said you were expectin' trouble with that Rocklin.
E: eagerly
C: MISS MARTIN
D: I am. -- But I'm wondering if you're up to it. I noticed you didn't fare so well with him yesterday.
E: acidly to George
C: BOB CLEWS
D: He was drunk --
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: Yeah -- But I'm sober now.
E: quickly
C: MISS MARTIN
D: Well, see that you stay that way.
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: Don't worry, ma'am -- I've jus' bin waitin' to get even with that saddle- bum.
N: He opens the door.
C: BOB CLEWS
D: We'll be close-by.
E: with that oily smile
C: GEORGE CLEWS
D: You bet.
E: confidently
N: They start out.
S: INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Clara is seen in her nightgown, listening at the door to her room. The sound of the outer door closing comes over the scene and she hurries to her bed and feigns sleep, and just in time, for the door opens and Miss Martin sticks her head in, and satisfied that Clara is sleeping, exits.
T: DISSOLVE
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - ROAD TO GARDEN CITY - NIGHT
N: A raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a ribald song of the periods. And now Old Zeke, riding his burro, comes into view. As he passes close to the camera, we PAN and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the opposite direction Zeke is travelling. As the posse pulls up to Zeke, the CAMERA MOVES IN on a group including Zeke, Jackson, Garvey, Harolday.
C: JACKSON
D: Seen anybody ridin' hard for Garden City.
C: ZEKE
D: Bin on the road since sundown -- ain't seen a livin' soul -- be he man or beast.

C: JACKSON
D: You think so?
C: GARVEY
D: I'm positive.
E: very definitely
C: HAROLDAY
D: That's what you said before.
C: JACKSON
D: To the K.C., men.
E: shouting to the posse milling around
N: The posse swings around and starts back toward Santa Inez. ARLY AND JUAN Arly watches the posse, then turns to Juan.
C: ARLY
D: Take me through the canyon.
E: excitedly
C: JUAN
D: It is dangerous, senorita.
C: ARLY
D: But if we get through we'll beat them to the K.C.
C: JUAN
D: You would risk your life for Senor Rocklin?
N: Arly does not answer in words. But Juan sees the answer in her eyes. Now she tosses her head defiantly and swings her horse off the road in the direction of the canyon. Juan watches a moment, then spurs his mount after her, as we
T: DISSOLVE
S: INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
N: On Clara, tossing fitfully in her bed. Suddenly she sits up as an idea begins to take form in her mind. Now she hurries out of bed, moves stealthily to the door and goes out, leaving her door open.
S: INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
N: ON door to Miss Martin's room. Clara comes down the hall to the door. She puts her ear close and listens. Now she opens it cautiously and peers inside. The door to her room is slammed o.s. by a sporadic draft. It startles the girl and she quickly closes Miss Martin's door and hurries away.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

Julio is leading and close behind him Arly is having a time negotiating the unsteady ground of a landslide. ARLY AND JULIO AS THEY STAND CLOSE TO A DANGEROUSLY FORBIDDING PORTION OF JAW BONE CANYON She notices Julio staring o.s. and slowly shaking his head.
C: ARLY
D: Afraid?
N: Julio nods his head slowly, deliberately.
C: JULIO
D: Only for you -- you must not do this -- I will go through from here alone.
N: A faint smile of admiration brushes Arly's face.
C: ARLY
D: No, -- we're going through together.
N: Arly lashes her horse away. Julio realizes the futileness of further pleading and now moves his horse out after Arly.
S: EXT. ROAD NEAR KC RANCH - DAWN

N: WIPE OUT WIPE IN
S: EXT. ENTRANCE TO KC RANCH - DAWN
N: A wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway. On the gate is a crudely printed weather-beaten sign: K.C. RANCH. Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon approaching.

S: INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
N: We pick up Clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat in the dim light of a small lamp. She is fully dressed, and once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top coat which she finds in the closet. She takes the coat and starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret near the door. As she bends over to blow it out, her eyes raise and she freezes. MISS MARTIN HAS JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND STANDS THERE STARING ICILY FOR A LONG MOMENT Now she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from Clara, and starts forward. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the two. Clara stands as one under an hypnotic spell.
C: MISS MARTIN
D: You vile, ungrateful strumpet -- running away in the night, like a deceitful sneak-thief --
E: in a very low tone
C: CLARA
D: Yes -- I'm running away -- and it's all your fault -- you're the one who's been deceitful and sneaking -- and don't think I don't know what you intend doing.
E: unrestrained
C: MISS MARTIN
D: -- And don't think I don't know what you intend doing.
E: very controlled
C: CLARA
D: I don't care -- I'm not ashamed of it -- and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me.
E: crying, as she moves away
C: MISS MARTIN
D: You little fool -- if you go to Garden City with that man -- you stand to lose everything.
E: hardly above a whisper

E: stops pacing
N: ON DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING
C: DAVE
D: Yeah -- why don't you? --
E: nods and mumbles to himself
N: Rocklin quickly shushes Dave. ON MISS MARTIN AND CLARA
C: MISS MARTIN
D: All right, I'll tell you -- Rocklin is a nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell. And, as nearest of kin, he stands to get everything -- according to the will. Because you are not the old man's niece, but only his grand-niece.
E: Unmindful of the presence of the men
N: DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING - ROCKLIN SOBERLY - DAVE WILD-EYED
C: MISS MARTIN'S VOICE
D: Rocklin turned up unexpectedly --
C: CLARA'S VOICE
D: And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth all the time?
C: MISS MARTIN'S VOICE
D: Yes.
N: If Dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst. He spins Rocklin around and speaks in his natural voice.
C: DAVE
D: -- And you knew the truth all the time, too -- didn't you? -- No wonder you stuck around --
N: From Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that he is right. CLARA AND MISS MARTIN Both women are staring dumbly toward the window. Now the realization that she has been overheard staggers Miss Martin. She utters a stifled scream and, seeing Rocklin starting through the window, runs from the room. ROCKLIN - JUST INSIDE THE ROOM - TURNS TO DAVE
C: ROCKLIN
D: Get in here and take care of her.
N: Dave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of Miss Martin. Rocklin is at Clara's side.

But George is on the alert and strikes Rocklin on the head with his pistol. ON CLARA AS ROCKLIN GOES DOWN She utters a choked cry and falls to the floor in a faint. WIDER ANGLE as Miss Martin comes to Clara and kneels beside her.

Bob Clews backs up toward the wagon as Arly walks through gate. CLOSE SHOT of Arly. CLOSE SHOT George Clews on the wagon seat. He is smiling and is going to try to bluff it out.

C: GARVEY
D: -- Harolday wanted the K.C. like he wanted the Santee and the Hardman place, for his land scheme -- He planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers. He pretended to be on the outs with me so I could get Caldwell's confidence. And when Red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me -- Harolday shot him.
C: ROCKLIN
D: Why did he kill Clint? An' not me?
C: GARVEY

N: He starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves. Rocklin's eyes wander to Clara, who seems quite at a loss. Now he moves slowly toward her. In the b.g. Arly watches Rocklin's every move.
C: ROCKLIN
D: I guess there's no rush for you to get to Garden City, now --
N: After a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of Arly, Clara speaks.
C: CLARA
D: No -- I don't suppose there's any -- rush --
N: There is another short pause. Rocklin glances at Arly, and Arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the door, leaving Julio attending Garvey.
C: CLARA
D: If I was like her, I'd stay in the West.

C: ROCKLIN
D: That means you're goin' back East -- Cousin Clara?

In a moment Rocklin comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other way.
