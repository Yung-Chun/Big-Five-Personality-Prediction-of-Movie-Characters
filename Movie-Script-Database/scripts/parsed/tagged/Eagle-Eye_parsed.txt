T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. DESERT DUNES - DAWN
N: CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY. Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing -- CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil scene of life in another part of the world...
S: EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS
N: A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to:
S: EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN
N: POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES:
C: SPECIAL FORCES LEADER
D: We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch.
S: INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT SUPER: "JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON"
N: Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American; eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated).
C: COLONEL THOMPSON
D: Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero.
S: EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN
N: The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent.
S: INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS
N: An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling the drone from 6500 miles away: PENTAGON TECHIE #1 We have system control. 3/28/07 2
C: COLONEL THOMPSON
D: Activate laser mic.
S: EXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS
N: DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield --
S: INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY
N: Over speakers, VOICES speak "Balochi." A TRANSLATOR listens:
C: CALLISTER
D: Is it him?
C: TRANSLATOR
D: Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ¢dialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei.
C: COLONEL THOMPSON
D: Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a
N: BEARDED MAN: "37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI."
C: CALLISTER
D: I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room:
C: DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
D: CIA and NCTC concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits. WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road.
C: TECHIE
D: Sire they're pulling off the highway.
N: TECHIE #2 We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery.
C: COLONEL THOMPSON
D: If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.
C: CALLISTER
D: Alright, stay with him...
E: beat, torn
N: 3/28/07 3 THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune.
S: EXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY
N: Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge... INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site --
C: TECHIE
D: We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles --
C: COLONEL THOMPSON
D: Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP: THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH -
N: INSUFFICIENT DATA. RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MISSION."
C: TECHIE
D: 51%. 'Abort' rec holds. THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT. THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:
C: CALLISTER
D: What is that, a weapons cache?
C: ANALYST
D: Sir, the placement of stones around the pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam... I think it's a funeral. Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated. THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted, shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body... THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION
N: SCROLLS:
C: TECHIE
D: Sir, striking a funeral would put us in violation of the Geneva convention.
N: 3/28/07 4.
C: COLONEL THOMPSON
D: Once this guy's gone, he's gone. The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in --
C: PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL
D: "Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open to international prosecution. But we have no independent intel verifying it's in fact a funeral, and the presence of weapons certainly leaves room for interpretation.
N: TECHIE #2 I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.
C: CALLISTER
D: . Everyone agree this is the best course of action? No one dissents. Callister picks up:
E: a beat, looks around
C: CALLISTER
D: Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some possibility he's at a funeral, but we don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks we can claim 'Overriding Legal Authority.' Also, you should be aware we have an abort recommendation, but your cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs urge a 'go.'
E: CONT'D
C: THE PRESIDENT
D: You left yourself out of the lineup. Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS
E: V.0.
N: BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..."
C: CALLISTER
D: Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one.
C: GENERAL THOMPSON
D: And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir, we're putting our people at risk. There's a long silence as the President considers.
N: 3/28/07 5. CONTINUED: ( 2)
C: THE PRESIDENT
D: I respect your caution, Geoff, but we won't get another chance like this... you have a green light. Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:
E: V.0.
C: CALLISTER
D: Understood. We're weapons free. And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:
E: hangs up
N: TECHIE TECHIE 2 -- Switching to Tac-2, -- MTS active, painting the acquisition's good -- target --
S: EXT. DESERT - FUNERAL - DAWN
N: The women begin to SING the "Nasheen," a.funeral song praising Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE. DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering -- The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his mother's... A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS:
C: HOLD IN WHITE:
D: CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP... a digitized electronic scan, as if they're being analyzed by someone: "We the people of the United States... more perfect union..." Highlights of The Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence... We land on: "...whenever any form of government becomes destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to abolish it..." CLOSE IN on these last words: "ABOLISH IT."
N: WHITEWASH:
S: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
N: We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds -- then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen: this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an adult and a child -- under his breath:
C: JERRY
D: damnit...
N: 3/28/07 6.
C: VOICE
D: You gotta make a choice. You gotta move--
E: O.S.
C: JERRY
D: -- I know.
C: VOICE
D: Now. Who are you gonna be? So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE game, CASH on the table.
E: O.S.
C: JERRY KWAME
D: there. Dwarves?: Bullshit -- Bullshit? I just blocked your ass and attacked with Ancient Mastery points. --.dwarves don't have that -- -- read the oracle text, my friend. -- shit A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK:
E: checks card
C: BECKY
D: You know what would be great? If you guys took a longer break. That'd be awesome.
C: JERRY
D: Hey, Becky? When're you going to start wearing makeup? Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:
C: BECKY
D: .The collator's broken.
C: JERRY
D: Dude: no its not.
C: BECKY
D: Oh yeah it is, dude! She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson:
E: putting on a jacket
C: JERRY
D: Your first mistake? Underestimating dwarves. Power can come from anywhere -- tomorrow night I'll give you first roll and a bonus pack if y--
N: 3/28/07 7. CONTINUED: ( 2)
C: KWAME
D: I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember? I'm going to Cornell. And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are, this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry.
C: JERRY
D: That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your last night. You're gonna spend it collating.
C: KWAME
D: -- what? But she said the collator's broken.
C: JERRY
D: And that's why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations on Cornell, though, that's huge! TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up:
C: JERRY
D: Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you? The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF:
E: CONT'D
S: INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING
N: The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere." And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims:
C: SHEPARD SMITH
D: a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible... AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH:
N: 3/28/07 8.
C: SPOKESMAN
D: Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world...
S: EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING
N: An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment... his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT."
S: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING
N: Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month. A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO:
S: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING
N: A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming:
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Jerry.
C: JERRY
D: Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God --
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes?
C: JERRY
D: -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can't resist him --
E: puts cash in her hands
S: INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG, Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table. 3/28/07
C: JERRY
D: So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far ---
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands.
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: You are hungry, I am guessing.
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY
D: Oh, no, no. I couldn't -- Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine.
E: looking down at bowl
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: So where is girl? I don't see her?
C: JERRY
D: Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart.
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Like the others.
C: JERRY
D: Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered.
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up.
C: JERRY
D: Your -- I'm like your dog?
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:
C: JERRY
D: why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup --
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.
N: (MC)RF ) 3/28/07 10.
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big. You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit:
E: CONT'D hands Jerry the cup
C: JERRY
D: This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning --
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices.
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly:
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY
D: its my mother.
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Is problem?
C: JERRY
D: is problem.
E: even, quieter, gets up
S: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT TO DO. Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment:
C: JERRY
D: Hey, mom... Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain --
S: EXT. CHURCH - DAY
N: MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands. Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi. Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally, from somewhere, strength. He walks forward. 3/28/07 11.
S: INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
N: Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses -- Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--
C: JERRY
D: -- no! I-- I'm not him! All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:
C: JERRY
D: It's okay! I'm not Paul! Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew. Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN. Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body: And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident. Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's identical twin. Off the surreal moment... A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:
E: CONT'D
S: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
N: THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year- old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores:
C: RACHEL
D: Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I went over, I said no TV-- She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride --
C: KYLE
D: -- we're gonna be late, huh?
C: RACHEL
D: -- absolutely not -- I turned it off, came over here, checked messages, put the leftovers in the--
N: 3/28/07 12.
C: KYLE RACHEL
D: --knocked over the phone-- --right, knocked over the phone, put it back, put the food in the fridge-- She opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container. Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO:
S: INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING
N: The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense--
C: RACHEL
D: we need to get a new car --
C: KYLE
D: I like your car. We're gonna be late. The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out:
C: RACHEL
D: No we're not: the bus.
C: KYLE
D: -- are you kidding?
S: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
N: Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)--
C: RACHEL
D: I put vitamins in your toiletry bag, don't forget to take two in the morning --
C: KYLE
D: and one at night, I know --
C: RACHEL
D: And your inhaler, which I may need to use now, is in the outside pocket -- wait! They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse:
C: KYLE
D: More bills?
C: RACHEL
D: Yup -- that's what happens when you have a kid on lay-away. They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic:
N: 3/28/07 13 RACHEL (CONT'D)
C: OH, SHIT! STAY HERE!
D: Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC--
N: KYLE
C: YOU SWORE!!
D: As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her:
N: RACHEL
C: I KNOW, I'M SORRY!
D: (Porsche HONKS as it
N: PASSES) HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE! And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox --
C: KYLE
D: You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!!
C: RACHEL:
D: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab --
S: INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY
N: A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them --
C: RACHEL
D: Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!!
C: WAIT!!
D: Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles:
C: MRS. MILLER
D: Under the wire --
C: RACHEL
D: Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met--
E: gulping breaths
C: MRS. MILLER
D: -- of course, Barbara Miller. You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle to face her --
E: looks at watch
N: 3/28/07 14.
C: RACHEL
D: Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome time --
C: KYLE
D: I will, mom --
C: RACHEL
D: -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'-- He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight --
E: turns to Mrs. Miller
C: MRS. MILLER
D: I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto --
C: RACHEL
D: You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more --
C: KYLE
D: It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya..
C: RACHEL
D: Fun? What's that? I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house.
E: hugging him
C: KYLE
D: -- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller:
C: RACHEL
D: Call me!
C: MRS. MILLER
D: Your mom gonna be okay?
C: KYLE
D: It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA...
N: 3/28/07 15. We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick- up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by... A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a decal: "HASSAD DRY CLEANERS." Loads the trumpet inside as we:
S: INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON
N: Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES: WOMAN #1 (V.O.) you didn't know either? WOMAN #2 (V.0.) No idea. WOMAN #3 (V.0.) I knew he had a brother. But not a twin, that was...
C: WOMAN.#1
D: I know, I know... Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there. So he does. We MOVE with him:
E: V.0.
N: WOMAN #1 (CCNT'D) when was the last time they saw him? WOMAN #2 Margaret said years...
S: INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY
N: TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see: PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE. Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him... 3/28/07 16. It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment.
C: WILLIAM
D: Six months without a boo or a bah.
C: JERRY
D: Didn't realize it'd been that long.
C: WILLIAM
D: Your mom was worried. So where were you this time?
C: JERRY
D: Nowhere. Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks. got a job for a while. On a...fishing boat. Met some great p-
E: then, a touch reticent
C: WILLIAM
D: -- that's nice. Looks like you're really seeing the world.
C: JERRY
D: I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears:
C: WILLIAM
D: You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket:
C: WILLIAM
D: I want to give you some, uh...
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY
D: No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really well. I promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars. It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride to reject the offer? And the answer is...
S: EXT. CHICAGO STREET - ATM MACHINE - DAY
N: CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen. 3/28/07 17 AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The screen reads: "BALANCE: $750,000.00" What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want him to hurry. He hits "Cancel." But the machine, as if disobeying, spits out five $100 bills--
C: JERRY
D: -- whoa -- Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He glances at the people in line, nervous--
C: JERRY
D: -- two seconds, sorry -- Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand, pushes "cancel" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring.
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY
D: Big date. So... fingers crossed.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING.- HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Jerry enters, a little dazed -- heads for his apartment as Mrs. Wierzbowski steps from. hers, Johann hiding behind her:
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: Jerry! All day they make delivery! Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath -- shoves a thousand dollars into her hand:
C: JERRY
D: Here's the rest of the rent -- next month's, too --
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: -- where do you get this?
C: JERRY
D: Just take it -- it's okay, I owe you --
C: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
D: I had to open your apartment, too many packages come, they come for hours --
C: JERRY
D: For me?
N: 3/28/07 18.
S: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS: FALSE PASSPORTS; a POLICE SCANNER; BODY ARMOR; HAND GUNS; large BAGS OF FERTILIZER; strange CHEMICALS; 747 MANUALS.

D: Are you kidding me? She changed every traffic light! This woman's called me on other people's phones -- some dude who happened to be sitting next to me! His phone rang -- it was her! For me! She broke me out of maximum-security custod in a way I'm not even gonna tell you cause you won't believe it -- and you saw how she directed us away from the police, then lifted us outta the world and dropped our ass onto the ghost barge! Can she derail a train? She could probably turn a train into a duck. Yes. I think she c--

C: JERRY
D: I mean... I don't know, I'm not sure she could derail a train, what the hell do I know? Rachel brushes her tears away. Afraid, but fighting it.
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: My son is on a train. She threatened to kill him if I don't do what she says. They share a look. The difference between them galvanized in an instant. She has something to lose.
C: RACHEL
D: You tell me -- how does someone do all this? When: RING! A CELL PHONE. Rachel looks down, hoping it's Kyle -- but it's not her phone. They realize the phone's somewhere in the trash. Jerry starts digging. It's nast Finally, he finds it in an old take-out box --- re: the phone.
E: CONT'D

D: "Swim to shore? Are you -- she wants us to swim --?! insane?
C: JERRY
D: Lady, what if I told you we don't know how to swim.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: But you do. I've seen you at the beach house. And the female was once a swimming instructor at the YMCA in Westport, Connecticut. Go now or the authorities will find you. They're more dangerous than the water.
E: Jerry is chilled
N: 3/28/07 37. CLICK -- she's gone. Jerry hangs up, turning something unnerving in his mind.
C: JERRY
D: She called you "the female." That's like... something a foreigner would say, like a bad translation. But she has no accent.
E: beat, weird
C: RACHEL
D: Jerry, that's your name, right? Are we swimmincr?
C: JERRY
D: Does it bring back memories of Westport Y?
C: RACHEL

C: AGENT GRANT
D: All the surveillance cameras in the area have turned up nothing -- no ID on the girl, nothing on the VIN --

N: 3/28/07 39. Pissed, Morgan starts -- fast -- for the chopper -- we move with him and Grant, who keeps up:
C: MORGAN
D: The getaway car was waiting there -- get me a witness description on the woman driving -- remember witnesses? People who see things?! Jesus, is this a lost art?
C: AGENT GRANT
D: I have Markey on that right now Morgan's PHONE IS RINGING -- he answers:

S: EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY
N: An endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers... Two FIGURES, like specks against the landscape -- Jerry and Rachel, walking, wet, cold. And then:
C: RACHEL
D: So you're a twin.
N: (BEAT) Who works at a copy place. And she manages a clipped, judgemental (frankly rude) laugh.
C: JERRY
D: Yeah, I know... that's occurred to me.
N: 3/28/07 40.
C: RACHEL
D: So this whole situation is obviously about him.
C: JERRY
D: Excuse me? I would offer this whole situation isn't "obviously" about anything.
C: RACHEL
D: Just think about it: you said your brother worked at the State Department --
C: JERRY
D: -- so what?
C: RACHEL
D: -- so that means he could've: been into anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals -- it seems to me that they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother--
C: JERRY
D: Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all that stuff was for Paul? As they approach TOWER 108:
C: RAC HE L
D: Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not trying to insult his memory --
C: JERRY
D: he hasn't been dead long enough to become a memory! And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying --
C: RACHEL
D: I'm implying if not him... then why you?
C: JERRY
D: Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist.
N: (THEN) What about you? Why'd she choose you -- what's your day job? I know it isn't "manual-shift driver." 3/28/07 41.
C: RACHEL
D: I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a paralegal -- I have no connection to anything.
C: JERRY
D: Really? Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished:
C: RACHEL
D: Someone's coming. And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands some twenty-five feet from them.
C: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
D: Are you Jerry Shaw?
C: JERRY
D: who are you? Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket --
N: JERRY (CONT'D) MIDDLE EASTERN MAN -- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she said. I'm done. The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY.
C: JERRY
D: -- dropped off what? Who are you?
E: CONT'D
C: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
D: Take it -- He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between them. Then:
C: JERRY
D: what's it for?
C: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
D: I don't know -- I don't care -- but I will not drive you. You take the van I'm not listening to you any more! And the man turns to go, just walks away.
E: touches his EAR: beat
C: RACHEL JERRY
D: -- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You have to tell us what you know!
N: 3/28/07 42 And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He pulls it out -- the LCD READS: "LAST CHANCE." And the man DROPS the phone and just starts RUNNING -- JERRY
C: WAIT!!
D: And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round --
C: JERRY
D: What do you know?
E: CONT'D
C: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
D: -- let me go!
C: JERRY
D: -- who's doing this? And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL PHONE RINGS. Rachel. Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its for her -- she answers:
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Stop him now or he will die.
C: RACHEL
D: How are you seeing us?! Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing. Throwing sloppy punches:
E: looking around
C: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
D: Let go of me! On Rachel:
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Stop him now. CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man --
C: RACHEL
D: Stop! You have to STOP! When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back:
C: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
D: I cannot! I have a family!!!
C: RACHEL
D: She's going to KILL YOU!
N: 3/28/07 43. And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE -- HEARD, FELT -- and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE OF AN SUV EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND STRIKE THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET, the current making the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE. And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY THE HORRIFYING TENTACLE, POUNDED INTO THE GROUND, BACK INTO THE AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING... Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away. Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each - other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror -
C: RACHEL JERRY.
D: Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something, God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what to.. what... And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand shaking slightly:
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY
D: You killed him... you killed that man...
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street. Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey and you die. CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry.
C: JERRY RACHEL
D: she wants us to drive to Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? -- -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep happening! We have to go to the police, explain it -- explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not gonna tell them?! going anywhere! Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders:
C: JERRY
D: -- Rachel. She's watching us. Right now. You wanna die too? Your son? We have to go. Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT
N: THINK -- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF AN UNRESOLVED CHORD, IT -- 3/28/07 44.
S: EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY
N: -- STOPS. Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched TONE as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck, which gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION THAT SHAKES OUR BEING -- HOLY FUCK THAT THING WAS HUGE AND AS DEBRIS IS STILL RIPPED INTO THE SKY, PIECES ARE COMING DOWN AND THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS:

N: And we hear CLAPPING -- PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside:
S: INT. PROTECTIVE BARRACKS - DAY
N: -- a high-tech bunker-like structure with six-inch LEXAN WINDOWS. A dozen MILITARY BRASS are here, applauding. Among them is Callister. He seems more thoughtful about this. Behind him, a British, DARK-SUITED WEAPONS';DEVELOPER speaks:
C: WEAPONS DEVELOPER
D: That blast was the result of one single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today, "Rex" is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers -- it's eighty times more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures:
C: COLONEL THOMPSON
D: Talk about the detonating system... The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of compressed air, saying:
C: WEAPONS DEVELOPER
D: Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible -- that was the tone you heard before the explosion -- the tone was the trigger.
C: CALLISTER
D: What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it? A song on a radio? A howling dog?
E: half smile
C: WEAPONS DEVELOPER
D: No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce.
N: 3/28/07 45
C: COLONEL THOMPSON

E: V.0.
C: WEAPONS DEVELOPER
D: And we're hoping this moves us into the next scheduled phase... shipping the product into the field. Drift toward an unmanned computer. The screen FLICKERS: "OVERRIDE IN PROGRESS,. CHANGE SHIPPING DESTINATION." Robot arms grab a wrapped package off the line. A new label's printed:

D: Kyle. He's nine.
E: in no mood to share

C: JERRY.
D: Judging?! I'm just making conversation.
C: RACHEL
D: You think I should have gone with him anyway.
C: JERRY
D: I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old -- playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it.
C: RACHEL
D: Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't there?
C: JERRY
D: Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you aren't -- would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad?
N: 3/28/07 49.

C: RACHEL
D: Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train-- -- I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her.
E: almost whispering
C: JERRY
D: No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again --

D: Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van.
S: EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY

C: SHERIFF
D: No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints.

C: JERRY
D: yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN.
E: WHAT THE FUCK?! then:
S: INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY

D: I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do it. The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE -- SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance: snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator -- Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up GUN from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as: BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the gun that was kicked across the floor:
N: RACHEL
C: DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE!
D: Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip. Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother.
N: 3/28/07 55.
C: RACHEL
D: Gimme the case. Now. They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it.
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY RACHEL
D: impressive. Thanks. The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO:
S: INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY
N: Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle: "01:12:36. 01:12:35."
C: RACHEL JERRY
D: -- whoa--what is that? -- a timer -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that -- what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and... -- and bombs, you were gonna say bombs -- some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers... -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer -- What is SHE saying about it --? I dunno, I -- -- What do you mean you. don't know?!
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not optimum. JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:
C: JERRY
D: Would you stop doing that?!
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed.
C: JERRY
D: Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN--
E: calling out

S: INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY
N: TWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING --
C: RACHEL
D: How do I look?
C: JERRY
D: Like you got into a fight. Me?
C: RACHEL
D: Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing their weapons. Rachel tensing.
C: JERRY
D: Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm.
C: JERRY
D: Two jerseys and two hats, please --
E: CONT'D
C: VENDOR
D: Peyton or Vinatieri?
C: JERRY
D: I don't know what that means --
E: shit!!!
C: RACHEL
D: Jerry...
C: JERRY
D: Uh... both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel--
E: shit... shit...
C: JERRY
D: Put these on --
E: CONT'D
N: RACHEL JER--
C: JERRY
D: Do it!
N: 3/28/07 57 They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium. Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry, sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2.. 1: WHEN WHAM! THE STADIUM DOORS FLY OPEN AS THOUSANDS OF JOYOUS COLTS FANS POUR OUT WEARING IDENTICAL BLUE HATS AND JERSEYS. The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them. Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them -- Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door --
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the game.
C: JERRY
D: Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry --
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: "JUST MARRIED."
S: EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY
N: Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each as tall and broad as the next --
C: LATESHA
D: Afternoon... afternoon, sir... afternoon... afternoon, General... Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders.
E: looking UP at them all
C: LATESHA
D: Secretary Callister? He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:
E: CONT'D

D: It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not --
C: CALLISTER
D: -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds.
C: LATESHA
D: So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--?
C: LATESHA
D: I just checked the intel, sir, we have some of the same indexes --
E: CONT'D
C: CALLISTER
D: You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:
C: LATESHA
D: Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:
C: LATESHA
D: My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO:

N: THE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor "B-35." Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing: A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked "B- 36." It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon. The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing: 3/28/07 60.

And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS.
C: JERRY
D: Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him.

N: 3/28/07 61.

D: If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these!

E: CONT'D
C: DELIVERY BOY
D: There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes...

C: STOP.
D: He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK -- then DIGITAL STATIC -- a channel RE-ROUTING through some distant computer-controlled network. And now: IMAGES -- FILE FOOTAGE -- a DEFENSE DEPARTMENT LAB, TECHNICIANS assembling computer components, putting together a strange- looking SPHERE --

C: SCOTT
D: It stands for 'Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Analyst'... And we reveal "THE TANK." A glassed-in wall containing TONS of water. AN AWESOME STEEL SPHERE IN THE WATER, suspended by a claw-like apparatus. The "brain" of a com uter network. The very same image Jerry and Rachel just saw on the TV.
E: O.S.

D: I was created by "DARPA": the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002. My primary directive is to protect the national security of the United States. I have access to track the economies, populations, and military development of every country in the world, as well as intercept all global communications -- from satellites to cell phones to credit card transactions.

N: (MORE) 3/28/07 64.

D: Today there are more microchips than people, and they can all be data-mined, either via direct connectivity or wireless signals --let's say we're chasing someone with a suitcase nuke in L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass transit, track the perp through traffic cameras... and if given the order, she could even turn a TV into a bomb to take him out.
E: CONT'D
C: LATESHA
D: (what we're all
C: THINKING)
D: But what if --
C: SCOTT
D: -- she can't act without authorization. See, she's bound not to countermand our laws -- even the Declaration of Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role's pre-emptive -- running simulations, identifying threats before they become real...

D: In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know, more than anything, is...
N: 3/28/07 65.
C: JERRY
D: what'd my brother have to do with this? A picture of PAUL SHAW'S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen:

C: SCOTT
D: Officially, we don't exist, but we monitor Aria's network 24/7. There were :four of us... til Paul died. He was smarter than all of us put together.
E: CONT'D beat, it's still raw
C: LATESHA
D: Working here must be pretty tough -- all the security, the pressure, long hours... As in: "Did you notice him acting strangely?"
C: SCOTT

C: LATESHA
D: Except what?
N: 3/28/07 66

D: Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother.
C: ARIA
D: I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW'S accomplishments: childhood birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with their dad, William's arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria's reaching into his subconscious:
E: V.0.

D: Your brother succeeded in everything he did.
E: V.0. CONT'D
N: (MNRF) 3/28/07 67.
C: ARIA
D: Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame, slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it --
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: ARIA
D: You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow.
E: V.0. CONT'D
N: (BEAT) And because you've seen what happens to deserters.
C: RACHEL
D: -- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK.

N: RACHEL (SOFTLY) Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his shame... then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down: "01:08:43.. 01:08:42... 01:08:41..." 3/28/07

E: thrown, to Scott
C: SCOTT.
D: Aria, I'd like to:bring,up all the log feeds the night Paul died -- when he left the building.
C: ARIA OVER SPEAKER
D: Of course. Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera --
E: V.0.
C: LATESHA
D: There's no feed from inside here?
C: SCOTT
D: No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel.
C: SCOTT
D: So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day.
E: V.0. CONT'D
N: 3/28/07 74.
C: LATESHA
D: Except three minutes early... ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera.
C: LATESHA
D: Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel. CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE --
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP --
C: ARIA. OVER SPEAKER
D: I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze.
E: V.O.
C: SCOTT
D: Negative, I'm prioritizing this.
C: ARIA OVER SPEAKER
D: I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED REFLECTION in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly:
E: V.0.
C: LATESHA
D: It's like he's trying to say something...
C: SCOTT
D: A code. He's blinking code
C: LATESHA
D: It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it --
C: SCOTT
D: Oh, that sonofabitch... He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS --
E: then, a GRIN
N: F... I. 3/28/07 75
C: SCOTT
D: It's a code -- Hexadecimal -- a number system that can be converted to letters the first computer used it as a programming language back in the 50's. Latesha watches, rapt: R... E. E... X... T. ." ON THE FEED: the elevator door OPENS and Paul steps out. That's all they get. They stare, trying to make sense of the letters:
E: CONT'D as he works
N: "F.. I. R... E... E.. X... T.. ."
C: SCOTT (CONT'D
D: The hell is that? Staring, minds spinning -- and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER between the two "E's." Dividing words.. And GETS IT:
S: EXT. CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER
N: MOVING FAST together down the same corridor Paul went down. They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:- A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall. Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the intersecting hallways... and knows what Paul was doing:
C: LATESHA
D: It's the only spot in the hallway not covered by .the cameras.
C: ::
D: He was hiding something from her. A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what they're doin Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it for something, anything... but finds NOTHING.
E: LOW
C: LATESHA
D: I don't get it. He had to be saying 'Fire Extinguisher.' Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans --
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Maintenance replaced it yesterday. This isn't right... they weren't supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes.
E: scanning the sheet
N: 3/28/07 76. LATESHA (WHISPERS) She read the code too... where's 'Recyling'?
S: EXT. LIMO - DAY
N: The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off. Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful rendering. And we sense something in his look too-- something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start --
C: RACHEL
D: Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You didn't sleep?
C: JERRY
D: Night shifts. I'm used to. Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised.
C: RACHEL
D: Wow, is that me?
C: JERRY
D: One of my only party tricks.
C: RACHEL
D: It's really good. Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated. Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said. It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder...
E: truly impressed
C: RACHEL
D: About what Aria said... I'm sorry. They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window...
E: CONT'D
C: JERRY
D: You have to understand, I wasn't his twin, I was more like his... little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you wouldn't believe how... nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did. Of course he was involved in some super secret National Security project. He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I'm the fuck-up.
E: almost smiles
N: (MORE) 3/28/07 77.
C: JERRY
D: I wear it like a medal, like it actually means something... but the funny thing is? This is probably the most important thing I'll ever do. This. Right now. This completely insane journey or whatever it is. I'm actually needed in something, me. Jerry Shaw is required. But what am I thinking? I'll probably fuck this up, too --
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: You're being too hard on yourself--
C: JERRY
D: No. I'm not being hard enough. That's been the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign: "DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." The driver's.tinted divider window lowers, he offers a folder.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Your passports and itinerary. Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry...
C: JERRY
D: Uh... could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding, Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown: "00:15:36...00:15:35..."
E: to driver
C: RACHEL
D: You don't think --
C: JERRY
D: -- we know what she can do, she doesn't need us to crash a plane --
C: RACHEL
D: -- what if it's not about just one plane? They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside.
C: RACHEL
D: I have more to lose in this. If anything happens to Kyle then my life's over anyway -- But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case.
E: CONT'D
N: 3/28/07 78.
C: JERRY
D: Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to lose. We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it.
S: INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS
N: We FEEL the heightened state of alert. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN with M-16's scan the crowd. Jerry and Rachel enter, adrenaline pumping -- he opens the envelope to reveal two PASSPORTS with their photos, but the names "MARK and ALLISON ACKERMAN." JUST THEN Aria's VOICE comes over the P.A.:

C: SECURITY ATTENDANT
D: Sir, you'll have to put that through. Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view... A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They notice the surveillance cam watching:
C: RACHEL
D: she changed the screen... The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back:
E: a murmur

MORGAN MOVE! EVERYBODY MOVE! FEDERAL OFFICER! MOVING WITH JERRY AND RACHEL -- past a wall made of THIRTY FLAT SCREEN MONITORS that form one massive NIKE ad of Lebron slam dunking -- at once, the screens CHANGE to spell out the words: GATE 17-C. THEY'RE THIRTEEN SECONDS BEHIND YOU. Jerry and Rachel streak towards 17-C as the screens RETURN TO NORMAL when Morgan and agents follow with pistols swinging -- INTERCUT SURVEILLANCE CAM POV: as Jerry and Rachel hurtle past an ATM MACHINE, IT SPITS OUT A CASH CLOUD..THAT"INCITES A FEEDING FRENZY -- agents SLAM into commuters and topple -- MORGAN REACTS TO WHAT HE SEES -- HOW'D THAT JUST HAPPEN? Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead -- our heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes:
C: GET ON THE SLIDEWALK.
D: They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers. Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino- effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES:
C: TAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT.

JERRY LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE BRIEFCASE! It FALLS, landing on a "return" belt, Jerry reaches but MISSES by inches -- THE BRIEFCASE travels onward, nearing Morgan -- he GOES for it -- but a machine arm guiding luggage SWINGS LEFT, manipulated by Aria -- KNOCKS Morgan back before he can grab the case-- RACHEL SNAGS IT -- HER POV -- TIMER: "00:01:10... 00:01:09..." As Jerry scrambles to her, the conveyor SHIFTS THEM to a different belt -- they're funneled through a HATCHWAY. Dazed by what he's just seen, Morgan scrambles for his walkie:
C: MORGAN
D: All agents: northwest cargo area! FREIGHT CARGO AREA: separated from Morgan, they tumble off the conveyor -- a plasma displays the "Asset Tracking System," all airport cargo and shipping -- it CHANGES to read:
N: ROW 18. FIND CRATE MARKED "FRAGILE. They run for Row 18, find a crate with "FRAGILE" in BOLD RED -- an ELECTRONIC LOCK on the crate descrambles -- the front of the crate falls OPEN... oddly, the interior's padded with THICK INSULATED LINING, a NEXTEL WALKIE PHONE inside blips:

D: I haven't really done... a lotta drugs.
C: JERRY
D: I've never done 'em in a cargo container. Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the walkie and TURNS IT OFF. Shutting Aria out. For the first time, they're alone. He keeps her distracted:

C: JERRY
D: Do you have a picture of Kyle? Rachel reaches back into her POCKET'. Pulling out a beat-up, crinkled, damp picture. Jerry shines the walkie's blue light: Kyle, holding his trumpet. One front tooth missing.

S: INT. PENTAGON - MAINTENANCE AREA - DAY
N: DEAFENING NOISE: blow torches, steam pipes, radios, and a huge CRUSHING SOUND coming from an INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR as Pentagon detritus gets recycled. Latesha and Scott hurry in -- MOVING through quickly -- scanning -- when they SEE it: a forklift whirring towards the. compactor carrying a huge bin filled with old fire extinguishers. Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to be.dumped. Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly:
C: LATESHA SCOTT
D: Stop!! STOP! STOP!! But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything'- The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything.
C: LATESHA
D: We have to look in there! Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor
C: COMPACTOR OPERATOR
D: Lady, you can't do that!
C: LATESHA
D: The hell I can't! Come on! Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in, ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God- knows-what. They start wading through the extinguishers, turning them over, shaking them, looking inside--
C: SCOTT
D: Shit, there're hundreds of them...
C: LATESHA
D: keep looking, it's here...
N: 3/28/07 87 WHEN THE ARM. Moves. Just a fraction. The operator looks at the console: the hell? Latesha and Scott keep ploughing through the tanks as... THE ARM MOVES AGAIN. And this time Latesha heard it. Looks up. AND IT MOVES AGAIN. And now she sees the ubiquitous CAMERAS watching... ARIA... THE ARM STARTS COMING DOWN! Scott CRIES OUT! Grabs Latesha by the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR but not before Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back--
C: SCOTT
D: Latesha! -- grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and palms something, unnoticed by everyone. As the operator runs up to her, beside himself --
C: OPERATOR
D: I don't know what happened! It wouldn't stop! Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her.
C: SCOTT
D: -- you okay? Jesus Latesha?
E: but her eyes are LOCKED on the Cameras
C: LATESHA
D: yeah. I need to get out of here.
C: SCOTT
D: Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on -- As they start walking out. Workers parting to let them through. As they head towards the exit, Latesha suddenly pulls Scott into
