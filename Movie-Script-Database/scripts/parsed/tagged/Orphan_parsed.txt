T: FADE IN:
N: CLOSE -- KATE COLEMAN (MID 30S ) She's a simple beauty and very pregnant, propped up in a bed, wearing a hospital gown. A heart rate monitor BEEPS. She touches her swollen belly, flush with excitement, her eyes full of wonder.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Okayp, just relax.now. This'll be over Caitti before you know it. Kate looks up. Her smile falters-as we REVEAL:
E: O.S.
S: INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT
N: Harsh lights overhead. -THUNDER rumbles outside. Kate's on a. delivery table, legs already in the stirrups. A sheet hangs- across her belly so we can't see what's going on below her waist. A DOCTOR and NURSE snap pn gloves, prepare instruments: SHARP BLADES and CURETTES, NEEDLES and FORCEPS. Kate is stricken. She tries to sit up.
C: KATE
D: Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't want to do this anymore. The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table.
C: NURSE
D: Your baby is dead. There's nothing. else we can do. Kate reels, her world turned upside-dowp. Emotional free-fall.
C: KATE
D: No, this isn't what's supposed to happen. My baby's alive!
C: NURSE
D: We're so sorry. A terrible loss, we're so sorry...

D: But it's still alive! It's moving! Feel it, you can feel it! Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse- pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs, disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps.
C: RATE
D: No, stop! I want to be asleep!
C: -DOCTOR-
D: TOO late for anesthesia.'' The baby's coming. You're.going to experience some pressure now... - Kate winces and bites her lip as the Doctor goes about his unseen work. A GOOD-LOOKING MAN in surgical scrubs stands behind him.. Bizarrely, he's videotaping-the whole thing. He's Kate's husband, JOHN . He smiles at her from behind -the camera.
E: late 30's
C: JOHN
D: It's okay, honeys You're doing great! The Doctor hands the scissors, now slick with gore, to the Nurse. H e takes a SUCTION. CATHETER and disappears behind-the curtain again. The Nurse - presses a button on a vacuum pump and the machine begins to HUM. Kate tightly closes her eyes.
C: KATE
D: This isn't happening. Wake up, wake up, wake up... Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric. W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING.
C: NURSE
D: Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman. It's a girl . The Nurse offers her the bloody, blanketed bundle. Kate screams -

S: INT. LIVING ROOM -.DAY

S: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
N: Kate sits at a baby grand piano,'trying to compose a piece of.. music. She plays a few NOTES, frowns, tries again, takes a pencil and erases what she's written down. She pauses to look over-at a beautiful ORCHID in an ornate plants= by the window. For a moment, she just stares at it. Then: 13 1 She's startled by something outside BOUNCING off the side of the house. She closes her eyes, frustrated. BANGI EANG1 BANG! She tries to ignore it, but can't.
S: 'EXT. COLEMAN RESIDENCE - DAY
N: Max is playing basketball in the driveway, but the ball's too big for her and the hoop's too.high. Every time she tries to shoot, the ball falls short and BANGS against the house. Kate opens-the door, angrily signing as she speaks: Stop banging that against the house! I'm trying-to work!. MAX
C: SORRY.
D: Max gives an abashed look. Kate sighs. She knows she was too harsh with her.
C: KATE
D: -No, I'm sorry.. But just... take a break for a little while, okay? Max nods. Kate goes. back inside. A CAR pulls into the-drive.. It's John and eleven--year-old-DANIEL, Rate and John's other child. Daniel's blonde, brash, and-cocky, the all-American kid. He's wearing.a Little League uniform. Daniel runs toward Max. He steals her ball and dribbles-it around her in circles. -Max watches glumly. He offers her the ball, but when she reaches for it, he snatches it away and shoots a lay--up..-
C: DANIEL
D: Boo -yahl He shoots! He scores!
C: JOHN

Kate freezes. He can't see the-nervous look that crosses her face. He moves closer, pushes her hair aside, kissing hex-. neck. Kate responds stiffly, trying to get. in the mood. He slides a hand around her waist, moves it up to her breast...
C: KATE

Her. back is to us, so.we can't see her face, just curls of platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders. She sits at an easel, all alone, painting another extraordinary picture. John watches, curious. Suddenly; she senses his presence. She- stops humming, the paintbrush freezes mid-stroke. She turns. She looks about eight years old, with pale skin and-bright, doe- like eyes, her delicate features framed by Shirley Temple curls. It's the face- of a porcelain angel, a perfect little laving doll, friendly and inviting. She wears a thick black velvet ribbon around her neck and one around each wrist. Her'name is ESTHER.

C: JOHN
D: Well, I hope she finds them.
C: ESTHER

D: I think we can handle that.
C: SISTER.ABIGAIL
D: She's also fiercely independent., Whatever the other-children want to do, she wants to.dc the opposite.
C: JOHN
D: She told me they make fun of her.
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: I'm sure they do, but she doesn't make- things any easier on herself. She just doesn't seem interested in friends.. She doesn't even play like a normal child. She just reads and paints. Most of the time she barely-speaks.
C: KATE
D: Why do'you think that is?
N: SISTER ABIGAIL . Well, like most of the girls here, there's been no shortage of hardship in her life.- She's been orphaned twice-- her birthmother died of AIDS, then the American family who adopted her was- killed in.a house fire. And I strongly suspect that she's been sexually abused as well.
C: KATE
D: By who?
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: I don't know. There's nothing in her -history, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Russian adoption - records. are notoriously unreliable.
C: JOHN
D: Then what are you basing this on? Sister Abigail hesitates. Deciding how much to say.
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: I wish I knew. There's just something missing with her. A-spark you see in a child's eyes that isn't there. I've only seen that-before in cases where the child had been severely traumatized. It might also explain - some of her idiosyncratic behaviors.
C: JOHN
D: Like what?
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: She refuses to shower or change clothes with the other girls.' She won't even allow the housemother in-the bathroom with her. She.'.s also very concerned with her physical appearance for her age. She's like a teenager getting ready for a date every morning. She insists on wearing dresses-every day. The ribbons around her wrists and neck stay on day and night. . The only trouble we ever had with her was when we tried to take them off. She kicked two of Sister Francis' teeth-out. Kate and Tohn are taken. aback. Abigail sighs.
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: I'm sorry. I'm 'not trying to discourage you. If you're serious, I'll do everything I can to-expedite the process, given the circumstances.
N: (BEAT) My one reservation is..this. When-an adoption fails, it's usually because the parents didn't know what to expect. -And'in this case, I can't' tell you what to expect because the plain fact of the- matter is that-I don't knaw. INT: HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY Esther is happily-helping a NUN clean the sanctuary. Kate and John sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel.

ESTHER ' Look for the key to the treehouse.' -Max nods and they start searching the room. Esther rifles through John 's desk. - Nothing. She looks in a closet. A DARK PLASTIC CASE with Two PADLOCKS on it catches her eye... Max opens a. keepsake chest and finds SEVERAL KEYS on:a ring. She excitedly shows them to Esther. Esther smiles and takes them. As they're about to leave,.Esther. Uses. She looks back at the- closed closet. Then looks at the keys. Max eyes her curiously. Esther slides a chair over to. the closet and opens it.. She stands on the chair, pulls down the case with the padlocks on it, and sets it on the floor. She tries a couple of.keys. Then -- CLICK. There's a GUN inside. A shiny revolver and a BOX OF AMMUNITION. Esther's face lights up. She.carefully picks up the gun{-turns it over, looks at it. Max's eyes nearly pop out. Esther gives her a sly look, then loads a single bullet, SPINS. the cylinder... .and points the cmn at ax. Ri.aht between the Bye
C: ESTHER
D: Do you -want to_ play? - A beat. Max shakes her head. Esther smiles, fingers the trigger. After a long, awful, pants wetting eternity, she lowers the gun.
C: ESTHER
D: You're right. We'd better not.
N: (BEAT) Not yet. -
S: INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY
N: Sister Abigail sits across from Kate and John with a grave look.
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: When you first asked about adopting Esther, I expressed some misgivings. But I wasn't completely straightforward with you. You see, I love children. I've worked with them my entire life. And the thing about love is that it sometimes clouds your judgement.
N: (BEAT) But the truth is that I knew there was something wrong with Esther from the moment I laid eyes on her. Kate sits up, concerned. John bristles. - KATE You said you suspected, some kind of abuse.
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: Yes, but there was something else. It was hard to say chat it was at first. Just-a feeling that she was a profoundly damaged little girl.
N: (MORE) SISTER ABIGAIL ' (CONY' D) (beat) s eemed Then I notaced that she - always k_ to. be around whenever ther' wwasa get kind of trouble.- Two girls iii a fight. And there she'd be . Someone would get caught stealing. And ell she'd - myself it Was But I never really. believed it. (beat) l who After you told me about the gir broke her arm, -:E -started wondering again. I called the achool:Esther went to while she was with the Wallaces and asked if there'd been any serious accidents while she.Was there.. One incident was still fresh in everyone's minds. A boy in one of her classes was stabbed in the throat with a pair of 'scissors. All the kids-who saw it happen said it was an accident, that he was running with the scissors and fell. But once again, Esther, was there. ANGLE - ESTHER is eavesdropping from around the corner. She slips away. BACK TO SCENE
C: JOAN
D: But none of these things were her fault.
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: That's; g I was reluc!tant to t anything bef ore. Now'I think th at may a have been a mistake. Children like Esther, who've spent their entire lives-in institutions, have never had' a chance to 'form normal, lasting bonds.. The longterm effects of 'this- can be devastating. In the very worst cases, children who fail to form early attachments are unable to learn the difference between'right and wrong. They can lie, cheat, steal --- .or worse -and and have no remorse whatsoever for their actions.' They view other human beings as objects, pawns for their amusement. And they can-be potentially very dangerous.

N: SISTER ABIGAIL - I've put in a call to the director there, but she could have easily slipped through the. cracks. JOHN - So the bottom line here is that you don't have proof of any of this.
C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: That's true,-I don't. But I believe the circumstantial evidence is enough to warrant taking the next step.

D: Do you think she had something to do with'what happened to Yolanda? A long beat. Sister Abigail hesitates, reluctant to answer.

C: SISTER ABIGAIL
D: Dear Lord! Are you okay, honey? Max looks up at her,-stunned, but unhurt. Sister Abigai1 is taken aback. She recognizes her.

Max startles,'eyes wide with shock. Sister Abigail falls and lies twitching on the pavement. Eyes staring blankly, one pupil wide from the head trauma. Blood trickles from under her headdress. As Max stares at. the body, paralyzed with fear, Esther scurries into Sister Abigail's car and finds her purse. She flips through her wallet. Cash, credit cards. Takes it all. Finds her rosary beads. Grabs them, too. Then she hurries back to the body.
C: ESTHER
D: Help me get her off the road. Max looks up blankly, then staggers .to her feet. They each take a hand and start dragging Sister Abigail's body, but she's heavy and they're little. It's all they can do to slowly move her. Then Esther hears something. There's ANOTHER CAR coming. It's still out of sight through the trees, but closing. Esther and Max hurriedly drag the body, struggling it to the side of the road, just as the car rounds the bend. Esther gives the' body a kick,, sending it rolling down the embankment. The car is almost on them. Esther and Max quickly hide under the bridge.. Esther grabs Max's backpack and pulls u wig _cm. The car reaches the bridge. Esther listens to it cross, tense, gun . ready... . but it passes Abigail's car and continues without stopping. Esther breathes a sigh of relief. Suddenly, there's a CROARING_noise from behind them.' Esther turns. It's Sister Abigail. She's still alive. She's trying to speak, but all that comes out is an awful'MOAN. Esther scowls and grabs the hammer. Sister Abigail looks up at her,' moaning louder. Then Esther brings-the hammer down. CRUNCH. The moans stop. Esther hits her AGAIN and AGAIN.

Then she looks up, her gaze moving past the wine glass to the window., Through it, she can see the backyard. It's the swimming pool that holds her eyes, its cold-surface rippling in the rain. But- she's seeing something else there, something awful. Impossible to know- what she's thinking, but whatever it Is, it moves her to action: She, abruptly grabs the glass and quickly empties it in the sink before she-can change hex mind. -Then she grabs the. open wine' bottle and pours it all down the drain.

E: off John's look
C: JOHN
D: I wanted you to come to me. That's why ,I didn't confront you with it last night. If Max had gotten hurt this morning, it. would've been because I trusted you tell me if there was a problem.
C: RATE
D: What happened this morning had nothing to do with this!
C: JOHN
D: l f ow do you expect me to believe that?
C: KATE
D: Max and Daniel are the only reason I'm still sober. I would never do anything that would hurt them.
C: DR. BROWNING
D: You don't think this behavior effects them?
C: KATE
D: You know damn.well what I'm talking about. _ Her voice is brittle now, barely controlled. A beat. The tears sta rt to spill.
C: KATE
D: When I look out at the pool and think... When I try to imagine what would have happened if you hadn't come home early that day... it makes me want to kill myself. I would the before I let something like that happen again.

C: KATE
D: I'm not the one you need to be worried aboutt Seven people close to Esther have died in the past year. Max was almost the eighth. now many more coincidences are you willing to ignore?

C: ESTHER
D: "Eight weeks before my due date, Jessica died-from several undiagnosed birth defects. I hadn't felt her move for days, but now that I knew she was dead, I started-to feel her kick again. It's called phantom fetal movement, like the pain felt in a missing limb. I was an amputee and my baby was the lost part of me. Because of other complications, Doctor Kosgrove didn't want to induce. So I had to wait to go into labor. For sixteen days I carried Jessica's body and felt her ghostnow a kicking in my-belly. y womb coffin and inside me slept a corpse." How perfectly hideous. No wonder you turned into a nasty, smelly drunk. Kate is dumbfounded, trembling with impotent rage and raw emotion.
