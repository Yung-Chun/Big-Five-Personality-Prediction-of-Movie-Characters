S: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA - DAY
N: A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara coast line frame this party of old friends. A trio plays Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert. CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND JAKE. JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50 is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this woman's appearance screams "solid." The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks, his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his glass of champagne.
C: JAKE
D: Happy happy happy...
C: JANE
D: -- Anniversary.
E: reminding him
N: Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile.
C: JAKE
D: Some things never change.
C: SALLY
D: Thank God.
C: JANE
D: I thought maybe you were drifting.
C: TED
D: He was pausing.
C: JAKE
D: Exactly.... Happy... Anniversary. You two have led an extraordinarily blessed life. JAKE As long as I've known you both, you've always managed to somehow do everything entirely right.
E: sighs, raising his glass MORE cont'd
C: JANE
D: -- That's so true.
C: JAKE
D: But, honestly, how can it be thirty years!?! When did we do that trip to Spain? It was for both of our what..?
E: looks to Jane
C: JANE
D: -- Fifteenth anniversaries.
C: JAKE
D: God, that was a great trip...
N: The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21 YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver puts his arm around his Mom.
C: JANE
D: Ollie, how was graduation?
C: OLIVER
D: It was fantastic. I can't believe I'm not in school anymore. When's Luke's graduation?
C: JAKE
D: Next week.
C: JANE
D: It's in three days!
E: correcting him
C: JAKE
D: Sorry! I mean this week.
C: TED
D: Are the girls going?
C: JANE
D: They can't wait. Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and uncomfortable.
C: OLIVER
D: How long is Luke home before he has to go back for work?
C: JANE
D: -- Only a week...
C: SALLY
D: Aw, that's it?
C: JANE
D: I know, I hate it. Well... Congrats again... Great party...
E: Agness joins the group, standing next to Jake puts down her champagne
C: OLIVER
D: You're leaving?
C: JANE
D: Yeah, I have some -- stuff I have to get done tonight for work... I'll see you two in New York.
E: Agness hands Jake a piece of cake. Jane works hard at not appearing flustered to Jake & Agness
C: AGNESS
D: Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.
C: JANE
D: Good. Well....
C: AGNESS
D: -- Jane, what are you wearing to the graduation?
C: JANE
D: Oh, a suit or dress, probably a suit.
C: AGNESS
D: Fancy. Okay.
N: Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally.
C: JAKE
D: See you there, Janey. Where are you staying again?
C: JANE
D: We're at The Park Regent. You said you were at The Four Seasons, right?
C: JAKE
D: I don't know. Where are we?
E: to Agness
C: AGNESS
D: We're at The Park Regent too.
C: JANE
D: Oh. Good. That'll be convenient, actually. Okay, so, see you soon..
E: hates this waves awkwardly
C: SALLY
D: -- I'll walk you out.
N: As they WALK AWAY, they HEAR:
C: AGNESS
D: So, Ted, do you think you can help us get Pedro into El Montecito for kindergarten?
N: ANGLE - JANE AND SALLY - WALKING INTO HOUSE
C: SALLY
D: I thought it was sweet how well you and Jake were getting along. Felt like old times.
E: laughs
C: JANE
D: Yeah, well, we know how to do this by now. It has been ten years.
C: SALLY
D: That's crazy.
N: Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness affectionately rubbing Jake's back. ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR as it closes after Jane. ON JAKE - AS HE TURNS BACK and sees Jane is gone.
T: CUT TO:
C: TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD GABBY
D: in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child. But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your mother. We are:
S: EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
N: The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of vegetables dot the landscape. Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and has an air of maturity about her.
C: LAUREN
D: Gabby, stop...you're never going to fit all this in... you can come back for the rest tomorrow.
C: GABBY
D: I can't come back t---
N: Gabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest.
C: GABBY
D: Oh, God...that's all my clothes.
C: HARLEY
D:  HARLEY Okay, your Mom is home. She'll figure this out.
E: sets the suitcase down as he sees an SUV heading to the house MORE cont'd
N: The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes.
C: JANE
D: Gabby, you're leaving now? I thought you were going in the morning?
C: GABBY
D: I know but my friends are all there and they wanted me to come tonight.
C: JANE
D: But honey, it's gonna get dark soon. You can't see out the back window. It's Saturday night. People will be on the road drinking...
C: LAUREN
D: Mom, she'll be there in a couple of hours, she'll be fine.
C: GABBY
D: Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here. I'll be back for it in a few days.
C: JANE
D: Want me to drive it down in the morning? I could be there by lunch. We could go to that big Bed, Bath, and Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby, can you look up from that thing??
E: Gabby's BLACKBERRY BUZZES, she laughs, thumbs flying
C: GABBY
D: I got it covered, Ma. Hey gangsta, help me carry these...
E: looking up to Harley
C: HARLEY
D: Yep....
E: exhausted
N: Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house. Jane seems worried as she watches them.
C: LAUREN
D: Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the house alone?
C: JANE
D: What are you....? No! -- I'm not! One of you is always moving out... But I am wondering who I'm gonna watch The Hills with?
E: Lauren looks doubtful Gabby re-joins
C: GABBY
D: Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.
E: huge hug
N: Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard. Harley joins the group.
C: GABBY
D: Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing this. Mom, you don't happen to know where Dad is, do you? I tried calling him to say goodbye...
E: walks to her car
C: JANE
D: He was at Sally and Ted's.
C: HARLEY
D: He was? How was that? You and them at the same -- -- not that it's in any way, any of my... was just...
E: Jane turns to him
C: JANE
D: -- It was.... -- whatever. It was fine.
E: notices both girls wait for her answer
C: GABBY
D: Was her lunatic child there?
C: JANE
D: Not this time. Gabby, call me when you get there. Do NOT forget. JANE Gabby!
E: laughs MORE cont'd Gabby texts, deep in convo
C: GABBY
D: I will. I'll call you!
C: LAUREN
D: Knock `em dead, little one.
C: HARLEY
D: And call us when you get there, too. And no texting and driving.
N: Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and starts off.
C: HARLEY
D: They grow up so friggin' fast. I hate it. Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.
E: puts his arm around Jane's shoulder
C: LAUREN
D: Maybe you should get a dog.
C: JANE
D: Oh my God. Goodbye you two. Love you.
C: HARLEY
D: Love you boss!
E: heading for their car and getting into the passenger seat
N: As Lauren and Harley drive off, Jane turns and looks at her suddenly very empty nest.
S: INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years. Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen. The Kids have left a few glasses and plates on the island. Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses, allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of it.
S: INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY
N: This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get in. A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and friendly. Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass- through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.
C: JANE
D: Reynaldo...
E: nods to the muffins
C: REYNALDO
D: Too much sugar.
C: JANE
D: Little bit. Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray. Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter. Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of coffee with lids.
C: JANE
D: Who wants coffee while they're waiting?
N: Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee. JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.
C: JANE
D: Check on table five, will you?
E: quietly to a Young Employee
N: The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.
C: JANE
D: Peter!
E: all smiles
N: PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He holds rolled blueprints.
C: PETER
D: Jane, I can't remember, have you ever met Adam Schaeffer?
C: JANE ADAM
D: No. Yes.
C: ADAM
D: Well....
E: shrugs awkwardly 
C: PETER
D: Look what we've got.
C: ADAM
D: Your plans.
E: raises the blueprints
C: JANE
D: So excited!
E: to Peter
S: INT. JANE'S SMALL OFFICE - UPSTAIRS AT THE BAKERY
N: A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls, posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a few reviews. Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out the blueprints in front of Jane.
C: JANE
D: I've been thinking about this addition for ten years.
E: before she looks
N: Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.
C: JANE
D: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I like this wall of windows, Peter.
C: PETER
D: That was Adam actually.
C: JANE
D: Oh. Love where you put the stairs. That's so good!
E: still perusing, then to Peter
C: PETER
D: Adam's idea...
N: Did she hear that?
C: JANE
D: Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally - I have a real kitchen with four walls... It's...oh, wow...you actually understood what I wanted!
N: Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation. Peter looks to Adam.
C: PETER
D: All Adam. Jane turns to Adam.
C: ADAM
D: I'm happy you like it.
C: JANE
D: Okay. Hi.
E: finally noticing him shakes his hand
C: ADAM
D: Hello.
E: laughs
C: JANE
D: You read all my e-mails.
C: ADAM
D: All 47 of them.
N: Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the door.
C: OFFICE MANAGER
D: Jane, it's 10:15.
C: JANE
D: It is? Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30... dentist. Can you leave these and I'll make a few notes? Well, actually, I have one tiny note now. In my bathroom...um...no his and her sinks.
E: rises to Adam, re: plan
C: ADAM
D: Okay, sure. No his?
C: JANE
D: Just hers.
C: ADAM
D: And you don't think in the future you might want a his?
C: JANE
D: Oh, God, we're talking code about my life, right?
C: ADAM
D: No, no, didn't mean to be.
E: laughs
C: JANE
D: The truth is, in my current bathroom, I have two sinks and sometimes the other sink makes me feel bad.
C: ADAM
D: One sink. Not a problem. Can we schedule a meeting for next week? Does Tuesday work for you?
C: JANE
D: Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too early? At the house?
C: ADAM
D: I'll be there.
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING
N: Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room. The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR ENTERS.
C: JANE
D: Hi.
C: DOCTOR
D: Hi. I'm Dr. Moss.
C: JANE
D: Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted to start with... and please don't take this the wrong way but I'm the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery.
E: shaking his hand
C: DR. MOSS
D: I understand.
C: JANE
D: You do? Good, because, you know, some women can look a little fake and plasticky. And in my opinion -- worse.
C: DR. MOSS
D: I agree.
C: JANE
D: Oh, that's good, so, well, as against the whole thing as I am, I do have a problem that's been bugging me. My left eyelid is really saggy. I find I'm sometimes holding it up when I'm watching TV or reading and I was wondering if that's something you could fix.
C: DR. MOSS
D: It's resting on your eye lashes.
E: looking at her closely
C: JANE
D: Is it?
C: DR. MOSS
D: Actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides.
E: measures her lids with a very tiny ruler
C: JANE
D: I do? Well, I'm only interested in fixing one eye.
C: DR. MOSS
D: Jane, what you need to fix this is a brow lift.
C: JANE
D: A brow lift? Wh-what is that exactly?
C: DR. MOSS
D: We surgically cut at your hair line. Incision goes right across here. Then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull. We staple it back in place right above your ears. Recovery isn't all that bad but you could be fairly numb and you'll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6 months.
E: demonstrates on himself by indicating a line drawn like a headband Jane nods, already hating this
S: INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING
N: Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button. The elevator moves down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility Center. Helping Couples Become Parents. Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously mid-argument. Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up when they realize Jane is in the elevator.
C: AGNESS
D: Jane!
C: JANE
D: -- Hey..
C: JAKE
D: Hiii.
C: JANE
D: Hello.
C: AGNESS
D: -- Perfect.
E: pushing the Lobby button, mumbles
C: PEDRO
D: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.
C: JAKE
D: Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to someone.
N: Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the elevator.
C: AGNESS
D: Pedro, up! Now!!
E: she snaps
N: Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow.
C: JAKE
D: What are you doing in this building?
C: JANE
D: Dentist.
C: JAKE
D: You don't go to Sharon anymore?
C: JANE
D: Uh, no... changed.
N: Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness' back. It creeps her out. Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open. Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up his back.
C: JAKE
D: Honey, don't do that..
N: 11 As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS and as she answers it --
C: JANE
D: -- See you in the Big Apple. Pedro is now resting on Jake's head.
C: JAKE
D: See you there.
E: trying to be nonchalant with a kid on his head, smiles
S: INT. JANE'S KITCHEN/DINING AREA - THAT NIGHT
N: Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is flowing and the women are laughing. TRISHA has happily never been married. JOANNE is widowed and DIANE is divorced. They are all Jane's age and have been friends forever.
C: TRISHA
D: That is beyond....
C: JANE
D: -- When the three of them got in the elevator... between that and the staples and the headache for six months... it was the most insane hour of my life.
E: laughing
C: DIANE
D: -- Jake has lost his mind.
C: JANE
D: Oh, I don't know...
C: DIANE
D: I know. First of all, he was a complete prick for cheating on you.
C: JANE
D: Well, can't disagree with that.
C: DIANE
D: And then he marries her... a known lunatic.
C: JANE
D: She has a big job.
C: TRISHA
D: Why do you always say that?
C: JANE
D: Because she does. She runs the whole marketing department at KY, whatever that station's called so she's not that big of a lunatic.
C: DIANE
D: Janey, come on, he cheats on you with her, your 20 year marriage ends then six months later she leaves Jake for some random guy, has a baby, leaves that guy, marries Jake and she's not nuts?
C: JANE
D: Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead.
E: groans
C: JOANNE
D: Oh, thanks.
C: JANE
D: No, I mean, you never have to bump into him.
C: JOANNE
D: That's true.
C: TRISHA
D: Janey, you want to meet a guy I met on Match.com that I didn't like?
E: rises to get more wine
C: JANE
D: Gee, what a great offer. I don't think so.
C: TRISHA
D: He wasn't that awful.
C: JANE
D: Oooo. Sounding better every minute.
N: Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass.
C: TRISHA
D: You know it's not healthy not to have sex for...however long it's been...
C: JANE
D: Trust me... I'm not not doing it on purpose.
C: DIANE
D: Okay. I don't know if this is true, but I read on line about this woman who hadn't done it in so long her vagina closed up.
C: JANE
D: What!!! Get out of here.
N: All the Women SCREAM.
C: DIANE
D: I swear to God. It grew back together.
C: JOANNE
D: Wait. Was it ever one piece?
C: DIANE
D: All I know is, she had to have a vaginaplasty.
C: TRISHA
D: Ouch!!!!
C: JANE
D: Oh my Goddddddd.
N: Jane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head.
C: JANE
D: "Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little situation that needs fixing...."
E: lifts her head, then talks as if she's in the doctor's office
C: TRISHA
D: Bubbee, you want to fix your situation? Just date someone. Seriously. Anyone.
N: As Jane takes that in, we:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE PARK REGENT HOTEL - NYC - DAY
N: CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and Harley, just out of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their luggage as the Girls spot their brother, LUKE, heading toward them. Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek, then another tight squeeze.
C: JANE
D: Love when we're all in the same time zone.
S: A17 INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER A17
N: They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK.
C: HARLEY

C: LUKE
D: Oh, yeah. Big time.
C: JANE
D: What party?
C: LUKE
D: Are you guys gonna sleep over?
C: LAUREN
D: If you give us your bed and change the sheets.
N: They arrive at THE RECEPTION DESK.
C: JANE
D: You're having a party? When? Hi. Adler. Two rooms...hopefully next to each other.
E: to Reception Clerk
C: RECEPTION CLERK
D: I have an Adler, J. in a Superior Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two Standard Doubles. Sorry about that.
C: JANE
D: Yeah, we're not the ones in the Superior Suite. Have the other Adlers checked in yet? Just wondering.
C: RECEPTION CLERK
D: No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet. Now I just need a credit card and your signature.
N: As Jane takes out her credit card...
C: LUKE
D: -- Mom, is it okay if the girls come with me now and help me set up?
C: HARLEY
D: And by girls he means the three of us.
C: JANE
D: Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have reservations for all of us for dinner. That's not happening now?
C: LUKE
D: I don't know. Me and my friends are having this huge thing at our apartment and the girls said they'd help us set up.. We're going to be together all day tomorrow.
E: sees her disappointment
C: GABBY
D: -- Mom, it's his last night before graduation.
C: JANE
D: Okay, okay. Do you want me to help or...
C: LUKE
D: -- Love your credit card....
E: super sweetly
S: INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jane rides the elevator carrying both girls' jackets and carry ons as well as her own. Just as the doors are about to close, a Good Looking Couple in their early forties gets on. As they go up. The Guy has his hand around the woman's waist, his fingers fanning her butt. The Couple looks at each other, smiling privately. Jane looks away.
S: INT. JANE'S ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER
N: Two double beds. Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully dressed, shoes off, eyes wide open.
S: INT. HOTEL BAR AND RESTAURANT - TOP FLOOR - NIGHT
N: Jane ENTERS the hotel's posh bar/restaurant.
C: JANE
D: Hi. Adler. One.
E: to Host
C: HOST
D: Hi. Your table's almost ready Mrs. Adler. Would you like to wait at the bar?
C: JANE
D: Sure. You don't happen to have another Adler coming in, do you? Adler for two?
E: trying to read upside down reservation list
C: HOST
D: No... You're our only Adler this evening.
E: perusing
C: JANE
D: Thanks.
E: relieved
N: ANGLE - THE BAR Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot Younger Women.
C: JANE
D: Pinot Noir, please. No, you know what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini very dry with a twist. Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. It's fun being in a big city. Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles.
E: to Bartender
C: JANE
D: Where's your....??
N: Jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next to Jane.
C: JAKE
D: Pedro got the stomach flu so I'm flying solo.
C: JANE
D: Really? Didn't know you knew how to be by yourself.
C: JAKE
D: Any chance you could just go easy on me? Just a one night free pass. You look good, Janey.
E: noticing her
C: JANE
D: Yeah....
C: JAKE
D: You do. You always do. Your hair's shorter.
C: JANE
D: Longer.
C: JAKE
D: I like it.
N: The Host joins them.
C: HOST
D: Mrs. Adler, your table's ready.
C: JAKE
D: Want some company, Mrs. Adler?
N: Jane gives Jake a doubtful look.
C: JAKE
D: -- We both have to eat. When's the last time we ate a meal together?
E: sees Jane is hesitating
C: JANE
D: Just the two of us? Alone? 1999.
E: thinks for a sec
C: JAKE
D: So, come on. Once every ten years.
C: A HALF HOUR LATER
D: New drinks arrive for Jane and Jake. Physically, they're sitting as close as they've been in a decade.
C: JANE
D: So...how are things in the fertility world?
C: JAKE
D: I can't believe it took you this long to bring that up.
E: checks watch
C: JANE
D: Sperm issues?
E: trying not to laugh
C: JAKE
D: Apparently. Yes.
C: JANE
D: A baby?! Really Jake? So...the next time you go to a graduation, you'll be what? Fifty-eight plus...
E: tries to do the math
C: JAKE
D: -- I think the number you're looking for is 79.
C: JANE
D: Okay. So. Seriously, how is that good?
C: JAKE
D: Why are we talking about this? I thought we were going to have fun.
C: JANE
D: Where'd you get that idea?
N: A BOTTLE OF WINE IS OPENED and poured. The bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are sitting a little closer together.
C: JAKE
D: -- Just tell me, how long were you seeing him for?
C: JANE
D: Oh, please, it was five years ago.
C: JAKE
D: I know but I always wondered so...
C: JANE
D: Little jealous?
C: JAKE
D: Yes.
C: JANE
D: The man's married now.
C: JAKE
D: I don't care. How long?
C: JANE
D: Eight months.
C: JAKE
D: Long....
E: surprised
C: JANE
D: Not long.
C: A23 LATER A23
D: The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake are finally eating but still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story and she can't stop laughing.
N: OMIT
C: BRANDY TIME
D: A DJ spins for the after dinner crowd. Couples dance on the dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the song.
C: JAKE
D: This song reminds me of your birthday party... the one in our old house...
C: JANE
D: -- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun night.
C: JAKE
D: So fun. You wore that white halter dress....
C: JANE
D: Oh, yeahhhh....
E: remembering remembering it all, looks at Jake with a longing for her own past...
C: JAKE
D: Want to dance?
C: JANE
D: -- No...!
N: THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing. Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her. Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one another without inhibition. A mating dance....
C: JANE
D: You're married to someone else...!
E: astonished, laughing
C: JAKE
D: Tell me about it!
N: They both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close.
C: JANE
D: Hey.... I know you.
E: sexy....
C: JAKE
D: And I know you....
E: looking deeply into her
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. JAKE'S SUITE - LATER
N: They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a solid pat and hold.
C: JAKE
D: Home sweet home.
C: JANE
D: Oh......God.........
N: Jane covers her face.
C: JAKE
D: That was one crazy ride...thought we were going to break the bed.
C: JANE
D: -- I'm having an out of body experience.
E: not looking good
C: JAKE
D: Totally. You're so great, Janey. I forgot how great. Holy shit.
C: JANE
D: Please shut up. I'm so dizzy.
C: JAKE
D: And the pilates are payin' off by the way.
N: Jane moans, OPENS THE NIGHT TABLE DRAWER, leans over and throws up into it.
C: JAKE
D: Oh no!
N: Jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to Jake. Jake looks over at her.
C: JAKE
D: You okay?
C: JANE
D: Look the other way.
E: starting to rise
C: JAKE
D: Why?
C: JANE
D: `Cause I have to get up.
C: JAKE
D: Jane...I know what you...
C: JANE
D: Look the other way Jake!!!
N: As Jake turns away, Jane runs to the bathroom, carrying a pillow covering her bare ass. Jake hears her throw up again. He winces.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Jane sits on the floor, by the toilet, looking wiped out. Jake gingerly steps into the bathroom, hair a mess, wearing boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt.
C: JANE
D: WHAT is wrong with us?
E: looking up at him
C: JAKE
D: What do you mean? This was amazing. We just had a great time.
C: JANE
D: A great time? This is the dumbest thing two people have ever done. Jake sits on the edge of the tub. This is news to him.
E: giant moan.... 
C: JAKE
D: Really? I don't know.... I haven't thought it out, but off the top of my head I'd say it was smokin' hot so something about it wasn't so dumb. And, FYI, I like that you stopped getting bikini waxes. You've gone native. I was into it.
E: she stares up at him, sick as a dog
N: Horrified, Jane lets out a yelp on her way to throwing up again.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NYU GRADUATION DAY
N: The NYU Band plays Pomp and Circumstance as the Graduating Class of `09 ENTERS THE FIELD in caps and gowns. All the families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding. ANGLE - THE ADLERS Jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos. Next to her are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and screaming, "There he is!!!" And next in line is Jake manning the video camera, wiping away tears. ON THE FIELD, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives a broad bow. The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger whistle. Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes. The girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the ceremony. Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over at him. Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad. Jane turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY - NYC
N: The Family celebrates over lunch. Luke is telling a funny story about something that happened on stage at graduation. Jane is the only one not fully chiming in and laughing. She can't seem to move beyond what happened last night.
C: LAUREN
D: You okay?
E: sotto
C: JANE
D: Yeah. Totally.
N: UNDER THE TABLE Jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up Jane's leg and under her skirt. BACK TO SCENE Jane jumps, quickly turning it into a reaction to Luke's story. She gives Jake a private stare that says, "stop or I'll kill you."
C: JAKE
D: I would like to propose a toast to your Mother.
C: JANE
D: To me?
E: what???
C: JAKE
D: I've done my part with you guys, but Jane... you -- very talented you...
C: GABBY
D: Oh, God...
C: JAKE
D: Gabby, I'm serious. Jane, you did a magnificent job, as you always do...
N: The Kids look at one another...what's this about?
C: JAKE
D: When I look at the three of you beautiful kids...all grown up, I think of all the work your mother did, much of it without my help...
E: starts to well up
C: LUKE
D: Dude...pull it together.
C: JAKE
D: -- Janey, I take my hat off to you.
C: JANE
D: Okay, Jake. Thank you. Out of nowhere, sudden appreciation. But thank you. Really.
C: JAKE
D: Not totally out of nowhere, Jane...if you know what I mean.
C: JANE
D: Which I don't...but...
E: quickly
C: LAUREN
D: What's he...?
C: JANE
D: -- Have no idea. Let's move on, shall we? Jane holds up her droopy left eye.
C: GABBY
D: I'd like to say something too. For real. No offense to the lovely Agness or her charming offspring...
E: the Kids stifle laughs
C: JAKE
D: -- Not nice.
N: Harley stops laughing.
C: GABBY
D: I know. I'm sorry. But I just want to say I really loved today, just being with the original five... -- plus Harley, but he's like one of us. I don't think we've ever done this before... Had a meal together. And hung out like this...
E: Luke nods in agreement
C: LAUREN
D: You mean other than the first 13 years of your life.
C: LUKE
D: I know what's she saying. It's been awesome....just for a whole day to be just... us.
N: They all reflect on that one.
S: INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - LATER
N: The Adlers are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids chat behind them.
C: JAKE
D: Something feels right in the universe again, doesn't it?
E: to Jane
N: Jane looks at him but doesn't answer. She turns to the Kids.
C: JANE
D: So who's coming home when? No one's told me the details.
N: Jake's CELL RINGS. Jane half listens to his conversation.
C: JAKE
D: Hey. How's Pedro feeling?
E: into cell turns away
N: Distracted, Jane focuses on Lauren.
C: LAUREN
D: Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke up, the three of us leave day after tomorrow and Luke's home the end of the week.
E: responding to "Pedro"
C: JAKE
D: -- I will. Call you when I land. Janey, what flight are you on?
E: rejoins, finishing his call slips cell away, not missing a beat
C: JANE
D: I'm on the uh, the four o'clock.
C: JAKE
D: Ah, too bad. I'm on the five o'clock.
C: LUKE
D: That's nuts, why don't you try to get on the same flight?
C: JAKE
D: Yeah, I could try.
C: JANE
D: It's been...great, but let's not ... push it.
C: LAUREN
D: He was just trying to be nice.
C: JANE
D: I know. Okay, I've got to hit the road, guys. JANE Thanks for staying. So proud of you. Be good. Call me if you need me.
E: MORE cont'd kisses each kid as they line up she arrives at Jake, pauses, speechless
C: JAKE
D: It was really fun.
E: kisses her cheek
C: JANE
D: It was.
E: painfully
T: CUT TO:
N: OMIT OMIT A TREE LINED MONTECITO LANE - MOVING SHOT - DAY We are looking THROUGH A WINDSHIELD and listening to a SELF HELP BOOK ON TAPE.
C: MALE NARRATOR
D: -- Just follow a few basic rules to make your divorce a less hurtful one by breaking the cycle of conflict.
E: V.O.
N: ON ADAM - DRIVING
C: MALE NARRATOR
D: Accept your ex, for who she is.
E: V.O.
C: ADAM
D: A very big ho.
C: NARRATOR
D: And try to remember when you fell in love and...
E: V.O.
C: ADAM
D: -- There she goes...
E: spotting something
N: ADAM'S POV - JANE jogging right past his car, listening to her iPod.
C: ADAM
D: Jane!
N: She doesn't hear him. Adam backs up next to her. Jane slows down. Adam lowers the passenger window. She looks in, doesn't recognize him at first.
C: ADAM
D: It's Adam...
C: JANE
D: It's 8:30 Tuesday morning!
C: ADAM
D: Are we still okay?
C: JANE
D: Yes! Totally forgot! I'm so sorry! Can you give me a lift back to the house?
C: ADAM
D: Sure...come on in.
E: quickly cleaning up the front seat
N: Jane GETS INTO THE CAR just in time to hear:
C: MALE NARRATOR
D: -- But perhaps the most important lesson in going through your divorce is to learn to forgive. Forgiveness is the key to--
E: V.O.
N: Adam hits the CD KNOB to turn the CD OFF, but instead he accidentally FAST FORWARDS.
C: MALE NARRATOR
D: In spite of your hurt feelings, prove to her that you can be a mature--
E: V.O.
N: Adam HITS THE KNOB again and this time, turns it OFF, a bit mortified.
C: JANE
D: Just getting a divorce?
C: ADAM
D: Yeah. Two and a half years ago.
E: then
C: JANE
D: Wooo.
C: ADAM
D: It's been a process.
E: embarrassed
C: JANE
D: Here's the good news. In two more years you'll actually begin to feel normal again.
C: ADAM
D: In two more years I'll begin to feel normal? Why am I having trouble seeing that as good news?
C: JANE
D: Maybe that was just my experience.
C: ADAM
D: Oh God, I hope so.
S: EXT. HOUSE - LATER
N: Blue prints are spread on a garden table. Adam is drawing as Jane watches.
C: ADAM
D: -- So if we move this wall back a bit, that can bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right?
C: JANE
D: Yes, I'd love that.
C: ADAM
D: Thought so.
E: sketching
C: JANE
D: I have an idea... what if we move my bedroom like six or eight feet so I can get more of the morning light? JANE Not possible?
E: MORE cont'd sees Adam hesitate
C: ADAM
D: -- Yes, but you'll wake up in the morning, open your bedroom door and fall 12 feet into your kitchen.
C: JANE
D: Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up there!
C: ADAM
D: But I get where you're headed. Let me see what I can do... This property is so great... Have you lived here a long time?
C: JANE
D: About ten years. I bought this place right after my divorce but it's taken me until now to be able to finally do this.... Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude.
C: JAKE
D: Good morning! Am I interrupting...?
E: to Jane
C: JANE
D: Hi. No, well, we were just about done. Adam, this is my ex-husband, Jake. Jake, this is Adam Schaeffer, my architect.
E: thrown that he's here
C: JAKE
D: Hi.
C: ADAM
D: Good to meet you.
E: they shake hands
C: JAKE
D: Can I take a look? Do you mind?
E: re: plans
N: Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already looking.
C: JANE
D: Everything's not 100% worked out yet...
C: JAKE
D: Wow. You're finally getting the kitchen you always wanted...
C: JANE
D: Yeah...
C: JAKE
D: Huge bedroom.
C: JANE
D: It's not huge. Why don't I show these to you when we get a little closer.
E: suddenly insecure
N: Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little. Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes.
C: ADAM
D: So, I think next we should stake out the addition... see how it all feels - size wise...
C: JANE
D: Sounds great.
C: ADAM
D: I'll e-mail you and we'll set it up. We did good work today. Jake, nice meeting you.
N: Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car.
C: JAKE
D: Got time for a cup of coffee?
E: turns to Jane
N: Adam can't help but sneak a look back at them. Jane waves, a bit embarrassed.
S: INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge, taking out juice...
C: JAKE
D: Why haven't you returned any of my calls or e-mails?
C: JANE
D: Jake, come on. This is just too weird. We have to just never do what we did - ever again. You're an adulterer and I'm an awful person, basically. I haven't slept in days. What we did was just so wrong on so many levels.
C: JAKE
D: And it was so right on a couple of levels too. Admit it.
C: JANE
D: No! It wasn't! On no levels was it right!
E: finally settles
C: JAKE
D: You can't say we didn't enjoy each other's company. Sitting at the bar, dancing...after dancing... Come on, you and I haven't had fun like that in a hundred years.
E: she doesn't want to be reminded
C: JANE
D: Yes! Because we're not supposed to have fun like that! We're divorced! Are you like, what? Unhappy at home? Does she not "understand" you? Did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age? What is this?
C: JAKE
D: I'd be lying if I said I never think about you, Janey. I think about you. A lot. And no, it's not perfect at home. Obviously. Look at me. I've got three grown kids and I'm going to kindergarten interviews. I'm a walking cliche.
N: Jane shrugs. She agrees.
C: JAKE
D: And I can't, literally can't stop thinking about what happened in New York. Fate brought us together once, maybe it happened again. And I know... you've moved on with your life, I get it, but you can't deny something real and honest happened that night. Can't we just go with it, see where it takes us. No one has to know. You were so great. So loose and sexy. How often do you get to be like that? You can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night...?
E: she pauses... Jane shudders
C: JANE
D: Not high on my list these days.
C: JAKE
D: But what if that someone is someone who's known you since you're 23 and loved you for most of your life.
C: JANE
D: I forgot what a good lawyer you are.
C: JAKE
D: Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is short and it's tough. Don't discount what we have with each other. You know what they say... people in nursing homes who have plants live longer than the people without plants.
E: he's getting to her
C: JANE
D: Oh, so you're saying you think this is a healthy choice for me?
C: JAKE
D: Honey, I know it is.
S: EXT. JANE'S GARDEN - SPRINKLERS GOING OFF
N: And the plants get watered.
S: INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and sober. They catch their breath.
C: JANE
D: Oh, God, it's official. We're having an affair.
C: JAKE
D: Why do you need to label everything?
C: JANE
D: Because that's what this is.
C: JAKE
D: Yes, in its crassest form, maybe, if we were two other people.
C: JANE
D: Just because we were married for 19 years does not not make this an affair.
C: JAKE
D: Okay, but since we were together for so long, it's not really that wrong.
C: JANE
D: Really? You want to run that logic by your wife?
N: Jane fans herself.
C: JANE
D: Do me a favor, you're on my side. Can we switch? I feel disoriented.
C: JAKE
D: Since when is this your side?
C: JANE
D: Since ten years ago. Please...
N: They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands on top of Jane. He pauses.
C: JAKE
D: Could I interest you in a little...
C: JANE
D: No! They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed. Jane fans herself. So hot.
C: JAKE
D: Why do you think the sex is so much sexier this time?
E: turns to her
C: JANE
D: I don't know.
N: Jane pulls the sheet up. They look at one another. He gets her to smile.
C: JANE
D: I've gotta get to work.
C: JAKE
D: Me too. Okay...
E: moans as he sits up, then rises
N: Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed, checking out his stomach. He notices.
C: JAKE
D: See what happens when you're not looking out for me. She lets me eat everything.. pasta, cream cheese...
E: indicating his belly pats it
C: JANE
D: Can you hand me my robe?
N: Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her. She indicates Jake should turn around.
C: JAKE
D: Why do I have to..?
C: JANE
D: -- Because the last time you saw me standing up naked I was in my forties. Things look different lying down. Just...
E: Jake can't believe this
N: Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.
C: JAKE
D: You've gotten a little nuts.
C: JANE
D: Jake, I think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days. Okay?
E: slipping into her robe
C: JAKE
D: You know what I think -- just for the record? I think we're doing something kinda brilliant. All the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore. I'd say our problems actually went away.
E: turning back to her
C: JANE
D: What..?
C: JAKE
D: Didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? Wasn't that our big issue -- both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. Look at us now. You're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and I'm calmer, less obsessed about work. I'm a partner. I'm there. We grew into the people we wanted each other to be! And I don't know... I appreciate things about you I couldn't even see before.
C: JANE
D: Really? JANE Well, you know, I'm not as good as you at remembering all the details of our...
E: not wanting to get into it MORE cont'd
C: JAKE
D: -- Do you remember never having time for sex? Now look at us. We've already done it two times this week and it's only Tuesday. I swear to God, if half the couples who got divorced, could get back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved. I think we're on to something.
E: getting dressed
C: JANE
D: Not sure I agree and...also, we're not back together.
C: JAKE
D: And I know other divorced people think about this...they wonder - what if.... I think this is very French of us.
E: fixes his tie
C: JANE
D: How is this French of us?
C: JAKE
D: I have a young wife but I'm having sex with my old wife. Not old, you know. Ex! I didn't mean old...
E: Jane nods....
N: 39 Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head toward THE FRONT DOOR.
C: JAKE
D: You're doing that thing where you act like you're not listening... but think about what I'm saying, okay? Do you have any of your homemade granola here? I haven't had it in so long.
E: then
C: JANE
D: You miss it?
C: JAKE
D: So much.
C: JANE
D: We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the store.
C: JAKE
D: Yeah, why give it away when you can... Kiss good bye?
E: Jane OPENS the front door and moves him outside
N: Jane kisses him on the cheek.
C: JAKE
D: She wants to be courted! I can do that! And honey, thanks for the.... -- Coffee....
E: as he heads for his car turns back indicates sex with his fingers
N: Jane can't close the door fast enough.
S: INT. JANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table.
C: TRISHA
D: Oh my God, now what? Three pies?! This is a feast!
C: JANE
D: I don't know what's going on, I have so much energy lately which I think is probably a result of... all the sex I'm having. Yeah. I'm actually not kidding. I'm having an affair. With a married man.
E: the Ladies LAUGH They stare at her
C: DIANE
D: What? When did this happen? Where'd you meet him?
C: JANE
D: Well, it... started in New York.
C: DIANE
D: In New York??? Last week?
C: JANE
D: Yeah, we did it once there and once here. Maybe more than once there, I was drunk so...
C: TRISHA
D: You had drunken sex with a married man in New York when you went for Luke's graduation?
C: JANE
D: Turns out I'm a bit of a slut. Apple, Blueberry or Plum?
E: laughs, embarrassed re: pies
C: DIANE
D: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.... You're not saying!!!!
C: JOANNE
D: -- What?
E: clueless
C: TRISHA
D: No! You're not!
E: catching on
C: JANE
D: Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an affair with Agness Adler's husband.
N: The Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself.
C: TRISHA
D: That. Is. Genius!
C: JOANNE
D: But also sort of wrong.
C: JANE
D: I know.
C: DIANE
D: Oh, please. Not that wrong.
C: JANE
D: I know! I'm so happy to be able to tell someone. This is the most out of control thing I've ever done. Literally. You know me.
C: DIANE
D: Yes we do. You don't do anything wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I kinda love it.
C: JOANNE
D: He was yours first.
C: JANE
D: True. Not that I want him back by the way.
C: TRISHA
D: Of course not. You can do better than Jake.
C: JANE
D: Thanks.
E: a little insulted
C: TRISHA
D: I mean you've outgrown him. You've blossomed, you feng shuied your whole life... Just please, don't let him talk you into saving him.
C: JANE
D: I won't...
E: wonders what that means
C: DIANE
D: There is something kinda perfect about this. You don't have to cook for him or clean up after him or actually even sleep with him....
C: JANE
D: Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits...
C: JANE
D: But, girls, what about the fact that I'm now the other woman? I'm the one we hate.
E: CONT'D
C: TRISHA
D: Oh, forget that. Agness is still the one we hate. Even in this scenario.
C: DIANE
D: Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch on this one.
S: INT. BAKERY KITCHEN - DAY
N: Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper. Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a tray of cookies out of the oven.
C: JANE
D: Reynaldo, I'm changing the breakfast menu, want to give it a little more life... What do you think?
E: shows it to him, he seems distracted
C: REYNALDO
D: -- What'd you do? Something to your hair?
E: distracted
C: JANE
D: I don't think so.
C: REYNALDO
D: Something about you looks different. Little more "caliente."
C: JANE
D: Caliente?
N: Another Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement.
C: REYNALDO
D: You see it Eddie?
C: EDDIE
D: Whatever it is, it's workin'.
N: He winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter. Jane blushes as her cell phone rings.
C: JANE
D: Hello. No! I didn't do this again!
E: listens
S: EXT. JANE'S OPEN FIELD - LATE DAY
N: CAMERA MOVES IN on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of the field. Jane's addition is staked out with orange tape. REVERSE - ON JANE Rushing toward Adam.
C: JANE
D: Adam, I'm so sorry. My mind is just... Forgive me.
C: ADAM
D: If I were your shrink I'd say maybe you don't really want to build this house.
C: JANE
D: That's completely not true. I'm really sorry. Oh! I like it already!
E: looks at taped off addition
C: ADAM
D: Yeah, it's feeling really good. So, this becomes your office. We come down your new hallway, the windows are all along here...
C: JANE
D: Great. Love it.
C: ADAM
D: And from here to there...wait, let me get the door for you... Your kitchen. We're in the eating area. How's the size? We're at either end of the table.
E: opens a piece of tape they ENTER pretends to sit
C: JANE
D: Feels perfect.
E: laughs at Adam
C: ADAM
D: I thought so too.
C: JANE
D: This is heaven!
E: taking it all in
C: ADAM
D: It's gonna be cool. Want to go upstairs?
N: JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS
C: ADAM
D: So if you were lying in bed, this would be your view.
N: Jane breaks into a smile. THEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses, then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance. Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her.
C: ADAM
D: You okay?
C: JANE
D: Yeah.
E: grabs her heart
T: CUT TO:
N: WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET
S: INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness calling his name in anger. He leaps.
C: JAKE
D: Coming!
N: Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at him.
C: PEDRO
D: What were you doing in there?
C: JAKE
D: Going to the bathroom.
C: PEDRO
D: The toilet didn't flush.
C: JAKE
D: Yes it did.
C: PEDRO
D: Why were you in the shower with your clothes on?
C: JAKE
D: What are you talking about?
E: making sure Agness doesn't hear
C: PEDRO
D: I heard the shower door close.
C: JAKE
D: What do you have, x-ray ears?
N: Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking through. She holds a broom.
C: AGNESS
D: What's up Pedro?
C: PEDRO
D: Jake took a shower with his clothes on.
C: JAKE
D: Pedro! Darling...
C: AGNESS
D: What's he talking about?
C: JAKE
D: I don't speak Pedro. That's your department.
C: AGNESS
D: Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke something. Yo. Can you help?
E: to Pedro to Jake, annoyed
N: Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake.
T: CUT TO:
N: TWO GORGEOUS CROQUE-MONSIEURS - COMING OUT OF AN OVEN These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are carried to Jane's counter. We're:
S: INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING
N: Jane very professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two waiting plates, adds some salad on the side. Adam stands nearby with a glass of wine, jacket off.
C: ADAM
D: That looks amazing.
C: JANE
D: It's called a croque-monsieur. It's one of the first things I learned to make when I lived in Paris because the ingredients are really really cheap.
C: ADAM
D: When did you live in Paris?
C: JANE
D: In my early twenties. I went there to take a six day pastry class and ended up staying a year working as an apprentice in a bakery. Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass.
C: JANE
D: Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails and turning them into something so beautiful.
C: ADAM
D: You are rapidly becoming one of the most appreciative clients I've ever had...
C: JANE
D: Well, I'm not all that used to being able to count on anyone...
C: ADAM
D: Really?
E: surprised by that
N: JAKE DRIVING - SAME TIME He squints, looking ahead, SEES: JANE'S HOUSE - ALL LIT UP And Adam's car parked out front. Jake turns OFF HIS HEADLIGHTS, slowly pulling around to the side of the house.
S: INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
C: JANE
D: I know it's none of my business but... I'm trying to figure out why someone like you is divorced.
C: ADAM
D: And what'd you come up with?
C: JANE
D: Something in the you're too nice department..?
C: ADAM
D: Yes, that and my wife fell in love with my best friend. Ex-best friend.
C: JANE
D: Oh, no!
C: ADAM
D: We were all on a biking trip, he and his wife, me and my wife...through Tuscany and on the last day of the trip they announced they were in love.
C: JANE
D: That's awful.
C: ADAM
D: Yeah. Not a great plane ride home.
C: JANE
D: I can imagine, sitting there for eleven hours with your wife who you know is -- oh, that's rough.
C: ADAM
D: Actually they went on to Venice and I flew back with Carol, his wife. You can't imagine what it's like to sit next to someone who's been crying for ten straight hours.
C: JANE
D: I don't blame her.
C: ADAM
D: I was talking about me. Anyway, they're married now and it's pretty much an ongoing awful thing. But, you and your ex... When I saw him stop by for a cup of coffee the other morning, I thought -- Wow! That's the way it's supposed to be. You two seem to have it all figured out.
C: JANE
D: We're not as figured out as you'd think.
S: EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn, careful not to be seen.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Jane clears their dishes.
C: JANE
D: You know I hope you don't feel I've been interrogating you, but... JANE I know what it's like to have your ex remarried and to not have so much going on in that department. I mean, do you date ever or...
E: laughs MORE cont'd
C: ADAM
D: Uh, constantly actually.
C: JANE
D: Constantly?
C: ADAM
D: Everyone I know or have ever known has fixed me up. And then, sometimes I just meet women, I don't know how that happens, but...
C: JANE
D: -- But no girlfriend?
C: ADAM
D: Not yet.
N: Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.
C: JANE
D: Just like to date...
C: ADAM
D: Actually, I find it really stressful. You know, the last time I was in the dating world was 1978. It's a little more complicated these days. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off. Not to mention, a home cooked meal that no one else I know could possibly cook.
N: Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that. She smiles, wiping the counter.
C: ADAM
D: That was a compliment. So you don't have a guy in your life at the moment?
C: JANE
D: No.... No.
E: starts to say something.
C: ADAM
D: No?
S: EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window. He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet, he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.
S: INT. JANE'S HOUSE - A BIT LATER
N: Jane walks Adam to the door. He holds rolled blueprints.
C: ADAM
D: This was so nice and relaxing and the lavender ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort I've ever had... like, in my life.
C: JANE
D: Aw, thank you. I always make ice cream when I can't sleep, so I'm glad someone was here to eat it.
E: opens door
C: ADAM
D: Great getting to know you a little.
E: pauses...
C: JANE
D: It was really fun.
E: nods
N: Adam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward. Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR.
C: JANE
D: Woops! Coming!
N: Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find: JAKE leaning in the door frame.
C: JAKE
D: O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave. Hello Jane, you look very beautiful tonight.
E: entering
N: He takes her in his arms.
C: JAKE
D: Mmmmm. Love when you smell like butter.
C: JANE
D: What are you doing here?
E: easing away
C: JAKE
D: Missed you.
C: JANE
D: It's nine o'clock. Where does your wife think you are?
C: JAKE
D: At yoga. Shall we do some downward facing dog?
C: JANE
D: Not tonight big guy.
N: They CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS.
C: JAKE
D: Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes? I won't think less of you, you know.
C: JANE
D: Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I was just gonna take a bath.
C: JAKE
D: Good. So, we'll just hang out. Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur? Who's plate is this? Yours or his?
E: now IN THE KITCHEN, he SEES the dinner dishes on the counter
C: JANE
D: Mine.
C: JAKE
D: Oh my God, just as I remember it.
E: eats her leftovers, savors the taste
C: JANE
D: Don't you ever eat at your house?
C: JAKE
D: Pedro dictates all meals and he has a very limited palate. What kind of ice cream is that?
E: sees melted ice cream
C: JANE
D: Lavender Honey.
C: JAKE
D: Not sleeping?
E: immediately
C: JANE
D: Not at all. You?
C: JAKE
D: Never slept better. And my digestion is finally back on track. You've turned my world right side up, Jane. You know what this means, don't you?
C: JANE
D: No...
C: JAKE
D: That I've never really known how to live without you.
S: INT. JANE'S BATHROOM
N: Jane takes a bubble bath. Jake lies on the floor, leaning against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream.
C: JAKE
D: Maybe we should be growing old together.
C: JANE
D: Hate to tell you, big guy, but we already grew old apart.
C: JAKE
D: What's with the `big guy'? Is that because you think I'm fat or is it a term of endearment?
C: JANE
D: I have no idea why I keep saying that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.
C: JAKE
D: Thank you. I love how quiet it is in your house. I have no quiet in my life. Ever.
E: then
C: JANE
D: Yeah, well, you live with a five year old.
C: JAKE
D: Yes...and don't forget Pedro.
N: Jane splashes him.
C: JANE
D: So what does that mean exactly...? What's going on over there at your place?
C: JAKE
D: My marriage is... not turning out as I hoped. That's obvious.... Agness started out really looking up to me... We never used to fight but now... with the kid....lately we're all about where he's gonna go to school and now she says we need a bigger house, more help. I was thinking of cutting back at work... now that's never gonna happen. And she wants another baby before Pedro gets too old which I get but since we're always fighting... oh, God, listen to me.
C: JANE
D: Isn't a baby part of the deal when you marry a woman that age?
C: JAKE
D: Is it? I guess so. She's got me booked at the fertility center every other day and she's so amped up on hormone injections I may need to find an exorcist if she doesn't calm down. I wish it was funny. Incredible ice cream. I'm turning around... Remember when we used to smoke pot and eat your ice cream in the hot tub?
E: Jane laughs finishes his ice cream as he turns, Jane shrinks in the tub
C: JANE
D: The "hot tub"... That feels like a billion years ago.
C: JAKE
D: How long has it been since you...
E: indicates smoking a joint
C: JANE
D: Me? Since before Lauren was born.
C: JAKE
D: 27 years?!!
C: JANE
D: At least.
N: Jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it.
C: JANE
D: Are you kidding me? Put that away! It's been too long...
C: JAKE
D: Exactly.
C: JANE
D: I'm not going to....
C: JAKE
D: Okay, why don't I leave this with you... Maybe you'll take a few hits... JAKE get your sea legs, then we'll smoke the rest of it together.
E: It's kind of amazing. MORE cont'd
C: JANE
D: Maybe....
N: Jake places the joint in a drawer.
C: JAKE
D: So that nerdy architect likes you...you know that, right?
C: JANE
D: He's not nerdy and he definitely doesn't. We're working together.
C: JAKE
D: I was watching when you bent down to open the oven, his eyes were glued to your ass.
C: JANE
D: Hey, will you do me a favor?
E: changing the subject
S: INT. FOYER
N: Jake is on a small ladder, changing a light bulb in the chandelier. Jane, in a robe, stands beneath him.
C: JAKE
D: Tell the truth, Janey is this a great affair, or what?
E: looking down at her, smiles
C: JANE
D: I don't know. It's my first.
C: JAKE
D: We don't even have to have sex and it's fun. I wish I could sleep over.
E: climbing down arrives next to her
C: JANE
D: I gotta tell my shrink about this. This is a lot to handle. I guess you should go ... I'm sure yoga's probably closed by now. JANE Oh, you got a little ice cream on your shirt. Let me get that out.
E: MORE cont'd
C: JAKE
D: It's okay...
N: Jake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug. He lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin. She kisses him on the cheek. He slides her robe off her shoulder. He softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way up her neck. Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling.
C: JANE
D: Wow, wow, wow...what's happening, Jake?
N: The Phone RINGS. Jane pauses.
C: JAKE
D: Don't get it.
C: JANE
D: I always get it. I have three kids. Hello. Hiii... You still on the plane? How was Luke when you left? Oh, that sounds like fun. Let me know what I can bring..... No! Don't have any idea where he is. Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow. Now I'm lying...... Lauren and Harley are giving Luke a graduation party this weekend. Sweet, huh?
E: Jake wishes she wouldn't. She hesitates, picks it up makes an I told you so face points to Jake hangs up
N: Jake's CELL PHONE RINGS, sees it's Lauren calling.
C: JAKE
D: Hello stranger. Welcome back.
E: into phone
N: Jane OPENS THE DOOR and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and then EXITS toward his car. They wave to one another.
C: JAKE
D: -- Just getting in my car. This weekend? Sounds great. Let me know what I can bring...
E: into phone
N: Jake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless. Jake shrugs. Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his cell.
S: EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - EARLY MORNING
N: Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from her bakery. She's clearly waiting for someone. She spots a comfortably dressed MAN IN HIS MID FORTIES holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the building's entrance.
C: JANE
D: Dr. Allen!
E: approaching him
C: DR. ALLEN
D: Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today?
E: surprised to see her
C: JANE
D: No, I just need to talk...and I was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session. I'm sort of desperate for some advice. I brought you some of that coffee cake you like. Not as a bribe or anything...
C: DR. ALLEN
D: I only have twenty minutes until my first patient.
E: checks his watch
C: JANE
D: That's fine. I'll talk fast.
S: INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor.
C: JANE
D: So, at this point, I just need some sound, unbiased guidance. Is having an affair with you know who a good thing or a bad thing? It's a bad thing, right? How could it be good?
E: whispering they stop at Dr. Allen's office door
C: DR. ALLEN
D: It's not good. It's not bad.
E: opening his door
N: Oh, man. Not what she needs to hear.
S: INT. OFFICE
N: Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair. Dr. Allen turns on a few lamps as his dog settles.
C: DR. ALLEN
D: You know, things happen in life and our job is to find out why. What we have to do is take a real look at this. Are you ready to do that?
C: JANE
D: I am. Definitely. I've made a list of what this can possibly be about...at my end. Can I read it to you?
C: DR. ALLEN
D: Of course.
E: taking his seat
C: JANE
D: Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself. Okay. Am I still trying to figure out why the marriage failed? Do I want to get back together? Do we have unfinished business? Is this about revenge? Am I just... lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker" thing? JANE You know, the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden Jake's back and I get to take care of him in some way...
E: digging out her Blackberry reads from Blackberry MORE cont'd
N: Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.
C: JANE
D: And, listen, I get how therapy works, I do... We look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what....? we're going on eight years, right?.... and I'm okay with that, I like it... but in this case, I need to know what you really think. Like, I'd like you to say... Don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine. I actually want to be told what to do.
C: DR. ALLEN
D: What's interesting is I'm already seeing you open up more than I have in some time. I'm thinking, through this affair, you may learn to view the world in a different way.
C: JANE
D: I'm sorry. I need more concrete. Are you saying I should keep seeing him? Because, honestly, if the guilt and fear could go away, maybe I could let go a little and figure this out.
C: DR. ALLEN
D: I wouldn't resist looking at this.
C: JANE
D: Okay... and another way of saying that is....?
E: mulls that over quickly
C: DR. ALLEN
D: Let go Jane. It can't hurt. Jane fist pumps in the air.
S: INT. SANTA BARBARA FERTILITY CENTER RECEPTION - DAY
N: Jake is in the Waiting Room with several other "Older" Men all with their much younger Wives. A Nurse ENTERS, holding a chart.
C: NURSE
D: Jacob Adler? Jake rises. One of the younger women whispers...
C: WOMAN
D: Have fun...
S: INT. FERTILITY CENTER OFFICES
N: The Nurse shows Jake into a windowless room with a sink, a pleather barcalounger, a TV and a DVD player.
C: NURSE
D: Okay, you know the drill. You can hang your things in the closest, the remote is on top of the TV and the materials are in the drawers. Please deposit your specimen in the cup and I'll see you when you're done.
E: cleaning the remote with an anti-bacterial wipe
N: She dims the light before leaving. Jake takes off his jacket, tosses it on the chair, slips off his shoes, takes off his pants, sits for a sec when his PHONE RINGS. He looks at the name of the caller. Smiles.
C: JAKE
D: Hi.
N: JANE WALKS QUICKLY THROUGH A FARMER'S MARKET ON HER CELL.
C: JANE

C: JAKE
D: At the office.
C: JANE
D: Want to grab some lunch?
C: JAKE

D: See you there, Adler.
C: JAKE
D: She's comin' back!
E: hangs up

C: HARLEY
D: Sure, if nobody wants to sit down... -- Hey, there's your...

E: starts to turn
N: Harley grabs Lauren's face in his hands and kisses her, even though he's choking. He coughs while kissing her.
C: LAUREN
D: Harley!!!
C: HARLEY
D: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spit on you. I just needed to kiss you.
C: LAUREN
D: While you were choking?
C: HARLEY
D: It worked. I'm not choking anymore.
N: Harley swallows a cough, reaching for his water, HIS EYES ON JAKE as Jake is HANDED A ROOM KEY and POINTED TOWARD THE ELEVATOR. Harley drinks his entire glass of water as he watches.
C: LAUREN
D: Who did you just see?
E: turning
N: Luckily Jake is now gone.
C: HARLEY
D: No one. Thought it was your cousin...but...
N: Harley falls silent as he SEES JANE ENTER THE HOTEL AND CROSS TO THE RECEPTION DESK. After a sec, she's pointed toward the same elevator.
C: HARLEY
D: Ohhhh my sweet Lord....
C: LAUREN
D: Now what?

C: HARLEY
D: Honey, I totally forgot I have a conference call at 1:15, I gotta get back to the office. Waiter! Honey, stop eating, get the waiter. Call the one over there.

S: INT. JAKE AND JANE'S HOTEL ROOM - UPSTAIRS - SAME TIME
N: The curtains are drawn, the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel robe, slips a cd in the cd player and we hear a mellow song, perfect for love in the afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS and Jake EXITS, also in a hotel robe. Jane stands across the room from him. They smile at one another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and back. They smile at one another, then something comes over Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses against the wall.
C: JANE
D: Jake!!!
S: INT. LOBBY CAFE - SAME TIME
N: The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's table. She holds a binder filled with photos. Harley is a mess, knowing what's going on upstairs.
C: WEDDING SPECIALIST
D: I adore October weddings. Let me show you what we did last October.
N: She opens her Book of Photos for Lauren. Lauren gasps.
C: HARLEY
D: Honey, I'm gonna make that phone call from the...
E: rising
N: Lauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't hear him. They keep talking to each other.
C: HARLEY
D: -- Okay. Good. You just keep doing that and I'll... They still don't look up. Harley nervously HEADS FOR THE LOBBY when he spots the HOTEL DOCTOR, bag in hand, arriving at the Reception Desk.

C: RECEPTION CLERK
D: 408. Adler. His wife said he's conscious now...

N: Harley stops in his tracks, freaking. Adler???
S: INT. JANE AND JAKE'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed.
C: HOTEL DOC
D: Your blood pressure's good.
C: JANE
D: How's his heart?
C: HOTEL DOC
D: Do you have a heart condition, Mr. Adler?
C: JAKE
D: No. And I just had a check up.
C: JANE
D: You did? Oh, that's good.
C: HOTEL DOC
D: Deep breath. So, no chest pain?
E: listening to his heart
C: JAKE
D: None.
C: HOTEL DOC
D: When you got dizzy, did you feel your heart was beating funny?
C: JAKE
D: Yes, but I was admiring my beautiful...
E: indicates Jane
N: Jane holds up her weak eyelid.
C: HOTEL DOC
D: -- Well that's nice to hear after all these years... Did you forget to take any of your medications today?
E: winds up his stethoscope
C: JAKE
D: Took `em all.
C: HOTEL DOC
D: What all did you take?
C: JAKE
D: Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin.. Flomax.
E: whispers
C: JANE
D: Flomax?
E: sitting on the bed
C: JAKE
D: Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a day.
E: embarrassed
C: HOTEL DOC
D: How long have you been taking the Flomax?
C: JAKE
D: Not that long. And I only take it sporadically. I have to sneak it actually. It reduces semen and that's not good for my wife right now. Sorry.
E: explains confidentially to Jane
C: HOTEL DOC
D: Really..?
E: looks over at Jane
C: JANE
D: Yes, I prefer a lot of semen. Always have. Okay, well, thank you so much for coming. Looks like he's gonna live, so...
E: rises
C: HOTEL DOC
D: Yeah, my guess is Flomax is probably the culprit here. It can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure so I suggest you stay off it for a few weeks, which apparently your wife will appreciate.
E: packing up holds in a chuckle
C: JANE
D: Yeah. Really good for me.
N: The Doctor snaps his bag shut, rises.
C: HOTEL DOC
D: And I suggest you rest quietly for the rest of the afternoon. No hanky panky, Mrs. Adler.
E: to Jane
C: JANE
D: No chance. I assure you.
S: INT. LOBBY
N: Harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs. Lauren arrives, joins him on the bench.
C: LAUREN
D: Are you acting like this because of the wedding? Tell me the truth?
C: HARLEY
D: Not at all. Swear to God.
E: head down
C: LAUREN
D: Because I don't want to be one of those couples where the guy goes into a coma the whole time we plan the wedding. It's not worth it to me.
N: Harley looks up, sees the Hotel Doc walk by the Reception Clerk. The Doc gives her a wink and a "thumbs up" and keeps on walking.
C: HARLEY
D: Okay! We're back in business!
E: deep sigh, rises
N: OPRAH - CLOSE - ON TV In Jane and Jake's room. REVERSE - JANE AND JAKE Sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating chicken soup on trays. Jake reaches for the salt. Jane eases it away from him. Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with love and appreciation.
C: JAKE
D: See. Just that move...you have no idea. Not everyone's like that...
C: JANE
D: Jake, I have a confession to make. Back when we broke up... I knew it wasn't all your fault.
E: mutes Oprah, then:
C: JAKE
D: You mean that? You've never said that to me before.
C: JANE
D: I know. Because when you cheated, I didn't have to. But I think in some way, I gave up on us and I'm not sure you ever really did.
C: JAKE
D: I still haven't.
N: Jake takes Jane's hand. She looks down at his wedding ring, then turns her eyes back to Oprah. A beat, then:
C: JANE
D: Are you and Agness... still having sex?
N: Jake doesn't answer. Jane turns, looks right at him.
C: JAKE
D: Only if she initiates it.
N: Jane GROANS.
C: JAKE
D: I'm trying not to rock the boat at home until you and I figure this out. This is a little trickier at my end than yours.
E: sees her reaction
C: JANE
D: Right. Yeah. Okay.... Now I know you're gonna think I'm leaving because of what you just said, but I'm not. I really have to get back to work.
E: rises...
C: JAKE
D: We got really close there for a moment.
E: takes Jane's hand
N: She knows he's right. Jane's Cell RINGS. She lets it ring again, then answers it.
C: JANE

E: into phone
N: ADAM - AT HIS OFFICE
C: ADAM
D: Hi, hope I'm not interrupting anything.
E: into phone
T: INTERCUT JANE AND ADAM
C: JANE
D: Adam! Oh! Hi.
N: Jake is instantly jealous. He rises, crosses to the closet, starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very engaged by Adam.
C: ADAM
D: I just found out there's a French Film Festival in town and that made me think of you so I was wondering if you'd like to go to the opening night tomorrow night.
E: a little nervous... will she accept?
C: JANE
D: Oh, that sounds so fun... Let me think, tomorrow's what?
E: Jake rolls his eyes
C: JAKE
D: -- Say you're busy. Agness has a dinner thing tomorrow, I can come over. Please.
E: desperate, whispers Jane hesitates
C: JANE
D: Oh, um, you know, I'd really love to, but, my son is coming home from college the next day and I have a bunch of things I have to do to get ready... I'm so sorry.
E: hates lying, Jake crosses to her, smiles
C: ADAM
D: No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe we can see something another night.
C: JANE
D: Absolutely. I would love that. Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her.
C: ADAM HANGS UP
D: We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker.
C: ADAM
D: Melanie, how would you and your husband like two tickets to the opening of the French Film Festival? Reserved seats...VIP parking...
C: FEMALE WORKER

C: AGNESS
D: Why do you think I cancelled my dinner?
N: Agness pulls her t-shirt over her head... she is gorgeous.
S: INT. PEDRO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him. Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes. Jake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding onto his hand.
S: EXT. JANE'S PATIO - NIGHT
N: Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by room, the house becomes dark.
S: EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - 6 P.M.
N: The Kids cars are in the driveway.
S: INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME
N: Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking, setting the table, opening wine, chatting.
C: LAUREN
D: -- Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to tell you about our meeting at The Stanhope. We went there for lunch two days ago and met with their Wedding Specialist....I think that could be the place, Mom....
C: JANE
D: Two days ago you went to The Stanhope...for lunch?
C: HARLEY
D: Yes and guess what? We saw nothing. Jane and Harley connect. He immediately looks away.
C: LAUREN
D: What is that supposed to mean?
C: HARLEY
D: Who wants wine? Anyone?
E: starts pouring
C: GABBY
D: Mom, you have an insane amount of food in here, even for you.
E: looking in the fridge
C: JANE
D: I knew you were all going to be here for the weekend so I made a bunch of stuff last night.
E: taking out last night's roast chicken
C: LAUREN
D: Looks like Jake Adler's favorite meal to me.
C: JANE
D: Very funny.
E: laughs
C: HARLEY
D: Very. Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.
C: JANE
D: Harley? Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up.
C: JANE
D: Yay!!!!
E: hugs Luke
C: LUKE
D: Mom, this looks amazing.
E: surveying all the food
N: Harley and Luke hug, talk the talk. `Sup? Yo...
C: JAKE
D: Hi.
E: sheepishly joins the group, eyes on Jane
C: JANE
D: Hey.
E: briskly
N: Harley takes a huge gulp of his wine.
C: JAKE
D: Where should I put this...?
E: holding Luke's backpack
C: JANE
D: Wherever.
E: turns her back on him, making herself busy
N: Harley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them. He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs. Jane slices the roast chicken.
C: JAKE
D: That looks incredible. Jane looks up at him, knife poised. Is he kidding?
C: JANE
D: Thanks.
N: She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg. Jake flinches.
C: HARLEY
D: Jake? Glass of wine?
C: JAKE
D: Uh, sure. Thanks.
C: HARLEY
D: Jane?
C: JANE
D: No thank you.
E: not looking up
N: Jake's cell RINGS. He turns his back to take it.
C: JAKE
D: Hi Ag... Just got here.
E: into cell
N: Jane has a hot flash. Starts fanning herself.
C: JAKE
D: Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know. I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it.
E: into cell turns back to the family
C: JANE
D: Bye-bye.
N: The Girls look to Jane.
C: JAKE
D: I have to stop at the market. Agness is making some pasta thing and she ran out of olive oil.
C: GABBY
D: Hey, at least she's finally cooking.
C: JAKE
D: So...see everybody at the party tomorrow...
C: LAUREN
D: Yeah. It's gonna be so fun.
C: JANE
D: I told you I'm bringing someone, right?
E: to Lauren
C: LAUREN
D: No. Who?
C: JANE
D: Adam. My architect.
C: JAKE
D: You're bringing your architect?
C: JANE
D: Yes I am.
C: JAKE
D: Like as a date?
C: JANE
D: Yeah.
E: looking right at him
C: GABBY
D: I like the idea.
C: JANE
D: Me too.
C: HARLEY
D: Yeah, seems like it should round out everything really nicely. Nobody wants wine but me?
E: pouring another drink
N: Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands it to Jake.
C: LUKE
D: Here, now you can stay another five minutes. You have three bottles in there.
E: catches Jane's eye
C: JAKE
D: Janey, can I talk to you privately? Just for a sec.
N: Jane heads out still holding the carving knife. Harley slips the knife out of her hand.
C: HARLEY
D: There you go.... Somebody's talkin' graduation gift.
E: to Kids
S: INT. COURTYARD
N: Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room.
C: JANE
D: What is it, Jake? What?
C: JAKE
D: I don't get not calling me back.
C: JANE
D: `Cause I don't care what your excuse is.
E: shuts the door to the living
C: JAKE
D: She didn't go out, Jane. She cancelled her plans and every time I tried to call or write, she caught me. I wanted to be here.
C: JANE
D: You know what, Jake? You were worried about rocking the boat at home? Well now you're rocking my boat and I don't like it.
C: JAKE
D: Honey, don't let one night...
E: stopping her
C: JANE
D: You don't understand. I'm not even blaming you. I fully participated in this. But I don't want to do it anymore. The last thing in the world I should be right now is your mistress, sitting around at nine at night wearing heels and perfume and blowing out candles and wrapping everything in Saran Wrap because your wife cancelled her plans. It was cliche and humiliating.
C: JAKE
D: You lit candles?
E: wistfully
C: JANE
D: Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a pretty good life these past 10 years. I figured it out and I moved on. I no longer feel alone or divorced. I just feel normal. You know how long that took, just to get my balance back?
C: JAKE
D: No.
C: JANE
D: The point is, I'm going in the wrong direction here. But the worst part is... It's feeling like it used to feel. All the little untruths that are hard to catch but add up...
C: JAKE
D: -- Janey, c'mon, it was one mistake...
C: HARLEY
D: -- Everything okay out here? The kids are gettin' hungry...
E: joining them Jane and Jake turn
C: JANE
D: Yeah. We're done. We were just...
E: walks away, pauses in front of Harley
C: HARLEY
D: -- None of my beeswax, Jane. And please never tell me.
E: as she passes once she's gone
N: Lauren joins.
C: LAUREN
D: What's up?
C: JAKE
D: Nothin', punky.
E: rubs her arm
C: LAUREN
D: Yeah? So, we're going to see you tomorrow night, for sure, right? Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt sleeve.
E: taking Jake back inside
C: JANE
D: Okay...What did you see and what do you know?
C: HARLEY
D: Nothing. Really. Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.
C: HARLEY
D: Okay, he checked in, you arrived, you met in the elevator, possible kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor came down, thumbs up. That's it. Have no idea what happened in between.
E: confesses rapidly
C: JANE
D: Have you told Lauren?
E: dying...
C: HARLEY
D: No and I won't --
C: LUKE
D: Mom. Dad's leaving...
E: joining them
S: INT. HOUSE
N: Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table which now has dinner on it. Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the others who are about to sit down for dinner.
C: LUKE
D: Thanks for picking me up, Dad...
E: from the Dining Room
N: Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then heads out.
S: EXT. HOUSE
N: Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He heads toward his car as... JANE glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...
S: A80 EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - THE NEXT NIGHT A80
N: Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks. OMIT
C: IN THE BATHROOM
D: Jane sits at her dressing table, dressed for the party. She puts on hoop earrings -- likes the way she looks. She opens a drawer to take out a lipstick.
N: INSERT - THE DRAWER Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her. She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror. ADAM - WALKING UP THE PATH TO THE HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER He looks adorable and carries a gift the size of a book. He knocks in a playful rhythm. JANE ANSWERS THE DOOR all smiles.
C: JANE
D: Hey....
N: REVERSE - ON ADAM Very happy to see her.
C: ADAM
D: Hey. You look fantastic.
C: JANE
D: I'm feelin' a little fantastic.
N: She OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER and we NOW SEE she's eating a gi-normous piece of cake.
C: ADAM
D: This is for you.
E: trying not to react to that, ENTERS, handing her the gift.
C: JANE
D: Really? Thank you! Come on in. Can you hold this for a sec? Oh my God... -- this could be the best cake I ever made. You want a piece? It's like... beyond...
E: takes a huge bite of cake hands him the cake plate takes another bite
C: ADAM
D: I think I'm good.
C: JANE
D: I can't believe you brought me a gift?! So nice!
E: focusing on the gift
N: Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it.
C: JANE
D: An appointment book?
C: ADAM
D: I sort of assumed you didn't have one.
C: JANE
D: --Because I never remember our... Awww....
C: ADAM
D: I took the liberty of filling in our next two meetings. And marked them with post-its and wrote them in red and then highlighted them in neon yellow.
C: JANE
D: Thank you!
N: Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the kiss lands on his lips.
C: JANE
D: Sorry.
C: ADAM
D: I'm not. Wow, that cake is good.
E: Did he really say that? Then, he licks his lips
N: Jane laughs a little too hard.
S: INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
C: JANE
D: So, let me ask you something and please don't think I'm weird or out of line or anything... but do you by any chance poke smot?
C: ADAM
D: Do I...??
C: JANE
D: I mean do you smoke pot?! I haven't asked anyone that question since I was twenty-two.
C: ADAM
D: Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But I don't think I've had any since my kids were born...so not in like 27 years.
C: JANE
D: Oh my God, we have kids the same age! And I haven't had any since my kids were born either!!! Except for tonight. I had one hit off of this.
N: Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up next to a Police Car.
C: ADAM
D: You might not want to hold that quite so... Hello Officer.
E: nods
C: JANE
D: I actually know him! Blueberry scone and a latte. Oh my God! That was horrifying. I instantly saw myself in a mug shot. My heart is leaping out of my... Wow... This is the most insane dashboard I've ever seen. It's like we're in a cockpit. It's spectacular. Adam, what kind of car is this?
E: turns, SEES the Cop Car, GASPS and DROPS THE JOINT, then TURNS to Cop, waves, then: the Cop nods, pulls away then distracted
C: ADAM
D: Jane?
C: JANE
D: Hi.
E: turns to him
C: ADAM
D: Did you get this high from one hit?
C: JANE
D: Yes! I don't know what they've done to pot over the last 30 years but it rockkkkks!
S: EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
N: From OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room. Candles dot the path up to the cottage door. Several Couples and College Kids are walking toward the house. ANGLE - BEHIND NEARBY BUSHES Jane and Adam are sharing the joint. Jane takes a tiny, lady- like hit, passes it to Adam.
C: JANE
D: Don't take too much, it's really strong.
E: whispers
N: She blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a huge hit.
C: ADAM
D: I haven't had fun in almost three years, Jane. Bring. It. On.
E: while holding in the smoke takes another huge hit
N: SOME COLLEGE KIDS walk past the bushes.
C: KID
D: Who's got the reefer?
C: ADAM
D: No one. Keep walking please.
E: O.S. fake falsetto
N: The Kids laugh.
S: INT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups, ENTER the party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.
C: JANE
D: How you feeling?
C: ADAM
D: Totally fine.
C: JANE
D: Me too.
N: Adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just insanely. Lauren and Harley greet them. Jane greets them back with a huge hug.
C: JANE
D: Hi... love your dress. Hey Harls.
C: HARLEY
D: Harls...?
E: that's weird...
C: JANE
D: Adam, this is my oldest, Lauren and her fiance, Harley. We're on a date.
E: giggles to Kids
N: Adam and Jane stifle laughs. AT THE BAR - WIDE - MOMENTS LATER Jane and Adam chat with all the Kids. Looks like it's going great -- Adam is a big hit. ON JAKE - WATCHING FROM ACROSS THE ROOM Jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy. He sees the Kids disperse, finishes off his vodka, ready to make his move. ON JANE AND ADAM Now alone. They haven't seen Jake yet.
C: ADAM
D: By the way -- How great is this party? Let's be the last to leave. (bops to the MUSIC then
E: starts moving to the music - Jane laughs
C: SPOTS JAKE ACROSS THE
D: ROOM, seriously eyeing him.) ADAM Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh. He's headed right toward us. Not the time to be "feeling groovy" Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?
E: MORE cont'd dances again when he sees Jake in SLOW-MO getting closer and closer
N: Adam slides a bit behind Jane as Jake arrives with Agness who looks inappropriately youthful.
C: JAKE
D: Hello Jane.... Adam.
C: ADAM
D: Hey, good to see you again.
E: all smiles
C: JANE
D: Adam, this is Agness, Jake's wife... Now that is an odd sentence for me to say since that was me for most of my life. Seriously. How weird is that? Both of us married to the same man!
E: suddenly realizing
C: AGNESS
D: You know... it's... hey, what are you gonna do?
E: dismissing the idea
C: JAKE
D: Yeah, why go there.
N: At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the giggles. As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight face.
C: JANE
D: Because there, is...fascinating. I mean, when you think about it, it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of all the men on the planet, we both said "I do" to this guy.
C: AGNESS
D: Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I know you're having like an "Ah-Ha' moment, but I think I'm gonna get a refill. Adam, good meeting you.
C: ADAM
D: She's got a really scary tattoo.
E: whispers to Jane as Agness exits
C: JAKE
D: Janey, can I talk to you for a quick sec?
N: Jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it. Jane looks to Adam.
C: JANE
D: He always needs me for a quick sec. You okay?
E: starts to exit
C: ADAM
D: Oh, I'm very okay!
S: INT. TINY BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER
N: Jane and Jake are crammed into an extremely tight space.
C: JAKE
D: What's going on? You're acting insane.
C: JANE
D: I'm stoned.
E: whispers giddily
C: JAKE
D: What?! You smoked the joint I gave you?
C: JANE
D: You told me to! It's a-mazing!!!
C: JAKE
D: But you weren't supposed to smoke it with him, you're supposed to smoke it with me!
C: JANE
D: Somebody's jealous....
C: JAKE
D: Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I be... you're my...
C: JANE
D: -- What? What am I, Jake?
C: JAKE
D: You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest friend and girlfriend.
N: Jane blurts out a laugh.
C: JANE
D: Okay. You're hilarious. And because of that, even though I kind of hate you/love you, I'm going to let you have some...
C: JAKE
D: You love me? I mean, I heard "hate" had top billing, but...
N: Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke.
C: HARLEY
D: Oh my God, you're smoking weed in the guest bathroom.
C: JAKE
D: Yes we are and we'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this.
C: HARLEY
D: No. Never. Adding it to the list.
C: JANE
D: Care for a toke?
C: HARLEY
D: I don't really smoke marijuana.
C: JANE
D: Me either.
E: blowing out smoke
C: HARLEY
D: Okay, one hit.
C: JANE
D:  JANE Oh, my God. Is that what I look like?
E: looks at herself in the mirror MORE cont'd
S: EXT. BACKYARD PATIO - MOMENTS LATER
N: A small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio. Adam and Agness are dancing together. They're totally into it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends and The Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice" begins. Jake follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her. Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their parents.
C: LAUREN
D: They must be hammered.
C: HARLEY
D: Or something like that.
N: Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake.
C: ADAM
D: Sweetest divorced couple in the world..!
E: to Agness
N: Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane.
C: JANE
D: Hey..! Jake, I'm gonna.... Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look back at Jake again.
E: spotting Adam to Jake
N: Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away. Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it.
S: INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
N: Adam drives Jane home. Clearly the end of a great night.
C: JANE
D: Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it?
C: ADAM
D: You know what's great?
C: JANE
D: What?
C: ADAM
D: How much I like you.
C: JANE
D: Thank you... I really like you a lot too.... even though...oh.. you didn't say, "a lot".
E: really touched
C: ADAM
D: But I was thinking it.
C: JANE
D: So... I'm not too old for you?
C: ADAM
D: How can you be too old for me when I'm older than you.
C: JANE
D: I just figured all these women you get fixed up with are thirty-five.
C: ADAM
D: Your age is one of my favorite things about you. Do you think you have any more of that chocolate cake at your house?
E: she appreciates that
C: JANE
D: Hungry?
C: ADAM
D: Starved!
N: A BLACK SCREEN - LIGHTS POP ON And we are IN THE BAKERY at ONE A.M. Jane turns on a few more lights, but keeps it a bit moody.
C: ADAM
D: Officially now the best date of my life. Pre or post divorce.
C: JANE
D: Get out... All right....so basically I can make you anything on the menu or even not on the menu. Just name it.
C: ADAM
D: No? Really? Okay. What about a... warm chocolate croissant?
E: scans the blackboard menu
C: JANE
D: My speciality!
N: OMIT
S: INT. BAKERY KITCHEN
N: JANE FLOURS AND ROLLS CROISSANT DOUGH as Adam, now in an apron, watches, chatting with her. Jane then places the dough in a machine called a Sheeter. The dough slides into the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter. ANGLE - JANE AND ADAM - TWO STONERS watching the sheeter, mesmerized. NEXT Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard stick, then cuts it into sections. She takes one of the sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts it into triangles. She's a whiz at this. THEN, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then, Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each triangle and roll it into a croissant. Laughing as they work, they make a dozen croissants... NEXT...into the OVEN.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - LATER
N: Jane and Adam sit at a table in the corner, a stack of croissants piled high between them. Music plays as Adam takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next.
C: ADAM
D: Oh. Baby.
E: bites into it
C: JANE
D: Mmmmmmmm.
E: smelling hers
C: ADAM
D: It's crazy how good this is.
C: JANE
D: Yeah, and I'm not even stoned anymore.
E: biting into one, nods
C: ADAM
D: Neither am I.
C: JANE
D: Oh, then...merci, Monsieur.
E: happy about that
C: ADAM
D: Do you remember when I asked you the other night, if you were dating anyone and you said no... It sounded to me like you were maybe saying yes.
C: JANE
D: I was sort of seeing someone. But, it's over now. Honestly.
E: Adam nods
C: ADAM
D: `Cause I'm not strong enough to fall for someone who's with someone else. Wouldn't be able to take that again.
C: JANE
D: I understand. I wouldn't say it was over if it wasn't.
N: Adam takes Jane's hand in his...relieved.
C: ADAM
D: Great. Adam turns Jane's hand over and looks at it a bit quizzically.
C: JANE
D: Cooking scar.... From a very hot batch of caramel...
E: explains
C: ADAM
D: Ooooo. What about that one?
C: JANE
D: That one's from boiling sugar...I wasn't very skilled in the beginning. And that one is from a large French...
N: Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar.
C: JANE
D: -- Saute pan.
N: Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as Adam moves closer.
C: ADAM
D: Would it be okay if I...?
N: Jane nods. He kisses her great.
C: ADAM
D: I was going to say, kiss you.
C: JANE
D: I figured.
C: ADAM
D: If you feel this is in any way wrong because we're working together...
C: JANE
D: ... I don't ...
N: He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and kiss again. OMIT
S: INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY
N: Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt and boxers.
C: JANE
D: Hey sleepy! What time did you get in?
C: LUKE
D: Have no idea. Lauren and Harley drove me home.
C: LAUREN
D: I'm surprised you remember that.
E: joining
C: JANE
D: Hi. I didn't know you slept here.
E: turns to see Lauren
N: Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top, takes out a box of cereal.
C: LAUREN
D: We were playing Scattagories with Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell asleep on the couch.
N: Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt.
C: LUKE
D: Sweet.
C: HARLEY
D: I got cold in the middle of the night.
N: Lauren and Jane laugh.
C: JANE
D: Okay, who wants what? Hi baby...
E: noticing Gabby entering
C: GABBY
D: What's Dad doing here?
E: looks out the front window
N: Everyone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his Porsche.
S: EXT. FRONT PORCH
N: Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are all open.
C: JANE
D: Everything okay?
E: quietly
C: JAKE
D: I left Agness.
C: JANE
D: No, don't say that.
C: JAKE
D: She saw it my eyes, Janey.
C: JANE
D: Saw what?
C: JAKE
D: That I'm still in love with you. I admitted it, I told her about us and I've left her. For you.
C: JANE
D: No, no, no.... What do you mean??? Jake, this is crazy! Are you telling me the truth?
E: worried the kids will hear, whispers
C: JAKE
D: This feels so right Jane.
E: nods
N: As Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her PJ's, looking confused.
C: GABBY
D: What's going on?
E: from the porch
C: JANE
D: Nothing. Honey, set the table, I'll be right in.
C: GABBY
D: Mom, you're the only one who cares if the table's set.
C: JANE
D: Okay, then do it for me....just go in please.
N: Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch.
C: LUKE
D: What's up, Dad?
C: JAKE
D: Having some problems on the home front, just wanted to talk to your Mom for a sec.
N: Jane shakes her head. Why did he have to say that? Harley joins the Kids.
C: LAUREN
D: Problems on the home front? Is one of you seeing someone else?
N: Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.
C: JAKE
D: No, it's nothing like that. I just need to find a hotel or something for a few days `til I get my head together.
E: off Jane's cue
C: GABBY
D: It's that serious?
N: Jake nods.
C: LUKE
D: Mom, can Dad stay here for a few days? He can share my room.
C: JANE
D: I don't think that's the best idea, Luke.
C: GABBY
D: Daddy, are you crying?
N: ON JAKE - TEARS WELLING UP He turns away from the kids. The tears could be for dramatic effect, could be real.
C: JAKE
D: I'm sorry.
N: All Three Kids immediately well up and look at Jane.
C: LUKE
D: Mom........
E: begging
S: EXT. FRONT PORCH DINING AREA - A LITTLE LATER
N: Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been lifted. His energy is in full bloom.
C: JAKE
D: Mommy's the best cook in the world!
S: EXT. VEGETABLE GARDEN - LATER THAT DAY
N: Jane is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her. She looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking across his face.
C: JAKE
D: Thank you for saving me Janey.
C: JANE
D: Jake, you knew the kids were all here. Shouldn't we have talked about this? Agreed this was the right thing to do? This is so typical. Only thinking about works for you.
C: JAKE
D: I'm sorry, I guess I should've called before showing up.
C: JANE
D: -- And I'm not sure you even left Agness. Maybe she saw something last night and threw you out...
C: JAKE
D: What's the difference? I was drowning over there. I'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out. Janey, let's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work.
C: JANE
D: We can't, Jake. I told you this the other night. Please listen.
C: JAKE
D: But you were all pissy because you thought I stood you up. Things are different now. I'm a free man. Can we just hug? I hate that you're being so distant. It's literally giving me a pain in my stomach.
E: then
C: JANE
D: Oh, God...
N: Jane reluctantly hugs him. He tries to kiss her.
C: JANE
D: See! Too much!
C: JAKE
D: Okay! Good note.
N: Jane can't help but smile.
C: JAKE
D: Can I help with what you're doing? Hold your basket or...
C: JANE
D: I'm fine....
C: JAKE
D: Okay... I'm going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight. We'll have movie night. Just like old times. How's that? I'll make the popcorn. Just then Jane's Cell RINGS.
C: JANE
D: Fine. Hello...
E: into phone
C: JAKE
D: I love knowing I'm coming back here.
E: whispers
C: JANE
D: Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout you?
E: nods, turning slightly
N: Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back.
S: INT. FAMILY ROOM - JANE'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT
N: The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low. Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls. ON THE FLAT SCREEN - BUCK HENRY AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN
C: BUCK HENERY
D: Are you here for an affair, sir?
C: DUSTIN
D: What?
C: BUCK HENRY
D: The Singleman party, sir?
N: Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing. He catches Jane's eye and mouths.
C: JAKE
D: I'M SO HAPPY!!!
S: EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT - EST. INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the fridge.
C: JAKE
D: Any leftovers?
C: GABBY
D: Are you kidding?
E: takes out an armful of Tupperware
C: JAKE
D: Any of that noodle thing left? Where's Mom? She disappeared so fast after the movie.
E: Gabby hands it to him.
C: GABBY
D: She's probably sleeping.
C: LUKE
D: I think she's on her computer.
N: They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various counters.
C: LUKE
D: Tonight was weird.
C: GABBY
D: So weird. Still is.
C: JAKE
D: I loved tonight.
C: GABBY
D: Yeah. That's why it was so weird. Just seeing you in your robe in our kitchen. Remember when you weren't even allowed in. Mom used to go out to the car to talk to you...
C: LUKE
D: You know, I don't even really remember you and Mom as a couple.
E: handing Gabby his Tupperware
C: JAKE
D: What do you mean... you were ten when we broke up.
C: LUKE
D: I was eight actually and I don't know...it's all foggy to me now.
C: JAKE
D: You don't remember us in Hawaii or all sleeping in that tent in the backyard.
C: LUKE
D: Yeah, of course, but I don't remember like you and Mom hugging or waking up together...
N: Jake grabs his heart, moans.
C: LUKE
D: -- It's okay. I'm not damaged or anything. You've been good parents...
C: GABBY
D: Speak for yourself dude. I'm definitely damaged from the divorce.
N: Harley and Lauren ENTER. Lauren turns the tea kettle on.
C: LAUREN
D: Hello troops.
C: JAKE
D: Why are you still here?
C: LAUREN
D: I don't know, you and Mom sleeping in the same house. Harley thought we should stay.
N: Jake turns his beams on Harley.
C: HARLEY
D: She exaggerates. I just thought perhaps you might want to talk later, or ... Is that the noodle thing?
C: JAKE
D: Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.
C: GABBY
D: Dad!
C: JAKE
D: I didn't know anyone wanted any.
S: INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR.
C: JANE
D: Wait, I can't see that one. Can you back up a little?
N: CLOSE ON JANE'S LAP TOP SCREEN - ADAM IN HIS BEDROOM He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski sweater.
C: JANE
D: Very festive...
E: hmmm
C: ADAM
D: O-kay. Thank you. Gift from my ex-sister-in-law. Have no idea why I kept it. Into the pile. Hey, check out the pile, Jane.
E: into lens pulls sweater off
N: Adam POINTS HIS LAPTOP to the floor to show a HUGE STACK OF OLD CLOTHES.
C: JANE
D: Nice! Hey, the pile's moving....
E: then
C: ADAM
D: Murphy, get out of there!
N: A small Mutt scurries out of the pile. Jane laughs.
C: ADAM
D: What about this? I was in India and I had it made. ADAM The guy ran out of fabric so he didn't make me long sleeves. Or short sleeves. It's weird.
E: re-enters in an odd shirt MORE cont'd looks down
C: JANE
D: And kinda girly.
C: ADAM
D: Not what I'm going for. Gray sweater. Very old.
E: taking it off holds up a sweater
C: JANE
D: But cute.
C: ADAM
D: You sure? You don't have to say you like it just because you nixed the last 20 things.
E: slips it on
N: Jane likes this man.
C: JANE
D: Keep it. It's cozy. Boy, you have a lot of clothes.
C: ADAM
D: Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're almost done. You are helping me so much by the way.
E: looks at the floor
C: JANE
D: -- Adam, I really have to pee.
C: ADAM
D: Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in thirty.... Putting this on my desk....
E: lifting the laptop
N: ON JANE'S SIDE Just a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed.
C: JANE'S VOICE
D: I'm not in there...
N: ON ADAM'S SIDE - AN ISIGHT FRAME OF AN EMPTY DESK CHAIR.
C: ADAM'S VOICE
D: Can't hear you.
S: INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - WIDE - SAME TIME
N: Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly, quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE -- elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He changes his smile to a smoulder. Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered. JANE A104 dries her hands at the bathroom sink. A104
S: INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
N: Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop. JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. Simultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust.
C: ADAM
D: Mother of -- Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
E: looks again
N: Jake LOOKS DOWN AT THE SCREEN, SEES ADAM'S SCREAMING FACE AND SCREAMS BACK.
C: JANE
D: What are you doing in here?!!!
C: ADAM
D: Get it off!!!
E: covering the screen with his hands
C: JAKE
D: I wanted to see you.
E: covering himself
C: JANE
D: Why are you naked!?!
C: JAKE
D: Why do you think?
E: sits up straight, the lap top shooting even more directly at his groin
C: ADAM
D: Okay, I'm gonna be sick.
N: Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of course, does nothing.
C: ADAM
D: Not working! Big close up!
N: Jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to get his robe.
C: ADAM
D: Okay! Good night!
N: Jake SPINS THE LAPTOP and the ISIGHT LENS LANDS ON JANE. Jane and Adam look at one another. No time to say anything. She's desperate. He's lost. The DOOR FLIES OPEN, the KIDS RUSH IN, just as Jake ties his robe.
C: GABBY
D: Everybody okay?
N: No one says anything.
C: LAUREN
D: What's happening?
N: Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.
C: JAKE
D: Okay. Let me explain. The reason I left Agness wasn't just because my marriage wasn't working. I've also fallen in love...back in love... with your mother. Or maybe I never stopped loving her.
E: The Kids wait...
C: GABBY
D: Is this a joke?
C: JAKE
D: I know this is shocking, but I think this is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Your Mom and I have been seeing each other, on the side... ever since New York.
C: LAUREN
D: Mom, is this true?
C: JANE
D: That part is, but..
E: dying
C: JAKE
D: I found my way back home. I just hope she'll take me back.
N: Gabby breaks down in tears. Lauren puts her arm around her. Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A CLICK and THE LAPTOP SCREEN GOES BLACK.
C: JAKE
D: Why's everyone crying? Why isn't this good news?
C: LAUREN
D: Because we're still getting over the divorce.
C: LUKE
D: Mom, are you and Dad getting back together?
C: JANE
D: No... we're not.
N: Jane looks at the Kids with incredible sadness.
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER - THAT NIGHT
N: The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the house. Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before feeling quite like this. Jake EXITS THE HOUSE, holding his bag. He stops, looks at Jane. She has nothing left to say. Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks back inside. OMIT
S: EXT. POOL AREA/BACKYARD - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
N: Jane lies on a pool chaise, wrapped in a blanket, tissues in hand. She stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter shut, we drift off of her...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: OMIT
S: EXT. JANE'S POOL/BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING
N: CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS THE POOL TO JANE, asleep on the pool chaise, still wrapped in a blanket. The sprinklers go off and wake Jane. She opens her eyes, looks around, realizes she's spent the night outside. Jane sits up too fast, a tad disoriented, then quickly realizes what she must do. A FRONT DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL HARLEY bed-headed and still in his pj's. He approvingly looks at Jane, who stands across from him, ready to right it all.
C: HARLEY
D: Glad you're here, boss.
S: INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Harley leads Jane down the narrow hall to the Bedroom.
C: HARLEY
D: Now I know you don't need my advice Jane, but...
C: JANE
D: I got this one...
C: HARLEY
D: I know you do. Jane pauses, Harley nods for her to go inside.
N: JANE'S POV - INSIDE THE BEDROOM Her Three Kids are under the covers. Lauren is between Gabby and Luke. They look like they just woke up. Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at her children.
C: JANE
D: Knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible... and sometimes over the years, I've thought that your Dad and I weren't quite finished. And, as it turns out, we weren't. So I went out of my comfort zone, which, I found out, if you're really honest with yourself, isn't all that comforting. So, I experimented with a part of myself. I wanted to find out if, after all these years there was still something there between us.
C: LAUREN
D: And was there?
C: JANE
D: There kinda was.
N: Lauren smiles with her eyes.
C: GABBY
D: But Mom, you have to understand how bonkers this sounds to us. For two people who for years couldn't be in the same room together...to then have an affair??? You and Dad...!
C: JANE
D: I know...it was hard for me and I was doing it. I hope you'll forgive me for confusing you or betraying your trust, but I did this for me and for him and I realized even though your Dad and I once had something extraordinary... we no longer really fit together. But he is a part of me and always will be.
C: LUKE
D: So it's over now? You guys are back to being divorced.
C: JANE
D: For better or for worse.
N: Lauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on the other side of the bed, holding back tears.
C: HARLEY
D: Group hug?
N: And as they all move into hug, we:
T: CUT TO:
S: A MOVING POV - INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY
N: REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam's firm. She arrives at:
C: ADAM'S OFFICE
D: Adam is on a phone call.
C: ADAM
D: Yeah no problem...we can definitely do that... -- James, can I call you back, someone just... Thanks. Hi.
E: into phone notices Jane rises
C: JANE
D: Hi. May I come in?
C: ADAM
D: -- Sure.
C: JANE
D: I didn't call you last night because I wasn't sure you would take the call and then I thought that could go on for months and...
C: ADAM
D: -- I would have taken the call.
C: JANE
D: Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to say these things in person. Adam, the man I was seeing was...
C: ADAM
D: I think I'm up to speed on that part.
C: JANE
D: I want you to know it didn't last long and you're divorced, so maybe you understand, when marriages end, there's doubts and hurt, and you've got kids and sometimes you wonder if you did the right thing and when the moment presented itself...
C: ADAM
D: -- I get it. I could imagine it...I could...
C: JANE
D: I told him it wasn't going to work between us but I guess he didn't believe me and unbeknownst to me, he showed up at my house yesterday. He left Agness and...
C: ADAM
D: -- Jane. I actually think I understand what happened but...uh...you know I'm not as macho as I appear and I think it's probably best for us not to get any more... involved because your relationship with Jake isn't really done and I know you're saying it is, but he's in love with you and for everyone's sake, that should probably get resolved.
C: JANE
D: Wow. So that's how grown ups talk.
N: Adam smiles.
C: JANE
D: Please tell me you're not going to quit my job and ask Peter to take over because then I'll never get to see you and...
C: ADAM
D: I was thinking of asking Peter to step back in.
C: JANE
D: Oh... I hope you don't...
C: ADAM
D: Thanks.
N: OMIT
S: EXT. ROAD TO JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
N: Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard. Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.
C: JAKE
D: I'm sorry.
N: Jane doesn't answer right away.
C: JANE
D: How far back does that sorry go?
C: JAKE
D: How far back do you need it to go?
C: JANE
D: Way back.
C: JAKE
D: Consider it an all inclusive apology. From not being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last night.
C: JANE
D: Yeah, what were you thinking with that move?
C: JAKE
D: That you'd find me irresistible.
N: Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.
C: JAKE
D: Never considered the alternative.
C: JANE
D: Gotta love that about you.
N: They swing some more.
C: JAKE
D: Oh, man, can't believe I got up to bat again and blew it.
C: JANE
D: You didn't blow it. We blew it. We blew it the first time around. This time... we just should've known better. Too much has happened. Too much time has passed.
C: JAKE
D: And you don't think we could make it right?
C: JANE
D: Does that mean you didn't feel it was totally right either?
C: JAKE
D: Being with you Jane is the best I'm gonna be.
C: JANE
D: But do you agree that it wasn't really...?
C: JAKE
D: It was complicated.
C: JANE
D: Begging for an answer.
C: JAKE
D: I thought it was good. I wanted it to be good.
C: JANE
D: Guess that's as close as I'm gonna get.
C: JAKE
D: Do you always have to be so hard on me?
C: JANE
D: No. I don't.
C: JAKE
D: I don't regret giving it another shot.
C: JANE
D: Probably would've been better if you hadn't been married.
C: JAKE
D: It may never have happened if I wasn't married.
N: Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side by side, as they sway in the breeze.
C: JANE
D: I don't regret it either.
N: They continue rocking, not much more to say. As CAMERA PULLS AWAY, we:
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - MANY MORNINGS LATER
N: It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps. Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is stunned he's there.
C: ADAM
D: Good morning.
C: JANE
D: Good morning.
C: ADAM
D: Did you know it's good luck to start building in the rain?
C: JANE
D: Really?
C: ADAM
D: Yes. It's a well known, very good, really lucky omen.
E: obviously lying
N: Thunder rattles the sky.
C: JANE
D: Good, I could use one. Would you all like to have your meeting in the house...it's dry and I've got hot coffee...
E: looking up then
N: The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before someone talks.
C: ADAM
D: Jane, I need to ask you something...
C: JANE
D: Anything...
C: ADAM
D: You wouldn't happen to have any of those amazing chocolate croissants, would you?
C: JANE
D: Oh.... you like those, huh?
C: ADAM
D: I have incredibly fond memories of them.
C: JANE
D: I don't have any here, but we could go into town and get some... right out of the oven. They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:
C: ADAM
D: You want to do that?
C: JANE
D: Yeah... love to. And as they walk away from Camera, we:
T: SLOWLY FADE OUT
