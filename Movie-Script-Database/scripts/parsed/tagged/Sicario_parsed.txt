N: A MAN, standing waist-deep in the surf. White shirt, neck tie, hair perfectly parted. Wire framed glasses rest on the bridge of his nose. His name is ALEJANDRO. He rises his face to the sun.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I think about the price. The price of appetite. The cost of forgetting who we are. Pretending we are... who we will never be...
E: V.O.
N: He looks young for 35, but his eyes -- seems they lived for decades before him. He closes them, bathing his face in sunshine.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: So easy to pretend we are not to blame. That a demon enters us. No... The demon is inside. We just make potions that release it.
E: V.O.
N: The muscles of his neck tense.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: There's no revenge for all they have taken. No justice. It simply is...
E: V.O.
N: His lip curls. His eyes open. He looks down.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: And still. They must be forced to look at all they have destroyed. By having the same done to them. Or they will forget... Forget they are human. Believe they are as different as they feel... Then they are the lion, and everything we loved and lost, simply its meal.
E: V.O.
N: We hear SPLASHING and the panicked gasps of a man trying not to drown. Only now do WE SEE: Alejandro is holding someone under the water. He lets the drowning man catch a breath, barely. Pushes him back under. Looks out. Lost in thought. We watch from the beach as Alejandro stands in the ocean to his belly, the sun high overhead.
T: CUT TO:
N: YESTERDAY. -- FRAME IS FILLED WITH A BLUE EYE, AS BLUE AS THE OCEAN -- The eye blinks, and we can almost feel a breeze -- we are that close.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come...
E: Whispered
N: A VERTICAL LINE OF WHITE LIGHT invades us, then grows. The eye disappears in it's wake.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
E: CONT'D
N: TWO DOORS swing open. We see the silhouettes of TWELVE PEOPLE DRESSED FOR BATTLE, rifles at the ready, barrels pointing up. CAMERA is so close to the woman's face, it almost touches her. Her lips are moving, silently reciting... We are in a SWAT ASSAULT VEHICLE. It is MOVING BACKWARDS fast and slams through a faded picket fence. Stops in the yard of a crumbling house. They all rise and leap from the vehicle.
S: EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- PHOENIX -- DAY.
N: WE ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE WOMAN, who mumbles the prayer as she runs. The back of her vest reads: FBI. Her name is KATE MACY.
C: MACY
D: Give us this day... our daily bread...
N: They reach the door, a shotgun BLASTS THE HINGES. It falls like a drawbridge.
C: MACY
D: And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
E: CONT'D
N: She speaks the prayer faster, desperate to finish before she has to kill anyone, or be killed herself.
C: MACY
D: And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil...
E: CONT'D
N: SWAT officers rush in, screaming. Macy's turn: She runs through the busted door-
S: INT. TRACT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.
N: In the hallway now. The chaos is closer. She hurries the words. So close now...
C: MACY
D: For Thine is the Kingdom the power and glory forever and ever amen DOWN MOTHER FUCKER!! DOWN DOWN DOWN!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Two LATINO MEN, 20'S, are slammed to the ground. Another LATINO comes from nowhere, throwing himself on an AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN wearing an FBI vest. A taser is pressed to his neck and he falls, paralyzed, backward. Macy takes in the chaos, then pushes farther into the house, running past a bedroom with an open door. From the corner of her eye she sees: A MAN POINTING A SHOTGUN AT HER. She ducks as a SHOTGUN BLAST rips 10 inches of dry wall above her. She turns, pressing the CAMERA against the wall. We watch over her shoulder as she returns fire. A rooster tail of shell casings are thrown over us, invading our view. Bullet after bullet pound him. The man's knees give. He's falling... A round hits him in the face and he is thrown back -- blood, brain, and skull fragments explode like shrapnel on the wall behind him. Adrenaline hits her like a fever. She gets dizzy, sits against the wall, gasping for breath. A SWAT officer rushes to her.
C: SWAT OFFICER
D: YOU HIT??
C: MACY
D: I'm good. I'm good.
N: The SWAT officer looks at the hole in the drywall. Leans forward. Looks closer... What the fuck IS that?? His face now inches from the hole then jumps back like he was bitten by a snake.
C: SWAT OFFICER
D: WHAT THE FUCK??
N: WE SEE WHAT HE SEES: The SKULL OF A MAN. Dry skin sunken into bones like cellophane. Macy stands up and turns around. Looks at it. Trying to process what she's seeing. She walks up and starts pulling at the drywall. Other officers join her. They yank and tear a six foot hole in the wall, then stand back, speechless. Bodies are standing side by side. A lime-green dust has spilled out on the floor. The entire house is a tomb.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- LATER.
N: Macy sits on the porch. Swallows water from a bottle. Holds it down maybe ten seconds. Vomits... We see another SWAT OFFICER doing the same. FBI AGENT REGGIE WAYNE, 30, African American, walks from the house, fighting the same urge. Sits beside her.
C: MACY
D: Can't shake the smell. Just sits in you.
C: REGGIE
D: Yeah... Sorry I wasn't on your six. Got wrapped up in the front room.
N: Macy nods.
C: MACY
D: I saw.
N: She looks out over the sea of POLICE VEHICLES on the street and spots PHOENIX HOMICIDE DETECTIVE LANCE ALVAREZ, 45, heading right for them.
C: LANCE
D: Loan you SWAT and you hand us three dozen homicides. I oughta fucking pepper spray you.
C: MACY
D: Couldn't smell any worse.
C: LANCE
D: Ha ha. You're not the one gotta clean this shit up.
C: MACY
D: Yeah. Thirty families without a father's real funny, but you keep worrying about what it does to your weekend, Lance.
C: LANCE
D: Listen you fucking --
N: Reggie is on his feet in an instant and inches from Lance's face.
C: REGGIE
D: I didn't hear you, you say something?
N: Lance swallows his anger and his pride, walks toward the house.
C: LANCE
D: Clear your people out, it's our crime scene now.
C: MACY
D: It's your crime scene when I GIVE IT TO YOU!!!
C: REGGIE
D: What are the chances they'll put together a case.
C: MACY
D: ... None.
C: REGGIE
D: Look.
N: She turns and sees: FBI REGIONAL DIRECTOR DAVE JENNINGS, 50, leather skin stretched over a square jaw that rests on broad shoulders. Beside him is DEPUTY DIRECTOR PHIL COOPER, 40, balding and thin, exactly the man you want analyzing data.
C: REGGIE
D: Ever seen him at a crime scene?
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: No.
N: Jennings and Phil reach her.
C: JENNINGS
D: You okay?
C: MACY
D: I'm fine.
C: MACY
D: Wanna give me the tour?
E: CONT'D
N: She doesn't but she will.
S: INT. TRACT HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS.
N: No dry wall anywhere now: the walls have been stripped to the frame, exposing another DOZEN BODIES. CORONERS in protective suits remove them as DETECTIVES photograph the scene. The smell is atrocious.
C: PHIL
D: Looks like Sinaloa...
N: Jennings nods and sighs.
C: JENNINGS
D: Yeah. How many total?
E: To a coroner
C: CORONER
D: Between here and the hall we have thirty, but there's more in the back bedroom and we haven't looked in the attic or under the crawl space.
C: JENNINGS
D: Call DOJ in Washington, let em know what we have.
E: To Phil
N: Phil nods, pulls his cell and steps away.
C: JENNINGS
D: This one of the houses owned by Manuel Diaz?
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: No way to connect him, but he owns it.
N: The smell is getting to Reggie. Doesn't look like he's going to make it...
C: MACY
D: Go ahead and step out, it's okay.
E: CONT'D
N: Don't have to tell him twice. Jennings walks to the wall. Studies the faces -- one in particular, tinted an ashy green from lye and months of decay -- his mouth open wide and eyes shut so tight that his brow is a tangle of wrinkles, as though he is suffering his death for eternity.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT.
N: We see a GARAGE, and to it's left A STORAGE SHED. AN OFFICER yanks boxes and garbage from it, tossing it on the driveway. He reaches the floor, which is covered with rubber matts. He pulls one up and discovers a 3' X 3' piece of plywood hinged to the floor and locked.
C: OFFICER
D: I NEED BOLT CUTTERS.
N: They are brought over and the lock is cut. The officer kneels down. Lifts the hatch a little. Looks under, flashlight in hand... -- WE ARE UNDERNEATH THE PLYWOOD, FLASHLIGHT IN OUR EYES -- As the hatch is lifted -- TWO HOOKS with wires are visible to our left and right. As the hatch is lifted, the wires pull tighter... We see where they lead: TWO GRENADES.
S: INT. TRACT HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- CONT.
N: Jennings and Macy walk down the hall. Jennings stops at the body of the man Macy killed, then notices -- Through a screen door at the end of the hall -- officers rushing toward the shed.
C: JENNINGS
D: PD found something.
N: Macy and Jennings walk outside. As the sunlight hits them, the officer open the hatch, the wires pull tight and we hear a `clink'. -- THE GRENADES EXPLODE. TWO OFFICERS BLOWN TO OBLIVION -- Dust, debris, smoke, and pieces of them roll toward Jennings and Macy like a wave, swallowing them. Our entire world is filled with a brown cloud and screams...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MANUEL DIAZ'S HOUSE -- DAY.
N: We see children splashing and playing in a large pool through enormous windows in MANUEL DIAZ'S living room. As we pull back, we hear the sounds of a NEWS REPORT.
C: NEWS REPORTER
D: Phoenix police have released no details, but there HAS BEEN an explosion at a house in South Phoenix.
E: V.O.
N: CAMERA PIVOTS and we are looking at a TV across a flawlessly decorated living room. Aerial footage of the tract house and obliterated storage plays.
C: NEWS REPORTER
D: You can clearly see two bodies covered in tarps but Phoenix Police will not release names or even confirm the deaths. Witnesses on the scene state that a warrant was served at the house an hour BEFORE the explosion, so the speculation is the deceased are Phoenix police OFFICERS --
E: V.O.
N: A MAN leans into frame. His head slowly shakes as he watches and listens. A cell phone rings. He answers it, mutes the TV, and retreats out of frame, leaving us to watch the news in silence, as the sounds of children splashing and laughing wafts in through an open window.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT.
N: We stare at the spout. Water washes over us. We look at the drain. Dirt, blood, and small fragments of pink, white, and navy blue circle the drain as gravity carries them to the sewers of Phoenix. Dark brown hair is vigorously scrubbed. Macy does not relax in this shower-- that is not its purpose. The purpose is to decontaminate.
S: INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Macy stands in front of the mirror, brushing her hair. There are abrasions on her cheek and a deep cut that runs down from the corner of her eye-- like she cried a scar. The hair brush catches. Pulls her head back.
C: MACY
D: OW.
N: She extracts the brush. Feels around on her scalp and retrieves a piece of bone. Looks at it... She wraps it in toilet paper, sets it on the counter, and gets back in the shower. Turns it on. Gonna try this again...
S: INT. MACY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT.
N: The decor is Spare. Functional and nothing more. Doesn't even tease herself with pictures on the wall. Macy walks in wearing a large men's t shirt, nothing else. Her COMPUTER CHIRPS. ROSALYN4620 is asking that she chat. Macy looks at the screen.
C: MACY
D: Not tonight mom.
E: CONT'D
N: Keeps walking. Her cell phone rings. Call display: MOM.
C: MACY
D: Uhh... Mom, it was a REALLY TOUGH--
E: CONT'D Answers it
C: ROSALYN
D: Everyone sure missed you today.
E: V.O.
N: Macy's body tenses and deflates at the same time.
C: MACY
D: Me too. You get my card?
C: MOM
D: Get on the computer. I want to see YOU--
E: V.O.
C: MACY
D: Mom, I just got --
C: MOM
D: It's my birthday goddammit-
E: V.O.
C: MACY
D: I'm signing on.
N: She hits a button on her computer and ROSALYN MACY, 60 today, appears. She leans back and forth in front of the lens, still unsure about this technology that beams her image through space.
C: MOM
D: Can you see me?
C: MACY
D: Stay in one place, Mom. Happy birthday. Sorry I didn't call-
C: MOM
D: Can you see me? I don't see you. Lean forward -- there you are... What happened to your face?
N: Rosalyn's happy mood is gone.
C: MACY
D: Nothing. It's something on your lens.
C: MOM
D: Kate. I can see it.
C: MACY
D: Like I said, rough day.
N: Silence.
C: MOM
D: What a waste of a law degree, Kate.
N: Macy holds her tongue, but it takes effort.
C: MACY
D: Who came to the party?
C: MOM
D: Evan sent me a card. I thought that was very sweet. Have you two spoken?
N: Macy sighs.
C: MACY
D: No.
C: MOM
D: Well... I hope you two will become friends.
C: MACY
D: I'm sure we'll be great friends, Mother. Nothing like a divorce to bring people closer.
N: Beat.
C: MOM
D: You look tired.
C: MACY
D: I am... Happy birthday. How does it feel to be 60?
E: forces a smile
C: MOM
D: It would feel a lot better with a grandchild, and I don't think it's UNREAS--
N: Macy slams the laptop closed. She rubs her eyes... So tired. Her cell phone rings. She flips it open, angry --
C: MACY
D: I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN. Yeah, umm... I can, I can be there in, say thirty minutes? Yes sir.
E: It isn't mom
N: Hangs up. Day's not over.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOMELAND SECURITY COMMAND CENTER -- PHOENIX -- NIGHT.
N: Macy and Reggie sit in chairs against a glass wall. NEWS FOOTAGE of the blast plays on monitors along the wall of a command center filled with activity. In the glass office behind them, a dozen men in suits. Jennings, in the same shape as Macy, has deflated into a chair, Phil sitting beside him. Macy turns and looks through the wall at the men.
C: REGGIE
D: Know what's going on?
C: MACY
D: No idea.
N: Jennings makes eye contact with Macy through the glass. For the first time, he seems old to her. All these men look important, except one: MATT GRAVES, 40, golf shirt, bit of a belly, red, shaggy hair -- looks like a tourist. His demeanor is easy, you almost get the sense he's having fun. Macy turns around and rests her head against the glass.
C: MACY
D: I need coffee.
E: CONT'D
C: REGGIE
D: We did this by the book, right?
C: MACY
D: Come on ... Of course.
N: Macy lets out a heavy breath, looks back through the glass to find: every man in the room is STARING RIGHT AT HER.
C: MACY
D: Jesus.
E: CONT'D
C: REGGIE
D: What? Oh shit.
E: Turns around
N: Phil walks toward them, pushes open the door.
C: PHIL
D: Would you step in here, Kate?
N: She rises and shares a look with Reggie. The door closes behind her.
S: INT. GLASS OFFICE -- CONT.
N: Matt smiles, friendly. A man in his 40's, military haircut, BURNETT, looks her over.
C: BURNETT
D: Quite a find today ... The loss of two officers not withstanding.
N: She says nothing.
C: BURNETT
D: How familiar are you with Manuel Diaz's operation?
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: His company, Sun Valley, owns eighty or so foreclosure properties, another --
C: MATT
D: What do you know about his brother?
N: She looks at Matt.
C: MACY
D: Um ... Wasn't aware he had one.
C: MATT
D: Guillermo... Mexican police are holding him in Juarez. What do you know about his cousin?
N: Beat.
C: MACY
D: Didn't know he had one of those either.
C: BURNETT
D: His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.
N: Beat.
C: MACY
D: I don't know who that is.
C: MATT
D: Number three in the Sinaloa Cartel.
C: BURNETT
D: Manuel Diaz is likely their most senior member in the United States.
N: Macy feels woefully unprepared for an inquisition.
C: MACY
D: None of this is in his file.
C: BURNETT
D: With good reason.
C: MATT
D: Loose lips sink ships, Kate.
C: MACY
D: I'm not --
C: JENNINGS
D: Agent Macy doesn't work narcotics, she runs a kidnapping response team.
C: MATT
D: You married?
C: MACY
D: I'm sorry?
C: MATT
D: Husband?
N: Who the fuck is this clown in the golf shirt?
C: MACY
D: Divorced.
C: MATT
D: Kids?
C: MACY
D: No. He works for Border Patrol and got to keep the condo and my Bronco, anything else?
N: Matt smiles. Phil stands up.
C: PHIL
D: Thank you Kate, if you could wait outside, please.
N: She stands there for a beat, utterly confused, then leaves. She sits back down next to Reggie.
C: REGGIE
D: ... Well?
C: MACY
D: I have no clue.
N: We watch the men speaking through the glass, then they all file out of the office except Jennings and Matt. Phil stands at the door.
C: PHIL
D: Will you come in, Kate?
N: She walks in and stands across from Jennings.
C: JENNINGS
D: DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz. This is Matt Graves. He'll be LEADING --
C: MACY
D: He'll be leading who? This is Phoenix Homicide now.
C: MATT
D: We're expanding the scope of the investigation.
C: PHIL
D: You'll act as a liaison.
C: MACY
D: What does that mean?
C: PHIL
D: State Department is pulling an agent from the field that specializes in responding to escalated cartel activity. You'll meet up with them... at Luke, Tomorrow?
E: To Matt
C: MATT
D: Day after. Early.
C: MACY
D: Luke ... Air Force base?
C: MATT
D: Gonna go see Guillermo.
C: MACY
D: His brother.
C: MATT
D: That's the one.
N: Matt smiles, like they're discussing renovating a kitchen.
C: MACY
D: Okay... If I, umm... What's our objective?
C: MATT
D: Our objective is to dramatically overreact.
N: Beat.
C: MACY
D: Why isn't Reggie in here?
C: MATT
D: He's a little green. You've been kicking doors longer.
N: She looks back at Reggie.
C: MATT
D: Makes you feel better to have him around, he can tag along after we get back from El Paso.
E: CONT'D
N: He smiles. She takes this in.
C: JENNINGS
D: Kate. You must volunteer for an interagency task force... Think very hard before you respond ... You want to be a part of this?
N: Jennings' eyes beg her to say no. But the hunter in her is awake. She looks back at Reggie -- his eyes are full of concern...
C: MACY
D: We get an opportunity at the men responsible for today?
C: MATT
D: The men who are REALLY responsible.
C: MACY
D: Then yeah, sure. I'll volunteer.
N: Jennings looks at her. Nods. She is theirs now...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TINY HOUSE -- NOGALES, MEXICO -- DAY.
N: Morning sun hits closed eyes. Dark, fat face. Beads of sweat on his brow and cheeks. Thick mustache. His name is SILVIO. A SHADOW falls over him. He feels it. Eyes pop open, tense.
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: Papa?
N: A smile crosses Silvio's face.
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: Despirtate.
E: CONT'D
C: SILVIO
D: No.
N: Silvio closes his eyes. The little boy taps him on the chest.
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: Si.
N: Silvio's smile grows. It is a game.
C: SILVIO
D: No.
N: We see the boy now. He is eight. Bright brown eyes. His name is ELISEO.
C: SILVIO
D: SI!! Tengo un juego de futbol!
E: CONT'D
N: Silvio acts surprised.
C: SILVIO
D: Nooooo...
E: CONT'D
N: The boy laughs and grabs his father's hand, tugging.
C: ELISEO
D: Si Papa! Tenemos que ir!
N: The boy pulls with all his might. Silvio makes a show of resisting, then climbs out of bed. Eliseo keeps a tight hold of his hand, and walks him down a hall to a small kitchen with adobe walls and a dirt floor. An opening leads to a small patio that now serves mostly as a chicken coop. Two chickens are in the kitchen. A woman stands over a stove, cooking.
C: ELISEO
D: Papa necessita cafe y juevos! Tenemos priso mama!
E: CONT'D
N: She turns and smiles at her son, the bright star in her black life. Her eyes pass over Silvio. She stopped loving him years ago, but he adores their little boy... At least they have that. He sits down. She scoops eggs onto a plate with tortillas, drops it in front of him. Hands him a coffee. He sniffs it, hands it back. Without a word she pours in two fingers of tequila. The boy stares at his father with endless joy. No idea how unlucky he is. Silvio stares back, winks. The boy smiles.
S: EXT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- DAY.
N: Silvio and Eliseo exit the house. Silvio wears a State Police uniform, dressed to intimidate. The boy wears his uniform, dressed to play soccer. They walk past cinder-block houses, one after the other, cracked and faded from the sun. Tejano music, car horns, and distant yelling penetrate the morning. Two ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS drive past. Silvio and Eliseo wander away, Eliseo's tiny hand clinging to Silvio's police belt. Eliseo has his father for the whole day and he isn't letting go. They turn and disappear around the corner. Only thing on the street is a stray dog burying itself in an overturned trash can... The mascot of this dying city.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEACH -- SOUTH OF CARTAGENA -- DAY.
N: We are back with Alejandro, holding a man under water. Face to the sun, somehow able to focus fully on the task at hand while escaping to someplace else. He lets the man up. Coughing, heaving up salt water, and sobbing. He looks at Alejandro with the pleading eyes of a man whose will has been broken.
C: MAN
D: Colonel Guteman. Yes...
C: ALEJANDRO
D: And you too...
N: He nods.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Say it.
E: CONT'D
C: MAN
D: Of course me too! If the Americans would leave, you would see... no one is pure.
N: Alejandro lets the man up and pushes him toward the shore. We now see the man wears a MILITARY UNIFORM. He walks ahead of Alejandro, looking back. The man makes a half hearted attempt at attacking Alejandro, who pushes and spins him like a defiant child. They walk a few steps and the man tries it again. Alejandro's appears only half committed to the sloppy assault. Alejandro slaps the man across the face, then pushes him forward, slapping the back of his head as he does. They reach a stump where Alejandro's linen coat rests.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Sit down.
C: MAN
D: Why?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Can't walk back like this. We need to dry.
N: They sit back and bathe in the sun. The man is uncomfortable- kidnapper and captive, lounging on the shore. He considers running. Considers fighting him again, but settles on resting his tired back against the stump.
C: MAN
D: What will you do with me?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Nothing.
N: Beat.
C: MAN
D: Will I be arrested?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: No.
C: MAN
D: What will you do with the Colonel?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Nothing. I just wanted to know.
E: Alejandro turns his face to the sun
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. JUNGLE PATH -- COLOMBIA -- DAY.
N: Alejandro and the man walk along a two track road through a field of sugar cane.
C: MAN
D: If you tell. They will kill me... my family.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Don't give me a reason.
N: Beat.
C: MAN
D: How do I avoid that?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: By telling me the truth without having to drown you.
N: They come around a bend and we see: A COLOMBIAN MILITARY BASE. Structures built in simple but orderly rows. Humvees, one after the other, parked neatly in front. Soldiers move about. Colombia may be corrupt, but they are orderly about it. None of the filth and chaos of northern Mexico. They have been at it much longer, with battle lines very clearly drawn. The man turns to Alejandro.
C: MAN
D: So... that's it then?
N: Alejandro nods.
C: MAN
D: You act like the Narcos. You do things that I don't understand.
E: CONT'D
N: Alejandro offers him a polite smile.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: If you are very lucky you never will.
N: The man walks away, turning back occasionally to see if he is truly free. Alejandro turns in another direction, spots THREE US MARINE HUMVEES, EIGHT MARINES BESIDE THEM. Matt stands in front. They walk toward each other.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: It is the Colonel.
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: We'll get to that...
N: Alejandro looks over the Marines.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Why so many?
C: MATT
D: Don't want anything to happen to you on the way to the airport.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Where are we going?
C: MATT
D: To keep my promise.
N: Alejandro's kind, hollow eyes almost show emotion.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: What did they do?
C: MATT
D: Doesn't matter. It leads to Fausto. And I'm going to turn you loose.
N: Alejandro stands for a moment. The tiniest hint of a smile curls his lips.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Thank you.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- DAY.
N: Reggie drives, Macy riding shotgun. Through the windshield, we see the entrance to LUKE AIR FORCE BASE approaching.
C: REGGIE
D: You're back tonight?
C: MACY
D: Yeah. I'll call you, let you know what time.
C: REGGIE
D: I don't understand why they don't want me there...
N: She deflects.
C: MACY
D: It's El Paso... Don't think you're missing much.
C: REGGIE
D: Well... you keep your eye on that doughy prick in the golf shirt...
N: She smiles.
C: MACY
D: I'm supposed to worry about you.
C: REGGIE
D: This isn't what we do, Kate.
C: MACY
D: We do what we need to do.
S: EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX -- DAY.
N: Reggie pulls to the guard post, hands over their ID's. An AIR FORCE MP takes them, compares ID's to a list.
C: AIRPORT MP
D: You're not on here.
E: To Reggie
C: REGGIE
D: I know. What's she supposed to do?
C: AIRPORT MP
D: Walk.
N: Macy opens the door and steps out.
C: MACY
D: I'll call you when we're heading back.
N: She walks around the front of the Tahoe and disappears with the MP into the guard house.
S: EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX -- DAY.
N: Macy walks toward the runways, looking around, unsure where to go.
C: MATT
D: Kate.
E: O.S.
N: She turns, sees Matt.
C: MATT
D: This way.
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: Am I late?
C: MATT
D: No. We just landed.
N: She walks to him and they head off. Alejandro sits on a bench, patiently. They walk to him.
C: MATT
D: This is my bird dog, his name's Alejandro.
E: CONT'D
N: He stands.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Hello.
C: MACY
D: Kate Macy.
N: Alejandro studies her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Have you been to Juarez before?
C: MACY
D: No... Wait, we're going to El Paso, right?
C: MATT
D: Yeah, we'll talk about it on the plane.
N: He walks off, they follow. He leads them to a GULFSTREAM
C: MACY
D: We're taking this?
C: MATT
D: Yeah.
C: MACY
D: Really... Okay...
N: They climb in.
S: INT GULFSTREAM G650
N: They strap themselves in as the pilot speaks with the tower. Macy sits beside Alejandro. Studies him. He looks like a doctor or accountant, but there is an absent manner to his actions, as though nothing warrants his full attention but the weight of his thoughts. He catches her looking at him.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: What is your experience with operations like these?
C: MACY
D: None... What IS the operation?
N: He gives her a polite smile.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Sleep if you can. Juarez will demand all of your focus.
N: He lays his head back and closes his eyes. Macy looks at Matt.
C: MACY
D: Are we going into Juarez?
N: Shakes his head. Could be interpreted as a `no'.
C: MACY
D: DOD flies around in Gulfstreams now?
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: You guys don't have one?
N: She laughs.
C: MACY
D: Right... Food on this flight?
C: MATT
D: They got some bitchin peanuts in the back. Kind of a self-serve deal though.
N: He puts his head back, closes his eyes. She looks over at Alejandro who is already asleep. Macy's wired. No chance of sleep. Pulls a magazine from the seat back as the plane begins to taxi...
T: CUT TO:
N: -- FLASH BACK -- WE SEE: Alejandro's face in profile. Sunlight spilling over him through a small window. He looks different. Softer... Happy... DARK BROWN HAIR lowers into frame toward him. He pushes it back, revealing a young woman. She smiles and kisses him. He lets her hair fall as the kiss grows. Dark hair fills the frame... It gets very still. Darker now. Sunlight is gone. We PULL BACK. Farther. Farther still. See the woman's body. She lays face down in a hallway, naked. Blood pooled beneath her. We hear a HEART BEAT. We move down a hall. Heart beating FASTER. Past a MEXICAN POLICE OFFICER, who somberly watches us... At the end of the hall we hear something rubbing, swaying. We move faster. Heart beats faster. Racing now. Come to the end of the hall, the SWAYING IS LOUDER. We turn left, push open a door. Look up -- The swaying sound is a ROPE. It swings in and out of frame. We follow it down -- the LIFELESS BODY OF A YOUNG GIRL at the end of it. BACK TO PRESENT-- Alejandro jolts awake, slamming his hands into the seat in front of him -- scaring the living shit out of Macy.
C: MACY
D: JESUS!!
N: Alejandro looks straight ahead.
C: MACY
D: You okay?
E: CONT'D
N: Doesn't look at her. Sweat rolls down his face.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Yes.
N: She keeps looking at him. He turns to her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I'm fine.
E: CONT'D
N: We hear the pilot announce their initial descent into El Paso's FORT BLISS. Alejandro leans back in his seat.
C: MACY
D: So... This is your specialty.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Hmm?
C: MACY
D: He said the cartels in Mexico are your specialty.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Yes.
C: MACY
D: Anything I should know?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You are asking how a watch works. For now, only focus on knowing the time.
N: Alejandro lays his head back. Closes his eyes. Macy mumbles to herself.
C: MACY
D: Okay... Yoda.
S: EXT. FORT BLISS AIR STRIP -- EL PASO -- DAY.
N: Alejandro, Macy, and Matt walk off the plane, blinded by the desert sun. A man in his late 30's, mustache, DEA AGENT STEVE FERSING, waves from inside a BLACK CHEVY TAHOE. They walk over and climb in.
S: INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONTINUOUS.
C: STEVE
D: How you been?
C: MATT
D: Good. Trying to get DOD to let me look into this conspiracy to sink Figi.
N: Steve chuckles.
C: STEVE
D: It's the damn terrorists. They're sinking all the tropical islands.
C: MATT
D: I figure a month or two there, I could get it worked out.
C: STEVE
D: Hear there's a real drug problem at the Four Seasons there. You need any help looking into it...
C: MATT
D: Yeah, I'll keep you posted... who's going over today?
C: STEVE
D: Marshals, DEA. Pulled a team for you.
C: MATT
D: I get all warm and fuzzy when you say `team'.
C: STEVE
D: It's a crack bunch too. Just rotated back from Afghanistan.
C: MATT
D: Where's everybody linking up?
C: STEVE
D: Army Intelligence Center.
N: Macy listens intently, trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about. Alejandro looks out across the border. Alejandro seems different. He is somewhere else. Somewhere bad.
S: EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- EL PASO -- DAY.
N: TWENTY FOOT WALLS surround the center. A GUARD POST in front of an enormous closed gate. The Tahoe pulls up... A guard, dressed like he is on mission in Afghanistan, steps forward.
C: GUARD
D: ID's all around. Hey Steve.
N: Even Steve hands his ID. The guard returns to the guard house with the IDs. Matt turns around and faces Macy.
C: MATT
D: Thought you were in the big time in Phoenix... welcome to Baghdad.
N: The guard returns with their IDs.
C: GUARD
D: Be safe.
N: The gate opens and they pull in. There must be fifty vehicles, most are unmarked SUVs, but a dozen Humvees and six ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, complete with 20mm cannons. The area is alive with activity. Agents, deputies, and special forces operators are moving about. The Tahoe parks and our team gets out. They follow Steve toward the entrance to:
S: INT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING ROOM -- CONT.
N: A US MARSHAL stands in front of a video screen showing the route into and out of Juarez. Twenty men seated in chairs. None wear uniforms, but all wear tactical vests, drop-leg holsters, assault rifles by there side. It sounds and looks like a military operation. They take a seat in the back. Macy the men seated around her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Pay attention.
N: She is surprised by the directive, turns her focus to the speaker.
C: MARSHAL
D: Mexican Federal Police will meet you at the border and proceed with you to the courthouse located here. This is a high level target. The most likely spot for an attempt will be at the exchange and the border. The Marshals will enter -- Kevin, Keith, wanna stand up?
E: Pointing on map
N: Two men in their 50's stand up. They look like they were teleported from another time -- starched white shirts under bullet proof vests, starched Wranglers, bone colored cowboy hats, and faces tough as boot leather. They turn to the room without smiling.
C: MATT
D: Man, I love Texans.
E: Smiling
N: Alejandro whispers to her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Memorize the faces of everyone here. Know who is with you.
C: MARSHAL
D: Marshals' response team is in Laredo so, our friends from Delta have volunteered to come along and will escort the Marshals at the exchange.
N: The Marshal speaking notices Matt in the back.
C: MARSHAL
D: Here's the man of the hour. You coming or waiting here?
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: Sure, we'll take the tour. Loan me a couple of pop guns?
C: MARSHAL
D: This is turning into an All-Star affair. Wanna another hand at the exchange, Keith?
C: KEITH
D: You sober?
E: To Matt
N: Matt laughs.
C: MATT
D: I will be by the time we get there.
C: KEITH
D: I got a bottle in the truck in case yer hands git to shakin.
C: MATT
D: I miss your hospitality, Keith.
N: Turns to Macy.
C: MATT
D: Guess we're going sightseeing.
E: CONT'D
N: Macy looks very uncomfortable.
C: MARSHAL
D: Alright. So, and we'll gear you up when we're done, Matt -- you can be the tip of the spear and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta... Be careful on the turn-around -- if a Federale is a shooter it will be on the turn around. Ray, your Team 1 is lead vehicle and we can divide team 2 into the carry car and the trail vehicles, that okay?
N: A man with a short beard and very broad shoulders nods.
C: MARSHAL
D: Ray, If Delta could stand up so everyone can see who to stand behind if the shit hits the fan...
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone laughs. The Delta operators rise. Though this is a room of professionals, these men truly look like the ones you want to stand behind.
C: MARSHAL
D: Most likely spot for a hit is at the border crossing on the return. State Police has agree to hold a lane for you. Heads up if they don't... Anywhere along the way, anyone not in this room is a potential shooter. This op isn't over until we are back here, okay? Be aware, be vigilant, and stay alert. Let's go.
E: CONT'D
N: Men begin rising and readying their gear. The mood is relaxed. Matt walks to the Marshal -- they shake hands and disappear in the back.
C: MACY
D: Ever been over there?
N: He looks at her and offers a smile.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I worked in Juarez.
C: MACY
D: For the DEA?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: No.
N: He offers nothing further.
C: MACY
D: For who?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Mexico. As a federal prosecutor.
C: MACY
D: You're not American?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: No.
N: She tries to make sense of that.
C: MACY
D: Who do you work for now?
N: Alejandro smiles.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I go where I'm sent.
C: MACY
D: Where were you sent FROM?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Cartagena.
C: MACY
D: ... Colombia?
N: Alejandro nods. Matt emerges from the other room carrying two M4 carbines and a Kevlar vest. Macy sees him and marches to him.
C: MATT
D: See if this fits.
E: Handing her the vest
C: MACY
D: Is he CIA? Are you?
E: Pointing toward Alejandro
C: MATT
D: Try it on.
C: MACY
D: Well?
C: MATT
D: He's a DOD advisor, just like me.
N: She doesn't budge, holds his gaze.
C: MATT
D: Pay attention to Alejandro -- he says do something, do it.
E: CONT'D
N: She takes that as a `yes'.
C: MACY
D: I'm not authorized to --
C: MATT
D: Fine. Stay here.
N: She shifts her weight. Hesitates...
C: MATT
D: But you don't want to, do you?
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: I just wanna know what I'm getting INTO --
C: MATT
D: You asked to get on this train. Because you KNOW you're not stopping anything in Phoenix. You're just sweeping up the mess. In six months, every house you raid will be rigged with explosives... You want to find the men responsible? This is where we start.
N: He walks off. After a moment, she follows.
S: EXT. CESAR CHAVEZ BORDER HIGHWAY -- EL PASO -- DAY.
N: FIVE CHEVY TAHOES, sirens on the dashboard move through El Paso. We watch from above as they cut their way through traffic...
S: INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONT.
N: Macy sits in the back beside Alejandro. He holds a rifle between his legs, barrel pointed down. Macy notices his right hand -- his finger rests on the button that rolls down the window.
C: MACY
D: So how nervous should I be?
N: The DEA Agent riding shotgun turns back to her.
C: AGENT
D: Are you kidding?
N: He points out the window.
C: AGENT
D: Over there? That's the beast.
E: CONT'D
N: He turns back, facing front. She looks out the window to Juarez. It is so close, you could throw a frisbee into it.
S: EXT. BORDER HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS.
N: THE CONVOY turns onto the BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS. Border Agents have closed the left lane to traffic, in preparation for the convoy's arrival. From above, we see MEXICO. Some THIRTY FEDERAL POLICE TRUCKS, SOLDIERS FILLING THE BEDS are waiting for them. The convoy drives straight through -- the Mexican Police trucks roll forward as our convoy catches up to them. THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF SCENE, WE WILL INTERCUT IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLES The city of Juarez is itself a crime. Filthy and crumbling, hookers and criminals fill every possible space of sidewalk. They are as plentiful as the unfortunate masses that are condemned to live and work here. SIRENS BLARE. POLICE YELL OVER LOUD SPEAKERS AND THROUGH MEGAPHONES FOR VEHICLES TO PULL OVER AND LET THE CONVOY PASS. SWEAT rolls down Macy's face. She can feel her heart beating... Loud enough she actually wonders if others hear it too. At every turn, it seems there are soldiers and police. A large group of police can be seen on a side-street, standing around a car -- a DEAD BODY on the street beside it. Macy sees a woman in her 20's SPRINTING down the street, SCREAMING, though there is no one chasing her. Alejandro taps her on the shoulder, motions her to scoot toward him.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Want to see Juarez?
N: He points to A BRIDGE WHERE THE BODY OF A MAN HANGS, a dozen soldiers looking down at it. As we look closer, we see he has been decapitated -- his head replaced with that of a pig, crudely sewn to his body with fishing line. The body is naked from the waist down -- a state police shirt on his torso. As the convoy races up the street, the bridge and it's swinging corpse come closer.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Hard to believe, yes?
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: Yes.
E: Breathless
C: ALEJANDRO
D: He wears the state police shirt. The pig -- Not what you think it means. All state police work for the cartels. ALL of them. That man... He tried to work for two... he got greedy.
N: They continue past. Into an even worse part of Juarez, if that's possible. The vehicles come to a stop. POPPING SOUNDS can be heard. Like fireworks.
C: AGENT
D: Hear that?
N: He cracks his window. The sound floods in. GUNFIRE. Not ten shots, not fifty. Hundreds. It is a battle. Over the radio we HEAR:
C: VOICE
D: Everybody hold on. Mexicans are adjusting our route. There's activity ahead we need to go around.
N: We sit here, listening to the gunfight as it builds in intensity. We hear a series of explosions. Both agents in the front seats reposition their rifles. Ready. The convoy rolls again. Makes a left, drives away from the battle as though they were avoiding road construction. A few blocks and they all snake right. Macy is trying hard not to be terrified. Suddenly, the convoy picks up speed. Moving 70mph over a road that barely qualifies as two lanes. They race past a park. A large building can be seen on the right. The Mexican flag flies in front. Numerous Federal Police vehicles in front. The convoy stops in front and the Delta operators are out of their vehicles, setting a perimeter. The Marshals and Matt emerge and move straight to the building, two Deltas follow. Macy stays glued to the front door of the building. Waiting. Alejandro shifts in his seat toward Macy.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Nothing will happen here. If they try anything, it will be at the border. If no lane is cleared for us when we return... Be ready. Watch the cars. Look for old cars. Throw aways. Not gangster cars... Those are for the whores on Saturday night. Did you watch the cars we passed driving in?
N: She shakes her head `no'
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Watch for state police. They are all bad. We will lose the escort at the loop. You will see. That is when you worry.
E: CONT'D
N: Matt and the Marshals come out with a man covered in a blanket. He is placed in the backseat. The federal Police begin turning their vehicles.
C: AGENT
D: NOW.
N: Suddenly, the Tahoe lurches forward -- moving between the vehicle with Matt and the Marshals -- acting as a shield. Macy looks out the window at the Federal Police trucks. She notices the agent riding shotgun has his rifle at the ready in the direction of the Federal Police.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Lean back, Kate.
E: O.S.
N: She turns to find him pointing his rifle almost at her head. She leans back, and moves her hands toward her ears, ready to cover them.
C: MACY
D: Jesus.
C: AGENT
D: Okay. Go.
N: The Tahoe begins moving and performs a lighting fast three point turn, and just like that we are headed north. Macy lets out an endless sigh of relief. We are driving very fast now. Macy looks out the windshield, the hills of El Paso loom in the distance.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: On the left.
N: Two streets over, as buildings whip by, we see a STATE POLICE VEHICLE even with us. It disappears as buildings fill our view, then at the next block we see it again. We hear over the radio --
C: VOICE
D: We have a spotter on the left everyone. Keep your eyes out for a strike vehicle.
N: The driver speaks into his radio.
C: DRIVER
D: Mexico holding a lane for us at the border?
C: VOICE
D: That's my understanding. We're trying to confirm...
N: As we race to the border, the state police vehicle has DISAPPEARED. We come to the loop, the last exit before being fed into the twelve lanes leading only to the border crossing... WITH NO WAY OUT. At the loop, the Mexican Federal Police vehicles peel off, leaving the convoy alone. At the border, US HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICERS can be seen standing with rifles, making a very public show of force. There is no lane cleared for them, and just like that -- they are trapped in traffic.
C: VOICE
D: Everyone stay in this lane. Our agents at the border are going to wave everyone through and get us over as quick as they can.
E: CONT'D
N: The agents at the border aren't even checking passports, just moving cars through in the lane where the convoy is trapped, but there are fifty cars ahead of them... Alejandro looks out his window and sees, two lanes over: FOUR MEN in an old Buick LeSabre. They are staring straight ahead. All drenched in sweat. Alejandro taps Macy, she scoots closer.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You have a service weapon?
C: MACY
D: Yes.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Get it out.
N: She unholsters her pistol.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Silver LeSabre. Two lanes over my
E: CONT'D
C: AGENT
D: Yep.
N: He takes the radio.
C: AGENT
D: Silver LeSabre, two lanes right, 3 o'clock.
E: CONT'D
C: VOICE
D: One lane over right, 5 o'clock. Burgundy Expedition.
C: VOICE2
D: Three lanes over right, 1 o'clock, green honda civic.
N: Macy grips her pistol.
C: MACY
D: Okay... okay...
N: Then Alejandro spots it.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Gun. Buick LeSabre, 3 o'clock, gun.
N: The flash suppressor of an AK 47 is peeking out in the back seat. A sweaty, young gunman holds the rifle between his legs.
C: VOICE2
D: What are the rules here?
C: VOICE
D: We must be engaged to engage.
C: VOICE2
D: Can we get out of this vehicle and set a perimeter?
C: VOICE
D: Stay in your vehicle. You can do what they do. If they get out you can get out.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: watch the door handles.
E: To Macy
N: The cars are beginning to move in the convoy's lane. Another fifteen seconds and they can leave this hell behind.
C: VOICE
D: Get ready. They can see our lane clearing. If it's coming, it's coming now.
N: Only a few more cars and the convoy is clear. But that would mean luck is on their side and luck doesn't live on this side of the border. The doors to the Expedition swing open. By the time the assassins put a foot to the ground, the Delta operators are out of their cars and halfway to them, rifles raised. Before Macy can react, she is ALONE in the Tahoe. Even the driver has exited... she is starting to panic.
C: MACY
D: Think... think...
N: She looks at her pistol, grips it tight. And goes nowhere.
C: MACY
D: Okay...
E: CONT'D
N: The assassins are frozen, guns by their sides. A dozen Americans have weapons trained on them. The Agent riding shotgun stands in front of the Buick, rifle pointed at the windshield. Other operators are at the flank of the Civic before their doors are even open. But at the Expedition, men are already out, weapons in their hands. The delta operators and Alejandro are yelling at the men in Spanish. One retreats to the safety of the back seat, but the others know the consequences of a failed hit and they aren't in checkmate like those in the other cars... The assassins, none over twenty years old, yell and cuss and threaten as the operators surround them in a semicircle. The assassin that exited the drivers seat -- 2 carat diamond earrings and no shirt on his skinny chest -- screams in hateful defiance at the operators surrounding him. He raises his weapon and ALEJANDRO AND THE OPERATORS FIRE -- He is obliterated -- They continue firing, surgically killing all the Expedition's crew. Bullets ping through the windshield. Bullets tear the Expedition to shreds. The assassins never fire a shot. The innocent masses stuck in the crossfire duck out of view in their vehicles. The streets are instantly empty. The noise of the shooting echoes off the asphalt with the force of thunder. Macy watches through the back window.
C: MACY
D: WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING??!!
E: CONT'D
N: The men watching the other vehicles hold targets in their sights. The rest will take their chances with the boss. Don't even look in the direction of the Americans -- just stare straight ahead, sweating... The operators and Alejandro work their way back to the vehicle. Everyone retreats to their cars. The kid with the AK 47 in the back of the Buick makes a move for his door handle. Alejandro clocks it, puts 10 rounds through the window, killing him and the man beside him before the door is opened. Macy turns away in shock to find: A MEXICAN STATE POLICE OFFICER 5 FEET FROM HER WINDOW!!! He raises an AK 47 to his shoulder -- pointed right at her. Before she can think, her gun is raised and firing through the tinted window. The sound is deafening. As the man falls out of view, all we can hear is the RINGING IN HER EARS. Alejandro and the agent riding shotgun jump in and roll their windows down and sit out of them like turrets as the vehicles start up and race to the border. They pass the guard house without stopping, Border Agents waving them onward through the finish line. More agents point weapons and scream at the Mexican State police officers who have emerged from their offices. It is absolute madness... Alejandro and the agent sit back in the vehicles and roll up the windows... They are back in America. Macy struggles to get her breath. No one speaks. After a long beat...
C: MACY
D: This is going to be on the front page of every newspaper in America.
E: CONT'D
C: AGENT
D: No it won't. It won't even make the paper in El Paso...
N: The convoy is safe. It races past traffic, red sirens lighting the dashboards...
S: EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DAY.
N: The vehicles pull in and park. Agents and operators exit the vehicles and amble toward the entrance. Macy gets out, her head spinning. Matt walks up to her. She holds out a hand, begging him away.
C: MACY
D: JUST... Give me a minute.
C: MATT
D: Yeah. That got a little nutty, huh?
C: MACY
D: No. No. Don't... NO. This isn't ... This was a SPECIAL OP. You're a fucking spook. And HIM!! Who the fuck is that??
N: She points at Alejandro. He lets her vent. Burning the unused adrenaline.
C: MATT
D: Hey. I told you to stay here...
C: MACY
D: I'm not qualified for this. I'm good at what I do, but I'm not a soldier.
C: MATT
D: Don't sell yourself short. Reason Reggie's home is I know he's not ready for this, but he's gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in...
C: MACY
D: Don't put me in a situation where I have to break the law to stay alive. Don't do that to me.
N: Steve walks up to Matt.
C: STEVE
D: You wanna get cracking?
C: MATT
D: On that note, I think you better stay out here.
N: Matt winks and walks in the building, leaving Macy alone in the motor pool.
S: INT INTERROGATION ROOM DAY
N: A door opens and we find GUILLERMO, 45, fat, three day stubble, and very unhappy to be here. His hands are cuffed behind his back. A DEA AGENT holds a bottle of water that Guillermo sucks like an infant. Matt walks in.
C: MATT
D: Giving him a belly full of water... you devil.
E: CONT'D
N: Matt smiles, the agent smiles back. Matt sits in the only other chair in the room.
C: MATT
D: Didn't think we'd get you here, did you?
E: CONT'D
C: GUILLERMO
D: NO HABLO-
C: MATT
D: I love it when they don't hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you `hablo' to him.
N: The door opens and Alejandro walks in, carrying two five gallon jugs of water. It takes Guillermo a minute, then horror washes over his face.
C: GUILLERMO
D: El Medellin.
C: MATT
D: Alejandro, he remembers you.
N: No expression on Alejandro's face. The DEA Agent moves to the door.
C: DEA AGENT
D: I'm gonna step out.
N: He closes the door behind him. The red `record' button on the camera mounted in the corner goes out. We notice a DRAIN IN THE FLOOR. Alejandro walks toward Guillermo, stands across from him. Places a foot on his chest. Pushes... Hard... Guillermo sways back, like a chopped tree. He moves through frame in slow motion, falling out of frame.
S: EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DUSK.
N: Macy leans against a car. Spots a guy with a cigarette.
C: MACY
D: Hey. Got another one of those?
N: He gives her one. Lights it. She draws in, coughs.
C: MACY
D: Been a while. Thanks.
E: CONT'D
C: DELTA
D: Like fireworks?
E: O.S.
N: She turns and sees a Delta operator. Holding a pair of BINOLULARS.
C: DELTA
D: Come here.
E: CONT'D
N: She follows him. They walk to the back of the motor pool to a stairway that leads to the roof of the building. He goes up. She hesitates.
C: DELTA
D: Up to you.
E: CONT'D
N: She takes the bait. Climbs up. They sit on the edge of the roof, facing Juarez. He begins glassing the area.
C: MACY
D: Fireworks is code for something, I assume.
C: DELTA
D: Sort of.
N: He glasses. She smokes, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
C: DELTA
D: Here we go.
E: CONT'D
N: He hands her the binoculars.
C: DELTA
D: Look right there.
E: CONT'D
N: --THROUGH THE BINOCULARS WE LOOK OVER JUAREZ-- She sees it. Muzzle flashes. Right on the street. Rifle fire glowing white against the muddy gray of Juarez at dusk. Gone as fast as it came. She looks at Delta.
C: DELTA
D: Keep looking.
E: CONT'D
N: She begins scanning the city. Sirens. Everywhere. She sees another muzzle flash. She looks up.
C: MACY
D: I don't hear anything.
C: DELTA
D: Can't. Too far away. Keep looking. They're everywhere.
N: She scans the city slowly. Sirens. More sirens. The city is lit in a throbbing red and blue.
C: MACY
D: Unbelievable.
C: DELTA
D: Madness, huh.
N: He bums a drag from her cigarette. They sit in silence and watch the city go to war.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- NIGHT.
N: Macy, Matt, and Alejandro walk through the parking lot. Macy is exhausted. Matt's on his cell phone.
C: MATT
D: Can they get them all in one place? No... I'm on a clock now, I can't wait... No, contact Bob Fiske. Have him hold all of them at the staging center. How far is Tuscon?
E: Turns to Macy
C: MACY
D: From here? Little over two hours.
C: MATT
D: We'll be there a little after 2.
N: Not what Macy wanted to hear.
C: MACY
D: We're going to Tucson?
C: MATT
D: You gotta learn how to sleep on a plane.
N: Reggie leans against the Tahoe. Not very happy.
C: REGGIE
D: They let me on the base when this peckerwood needs a ride, don't they?
C: MACY
D: REGGIE-
C: MATT
D: Has nothing to do with your race. I just don't believe you're good enough at your job yet to be of any use. Kate's sure fond of you, though.
E: Pleasant as can be
C: REGGIE
D: Thanks, man. I feel much better now.
N: Reggie spots Alejandro.
C: REGGIE
D: Who's that.
E: CONT'D
N: Macy shakes her head, doesn't have the strength to go into it.
C: MACY
D: We're going to Tucson.
N: Matt and Alejandro get in the back seat of the Tahoe. We push in on Alejandro's emotionless face.
C: REGGIE
D: Now?
E: O.S.
N: She nods and yawns at the same time. Reggie takes her in.
C: REGGIE
D: Hey... How was it?
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: Bad.
C: REGGIE
D: What happened?
N: She moves toward the front of the car.
C: MACY
D: Now's not the time.
N: They climb in. Reggie looks over at Macy staring out the window, resting her heavy head on her fist. He looks back at Matt and Alejandro, both already asleep.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PROCESSING CENTER -- TUSCON -- NIGHT.
N: The team walks from their parked car toward an irate BOB FISKE, 40'S, walking toward them.
C: BOB
D: What's the deal, Matt? Why you holding up my transports?
C: MATT
D: We'll be quick.
C: BOB
D: I have to feed these bastards when we hold em. Know how an internal auditor responds to an eight thousand dollar check to fucking Domino's Pizza?
C: MATT
D: You're so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner `what's his name'... It was her call.
N: Doesn't introduce Alejandro and Bob doesn't ask- Kate notices.
C: MACY
D: I don't even know what we're doing here. Got another one of those?
E: Pointing to his cigarette
C: BOB
D: Finish it before we get inside.
N: He gives her one, lights her as they walk. The giant, domed warehouse growing closer. The dull murmur of four hundred people talking and sitting and moving and complaining is wafting out like an odor. Macy tries to suck the entire cigarette in one drag. Reggie leans into her.
C: REGGIE
D: What happened in El Paso? Talk to me.
C: MACY
D: We weren't in El Paso.
C: REGGIE
D: ... Where were you?
C: MACY
D: We were in Mexico.
N: Reggie stops. Macy doesn't. She reaches the door and flicks the smoke on the ground.
S: INT. IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS.
N: The illegals have been separated by sex and criminal record. Women on the left... The worker bees -- the busboys and landscapers and construction workers -- are in the center, and in the back, lined up against the wall, the felons... Three dozen HOMELAND SECURITY AGENTS stand over them with M4s.
C: BOB
D: There you go. I'm starting the buses. When you're done with em, send em out.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: All the women can go.
C: BOB
D: Coulda told me that on the phone, Matt.
C: MATT
D: First I've heard it.
N: They head toward the group of felons and the like as the women are moved out to the buses.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Watch these men close. Look for the ones like the men you saw in Juarez.
N: Macy looks at him. His kind, sad demeanor seems to settle her. She knows he is offering her something, just doesn't know why. She turns to the men against the wall. They have their hands behind their backs, zip tied.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Do you see?
E: CONT'D
N: She scans their faces. Many have tattoos, shaved heads. A boy, maybe 18, haircut like a pop star from the 90's. Diamond earrings, stares hard at her.
C: MACY
D: Him.
N: Alejandro nods.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Yes. Keep looking.
N: She studies more faces. The ones that look like American gangsters- they look down, away, no eye contact. But the ones with mustaches no longer in style, hair parted down the middle, the lanky teens with Polo shirts, they stare defiantly. No fear of consequence from American officers. As subtle as the differences are- how they wear their pants, how they lean against the wall... she understands now.
C: MACY
D: Yeah. I see it.
N: She turns to Alejandro, but he is gone. She turns around and he stands thirty feet back beside Matt, looking over the migrants. Macy walks back to them.
C: MACY
D: What are we looking for?
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: Two ways to find drug routes. You can play cat and mouse with those clowns, or ask these guys what trails they avoid.
N: They walk toward the largest group, the simple migrants. The ones that are filthy, tired. Eager to either be sent back to Mexico or go to work.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: They see it all, and must avoid the traps set everywhere for them. We look for one who is older... one who has had enough.
N: Bob walks up.
C: BOB
D: You done with these behind you?
C: MATT
D: All yours.
N: The Agents begin yelling and marching the smuggler group out. Alejandro turns to Bob.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Break them into groups of four, Let them spread out, each group as far from the other as possible.
N: Bob huddles his agents and begins explaining as Matt and Alejandro walk off. We see Reggie, observing from the entrance. He's had enough `not knowing', walks to Macy.
C: REGGIE
D: What are we doing here? What were you doing in Mexico??
E: Looks her over
C: MACY
D: I'm with you, alright. I don't have answers.
C: REGGIE
D: Well, let's get some then.
N: She looks at him.
C: MACY
D: You think I haven't asked these questions. Think you can do better? MATT. Can we talk to you for a minute?
N: He starts walking toward them. They head for the open warehouse door.
S: EXT IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE CONT.
N: Macy and Reggie stop in the center of the parking lot. Matt catches up to them.
C: MATT
D: This feels very serious.
C: REGGIE
D: What are we looking for? There's in the dark and then there's the way you're treating us. I want to know the objective, or I walk. Period.
C: MATT
D: Then go. I didn't ask you to be a part of this. She did.
C: MACY
D: I walk too.
N: Reggie stares at Matt, who casually smiles, pacifying the children.
C: MATT
D: What would you like to know?
C: REGGIE
D: Everything.
C: MATT
D: Guillermo told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So now, we're trying to find what areas near there migrants avoid. Because that's where the tunnel will be. Better?
C: REGGIE
D: Guillermo is...?
N: Matt laughs.
C: MATT
D: I'm going back in.
N: He turns.
C: MACY
D: He TOLD you where a drug tunnel is... Just... Told you.
C: MATT
D: Guillermo didn't have any other options. We send him back across the border and he's a dead man. Had to give us something.
N: He just smiles...
C: MACY
D: Bullshit.
C: REGGIE
D: Look man, we have a boss, and you ain't him. Be straight. What are you doing?
C: MATT
D: We're going to make enough noise that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see HIS boss.
C: REGGIE
D: And then?
C: MATT
D: And then we know where his boss is.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Fausto Alarcon, Manuel's cousin... Manuel's boss... He is an executioner...
E: O.S.
N: Alejandro stands beside them, but looks out over the black desert.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: When people die in my country, it is with his hand or his blessing. To find him would be like... discovering a vaccine. Manuel will lead us to him.
E: CONT'D
N: His kind, hollow eyes meet Reggie's. Alejandro manufactures a smile.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Certainly, you understand the value of that.
E: CONT'D
C: REGGIE
D: Alright... We're good. Just don't keep us in the dark.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: There is only dark, my friend.
N: Reggie studies this strange, sad man. Looks at him with something between fear and mistrust. Macy just looks tired and mad. Matt takes them both in.
C: MACY
D: What happens when you find him?
N: But Alejandro is already walking back to the warehouse.
C: MATT
D: It's been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest. We'll find a ride. See you tomorrow.
N: Matt turns and walks back.
C: REGGIE
D: I just drove a hundred fucking miles...
C: MACY
D: This is a blessing, trust me. I want to stop and get some cigarettes.
C: REGGIE
D: Got you smoking again... it was that bad?
N: She moves to the car.
C: MACY
D: Worse.
N: Reggie watches Matt walk back in the warehouse, trying desperately to play catch up. Wondering why no one, his partner included, will tell him anything...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- NIGHT.
N: Reggie drives down an empty interstate 19. Up ahead, he spots a TRUCK STOP.
C: REGGIE
D: Not that I think you should, but if you want cigarettes --
N: He looks over -- she is sound asleep. He drives past the truck stop, tail lights fading into the desert...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- DAY.
N: Macy lays in bed watching the blades of her ceiling fan in their endless revolution. She rises -- dressed in pajamas at last -- and heads to the kitchen. She pours a cup of coffee, heads to her computer. Pulls up the CNN website, scrolls the news, nothing about a shoot-out on the border. Goes to the El Paso newspaper website. Nothing there either. She googles SHOOT OUT, JUAREZ... is bombarded with images. Her screen is flooded with photos: women naked, tortured, beaten. Breasts cut off, pinkish flesh exposed. Bodies of men in ditches, dead in chairs, dead in cars... dead everywhere. But nothing of yesterday. The images invade her. Can't look anymore... She digs up a cigarette, goes to her screen door, opens it and steps out, lights her smoke. She sees Reggie pull up and park. She yells down to him.
C: MACY
D: What's up?
C: REGGIE
D: You're phone's off.
C: MACY
D: Yep.
C: REGGIE
D: We gotta go. Those spooks been calling me all morning.
C: MACY
D: Want some coffee?
C: REGGIE
D: We gotta go.
C: MACY
D: I have to get dressed. Come up.
S: INT MACY'S APARTMENT DAY
N: Reggie leans against the dining room table, cup of coffee in hand. Macy moves from her bathroom, slacks on and only an old, off white bra. He notices. Doesn't hide it.
C: REGGIE
D: Gotta get you a new bra, woman.
C: MACY
D: List of things I need is almost infinite.
C: REGGIE
D: Just saying. You gotta... some nice lacy something.
N: She walks in the room, buttoning the last of her shirt.
C: MACY
D: Been so long since anyone's seen me in a bra, except you... don't look at me like that. No pity, thank you.
C: REGGIE
D: How was seeing Evan the other day?
C: MACY
D: ...I don't know.
C: REGGIE
D: Miss him?
C: MACY
D: Guy works eighty hours a week and thinks I'm too focused on my job.
C: REGGIE
D: Mmhmm. And what does that tell you?
N: Beat.
C: MACY
D: Ask me something else.
N: Beat.
C: REGGIE
D: What was it like? On the border.
N: She turns to him. How do you describe it...
C: MACY
D: It's broken ... The whole place. Just ... Lost.
N: He absorbs that.
C: REGGIE
D: Wish you hadn't volunteered for this.
C: MACY
D: Me too. But... I have to know.
C: REGGIE
D: Know what?
C: MACY
D: Could it get that bad here?
C: REGGIE
D: Well, you sure picked the mother fuckers to show us.
C: MACY
D: Yeah...
S: EXT SCOTTDALE BEST WESTERN DAY
N: Reggie and Macy knock on the door. It opens. Matt, dressed for golf, stands there with a slurpee.
C: MATT
D: Come on in.
N: They walk into the `suite', the best a motel room can be. The walls are covered with TOPO MAPS of Arizona, ROAD MAPS, and GEOLOGICAL MAPS... Alejandro sits at a table with FOUR MIGRANTS from the warehouse. Worker bees. Alejandro points to a spot on the map with a chopstick from their take out. MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) You can't cross there. Points somewhere else. MIGRANT 1 (CONT'D) There is okay. MIGRANT 2 (SUBTITLE) But the coyotes there are crooked. No women can cross there... Alejandro looks at Matt.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: We should watch here.
N: Alejandro points to another spot, just across the border from Sasabe, Mexico. All the migrants say `No!' In unison, even laughing at the notion. MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) That is drug land. The only people that cross there are forced to. To keep the Border patrol busy. MIGRANT 2 (SUBTITLE) You try to cross there, they will kill you. And for a woman... a rape tree for her. MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) That is for their tunnels. Never cross where there is tunnels.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You know this land? A tunnel where cars can pass?
E: SUBTITLE
N: MIGRANT 1 Oh yeah. For years, the best place to cross... right here. He points to a depression on the TOPO MAP. MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D) This arroyo? You can walk it all the way to highway 86. There is shade and a spring -- here. But a tunnel is there now. Don't go there... Reggie's jaw is on the floor.
C: MACY
D: Are you getting this?
C: REGGIE
D: Yeah. I don't believe it, but I understand what they're saying.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Can you mark the tunnel on here?
E: SUBTITLE
N: Hands him a pen. MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) Sure. It's been a while. Three years. They made me dig for a month to cross. I snuck out one night and ran... They hide the entrance behind an old car.
C: MATT
D: Guillermo was telling the truth.
N: Alejandro looks at Matt.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: This is our way across. Right here. Where do you live?
E: Back to the migrants
N: MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) East of the airport. Matt spoons the last of his slurpee. Turns to Macy.
C: MATT
D: How good is your Spanish?
C: MACY
D: Not great.
C: REGGIE
D: Mine is. How did you get all this?
N: Matt smiles, spooning himself slurpee.
C: MATT
D: Power of persuasion.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Know a Wells Fargo on Baseline?
E: SUBTITLE
N: MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) No cabron. We drive to Cave Creek for the bank. There is a Wells Fargo on Baseline, but it is a narco bank. The narcos hit you as you walk to it... Only the Salvadorans use it, cuz they don't know... the soldiers deposit narco money there. They will rob you cabron, to make up for what they skimmed. No, you have to bank up by the white cowboys, that is safest.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Guillermo told the truth about everything.
E: Looks at Matt
C: MATT
D: We're gonna have a good day. Let's send these guys home.
E: Points to the migrants
C: MACY
D: Border patrol's not down there.
C: MATT
D: Think they'd tell us all this and then go back to Mexico? You get one night's sleep and forget everything?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Thank you ... don't cross again. Not for a long time.
E: SUBTITLE
N: The migrant looks down at a small card in his hand. The others have them as well. MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) These green cards are good?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Better than good, my friend.
E: SUBTITLE
N: The men get up casually and walk out, sipping their soft drinks. Matt looks at Macy.
C: MATT
D: Have friends at Phoenix SWAT?
C: MACY
D: Yeah, we use them for breeches when HRT is busy.
C: MATT
D: They any good?
C: MACY
D: Yeah... they get a lot of practice.
N: He nods.
C: MATT
D: Got a new frame of reference for practice now, don't you. Let's give Phoenix SWAT a call, shall we?
C: MACY
D: What did you find out?
E: To Alejandro
N: He lays a hand on her shoulder. The intimacy of the gesture surprises her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: We are close.
T: CUT TO:
N: WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH A TELEPHOTO LENS. We watch a MAN, 20'S, BAGGY JEANS, WHITE T-SHIRT, sitting on the curb, fiddling with an IPhone.
C: VOICE
D: We taking him when he makes the grab?
C: MATT
D: When he comes out of the bank. We need the deposit receipt to seize the account. Let him do the assault... we hit him when he comes out.
E: O.S.
N: Through the lens we see A WOMAN, 50's, waddling up. The young man approaches her. He's talking to her. She shakes her head. He discreetly punches her in the kidney. She reacts, then reaches into her purse. She hands him cash, then kneels down and begins writing something on a piece a paper.
C: MACY
D: What is she doing?
E: O.S.
C: MATT
D: Endorsing over her paycheck.
E: O.S.
N: She stands and walks the other way, holding her side. The young man walks in the bank. PULL BACK and reveal, we are:
S: INT. CARGO VAN -- DAY.
N: Matt, Reggie, Macy, Alejandro, and CORY, 35, SWAT SERGEANT. Two other SWAT officers, and a MAN IN A SUIT.
C: CORY
D: Can we get in position?
C: MATT
D: When he walks out of the bank, we pull beside and you take him.
N: The young man walks out of the bank and is moving down the street. We are moving now.
C: MATT
D: Now.
E: CONT'D
C: CORY
D: Take him.
E: Into a radio
N: We see TWO PHOENIX PD VEHICLES round the corner. The van doors are thrown open and Cory and his guys are on the run. The young man turns but by the time he does, Cory has tackled him. The man in the suit, Reggie, and Macy get out. Alejandro and Matt stay in the van.
C: CORY
D: You have any weapons?
E: CONT'D
N: He's frisking him. Finds a small bag of meth, the cell phone, and the bank receipt.
C: CORY
D: Where's uh... what's his name.
E: CONT'D
C: MAN IN SUIT
D: Here.
N: He hands him the bank receipt and the man disappears inside... Cory continues digging and finds five thousand in cash on the young man.
C: CORY
D: Little walking money, sport?
N: Macy takes this all in. A crime she didn't even know existed. She walks back to the van.
C: MACY
D: You guys coming?
N: Matt shakes his head `no'.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Don't go in the bank, Kate.
C: MACY
D: This is something I can actually build a case on.
C: MATT
D: KATE --
N: She turns and walks in.
S: INT .WELLS FARGO BANK -- MOMENT LATER.
N: We hold on a PRINTOUT OF ACCOUNT ACTIVITY. Deposit. Deposit. Deposit. Deposit. Every day. The account balance around two million dollars.
C: MACY
D: These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?
C: MAN IN SUIT
D: Yeah. Look here.
N: Macy and Reggie are leaning over him.
C: MAN IN SUIT
D: Cash Deposits coming in daily, the balance transferred to a money market account in 9000 dollar increments. All cash transactions 10,000 and over must be reported to TREASURY --
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: And you can seize that.
C: MAN IN SUIT
D: Already have. I'll go through these wire transfer numbers and freeze all these accounts as well... this is a really big bust. I don't know why we've never tried this before. Who knew they just stood outside banks and robbed people, then deposited the money...
N: Macy and Reggie ask themselves the same question. A WELLS FARGO MANAGER walks over some more paperwork. The man in the suit looks it over.
C: MAN IN SUIT
D: Wow.
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: What?
C: MAN IN SUIT
D: Know what this is?
N: He shows her a printout.
C: MACY
D: No.
C: MAN IN SUIT
D: It's a bank line of credit. You make payments over what you owe and it doesn't show as cash it shows as a negative loan balance... See that?
N: He points to the loan amount. -17,453,229.26
C: MACY
D: Oh my god.
N: Macy walks out of the bank and straight to the van, Reggie right behind. She looks bewildered and scared. She climbs in next to them.
C: MACY
D: They just seized seventeen million dollars... I need that explained to me. Guillermo Diaz told you all that in an HOUR?
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: We knew where his accounts were, we just didn't know they were shaking people down in front of the fucking branch. It's a bogus bust, though. Can't prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account. An attorney will have that money back in a few months... but a lot of heads will roll before then...
C: MACY
D: We can arrest Manuel for now. At least get him off the street.
N: Heads off.
C: MATT
D: Don't you dare.
N: She turns back to them.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: We need him to get called back to Mexico. That's the objective, Kate.
C: MACY
D: That makes NO sense... We can get him off the street! RIGHT NOW. If I can tie any of these payments to--
C: MATT
D: You can't arrest him.
N: Beat.
C: MACY
D: Watch me.
N: She marches back toward the bank.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FEDERAL BUILDING -- DIRECTOR JENNING'S OFFICE -- DAY.
N: Macy and Reggie sit across from Jennings and Phil. Bob Fiske is there as well.
C: JENNINGS
D: US Attorney won't issue the warrant. I can't override--
C: MACY
D: This is ridiculous. His guys are robbing people IN FRONT OF THE BANK... So we find out where his boss lives in Mexico. Big deal. I've seen the Mexican police in action and believe me --
C: JENNINGS
D: Kate... what do you want? What would you like done here?
C: MACY
D: I would like to follow some semblance of procedure, and build a prosecutable case against --
C: JENNINGS
D: We prosecuted more felony drug cases in this region last year than in the two previous years combined. Are you feeling that on the street? You getting the `vibe' that we"re winning?
N: Beat.
C: MACY
D: No.
C: JENNINGS
D: Do you?
C: REGGIE
D: No... I don't.
C: PHIL
D: Advisors like Matt come in, stir the pot, cause these criminals to react and make mistakes. That's how we build cases against the individuals that actually make a difference in this fight. When they're nervous, when they stop trusting their crews, when they move their money... these are all opportunities to strike... that's the purpose of contractors like Matt.
C: JENNINGS
D: This isn't something I dreamed up myself, Kate. I don't have the authority to hire advisors or authorize joint agency missions. Or fly agents from air force bases, are you understanding me? These decisions are made far from here. By officials elected to office, not appointed to them... so if your fear is operating out of bounds I am telling you, you're not. The boundary has been moved. Got it?
N: She does. But that doesn't mean she likes it...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT MACY'S VEHICLE LATE AFTERNOON
N: Macy and Reggie drive in silence. Nowhere in particular... Just driving.
C: MACY
D: Where'd that guy say the safe banks were, Cave Creek?
C: REGGIE
D: Yeah?
C: MACY
D: Ever been there?
C: REGGIE
D: Don't even know where it is...
C: MACY
D: North of Scottsdale. Horse country...
C: REGGIE
D: Yeah?
C: MACY
D: Big saloon there called the Buffalo Chip... Feel like a beer somewhere far away?
C: REGGIE
D: Why? There an angle here?
C: MACY
D: Yeah. Angle is me getting drunk and forgetting about today.
C: REGGIE
D: At the Buffalo Chip? Yeah... I'll go to the Buffalo Chip. Get my two step on... Drive your drunk ass home later...
N: For the first time, we see her laugh.
C: MACY
D: Alright. To the Chip.
N: They drive North, in search of a moment's escape.
S: EXT. BUFFALO CHIP SALOON -- NIGHT.
N: Behind the saloon is a small arena, a corral to it's right. In the corral, a half dozen bulls. In the arena -- a young cowboy on a bull, hanging on for dear life. Country music blares through speakers from the beer garden just beyond... About twenty people sit on bleachers watching the bull riders, Macy and Reggie among them, drinking beer from giant cups.
C: REGGIE
D: That fool's crazy.
C: MACY
D: These guys are pros, this is where they practice.
C: REGGIE
D: This what you do? Come here trolling for rednecks...
N: Macy laughs. Reggie takes in the crowd -- lots of young blonde girls in hats and jeans two sizes too small.
C: REGGIE
D: Peckerwoods got some fine-ass women though.
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: Bet I start seeing you here weekly.
N: The next bull erupts from the chute, sending a cowboy ass over elbow...
C: REGGIE
D: I'll say this... these folks got it figured. Music's all.. bout life just... beating em, but still happy. Can't take that away from em.
E: He stamps his foot and claps
C: MACY
D: Let's go inside. I wanna dance.
C: REGGIE
D: Lit's git in thar an' boot scoot.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- DANCE FLOOR -- NIGHT.
N: Macy and Reggie have infiltrated a line dance. Reggie's interpretation is mockery, but his gun is visible, so no one's saying shit... Macy laughs, spins. Doesn't know how to line dance... feels good to move anyway. She sways, clicks her heels, and acts like a woman, for just a moment...
S: INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- BAR -- LATER.
N: Macy and Reggie sit at a long table, many beers in. They are easy together... Would be easy to make a mistake tonight and fuck up a great partnership, but they've walked this line many times before.
C: REGGIE
D: I think some of these girl's are getting drunk enough to forget they're racist.
C: MACY
D: Oh for God's sake, a Black man is president. Racism is dead, and even if it wasn't when he popped Bin Ladin he won over the hold outs.
N: A blonde thing is smiling at him.
C: REGGIE
D: Yeah, baby.
N: Reggie notices a HANDSOME COWBOY. Tall, broad shoulders...
C: REGGIE
D: I know him.
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: Who?
C: REGGIE
D: He's Phoenix PD.
C: MACY
D: Really... Invite him over.
E: Spots him
C: REGGIE
D: HEY! TED!
N: Ted turns to the sound. Seems surprised to see Reggie. Walks over. He carries what looks like a gym bag.
C: REGGIE
D: What do you got there man?
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: I rode tonight.
C: REGGIE
D: A bull? No shit?
C: TED
D: Yeah. Were you watching?
C: REGGIE
D: For a minute, how'd you do?
C: TED
D: Tossed right out of the chute. Hi.
E: Sees Macy
N: She smiles a bit. Shy even...
C: REGGIE
D: Sit down, man.
C: TED
D: Let me grab you guys some beers, what is that?
C: REGGIE
D: Anything, man.
N: He walks off.
C: MACY
D: Married?
C: REGGIE
D: All yours. In my basketball league.
C: MACY
D: Good guy?
C: REGGIE
D: He's great. Sergeant in vice. Divorced, couple kids I think...
N: Macy watches him as he orders. The girl beside him, much younger and pretty, is chatting him... He's chatting back. She retreats into her shell, feeling foolish for thinking it would be that easy to meet someone... She clouds. Reggie notices.
C: REGGIE
D: I'ma cock block that little blonde for you... gonna be a sacrifice...
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: Yeah... Thanks.
N: Reggie walks up to Ted and the girl, charms his way between and gabs them both. We see Macy, letting herself be hopeful...
S: INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- LATER.
N: Reggie, the blonde, Ted, and Macy all sit together. Ted sits beside Macy -- the battle lines are drawn for the night -- she is his. He is showing them the cinch that goes around the bull's belly.
C: TED
D: You wrap this around and then- I'll demonstrate.
E: he grabs Macy's arm
N: He wraps the nylon belt around her hand once, twice, three times...
C: REGGIE
D: I know where this is going --
C: MACY
D: Don't discourage him. Know how long it's been since someone tied me up?
N: Ted and Macy share a charged look. She smiles.
C: TED
D: Don't give me any ideas.
C: MACY
D: I'm trying very hard to give you ideas.
N: The tension of it, the flirt of it, she looks ten years younger... Alive. They hold each other's eyes, almost like a dare... He's captivated by her.
C: TED
D: I want to take you outside.
E: softly
N: There it is... Macy surrenders with a smile...
C: MACY
D: Okay.
N: They stand like school kids.
C: TED
D: Scuse us. We're just gonna...
C: REGGIE
D: Mmhmm.
C: MACY
D: Take a look around back.
C: REGGIE
D: Yeah.
C: TED
D: Watch my bag.
N: We watch them walk off through the club.
S: EXT. BUFFALO CHIP SALOON -- NIGHT.
N: We are looking at the sheet metal outer wall of the saloon. Macy's head comes hard into frame, Ted's right after. They devour each other. She tears at the snaps of his shirt, runs her hand along his chest, grabbing a handful of chest hair and pulling. He tears frantically at her pants. Gets them unbuttoned and slips his hand inside. Her head flies back in ecstacy.
C: MACY
D: What am I -- Uhh.
N: With one hand she attacks his belt and pulls at the zipper of his jeans. She reaches into his jeans. His turn to moan...
S: INT. BUFFALO CHIP -- CONT.
N: Reggie has the cinch and is toying with the blonde girl.
C: REGGIE
D: See you can also... let me show you...
N: She laughs at his attempt to do the wrap Ted did.
C: REGGIE
D: Fuck it. We'll just use these.
E: CONT'D He pulls out his handcuffs
N: She loses herself in laughter.
C: GIRL
D: Okay... Anything else fun in there?
E: she motions to Ted's bag
C: REGGIE
D: Let's see...
N: Shows her Ted's hand cuffs.
C: GIRL
D: Did you two plan this??
N: He laughs, then spots something else. At the bottom of the bag, he sees it -- A computer print out of a photo from the Wells Fargo security camera... A PHOTO OF MACY. Everything about Reggie changes.
C: REGGIE
D: Got a cell phone?
C: GIRL
D: Yeah... What?
C: REGGIE
D: Call 911. Right fucking now, call
N: Puts his badge on the table.
C: REGGIE
D: Tell them I said so. Read them the badge number.
E: CONT'D
N: And Reggie is gone. The girl starts dialing.
S: EXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- CONT.
N: MACY'S back is against the Sheet metal, Ted pressed against her. Bare legs wrapped around him. He thrusts deep inside her. It is rapid, almost angry. She needs this. Release is coming, she moans freely now, she's so close-- We see something moving toward them in a blur. Reggie's fist slams the side of Ted's face. It knocks him out of frame, exposing Macy completely naked below the waist, legs spread wide against the wall. She panics, reaching down to pull up her pants and falls over as Reggie jumps on Ted, beating him senseless.
C: REGGIE MOTHER FUCKER!!! MOTHER
D: FUUUCCCKKKERRRR!!!
E: CONT'D
N: Ted is helpless, curled into a fetal position, face broken and bleeding.
C: MACY
D: What are you doing???
N: Sirens can be heard. Reggie has Ted cuffed now and is frisking him. Knife in his boot. Pistol in the other boot.
C: REGGIE
D: He was sent here. There's surveillance photos of you IN HIS BAG!!! He works for the fucking cartel.
N: She leans against the wall, still flushed and breathing heavy, so close to orgasm, now the farthest thing from it.
C: TED
D: Reggie... pull up my pants for me?
C: REGGIE
D: FUCK YOU.
C: TED
D: You got it wrong... nothing was gonna happen... wasn't... Didn't even know she--
N: Reggie kicks him quiet. Macy starts to do something she hasn't done in a decade. She's fighting it, but sex brought so much emotion with it. And now -- no release. Try though she may, she starts to cry. Reggie goes to her and hugs her as CAVE CREEK POLICE VEHICLES pull into the parking lot, sirens blazing.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- NIGHT.
N: EVERYONE IS HERE NOW. FBI. All of them. Ted is loaded into a car. Macy rests against a SQUAD CAR, smoking a cigarette, too exhausted to care that she looks like she just got fucked outside a bar. Director Jennings walks up, leans against the car beside her.
C: JENNINGS
D: See what I mean? They try to react and make mistakes... you want a LITTLE --
C: MACY
D: No.
C: JENNINGS
D: Then keep shaking the tree. Let's see what else falls.
N: Jennings stands.
C: JENNINGS
D: Finding that photo and luring him out. That was smart.
E: CONT'D
N: His knowing smile says: our little secret. She nods in appreciation.
C: MACY
D: Thank you, Dave.
C: JENNINGS
D: Thank you. Unlike most of the perps we see, Phoenix PD officers facing thirty years in prison have plenty to lose. We'll know whatever he knows very soon.
N: Jennings walks off. Macy pulls a long drag from the cigarette. She looks at it, and must accept the fact that she is once again a smoker... Reggie walks up to her. He hands her a new pack. They look at each other. Try not to, but can't help it. They laugh... But when Macy's laughter risks turning to tears, she stops.
C: REGGIE
D: Thought all you white girls shaved.
N: She starts laughing again.
C: MACY
D: You saved my life.
C: REGGIE
D: Nah. Think he was meant to scare you, or test you, maybe...
C: MACY
D: Are they following us?
C: REGGIE
D: Don't know. They're gonna take your vehicle, look for a transmitter. Which would mean there's someone in our house involved too.
E: MORE
C: REGGIE
D: Maybe someone tailed us from the bank... I don't know.
E: CONT'D
N: The not knowing scares her.
C: MACY
D: Thank you. I mean it.
N: He accepts it with a nod.
C: MACY
D: Where is he now?
E: CONT'D
C: REGGIE
D: Backseat of your car. With our shadows.
N: Takes that in.
C: MACY
D: I hope they kill him.
C: REGGIE
D: You don't mean that.
C: MACY
D: ... No.
N: They lean against the car in silence.
S: INT. MACY'S VEHICLE -- CONT.
N: Ted sits in the backseat, face destroyed. The reality of his situation now fully in front of him. Matt sits in the front seat, Alejandro beside him.
C: TED
D: Okay. Okay. Okay...
C: MATT
D: You said that Ted.
C: TED
D: Look... I. I. I was asked what her CASE INVOLVED-
N: As quick as a cat, Alejandro stabs his thumb into Ted's eye. Ted pitches forward.
C: MATT
D: The beauty of you being so beat to shit... No one's gonna notice a couple more scratches... this is a new game, Ted.
E: MORE
C: MATT
D: I'm the guy who will decide if your daughters get Federal protection or whether we post your ex wife's address on the internet. I decide whether you go to prison at a work camp in Missouri or a kill house like Corcoran. This is where you negotiate how to survive...
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: I'm in really fucking deep here.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: How many officers do they have on the force?
C: TED
D: I don't know... How do I guarantee my family's safe?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You want the truth?
C: TED
D: Please.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Give the names, give the houses, phone numbers ... Give me all of you.
N: We watch from a distance as Matt and Alejandro listen. Matt stands and waves over the Director and other agents. They lean over and listen to Ted spilling. Ted is then removed and marched toward another vehicle. Alejandro and Matt walk toward Macy.
C: MATT
D: Good job.
N: She laughs at the conviction this lie is given by everyone.
C: MACY
D: I love how we're all going to pretend I planned this.
C: MATT
D: You write it that way in the report. Yes?
E: Looking at Reggie
C: REGGIE
D: Well ... she found the picture and led him outside.
C: MATT
D: Real quick thinking, Kate.
C: MACY
D: Yeah ... So, can I go home tonight or ...
C: MATT
D: Sure ... This is good news. They're going to call Manuel back. Soon.
C: MACY
D: Whoopee. Then we can call the Mexican police to go arrest their employer. Why do I think that won't happen?
C: MATT
D: Gotta have a little faith.
E: Matt really likes this girl
N: Matt walks off.
C: REGGIE
D: You can come stay with me.
C: MACY
D: I'll be fine... They have your picture too, you know.
C: REGGIE
D: Yeah. Thought crossed my mind.
N: Phil waves Reggie over. Macy is alone. She looks left, and Alejandro is beside her.
C: MACY
D: I understand now, okay? They're everywhere and I'll never know who to trust, as evidenced by me fucking my hit man behind a bar.
E: Dry
C: ALEJANDRO
D: He wasn't an assassin. He was just supposed to be your friend and hopefully find out who is showing you how to hurt them. They are looking for us, not you.
C: MACY
D: That doesn't scare you?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I've been doing this for a long time.
N: He looks out over the cactus.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: In Mexico, police do not investigate crimes for the government. Attorneys do. That's what I did. I was very close to arresting someone who ... someone I shouldn't have tried to arrest.
E: CONT'D
N: His mind wanders back. He remembers...
C: ALEJANDRO
D: The brilliance of what they do when they mutilate a body is make people think -- Oh, that person must have done something to receive such a death. They must have been involved.
E: CONT'D
N: He looks at her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: They must have deserved it ... And for the family ... It soils every memory you have of that person. They make it impossible to imagine the face you loved without seeing the initials carved into her forehead. Imagine her body without seeing her chest with -- remember her before...
E: CONT'D
N: He draws in a deep breath. Swallows the emotion.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Her breasts were cut off ... Remember your child without ...
E: CONT'D
N: He looks off. Can't even say it ... Won't say it.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: They kill the body, the memory, everything.
E: CONT'D
N: She shivers as she digests his words. Alejandro looks up to the stars. Studies them.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You remind me of my wife. I find it very difficult to look at you.
E: CONT'D
N: He steps away.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow they will call Manuel back, and we will cut a leg from them.
E: CONT'D
N: He walks back toward Matt, leaving Macy staring out across the desert.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY.
N: Silvio sleeps. A shadow crosses his face. He opens an eye. Eliseo stands there holding coffee and a plate of eggs and tortillas.
C: SILVIO
D: Juevos?
C: ELISEO
D: Si papa.
C: SILVIO
D: Con jalapenos?
C: ELISEO
D: Si.
N: Silvio sits up. Takes the coffee, drinks. No booze in it. Thinks about sending it back, but the look on Eliseo's face makes him reconsider. He'll get drunk soon enough. He takes the plate and feeds. Eliseo sits on the bed.
C: ELISEO
D: Trabajando hoy?
E: CONT'D
C: SILVIO
D: En la noche.
C: ELISEO
D: Quere jugar baseball? En el parque?
N: The man chews. Thinks. Exaggerates his expressions.
C: SILVIO
D: Hmmmm ... baseball.
N: The boy laughs.
C: ELISEO
D: BASEBALL!!! Si.
C: SILVIO
D: Okay.
N: The boy shoots off like a rocket. Silvio laughs. As he eats, we see the AK 47 by the bed. A bag of coke and a thousand or so dollars on the night stand.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEST WESTERN -- SCOTTSDALE -- DAY.
N: Macy and Reggie pull in and park next to five US GOVERNMENT SUBURBANS. They get out and walk past them. They get to the room and knock.
S: INT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT.
N: Matt lets them in. He wears desert camo fatigues, as do most of the people in the room. There are computers linked to monitors. One displays footage of MANUEL DIAZ'S HOUSE and OFFICE. Another is footage of the DESERT. But that footage is MOVING.
C: MATT
D: We may have the tunnel, right here.
N: We look at the footage. Cactus and desert grass in the foreground. In the background, a ravine.
C: MATT
D: We'll know soon enough.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DESERT -- CONTINUOUS.
N: We look at cactus and brush along a ridge. Slowly, caterpillar slow, the brush begins moving. We can just make out an enormous telephoto lens wrapped in camouflage tape.
S: INT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT.
N: Matt points to coolers filled with Gatorade and Red Bull.
C: MATT
D: Tasty beverage?
E: CONT'D
N: This guy ...
C: MACY
D: What's the plan?
C: MATT
D: Going hunting.
E: Easy smile
N: There is a DOD AGENT wearing headphones and sitting in front of what looks like a sound board linked to a computer. From the other room, DELTA and one of his team members walk through. Moving toward the TOPO MAP on the wall.
C: DELTA
D: Alright. Listen up. We're waiting for visual confirmation to move, so let's clarify the op. We will drive to this location. Proceed on foot to this ridge.
N: He moves to a diagram of a tunnel.
C: DELTA
D: This diagram is based on other tunnels that have been mapped. This is NOT accurate, it is for reference only. We expect a small exit corridor on our side of the border. They mark the international border in the tunnel with red paint so Border Patrol doesn't pursue past that point. Once on the Mexican side, there will be a small staging area, then another shaft will lead to the main warehouse and the road that returns to Mexico. Once we clear the mules, we don't expect more than a dozen bandits.
E: CONT'D
N: DELTA looks at Matt.
C: DELTA
D: Wanna discuss ROE?
E: CONT'D
C: MATT
D: We'll save that for later.
C: DELTA
D: This is an in and out. We are clearing and placing an agent.
E: MORE
C: DELTA
D: Once we've cleared the tunnel and dropped the agent, DEA will take over the scene. Alright?
E: CONT'D
N: An operator watching a monitor speaks.
C: OPERATOR
D: This looks like confirmation.
N: We look at the monitor and see a large amount of brush, and behind it, an old wrecked car entangled in it.
C: DELTA
D: That looks like it. Okay, let's gear up. Got a good drive ahead of us.
N: They begin breaking down gear, pulling maps from the walls. Matt turns to an agent.
C: MATT
D: First thing, get that surveillance van operational.
C: OPERATOR
D: I need to fit your guy with a locator.
C: MATT
D: Do it.
N: The agent takes off. Macy and Reggie's heads are spinning.
C: REGGIE
D: Those guys are Special Ops. Are we going on this?
E: To Matt
N: Matt turns to them.
C: MATT
D: You aren't really dressed for it.
C: REGGIE
D: Well, you didn't fucking tell us.
C: MATT
D: You went crying to daddy yesterday. We don't want daddy to know everything. Loose lips sink ships, haven't you learned that yet? Don't worry, we got extra--
C: MACY
D: We have tac gear in our car.
N: Alejandro steps into the room. Dressed in head to toe black. Face painted as well.
C: MACY
D: Jesus.
E: CONT'D
N: She notices Alejandro's gear. Ear piece. Silenced HK Mark 23, tactical vest. Night vision goggles. No one else is dressed like him. The operator straps what looks to be a wrist watch on Alejandro's arm.
C: REGGIE
D: What the fuck is he dressed for?
C: MATT
D: Relax. You guys will hang back when we get there, k?
C: REGGIE
D: Then why are we going?
C: MACY
D: Because CIA can't operate within US borders without a domestic agency attached. Right?
N: At last. She gets it. He smiles.
C: MATT
D: Hey. All the drugs we find, you guys get to confiscate. Gonna be a big day.
N: He walks off.
C: MACY
D: That's why we're here. That's the only reason.
N: Reggie shakes his head.
C: REGGIE
D: Great.
N: He walks out.
S: EXT. ARIZONA DESERT -- HIGHWAY 86 -- DAY.
N: Five suburbans and a large cargo van drive down the desolate highway as the sun begins to set.
S: INT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- NOGALES, MEXICO -- DAY.
N: Silvio sits in his little courtyard, watching the chickens. He tosses a handful of feed and they scamper after it. He drinks a beer. Three empties beside him. He looks at his watch. It's time. He gets up.
S: EXT. STASH HOUSE -- NOGALES -- DAY.
N: Three state Police Vehicles. One being loaded full of bricks of marijuana. Silvio stands beside the car, smoking.
S: INT. US GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN -- DAY.
N: Matt sits in the front seat. A Delta operator driving. Macy, Reggie, Alejandro and three Delta operators sit in the back. Matt is on his cell.
C: MATT
D: What. What. What's he saying?
C: VOICE
D: Um. Hold on... They called him back. He's on the road now.
C: MATT
D: Where.
C: VOICE
D: Turning left on Scottsdale. You got about three hours and he'll be across.
N: Matt turns back to the Delta operators.
C: MATT
D: We're gonna have to hit the tunnel the minute we get on the ground.
N: Matt looks at Macy and Reggie.
C: MATT
D: Pretty exciting, huh?
E: CONT'D
N: They don't share his enthusiasm. They just want this to be over.
S: INT. RANGE ROVER -- DAY.
N: Manuel is sweating, even though the AC blasts in his face. On the seat beside him is an overnight bag.
S: EXT. INTERSTATE 10 -- PHOENIX -- DAY.
N: We watch Manuel's Range Rover get on the interstate.
C: VOICE
D: He's on I 10, travelling southeast...
S: EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- LATE AFTERNOON.
N: A MEXICAN STATE POLICE VEHICLE ambleS down the road, heading toward the tunnel...
S: INT. POLICE VEHICLE -- MEXICAN ROAD -- CONTINUOUS.
N: Silvio drives, marijuana bundles fill the backseat. He smokes a cigarette, he slows down, pulls off the pavement.
S: EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- CONTINUOUS.
N: We watch from a distance as Silvio's vehicle bounces down a dirt road, disappearing into the desert as the sun hides behind the horizon.
S: INT. US GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN -- NIGHT.
N: We pull off the highway and stop. A man in a ghillie suit stands up, walks toward them carrying a camera with an 800mm lens. Matt turns toward us.
C: MATT
D: On foot from here.
S: EXT. TRANSPORT VEHICLE -- CONT.
N: Macy steps out and sees another vehicle parked. Another half dozen men in full camo. From the back of the Suburban, six duffel bags are opened. Operators reach in and grab weapons, magazines, grenades. Generation 4 night vision goggles are passed to everyone. DELTA walks up to Reggie and Macy.
C: DELTA
D: Keep your fucking safeties on and the barrels pointed down. Stay in the back and don't shoot anyone on my fucking team, got it?
N: Doesn't wait for a reply.
C: REGGIE
D: We HAVE done this before.
C: MACY
D: I don't think we've done THIS.
N: They move out. We watch the world through NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. We run a bit then kneel down. We are flagged forward. Kneel down. We leap frog this way forever. Macy looks out over the desert. TWO COYOTES(the animals), are stopped, staring right at us. Macy makes eye contact. They begin trotting off, never breaking eye contact with Macy, as though they are begging her to follow. While she still can... We come to a rise. Everyone lays down. DELTA whispers to Alejandro.
C: DELTA
D: Rules of engagement on this deal?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I don't use those. Ask Matt.
N: DELTA turns the other way.
C: DELTA
D: Rules of engagement?
C: MATT
D: Weapons free, my friend.
N: He whispers it down the line. Reggie's eyes scream `what the fuck'. We drop into a ravine and follow it. Up ahead we see the brush and the old car that is hood first in the ground, like it was dropped from the sky. The team lines up across from it.
C: MATT
D: Where is the target?
E: CONT'D Into mouthpiece
C: VOICE
D: Bout twenty minutes to the border.
C: MATT
D: We need to boogie. And we need to do it quiet till we find the center.
E: To Delta
N: Delta pulls his knife. Alejandro comes up to the front.
C: MATT
D: Good luck.
E: CONT'D
N: Alejandro nods. He and the Delta operators move ahead, silently. Disappear behind the old car. After a moment we follow. We enter the tunnel. Moving fast.
S: INT. TUNNEL -- CONT.
N: We pass the body of a SMUGGLER, throat slit. We continue. A shaft banks left, we follow... Another body lies on the ground, throat slit, though eyes wide open, bleeding out and staring up at us as we pass. We see the operators ahead. DELTA backtracks to Matt.
C: DELTA
D: So we're clear, I don't need to announce. Weapons free.
E: whispers
C: MATT
D: They don't get freer buddy.
N: The operator moves forward, whispers to his group. They all pull out their 1911 pistols and attach silencers.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Take the left shaft ... Make noise.
N: DELTA returns his pistol to it's holster, raises his rifle. His men follow suit.
C: DELTA
D: Don't want us with you?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: No. Draw them to you. The one I am looking for will try and run.
N: The operators move into the left chamber, Alejandro moves off to the right. Matt holds Macy and Reggie up. Points to the ceiling: RED PAINT ALL THE WAY AROUND.
C: MATT
D: Cross this and it's new rules.
N: She takes the dare.
C: MACY
D: Fair enough.
N: Matt moves down the left shaft.
C: REGGIE
D: Fuck are we doing in here? Let's go back.
N: Machine gun fire erupts. The fight has begun.
C: REGGIE
D: We're in fucking Mexico!!
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: THEN GO BACK.
N: He'll never leave her. As he moves up the tunnel, Macy looks right, toward the shaft Alejandro took. Can't resist.
C: MACY
D: REGGIE!
E: CONT'D
N: He's too far ahead to hear. She heads down Alejandro's path anyway. GUNFIRE ECHOES FROM EVERYWHERE.
S: INT. TUNNEL WAREHOUSE -- CONT.
N: We find SILVIO, and he is panicking, throwing the marijuana from his car to the ground. Another man runs up and helps.
C: SILVIO
D: RAPIDO RAPIDO!!!
N: They hear more gunfire. Screw it. Silvio's not waiting around any longer. He gets in the driver's seat.
C: BANDIT
D: Traiga me contigo!!!
C: SILVIO
D: No cabron!
N: The man opens the passenger door as Silvio starts the squad car. A bullet penetrates the bandit's face, just under the eye. He drops as if he's been unplugged. Silvio ducks down, throwing the car in reverse, but a hand reaches in the window, and turns the car off. Silvio looks up and sees -- Alejandro. HE pulls Silvio from the car. Spins him around. Pulls the pistol from Silvio's belt. Tosses it on the ground. Silvio stares at Alejandro in absolute terror.
C: SILVIO
D: El Medellin.
E: CONT'D
N: Alejandro places his pistol to Silvio's face.
C: SILVIO
D: No me mata!!
E: CONT'D
N: Alejandro jams his thumb in Silvio's larynx. Silvio gasps for air. Alejandro grabs his hair, pistol to his head.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: What you do now is for your family. Whether they see tomorrow rests with you.
E: SUBTITLE
N: Tears roll down Silvio's cheek.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You will drive me.
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: WHAT ARE YOU DOING??
E: O.S.
N: Alejandro turns and sees Macy, her rifle trained on him.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Put that down.
C: MACY
D: STEP AWAY. I mean it. Move away from him.
N: He looks at her. The automatic fire from different tunnel shafts rushes in and out like blasts of hot air.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: We are in Mexico now. You have no jurisdiction.
C: MACY
D: We can't be here--
N: Alejandro raises his pistol and fires six rounds into Macy's chest. She collapses to the ground, sucking for air. Alejandro walks over and grabs her rifle. Tosses it in the back of the Police car.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Don't ever point a weapon at me again. Get your breath and go back to the surface.
N: She gasps, clasping at the Kevlar vest that saved her life. She rolls onto her stomach and struggles to stand. Reaches for her pistol. Alejandro slams her face into his knee. Tosses her pistol across the room.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Stop it Kate. Just stop. This is what we were sent here to do.
E: CONT'D
N: He pulls her to her feet. Points his pistol at her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I don't have time. Go to the surface. Now.
E: CONT'D
N: Blood pours from her shattered nose. She has lost and she knows it.
C: MACY
D: You lured Manuel to Mexico so you could kill him. This is your cab driver.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I am here to kill the man with the power to summon Manuel Diaz. I am here for Fausto. But I will kill Manuel too. It's what I do, Kate. Go. Or I will do it to you.
N: She stumbles back, turns around and runs.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Get in.
E: CONT'D Turning the gun on Sylvio
N: Alejandro gets in the back seat of the police car.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Drive back to Mexico.
E: CONT'D
N: The car backs up, spins and drives the tunnel road until we ARE:
S: EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- NIGHT.
N: We are in the backseat, looking through the windshield.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I am through, do you have my location?
E: CONT'D Into mouthpiece
C: VOICE
D: Copy. We have you. Target is east and north of you. Looks like highway 56 to 17 will intercept him if he stays on 17. Will advise. Go east on 56 off highway 2.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Este a calle cinquinta y seis.
E: TO SILVIO
C: SYLVIO
D: I have a son... I... have a son.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Having family... does that save the lives of the men you are hired to kill? Hmm?
N: Sylvio stares in the rearview mirror at the phantom ducked low behind him.
S: EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT.
N: Reggie looks around, doesn't see Macy anywhere. Spots Matt among the Delta team.
C: MATT
D: Is he through?
E: Into mouthpiece
C: VOICE
D: Copy. GPS is transmitting. Audio is transmitting. Should intercept in
N: Matt pats DELTA on the back.
C: MATT
D: This was a clean, clean fucking op my friend.
N: Delta points back toward the approaching Reggie.
C: DELTA
D: Except for these assholes. Like it better overseas where we don't have baby sitters.
N: Reggie reaches them.
C: REGGIE
D: You see Kate?
C: MATT
D: She's not with you?
N: Beat.
C: REGGIE
D: We gotta go back.
N: Matt sighs.
C: MATT
D: Okay, let's go. We're missing one.
E: Yells to the team
N: Delta rolls his eyes. They approach the tunnel entrance when Macy walks out. She spots Matt and punches him for all she's worth. He deflects it, sweeps her leg and she hits the ground. Hard. Reggie rushes him.
C: REGGIE
D: Hey man, what the --
N: He is grabbed and flung to the ground by DELTA. He holds Reggie's face to the ground with his boot. Rifle pointed at him.
C: DELTA
D: Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.
N: Reggie struggles for even a breath much less a response. Matt grabs Macy and pulls her back into the tunnel.
C: MACY
D: He's an assassin. A government ASSASSIN--
C: MATT
D: Our government doesn't have assassins. We farm that out.
C: MACY
D: Who is Medellin?? What is that?
C: MATT
D: Refers to a time when one group controlled every aspect of the drug trade. Providing a measure of order. That we can control.
E: MORE
C: MATT
D: And until someone figures out how to convince 20 percent of the US population to stop smoking and snorting this shit, order is the best we can hope for... Alejandro is working to return that order.
E: CONT'D
C: MACY
D: He works for the cartels in Colombia... He works for the fucking competition.
C: MATT
D: He works for whoever points him toward the people that made him, Kate. Us, them, anyone that will turn him loose.
N: He stands close to her.
C: MACY
D: Get away from me.
C: MATT
D: Take a breath and --
N: She pushes him hard.
C: MACY
D: Fucking kill me or get out of my way.
N: He looks at her. Takes a step back.
C: MATT
D: Long walk back to Phoenix.
C: MACY
D: I'll manage.
N: She walks out of the tunnel toward Reggie. DELTA removes his boot and walks away.
C: MACY
D: Let's go.
E: CONT'D
N: Helicopters can be heard. In the distance, sirens are approaching. Macy and Reggie walk away from the scene.
C: REGGIE
D: What just happened?
C: MACY
D: They woke me up. Showed me the whole thing.
C: REGGIE
D: And?
C: MACY
D: And I quit.
N: They continue to walk, sirens racing toward them.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR NIGHT
N: Far ahead, we see TAIL LIGHTS. Silvio's labored breathing gives rhythm to the racing vehicle. Alejandro stays low in the back seat.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: This is the target ahead? Confirm.
E: Into mouthpiece
C: VOICE
D: Copy. Black Range Rover, 60 meters ahead.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Put on your lights. Pull the car over.
N: He flips on his siren.
S: INT. MANUEL'S RANGE ROVER -- CONT.
N: He sees the siren.
C: MANUEL
D: What the fuck. Want to bribe me, eh.
N: He reaches for his pistol, puts it in his lap.
S: INT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR -- CONT.
N: The range Rover pulls over. Us right behind it. Silvio is breathing even heavier, if that's possible. So many ways this can go wrong...
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Use the speaker. Tell him to get out of the car.
N: Silvio grabs the radio handset, flips the switch, and his voice comes through the speaker on the roof of the car.
C: SILVIO
D: Afuera del carro!!
S: INT. RANGE ROVER -- CONT.
C: MANUEL
D: This mother fucker...
N: He sticks the pistol in his waistband. Opens the car door. Steps out.
S: INT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR -- CONT.
N: We watch Manuel through the windshield. He is standing in the road.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Tell him to raise his shirt and turn around.
C: SILVIO
D: Levanta su camisa.
C: MANUEL
D: You know who I am? HUH??
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Tell him to do it or you will shoot him where he stands.
C: SILVIO
D: Voy a matarse cabron. Levanta tu camisa.
N: Manuel does it. We see the pistol.
C: SILVIO
D: Tira la pistola en la tierra.
E: CONT'D
N: Manuel throws his pistol in the dirt.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Look how good you are at pretending to be a police officer. Out of the car. Now.
S: EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- CONT.
N: Headlights blind Manuel, but he can see the car door has opened, and an image is moving toward him. He waits, for the fool who is robbing the wrong mother fucker. As the image reaches Manuel, something moves from behind it. Fast. An arm reaches around Manuel and two shots are fired from a silenced pistol. Now the pistol is held to the back of Manuel's head.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Walk back to your car.
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: MANUEL
D: Who was he?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: A mule. Like you.
N: Alejandro fires a round into Manuel's calf. He wails in pain. He fires another round into his right hand as it hits the asphalt. He screams louder.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: In the leg so you don't run. In the hand so you don't try to fight and make me have to kill you yet.
E: CONT'D
C: MANUEL
D: You know... who .. The.. I AM A JEFE!!!
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I know who you are, Manuel. You are no jefe, but you will drive me to one...
N: Alejandro kneels down, and for the first time, Manuel can see his face.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: If you try anything, if you betray me, your daughters will burp the semen of twenty men with their last breath. Do you understand me?
E: CONT'D
N: Manuel's eyes go wide. He nods.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Get in.
E: CONT'D
N: Alejandro opens the back door before letting Manuel get in the front. In an instant, Manuel is in the driver's seat and Alejandro seated behind. The doors are closed and the Range Rover disappears down the road. We are left with Silvio, gasping, struggling, like a fish tossed thoughtlessly on the beach, as he flops helplessly on the empty road.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FAUSTO ALARCON ESTATE -- NIGHT.
N: We near an isolated estate. We turn off the main road to a private road that leads a mile or so onto Fausto's hacienda. As the large house comes into view. VEHICLES can be seen parked in front. We approach a car along the road, a man sitting on the hood. Manuel rolls his window down.
C: MANUEL
D: Soy Manuel Diaz.
C: GUARD
D: Si, te conosco. El Jefe esta esperando.
N: The rear window rolls down. A pistol comes out. A silenced round is fired into the face of the man. He falls back on the hood.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Drive.
C: MANUEL
D: What happens when we get to the house?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You get out and walk toward them.
C: MANUEL
D: What will happen to me?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: What you do now is for your family. There is no you.
C: MANUEL
D: You think you are so different?
C: ALEJANDRO
D: No. Not anymore. Now I am the same. Turn the car a bit more to the left.
N: The car stops. THREE MEN stand in the driveway with automatic rifles. The Range Rover is parked so the right headlight is pointed directly toward them. Manuel opens the door and we are--
S: EXT. FUASTO ESTATE -- CONT.
N: Manuel walks toward the men -- looking for a way out of this. GUARD 2 Senor, buenos noches.
C: MANUEL
D: CUIDADO HOMBRES--
N: Alejandro takes his pistol and presses the silenced barrel to the top of manuel's head, pulling the trigger and driving Manuel into the ground like a nail. As Manuel's body drops, Alejandro fires on all three men -- hitting them all in the head, killing them instantly. He walks to the front door, opens it...
S: INT. FAUSTO ESTATE -- CONT.
N: A man rounds the corner into the main foyer and without slowing down, Alejandro touches the barrel to his forehead and fires. We can hear the sound of talking in another room. Alejandro moves to it.
S: INT FAUSTO'S KITCHEN/ DINING ROOM
N: FAUSTO, 50's, graying hair. Big belly. Sits at the head of the table. JACINTA, 30's trophy wife, sits beside him gulping wine. They have three CHILDREN, two girls and a boy. A woman in her 60's cooks in the kitchen.
C: JACINTA
D: RAPIDO, MAMA!, tengo hambre!
N: Alejandro walks into the room, presses his foot against Jacinta's side, and launches her out of frame, then sits next to Fausto, presses the gun to his shoulder and fires. The children scream. Mama turns, Alejandro points the gun at her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: SIENTATE! AQUI!!
N: She comes around and sits as ordered. Jacinta stands up.
C: FAUSTO
D: He'll kill you. Stay still.
E: SUBTITLE
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Your children speak English?
E: SUBTITLE
C: FAUSTO
D: No.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Then we will spare them. I interrupted dinner. Please... Continue.
N: Fausto stares at him.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Every night, you have families killed, and yet you dine. Tonight should be no different.
E: CONT'D
N: Points the pistol at him.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Eat.
E: CONT'D
N: He slowly fills a fork, puts it in his mouth. Tells his children to do the same. They chew their meal and cry. Alejandro turns to the old woman.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Take the children away from here.
E: CONT'D
N: She rises and hurries the children out of the dining area.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You. Whore. Sit over there.
E: CONT'D Points the gun at Jacinta
N: She sits. Alejandro turns to Fausto, notices he has stopped eating. Picks up a fork and stabs it into Fausto's hand. Fausto screams.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You're not finished. Eat...
E: CONT'D
N: Fausto forces down another bite, rests his trembling hand on the table.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I will give you a choice, Fausto, one I was not given... You may choose to die tonight or live with the shame of having the mother of your children take your place...
E: CONT'D
N: He looks at Fausto. Fausto stops chewing. Processes what was just said.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Yes ... Choose.
E: CONT'D
N: Fausto looks at Jacinta. Her eyes say, "Goodbye my brave love"... Never dawns on her what he's thinking.
C: FAUSTO
D: I take shame.
N: She's stunned. Tears run her heavy make up. She looks to Alejandro. No mercy there. Back to her husband.
C: FAUSTO
D: I love me more. I'm sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: He isn't. It wasn't a hard decision. She turns to Alejandro. Holds her chin high in defiance.
C: JACINTA
D: Do it. You fuck. Chinga tu madre PUNTA CABRON ANDALE PUES!!!
N: Alejandro looks at Fausto.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: See why you married her. Spunk.
N: Alejandro looks into Fausto's uncaring eyes. Alejandro fires into Fausto's belly. Touches the barrel to his arm, fires again. Fausto screams. Alejandro presses the barrel to Fausto's throat, fires again. Fausto falls to the floor, gargling.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Watch death come for you. Watch. The devil is near, Fausto. He is waiting for you.
E: CONT'D
N: Fausto's terrified eyes stare back at Alejandro as he gasps for air. Drowning in his own blood. There is no specific moment when death comes. He simply fades. Alejandro sits back down.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: This is what they think of you. You see?
E: CONT'D
N: She stares at him, shaking so profusely you might think she is freezing to death.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Maybe you have enough pride that you don't marry another one of these. Maybe you take his money and go hide and raise your children far from here. Maybe your son grows up to be a doctor. And I don't have to come back and kill him some day.
E: CONT'D
N: Alejandro walks out, leaving Jacinta shivering alone at the dinner table.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY.
N: A shadow falls over an empty bed. Eliseo stands there... this has never happened before. He walks down the hall to the kitchen. His mother is in the same place, cooking. But the look in her eyes is anger. She knows he is dead. And may God damn him for making her be the one to tell their son. He stands there. Staring at his mother.
C: ELISEO
D: Mama?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- DAY.
N: Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, she sits on the balcony, takes a drag of her cigarette. Looks at it.
C: MACY
D: Three days ago I hadn't had you in ten years... fucker.
N: She leans back and looks out over Phoenix as the sun sets. She exhales ... looks at the cigarette.
C: MACY
D: You're the only one who understands me.
E: CONT'D Half joking
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I think maybe, it will be the thing that kills us all ... as a people, you know?
E: O.S.
N: Macy leaps up as if she's on fire, falls over her chair, comes up with her pistol. He moves so fast there is no time to react. In an instant, he has the gun and removes the magazine, disassembles the slide, and tosses the pieces on the table. She screams and rushes him. He spins her and pushes her back.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Stop it.
E: CONT'D
N: He moves to her and gently touches her face, looking at the gash on her nose. She is frozen in fear.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: That will scar. I'm sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: She breathes heavy, trying to remain calm. He begins lifting her shirt. She struggles and he grabs her throat. She looks into his eyes and it is a killer looking back.
C: MACY
D: Please.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Let me look ... Move your hand.
N: She surrenders, turns her head to the side. He lifts her shirt above her bare breasts. Six large, red welts...
C: ALEJANDRO
D: These ribs are bruised, but not broken, yes?
E: CONT'D
N: She nods as her lip quivers. Clinging desperately to her dignity. She has never felt so powerless, and that is his point. He drops her shirt and steps back. She crosses her arms, feeling very weak. Alejandro sits across from her.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: I would recommend not standing on balconies for a little while.
E: CONT'D
N: She doesn't move.
C: MACY
D: You're an assassin.
N: Beat.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: In Mexico, the killers are called Sicarios... The word comes from the zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who hunted the Romans that invaded their homeland... They don't deserve the term.
C: MACY
D: You are a Sicario.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: Policing them does nothing. They must be killed. Wherever they are found. They will make every place they touch Juarez. Now ... Now you understand how far we have fallen.
N: He studies her-- arms crossed, legs close together.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: You look like a girl when you're scared. Such beauty in you when you let yourself be frail. Like the daughter they took from me ... This is not the work for you. Look at yourself, Kate. What it has done to you in just three days ... Find a little town far from the border. A place where the rule of law still exists. You will spot predators there very easy now... Make a difference you can see everyday. Because you will not survive here. You are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves now.
E: CONT'D
N: He looks at her. Smiles sadly and leaves. She waits. Starts to cry, fights it back. Begins frantically reassembling the pistol. Rams the magazine in and racks a round. Comes around the corner. Enters the house. Looks around. Checks every room, panting, shaking. He is gone. She stands there and sobs...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. NOGALES STREET -- DAY.
N: The mother walks with Eliseo, dressed for soccer. Down the empty street. Sirens in the distance.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: We like to think if we cut the head from the snake, the serpent will die...
E: V.O.
N: They round the corner. We follow them to a park. Weeds cut short to look like grass. Little boys dressed in uniforms, parents sitting in lawn chairs. A referee. Just people, desperately trying to enjoy the life they have been given.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: But there is no snake. They are worms. When you cut the head, a new one grows. From both segments ... We cannot question if the end justifies the means because there is no end to consider...
E: V.O.
N: Eliseo runs to join his team. Whatever his mother told him, it wasn't the truth.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: This is the price of our self indulgence. Our weakness ... Our appetite. They are our demons, our creation.
E: V.O.
N: The mother sits on the ground, watching the boys. Running. Playing. Being children. The referee blows a whistle. The boys assume their positions on the field. The forwards line up, facing each other. Eliseo is dead center, the team's star. The referee sets the ball in place... -- GUNFIRE RIPS THROUGH THE MORNING. Everyone stops and stares in the direction of the gunfire. It is very still. People frozen like deer in a field -- weighing the risk. No more shooting. The morning is quiet again.
C: ALEJANDRO
D: There is a moment in each person's life. A choice. Do what feels good... Do what is good. Make the wrong choice enough, and it is not presented again... then all choices are bad. And the consequences worse. There is no war on drugs. Only war. The enemy we fight? Ourselves ...
N: The referee blows the whistle and sets the ball down. The game begins. Eliseo swipes it and kicks it out of frame, the other boys chasing him... THE END.
