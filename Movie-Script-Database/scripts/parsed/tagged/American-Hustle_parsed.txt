S: INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: He drives over the Triborough Bridge.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD

E: V.O.
S: INT./EXT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his house --
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: We talk ourselves into things. We sell ourselves things we maybe don't even need or want by dressing them up. We leave out the risk. We leave out the ugly truth.
E: V.O.
S: INT. IRV'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Irv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball -- that is taped to the refrigerator.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Pay attention to that because we're all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life.
E: V.O.
N: Irv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes -- with low sounds now of O.S. TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it -- Irv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY.

E: V.O.
S: INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: DANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks over his shoulder.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: He had adopted her son.
E: V.O.
C: DANNY
D: DADDY!
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: He was a really good dad and I respected him for that. It was a tough situation for everyone.
E: V.O.
N: Irv's face lights up.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Danny. This is a fantastic picture. What did you do today?
C: DANNY
D: That kid Donovan is being mean to me.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: The big kid? I thought Mommy picked you up so he couldn't bother you.
C: DANNY
D: She was late, and then after we put out the fire, mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards.
N: Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his face and puts them on.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What fire?
C: DANNY
D: Did you know they make a lamp that has the sun in it? [Irv looks at him] Mommy got the lamp. She made her special drink and the lamp made a fire.
N: Irv looks concerned.
S: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Irv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her face is burned.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I put out the fire. The fire is out.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: For the first time in my life I do the right thing.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Oh shut up --
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I save a young single mother, and her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: You fell in love! Don't forget we fell madly in love!
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Yes, I fell in love. My God, I fell in love. Yes. But you know what? I thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach. I mean, I'm dying here! And you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you. You're young, you're beautiful. You gotta find somebody else. You gotta go out and get some friends all right? Don't sit inside --
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I don't like going out. You know that I get anxiety when I have to meet people. You know how hard that is.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp. Alright? And I can't-- I mean, look, I can't trust you with it anyway. That fire and everything. I can't trust to leave you with Danny.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I put the fire out Irving! There is no fire! Maybe if you were here more, then there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if I was here?
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Just stop with the whole fire thing. God it was a mistake. I'm sure a million people do that all the time. Those sun lamps are dangerous. Shouldn't even have them in the house, really. I bet that happens all the time. This was nothing.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: We're not happy. Alright?
N: Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying nothing.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: You know that I could take Danny. You know that most of your work is illegal. And you know that if you tried to divorce me, you know that-- I'm not saying that I would, but I'm saying that I could. And I'm saying that that is why I don't like divorce, Irving. Women do that in divorces. Women get the children, and then the fathers never see them. My mother never got divorced. My grandmother never got divorced. There are NO divorces in my family. I am not getting a divorce.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Come on. What are we doing here?
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: We fight and we fuck and that's what we do. That's our thing.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: She was the Piccaso of passive aggressive karate. She was better than any con artist I'd ever met including myself. And she had me like nobody had me.
E: V.O.
N: Rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Irving, come to mama. Come on.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You might say she was my karma for how I took advantage of people.
E: V.O.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Irving, come here. Come on. Get into bed.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Alright.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Baby, there's such good stuff here.
S: INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: DANNY SITS PLAYING ON THE BED WITH HIS TOYS.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I did not want to leave the kid behind. He was my son. She had me. I was her mark.
E: V.O.
S: INT. LONDON ASSOCIATES - DAY
N: SLOW PUSH IN FROM WIDE SHOT BEHIND NEW CLIENT/MARK, FROM THE BACK, AS THEY SIT FACING EDITH, TO ONE SIDE, AND IRV, BEHIND THE DESK. CAMERA KEEPS PUSHING IN SLOWLY TOWARD THE BACK OF THE MARK'S HEAD AS HE FACES SYD AND IRV. WE NOW SEE THE MARK: A charismatic, mercurial, wild eyed BUSINESSMAN "MORT PAPIERMAN" in need of a loan. Mort's eyes go from her knees to her eyes -- His eyes meet Sydney's -- he looks soulful, open. She stares at him. Irv notices uncomfortably. He's JEALOUS.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: -- and every deal I take, I close. However, my fee is non refundable, just like my time.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: I want to thank you very much Irving for seeing me. Sorry I'm so nervous.
E: filling out paper work
N: Richie reaches for his top button to adjust it.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: Am I not buttoned?
E: CONT'D
N: Edith stares at him and smiles.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: I just gotta say Mr. Rosenfeld, that Lady Edith was very adamant that you were top notch and --
E: CONT'D
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: That's correct.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: I really need your help. I'm desperate. I've got the Audis for collateral and the two boats, and I forgot to mention that I have a little piece of real estate in Long Island.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: No, you didn't mention that. Two lunches and you never mentioned that.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: Oh, I was gonna mention it and then the guy with the hat walked in.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: The hat.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: And I forgot totally. It was the second time we had lunch.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You couldn't see his eyes. He had no eyes. It was like, did he make it?
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: Do they sell hats like that? Where do they come from? Actually, I went to the store that I thought maybe he bought it there. I was gonna get you one --
E: laughing
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You were going to get me one?
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: Like as a memento.
N: Irving decides to interject.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Two lunches?
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Yes. It's two lunches. What's the big deal?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: That's unusual.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: I was trying to get him to be more aggressive. On his loan that is.
N: Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO You showed me a whole new side of the city I'd never seen before.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Oh, good. You're welcome.
N: Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO No, thank you.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Yeah, right. You liked it? Should I take you there?
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Yes.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Should I take you there twice?
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Stop.
N: IRVING MOTIONS SYDNEY TO COME CLOSE HE WHISPERS CONFIDENTIALLY TO HER.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What's going on, you like this guy?
E: confidential to Edith
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Yes I like this guy.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Is that messing up your judgement? Don't be stupid.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: No, he's not messing with my judgment.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Hey, play your part.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Fine. You play your part.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: Take it to your people in London. Please, take it to them. I got the cashier's check right here. I give you five and you give me fifty right back, right? Please. Please don't reject me. Give a guy a chance.
E: holds out cashiers check
N: MORT/RICHIE REPEATEDLY TRIES TO HAND IT TO IRV, WHO IS BUSY STARING AT SYDNEY STARING AT MORT. MORT HOLDS THE CHECK IN THE AIR UNCOMFORTABLY AWKWARDLY UNTIL -- almost in slow motion --Edith takes the check -- staring at Mort. IRV STARTS TO LEAVE -
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: Zurich? You got an office in Zurich? Paris? I can call Paris?
E: CONT'D
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: If you could excuse me for one second?
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: Yeah, take your time. Do whatever you need to do. Go ahead, take your time.
N: HE HEADS TO THE REAR EXIT WHILE SYD MOVES TO ANOTHER -- IRV OPENS THE DOOR - BAM -- A WARRANT IS HELD UP TO HIS FACE BY STOCKY FBI AGENT SCHMIDT IN A SUIT - HE WALKS IRV BACK INTO THE OFFICE -- AS Edith OPENS A SIDE DOOR -- BANG - FEDERAL AGENT STOCK WALKS HER BACK INTO THE OFFICE WITH A WARRANT.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You got the wrong office, you're gonna be embarrassed.
N: THE AGENTS START PUTTING EDITH IN CUFFS IMMEDIATELY.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: HEY, HEY, HEY! GO EASY ON HER.
E: CONT'D
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: I may not have you, Irving, but I have her on fraud. Impersonating another individual.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Fraud?! Fraud? What is that? Identity fraud?
N: AGENTS SCHMIDT AND STOCK IMMEDIATELY START TAKING BOXES OF FILES FROM DRAWERS, IMPOUNDING EVIDENCE.
C: MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
D: You may be from England, Edith, but you're not royal and you have no banking connections and that's a felony. How long is that? That's 3- 5 years I think.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Hey! Not so tight!
E: about the handcuffs
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Oh really? That's interesting. I don't even know your real name.
N: Richie pulls out a badge and shoves it in Irving's face.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet you.
N: Richie looks at Edith with concern and points at Irving.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: You gotta get away from this guy.
E: CONT'D
N: Agents take boxes of files out of the office- Irv standing alone in center of room- shell-shocked.
S: INT. FBI HOLDING OFFICES - DAY.
N: SYDNEY IS LED INTO A HOLDING CELL BY AN FBI AGENT.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: He wouldn't let me see her for three days. He even managed to delay a lawyer.
E: V.O.
S: INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - DAY
N: Dim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights on. Edith looks like she's coming apart -- circles under her eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: She couldn't handle it.
E: V.O.
S: INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - NIGHT
N: FLUORESCENT LIGHTS COME ON IN THE CELL -- Edith squints. Cell is unlocked by Richie Dimaso WHO enters with a cup and saucer of tea. He stands near her with the tea.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Joe, how come the fluorescents are on? Can we kill that, please? Jesus I put this lamp here for you 'cause I thought it'd be better for you. There's a wire here. They're scared because people hang themselves but I know you're too smart for that. Where's the table and chair? There's no bed here? It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is everybody off today? Jesus Christ it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare you. I don't know. Maybe it was my idea. Maybe i'm a little off the beaten path you know? I don't know. You look dehydrated. Here, want to try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips are all chapped. It's herbal. My favorite.
E: to the other side of the two-way mirror to Syd re: tea
N: Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the cup to her lips.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: I know you think -- look at me. Hey. Edith.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: I know you think Irv loves you. I know you think you know him -- that he sees the world as a cold, dark place, and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list: his son, his father, Rosalyn, and you. And you think you're at the top of that list. But what if you're not. What if you're not even on the list at all? He'd be in here right now if he took the check.
E: CONT'D
N: She thinks about this. She trembles.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: He'd be in here right now if he took the check. But no, you did. God, it's, it's so clear to me. It's so crazy -- it's clear to me, but it's not clear to you. He uses you, Edith, to protect himself. To protect his son and his wife in Long Island. No? Yes. He put a ring on her finger, he adopted her son. They have huge house, they have two cars. What does she do all day? I'll tell you what she does -- she plays with her nails, she watches T.V., and she spends your money, the money that you make.
E: CONT'D
N: Edith stares at Richie, taking this in.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: I don't like that you're in jail while he's going free. I don't like any of that. I want to help you. All the razzle-dazzle that he does, it's not good. It's not real. It's fake. It's not real. Who you are is who you are, between you and God. You and your soul. That's what matters. That's what counts. That's what I'm about. And that's what I see in you. Tell me you didn't feel it the first time we saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't think so. I'm not supposed to be talking like this, but I don't care, I break the rules.
E: CONT'D
N: Edith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what he's saying.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help you. I like you. I like you. I like you.
E: CONT'D whispers dead serious
S: INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY
N: Irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at Sydney. Richard Dimaso walks in.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Been in there three days. Hasn't been so good for her.
N: Irv continues to stare at Sydney.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: How does that make you feel her in there? That check was for you, right? But you knew somethin' was off. That's 'cause you're good. You're, like, the best at what you do in the whole country, aren't you?
E: CONT'D
N: Irv looks at him.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: But you know what? If the country were run by people like you, Irving Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern Europe or Guatemala. You ever been in Guatemala? You ever been in jail in Guatemala? You ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in Guatemala? That's what this country would be like if we let people, let the liars like you, run this country.
E: CONT'D
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Who made you god and judge?
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: My grandmother lived to be ninety- three years old. Never lied in her life.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Congratulations.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Thank you. I'm proud of that, too. Does that make her not a good person? Is that not something to strive for?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Why you breaking my balls? Get to the point.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: I see something in you, Irving. I get very excited. I think that we have a lot of potential here. Now, look. I came up with the idea. It's all from me. I want to change things. I want to go after white collar crime. Irving, you're very skilled. And I want you to teach me and we can do this. I want four people that do what you do. Fraudulent investments. Fake certificates of deposit. Stolen art, fake art. You get me four people and you're off the hook.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Four busts and you'll leave us alone? We don't have to testify?
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: You're good, you're done. Anything you want. But if you run, then your life is over. You'll be hunted, and it's gonna be very difficult for Rosalyn and your kid to live in this country.
S: INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A NICE UPPER EAST SIDE apartment. Sydney has finally changed her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding cell. It is quiet in the apartment - faint street noise from 3rd Avenue below.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: We need to leave. We need to run and we need to do it now. We can go to Estonia or Romania, I don't care, we'll take the cash from the bed and get out of here, alright? We talked about it a hundred times.
N: Irv stares at her and struggles.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What about Danny?
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: What about Danny?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I adopted him! I gave him my name! I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn, she's unstable!
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: That's a manipulation! Rosalyn's will never let you go. She'll use Danny against you because she's too messed up to let you leave.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I can't leave him. I love him. Alright? He's my son.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Richie said you would say that.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Richie? What, the cop? Your on a first name basis with him?
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Yes I am. I'm not even on your list am I?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What list?
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Your list. Your short list. Your long list. I'm not even on anyone of your fucking lists. I thought you loved me. I thought we had something.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: We do have something. I love you, it's perfect! What are you saying? We're gonna go to Romania? We're gonna take Danny?
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Yes. Yes, that's what I'm saying. You, me, Danny.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Well you never said that before.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: I'm saying it now. We're us, and we can make it an adventure like we did. We can make it an adventure like we make everything, alright? But we have to go now. We have to leave right now.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I can't leave Danny. I'll lose custody.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: You have to take me away! We have to leave!
N: (sobbing) What are you saying?! Oh my god.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What are you doing?! Please!
N: Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her apartment. Irving follows.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: I can't believe this is happening.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Don't say I don't love you because that's bullshit!
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: This is bullshit. You are bullshit. We are bullshit.
E: sobbing
N: She starts sobbing, shaking.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Please don't do this.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: I just never thought you were conning me.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I could never con you. I love you. Please don't say this.
N: Irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as she sobs.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: No, I'm done.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Don't say that.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: I'm gonna do these four busts, these four cons, to get us out of this. Not just me, but us. And I'm gonna get really close with Richie, the cop, in case we need to use him, if we need another move.
E: cries
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: We don't need another move. We need four busts, and we're done.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: We are going to need another move, trust me. And you're going to be thanking me. The key to people is what they believe and what they want to believe and I want to believe that we were real, and I want to believe that a man could want me. And I'm gonna take all of that heartbreak, and all of that sorrow, and I am going to use it. And I'm going to make Richie think that I want him, and that I like him, and I'm going to be very convincing -- And I'm pissed at you.
E: shifts to British accent
N: Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Because I'm pissed at you!
E: CONT'D
N: Irving stares at Sydney with confusion. He's never seen her like this before.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Maybe I do like him -- Maybe I like him a lot. From the feet up right -- baby?
E: CONT'D
N: Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Quite your belly aching and come up with something to get us out of this. And you're right -- I'm in no state to deal with this so what's it gonna be, Mister Mastermind?
E: CONT'D
N: SOUND PRELAP:
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: An Arab sheik? Why do we need an Arab Sheik?
E: O.S.
S: INT. ART MUSEUM - DAY
N: Richie, in sharp lapeled suit, chain on his neck, walks with Irv and Edith and joined by a man who looks like an ARAB SHEIK who they trail.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: How do you think this works, stupid?
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: If you could not call him `stupid' which he's isn't, he's smarter than you. Last I checked he's in control here and we work for him now so be nice.
N: Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him. He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him in.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: OK, to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees. In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing. Then those guys will want to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy, take the sheik's money, see?
E: stares at her, upset
N: Richie looks at Irving uncertain.
C: SYDNEY PROSSER
D: Only they can't get into his money unless you they know someone, and that someone is us.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Oh that's good.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: So if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend -- Carl Elway -- you get him to want to buy-
E: CONT'D
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Keep your voice down.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: -- or sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit, he needs -- who does he need? -- he needs a rich sheik guy, and there you go -- we can pinch him!
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Right, but I don't tell Elway shit. I wait for him to call me. The art world is a small world -- and one of Elway's acquaintances is clocking us right now.
N: Richie starts to look around.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Where?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Don't look.
N: Richie looks anyway and sees ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE, a man balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You have a good look?
E: CONT'D
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: How do you know the Sheik?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD

S: INT. ART MUSEUM - NEXT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

D: I want to show you something. This Rembrandt here? People come from all over the world to see this.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Yeah, he's good.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: It's a fake.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Wait, what're you talking about? That's impossible.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: People believe what they want to believe. Cause the guy who made this was so good that it's real to everybody. Now whose the master -- the painter or the forger?
N: Richie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: That's a fake?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: That's the way the world works. Not black and white as you say. Extremely grey.
N: ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and steps into the conversation.
C: ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE
D: Irving can I --
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: How many times I gotta tell you. You can't meet the sheik, alright?
N: Edith sees this and steps into the conversation.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met before.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: I wanted to introduce you to Robert Spencer. We're advising the Sheik together.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks at Richie. Richie offers his hand.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor to the sheik.
E: catching up
S: 70A EXT. CHELSEA HOTEL -- ESTABLISHING - DAY 70A INT. OFFICE OF CARL ELWAY - SUCCESSFUL, BUT SHADY - DAY
N: CARL ELWAY, 40, preppie Waspy, very old fashioned with cigarette holder, but something vaguely criminal about him, in his conservative suit, natty white and red striped shirt, and navy blue tie sits with Irving.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: What's this I hear about a god damn Sheik?! Why you leaving me out of this? I gotta hear about it from my friends?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: It ain't for you Carl.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: What do you mean it ain't for me? We gotta do certificates of deposit. I can print as many as you need.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: This is not a one man operation.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: Look, I can get other guys. What are you talking about Irving?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week?
N: The camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny microphone.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: Yes I can make that happen. Carl Elway can do what he says he's going to do.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: That's interesting but you know I've got other guys lined up. I've got a meeting with my associates.
N: SUDDENLY CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT, OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS. Richie Dimaso and Edith ARE STANDING THERE -- MUCH TO IRV'S DISMAY.

D: I've got to go.
N: Irving gets up to walk out as Richie and Edith stand in the doorway.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Crazy thing about people -- the more you say no, the more they want in on somethin. It is so stupid.
E: V.O.
N: Irving looks over at Richie and Edith.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey you know what Carl just told me? He said he could do this whole thing with four guys within a week.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: Or we could do somethin' much bigger!
N: Richie jumps into the conversation.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Something bigger? My guy deals with hundreds of millions of dollars. How much bigger?
N: He walks over to Carl.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: Hundreds of million -- I knew you were holdin' out on me Irving! Hundreds of millions of dollars? Like much bigger. Like I'm talking about we say never the fuck mind the CD's and we could have some complete access to something huge.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Huge? Like what? Robert Spencer, advisor to the Sheik.
E: introducing himself
C: CARL ELWAY
D: Carl Elway.
N: Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith, DRESSED TO THE NINES.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: I want you to think of the most undervalued asset in the state of New Jersey today. The rebuilding of Atlantic City.
E: CONT'D
N: Richie looks over at Irving and Sydney and mouths the word "WOW".
C: CARL ELWAY
D: Look, maybe they, maybe they legalized gambling a year ago but nothing's happening.
E: CONT'D
N: Irving interjects.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Hey, quit while you're ahead Carl.
C: CARL ELWAY
D: I know the guy. I know the right people who are going to help you out.

S: INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY
N: PUSH IN: STODDARD THORSEN, Richie's FBI supervisor.
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: Carmine Polito? Carmine Polito, no.
E: shakes his finger `no'
N: We freeze frame on Stoddard as we HEAR Richie'S VO: AS Richie TALKS WE SEE A SHORT FILM ABOUT Carmine Polito: - PUSH IN: Mayor Polito walks a Camden street waves, shakes hands of WELL-WISHERS
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell me that Carmine Polito was the most quietly powerful person in the state of New Jersey. A lifetime native of the very racially mixed Camden, which had become a ghetto, and where he had been Mayor for ten years. A very beloved guy. A guy who never gave up on his people. His father had emigrated from Italy and had stoked coal.
E: V.O.
N: - Frank Sinatras COFFEE SONG, 1940s version, as we see Carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at breakfast.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: A big family guy with five kids. They even adopted some other kid. A black kid from the Boys and Girls Club who'd lost his family. I mean, his household was a joyous place. And his wife Dolly, she was the apple of his eye and the center of the household. I mean everyone loved this guy.
E: V.O.
N: - PULL OUT Mayor Polito walks up steps of City Hall as he greets a women and her baby; into his office greeted by a couple of AIDES who show him papers to sign.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: And he had a huge heart.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CAMDEN CITY HALL - W.P.A. MURAL ROOM - DAY
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to paint this during the Depression. Why can't we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding Atlantic City?
E: giving speech
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: He worked with all the unions. He was the leader of the State Assembly. And he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs.
E: V.O.
N: -- FLOOR OF STATE ASSEMBLY -- Carmine huddles with other STATE LEGISLATORS, horsetrading and then poses for a picture with other members of the State Assembly.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: But he couldn't get the funds to rebuild Atlantic City and that was his problem. So with our help, he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time. And to me that meant corrupt
E: V.O.
N: BACK TO:
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: You said grifters and con artists. We're not going after some politician. This is a bad idea, Richard.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Shhhh. Look, it's really simple. All you need is to put two million in a Chase account --
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: What?!
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: -- under the Sheik's name --
E: CONT'D
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: Whose two million?!
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Shh, just listen. Two million dollars under the Sheik's name, in a Chase account that we control. Carmine calls up on the telephone -- calls the bank -- and he sees that the Sheik is real and he has a real account. Five days.
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: I'm not taking two million dollars of the taxpayers' money and putting it anywhere for five days, I don't care if we control it the whole time.
N: Richie as he stares at Stoddard in frustration.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country. That's my dream. Don't smother it, please.
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: You know Richard, I understand your eagerness. I really do. You know I'm from Michigan, right? Let me tell you a story about me, and my dad, and my brother. We used to go ice fishing every November. Ice Fishing. That's what we lived for.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Holy shit --
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: Just listen to me. It's beautiful. You have a little stove. You huddle around, you keep each other warm. You drop a line and you just wait. One year my brother says, "let's go in October." He wants to go ice fishing in October. My dad says, "No, the ice is too thin." My brother says -- I love my brother he says --
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: I understand what's happening. You're saying your brother went out on the ice, the ice was too thin, he fell through the ice, he went in the water because he was too eager, and you're saying I'm too eager -- that's what you're saying?
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: No, that's not what I'm saying.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: What are you saying?
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: We'll finish the ice fishing story another time, young man. For now, no Carmine Polito. Go do your job.
N: Richie looks at him annoyed and upset.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Stoddard shot the whole thing down.
E: V.O.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Boring.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: But Edith was a genius.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: SEE B-ROLL OF: Edith and Richie walk back into FBI building, down corridor;
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: She somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room. A woman I'd never heard of. Way back in a warren buried in the Bureau. This cat lady nobody even talked to. Edith met her in the ladies room and became friends with her. This lady handled all the wires and now, she was working with us.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: SMASH TO: Edith and Richie enter to find BRENDA, FBI, MATRONLY, OLDER; EDITH carries a basket of exotic teas;
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: She was excited to be included in an operation instead of being on the other end of a memo. It was beautiful.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Edith goes to hand her the PIMMS CUP and basket of teas.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Brenda, hi!
C: BRENDA MCPHERSON
D: Hi!
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You said you liked exotic food, so that's from England.
C: BRENDA MCPHERSON
D: That's from England?
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: That's right. And I brought you some tea as well.
C: BRENDA MCPHERSON
D: Thank you so much! Nobody ever tells me about these operations, they just say, "Brenda, do the clerical wiring work and don't ask questions."
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You need to tell Richie about your cats. He loves them.
C: BRENDA MCPHERSON
D: Oh my cats?!
N: Brenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork.
C: BRENDA MCPHERSON
D: Well that's Harry -- look at him standing up, isn't that sweet? And that's Wendy. She's a rascal. But Barnaby, that's another story. Barnaby plays the piano!
E: CONT'D
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: That's impressive.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: We got her to wire two million dollars into an F.B.I.-controlled account at Chase. It'd be there for five days and if Polito called he'd see that the Sheik was real.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: HALLWAY OF FBI Edith and Richie laugh excitedly as they walk the hallways.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: By the time Stoddard caught up to us Edith made sure his boss was impressed by my idea. So before he even knew it was happening his boss was calling to congratulate him.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: PUSH IN ON CHIEF US PROSECUTOR, SPECIAL TASK FORCE, ANTHONY AMADO IN HIS LARGE OFFICE ON THE PHONE WITH STODDARD --
C: ANTHONY AMADO
D: I'm very impressed. That was very smart. The Sheik with the money in the bank is a fantastic...don't be modest.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Anthony Amado. He was the U.S. Attorney, and he had a major hard- on to make a name for himself. I mean this guy loved the idea of being famous. And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he'd look stupid in front of his boss.
E: V.O.
S: INT. STODDARD'S OFFICE --
N: PUSH IN ON STODDARD -- confused, dismayed.
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik --
S: INT. STODDARD'S OFFICE - DAY
N: He hangs up, pissed, confused.
C: STODDARD THORSEN
D: You made me accept praise from my boss who's thanking me for something that never shoulda happened! Something that I didn't approve!
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: You should be happy. There's imaginative things happening in this office, alright? We're not just working in a box.
N: Richie leaves triumphant.

S: INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: We succeeded because we stayed small. I got you Carl Elway. He bought stolen art, sold fake bank C.D.'s, that's enough. That's one. I get you three more -- no politicians.
N: Richie and Edith look at him.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: You're gonna do this because you got no choice. You work for me.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Now you keep changing the rules. You're gettin' a little power drunk, Richard.
E: MORE
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You want to tell him, Edith? You want to wake him up?
E: CONT'D
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Oh no, I said we shouldn't do any of it, Irving. You know I said that. So now I support Richie. He's got vision. Do it heavy or don't do it.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I mean, he's the one ruining America, not me.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: How the hell am I ruining America?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Because people just got over Watergate and Vietnam, alright? And you're gonna shit all over politicians again? And just because you want to be a big shot and get a promotion.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: No I'm thinking big. This is gonna be fantastic. We're doing video surveillance. I'm doing this from the feet up.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You will never do it properly because you got too much government attitude to be small and sleek. I'm like the fuckin' Vietcong, man. I'm in and I'm out. I was there the whole time -- you don't know it. That's the fucking art of becoming somebody who people can pin their beliefs and their dreams on. And you can't do it.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: How about a suite at the Sheraton Hotel?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: For Carmine Polito and rebuilding Atlantic City?
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Why not?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You need a luxury hotel for the Sheik. Come on!
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Carmine does back door dealings all the time. We don't have a budget for that Irving!
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You gotta knock the Mayor, the Speaker of the State Assembly -- you gotta knock him off of his fucking feet. He's gotta feel like he's out of his league. What you're offering, this deal, I mean, this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey, maybe even the whole fucking country. A sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City -- are you fuckin' kidding me? That's gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going to want to see cash, he's going to want to see it in an account, he's going to want to see it right now, and he will check. And that's why this meeting isn't happening, because to get millions, you need millions.
N: Edith listens intently.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: We already did it.
E: shrugs
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What?
E: stunned
N: Irv studies Richie and Edith.
C: EDITH GREENSLY

D: She showed me.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You showed him our thing? You did that without me? Are you kidding me?
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: What are you going to do?
N: IRVING AND RICHIE LOOK AT SYDNEY, UNCERTAIN. IRVING SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISGUST AND LEAVES. RICHIE STARES AT SYDNEY SWINGING HER LEGS ON THE COUNTER AS SHE SITS.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: You playing me? Are we doing this? Or you playing him? It'd be very bad for you if you're playing me.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You're going to have to decide for yourself, kid, I just laid everything out on the table.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: This is all very exciting, I never knew life could be like this. You're wild. You know we're taking down a very important politician.
N: Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she sits on the counter. He puts his hands on her hips, pulls her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face, makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back. They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
E: CONT'D prelap MORE

N: Carmine will not turn around -- Irving catches up.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Really, I'm all right, thank you. I'm okay.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: No. I'm fucking embarrassed to be associated with that guy at all. Can I just say somethin' to you, please? Don't lose this opportunity to fuckin' Florida -- all right? -- because of some bullshit from that punk advisor with his diploma who could never get into the school that we come from. Don't lose that opportunity.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Where you from?

D: Yeah, Tomaso's.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: The spicy clams.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Yes. They're always good.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Oh, they're to fucking die for, those clams. I haven't been there in a while. I like that place.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Carmine -- can I call you Carmine? You know, Carmine -- My fuckin' heart's going from running down the stairs -- I'm not used to running. There's a lotta green grass in that hotel room up there, alright? And all the deals would float through you. You get a serious piece on both ends. You do with that what you will. I live in the real world, I am a family man, I got mouths to feed and everything. But, you know, we just...we gotta grease you directly. No middlemen, no bullshit. It's the Arab way.
E: catches his breath
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Yeah, look, I understand. It's a great opportunity. It's just I got a little thrown by going to have a meeting with somebody who ended up not being there, so --
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Hey, listen, I was thrown as well.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: I understand. I'll deal with you directly. I don't want any middleman or any of that bullshit.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Done.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: I like you. Eye to eye. We can do business together.

C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Did you tell him you were working with me? That I'm the Sheik's associate?!
C: IRVING ROSENFELD

C: RICHIE DIMASO

C: STODDARD THORSEN

C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: It means you gotta be committed! It means you gotta be committed to something in your life, for Christ's sake. I want a jet at Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be a small jet. It doesn't even have to take off, cause I know you're so worried about how much money the Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It can take off and land on the tarmac, okay?

T: Richie cuts him off.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: So you tried to protect your brother, but you couldn't and that's why you feel bad, because you're trying to protect me and you're worried about me. Is that what the story's about? About protection?

C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I don't want another one. I want the one that Carmine gave me.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: "I want the one Carmine gave me!" Carmine, Carmine, why don't you just marry Carmine, get a little gold microwave and put it on a chain around your neck. You want to be more like Carmine? Why don't you build something like he does, instead of all your empty deals that are just like your fucking science oven. You know I read that it takes all of the nutrition out of our food. It's empty, just like your deals. Empty, empty!
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: That's bullshit.

C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What are you doing? Get under the umbrella. It's just that Carmine wants Rosalyn to come.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: I don't care. You weren't listening. I don't care if Rosalyn comes. Just do your job, okay? You're nothing to me until you're everything. I'm not Rosalyn. I'm not gonna put up with that shit.
N: THEY ARRIVE AT Richie as the JET arrives on the tarmac.

N: Off to the side, Richie steels himself with bump of cocaine before walking inside the old resort, his eyes dilate.
S: INT. LOBBY OF GRAND OLD SEASIDE HOTEL - NIGHT
N: The entourage walks through the ornate lobby as Edith and Rosalyn continue to eyeball each other with Irv uncomfortably in the middle as Carmine ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONTINUES HIS PRESENTATION FOR THE SHEIK.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: So this is the lobby. Now mind you, a week ago this place was a mess, but what existed was this plasterwork. Look at the detail. This is beautiful. My sons are craftsmen. Please, tell them what you did.
E: to son, Dominic
C: DOLLY POLITO
D: Tell them everything you know. The trompe l'oeil.
C: DOMINIC POLITO
D: Birds, sky, clouds, wood. Trompe l'oeil -- "Trick of the eye."
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: We can restore all of this, you see? You save 50 million -- look at me -- fifty million right off the bat -- I waive the law I helped write. It said casino construction must be ground up new, we don't do new. We renovate.
C: DOLLY POLITO
D: We don't do new. We renovate.

AS Irv IS PULLED ASIDE CONFIDENTIALLY BY Carmine -- Richie AND Edith WATCH -- Rosalyn STANDS TO THE SIDE -- Carmine puts his arm around Irv's shoulders --
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: There are some gentlemen over there at the bar. That's a hundred and thirty years sitting there -- that's how much time's between them. They run the biggest casinos in the United States. We have to work with them.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Right.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: The good news is they know how it's done. They get it done. You don't have to worry. Everyone makes their money.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You mean the Mob?
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Yes, but they're businessmen, okay? Now, spend as much or as little time with them as you like, but we do have to deal with them. All we've got to do is go say hello. We just gotta say hi, that's all.
N: Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND ADRENALINE --
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We gotta confer before we talk to these guys.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Confer? What is there to confer about? They're casino guys.
E: interrupting, hopped up
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: They are businessmen.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: We came all this way, Irving. We should be here. What's everybody scared of? There's nothing to be scared of.
N: Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks increasingly uncomfortable.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Those are the guys you're all scared of? Those guys over there? They don't scare me.
E: re: the mob guys
N: She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Rosalyn!
N: But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine watch.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: I love this!
N: Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Hi. Can I sit here?
N: Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the Mafia guys.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Irving, this is not a good idea.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: How you guys doing? Everybody over there is really scared of you guys, you know that?
N: She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved. Dolly ushers her kids to the door.
C: DOLLY POLITO
D: Kids, I want you to go up and get some pizza and soda, please.
N: Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: It's a disaster.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I think they have this room all wrong.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: Yeah? What would you do?
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I would do it in all black and gold and I would do this bar like a big, warm golden mirror.
C: DICK HELSING
D: Sounds beautiful.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Thank you.
N: Rosalyn's smitten by the mobsters.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: But you expect that from her because she's so beautiful --
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Oh stop.
C: DICK HELSING
D: Gorgeous.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: I love her hair, so I know I'm gonna love how she'd do the room --
N: He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs. Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: How do you do?
C: PETE MUSANE
D: I'm sorry is she your wife?
E: to Richie
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: No, she's my wife. She's my wife.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Look at these fine gentleman.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: Carmine, there you are.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: How you doing?
N: Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and puts it on table.
C: PETE MUSANE AND GUYS
D: Ohhhh, heyyyyy! Come onnn!
C: ROSALYN
D: It's because he's a party pooper. He's so boring.
N: Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in his hand. He knows how to fake it.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: You have a very beautiful wife.
N: DICK HELSING, ROSALYN ROSENFELD, OTHER
C: GUYS
D: Salud.
N: THE MADE GUYS LAUGH. SYD ROLLS HER EYES. IRVING, CARMINE STARE WITH TENSION. THEY ALL LAUGH. RICHIE GUIDES SHEIK with ONE BODY GUARD.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: May I present Sheik Abdullah, gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi. Sheik, these men are professionals, they run the best casinos in the United States.
N: The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely uncomfortable.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our seriousness, Mr. Tallegio came from Miami to meet you tonight.
N: HEAVY PAUSE.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Mr. Tallegio? Why didn't you tell me Mr. Tallegio was here?
C: PETE MUSANE
D: He's in the back room.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: It's a sign of disrespect to do business on the first meeting.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: That's not true. I don't know what your talking about. He's got it all wrong.
E: to Musane
C: DICK HELSING
D: Well, don't leave him back there in the back room waiting. Come on, let's go.
N: Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Hey Irving, I'm going to be having fun. Maybe it will be contagious.
N: Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with Carmine, Richie, and the Sheik. Sydney, worried about Rosalyn with Musane, decides to hang back.
S: INT. CASINO BACK ROOM -- NIGHT
N: SLOW PUSH IN ON POWERFUL LOOKING: BALD MAN IN SUNGLASSES, LIGHT GRAY SUIT, DARK TIE -- STANDING BY HIMSELF. CARMINE, RICHIE, SHEIK, IRVING ENTER A HALF FINISHED BACK ROOM. PUSH IN ON IRVING.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Carmine!
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man. In his prior reputation as an enforcer from twenty years ago, he was known to never bury a body because he felt it sent a stronger message to leave it in the street.
E: V.O.
N: FLASH BACK TO:
S: 125A EXT. STREET - NIGHT 125A
N: YOUNGER TELLEGIO WALKS LAUGHING WITH A COLLEAGUE, LETS COLLEAGUE GET AHEAD AND TELLEGIO SUDDENLY PULLS PISTOL, FIRES THREE BULLETS WITH MUZZLE FLASH INTO MAN'S HEAD, MAN GOES TO GROUND, TELLEGIO FIRES ONCE MORE, DROPS CLIP FROM GUN AND SPITS ON BODY, WALKS DIRECTLY TO CAMERA MENACING. NOW BACK TO:
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: This is the guy we now had to deal with.
E: V.O.
S: 125B INT. CASINO BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS 125B
N: RESUME PUSH IN ON TELLEGIO AS A COUPLE OF BUSBOYS SET UP AN IMPROMPTU TABLE AND CHAIRS. Carmine greets him.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: You sure you don't want to go into the Ocean Bar? It's really, it's beautiful in there.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: I'm very happy I don't have to go there. I like it here. There's an exit. I'm like a ghost. Nobody knows I'm here.
N: Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table. Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to Richie.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Tell him I speak for our friends in Florida. We're very excited. It's been our lifelong dream to build casino resorts on the East Coast.
E: CONT'D
N: Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: You told him that? They didn't want the Jews to make money, they didn't want the Italians to make money, definitely don't want the blacks to make money. After the oil embargo -- the gasoline crisis -- the hijackings, the Olympics, they don't want to see Arabs make money, trust me, not on our soil. You can tell him this in your own way: I've been in the casino business forty years. It's scrutinized more carefully than any other business. Carmine made this legal, but we must be careful or they'll take it away.
E: CONT'D
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: So, Mister Tellegio, how do you think we should approach this? What do you want to do?
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: If you want to get the gaming license and keep it we have to make our principal investor here, the Sheik, an American citizen.
N: Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure where this is going.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: To expedite citizenship -- well, that requires very special treatment.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: You would know the right people to do that, Carmine.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Carmine knows everybody.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What are we talking about?
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: U.S. Senators. Congressmen.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Wow, that's fantastic.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I say stay away from that. That's bad. That's trouble. No, that's not good.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Irving please.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: That's trouble.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Who is this guy? What are you, a farmer?
E: to Irving
N: Richie and Tellegio both laugh.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is Irving. New York businessman. Irving Rosenfeld.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Irving, Irving. What's the matter, Irving? What's the problem?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: Nothing. No problem.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Don't get your balls in an uproar. Everything's fine, everything's good. It's all good. It's all good. I just hope the other part of this is all good. And real. Because we're real. You know that. You deal with us. We're a real organization. We deal with you, we don't know what we're dealing with.
N: Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence. This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to Richie and points to the Sheik. Irving watches in horror as --
C: VICTOR TALLEGIO
D: Where's he from?
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Abu Dhabi.
E: winging it
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Oh, he's from the Emirates.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Yeah.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: 
E: in subtitled Arabic Can I count on you? You gotta be honest about this. Do you understand me? Good means good. No bullshit.
N: PUSH IN ON IRV AND CARMINE FEELING THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: 
E: CONT'D to Sheik Did you hear what I said? Do you want me to repeat it?
N: Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: 
E: CONT'D What do you think now? Tell me. Tell me.
C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Uh, I think, I think what he's --
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: No, let him speak for himself.
N: Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense moment for everyone at the table. Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie share a look -- what is he doing? A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: No, I know him.
C: AL KOWALSKI
D: You guys are way too serious for a party! Hey, what are you drinking? You got a drink?
E: to Tellegio
N: TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION.
C: CARMINE
D: We're in a very serious meeting. I apologize.
E: to Al to Tellegio
N: TELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED.
C: AL KALOWSKI
D: I understand, you're in conference. You gotta come with me now. You got a speech to give. Everyone's waiting for you.
C: CARMINE POLITO
D: Al, I'll be right behind you, okay? Trust me.
N: Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
C: SHEIK ABDULLAH
D: It is great doing business with you. The investment is real. It was a pleasure to meet you.
E: In Arabic
N: Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything passable in Arabic.
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: What are the odds of an Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic? But it turns out he's got casino investments in the Mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand.
E: V.O.
N: Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Listen to me carefully. If you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks.
N: Carmine nods.
C: VICTOR TELLEGIO
D: Carmine, listen to me carefully, if you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks or not only will the Sheik feel insulted, but our friends in Florida will feel deeply disrespected and so will I.
E: CONT'D
N: Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad. AT THE BAR -- "WHITE RABBIT" CONTINUES. ROSALYN CONTINUES TO FLIRT WITH PETE MUSANE -- SYDNEY WATCHES OUT OF CONTROL ROSALYN, STANDS AND WALKS OVER TO HER.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Rosalyn, you need to come with me alright?
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I don't need to come with you.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You need to come with me. This needs to stop. Come on.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Oh, you think I should come with you?
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Yeah, you need to come with me right now.
N: Rosalyn takes her wrist out of Sydney's grasp.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Why don't you get your fucking hands off me, you fucking whore!
C: PETE MUSANE
D: Hey!
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: You're a whore. This is my husband's whore!
E: to everyone

D: That's real nice.
C: DOLLY POLITO
D: We're not going to do this in the Ocean Room tonight. Not tonight. Please.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: This is my husbands whore!
N: Dolly escorts Edith over to one side of the room away from Rosalyn.
C: DOLLY POLITO
D: You stay over here with me. Everybody just calm down. I don't know what's going on.
N: Pete looks over to Rosalyn.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: You alright? Take it easy. These things happen. Whatever's meant to be will be.
N: Rosalyn smiles at Pete.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: That's what I always say.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: You say that?
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Yeah.
C: PETE MUSANE
D: See? Kindred spirits.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Whatever's meant to be will be.
C: PETE MUSANE

C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: He doesn't love you Rosalyn he loves me. And you know it and I know it and he knows it. And it might be done now, but it was beautiful and it was real.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Stop.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: And we loved each other.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Shut up.
N: Rosalyn starts to tear up.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You scare him, and you manipulate him, and you use your son!
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Well, he must like it on some level. He must want it because he keeps coming back for it. It's like that perfume that you love that you can't stop smelling, even when there's something sour in it. You can't get enough of it. But guess what, he's never gonna leave me. He's always going to want me, and I will make you so sorry, Edith. I will make you so sorry for what you've done to my family, mark my words.
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: That is fucked up! I would never say anything that fucked up to anybody, but you do because you're gross inside, you're so fucked up and gross.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Oh, I'm gross inside?
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: Yeah.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: Maybe you're gross inside, with robbing people and all that shit that you do? Maybe we're both gross inside, that's what Irving loves about us. At least he's consistent with his women. You know, sometimes in life all you have are fucked up, poisonous choices.
N: Rosalyn reaches over, grabs Sydney's face and kisses her. Rosalyn laughs a toxic, tough front dark laugh and walks out. THE BEE GEES "HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART?" STARTS. Sydney looks into the mirror and wipes the lipstick off her lips as Rosalyn storms out of the powder room.

And you curl your hair in little fucking curlers, which is -- No, it's okay, you look good with it, but you know -- you have straight hair, so that's what you do to survive.

N: Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now. Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a book.

C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I'm going to keep my mouth shut and I'm not going to say anything but what do I do if Pete calls me? What am I supposed to say?
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: You gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your I.R.S. and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that. You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that.
C: ROSALYN ROSENFELD
D: I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but you know that in real life, I was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that made you come up with this plan. So I will tell Pete.

C: RICHIE DIMASO
D: Where is Mr. Tellegio?
C: ALFONSE SIMONE
D: Mr. Tellegio unfortunately was called out of town on business.
C: RICHIE DIMASO

C: ALFONSE SIMONE
D: I can assure you that I have the power of attorney --
C: RICHIE DIMASO

D: We can't, we can't make that decision. It's not the right thing. It's not the right time. It's just not good.
E: to Simone
C: EDITH GREENSLY
D: You don't have the authorization to make this kind of choice so don't be hasty, alright?
E: to Irving across Richie
C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: I'm not being hasty. It's just, let's be smart about it. This is not how we do business. I'm sorry. I apologize.

C: IRVING ROSENFELD
D: That's not the plan. That's not the --

E: to Simone
C: ALFONSE SIMONE

N: IRVING STARES AND SYDNEY LOOKS AT RICHIE.
