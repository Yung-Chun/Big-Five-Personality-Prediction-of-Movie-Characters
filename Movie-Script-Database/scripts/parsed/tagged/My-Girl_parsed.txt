C: MR. BIXLER
D: The great way, is not difficult for those with no preferences, with the absence of both love and hate, everything becomes clear and undisguised. That was written by a Chinese Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I choose to bring that up in a creative writing class? Because, the absence of judgment helps us to appreciate reality. In other words, I want you to listen to your classmates writing, with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's gonna go first?
C: GUY
D: I got one.
N: He gets up I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a picture for you to see, I picked a rose for you to smell, I planted grass for you to touch, But you did not hear my song, You did not see my picture, You did not smell my rose and YOU did not touch my grass. Woman Maybe she was outta town?

N: The class applauds Okay ahh, who's next?
C: RONDA
D: I experienced something with my boyfriend the other day, and I wrote a few words down.
C: MR. BIXLER
D: The floor's yours Ronda.
C: RONDA
D: He covers me like a blanket, from the cold, dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in Lighter joint.
N: Several looks glance around the room. Vada raises her hand
C: MR. BIXLER
D: Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
C: VADA
D: I wrote a poem too.
C: MR. BIXLER
D: Please.
C: VADA
D: Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
N: That's all I got so far.
C: JUSTIN
D: I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky Road, it's about desire.
C: MR. BIXLER
D: Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes and that's also good but, you're not expressing to me what's in your soul. I want you to show me how you see the world, your fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.
C: VADA'S THOUGHTS
D: My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my mother.
N: OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, THEN INSIDE ON SHELLY AT DESK, TUBA IS BEING PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and proceeds to the living room Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a tune to Grammoo on his tuba
C: HARRY
D: Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
E: sung, to Grammoo
C: SHELLY
D: Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
C: HARRY
D: Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
C: SHELLY
D: I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
C: HARRY
D: After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
C: SHELLY
D: I'm sure she will.
N: VADA AND THOMAS J AT THEIR FAVORITE SPOT, EDGE OF LAKE WITH VERY LARGE BEAUTIFUL WEEPING WILLOW JUST UP THE BANK A LITTLE FROM A SMALL PIER WHERE TWO FISHING POLES ARE SET UP, ONE HELD BY VADA AND THE OTHER BY A HOLDER AS THOMAS J HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE TREE

C: VADA
D: Reel it in. He's only tiny, throw him back.
E: Thomas J reels the fish in
C: THOMAS J
D: I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
N: Thomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls
C: VADA
D: You're hurting him, don't kill him!!
N: The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor error in film} and in the process pricks herself
C: VADA
D: Ouch! Darn hook!
N: Vada puts the fish back
C: VADA
D: I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look.
N: Thomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of the water
C: THOMAS J
D: Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
C: VADA
D: Hey, we can become blood brothers.
C: THOMAS J
D: Naah, I don't wanna.
C: VADA
D: You could pick that scab on your arm.
C: THOMAS J
D: It's a mosquito bite.
C: VADA
D: It'll bleed.
C: THOMAS J
D: If I do it, can we go?
C: VADA

C: HARRY
D: I prefer it to "instead", it has more dignity.
C: SHELLY
D: In lieu... "instead".... No contest.
C: HARRY
D: It's no big deal.
C: SHELLY
D: You have to learn how to take a complement. Movies, movies, ahhhh, "Love Story" at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
E: Shelly turns the newspaper over
C: HARRY
D: I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
C: SHELLY
D: I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in. I'll let you get back to work.
E: subtle HINT
N: Shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face
C: HARRY
D: I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.

N: Harry resumes typing VADA IS RUNNING THROUGH FOYER AND BEGINS TO PASS BATHROOM WHERE SHELLY IS PUTTING ON MAKEUP
C: SHELLY
D: Hi Vada.
C: VADA
D: Are you going out somewhere?
C: SHELLY
D: No.
C: VADA
D: So how come you're putting lipstick on?
C: SHELLY
D: A girl's always gotta look her best.
C: VADA
D: I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
C: SHELLY
D: Have you ever tried any?
C: VADA
D: No.
C: SHELLY
D: Come here, sit down.
N: Vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of Vada. Vada gets some lipstick put on her
C: SHELLY
D: Now, first we blot.
N: Vada blots her lips on some tissue
C: SHELLY
D: Take a look. I think it looks real nice on you.
N: Vada looks in Shelly's mirror
C: VADA
D: Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
C: SHELLY
D: Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
C: VADA
D: The boys at school don't think I am.
C: SHELLY
D: They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
C: VADA
D: Do you like putting makeup on people?
C: SHELLY
D: Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet. All right, open your eyes.
E: she finishes her work
N: Vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror
C: VADA
D: Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that Hollywood thing.
N: VADA EXITS HOUSE THROUGH FRONT DOOR, RAUNCHY MUSIC IS PLAYING AND SHE DOES A GROOVY WALK TO THE STEPS WHERE THOMAS J AWAITS HER, SHE LIES DOWN LENGTH WAYS ACROSS THE STEP AND LOOKS AT HIM
C: THOMAS J
D: Your lip bleeding?
C: VADA
D: No.
C: THOMAS J
D: What's wrong with your eyes?
C: VADA
D: A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
C: THOMAS J
D: Where's your bike?
C: VADA
D: Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
N: The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is parked
C: VADA
D: It's only a garage, come on.
N: Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone
C: VADA
D: Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably fell off in here.
N: Thomas J walks over to a model of a head
C: THOMAS J
D: Hey look at this!
C: VADA
D: That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
C: THOMAS J
D: No, I don't wanna.
C: VADA
D: Come on, it's fun.
N: Vada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the chart
C: VADA
D: Hmmmm, interesting.
C: THOMAS J
D: What?
C: VADA
D: You have no personality.
C: THOMAS J
D: Hey, where does it say that?
C: VADA
D: Never mind.
N: Thomas J knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo
C: THOMAS J
D: Is that your Dad?
C: VADA
D: Yes.
C: THOMAS J
D: Who's that with your Dad?
C: VADA
D: It's my mother.
C: THOMAS J
D: Do you remember her?
C: VADA
D: No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
C: THOMAS J
D: What do you think it's like?
C: VADA
D: What?
C: THOMAS J
D: Heaven.
C: VADA
D: I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
C: THOMAS J
D: But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
C: VADA
D: It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
C: THOMAS J
D: That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
N: As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then returns to Thomas J HARRY'S BEDROOM, HARRY IS DRESSING AND GETTING READY FOR HIS DATE WITH SHELLY The tune "Moonglow" is playing on the radio
C: PHIL
D: Well well well, what's going on in here?

C: PHIL
D: Oh yes, oh that's great.
C: HARRY

C: PHIL
D: Why?
C: HARRY
D: The last date I had was twenty years ago.
C: PHIL
D: That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, "The Sexual Revolution", now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
C: HARRY
D: Oh come on.
C: PHIL
D: Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Are you sure about all this?
C: PHIL
D: Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
C: HARRY
D: Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
C: PHIL
D: Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
C: HARRY
D: No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
C: PHIL
D: Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
N: Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way
C: HARRY
D: Goodnight Vada.
C: VADA
D: Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
C: HARRY
D: Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
C: VADA
D: You never cared before.
C: HARRY
D: Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
C: VADA
D: Why?
C: HARRY
D: She likes to play bingo.
C: VADA
D: Can I go too?
C: HARRY
D: Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
N: Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out the door OUTSIDE THE SENNET'S HOUSE, VADA IS CREEPING ALONG NIGHT Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does
C: THOMAS J
D: Vada? Vada?? Where are you??
N: Vada springs up from her hiding place
C: VADA
D: Here.
C: THOMAS J
D: Don't DO that!!
C: VADA
D: Sorry.
C: THOMAS J
D: What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
C: VADA
D: Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
C: THOMAS J
D: I told you i'll get in trouble.
C: VADA
D: Pacifist!
C: THOMAS J
D: I am not.
C: VADA
D: Bed wetter!
C: THOMAS J
D: I stopped that!
N: AT THE CHURCH, FOCUS ON THE BINGO ANNOUNCER WHO IS CALLING OUT THE NUMBERS
C: HARRY
D: Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For instance, on a given night anybody can win, but I play the odds, when choosing bingo cards, I use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. This way you get much more activity.
C: SHELLY
D: Does it make it easier to win?
E: hopeful
C: HARRY
D: No. Just, more activity.
N: Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting Shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down
C: HARRY
D: Hi Carl.
E: as he sits down, to the person next to him
N: OUTSIDE THE CHURCH NIGHT Vada and Thomas J are walking up to the church
C: THOMAS J
D: They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
C: VADA
D: We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
C: THOMAS J
D: Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
C: VADA
D: Duck!
N: Vada and Thomas J are ducking behind a counter on one side of the church, Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on the other side of the room
C: SHELLY
D: Oh great!
E: in the distance, as a number is announced
C: THOMAS J
D: Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
C: VADA
D: Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
C: SHELLY
D: Aarrggh.
E: in the distance again, as another number is announced
N: CLOSE UP OF HARRY AND SHELLY As Shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big way
C: SHELLY
D: I just had a terrible thought Harry.
C: HARRY
D: What's that?
C: SHELLY
D: I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
C: HARRY
D: Why d'you think these seats were empty.
N: OUTSIDE
C: THOMAS J
D: Can we go yet?
C: VADA
D: Go???
C: THOMAS J
D: You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
N: CLOSE UP AGAIN
C: SHELLY
D: Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
C: SHELLY
D: Kinda like men.
C: HARRY
D: Oh, how do you mean?
C: SHELLY
D: You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
N: Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other, Vada sees this and doesn't look too happy about it
C: VADA
D: BINGO!
E: in semi-deep fake voice
C: BINGO ANNOUNCER
D: We have a winner. Will the winner please raise their hand?
C: CARL
D: There was no bingo, it came from outside.
C: VERNON
D: How could someone outside get a bingo?
C: CARL
D: Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone outside yelled bingo you moron!
C: VERNON
D: Who are you calling a mowon?
E: false teeth
C: VERNON'S WIFE
D: Put a lid on it Vernon!
C: CARL
D: Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!
N: The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break it up
C: HARRY
D: Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.
N: Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing OUTSIDE
C: VADA
D: We can go now.
N: Vada and Thomas J run off down the street VADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her window and looks out it through the venetian blinds OUTSIDE STOPPED CAR Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, eventually
C: SHELLY
D: I had a good time tonight.
C: HARRY
D: I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
N: They walk up to Shelly's camper
C: SHELLY
D: Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
C: HARRY
D: Okay, sure.
N: They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room INSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER
C: SHELLY
D: Home sweet home.
C: HARRY
D: It's nice.
C: SHELLY
D: I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
C: HARRY
D: Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
C: SHELLY
D: You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
N: Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the bathroom, and then flushes the toilet
C: HARRY
D: Yeah.
C: SHELLY
D: Are you mad at me?
C: HARRY
D: No, why?
C: SHELLY
D: I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
C: HARRY
D: Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
C: SHELLY
D: What happened to her?
C: HARRY
D: Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
C: SHELLY
D: Did she ever see Vada?
C: HARRY
D: I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
N: Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling with to calm his nerves Did I ruin this?
C: SHELLY
D: Dance with me?
C: HARRY
D: Here?
C: SHELLY
D: This is where we are.
C: HARRY
D: Is there enough room?
N: Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more room
C: HARRY
D: I haven't danced in.....
C: SHELLY
D: In ages, I know, me neither.
N: They begin a slow dance
C: HARRY
D: Rock?
C: SHELLY
D: See, you're not that out of touch. You're good.
E: they dance
C: HARRY
D: At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
N: Shelly smells Harry's neck
C: SHELLY
D: What are you wearing?
C: HARRY
D: Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
N: They continue to dance
C: SHELLY
D: Do you want to?
C: HARRY
D: Want to what?
C: SHELLY
D: Kiss me.
C: HARRY
D: Yes.
C: SHELLY
D: Good.
N: They then have a long kiss
C: SHELLY
D: Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very optimistic.
N: They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock cuckooing
C: HARRY
D: I ahh, better go.
C: SHELLY
D: It's only eight o'clock.
C: HARRY
D: Goodnight Shelly.
C: SHELLY
D: Goodnight.
N: Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the door OUTSIDE CAMPER NIGHT, HARRY HAS JUST GOT OUT OF SHELLY'S CAMPER
C: SHELLY
D: Well, I guess it's official we had a date, maybe we can play bingo again sometime.
C: HARRY
D: I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
C: SHELLY
D: Goodnight.
N: Harry waves VADA'S ROOM Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed SUMMER WRITING CLASS DAY
C: MR. BIXLER
D: Before the class started, Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation.
C: WOMAN
D: Ooooh that's really cool.
C: JUSTIN
D: Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes out into the group.
N: Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play weird music
C: RONDA
D: Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.
C: JUSTIN
D: Now, try to feel what the other person is feeling, without speaking any words, send out your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at the same time. Can you feel it?
C: RONDA
D: Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody feel?
C: GUY
D: I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.
C: OTHER GUY
D: I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, she's so cosmically in tune.
C: RONDA
D: So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, and I felt like, you were full of inner peace and harmony.
C: MR. BIXLER
D: Vada, what did you feel.
C: VADA
D: I felt Justin's hangnail.
C: JUSTIN
D: No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, feel my aura.
C: VADA
D: I don't think I'm allowed to.
C: JUSTIN
D: I tell you what, let's try it again, hold hands.
C: VADA'S THOUGHTS
D: Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. It got infected and traveled to her vocal chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.
N: VADA'S ROOM, VADA LYING ON BED THINKING Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual healing SUPERMARKET DAY, VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING
C: HARRY
D: Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce.
N: Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out
C: SHELLY
D: Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
C: VADA
D: Hi.
C: HARRY
D: I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
C: SHELLY
D: Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
C: HARRY
D: Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
C: SHELLY
D: It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
C: HARRY
D: I'm looking forward to that.
N: Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly, and she rams her cart into Harry
C: HARRY
D: HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
C: VADA
D: Sorry.
C: SHELLY
D: You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
C: HARRY
D: Really?
C: VADA
D: Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
E: picking up large can of prunes
C: HARRY
D: Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. I don't know what's gotten into her today.
E: to Shelly
N: Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not giving a stuff what they contain
C: VADA'S THOUGHTS
D: I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff.
N: CLOSE UP OF AMERICAN FLAG DAY, HARRY - PLAYING TUBA, SHELLY, PHIL & VADA SINGING "STAR SPANGLED BANNER" AND

C: PHIL
D: No, no no....
C: HARRY
D: Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
N: Phil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry
C: SHELLY
D: How's it going chef?
C: HARRY
D: Okay.
N: Vada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly, she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between Harry and Shelly
C: VADA
D: Are they ready yet?
C: HARRY
D: No, sweetie, not yet.
N: Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off
C: VADA
D: When?
C: HARRY
D: Soon honey, soon.
N: Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair (which there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with) And Vada shakes her off again
C: VADA
D: When??

E: laughing
N: Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing looking around
C: SHELLY
D: Oh shit! Excuse me...
E: under her breath
N: Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space
C: MAN
D: Hey Shelly, who lives here? The Addams Family?
E: pointing at hearse
C: SHELLY
D: Danny, what are you doing here?
C: DANNY
D: What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
C: SHELLY
D: Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
E: to other man in background
C: DANNY

Harry and Shelly are kissing and giggling. As she is watching this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose, takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the rose as if it were a microphone
C: GRAMMOO
