M: NICK (V.O.)
M: In my younger and more vulnerable

M: advice: "always try to see the best
M: in people," he would say...
M: A gentle snow begins to fall, obscuring the light...
M: NICK (V.O.)
M: As a consequence, I'm inclined to
M: reserve all judgements.
M: The snow grows heavier.
M: NICK (V.O.)
M: But even I... have a limit.

C: NICK
D: He was... the single most hopeful person I have ever met... And am ever likely to meet again. There was something about him...

E: V.O.
N: IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK'S V.O. Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up...!

D: The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired... making the liquor cheaper.
E: V.O.
N: FADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street.
C: NICK

D: In old money East Egg.
E: V.O.
N: BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen. FOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house.

E: V.O.
N: BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom whacks the polo ball...
C: NICK
D: His name was Tom Buchanan.
E: V.O.
N: The ball nearly hits one of Tom's gardeners...
C: NICK
D: When we were at Yale together he'd been a sporting star.
E: V.O.
N: BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! Tom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch...
C: NICK
D: But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs.
E: V.O.
N: Tom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty.
C: TOM
D: I thought I told you not to call me here...!
E: INTO PHONE
N: PULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony. Clunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and grasps his hand with overbearing strength.

E: CONT'D

D: You see? Made me who I am today.

C: TOM
D: If you're any good.
E: CONT'D
N: Nick fumbles as Tom charges him--
C: TOM
D: Ha-ha-ha!
E: CONT'D
N: Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of vaulting doors, and into...
S: INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white curtains whip and snap in the breeze... CLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck. We hear the giggle of naughty children... BOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with it, a low, thrilling voice...
C: DAISY
D: Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely?
E: O.S.
N: Suddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are framed by a strawberry-blonde bob. CLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating...
C: NICK
D: Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her. A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see...
E: V.O.
N: She whispers dramatically...
C: DAISY
D: Do they miss me in Chicago?
C: NICK
D: Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love.
C: DAISY
D: How gorgeous.
E: UNIMPRESSED
C: NICK
D: They're absolutely in mourning... They're crying...
C: DAISY
D: NO--
C: NICK
D: They're wailing...
C: DAISY
D: NO--
C: NICK
D: They're screaming, they're shouting...
C: DAISY
D: NO--
C: NICK
D: "Daisy Buchanan, we can't live without you!"
C: DAISY
D: I'm p-paralyzed with happiness...!
N: Daisy takes Nick's hand and squeals with childish glee as she drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor. He stares up... And, a mysterious, athletic girl glares back. This is 22 year old, JORDAN BAKER.
C: DAISY
D: Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON: Nick, the blood drains from his face...
C: NICK
D: She was the most frightening person I'd ever seen--
E: V.O.
N: Nick rights himself and extends his hand.
C: NICK
D: I've seen your face on the cover of "Sporting Life". Nick Carraway...
N: But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look).
C: NICK
D: But I enjoyed looking at her.
E: V.O.
C: JORDAN
D: I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember...
N: Daisy turns to Nick with scandalous delight.
C: DAISY
D: I know! This summer I'll sort of, fling you and Jordan together...
N: As Tom prepares drinks at the bar, he glances skittishly at a white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal.
C: DAISY
D: I'll push you into linen closets, and out to sea in boats...
E: CONT'D
C: JORDAN
D: I'm not listening to a word!
N: Irritated, Tom turns to Nick.
C: TOM
D: Nick, Daisy tells me you're over at
C: WEST EGG;
E: MORE
C: TOM
D: throwing your lot in with those social-climbing, primitive New Money types...?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Well, my little shack is cardboard box at eighty a month.
C: DAISY
D: Your life is adorable.
N: Jordan toys with a golf club, and speaks with bored contempt.
C: JORDAN
D: I know somebody in West Egg.
C: NICK
D: I don't know a single--
N: Jordan turns dramatically.
C: JORDAN
D: Oh, you must know Gatsby.
N: Daisy, a sharp intake of breath.
C: DAISY
D: Gatsby?
N: CLOSE ON: Daisy, as she struggles to control rising emotion.
C: DAISY
D: What Gatsby...?
E: CONT'D
N: Before anyone can reply, Henri announces--
C: HENRI
D: Madame, le diner est servi!
N: As Jordan WHACKS a golf ball into a makeshift cup - a trophy on the floor - waiters sweep open the doors and the curtains flutter up again.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT
N: Daisy, Nick, Jordan and Tom sit at a long, sumptuously laid table. Food, wine, laughter, smoking... DISSOLVING ABSTRACTLY: Through fragments of conversation...
C: DAISY
D: Would you like to hear a family secret? Its about the butler's nose...
C: JORDAN
D: Things went from bad to worse...
C: DAISY
D: Nicky... I heard a rumor, that you were getting married to a girl out west...
C: NICK
D: Its a libel, I'm too poor.
C: JORDAN
D: They have to be old so they die quickly...
C: NICK
D: Can't we talk about something else? Anything? Crops? You're making me feel uncivilized Daisy--
N: This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom.
C: TOM
D: Civilization's going to pieces! Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this fellow Goddard?
C: NICK
D: Why no...
N: Tom stands and begins to pace--
C: TOM
D: Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races...
N: Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant--
C: TOM
D: Will have control of things.
E: CONT'D
C: DAISY
D: Tom's been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in THEM
E: WICKEDLY
C: TOM
D: It's been proved. Its scientific.
C: DAISY
D: We've got to beat them down.
E: subtly mocking Tom
N: SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. BRINNNGGG!
C: TOM
D: Excuse me... I'll be right back.
N: He goes inside. An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down.
C: DAISY
D: I'm sorry...
N: She follows Tom into the house. Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan.
C: NICK
D: Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor...
C: JORDAN
D: Shhhh... Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.
N: A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond.
C: NICK
D: Is something happening?
C: JORDAN
D: I thought everybody knew.
C: NICK
D: I don't.
C: JORDAN
D: Tom's got some woman in New York.
C: NICK
D: Got some woman?
C: JORDAN
D: She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time... Don't you think?
N: Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang open and Tom and Daisy return to the table.
C: DAISY
D: I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn't he?
E: a tense gayety
C: NICK
D: I'm not even faintly like a rose--
C: TOM
D: So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club.
C: DAISY
D: Nicky, stay--
C: NICK
D: I have to work early.
C: TOM
D: Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two.
N: Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all freeze. BRINNNGGG! PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek.
C: NICK
D: None of us could ignore that fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency...
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER
N: Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides:
C: DAISY
D: Oh Nicky...
C: NICK
D: What?
C: DAISY
D: Its just, well, you see, I think everything's terrible anyhow. You know I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I've had very bad time Nicky... I'm pretty cyncical about everything.
N: Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence. Nick tries to change the subject--
C: NICK
D: Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything?
C: DAISY
D: Pammy? Oh yes...
N: Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk.
C: DAISY
D: Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.'
E: CONT'D
N: She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers...
C: DAISY
D: All the bright precious things fade so fast...
E: CONT'D
N: And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the water, and across the bay toward Gatsby's castle...
C: DAISY
D: And they don't come back.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT
N: WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby's dock, A MAN - his dark silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky. In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, pulling up at his bungalow.
S: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT
N: Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can see The Man gazing intently across the bay.
C: NICK
D: When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor's dock.
E: V.O.
N: Nick goes closer, and watches The Man...
C: NICK
D: And something told me it was... Mr. Gatsby.
E: V.O.
N: The Man reaches out--
C: NICK
D: He seemed to be... reaching toward something out there in the dark.
E: V.O.
N: A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness...

S: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT
N: Nick, troubled...
C: NICK
D: The green light.
C: DOCTOR
D: Green light?
N: Nick struggles with a painful memory...
C: NICK
D: I don't want to talk about this Doctor.
N: Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits:
C: NICK
D: I can't talk about THIS.
E: CONT'D
C: DOCTOR
D: Then write about it.
E: DELICATELY
C: NICK
D: Write?
E: SKEPTICAL
C: DOCTOR
D: Yes. Write.
C: NICK
D: Why would I do that?
C: DOCTOR
D: After all, you said that writing brought you solace, once upon a time.
C: NICK
D: Yeah, well. It didn't bring anyone else much solace... I wasn't any good.
N: The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept.
C: DOCTOR
D: No one need ever read it. You can always burn it.
C: NICK
D: What would I write about?
C: DOCTOR
D: Anything. Whatever you can't quite talk about; a memory; a thought; a place... Write it down.
N: CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge...
C: NICK
D: A place...
E: TO HIMSELF
N: Slowly he takes the pen. We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks; AS THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS, we hear them as voice-over.
C: NICK
D: The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY
N: HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance.
C: NICK
D: New York's dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city...
E: V.O.
N: IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here.
C: NICK
D: ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
E: V.O.
N: A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek. DISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful wasteland...
C: NICK
D: ...This fantastic farm was ever- watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg...
E: V.O.
N: NICK'S POV: A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads: "Dr. T.J. Eckleberg."
C: NICK
D: ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes brooded over it all like the eyes of God.
E: V.O.
S: INT. TRAIN - DAY
N: Tom, flushed with booze and heat, glances covertly around the halted carriage. Nick sits opposite.
C: NICK
D: Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club....
E: V.O.
N: As the carriage moves, Tom suddenly pulls Nick to his feet.
C: NICK
D: But the day took an unexpected turn...
E: V.O.
N: Tom drags Nick from the moving train.
C: TOM
D: Come on--!
S: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY
N: As the train pulls off, Nick, exasperates, chases Tom.
C: NICK
D: What are we doing?
E: O.S.
C: TOM
D: Trust me!
C: NICK
D: Wait a second would you!?
C: TOM
D: Dominate Nick! Dominate!
E: CALLS BACK
N: PAN DOWN TO DISCOVER: Tom and Nick outside a small garage. A sign reads: "GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold."
S: INT. WILSON'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, spiritless man, appears from the back office.
C: TOM
D: Hello Wilson! How's business?
C: WILSON
D: I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car?
E: UNCONVINCING
C: TOM
D: I've got my man working on it.
C: WILSON
D: Works pretty slow, don't he?
C: TOM
D: Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else?
E: COLDLY
C: WILSON
D: I don't mean that, I just...
N: Wilson's grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual.
C: MYRTLE
D: If its business you're talking, you should be talking to me... Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down...
E: to her husband
N: Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom.
C: MYRTLE
D: Hurry up!
E: CONT'D WITHOUT TURNING
C: WILSON
D: Oh, sure... Sure...
N: Wilson hurries out back.
C: TOM
D: Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway.

E: playing hard to get
C: TOM
D: Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister... She'll like him...
E: glancing to Nick
C: NICK
D: Oh no, that's alright, I'm busy...
C: MYRTLE
D: Catherine's said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know.
C: NICK
D: Really I can't...
C: TOM
D: Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? That's rude.
E: whispers to Nick
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: The muffled sounds of sex... CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves into a saucer of milk. Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE. She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand.
C: CATHERINE
D: I'm Catherine; ain't we havin' a party?
C: NICK
D: Oh, I'm... I'm not sure now's a good time-- I was just going--
N: But Nick's exit is blocked.
C: MRS. MCKEE
D: Hello...!
N: MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek.
C: MR. MCKEE
D: Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you.
E: extending his hand
C: NICK
D: Nick Carraway.
C: MRS. MCKEE
D: Where're the kids?
N: Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him...
C: CATHERINE
D: What's the matter? Don't ya like me?
N: SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress.
C: MRS. MCKEE
D: Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable!
C: MYRTLE
D: It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like!
E: with impressive hauteur
N: Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt.
C: TOM
D: Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep.
N: Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet.
C: NICK
D: Tom, I really should be going...
E: making for the door
C: TOM
D: Nonsense...
E: grabbing Nick's arm
C: NICK
D: Tom; I don't think-- Daisy's my--
N: Tom pulls Nick back toward the party.
C: TOM
D: Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that's OK, I make no judgment; but we've got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball?
C: CATHERINE
D: Yeah. Ain't we good enough for ya?
N: Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly lands herself in his lap.
C: CATHERINE
D: Take off yer hat and stay awhile...
E: CONT'D
C: TOM
D: Hey Nick! McKee's in the artistic game.
C: MCKEE
D: Photography.
C: TOM
D: Nick's artistic.
C: NICK
D: No...
C: MCKEE
D: Really?
C: NICK
D: Ah, no, well, I write a little...
N: Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine raises her voice above the music.
C: CATHERINE
D: Do you live on Long Island, too?
C: NICK
D: I live at West Egg.
C: CATHERINE
D: Really? I was there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him?
C: NICK
D: I live right next door to him...
C: CATHERINE
D: He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. You know, the evil German king...
N: CUT TO: Tom raising Myrtle's skirt suggestively.

D: I'm not one of those models...! But you can if you want...
E: CONT'D
N: Catherine leans close and whispers in Nick's ear.
C: CATHERINE
D: Neither of them can stand who they're married to.
C: NICK
D: Doesn't she like Wilson either?
C: MYRTLE
D: ...He's a greasy little scumbag!
E: OVERHEARS
N: Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine.
C: CATHERINE
D: No thanks; I feel just as good on nothing at all...
N: With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill...
C: CATHERINE
D: Nerve pills, I get them from a doctor in Queens. You want one?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: My nerves are fine thanks...
N: Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down.
C: NICK
D: I had been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon...
E: V.O.
N: DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing... The whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder, nauseatingly violent... As Catherine undresses Nick...
C: NICK
D: That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all... And suddenly, I began to like New York.
E: V.O.
N: As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet!
C: MYRTLE
D: ...I've got to get a massage, and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave!
N: Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip...
C: MYRTLE
D: My dear I'm giving you this dress!
E: CONT'D
N: Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress.
C: MRS. MCKEE
D: Adorable! Adorable!
N: SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom window, observing the infinite life of the city...
C: NICK
D: High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street...
E: V.O.
S: INT. SANITARIUM - NICK'S ROOM - WINTER - NIGHT
N: Nick, now alone, pen in hand, writes furiously.
C: NICK
D: ...and I was him too, looking up and wondering...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE STREET BELOW MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself upstairs looking out from Myrtle's window.
C: NICK
D: I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life...
E: V.O.
N: POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity...
S: INT. MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: SUDDENLY WE HEAR Tom violently yelling!
C: TOM
D: You've got no right to speak her name!
N: Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed...
C: MYRTLE
D: Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it whenever I want! Daisy! Dai--
N: SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle's nose! CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION! PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one more of the countless many that play out in this vast city...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY
N: Nick's been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many hand-written pages on his lap. He admits...
C: NICK
D: I have no clue how I got home.
S: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING
N: Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light. CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake. He realizes he's been sleeping on the porch in his underwear.
C: NICK
D: But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling...
E: V.O.
N: His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes... A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up...
C: NICK
D: ....that Gatsby was watching me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY
N: The Doctor leans forward.
C: DOCTOR
D: Watching you...?
E: SLIGHTLY INCREDULOUS
C: NICK
D: Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me...
C: DOCTOR
D: And how do you know that?
C: NICK
D: Because I got an invitation... I was the only one.
N: FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's egg blue, stands on Nick's doorstep, holding a silver tray on which rests an invitation...
C: NICK
D: No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby's...
E: CONT'D
N: The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: "Dear Mr. Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would attend my little party..."
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TWILIGHT
N: A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan towards Gatsby's gates.
C: NICK
D: You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited...
E: V.O.
N: As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby's gates, a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the verge and roars cheekily by...
C: NICK
D: The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby's...
E: V.O.
N: CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby's magnificent castle. Illuminated fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs.
S: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT
N: Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a doorman who shrugs.
C: NICK
D: And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby's door...
E: V.O.
N: A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into...
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS
N: A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...!
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT
N: Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays. Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the impossible variety of guests at Gatsby's...
C: NICK
D: A caravansary of...
E: V.O
N: IMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over...
C: NICK
D: Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby's beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists... Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers... Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors... Casino collectors...
E: V.O. MORE
C: NICK
D: Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven!
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar...
C: NICK
D: Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby?
E: to the bartender
N: He brandishes his invitation.
C: NICK
D: I live just next door...
E: CONT'D
C: BARTENDER
D: Mr. Gatsby? I've never seen him sir. Why, no one has...
N: The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini.
C: NICK
D: Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk.
E: V.O.
N: He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to:
S: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT
N: Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party...
C: NICK
D: Wow.
N: As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks toward him from behind...
C: VOICE
D: I thought I might see you here...
N: Startled, Nick turns to find... Jordan Baker.
C: NICK
D: Hello.
C: JORDAN
D: I remembered you lived next door...
C: NICK
D: Its like... an amusement park.
C: JORDAN
D: Shall we?
N: Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps...
C: NICK
D: Did you get an invitation?
C: JORDAN
D: People aren't invited to Gatsby's.
C: NICK
D: Well I was... I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby?
N: A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects...
C: TEDDY
D: He was a German spy during the war.
C: JORDAN
D: Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway.
C: NICK
D: A German spy...?
E: TO TEDDY
N: Teddy's annoying East Egger friend, NELSON, chimes in...
C: NELSON
D: No, no, no, no. He's the Kaiser's assassin.
N: And the third of the East Egger trio, LANGUID GIRL, adds...
C: LANGUID GIRL
D: I heard he killed a man once.
C: NELSON
D: Its true!
C: LANUID GIRL
D: You look at him sometimes when he thinks no one's watching... I'll bet he killed a man.
C: TEDDY
D: Kills for fun! Free of charge.
C: NELSON
D: Well he's already richer than God.
N: Nick turns to Jordan; an alarmed whisper.
C: NICK
D: You don't believe he killed a man do you...?
C: JORDAN
D: Let's go find him, and you can ask him yourself...
E: WICKEDLY
N: As the dance-floor erupts, and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey is announced, Jordan leads Nick off...
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING
N: MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS! As Nick and Jordan bound up a winding staircase, Jordan teases seductively...
C: JORDAN
D: Oh, Mr. Gatsby...! Shall I lead you into his clutches?
E: TO NICK
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING
N: BANG! Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room. A stout, middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity.
C: OWL EYES
D: You won't find him...!
N: He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan.
C: OWL EYES
D: This house and everything in it, are all part of an elaborate disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn't exist.
E: CONT'D
C: JORDAN
D: Phooey; I've met him!
C: OWL EYES
D: Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the Murderer? I've been wandering his halls drunk for about a week now - but no matter where I look, I can't find anyone who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby.
C: JORDAN
D: Well I don't care; he gives large parties - and I like large parties, they're so intimate; at small parties there isn't any privacy.
E: BLITHELY DISMISSIVE
C: NICK
D: But if that's true; what's all this for...?
E: slowly to Owl Eyes
C: OWL EYES
D: That, my dear fellow, is the question...
N: Owl Eyes looks to the window; and Nick and Jordan follow his gaze to... Gatsby's garden, where, as the band hits fever pitch, and twilight becomes night... THE PARTY HAS BEGUN!!!!
S: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT
N: As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening's many fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!! On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks!
C: NICK
D: I didn't expect all this...
C: JORDAN
D: What did you expect?
E: COY
C: NICK
D: I don't know...
C: JORDAN
D: Disappointed?
C: NICK
D: Not in the slightest...
N: Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss...
C: TEDDY
D: Penny-less pantywaist!
E: TO NICK
N: Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away...
C: TEDDY
D: I'm stealing her away Carraway!
E: CONT'D
N: Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces...
C: ORCHESTRA LEADER
D: Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's "A Jazz History of the World", and accompanying fireworks!
N: Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off--
C: TEDDY
D: Look around you! Rich girls don't marry poor boys--
N: On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis... Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray...
C: MAN
D: Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?
C: NICK
D: Yes; The Ninth Battalion.
N: CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty.
C: MAN
D: I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport?
C: NICK
D: The whole thing's incredible - I live next door... (brandishing his now
E: VERY TIPSY
C: CRUMPLED INVITATION)
D: He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby, no one's met him; they say he's third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil!
N: At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink from a waiter's tray and hands it to Nick...
C: MAN
D: I'm afraid I'm not a very good host, old sport... I'm Gatsby.
N: CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops.
C: NICK
D: Oh.. I'm very sorry-- I... I've had so much to drink...
E: MUTTERING APOLOGIES
N: The delirious opening chords of Tostoff's "History" coincide with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky!
C: GATSBY
D: I thought you knew, old sport.
E: APOLOGETICALLY
N: Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum.
C: NICK
D: His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in.
E: V.O.
N: All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby.
C: HERZOG
D: Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire.
N: Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick.
C: GATSBY
D: I'm trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport?
N: Nick shakes himself from his reverie.
C: NICK
D: What time?
C: GATSBY
D: Any time that suits you.
N: Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan.
C: GATSBY
D: Lovely to see you Miss Baker.
E: CONT'D
N: He kisses her lightly on the hand.
C: GATSBY
D: If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me.
E: CONT'D TO NICK
N: As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement.
C: NICK
D: I expected him to be...
C: JORDAN
D: Old and fat?
C: NICK
D: Well, yes; young men don't just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island.
C: JORDAN
D: He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it...
C: NICK
D: Why not?
C: JORDAN
D: I don't know... I just don't believe he went there...
N: Jordan is interrupted by a voice.
C: HERZOG
D: I beg your pardon...
N: She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them.
C: HERZOG
D: Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone.
E: CONT'D
C: JORDAN
D: Me?
E: SURPRISED
C: HERZOG
D: Yes, madame.
N: As Vladimir Tostoff's erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of Gatsby in the library window... Nick, unsettled, watches her go...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER
N: Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone... Seeing Nick, she rushes to him...
C: JORDAN
D: Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense...
N: Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan.
C: TEDDY
D: Where have you been!? The car's waiting!
N: Jordan is dragged out the door... Nick, on tenterhooks follows, as Jordan calls back...
C: JORDAN
D: Simply amazing! It all makes sense. It all makes sense...
S: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - NIGHT
N: The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles. Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs.
C: NICK
D: What makes sense...?
C: JORDAN
D: Everything... But here I am tantalizing you...
N: The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine. Jordan, a mysterious smile as she leans out the window.
C: JORDAN
D: And I swore I wouldn't tell.
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: But...
C: JORDAN
D: Nick. I'm sorry, I swore I wouldn't tell.
N: The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified... A voice startles him.
C: GATSBY
D: Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning.
N: Herzog appears behind Gatsby.
C: HERZOG
D: Philadelphia on the phone, sir.
N: Gatsby nods, then smiles that intoxicating smile.
C: GATSBY
D: Good night, old sport...
C: NICK
D: Good night. Thank you.
N: Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside. As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch. SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly...
C: OWL EYES
D: Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!?
N: The beep of a horn catches Nick's attention. Jordan, leaning out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him.
C: JORDAN
D: Come and see me... We'll have tea! I'm in the phone-book!
N: Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn. CLOSE ON: Nick. As he reaches the stone-pass separating his yard from Gatsby's, he stops; a familiar feeling...
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands, phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he raises his hand in formal farewell.
C: NICK
D: We rode in the hydroplane... And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until...
E: V.O
S: INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - MORNING
N: Nick is eating breakfast, studying bonds, when his glass of orange juice begins to rattle and shake. Puzzled, Nick hurries to the window...
S: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS
N: Gatsby's yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick's drive and skids to a stop. Nick emerges to his porch. Gatsby leaps out!
C: GATSBY
D: Its pretty isn't it, old sport...? Haven't you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine. Get dressed... We're having lunch!
T: SLAM CUT TO:
N: I/E. GATSBY'S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The Duesenberg whips and winds along a tree-lined road... Gatsby, beyond nervous, drives with reckless intensity.
C: GATSBY
D: Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow?
C: NICK
D: My... opinion?
C: GATSBY
D: Yes, yes, your opinion!
N: Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life!
C: GATSBY
D: I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You've heard the stories...?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: WELL--
C: GATSBY
D: I'll tell you God's truth. God's truth about myself! I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now... I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it's a... a family tradition.
E: raises right hand
N: As Gatsby's speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick's
T: V.O. fades up.
C: NICK
D: The way he spoke... No wonder people thought he was lying...
E: V.O.
C: GATSBY
D: After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe!
C: NICK
D: Europe?
N: Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands...
C: GATSBY
D: Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago...
N: PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: I/E. GATSBY'S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY Gatsby hasn't stopped for breath...
C: GATSBY
D: Then came the war, old sport...
C: NICK
D: Just when I thought it couldn't be any more fantastical...
E: V.O.
C: GATSBY
D: It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life...
C: NICK
D: He became a war hero, single- handedly defeating the German army!
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion.
C: GATSBY
D: In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis guns...
N: Something catches Nick's eye... NICK'S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson's Garage.
C: GATSBY
D: ...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead.
E: CONT'D
N: SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing!
C: GATSBY
D: I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea.
E: CONT'D
N: SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick's lap.
C: GATSBY
D: Here! That's the one from Montenegro.
E: CONT'D
N: It looks authentic.
C: GATSBY
D: Turn it.
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary.
E: READS
C: GATSBY
D: That's right.
N: SLAP! A photograph joins the medal.
C: GATSBY
D: Here's another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand.
C: NICK
D: What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true?
E: V.O.
N: DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New York, he continues...
C: GATSBY
D: But don't take my word for it. At lunch, I'm going to introduce you to one of New York's most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I've told you, and vouch for my good character...
E: O.S.
N: I/E. GATSBY'S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway.
C: NICK
D: I'm sure that's not necessary...
N: Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity.
C: GATSBY
D: Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don't want you to think I'm just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I'm going to make a very big request of you today.
C: NICK
D: A big request?
C: GATSBY
D: Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon.
C: NICK
D: Jordan...? What's she got to do with it?
E: caught off guard
C: GATSBY
D: Oh, I assure you it's nothing underhand. Miss Baker's an honest sportswoman; she'd never do anything that wasn't alright...
N: RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside.
C: COP
D: Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb!
C: GATSBY
D: All right, old sport! Alright.
E: CALMLY
N: Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket...
C: COP
D: Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!
E: EMBARRASSED
N: The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge!
C: NICK
D: One of your old Oxford pals?
C: GATSBY
D: Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year. I imagine he'll be at lunch too...
E: ADDS PROUDLY
C: NICK
D: By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused...
N: Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR. An orchestral melody surges...
C: NICK
D: I didn't know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all...
E: V.O.
N: As the orchestra builds, Gatsby's car shoots into Manhattan, through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below... SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity...
C: NICK
D: Even Gatsby could happen...
E: V.O.
N: BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into:
S: INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY
N: The sweaty grind of music shakes the air. On stage a pianist, THE PROFESSOR, bangs out a sizzling tune! PULL THROUGH A DOUBLE-GLASS MIRROR INTO:
S: INT. DICK DIVER'S CUTS BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS
N: DISCOVER: Nick and Gatsby entering the cramped shop... In the center of the room a tall, distinguished, grey-bearded man in an exquisitely cut suit, and with gold rings on every finger, is having a beard trim. This, is MEYER WOLFSHEIM.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Ah my boy...!
N: They embrace.
C: GATSBY
D: Meyer, Meyer...
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: You smell so good.
C: GATSBY
D: Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr. Wolfsheim.
N: Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway. I know all about you.
C: NICK
D: Really?
C: WOLD
D: Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always talking about you.
N: Gatsby raps a coded knock on a hidden door at the back of the shop. The door slides open, the rumble of music pours out...
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Come, join us for a little lunch...
E: SINISTER
S: INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS
N: Gatsby ushers Wolfsheim and Nick down narrow creaking stairs, through the crowd and into the smoke-filled speakeasy... ECU: Nick, taking in his NEW, SEEDY surroundings.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Tell Walter Chase; "he shuts his mouth or he doesn't get a penny..."
E: whispers to Gatsby
C: GATSBY
D: We'll talk about that later...
N: The HEAD WAITER appears.
C: HEAD WAITER
D: Highballs, Mr. Gatsby?
C: GATSBY
D: Yes, highballs it is. You take good care of my friend here!
E: points to Nick
N: A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad flappers, yells from a corner booth.
C: COMMISSIONER
D: Hey Jay...! You're under arrest!!!
N: Gatsby smiles and tips his hat.
C: GATSBY
D: You be careful now. You're turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner. See, that's the Commissioner back there.
E: TO NICK
N: Gatsby, the king here, greets patrons high and low... He sees SENATOR GULICK at the craps table.
C: GATSBY
D: You be careful at those tables now Senator!
E: CONT'D
C: SENATOR GULICK
D: Of course! I'll put a bet on for you Jay!
N: Waiters clear a front row table - best seat in the house - Gatsby helps Wolfsheim to his. Wolfsheim eyes the girls on the stage. Gatsby flashes Nick a charming smile.

E: to the waiter TO NICK
N: Wolfsheim glances to Gatsby, and then turns again to Nick...
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: So... How is the bond business Mr. Carraway?
C: NICK
D: It's fine, thank you.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: I understand you're looking for a BUSINESS GONNEGTION--
C: GATSBY
D: No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man.
N: Woldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further... Gatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up.
C: GATSBY
D: Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to make THAT call. Meyer, do you mind?
E: gesturing to Nick
N: Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby's acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such... medals. And, an Oggsford man. Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford?
C: NICK
D: I've heard of it...
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted. With a friend, with someone like you, he would never so much as look at your wife...
C: NICK
D: I'm not... married.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: But you work on Wall Street, right?
C: NICK
D: Yes...
E: TOTALLY CONFUSED
N: Nick studies Wolfsheim, noticing an oddity about his outfit.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Looking at my tiepin?
N: CLOSE ON: The pin.
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Finest specimen of human molars...
E: CONT'D
N: Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns.
C: GATSBY
D: Gentlemen. Everything alright...?

D: Other people's wives? Ah... I see.
E: taking his seat
N: Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim.
C: GATSBY
D: Other people's wives... Meyer?
E: CONT'D
N: Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls...
C: WOLFSHEIM
D: Well, my work here is done. I'll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women...
N: Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off...
C: GATSBY
D: You'll have to excuse him... In his old age, he's prone to "digress..." He's a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway...
C: NICK
D: Who is he anyhow?
C: GATSBY
D: Meyer? He's a gambler.
N: Over Nick and Gatsby's shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction...
C: NICK
D: An actor?
C: GATSBY
D: Meyer? No. He's the man who fixed the 1919 World Series.
C: NICK
D: Fixed it?
C: GATSBY
D: Fixed it.
C: NICK
D: How did he manage that?
C: GATSBY
D: He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He's a very smart man. Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of...
E: tries to change subject
N: Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table.
C: TOM
D: Hey Nick! Nick! Where've you been!? Daisy's furious you haven't called up.
N: Nick and Gatsby stand.
C: NICK
D: This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.
N: CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand.
C: GATSBY
D: I'm so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance.
N: Tom turns back to Nick.
C: TOM
D: I wouldn't have expected to find you in this temple of virtue.
C: NICK
D: I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats--

C: MAITRE'D
D: Will the gentleman be joining?

E: FRUSTRATED
C: JORDAN
D: Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant.
N: As Nick's frustration and Jordan's embarrassment grow--

D: It's all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he's going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is--
C: JORDAN
D: If you'll just have a seat--

D: What is this big request!?

C: DAISY
D: Tell them Daisy's changed her mind!
E: SCREAMS
C: JORDAN
D: Daisy! Please, everyone's waiting!
N: Daisy reaches for the pearls around her neck...

D: I'd never seen a girl so in love with her husband. A week later, Tom crashed his car. The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers...
E: CONT'D MUSES CYNICALLY
N: As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick turns to Jordan; he's struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought.
C: NICK
D: It's a strange coincidence, isn't it? Gatsby's house being just across the bay...
N: Jordan whirls round--
C: JORDAN
D: It's no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she'd wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her.
N: Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time.
C: NICK
D: All that for a girl he hasn't seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...? The modesty of it.

C: JORDAN
D: Long Island, please.
C: NICK
D: And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby?
C: JORDAN
D: She's absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can "happen to drop by."
E: a stern whisper
N: CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure...
C: NICK
D: I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew?
E: V.O.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT
N: Nick's taxi pulls past Gatsby's mansion, ablaze with light.

D: When I returned home, Gatsby's was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But... There wasn't a sound.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - NIGHT
N: As Nick's taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through the illuminated trees toward Nick.
C: NICK
D: Your place looks like the World's Fair... or Coney Island!
C: GATSBY
D: Ah, does it? I've... I've just been glancing into some rooms... Let's go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car--
E: TERRIBLY ANXIOUS
C: NICK
D: It's too late tonight.
C: GATSBY
D: Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use of it all summer...
C: NICK
D: I must go to bed...
N: Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery.
C: NICK
D: Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea.
E: CONT'D
C: GATSBY
D: Oh, that's alright. I don't want to put you to any trouble...
C: NICK
D: What day would suit you?
C: GATSBY
D: What day would suit you...? I don't want to put you to any trouble...
C: NICK
D: Day after tomorrow alright?
C: GATSBY
D: Day after tomorrow? Well, I'd... I'd want to get the grass cut.
N: They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where Nick's ragged lawn ends and Gatsby's manicured one begins.
C: GATSBY
D: There's another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-- You don't make much money, do you?
E: CONT'D
C: NICK
D: Not really.
C: GATSBY
D: If you'll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I'm saying right? You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport?
C: NICK
D: Trying to.
C: GATSBY
D: Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money.
C: NICK
D: I've got my hands full.
N: Gatsby's face falls.
C: GATSBY
D: You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you.
C: NICK
D: No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just a favor.
N: Nick's sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod.
C: NICK
D: Happy to do it.
E: CONT'D
C: GATSBY
D: A favor?
C: NICK
D: Yes.
N: As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life...
C: GATSBY
D: Ah, right, right... Goodnight.
C: NICK
D: Goodnight.

N: TOP SHOT: An enormous mower clatters through frame, carving Nick's unkempt lawn into a fresh, broad, band of green. REVEAL: An army of gardnders giving Nick's lawn and garden a make-over, fresh paint, new flowers, trimmed hedges...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - THE FOLLOWING DAY
N: Heavy rain now falls. Gatsby, dressed in white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold tie, leads a dozen umbrella-holding servants across the lawn. Herzog holds an umbrella over Gatsby; the other servants shelter extravagant floral arrangements in crystal vases... Nick watches the parade through his window, opening his door just as Gatsby arrives; the servants continue inside. On the porch, Gatsby looks around distractedly.
C: GATSBY
D: One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal...
N: An awkward beat.
C: NICK
D: The grass looks fine.
C: GATSBY
D: Grass?
N: Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing.
C: GATSBY
D: What Grass?
E: CONT'D

S: INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: TIGHT ON: A mantelpiece clock, ticking in the tense silence. WIDER: The room is crowded with absurdly extravagant floral arrangements. Nick sits watching as Gatsby intensely paces. The silence stretches, and stretches... Finally...

D: Perhaps more flowers?
C: GATSBY
D: I think they did a fine job, don't you?
C: NICK
D: Beautiful.
C: GATSBY
D: You think it's too much?
C: NICK
D: I think it's what you want.
C: GATSBY
D: I think so too... She'll be impressed, won't she old sport?
C: NICK
D: I am.
N: With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly checks his watch. Another long silence... PUSH IN ON: Gatsby... SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet!
C: GATSBY
D: I can't wait all day. I'm leaving!
C: NICK
D: Don't be silly. It's just two minutes to four...
N: But Gatsby heads for the door...
C: GATSBY
D: Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!
N: BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy's Rolls Royce arriving out front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic.
C: NICK
D: It's her.
N: PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing...
S: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - DAY
N: Daisy's chauffeur-driven Rolls pulls up in the muddy drive. As Nick assists Daisy from the car...
C: DAISY
D: Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?
N: She looks at him with a mysterious smile.
C: DAISY
D: Why did I have to come alone? Are you in love with me?
E: CONT'D

D: That's the secret of Carraway Castle. Tell your chauffeur to go far away.

C: DAISY
D: He is in love with me...
E: TO HERSELF

D: What's funny?
N: KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door.
C: NICK
D: One moment...
S: INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS

D: What are you doing?
N: Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into...
S: INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of breath... The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy's, is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, choking murmur.
C: DAISY
D: I'm certainly glad to see you again.
N: Gatsby's face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. Finally, he finds words...
C: GATSBY
D: I'm... certainly glad to see you as well.
N: Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating. EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the TENSION--
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; frozen on the edge of a chair. The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur.
C: GATSBY
D: We've met before...
N: SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby's elbow... And falls! And breaks!
C: GATSBY
D: Ah... sorry...
E: CONT'D
N: He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again!
C: NICK
D: It's an old... clock.
E: IDIOTICALLY
C: DAISY
D: Lovely though. A lovely... clock.
E: desperate for small talk
N: Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle. Gatsby takes a seat. A long silent beat.
C: DAISY
D: We haven't met for many years.
E: CONT'D
C: GATSBY
D: Five years next November.
E: an automatic reflex
N: The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing.

D: Tea?
E: ABRUPTLY
C: GATSBY
D: Thank you old sport.
E: DYING
C: DAISY
D: Darling thank you.
E: ALSO MORTIFIED
N: Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. A long, terrible silence... Suddenly Nick stands.
C: NICK
D: I just need to... pop into town.
C: GATSBY
D: Town...?
E: HORRIFIED
C: NICK
D: The village; I'll be right back.

C: GATSBY
D: She's embarrassed?
C: NICK
D: Just as much as you are.
C: GATSBY
D: Don't talk so loud!
C: NICK
D: You're acting like a little boy! You're rude. Daisy's in there all alone and...
N: Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and heads back into the living room.
S: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS
N: Nick runs for a TREE whose leaves shield against the rain.
C: NICK
D: Looking over my story so far, I'm reminded that for the second time that summer...

N: WIDE: Nick beneath the tree looks tiny, and very alone.
C: NICK
D: I was guarding other people's secrets.
E: V.O.
S: INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: LATER. Nick re-enters, bedraggled, rain-soaked.
C: NICK
D: Once again I was within...
E: V.O.
N: He tries to get Gatsby and Daisy's attention, to no avail... The lovers are completely and totally absorbed in each other.
C: NICK
D: And without...
E: V.O.
N: Nick bangs pots in the sink - still nothing. He clears his throat:
C: NICK
D: Its... stopped raining.
N: Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows.
C: GATSBY
D: Yes, it has... Hasn't it?
E: TO DAISY
N: He stands, walks to the window and looks out across the bay.
C: GATSBY
D: What do you think of that, Daisy? Come look.
E: CONT'D

D: Do you like it?
C: DAISY
D: I love it...! But how do you live here all alone?
C: GATSBY
D: I don't. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people...

D: It's just... Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before.
C: GATSBY
D: If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light...
C: DAISY
D: What green light?
C: GATSBY
D: The one that burns all night at the end of your dock.
N: As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay...
C: NICK
D: Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever. Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.
E: V.O.
N: Nick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase. He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume...
C: NICK
D: Who's this? Your father?
C: GATSBY
D: No, no.. That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.
N: Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby...
C: DAISY
D: You never told me you had a pompadour... or a yacht.
E: TEASES
N: Gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk...

N: They admire a scrapbook together.
C: DAISY
D: You saved my letters...
E: TOUCHED
C: GATSBY
D: This was my first photo of you.
N: As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER:
C: DAISY
D: We cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing. Come home, I'll be here waiting and hoping, for every long dream of you to come true... Come home Jay...
E: V.O.
N: BBBRRRNNNGGG! The phone shrills.
C: GATSBY
D: Excuse me.
N: Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns away... He lowers his voice.
C: GATSBY
D: Well I can't talk now old sport...
E: INTO PHONE CONT'D
N: As the timbre of Gatsby's voice darkens we PUSH CLOSER.

D: I said a small town.
E: INTO PHONE CONT'D

D: He must know what a small town is.
E: INTO PHONE CONT'D
N: BOOOOMMM! A storming wind bangs open the French windows! As Nick moves to shut them, he glimpses Gatsby...
C: GATSBY
D: Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town...
E: INTO PHONE CONT'D FRIGHTENING
N: Gatsby rings off abruptly, and catches Nick's eye - a tense moment - which Gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile. We hear the distant, jaunty sounds of a pipe organ...

D: Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake! Shall we?
E: CONT'D

N: Daisy, wearing a flowing robe and heels, dances a Charleston with Nick. An elaborate picnic, complete with candelabras and a mountain of cushions, is laid out on the floor. There, Gatsby sits, looking on, flush with joy. Slowly though, Gatsby's expression turns introspective. As he watches Daisy dance, memories flood back to him...

C: DAISY
D: I wish that it could always be like this...

S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Long shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... WIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited men. We hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby...
C: GATSBY
D: I've been meaning to call you up. I'm sorry, I've been... so busy.
E: O.S.
C: NICK
D: Is everything alright?
E: O.S.
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: An unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent paintings. He hunches over the phone...
C: GATSBY
D: Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love.
C: NICK
D: I hear you fired all your servants?
E: O.S.
C: GATSBY
D: Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn't gossip... until we decided what we're going to do... You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand? They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for.
E: CLARIFIES
N: Herzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman pours coffee and then recedes...
C: GATSBY
D: What's the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Nick holds the phone close to his ear, trying to hear Gatsby above the din around him; his work is piled high...
S: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Gatsby whispers into the phone...
C: GATSBY
D: Nick... Daisy's ready. Shes ready. But there's just one thing. She's requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport? Daisy needs you. I... We need you. Will you come old sport?
E: EXCITED AN ADMISSION
S: INT. PROBITY TRUST - NICK'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: PUSH IN ON: Nick. A decision looms...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY
N: WIDE SHOT: The imposing Buchanan mansion bakes in the sun...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter.
C: TOM
D: You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year...
N: Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates...
C: TOM
D: Or wait a minute; it's the opposite...
E: CONT'D
N: Tom stands and strolls to the open French window...
C: TOM
D: The sun is getting colder every year...
E: CONT'D
N: Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table. CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby. The tension is excruciating. Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the bay.
C: TOM
D: How I'd like to be out on that bay today.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can see the outline of his castle.
C: GATSBY
D: I'm right across from you. Right there.
E: POINTS
C: TOM
D: So you are.
E: UNIMPRESSED
N: Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy.
C: GATSBY
D: Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking.
C: TOM
D: What light?
N: Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy's...
C: GATSBY
D: You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I--
N: With sudden intensity Daisy stands!
C: DAISY
D: It's so hot...
E: on the verge of tears
N: Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard.
C: DAISY
D: Everything's so confused.
E: CONT'D
N: She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with the paperweight-sized lighter.
C: DAISY
D: What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon...? And the day after that... ...and for the next thirty years? Let's all go to town! Who wants to go to town?
E: CONT'D she snaps it again TURNS SUDDENLY
N: Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock.
C: TOM
D: Town!? Women... They get these notions...
N: Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy's trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet...
C: GATSBY
D: Daisy...
E: WHISPERS
C: DAISY
D: You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man... in Times Square...
E: as if they are alone
N: CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening.
C: DAISY
D: The man in the cool, beautiful, shirts.
E: CONT'D
N: CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar.
C: NICK
D: She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen...
E: V.O.
N: SUDDENLY Tom explodes!
C: TOM
D: Let's go to town! I'm perfectly willing...! That's a marvelous idea! Henri! Have the car brought around immediately!
C: DAISY
D: Just like that? Can't anyone at least have a cigarette?
C: TOM
D: We've smoked all through lunch.
C: DAISY
D: Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss.
C: TOM
D: It was your great idea Daisy. Why don't we!? We'll all go to town!
N: Daisy doesn't budge.
C: DAISY
D: I've changed my mind... You brute.
E: TEASES
C: TOM
D: You've got me all excited, and now you don't want to go? We'll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey... It will be fun.
E: a dangerous intensity
C: DAISY
D: Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... Come on, Jordan.
N: As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns calmly to Gatsby.
C: TOM
D: Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?
N: Then turns and calls to Henri...
C: TOM
D: Henri! Get some whiskey! Two bottles, wrapped in a towel.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: Shoes shifting on gravel. Gatsby and Nick stand uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women. BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel. Daisy and Jordan follow.
C: TOM
D: Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coupé? And I'll drive everyone else in your circus wagon.
C: GATSBY
D: I don't think there's much gas, old sport.
N: Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare.
C: TOM
D: Plenty of gas. And if we run out, then we'll stop at a drug store. I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays... Isn't that right, Mr. Gatsby?
E: looks at the gauge savagely eyes Gatsby
N: A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom's arm.
C: DAISY
D: You take Nick and Jordan, Tom!
N: She slips quickly into the coupé...
C: DAISY
D: We'll meet you at the Plaza! I'll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes...
E: CONT'D
N: Gatsby's and Tom's eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance. Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust. I/E. GATSBY'S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY Tom throttles forward, watching Jordan and Nick...
C: TOM
D: You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I've made a small investigation of this fellow.
C: JORDAN
D: And you found he was an Oxford man?
E: CONDESCENDING
C: TOM
D: Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake!
N: With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on!
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY
N: HIGH AND WIDE: The Duesenberg tears into the Valley...
C: JORDAN
D: We're almost out of gas Tom...
E: O.C. MOCKING
S: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON'S GARAGE - DAY
N: SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to a stop at Wilson's... Wilson doesn't budge. He's staring with sickly eyes at the giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg.
C: TOM
D: Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let's have some gas... Do I have to do it myself?
E: GETS OUT
C: WILSON
D: I'm sick. I'm all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West.
C: TOM
D: Your wife does...?
N: Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle's face, badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates...
C: NICK
D: Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control...
E: V.O.
C: WILSON
D: I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin' whether she wants to or not.
N: Tom isn't listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high- speed, threatening to leave him in the dust!
C: TOM
D: What do I owe you!?
C: WILSON
D: Dollar twenty.
N: The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And then jumps into the Duesenberg.
C: TOM
D: You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow!
N: He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he floors the gas and peels out after the coupé! I/E. GATSBY'S CAR/TOM'S COUPÉ - DAY VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and skidding PERILOUSLY close. As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the glimmering, golden city...
T: SLAM CUT TO:
S: INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY
N: CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a bell-boy makes ice-cubes...
C: TOM
D: That's enough...
N: The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration.
C: DAISY
D: Open another window.
C: NICK
D: There aren't any more.
C: DAISY
D: Then telephone for an axe...
C: TOM
D: Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it.
C: GATSBY
D: Why not let her alone, old sport?
C: TOM
D: That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?
C: GATSBY
D: What is?
N: Tom turns to Gatsby...
C: TOM
D: 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up?
C: DAISY
D: Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute.
N: Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly.
C: TOM
D: Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.
C: GATSBY
D: No, not exactly.
C: TOM
D: Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford.
C: GATSBY
D: Yes - I went there.
N: Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting.
C: TOM
D: Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford!
C: DAISY
D: Tom...!
N: Gatsby stands.
C: GATSBY
D: I told you I went there.
E: slow, intense
C: TOM
D: I heard you, but I'd like to know when.
C: GATSBY
D: You'd like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man.
N: Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. But they are all looking at Gatsby.
C: GATSBY
D: You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war.
E: CONT'D
N: Nick can't help but smile.
C: NICK
D: I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back.
E: V.O.
C: DAISY
D: I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself...
N: But Tom's not done yet.
C: TOM
D: Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.
C: GATSBY
D: Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on.
C: TOM
D: What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?
N: They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content.
C: DAISY
D: He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control!
C: TOM
D: Self-control! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife? Well, if that's the idea you can count me out... See, nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they'll throw everything overboard and we'll have intermarriage between black and white!
C: JORDAN
D: We're all white here, Tom.
C: GATSBY
D: Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me!
C: TOM
D: You must be crazy.
C: GATSBY
D: No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me!
C: JORDAN
D: We should go...
C: GATSBY
D: Daisy and I have nothing to hide...
C: DAISY
D: Jay let's go, please...!
C: TOM
D: Sit down Daisy!
C: GATSBY
D: Yes, Daisy, please sit down.
E: REASSURING
N: Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note.
C: TOM
D: What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.
C: GATSBY
D: I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...!
N: Tom turns to Daisy sharply.
C: TOM
D: You've been seeing him for five years?
C: GATSBY
D: Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know...
C: TOM
D: Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then - but I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a god-damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.
N: Tom starts to make himself a drink...
C: GATSBY
D: No...
C: TOM
D: She does, though... And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time...
C: DAISY
D: You're revolting...
N: Daisy's voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with thrilling scorn...
C: DAISY
D: Do you know why we left Chicago...? I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree.
E: CONT'D
N: Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy.
C: GATSBY
D: That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever.
N: Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly.
C: DAISY
D: Why, how could I love him, possibly?
C: GATSBY
D: You never loved him.
N: Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing.
C: DAISY
D: I never loved him.
C: GATSBY
D: That's right...
C: TOM
D: Not at Kapiolani?
C: DAISY
D: No.
C: TOM
D: Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry...? Daisy? Never?
E: a husky tenderness
C: DAISY
D: Please don't.
C: TOM
D: Daisy...
N: Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone.
C: DAISY
D: There, Jay.
N: She trembles as she looks to Gatsby...
C: DAISY
D: You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past. I did love him once; but I loved you too.
E: CONT'D begins to sob
C: GATSBY
D: You loved me too?
E: shocked, uncomprehending
C: TOM
D: Even that's a lie. She didn't know you were alive. There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.
E: SAVAGE
N: The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby.
C: GATSBY
D: I want to speak to Daisy alone. She's all excited now...
C: DAISY
D: Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true.
C: TOM
D: Of course it wouldn't.
N: Daisy turns to her husband.
C: DAISY
D: As if it mattered to you.
C: TOM
D: Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.
C: GATSBY
D: You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you.
C: TOM
D: Nonsense.
C: DAISY
D: I am, though.
E: with visible effort
C: TOM
D: She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler!
N: Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby.
C: TOM
D: Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim's bunch.
E: CONT'D
N: Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly.
C: TOM
D: See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter!
E: CONT'D
C: GATSBY
D: What about it, old sport?
C: TOM
D: Don't call me `old sport!' This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now.
C: GATSBY
D: Well your friend Walter Chase isn't too proud to come in on it.
C: TOM
D: I've been giving that some thought. How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim?
C: GATSBY
D: It's called `greed,' old sport.
C: TOM
D: That's right; you've got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend... I'm surprised he hasn't tried to drag you in...
E: TO NICK
N: Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this.
C: TOM
D: My God, he has...
E: CONT'D
C: GATSBY
D: He's got nothing to do with--
C: TOM
D: With your little racket... Daisy... Can't you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he's just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...!
E: TO DAISY
C: GATSBY
D: The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that's it, and now I've just as much as you; so that means we're equal!!
E: a vicious sneer
N: Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn.
C: TOM
D: Oh no, no, we're different; I am, (gesturing at Nick and
C: JORDAN)
D: They are...
E: now at Daisy
C: SHE IS;
E: MORE
C: TOM
D: we're all different from you - we were born different, it's in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...!
E: CONT'D
N: Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage.
C: GATSBY
D: SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!!
N: Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he restrains himself from ripping Tom apart...
C: NICK
D: Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had "killed a man."
E: V.O
N: Tom snorts a dismissive laugh.
C: TOM
D: That's right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners...
N: Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the corner, on the verge of tears.
C: DAISY
D: My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper.
N: Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if Tom suddenly no longer exists.
C: GATSBY
D: Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don't listen to him Daisy.
N: Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently.
C: GATSBY
D: We're going back to Louisville to be married. Then we're going to live together in our house; it's--
E: CONT'D
N: There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room. CLOSE ON: Nick.
C: NICK
D: He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on...
E: V.O.
C: DAISY
D: Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore!
N: Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom.
C: TOM
D: You two start on home... In Mr. Gatsby's car.
E: TO GATSBY
N: Daisy is alarmed now.
C: TOM
D: Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over.
E: CONT'D
N: Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her.
C: GATSBY
D: Daisy...!
N: Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel.
C: TOM
D: Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? Nick?
C: NICK
D: What?
C: TOM
D: Want any?
C: NICK
D: No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I'm thirty.
N: Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink...
C: TOM
D: Happy birthday...
N: Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought...
C: NICK
D: Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness...
E: V.O.
N: NICK'S POV: To the setting sun and the Queensboro Bridge...
C: NICK
D: The formidable stroke of thirty died away, as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight, towards death...
E: V.O.

S: INT. WILSON'S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT
N: MYRTLE FLIES PAST CAMERA as Wilson drags her across the room!
C: WILSON
D: God knows everything you've been doing!
N: Grabbing his wife's hair he presses her face to the window.
C: WILSON
D: You might fool me but you can't fool God!
E: CONT'D
N: OVER WILSON'S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg.
C: WILSON
D: God sees everything!
E: CONT'D
N: Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level crossing. The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby's yellow car waiting on the other side of the crossing. CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper.
C: MYRTLE
D: He's here...
E: thinking its Tom
N: WHACK! Myrtle gives a sudden backhand to Wilson's face as she twists from his grasp!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WILSON'S GARAGE - TWILIGHT
N: Standing outside his restaurant, the owner, MICHAELIS sees Myrtle rush out of the garage shouting hysterically.
C: MYRTLE
D: Stop, Tom, please, stop!
N: I/E. GATSBY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS SUDDENLY! Myrtle appears in the headlights of Gatsby's car... ECU: The sleeve of the pink suit and the 'Daisy' signet ring, as Gatsby's hand on the wheel tries to veer away...!
C: GATSBY
D: No...!
N: BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle! SLOW MOTION, TERRIBLE, NIGHTMARISH, EXPRESSIONISTIC IMAGES: Glass shattering, blood splattering, Daisy screaming, Myrtle's body flying through the air, her pearls showering the night like a thousand new stars... THUMP. Her torn open body hits the ground. CLOSE ON: The giant billboard, the towering eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleberg, watching everything... DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WHITES OF THE EYES TO:
S: INT. TOM'S COUPÉ - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON: The coupe's blinding headlights. As the coupé nears, Nick, Tom and Jordan see the commotion.
C: TOM
D: Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last... Let's take a look..
C: JORDAN
D: Must we?
C: TOM
D: Just a look.
S: INT. WILSON'S GARAGE - NIGHT
N: The dim garage is lit only by a swinging yellow globe. Wilson stands on the raised threshold of his office, swaying and wailing a high, horrible call.
C: WILSON
D: O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od!
N: A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones. CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd. CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound... MYRTLE'S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table. Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless. CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom's reaction. A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Sir. Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step away--
E: TO TOM
C: TOM
D: Get off me...! I'm fine. I'm fine.
E: regains his composure
C: POLICEMAN
D: You knew her?
C: TOM
D: No... Not really...
E: a long pause
C: POLICEMAN
D: Well then I have to ask you to step back.
C: TOM
D: What happened...?
C: POLICEMAN
D: She ran out `inna road. Son-of-a- bitch didn't even stopus car.
N: A well-dressed African American man steps near.
C: WELL-DRESSED MAN
D: I saw it! It was a yellow car; big yellow car.
N: CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization. PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror. The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up.
C: MICHAELIS
D: Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job.
N: Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry...
C: WILSON
D: You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!
N: Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson.
C: TOM
D: Pull yourself together...
E: a soothing gruffness
N: Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him upright and pushes him into:
S: INT. WILSON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely.
C: TOM
D: Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coupé. That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon.
N: The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom.
C: POLICEMAN
D: What color's your car?
C: TOM
D: Blue, a coupé; we've come straight from New York.
C: MICHAELIS
D: Yeah, they just stopped...
N: The policeman accepts, suspicious still...
C: POLICEMAN
D: Alright... Blue.
N: In the relative calm of the office, Wilson's clouded, desperate eyes look up at Tom.
C: WILSON
D: Who owns the yella' car...?
C: TOM
D: Fella named Gatsby; he's a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about...
E: a tiny pause
C: WILSON
D: Maybe he was the one foolin' with Myrtle; maybe that's why he killed her...?
C: TOM
D: Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows...
N: Wilson starts sobbing again.
C: WILSON
D: Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!
N: He rests his head on Tom's shoulder... Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers...

S: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT

C: TOM
D: I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. Come in and have some supper while you wait...
N: Tom opens the door.
C: NICK
D: No thanks. I'll wait outside.
N: Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain.

D: What is the matter with you?
N: Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick's arm.
C: JORDAN
D: Won't you come in, Nick?
C: NICK
D: No... thanks.
C: JORDAN
D: It's only half past nine...
C: NICK
D: No. I think I've had enough... Of everyone.
N: CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look... But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside...
S: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: As Nick's feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he is startled by a voice from the shadows...
C: GATSBY
D: Hello old sport...
N: Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy's window. His pace quickens.
C: NICK
D: What are you doing!?
C: GATSBY
D: Just sitting here...
C: NICK
D: Yes, I can see that.
C: GATSBY
D: Did you see any trouble out on the road?
C: NICK
D: Trouble!? That woman you ran down is dead Jay!
C: GATSBY
D: I thought so... I told Daisy I THOUGHTS SO--
C: NICK
D: Daisy? Do you hear yourself--
C: GATSBY
D: Its better that the shock should come all at once--
C: NICK
D: What's wrong with you!? How could you!?
C: GATSBY
D: Please... Keep your voice down, old sport.
C: NICK
D: Tom was right! You're nothing but a goddamn coward!
C: GATSBY
D: Keep your voice down... There. Was. No. Point. In. Stopping.
E: THREATENING
C: NICK
D: NO POINT!?
C: GATSBY
D: It, it killed her instantly. I--
C: NICK
D: Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open!
N: Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain...
C: GATSBY
D: I understand-- It was... my fault. This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I... tried-- to turn the wheel.
C: NICK
D: She?
N: SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light... Henri emerges. AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths. Finally, Henri goes back in. CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization.
C: NICK
D: It was Daisy?
E: CONT'D
N: Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits.
C: GATSBY
D: You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us.
N: CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel...
C: GATSBY
D: It all happened so quickly. It wasn't her fault...
E: CONT'D MORE
C: GATSBY
D: It was my fault. I should have taken the wheel... No one must know. Promise me. No one. Promise me.
E: CONT'D INTENSE
C: NICK
D: Jay-- You shouldn't be here. You should get out of here.
N: Gatsby gazes back to the house...
C: GATSBY
D: No. No. No. I'm going to wait. I'll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy's locked herself in her room, and she's going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever--
C: NICK
D: Tom won't touch her. He's not even thinking about her...
C: GATSBY
D: Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don't trust him.
N: Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace.
C: NICK
D: Alright. Alright... You wait here. I'll see if there's any commotion.
C: GATSBY
D: Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport.
S: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT
N: Nick skirts the terrace... Rounding the corner, Nick, unseen in the shadows, can see Tom and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table, a plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them. As Tom speaks intently and earnestly at Daisy, his hand falls gently upon hers and she nods tiredly in agreement...
C: TOM
D: Its going to be all right...
N: Then, very slowly, Daisy lays her head on Tom's shoulder. CLOSE ON: Nick, shocked... angry.

C: NICK
D: Jay? Everything alright...?
N: Exhausted, Gatsby turns...
C: GATSBY
D: Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything's just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light... So... Give me a hand will you old sport?
E: beckons to the car
N: CLOSE ON: Nick.
C: NICK
D: I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was...
E: V.O.
C: NICK
D: Jay... You oughtta go away.
N: He helps Gatsby cover the car.
C: NICK
D: Tonight. They'll trace your car.
E: CONT'D
C: GATSBY
D: Go away? I can't leave now. Not tonight.
E: as if Nick is crazy
C: NICK
D: Do you understand that a woman has been killed--?
N: Nick follows him from the garage toward the house.
C: GATSBY
D: Daisy's going to call in the morning. Then we'll make plans, to go away together.
C: NICK
D: But Jay she--
N: Sensing Nick's tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all doubt with intense certainty.
C: GATSBY
D: She just needs time to think... She'll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think.
E: he continues, calm
C: NICK
D: JAY--
C: GATSBY
D: She just needs to think. She's going to call in the morning.
N: Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility... He turns to go in but stops.

C: GATSBY
D: You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I'm empty.
E: MORE
C: GATSBY
D: I suppose that's why I make things up about myself... But I`ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport. My folks were, well--
E: CONT'D
N: As Gatbsy continues, Nick's V.O. FADES UP:
C: NICK

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN
N: In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward the end of the dock.
C: NICK
D: It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby's... extraordinary gift for hope.
E: V.O.
C: GATSBY
D: ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too.
C: NICK
D: A gift that I have never found in any other person...
E: V.O.
C: GATSBY
D: I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be.
C: NICK
D: And which it is not likely I shall ever find again.
E: V.O.
C: GATSBY
D: I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month...
N: Finally, Nick is able to ask:
C: NICK
D: What was in the letter?
N: Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green light across the bay...
C: GATSBY
D: The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn't been able to return--
N: In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby wrote in that fateful, last letter: "Daisy, the truth is... I'm penniless."
C: GATSBY
D: I asked her to wait until I'd made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure.
E: O.C. CONT'D
T: The IMAGE of Daisy fades...
C: GATSBY
D: You see, I felt married to her... That was all.

D: A personal call? Of course.
N: The GARDENER comes to the foot of the steps.
C: GARDENER
D: I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby.
C: GATSBY
D: Not today. It's so beautiful. You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?
E: TO NICK
N: Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs...
C: GATSBY
D: Let's go for a swim. I'll have the phone transferred to the pool...
E: CONT'D
N: As Gatsby heads toward the pool, Nick checks his watch...
C: NICK
D: Jay, I've got to go. I have to work.
C: GATSBY
D: I understand... Well, I'll walk you out.
N: Gatsby leads Nick toward the side gate. At the gate...
C: NICK
D: I'll call you up.
C: GATSBY
D: Do, old sport, please do. I suppose Daisy'll call too.
E: A THOUGHT
C: NICK
D: I suppose so... Well... Goodbye.
N: Nick lingers... Then they shake hands and he starts away. Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls:
C: NICK
D: They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together!
E: CONT'D
N: First Gatsby nods politely, and then his face breaks into that radiant and understanding smile.
