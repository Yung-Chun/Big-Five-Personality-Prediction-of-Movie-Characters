T: FADE IN:
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: A MAN recumbent on the bed, playing a TRUMPET, his white dress shirt defaced by a flower of blood. The room is ON FIRE all around him. He is playing Miles Davis' moody, Spanish-influenced SAETA, a haunting and lonely piece.
C: DANNY
D: My name is Tom Van Allen ... or Danny Flynne ...
E: V.O. beat
N: A DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED. The money burning, tiny flaming pieces floating around the room. DANNY (cont'd) ... I don't know anymore. (beat) Maybe I'll let you decide. Maybe you can help me, friend. As you can see, I don't have a hell of a lot of time left. A PHOTOGRAPH of a woman taped to the inside of a trumpet case. The photo is on fire. Only her smile remains. DANNY (cont'd) Avenging angel ... Judas Iscariot ... Loving husband ... Prodigal Son ... The prince of Denmark ...? A GREETING CARD on the floor, a teddy bear and the word, CONGRATULATIONS! on the front. The wind from the fire blows the card open. Inside, a BLACKENED BLOOD STAIN. DANNY (cont'd) All of these? None of these? You decide, friend. You decide. Trumpet player? Speed freak? (beat) Speed freak. (beat) That's as good a place as any. (beat) But first, a little background on the mad world of the tweaker ..
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN.
S: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
N: EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a glass beaker.
C: DANNY
D: Methedrene was first distilled by a Japanese scientist before WWII. Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a good thing when they saw it.
E: V.O.
S: INT. JAPANESE ZERO - DAY
N: A wide-eyed, jaw-grinding KAMIKAZE PILOT with a death-grip on the controls.
C: DANNY
D: This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks he can survive this without a scratch.
E: V.O.
N: STOCK BATTLE FOOTAGE - a Japanese Zero crashes into a battleship, bursting into a ball of flames.
C: DANNY
D: Maybe not. By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese population had a meth problem after the war: factory workers, soldiers, pilots. Maybe that's why it took two bombs to get 'em to surrender. A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker.
E: V.O. beat
S: INT. HOUSE - DAY
N: A wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house.
C: DANNY
D: In the fifties, the housewives got ahold of it. Dexedrine. Benzedrine. Methedrene ...
E: V.O
N: She attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette. DANNY (cont'd) Now that's a classic speed freak for you, skinny and cleaning the house. I'll bet her poor husband never knew what hit him in the sack either.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: THE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor. STOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV.
C: DANNY
D: There were even rumors that one of our presidents dabbled with mysterious "energy shots". Imagine that: a slammer in the White House.
E: V.O.
N: Kennedy talking animatedly. DANNY (cont'd) If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev never got a word in edgewise.
S: EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: A sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type.
C: DANNY
D: By the late 60's the government finally cracked down and sent the whole thing underground. Bikers controlled the market for a while.
E: V.O.
S: INT. TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT
N: The trucker gripping the wheel with the same death-grip as the Kamikaze.
C: DANNY
D: But now anyone with a basic chemistry kit and the right ingredients can cook it up at home.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT
N: A CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION.
C: DANNY
D: Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak buying up all the cold medicine he can lay his hands on at three in the morning.
E: V.O.
N: The cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin plastered on his face. DANNY (cont'd) Take it from me, he ain't got no cold. He's a cook. Look in his kitchen and you'll find a whole grocery list of unsavory ingredients.
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: TRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers.
C: DANNY
D: Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid, match heads for red phosphorus, ether and of course the cold medicine .. that's for Ephedrene, soon to become Methedrene
E: V.O.
N: CONTINUE TRACKING to a series of BURNERS, BEAKERS and TUBING DANNY (cont'd) This guy's a regular Julia Child. Problem is, I'll be even Miss Julia fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time. The freaky cook sees something he doesn't like. His eyes widen. DANNY (cont'd) Oh-oh.
S: EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
N: As the structure explodes.
S: INT. PARTY HOUSE - UNKNOWN
N: Thick blankets and tinfoil taped over the windows. A huge container of empty beer cans, washed and neatly arranged. Lines of crystal meth on a mirror as precisely arranged as Nails as the Nuremberg rally. A GROUP OF TWEAKERS in the middle of a binge. Two skinny women, NANCY and Teresa bent over a drawer-full of neatly folded socks on the living room floor. They stare at the drawer as if they were pondering a Rembrandt.
C: NANCY
D: It ain't right
C: TERESA
D: You think?
C: NANCY
D: Something's off.
C: TERESA
D: We can do better.
N: They take the socks out and being rearranging them again. Three guys squeezed onto a couch together: KUJO, JIMMY THE FINN and CREEPER. Kujo is talking a blue-streak. He makes Dennis Leary took mealy-mouthed. Creeper and Jimmy stare straight ahead, clearly bugging.
C: KUJO
D: So the alphabet, I mean look at it, there's 26 letters. Why not 27 or 28 or 106? And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u. What the hell is up with that?
C: CREEPER
D: And sometimes y.
C: KUJO
D: What I'm saying is that I love it! It's great. I could go on all night about it.
N: And he does. KUJO (cont'd) Let's take every letter individually. I mean, let's really break the mother's down. DANNY is sitting in an armchair. He is the only one who looks tired. He sits there, taking the scene in.
T: ALL SOUNDS FADE OUT
C: DANNY
D: And so this is where I find myself. No. I should choose my words more wisely: this is the world I sought out. The land of the perpetual night- party. Day swallowing night and night swallowing day. The crank compressing time like some divine piston on its awesome downstroke.
E: V.O.
N: DANNY'S P.O.V. - SCANNING THE ROOM. NO SOUND. The girl's folding the socks ... Kujo ranting on ... Creeper and Jimmy the Finn grinding their jaws ... the BLANKETS AND TINFOIL ON THE WINDOWS. DANNY (cont'd) We've been at this for three days ... or is it four? Tweakerrs, lokers, slammers coming and going, swearing eternal allegiance and undying love for one another, only to wake up after the binge and realize you wouldn't walk across the street to piss on one of 'em if their head was on fire. (beat) Is it three days or is it four? BACK ON DANNY. He blinks lethargically. DANNY (cont'd) I know what you're thinking. But don't give up on me just yet. And for God's sake, don't pity me. Don't make any judgments until you've seen my whole story. (beat) And keep your eyes open. (beat) Nothing is what it seems. Suddenly ...
C: KUJO
D: OH SHIT! WE'RE OUT OF DRUGS!
E: O.S.
S: INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Danny and Jimmy the Finn walking towards the front door.
C: DANNY
D: How the hell did we get this detail?
C: JIMMY
D: Guess it's our turn.
N: Danny nods.
C: DANNY
D: What time is it?
C: JIMMY
D: Twelve
C: DANNY
D: Midnight?
S: EXT. PARTY HOUSE - DAY
N: As the door opens, Danny discovers that it is TWELVE NOON and the sun is blazing. The party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building crammed in the middle of BUSY BUSINESS DISTRICT at a major intersection. Jimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light.
C: DANNY
D: Where to?
C: JIMMY
D: I know a guy.
C: DANNY
D: Lead the way.
N: They slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses.
C: JIMMY
D: Nice day
C: DANNY
D: I hadn't noticed. I've seen you around. What's your name?
E: beat
C: JIMMY
D: Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
C: DANNY
D: Why's that?
C: JIMMY
D: My features. They're Finnish.
C: DANNY
D: You don't say.
C: JIMMY
D: Finland is a country.
C: DANNY
D: Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
S: INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Danny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN. Danny and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking at. A GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand. He is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity.
C: JIMMY
D: Bobby?
C: BOBBY
D: Shhh.
N: Bobby never takes his eyes off his arm. BOBBY (cont'd) (whispering) They're coming.
C: JIMMY
D: What?
E: likewise whispering
C: BOBBY
D: The spiders.
N: Bobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening. BOBBY (cont'd) (sing-song) I'm ready for you this time. Bobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm.
C: BOBBY
D: Aha! Yeah! You thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby!
E: super rapid-fire
N: Bobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with bug spray. BOBBY (cont'd) With Bobby you thought you could fuck? Danny and Jimmy wait silently. Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied he has killed the imaginary spiders. He looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug- addled confusion. BOBBY (cont'd) Who the fuck are you?
C: JIMMY
D: It's me ... Jimmy
N: Bobby squints.
C: BOBBY
D: Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
C: JIMMY
D: Yeah.
C: BOBBY
D: What can I do for you?
C: JIMMY
D: Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
N: Danny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously. There is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE.
C: BOBBY
D: Don't pay her no mind.
N: A MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby. She is between the mattress and the box springs. BOBBY (cont'd) Shut the hell up, goddamit! Bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand. New MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath. BOBBY (cont'd) I got no vocation skills! What the fuck you want from me? (keeps slapping) I got no vocation skills!
C: JIMMY
D: Hey man, take it easy.
N: Bobby immediately stops. Looks at Jimmy with incredulity.
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: JIMMY
D: Come on. Ease off the girl.
N: Bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises. Danny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two stainless steel spears. Bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then Danny.
C: BOBBY
D: Did you bring the plastic men?
N: Bobby nods towards something behind Danny. Danny and Jimmy don't move or speak. BOBBY (cont'd) Did you bring the plastic men? (beat) Did you bring the plastic men? Bobby rubs his nose.
C: BOBBY
D: Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men?
C: DANNY
D: Nah, we didn't bring 'em. That's just your good crank talking, brother.
N: Bobby tilts his head. DANNY (cont'd) We were hoping to catch a few ourselves if you'll hook us up.
C: BOBBY
D: You bring the plastic men?
E: calmer
C: DANNY
D: Like I said.
C: JIMMY
D: Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. Rhymes with ...
E: he draws a blank
C: DANNY
D: Hobby?
N: Bobby twists a smile, revealing speed-blackened teeth.
C: BOBBY
D: That's a good man. I like that.
C: DANNY
D: Hey, Bobby, look .. What you got going with your old lay, it's none of our business. We're just a couple of dope fiends trying to score.
E: calmly
N: Bobby lowers his speargun.
C: BOBBY
D: Two eight balls?
N: Jimmy breaths a sigh of relief.
S: EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Danny and Jimmy exit the room, closing the door behind them. Danny looks at Jimmy.
C: DANNY
D: Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
C: JIMMY
D: Oh ... that. Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
N: WHAP, WHAP! Two spears plunge through the cheap door, stopping inches from Danny's head. They run like hell.
S: EXT. SKY - DAY
N: TIME LAPSE. The sun plunges down. The sky turns black. The moon races up and down. The sky lightens. The sun races up and down. Night comes again.
S: INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Everyone crashing. Jonestown, post Kool-Aid. It looks like they have all simultaneously fallen asleep where they were standing or sitting. Danny stirs awake. Looks around. He stretches. KNOCKING OVER A BOTTLE OF BEER. ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS the beer SPLATTER to the floor. IT IS UNNATURALLY LOUD. DANNY staring intently at the spilling liquid. The beer pools up on the floor. Danny transfixed by the image. The last few drops of beer LOUDLY splashing down.
S: EXT PAYPHONE - NIGHT
N: Danny on the phone.
C: DANNY
D: C.I. number 678-43K-107 Tanner and Garcetti
E: beat
N: He hangs up.
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Danny waiting in the shadows. A car, sans headlights, pulls into the alley and stops. Danny emerges from the shadows, opens the back door and lays on the back seat.
S: INT. CAR - SAME
N: Two guys in suits in the front, TANNER and GARCETTI. Tanner. blue eyes and SHAVED HEAD, an air of ex-military around him. Garcetti: swarthly and serious, a MIASMA OF BAD-ASS ATTITUDE.
C: DANNY
D: I've got a hot one.
E: lying on the back seat
C: TANNER
D: You go, boy.
C: DANNY
D: If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
N: Tanner drives out of the alley.
C: TANNER
D: Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
C: DANNY
D: Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
S: EXT. PART - NIGHT

C: DANNY
D: Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
N: QUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS.
C: TANNER
D: No last name?
C: DANNY
D: It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
N: Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges over.
C: GARCETTI
D: This the guy?
C: DANNY
D: It speaks!
N: The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a "WANTED POSTER". Bobby's mug shot glaring.
C: DANNY
D: That's him. He's a lot prettier in person though.
C: GARCETTI
D: Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
C: DANNY
D: Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.

E: beat
C: TANNER
D: God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
C: DANNY
D: Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
N: Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt. They head back to the car. DANNY (cont'd) Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay?
C: TANNER
D: Danny, I'm touched.
C: DANNY
D: Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
C: GARCETTI
D: Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
C: DANNY
D: Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
N: Garcetti throws Danny up against the car. Nose-to-nose.
C: GARCETTI
D: I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
C: DANNY
D: Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
N: Garcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off.
C: DANNY
D: You're welcome.
S: EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: A GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking lot. BOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a Bobby's sheet-covered body. A SWAT TEAM packing up nearby. One of them suddenly does a graceful little Tai-Chi gesture. A LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs. REVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers. His expression gives nothing away. A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb and runs into a storm drain. As the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT.
N: The place cries out "YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!" Danny exist the stairwell and approaches his door. A WOMAN ONE DOOR DOWN FROM DANNY'S ROOM struggles with her groceries. When she goes to open the door, one of the bags breaks, spilling its contents onto the floor. Danny walks over.
C: DANNY
D: Let me help you with those.
E: approaching
N: She scoops up the groceries and hurries into her room. Slamming the door behind her. DANNY (cont'd) (loud through the door) And to think Miss Manner was living down the hall from me and I didn't even know it! There is a can on the floor. Danny bends down to pick it up. DANNY (cont'd) Hey, you left a can of ... He looks at the can. INSERT - CAN The label is in CHINESE. DANNY (cont'd) ... some Chinese looking shit out here. No reaction. DANNY (cont'd) I'll just leave it by the door here. (beat) I'm going now! After a moment, the door swings open. Danny is holding the can out with a big smile on his face. DANNY (cont'd) You really oughta be more careful. This is not a good neighborhood. The woman smiles. A pretty smile. Sad too.
C: WOMAN
D: I was rude. I'm sorry. I'm kinda new around here.
C: DANNY
D: You did the right thing. What is this stuff anyway?
E: handing the can over
C: WOMAN
D: Fermented soybean curd.
C: DANNY

C: WOMAN
D: Colette Aragon. Thank you, Danny.
N: She closes the door abruptly.
S: INT. RESIDENTAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: The burning room from the opening scene. Danny's dirty clothes on the bed. He emerges from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist. There is a BIG STAR-SHAPED SCAR on Danny's shoulder. He walks over to the closet, takes a METAL LOCKBOX from the top shelf and puts it on the bed. Pulls a key from his pocket and unlocks the box. He sits there staring at the contents for a moment, then gingerly takes them out ... ... CLOTHES. A white dress shirt, black slacks and wingtips.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Danny dresses in his clothes, combing his hair. He goes back in the lock box and pulls something else out ... ... A TRUMPET CASE. He walks over to the cheap vanity and sits down in front of the mirror and stars for a very long time.
C: DANNY
D: My name is Tom Van Allen I play the trumpet.
E: beat
N: He slowly opens the trumpet case revealing a GLEAMING HORN inside. Runs his fingers along the length of it and up to ... ... A PHOTO OF A WOMAN taped to the inside of the lid. A self- conscious smile on her face like she's uncomfortable with having her picture taken. DANNY (cont'd) (distant) My name is Tom Van Allen. I play the trumpet. He takes the trumpet from the case - A CHECK from a LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY and a DRIVER'S LICENSE with Danny's picture and the name TOM VAN ALLEN. DANNY (cont'd) My name is Tom Van Allen and I play the trumpet. He starts to play. "Saeta" again. AN IMAGE appears on THE BLANK WALL BESIDE HIM. MOVE OFF DANNY AND UP TO THE IMAGE. IN THE IMAGE - A HUGE LAKE in the middle of the DESERT. CONTINUE MOVING IN ON IMAGE AS WE CUT TO ...
S: EXT. SALTON SEA - SUNSET (FLASHBACK)
N: Danny and THE WOMAN FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH sitting on the shore. Watching the sunset. She is his wife, LIZ. Danny playing "SAETA" on his trumpet. Danny and Liz are alone, except for the myriad birds, silhouetted by the falling sun. A gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around her face. A dying fish on the waterline, gills pumping for oxygen. Danny finishes playing. Silence. IMPORTANT: DANNY WILL BE KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.
C: LIZ
D: That's so ...
E: not finishing the word
N: DANNY / TOM Melancholy?
C: LIZ
D: Yes, it hurts my heart. What a beautiful composition.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: And the performance?
C: LIZ
D: A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
E: goofing
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Thank you. Thank you very much.
C: LIZ
D: And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Again, I thank you.
C: LIZ
D: I was talking about Miles.
N: Danny playfully tackles her to the ground.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: You, madam, are a heartless wench.
C: LIZ
D: And you've got wiener breath.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Really?
C: LIZ
D: It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
N: Danny starts kissing her over and over again.
C: LIZ
D: Tom! Gross!
E: laughing
N: She finally pushes him off. He rolls off of her and snuggles up next to her, spooning her in the sand.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: You know how I make that song melancholy when I play it? I think of what my life would be like without you.
N: Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny.
C: LIZ
D: Tom, let's spend the night here.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: There's no motels around here.
C: LIZ
D: No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Danny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet. THE IMAGE IS STILL PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM.
C: DANNY
D: Okay, we'll stay. We'll stay.
E: at the vanity, whispering
N: NOW THE DANNY IN THE IMAGE ANSWERS ....
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Come on, Liz. We'll get eaten alive.
E: on the beach
C: DANNY
D: No ... We'll stay.
E: at the vanity, softly
N: BACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore. The sun sinks completely below the horizon. A long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals. The dying fish breaths its last. Danny (at the vanity) closes his eyes.
T: SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
N: The trumpet goes back in the case. The lid is closed. The case goes back in the box. The neatly folded clothes are laid on top. The box goes back to the shelf. The light in the closet is turned off.
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN.
S: EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT
N: Danny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table. Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. Danny watching silently. Tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it. The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation.
C: DANNY
D: You think I'm a Judas?
C: TANNER
D: Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
C: DANNY
D: Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
C: TANNER
D: Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
N: Danny smiles. TANNER (cont'd) I'm serious. He hates 'em. You ever hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins? Tanner shakes his head and smiles.
C: DANNY
D: Thanks for not judging me.
C: TANNER
D: It's not my place.
C: DANNY
D: Don't you wonder why I do it?
C: TANNER
D: The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
C: DANNY
D: You don't find that repugnant?
C: TANNER
D: Just the way the world works. Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
C: DANNY
D: Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
C: TANNER
D: Bobby laid his own tracks. He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him. Now take the money.
E: beat
N: Danny stuffs the money into his jacket. TANNER (cont'd) One think I do want to know is how the hell did you get yourself into this position to start with? You seem like a smart enough guy.
C: DANNY
D: It's a long story. Maybe I'll tell you all about it some day.
N: Garcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up. DANNY (cont'd) Hey, Garcetti ... You ever get confused and try to flush yourself? Garcetti (all business) You tell him?
C: TANNER
D: I was getting to it.
C: DANNY
D: Tell me what?
E: to Tanner
C: GARCETTI
D: I'll tell him.
C: DANNY
D: Tell me what?
E: worried
N: Garcetti sits down next to Danny. Sighs.
C: GARCETTI
D: Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
E: mock concern
C: DANNY
D: Yeah. What about him?
C: GARCETTI
D: Turns out he's connected.
C: DANNY
D: To who?
C: GARCETTI
D: The Mexicali Boys
C: DANNY
D: And what does this have to do with me?
N: Garcetti puts his hand on Danny's shoulder, really playing it up.
C: GARCETTI
D: He knows somebody ratted him.
C: DANNY
D: What?!
C: GARCETTI
D: And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
N: Garcetti leans in close GARCETTI (cont'd) You know that thing where they slit your throat and pull your tongue out of the hole. Danny knocks Garcetti's hand away and stands up. Garcetti stalks him. GARCETTI (cont'd) Apparently they call it a necktie because it hangs down about yay long and looks very similar to a tie. Isn't that weird, Danny? Isn't that weird?
C: DANNY
D: Shut up, Garcetti!
N: Danny turns to Tanner
C: DANNY
D: If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.

The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside. Danny approaches. The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ... ... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and a rodeo belt. He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man. This is BUBBA. An AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela Anderson-type on the saddle behind him.

C: DANNY
D: I kind of doubt it, Jimmy.
N: The beers arrive. Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp. Danny slides his over.

D: So, why'd you want to see me?
C: DANNY
D: Business. I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
C: JIMMY
D: See that? That's just what I'm talking about.

D: 25 grand. You introduce me to your boy, I'll cut you five grand out of my take. That's all you gotta do, just get me in the door.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Danny walking home. Sparse traffic on the street. He walks with his head down and his hands thrust in his pockets. A RED CAR approaches from the opposite direction. It SLOWS as it passes Danny. Danny looks over. The DRIVER is obscured by the reflected glare of a streetlight, but it is obvious that he is staring right at Danny. Danny plays it cool. Keeps walking. The red car pulls a SLOW U-TURN. Danny hauls ass. The red car catching up. 7Danny runs down a service street which runs through the back of a series of apartment complexes. The red car follows, slowly prowling the street. Danny squeezed behind a dumpster, watching. It is now too dark to see the driver. The car comes to a stop. Danny hugging the dumpster tight.

N: Trashy dude goes to Colette. It looks like he wants to leave and she doesn't. KUJO (cont'd) Danny! Trashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck, lifts her off the stool and pushes her out the front door.
C: DANNY
D: I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on this one, boys.
E: watching Colette
N: Danny watches her exit.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)
N: Danny approaches his door. Stops. Colette is sitting in the hall, head in hands, sobbing. Danny starts to say something. Stops. Goes to this door. Stops again.
C: DANNY
D: You okay? She nods.
N: DANNY (cont'd) Well...good night then. Danny starts to enter again. Stops again. DANNY (cont'd) Why are you out here?
C: COLETTE
D: Quincey, my boyfriend... he kicked me out.
N: Danny isn't quite sure what to do. He takes a half-step towards her.
C: DANNY
D: Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
C: COLETTE
D: I understand. Thanks anyway.
N: She looks up. That face. Those eyes. Everything about her says "Get involved."
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
N: Danny and Colette in a near-deserted retro coffee shop. A LONE WAITRESS AND COOK mull behind the counter. Colette's mascara is running. Danny hands her a napkin.
C: COLETTE
D: Thanks.
N: She dabs at her eyes. COLETTE (cont'd) I'm so embarrassed.
C: DANNY
D: Don't be.
N: She looks at herself in a compact mirror.
C: COLETTE
D: Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
C: DANNY
D: I was thinking Alice Cooper.
N: She puts her head in her hands. Sighs.
C: COLETTE
D: Oh God.
C: DANNY
D: Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
N: She looks up.
C: COLETTE
D: How?
C: DANNY
D: I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
N: She laughs DANNY (cont'd) See. No matter how bad things are, there's always someone a little worse off.
C: COLETTE
D: What about the guy on the very bottom?
C: DANNY
D: Leave me out of this.
C: COLETTE
D: That bad, huh?
N: Danny holds up his water glass.
C: DANNY
D: Nevertheless, I still try to see the glass as half-full.
N: He takes a sip. DANNY (cont'd) Problem is, it's usually half-full of something that tastes a lot like urine. He pulls a face. Sets the glass down.
C: COLETTE
D: Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: Ouch.
N: Colette sips her coffee. Danny looks around nervously. DANNY (cont'd) Hey, did I mention that I was a coward? Colette frowns, not sure what he means. DANNY (cont'd) Quincey. You sure he isn't gonna come looking for you?
C: COLETTE
D: Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
C: DANNY
D: This man sounds like a real catch.
C: COLETTE
D: Oh, he's a keeper all right.
C: DANNY
D: Colette ...
N: He stops.
C: COLETTE
D: What?
C: DANNY
D: Nothing.
C: COLETTE
D: Go ahead.
C: DANNY
D: Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
C: COLETTE
D: It's not that easy.
C: DANNY
D: Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
C: COLETTE
D: Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
E: beat
C: DANNY
D: Then leave.
C: COLETTE
D: I can't.
C: DANNY
D: Why not?
C: COLETTE
D: You don't understand.
C: DANNY
D: There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
C: COLETTE
D: I can't leave.
C: DANNY
D: You get off on abuse or something?
C: COLETTE
D: Fuck you.
C: DANNY
D: Then why don't you leave? Just give me one good reason.
E: beat
C: COLETTE
D: Because he'll kill me.
N: The waitress and cook look up. COLETTE (cont'd) Is that simple enough for you?
C: DANNY
D: Why don't you call the cops?
C: COLETTE
D: Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
C: DANNY
D: That's long enough to get out of town.
C: COLETTE
D: I can't. I've got a kid. She lives with my parents. Quincey knows where they live.
N: Danny chews it over for a second then ...
C: DANNY
D: Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
C: COLETTE
D: How?
N: Danny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved. COLETTE (cont'd) Tell me how.
C: DANNY
D: I don't know. Let me think about it.
E: beat
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Urban blight abounds
S: INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: The grafitti-filled, cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of offices. BUBBA THE ASIAN COWBOY sitting on a desk. Danny pacing back and forth in front of him.
C: BUBBA
D: I wanna do a small buy first. Ten thousand. We'll see how it goes.
E: Texas drawl
C: DANNY
D: Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
C: BUBBA
D: Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
C: DANNY
D: Now that's down-right insulting.
C: BUBBA
D: I'll have to live with that. My money my risk, my rules.
N: Bubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket. Tosses it on the table.
S: EXT. ALLEY - SAME
N: Tanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street. Garcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out building. He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the mike.
C: DANNY
D: I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
E: O.S. filtered, broken
C: BUBBA
D: Get used to it. You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
E: O.S. filtered
N: Garcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner.
C: GARCETTI
D: You thinking what I'm thinking?
C: TANNER
D: Yeah. This could be the one we're looking for.
S: EXT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME
N: Bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner.
S: INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME
N: Danny now alone. He picks up the bundle of cash. Turns to leave when ... Tanner and Garcetti enter the building. Danny turns and runs the other way.
C: TANNER
D: Hold it right there, Flynne.
N: Danny stops.
C: DANNY
D: Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!
N: Danny secretly pockets the bundle of cash.
C: DANNY
D: What the hell are you doing here?
C: TANNER
D: Question is, what are you doing here?
C: DANNY
D: I was trying to score some dope.
C: TANNER
D: Cut the shit, Flynne.
C: DANNY
D: Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
C: TANNER
D: Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
N: Tanner takes out a pair of black leather gloves.
C: DANNY
D: What did I do?!
E: serious
N: Tanner approaches him. Danny backs into a corner. DANNY (cont'd) This is a joke, right? You put him up to this, Garcetti? Garcetti is mum. Tanner raises his fists. Danny covers his face. DANNY (cont'd) Come on Tanner ... don't ... Tanner starts swinging but SOMETHING UNEXPECTED ... TANNER HITS LIKE A WIMP. The punches have absolutely no effect. Danny can't help it. HE STARTS LAUGHING. Tanner throws some more creampuffs. Garcetti shakes his head with shame.
C: TANNER
D: You think this is funny motherfucker?
E: shrieking, failing
C: DANNY
D: I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
E: still laughing and covering up
N: This makes Tanner even madder. His punches become wilder and even less effective.
C: DANNY
D: Garcetti, do something.
N: Garcetti tires of the whole show. He pulls a small SHOCK GUN from his pocket, switches it on and sticks Danny behind the neck with it. Danny crumples to the floor. Tanner kicks him in the face. Garecetti squats down next to Danny.
C: GARCETTI
D: We know what's going on.
C: DANNY
D: I still don't know what you're talking about.
E: in pain
N: Garcetti jams the stun-gun into Danny's crotch. DANNY HOWLS. Garcetti lays off. Danny lays there whimpering.
C: GARCETTI
D: Okay, let me help you. You're setting up a deal with a Chinese redneck. Quarter of a million.
N: Garcetti holds up a tap. GARCETTI (cont'd) We just listened to the whole thing. Danny gaped-mouthed. He can't believe it. GARCETTI (cont'd) Somebody tipped up, dipshit.
C: DANNY
D: Jimmy?
C: GARCETTI
D: Who the hell is Jimmy?
C: DANNY
D: He's the only one I told.
C: GARCETTI
D: And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne. Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
S: INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT (LATER)
N: Danny sitting on a crate. He is sporting a BLACK EYE from where Tanner kicked him. Garcetti at the desk dusting the plastic wrapper on the bundle of cash for prints. Tanner paces back and forth in front of Danny.
C: DANNY
D: I met the guy at a party. He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
C: TANNER
D: This chink have a name?
C: DANNY
D: Bubba.
N: Tanner rolls his eyes. DANNY (cont'd) I swear. That's all he gave me. Hell, I didn't give him my real name either (off their skeptical looks) He figured the less we know about each other, the better.
C: TANNER
D: You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
C: DANNY
D: After that ass-whipping you gave me?
N: Garcetti suppresses a smile.
C: GARCETTI
D: What's on the other end of this thing?
E: finishing up with the bundle
C: DANNY
D: Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
C: GARCETTI
D: Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
C: DANNY
D: Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
C: TANNER
D: What're your taking down?
C: DANNY
D: Standard vig. Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
N: Tanner looks at Danny quizzically.
C: TANNER
D: Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
C: DANNY
D: Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear. I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
N: Danny holds his hands up DANNY (cont'd) But now I've seen the error of my ways. I'll just walk away ... call the whole deal off.
C: GARCETTI
D: Wrong.
N: He tosses the bundle of cash to Danny.
C: DANNY
D: You mean you want me to roll on these guys?
N: Their silence is answer enough. DANNY (cont'd) No. No way. These guys catch a whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini.
C: TANNER
D: You've got no choice.
C: DANNY
D: Whata you mean I've got no choice?
C: TANNER
D: Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
C: DANNY
D: For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
C: TANNER
D: No. You just handed us a new one. We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank. What's the mandatory on that, Al?
C: GARCETTI
D: Dime, minimum.
N: MOVE OFF GARCETTI and over to a wall mounted heating vent. MOVE INTO THE VENT, then ... ... OUT OF A VENT in another room. BUBBA lurking in the shadows. Listening to the conversation through the wall vent in the other room.
C: TANNER
D: And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
E: O.S.
C: GARCETTI
D: That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
E: O.S.
N: Bubba listens intently.
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: Danny hunkered down in the back sea. Garcetti sniffing the air.
C: GARCETTI
D: What's that smell?
C: DANNY
D: That would be me.
C: GARCETTI
D: What'd you do, piss your pants?
C: DANNY
D: Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
N: Garcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile.
C: GARCETTI
D: Who'd have thought it? Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
C: DANNY
D: Lay off, Garcetti. I'm not in the mood.
C: GARCETTI
D: No. You've got me all wrong. I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
C: TANNER
D: Bullshit. He's a liar.
C: DANNY
D: News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
C: TANNER
D: You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
N: The dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship. Tanner is now the bad cop. TANNER (cont'd) Well, you played the wrong mark this time, asshole.
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ... ... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets. Danny ducks into a liquor store and watches from the window. The red car cruises slowly past. Danny squinting, trying to make out ... ... THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER. A street light illuminates the tag momentarily. A VANITY PLATE: IFORGIV. Danny frowns, not sure that to make of it.
S: INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Colette and Quincey lying in bed. THE LILTING SOUND of Danny's trumpet wafting in the air. Quincey is fast asleep. Colette lays there, eyes open, listening to the coolly hypnotic strains of Miles Davis' "Generique."
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME
N: Danny in his good clothes, sitting in front of the mirror, playing his trumpet, staring at the photos of his wife.
S: INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - SAME
N: Colette now sitting on the floor of the adjoining wall with her arms around her knees. She closes her eyes and leans her head against the wall, soaking in the music.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME
N: Danny continues playing. He sneaks down a look at ... ... A GREETING CARD on the vanity in front of him. The word, "CONGRATULATIONS" printed on the front. THE FLASHBACK IMGERY appears on the wall behind him again. MOVE from Danny to the image as we ...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE HIGH DESERT (FLASHBACK)
N: The car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road.
S: INT. CAR - SAME
N: Danny driving. Liz in the passenger seat looking pissed. The Salton Sea can be seen far below in the distance shimmering under a full moon. AGAIN. REMEMBER, DANNY IS KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.
C: LIZ
D: Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
C: LIZ
D: You mean like the Donner Party?
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
C: LIZ
D: Tom, quit fucking around.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Okay, okay. There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
E: peering through the windshield
S: EXT. ROAD - SAME
N: A dilapidated house further up in the hills, lights glowing.
S: INT. CAR - SAME
N: Liz sees the run-down old house.
C: LIZ
D: You think that's a good idea?
C: DANNY/TOM
D: What do you mean?
C: LIZ
D: Look at that place. It's creepy.
N: Danny steers the car onto the narrow dirt approach to the house.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't. Which is it?
C: LIZ
D: I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: Just no pleasing you, is there?
C: LIZ
D: Just admit you're wrong.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?
C: LIZ
D: Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
C: LIZ
D: Here it comes, poor Tom.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician. You have every right.
C: LIZ
D: That is so unfair.
N: Danny stares straight ahead, steering the car towards the house.
C: DANNY/TOM
D: My sentiments exactly.
C: LIZ
D: Why are you doing this?
N: Danny doesn't answer. LIZ (cont'd) I never once asked you to stop playing. I wouldn't dream of it. So don't take your low self-esteem out on me. Danny continues to ignore her.
C: LIZ
D: ... Tom ... screw it. Tell me when you're ready to apologize.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: DANNY lying on the bed, reliving the moment. THE IMAGE STILL PROJECTED
C: ON THE WALL. DANNY
D: I'm sorry, Liz. I love you and I'm sorry.
E: on the bed, whispering
N: But the DANNY IN THE IMAGE never answers.
S: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: It is raining buckets outside. Danny sleeping soundly. The roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS BED. Danny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly. LISTENING TO THE WATER. ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS THE WATER PATTERS AND PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR. IT IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.
S: INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT
N: The bar is almost empty. Danny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back of the room - the through-line of Davis' "All Blues."
C: COLETTE
D: This seat taken?
E: O.S.
N: Danny looks up.
C: DANNY
D: Oh. Hi.
C: COLETTE
D: What happened to your eye?
C: DANNY
D: Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. Where's Quincey?
E: beat off her puzzled look
C: COLETTE
D: Don't worry. He's out of town.
C: DANNY
D: How far out of town?
C: COLETTE
D: Trust me. We're safe.
N: Colette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny. COLETTE (cont'd) Please keep playing. He continues. She sits there listening for a few moments. COLETTE (cont'd) That's nice. What is it?
C: DANNY
D: Miles Davis. "All Blues."
C: COLETTE
D: Never heard of him.
C: DANNY
D: Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
C: COLETTE
D: Like you?
C: DANNY
D: Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
N: Danny continues to play.
C: DANNY
D: Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
C: COLETTE
D: And you admire that?
C: DANNY
D: It's the only way to play.
N: Colette slides closer.
C: COLETTE
D: Is that how you play?
C: DANNY
D: I try.
C: COLETTE
D: No false notes?
N: She pulls even closer.
C: COLETTE
D: No deep dark secrets?
N: She goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her.
C: DANNY
D: : What are you up to?
E: cold and abrupt
C: COLETTE
D: Nothing.
C: DANNY
D: What do you want from me, Colette?
C: COLETTE
D: I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
C: DANNY
D: It gets me through the day.
C: COLETTE
D: You really need to lighten up.
N: She puts her hand on his leg. COLETTE (cont'd) Just relax. He moves his leg away.
C: DANNY
D: Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
C: COLETTE
D: This has nothing to do with him.
C: DANNY
D: So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
C: COLETTE
D: Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
C: DANNY
D: How much time do you have?
C: COLETTE
D: What is wrong with you?
C: DANNY
D: How much time do you have?
C: COLETTE
D: You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
C: DANNY
D: Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
C: COLETTE
D: There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
C: DANNY
D: You don't like the tune, find another station.
C: COLETTE
D: What are you hiding, Danny?
C: DANNY
D: Therapy session is over.
N: He closes the keyboard cover.
C: COLETTE
D: You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
C: DANNY
D: No. But I'm the only one with my sad story. And that's how it's gonna stay.
E: beat
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Still raining. Tanner negotiates the slow traffic. Danny looking at a MUG SHOT OF POOH-BEAR. Garcetti Harlan Dale Monty a.k.a. Pooh-Bear. Did five years manslaughter for beating a pimp to death with an electric wheelchair.
C: DANNY
D: Excuse me?
C: GARCETTI
D: Several possession charges, but nothing major.
C: DANNY
D: Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
C: GARCETTI
D: They have. But they never found a lab.
C: TANNER
D: That's because he doesn't have one.
C: DANNY
D: Whata you mean? He told me -
C: TANNER
D: Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers. As least that's what the word is.
C: DANNY
D: What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
C: TANNER
D: That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
C: GARCETTI
D: You're lucky, Flynne.
C: DANNY
D: Funny, I don't feel lucky.
C: GARCETTI
D: We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
C: DANNY
D: What if he caps me before you can make a move?
C: TANNER
D: Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
C: GARCETTI
D: Don't we always take good care of you?
N: Danny doesn't look reassured.
C: DANNY
D: Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
C: GARCETTI
D: You mean the menacing red car?
N: Garcetti and Tanner exchange a smile.
C: DANNY
D: What? Is it bad?
C: TANNER
D: I'm afraid so, Danny.
C: DANNY
D: Who is it?
C: GARCETTI
D: Brace yourself.
N: Danny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner.
C: DANNY
D: Come on! Who is it? Domingo's boys?
C: GARCETTI
D: Worse. Much worse. A teacher.
E: beat
N: Garcetti and Tanner break out laughing.
C: TANNER
D: Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.
N: Danny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti and Tanner have to say.
C: GARCETTI
D: She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
C: TANNER
D: Now that's scary!
N: Danny lost in thought.
C: GARCETTI
D: You're paranoid, Flynne. I think that crank is finally starting to get the best of you.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Danny waiting on the corner.
C: GARCETTI
D: When is the deal going down?
E: V.O.
C: DANNY
D: I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something. If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
E: V.O.
N: Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny. Jimmy gets out and hands Danny the keys. ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU! Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car, leaving Jimmy with the sign.
C: JIMMY
D: You sure you don't want me to go with you?
N: Danny burns rubber.
S: EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
N: Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little.
S: INT. HOUSE - SAME
N: Pooh-Bear sitting in a recliner, obscured by shadows when Danny and his escorts enter. A WIRE CAGE IN THE CORNER, SOMETHING MOVING AROUND INSIDE. It too is obscured by shadows. Pooh-Bear doesn't look up. He is preoccupied with something in his hand which he is cleaning with a toothbrush.
C: DANNY
D: Pooh-Bear, my man. What's up?
N: Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing.
C: LITTLE BILL
D: He's blue.
C: BIG BILL
D: Comin' down from a 10 day ride.
N: Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear.
C: DANNY
D: You want to do this some other time?
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Pull your pants down.
E: gloomy and tired
C: DANNY
D: I'm sorry?

D: Come on, guys ...
E: laughing nervously
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Big Bill.
N: Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his jacket and points it at Danny's head.
C: BIG BILL
D: Argh, matie. I'm a pirate.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Little Bill
N: Little Bill drops Danny's trousers. Danny about to object when he is started into silence. The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face. He isn't wearing his prosthetic nose. A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD BE. He looks like some obscene human bat. Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it under the light. POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Introduce him to Captain Steubing. He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked. The Bills escort Danny over to the cage. There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED WEASEL INSIDE. The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas. POOH-BEAR (cont'd) You'll have to excuse him, he ain't ate for over a week. The weasel is foaming at the mouth. POOH-BEAR (cont'd) That and the rabies. Don't make for a happy weasel.
C: DANNY
D: Pooh-Bear. come on, man. What is this? It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
E: trying to stay calm off Pooh-Bear's silence
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Big Bill
N: Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist level.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
C: DANNY
D: What?!
N: Pooh-Bear holds up his hand.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Don't address me. I didn't make the accusation.
C: DANNY
D: Please .. I don't know what you're ...
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Uh-uh-uh ...
N: He points to the cage. Danny looks down at the weasel, which is trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas.
C: DANNY
D: Jesus Christ. Um ... I'm not .. Captain Steubing. I'm not working for the cops.
E: to the weasel
N: The weasel continues to gnaw.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: He don't believe you. Big Bill.
C: BIG BILL
D: Drop your package in the cage.
C: DANNY
D: My what?
C: BIG BILL
D: Put your pee-pee through the hole.
N: There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the Plexiglas from Captain Steubing.
C: DANNY
D: This is fucking crazy!
N: Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun.
C: BIG BILL
D: Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
C: DANNY
D: Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ...
N: Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else, is watching the weasel. Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the side. Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Shoot him.
C: DANNY
D: Okay! Okay!
N: From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the cage. DANNY (cont'd) (eyeing the wild rodent) Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ... Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is standing right next to him.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Now get talkin'
C: DANNY
D: I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
N: Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an inch. THE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm through.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: You got something to tell Captain Steubing, you'd better do it now.
N: The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas. Danny uses the diversion. He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between the coat and the lining. No one notices. Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more. The weasel is able to get his head through the hole. He bares his filthy teeth.
C: DANNY
D: Captain Steubing, listen to me. You're after the wrong guy. This is the fuck you should be talking to.
E: rapid-fire
N: He nods towards Little Bill. Pooh-Bear cocks his head. DANNY (cont'd) Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his own stuff on the side.
C: LITTLE BILL
D: That's a pack of discharge.
N: Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently.
C: DANNY
D: It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role at a bar the other night ... said he was dissin' your ass in front of one of your customers.
N: Pooh-Bear rises slowly. Approaches the triumvirate. Danny keeps one eye on ... ... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Man'll say a lot of thing when he's sporting weasel food for a pecker.
C: LITTLE BILL
D: Damn straight.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Least I can do is check it out though.
N: Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband.
C: DANNY
D: Can I pull my dick out now?
N: Pooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill. POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Big Bill Big Bill pats Little Bill down.
C: LITTLE BILL
D: Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
E: holding up his arms
N: Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty. The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole.
C: DANNY
D: Can I pull my dick out?
N: Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat.
C: BIG BILL
D: He's clean.
N: Danny can't believe it. But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big roll of cash protrudes from the hole. Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately.
C: LITTLE BILL
D: What?
N: He follows their gaze to the cash.
C: DANNY
D: CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Yeah.
E: eyes on Little Bill
N: Danny extracts himself from the cage just as ... ... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in the cage.
S: INT. POOH-BEAR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER)
N: Danny sitting at the kitchen table. THE SCREAMS OF LITTLE BILL AUDIBLE FROM THE OTHER ROOM. Danny is FIDDLING WITH SOMETHING UNDER THE TABLE when he HEARS POOH- BEAR APPROACHING. Danny finishes up, stuffing a roll of DUCT TAPE into his pocket. Pooh-Bear drops a zip-lock bag of METH on the table.
C: DANNY
D: I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Don't do that. Please. Or I'll kill you. Please, Danny.
C: DANNY
D: What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
C: POOH-BEAR
D: No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
N: Pooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny. POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Take it easy. You passed. Danny hands over the bundle of cash. Pockets the dope.
C: DANNY
D: Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
C: POOH-BEAR
D: I'll keep that in mind.
N: MOVE UNDER THE TABLE - Danny's Glock taped to the underside, out of sight.
S: EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT
N: Danny, Garcetti and Tanner. Tanner doing a chemical test on the meth with a field kit. The tester turns a tell-tale blue.
C: TANNER
D: We're in business.
C: GARCETTI
D: Good work, Flynne. You're a first-rate rat.
C: DANNY
D: That's real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.
C: TANNER
D: We got the 411 on your good old boy.
N: Tanner produces a print out from an F.B.I criminal computer file. A MUG SHOT OF BUBBA. The name BUFORD "BUBBA" NGUYEN underneath. TANNER (cont'd) Nothing local so we ran his prints through the F.B.I. Believed to be a major supplier in Texas. Jumped bail on a murder rap last April.
C: DANNY
D: Murder. Beautiful.
C: TANNER
D: Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
N: Danny heaves a sign and plops down on a bench.
C: DANNY
D: You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
C: GARCETTI
D: Didn't you hear? Domingo's dead.
N: Danny looks up.
C: TANNER
D: Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
C: DANNY
D: Jesus.
C: TANNER
D: I thought you'd be happy.
C: DANNY
D: Yeah.
N: He doesn't look happy.
S: INT. PRISON - NIGHT
N: Domingo sprawled face-down on the tile floor of the shower room. Blood leaking from underneath him. WATER PATTERS DOWN FROM THE SHOWER HEAD. DILUTING THE POOL OF BLOOD. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.
S: EXT. PALOS VERDES - NIGHT
N: The red car with "IFORGIV" plates parked in the driveway of a modest Spanish-style house.
S: INT. PALSO VERDES - NIGHT
N: NANCY AND VERNE PLUMMER watching TV. Photos of Liz on top of a baby grand piano. A SHRINE OF SORTS. CATHOLIC ICONS ABOUND: crucifixes, Virgin Mary's, needle point prayers. A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Nancy gets up to answer.
C: NANCY
D: Who is it?
C: DANNY
D: It's Tom.
E: O.S.
N: Nancy and Verne look at one another.
S: INT. PALOS VERDES HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Danny and Verne sitting at the dining room table. Nancy brings in a pot of coffee. Verne eyes Danny silently. Danny won't look him in the eye.
C: DANNY
D: All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
C: NANCY
D: Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
N: Nancy pours the coffee. NANCY (cont'd) Billy's a cop now, you know.
C: VERNE
D: Highway Patrol.
C: NANCY
D: He said you were ... the people you Were with ... well ...
C: VERNE
D: Said you were a drug addict.
C: DANNY
D: Maybe I should just go.
N: Danny pushes away from the table. Nancy grabs Danny's wrist.
C: NANCY
D: No. We want to help you, Tom.
N: Danny stays put. NANCY (cont'd) I know everyone deals with grief in their own way. I know how hard it is to find closure.
C: DANNY
D: Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
C: NANCY
D: I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
C: DANNY
D: Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
C: NANCY
D: You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
C: DANNY
D: Maybe I am dealing with it.
C: NANCY
D: I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
N: Danny looks at the shrine to Liz on top of the piano.
C: DANNY
D: Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
C: VERNE
D: That was my idea.
C: DANNY
D: You never did like me much, did you Verne? And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
E: beat
N: Verne's silence is answer enough. DANNY (cont'd) I don't blame you for hating me. At least I understand that. (back to Nancy) But forgiving the butchers who killed Liz well I'm having some trouble with that one.
C: NANCY
D: Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, a persecute you.
N: Danny touches Nancy's hand tenderly.
C: DANNY
D: I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz. No one can. And you can't forgive for me.
C: NANCY
D: Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
C: DANNY
D: I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred. Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her. Do you know what that feels like?
E: beat
C: NANCY
D: It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
C: DANNY
D: How?
N: Verne slams his hand down on the table.
C: VERNE
D: By not disgracing her memory!
C: DANNY
D: What does that mean?
C: VERNE
D: You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose. Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
N: Verne glares at Danny. No forgiveness in his heart. VERNE (cont'd) You ever think you might be buying drugs from the very people who took her life?
C: DANNY
D: You don't understand.
C: VERNE
D: Understand what?
N: Danny starts to say something. Stops.
C: DANNY
D: Nothing. It's ... it's complicated. I just want you to know ... I'm not what you think I am.

N: Colette goes to touch him. He pulls away. DANNY (cont'd) I can't.
C: COLETTE
D: Why not?
C: DANNY
D: I just can't. Okay?
N: Danny paces uncomfortably.
C: COLETTE
D: What's wrong, Danny?
C: DANNY
D: Look, maybe you oughta' leave.

N: Colette comes to a slow realization.
C: COLETTE
D: There's someone else, isn't there?
N: THE FLASHBACK IMAGERY suddenly FLICKERS TO LIFE on the wall behind Danny - THE MOONLIGH SALTON SEA. Danny freezes. Looks up at Colette.
C: DANNY
D: Yes.
N: Colette waits a beat, then turns to leave. DANNY (cont'd) Don't go. (beat) Please, Colette. (she stops) Stay and talk to me, please. Something about Danny's voice - a raw vulnerability - which we haven't seen in him before. MOVE OFF of Danny and ONTO THE FLASHBACK IMAGE.

S: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
N: Danny peeing WHEN HE HEARS ANOTHER CAR PULL UP OUTSIDE. CAR DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE. HUSHED VOICES OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM WINDOW. Danny finishes up. He steps up onto the tub and peaks out the bathroom window. THROUGH THE WINDOW - TWO FIGURES CROSS IN FRONT OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CAR. THE ENGINE REMAINS RUNNING. Danny frowns, not sure what to make of it. He steps down from the tub and is just about to exit when THE FRONT DOORS IS KICKED OPEN AND SHOTS ARE FIRED. VOICES SHOUTING. Danny freezes, not sure what to do. His eyes dart around for a weapon. He picks up a large plumber's wrench and goes to the bathroom door. MORE SHOTS. SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIRE. SEVERAL BULLETS slam through the bathroom wall, one striking Danny in the shoulder. He slumps to the floor. THE PANDEMONIUM continues in the front room. There is a BULLET HOLE about the size of a fifty cent piece in the wall next to Danny's head. He puts his eye to the hole and looks out. DANNY'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning the room. Stopping on ... ... LIZ. In the confusion, she has managed to hide from the intruders. She is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall. She clings tightly to the curtains, her hands shaking violently. ONE THE CURTAIN RINGS - pulled taught by Liz's grip. Danny adjusts his gaze through the hole. THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning to the other side of the room. Bo and the other guy sprawled on the floor. INTRUDER ONE stands over them, only his legs visible. BACK ON LIZ - scared to death, clinging to the curtains. The curtain rings are pulled to the breaking point.
C: INTRUDER ONE
D: Let's go!
N: INTRUDER TWO emerges from the back carrying a small nylon bag. They start to head out the front door when ... ... one of the curtain rings breaks with a METALLIC "TING". ON DANNY - freaking. His eyes shooting back to Liz. SILENCE. Listening. Then the CREAKING FOOTSTEPS of Intruder One approaching. It takes an eternity. Liz can't possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is staring directly at him, her body rigid with fear. Danny grabs the wrench again. Tries to get to his feet but slips back down, either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared. His hand is shaking violently. He looks through the hole again. THROUGH THE HOLE - Liz still staring at Danny. THE FOOTSTEPS CONTENCE at a agonizing slow pace, then stop. A GUN, ever so slowly, enters FRAME. EXTREME CLOSE UP on Liz's eyes as they widen. EXTREME CLOSE UP on Danny's eye peering through the hole. A SHOT IS FIRED. His eye closes. ON DANNY-his mouth opens to scream BUT NOTHING COMES OUT. And with that it is all over. Danny tries to get to his feet again. Fails, His eyes flutter. All is silent except for A FAINT LIQUID SPATTERING. LONG SHOT-Back on the Salton Sea, placid and silvered with moonlight.

D: Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
C: COLETTE
D: I don't want to.
N: Danny stalks her.
C: DANNY
D: I'm offering you the chance to take care of your problems. Take it. Don't make the same mistake I did, Colette. Do something while you have a chance.

E: she still hesitates beat firm
N: DANNY (cont'd) Tommorrow night, when he is asleep. I want you to beep me at this number. He writes the number down on a dollar bill.

D: Why?
C: DANNY
D: Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.

C: DANNY
D: Just do it. All your problems with Quincey will be taken care of.

D: This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
C: DANNY
D: You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
N: Jimmy slack-jawed. DANNY (cont'd) You asked me how I always keep my shit together. Well, that's how.
C: JIMMY
D: No one ever noticed?
C: DANNY
D: Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.

N: Big Bill is behind Danny, over by the sink. He pulls his FLINTLOCK and walks over. Danny continues trying to get the gun loose. Something catches his eye ... the MICROWAVE OVEN DOOR is open, casting a reflection of the room behind him. Big Bill approaches Danny, pointing the gun at Danny's head. The other men ease back from the table a little. UNDER THE TABLE - Danny still can't get the gun loose. ON THE REFLECTION - Big Bill right behind Danny. He raises the flintlock. Danny bugging. He rips at the gun. Too late. Big Bill goes to fire. Using the reflection, Danny ducks at the last instant. Big Bill FIRES. The guy across the table takes the mini-ball in the chest. ALL IN AN INSTANT - Danny extricates the gun. Turns on Big Bill, who sees the gun and holds his hands up. Danny SHOOTS TWICE, the bullets blowing through Big Bill's hands and thumping into his chest. Big Bill crumples. When Pooh-Bear goes to pull his gun from his waist-band, it discharges, shooting him in the thigh. The muzzle flash ignites his pants leg. POOH-BEAR HITS THE FLOOR, SCREAMING, slapping at the fire on his leg. Danny wheels on the other two guys at the table, who are going for their guns. Danny opens up on them with the Glock, flooring them before they can get a shot off. OUTSIDE - still descending the bluff, Tanner and Garcetti hear the gunfire. INSIDE - Danny turns on Pooh-Bear, who sits there staring at his injured leg. Danny puts the gun to Pooh-Bear's head, closes his eyes and starts to pull the trigger. Pooh-Bear lifts his gun and SHOOTS DANNY IN THE TORSO THREE TIMES. Danny collapses. Pooh-Bear gets to his feet.
C: POOH-BEAR
D: Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy. Pooh- Bear done shot himself.

They pull their ski-masks on, take out their guns, then silently enter. INSIDE - gunsmoke abounds. One of the guys MOANS on the floor. Tanner and Garcetti enter the kitchen, guns drawn and ready. They survey the scene. Bodies everywhere. Big Bill lays there dying, staring with confusion at the stigmata in his hands. Danny lying in a heap, next to Big Bill. Suddenly, they hear POOH-BEAR MUMBLING from somewhere in the house. Tanner signals for Garcetti to take point. They head down the long hallway, slowly and silently. When they are gone ... ... Danny stirs on the floor. His eyes open. He opens his shirt and checks his torso REVEALING THAT HE IS WEARING HIS BULLET-PROOF VEST. He struggles to a sitting position, in great pain from the impact bruises left by the bullets. He picks up his gun, gets up on wobbly legs and follows Tanner and Garcetti down the hall.

She looks fine. There is even a slight smile on her lips. DANNY (cont'd) Liz? Then he notices it ... ... a widening pool of BLOOD seeps from under the couch like some living thing. More blood patters down from some UNSEEN WOUND on the side of her head. Danny staggers towards her. Her eyes flutter slightly. Danny sits next to her. Holds her hand. There is nothing he can do.

He draws the meth into a syringe then turns on the stereo with a remote. A YODELING INSTRUCTION TAPE BLASTS FROM THE SPEAKERS. Pooh-Bear prepares to dose, looking for a vein in his neck, never noticing ... ... Garcetti's gun moving to the back of Pooh-Bear's head. Pooh-Bear about to plunge the drugs when GARCETTI FIRES.

N: Garcetti holsters his weapon and picks up the bag of money from the floor. GARCETTI (cont'd) Let's get out of here. A GUNSHOT. Garcetti goes down where he stands. He lays there twitching like a rabbit. Tanner staring down the sucker's end of Danny's gun.

N: Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder. He collapses to the floor. ON GARCETTI - his eyes flutter and open. Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him. DANNY (cont'd) ... there's two guys with masks and guns in the other room about to kill your wife. Tanner looks at Danny, confused. DANNY (cont'd) But you know if you go out there, they'll kill you, too. You'll both die. What do you do? Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about. DANNY (cont'd) Do you go out there and die like a man or do you live to fight another day? Tanner doesn't answer. Danny (cont'd) What do you do? Still no answer. DANNY (cont'd) Answer the question! Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly. Danny (cont'd) What do you do!
C: TANNER
D: Please ... don't do this ...
C: DANNY
D: Answer the fucking question!
N: When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again ... ... Tanner pulls a K-BAR KNIFE from the back of his belt and plunges it into the back of Danny's gun hand. The gun discharges, missing Tanner. Danny drops the gun. Tanner snatches it up. Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head. Danny freezes
C: TANNER
D: Does that answer your question? I fight. I fight and I die like a man. You're a fucking coward, Flynne. You lived like one and now you're gonna die like one.

N: ON DANNY. Still staring at the gun. He knows the gun is empty. He notices something on the floor ... ... THE LOADED SYRINGE. KID (cont'd) Or did I say ELEVEN? Danny trying to remember. KID (cont'd) Which was it, mister? Was it ten or was it eleven? (beat) Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me. DANNY starts chuckling. Looks up at Tanner.
C: DANNY
D: It doesn't matter.
N: Danny looks down at the syringe again. Tanner sees it too.
C: TANNER
D: Too late to be a hero.
N: Danny picks up the syringe. Tanner pulls the trigger. INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK.
C: THE GUN IS EMPTY. DANNY
D: Ten it is.
N: Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNER'S THROAT all the way down to the plunger, dosing him with the meth. Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe. His eyes roll back as he convulses from the drugs. Danny struggles to his feet. Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in the throws of a holy possession. Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat. A LONG WET WEEZE ESCAPES. Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY. Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone. He looks brain dead. Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING. Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't. He keeps looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey. Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti. Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood. He looks down at his hand. He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with. Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny. TANNER'S WHEEZING CONTINUES.
C: DANNY
D: You're dead.
E: softly
N: Garcetti nods slightly. He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies. Danny goes over to the couch and sits down. Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted. TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER. CLOSE ON DANNY'S FACE. Blank. Devoid of anything. He stuffs Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking. He takes the gun out. Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it. The barrel clatters against his teeth. He takes it out again. THE WHEEZING CONTINUES. Danny starts crying. Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it. He jumps up. Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his clip into him. When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger ... over and over again. He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and again.

N: The fire continues to spread. Colette kisses Danny on the lips. Quincey pulls her away. Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door,
T: cutting off any escape.
N: Danny breathing hard. He gets up. Staggers over to the mirror where his trumpet is. He opens the case and takes the trumpet out. He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, a smile on his lips. He starts to play SAETA.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Back to the opening scene. The whole room ablaze. Danny lying on the bed, playing the horn.
C: DANNY
D: So what is it? Who am I after it's all said and done?
E: V.O.
N: Pieces of the roof start falling in. DANNY (cont'd) Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne? (beat) Avenging angel or plain old Judas? He stops playing. DANNY (cont'd) (weakly) You decide, friend. You decide. He closes his eyes. DANNY (cont'd) I'm too tired ... so you decide. He drops his trumpet and lays his head back.
T: CUT TO:
N: BLACK SCREEN THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames. CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.
C: DANNY
D: Oh shit. What is this?
E: V.O.
N: Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway. Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float. DANNY (cont'd) Am I dead? A linoleum floor rushes underneath. DANNY (cont'd) Linoleum. This must be hell. Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ... ... A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF. The tattoo smiles and speaks.
C: TATTO
D: Hang in there buddy.
E: warped, distorted
N: Stairs rush by underneath. Then another hallway. DANNY'S P.O.V. - a bright white light at the end of the hall. DANNY (cont'd) Oh no. What a fucking cliché. On Danny's face, floating through the hall. His eyes fluttering. MOVING TOWARDS the light. Closer. Closer. Danny's eyes close, his head droops.
T: FADE TO WHITE:
N: CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open. DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ... ... JIMMY staring down at him with concern. Danny blinks his eyes again. Looks up at ... ... A PARAMEDIC working on him. Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy. Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his face. The paramedic continues to work on Danny. His eyes slowly close.
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN:
S: EXT. THE CITY - DAY
N: Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop. He looks like a new man.
C: DANNY
D: Well, I've had some time to think about it and it's pretty simple after all. I guess it's like the man said - "Man is the measure of all things." I should know. I ran the gamut. Avenging Angel, Judas, loving husband, prodigal son, prince of Denmark. I was all of those things. Tom Van Allen got his revenge. Good for Tom. And Danny Flynne? He got gut-shot for being the low-life rat that he was. Sucks for him. But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.
E: V.O. beat beat
N: Danny looks through the window of the shop. Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee. DANNY (cont'd) But what about this guy? Who is he? Danny enters the shop. DANNY (cont'd) To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.
S: INT. COFFE SHOP - SAME
N: Danny takes a seat at the counter. Colette turns and sees him. DANNY (cont'd) But I like his chances. They stare at one another for a beat, then smile. Colette pours him some coffee. DANNY (cont'd) I really like his chances. They strike up a conversation as we ...
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
