D: August 6, 2009
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. SUV -- DAY
N: No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA, unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read: THE LAST THREE YEARS
S: INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd. LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing. Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.
C: LARA
D: You know what? If you were smart you would stop talking right now.
C: ERIT
D: Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women.
N: John laughs and applauds. Mick buries his head.
C: LARA
D: How can you say that??
C: ERIT
D: They're always threatened. Especially if you're beautiful and they're not.
C: LARA
D: Erit, you are so full of shit.
C: ERIT
D: So, your boss isn't threatened by you?
C: LARA
D: Because she's a bitch! -- --Not because she's a woman.
E: as John and Mick laugh
C: ERIT
D: And you would describe her as "attractive"?
C: LARA
D: That has nothing to do with it!
C: ERIT
D: And there is my answer.
C: JOHN
D: Either of you like another drink?
N: Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.
C: ERIT
D: Women should work under men, men under women. That's it.
C: JOHN
D: But men under men?
E: egging her on
C: ERIT
D: That's fine, too. They're used to it! Why are you laughing?
E: the men burst into laughter
C: MICK
D: I don't know, bro, but I think I'd rather work under you than her.
E: re: Erit
C: ERIT
D: Oh please, I'd rather work under him, too.
E: insulted, shoots back
N: That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.
C: LARA
D: You'd rather "work under" John?
C: ERIT
D: You have a problem with that, too?
C: LARA
D: No, why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?
C: ERIT
D: What is up your ass tonight??
N: Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.
C: LARA
D: So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.
C: ERIT
D: Lara, if I wanted your husband I would have him.
E: claws out now
C: LARA
D: How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.
N: The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.
C: ERIT
D: -- You know what your problem is?!
C: JOHN MICK
D: That was a great meal! Okay--okay!
S: EXT. STEAK HOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
N: Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup. John and Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.
C: JOHN
D: She is completely full of shit.
C: LARA
D: DON'T try and agree with me now.
C: JOHN
D: You know what? I don't even believe she is in the dental profession.
N: Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.
C: LARA
D: Shut up.
C: JOHN
D: I bet she can't even spell anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete fraud.
C: LARA
D: We went to her office party, idiot.
C: JOHN
D: I think she hit on me that night, too.
N: Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....
C: LARA
D: You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her.
C: JOHN
D: I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.
N: She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it away.
C: LARA
D: You are such an asshole.
C: JOHN
D: You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your--
N: She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.
C: JOHN
D: Someone's going to --
E: CONT'D
N: Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him. After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors. She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT
N: Lara and John enter, Lara carrying her raincoat, her hair sticking up in the back, John's shirt untucked. WHITE 9-10-09 5.
C: LARA
D: Hello!
N: JENNA, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them.
C: LARA
D: Did he cry?
E: CONT'D
C: JENNA
D: Only when I dropped him down the stairs.
N: Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
N: She peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER
N: Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna. John nods for her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.
C: JOHN
D: Thanks. See you next weekend.
N: Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out. John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again. He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.
S: INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: Lara wakes, troubled. It's the middle of the night.
S: INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
N: Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked. She locks it and looks out. Satisfied, she sits and watches her son sleep.
S: INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
N: Three year-old LUKE holds a knife and fork as he sits at the table watching his dad cut up his pancakes.
C: JOHN
D: Okay, your turn.
N: Luke skewers a piece with his fork. Lara passes, hustling to get to work.
C: JOHN
D: Very good, very good...
E: CONT'D
N: Luke puts it in his mouth.
C: JOHN
D: No, no, no; you feed me. Your son is hopeless.
E: CONT'D to Lara
N: Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo.
C: LARA
D: Squeeze in tight.
C: JOHN
D: You can't do this every morning. It is way too corny.
C: LARA
D: Smile. It's just until he's eighteen.
N: It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go.
C: LARA
D: Present.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Sweetie, you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue.
E: examining it
C: LARA
D: You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes them in thirty seconds.
C: JOHN
D: I love brushing my teeth. The lies your mother tells.
E: as if stung to Luke
C: LARA
D: When's your last class?
E: ignoring him
C: JOHN
D: Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?
C: LARA
D: After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?
C: JOHN
D: Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.
C: LARA
D: Did you call your father?
E: pulls note off fridge
C: JOHN
D: When?
C: LARA
D: "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!
E: heading for bathroom
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM
N: Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin.
C: JOHN
D: I sent him flowers and a handmade card.
E: O.S.
C: LARA
D: You're completely impossible.
C: JOHN
D: Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? A grunt.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN
C: JOHN
D: Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up.
N: Lara returns, trying hard not to smile.
C: LARA
D: Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here?
C: JOHN
D: Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.
E: to Luke
C: LARA
D: How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you?
N: Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer.
C: JOHN
D: Now she's driving a wedge between us.
C: LARA
D: I give up.
C: JOHN
D: And now she is abandoning you.
N: Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM
N: Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN
N: John rises to answer the door.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM
N: Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER
N: As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge. DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John has no time to react.
C: DETECTIVE QUINN
D: Police. Mr. Brennan?
N: LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared.
C: DETECTIVE QUINN
D: My name is Detective Quinn. This is a search warrant for these premises.
E: CONT'D
N: John hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside.
C: DETECTIVE QUINN
D: Stay where you are.
E: CONT'D stops him
C: JOHN
D: Get your --
C: DETECTIVE QUINN
D: Touch me again and you'll be arrested.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWN THE HALL
N: Lara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero. She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member, who takes it and bags it under:
C: DETECTIVE COLLERO
D: Lara Brennan?
C: LARA
D: WHAT?!
C: DETECTIVE COLLERO
D: Lara Brennan, you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.
N: She takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her.
C: LARA
D: She's dead?? Elizabeth is dead??
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER
C: JOHN
D: She didn't do anything!
E: tries to push past
C: DETECTIVE QUINN
D: I will only --
C: JOHN
D: She didn't do anything!
E: tries again
C: DETECTIVE QUINN
D: Put him in cuffs.
N: The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his wrists. John watches as his child cries, his wife is led out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart. Cut to BLACK.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
C: LUKE
D: Daddy!... DADDY!!
E: O.S.
N: A light comes on. John steps out of his bedroom and enters his son's room.
C: JOHN
D: It's okay. Just a bad dream.
E: O.S.
N: He comes back out carrying Luke, now SIX YEARS-OLD.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him.
C: JOHN
D: You okay?
N: Luke nods.
C: JOHN
D: Okay, you can sleep here as long as you stay on this side of the bed.
E: CONT'D
N: Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side.
C: JOHN
D: You're such a snake, I don't know why I keep falling for the same trick.
E: CONT'D
N: John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow. John reaches for the lamp. Beside it sits the framed photo that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning. He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes BLACK.
S: EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY
N: The "T," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from underground and we CRANE UP to see the city.
C: JOHN
D: But Sam's your friend, right?
E: O.S.
S: EXT. ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL -- DAY
N: Tilt down from a passing T-Train to find John and Luke, walking toward the huge, modern Allegheny County Jail.
C: LUKE

C: JOHN
D: Does he take your food?
C: LUKE
D: No.
C: JOHN
D: Did he say something mean? About Mommy?
E: Luke nods
C: LUKE
D: Yeah.
C: JOHN
D: Did you hit him?
C: LUKE
D: Yeah.
C: JOHN
D: Good. Where did you hit him?
C: LUKE
D: Near the swings.
C: JOHN
D: Wow. I bet that hurt.
C: LUKE
D: Yeah.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY
N: - John waits in a long line, mostly women. He glances over at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and sees children playing. Luke plays by himself. - John puts his key ring in a plastic container. The guard takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings. John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks through and the buzzer goes off. John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something from his pocket, looks at it curiously.
C: JOHN
D: It's a toy!
N: The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech. The guard waves John through. No beep. John kneels and pulls on Luke's jacket.
C: JOHN
D: Don't worry. We'll get it back.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY
N: They walk along the hall with all the other visitors.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY
N: John stares out the window at the city beyond. Life seems so close. He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos. The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter. Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke, who plays with his back to her.
C: LARA
D: Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss? Come on, give Mommy a kiss.
E: no response. Tickles him
C: JOHN
D: Rat-Bag. Give Mommy a kiss.
N: He gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his Legos.
C: LARA
D: Is Daddy reading you my letters?
C: JOHN
D: Every night at bedtime.
C: LARA
D: What are you building? A fort?
N: Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand.
C: LARA
D: Was he scared going to school?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave.
C: LARA
D: What did you make him for lunch?
C: JOHN
D: Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no "vegetables" on it. He swore he ate his apple.
N: He hands her a pack of photos. Lara devours them.
C: LARA
D: Look at his friends. And his desk. This is his teacher?
C: JOHN
D: Miss Phillips.
C: LARA
D: You may have to move to another school district.
C: JOHN
D: Already spoke to a realtor.
C: LARA
D: How was your first day?
E: still looking at photos
C: JOHN
D: Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom.
C: LARA
D: When is she coming?
C: JOHN
D: She's having a lot of trouble with her business.
C: LARA
D: It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it. Have you heard anything?
E: beat
C: JOHN
D: About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say?
C: LARA
D: --Don't--
C: JOHN
D: -- It can take months for the court to rule.
C: LARA
D: I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared.
C: JOHN
D: Meyer's looking for a new investigator.
C: LARA
D: Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it.
C: JOHN
D: He'll go through all the evidence again.
C: LARA
D: Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet.
C: JOHN
D: We're doing fine.
C: LARA
D: You just lie and lie. But you are very handsome. Can you do me a favor?
E: fondly strokes his face admiring him
C: JOHN
D: I don't know, I'm a little busy.
C: LARA
D: I need you to run for governor.
C: JOHN
D: -- Oh, that I can do.
C: LARA
D: You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years.
N: She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place. He reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back.
C: LARA
D: I'm okay. I'm okay.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise.
N: She just stares at Luke, his back to them, playing.
C: LARA
D: You think he'll ever want to kiss me again?
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER
N: The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
N: Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump- suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.
S: INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT
N: Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the toilet, staring at his watch.
C: JOHN
D: Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
N: Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror.
C: JOHN
D: Good?
E: CONT'D
N: Luke nods.
S: EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING
N: The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it. John backs out, Luke in his child seat. He brakes and finds PAULA, the woman who lives behind them, at his window.
C: PAULA
D: How's Lara?
C: JOHN
D: She's doing okay.
C: PAULA
D: Tell her we're pulling for her.
C: JOHN
D: I will.
N: She holds up a plastic water bottle.
C: PAULA
D: They won't recycle these unless you take off the cap. This is trash. This is recyclable.
E: cap vs. bottle
C: JOHN
D: Ok. Thanks.
N: John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in.
S: EXT. PARK -- DAY
N: Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.
C: JOHN
D: Luke! Let's go, Toad. Come on.
N: Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.
C: NICOLE
D: Time to go, Carrie!
N: John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand, arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who heads to retrieve her daughter. John walks off with Luke.
S: INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY
N: John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out with a young associate. He spots John and approaches.
C: MEYER
D: John, I said my office at four o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --
C: JOHN
D: I figured you had to eat.
E: holds up a Subway bag
N: Meyer relents, turns and calls to his associate.
C: MEYER
D: Do you have the ruling in Brennan?
N: She kneels and digs through her rolling briefcase.
S: INT. COURTROOM -- A SHORT TIME LATER
N: John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the ruling. The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at his desk. During this he gets up and walks out past them.
C: JOHN
D: But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?
C: MEYER
D: The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore.
C: JOHN
D: It was a robbery! Someone stole her purse!
C: MEYER
D: And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really...sucks.
N: John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words.
C: JOHN
D: So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court.
C: MEYER
D: John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.
C: JOHN
D: So, I need to find an indecent one?
C: MEYER
D: No, I'm going to file it. But I need you to do something for me.
C: JOHN
D: Anything.
C: MEYER
D: I need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife.
C: JOHN
D: I've seen the evidence, Meyer.
E: stopped by that
C: MEYER
D: I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it. He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon--
C: JOHN
D: We went out for dinner! How do you do that after you kill somebody? She would have to be a psychopath!
E: is this a bad joke?
C: MEYER
D: -- And the fight in the office.
C: JOHN
D: Everyone fights with their boss!
C: MEYER
D: But this one ended up dead.
N: John looks at Meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed.
C: JOHN
D: So, you never believed she was innocent?
C: MEYER
D: How can you say that?
C: JOHN
D: So, what are you saying, Meyer?!
C: MEYER
D: That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that.
C: JOHN
D: I'll find someone to file the pleadings.
E: exiting
C: MEYER
D: John! Come on! For Christ's sake. JOHN!!
N: John is long gone. Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- DAY
N: John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him. John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably. John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder -- desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it. He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention of the guard on his side. Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but she can't hear it, and neither can we.
S: EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY
N: We're in an old working class neighborhood. John sits in his car, trying to pull himself together.
S: INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY
N: MICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door. In the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away, uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention.
S: EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- LATE AFTERNOON
N: John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John:
C: ERIT
D: I know you won't want to hear this...
C: MICK
D: -- Erit, go put somebody to sleep.
N: She stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff.
C: JOHN
D: Thanks.
C: MICK
D: Had to be done. I am really going to pay for that.
E: long beat
N: John has to smile.
S: EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT (DUSK)
N: John drives through a rough part of town on their way home. He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID. He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and photographs. As John sifts through the evidence...
S: INT. LARA'S OFFICE - THE PAST -- NIGHT
N: Lara and her boss ELIZABETH argue loudly.
S: EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT
N: It's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She turns toward camera -- A FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible impact and ELIZABETH collapses to the floor.
S: EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT
N: Lara turns, holding the fire extinguisher.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

C: DUTY NURSE
D: She can't have visitors.
E: finds name in roster
C: JOHN
D: That's ridiculous; I have to see her.
C: DUTY NURSE
D: I'm sorry.
N: John turns away and heads down the corridor to find her himself. The Duty Nurse sees this and takes off after him:
C: DUTY NURSE
D: You can't go down there!
E: CONT'D
N: John shoves open a door, moves on to the next.
C: DUTY NURSE
D: You can't be in here!!
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Lara!
N: HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (running up) I got him!
C: JOHN

C: JOHN
D: My wife attempted suicide.
N: HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE Let's go. (hands doctor chart) She's not allowed visitors.
C: JOHN
D: I have to see her!
C: DR. BECSEY
D: Why isn't she in the ER?
N: HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE I'm not asking. Now. She's a transfer from County Jail.
C: JOHN
D: Please. Two minutes.
N: Becsey is not unmoved. He shares a look with the nurse.
S: INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM -- NIGHT
N: DR. Becsey opens the door for John. Note a prison guard standing outside.
C: DR. BECSEY
D: Two minutes.
N: Becsey leaves. A uniformed female prison guard looks up from her magazine and keeps her eyes on John. He looks to his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery. Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little finger, wraps her fingers around it. WHITE 9-10-09 23.
S: EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT
N: John opens the door to let Jenna out; she looks considerably older.
C: JENNA
D: I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending he's asleep.
C: JOHN
D: Don't worry about it.
E: reaching for his wallet
C: JENNA
D: It's okay.
C: JOHN
D: I insist. I kept you out on a school night.
C: JENNA
D: I'm not in school anymore.
N: She offers a sad smile and leaves without the cash.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: Luke lies in the crook of his father's arm, his own arms full of penguins, turtles, a black dog and an opossum. John reads him a letter, the yellow envelope open on the bed.
C: JOHN
D: And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love, Mommy. You gonna give them hugs from her? Should we write her back?
E: beat no response
C: LUKE
D: ...When is she coming home?
C: JOHN
D: Soon honey. Soon.
C: LUKE
D: Can I have a quarter?
E: thinks for a moment, then:
C: JOHN
D: Can you have a quarter?
N: Luke points at the glass coin dish on night stand.
C: JOHN
D: Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend those. They come from the cottage where Mommy and I used to take you when you were a baby.
E: CONT'D
C: LUKE
D: Then can I have them all?
C: JOHN
D: ...Sure.
N: He hands Luke the jar, and hoists up him and his animals.
S: INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
N: Luke sets the coin jar on his nightstand. John tucks him in with his animals, then switches off the lamp. John looks back before closing it and watches Luke lie awake, staring at the jar, lost in confused thoughts of his mother.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT
N: Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher. He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the counter, feeling destroyed and needy. And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue, places it on the counter and moves away. John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room. Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He flings it open...
S: EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her -- finally realizing she was never there. He stands in the middle of the street, now searching for some way to survive.
S: INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY
N: Don Quixote is written on the chalkboard.
C: JOHN
D: So, what is it about? Julie?
C: JULIE
D: That belief in someone's virtue is more important than virtue itself?
C: JOHN
D: No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about?
N: No takers.
C: JOHN
D: It is about how rational thought destroys the soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in it.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY
N: John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each having something to do with prison or prison life. He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at a time and discards each in turn. As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer screen linked to the school system. ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by the school search engine -- many of the items have already been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls." He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY.
S: EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - STREET -- DAY
N: John gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
N: A couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV screen. DAMON hands John a beer and nods toward a table.
C: JOHN
D: It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost.
C: DAMON
D: Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?
C: JOHN
D: You escaped from jail seven times.
N: Damon lights a cigarette. A TOUGH GUY nearby objects.
C: TOUGH GUY
D: No smoking!!
C: DAMON
D: Yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life?
N: Damon takes a deep drag.
C: JOHN
D: Mind if I tape you?
C: DAMON
D: Go for it, it can't be used as evidence. What do you want to know?
N: John sets up the small digital recorder.
C: JOHN
D: How you escaped when no one else could.
C: DAMON
D: Balls and a little luck. No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it.
E: beat
C: JOHN
D: How do you do that?
C: DAMON
D: A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt.
E: MORE
C: DAMON
D: That's when they will make mistakes. But when you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: The tape recorder plays Damon's voice; John tears large sheets of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall.
C: DAMON
D: You have to know where you are going to go and how you are going to get there. You have to know how they plan to catch you, where, and when.
E: O.S.
C: JOHN
D: How the hell do you know that?
E: O.S.
N: He starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker.
C: DAMON
D: You pay off someone who knows. And a lot depends on if the prison is in the country or the city.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: JOHN
D: The city.
N: That came out too quickly. Damon now understands. John sits, silent, knowing he blew it. Damon takes his time.
C: DAMON
D: Where are you from?
C: JOHN
D: ...Pittsburgh.
C: DAMON
D: Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: The art paper bunches and rips under the pressure of the marker. John tears it off the wall.
C: DAMON
D: From the time they make the call, the police can have the center of the city sealed tight in fifteen minutes.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: JOHN
D: How can they be so exact?
C: DAMON
D: After 9-11 Homeland Security made every city have a lock-down plan -- downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis -- fifteen minutes. They can do DC in under ten.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John draws a circle on the wall and writes in it: 15 MINUTES --
C: DAMON
D: Within thirty-five minutes they will have cops at every tollbooth on the interstate --
E: O.S.
N: -- Surrounds it by a larger circle: 35 MINUTES.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: DAMON
D: And be running rolling stops on the secondary roads. They won't have your photograph yet, but they will have your description.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: He draws spokes out from the circles.
C: JOHN
D: What if you can't make it out?
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: JOHN
D: Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of time.
C: DAMON
D: Then surrender.
E: MORE
C: DAMON
D: Because they will shoot you on sight, along with anyone you are with.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John writes DESCRIPTION at the end of one spoke.
C: DAMON
D: Stay far away from the train and bus stations.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: DAMON
D: Forget the local airports. Leave from another state.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John scribbles key words on the wall. DISTANT AIRPORT.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: DAMON
D: Second: identity. It's easy to find fake papers, harder to find ones that will get you through an airport.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John writes "IDENTITIES."
C: DAMON
D: You'll need a passport, driver's license and a social security number.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: DAMON
D: If you have to rent a car, find a place that will take a cash deposit. They'll still run a credit check, so use a real person's name on the ID. Third: destination.
E: beat
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John writes furiously on the wall. "DESTINATION."
C: DAMON
D: You want somewhere that doesn't attract American tourists and doesn't get American newspapers. Think Yemen and you get the idea.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: DAMON
D: Then money.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John's writes "MONEY."
C: DAMON
D: You need a truck load of it. Everything's expensive: hotels, travel, information.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: JOHN
D: How much?
C: DAMON
D: Enough to last at least five-six years. Run out of money and you run out of friends.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John underlines "MONEY."
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
N: John is starting to understand the enormity of this undertaking.
C: DAMON
D: But before you do anything, you have to ask yourself if you can do it. Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door? Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become. And if you can't, don't start, because you'll just get someone killed.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John backs away from the wall to see it covered in a spiderweb of notes.
C: JOHN
D: How did you get caught?
E: O.S.
S: INT. BAR -- DAY
C: DAMON
D: I gave myself up. I couldn't take wondering when someone was going to come through the bedroom door. Got what you need?
E: beat
C: JOHN
D: Yeah.
C: DAMON
D: What do you have in your pocket?
N: John opens his billfold. Damon takes the cash, leaves him a twenty.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: On the wall we see the massive diagram John has created. The screen goes BLACK. Read: THE LAST THREE MONTHS

S: INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS
N: John rides, looking down at the river below.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY

S: EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DELIVERY AREA -- DAY
N: John sits in his car on the road above, surreptitiously taking pictures of the vehicles coming and going from the prison.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: He tapes the photos to the wall.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL -- DAY
N: Walking down a corridor with the other visitors, John steps in a puddle of water. Behind him the others notice and step around it. Moving on, they pass a trustee on a ladder pulling a water-stained ceiling tile away as two guards watch.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John traces a route on a map with a highlighter.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY (NEW DAY)
N: The wall grows thick with photos and notes.
S: INT. CLASSROOM -- NEW DAY
N: He reads an article on his computer -- about illegal aliens and fake ID's.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John enters his bedroom and closes the door. We see how dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch is covered in notes, photos, maps, and various writings. He studies it as he bites into a sandwich.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY
N: John and Luke walk near the front of the group of visitors toward the visitation rooms. Just ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the elevator. John stops near the elevator and kneels, pulling one of Luke's shoelaces loose.
C: LUKE
D: It was already tied.
N: John reties the lace as the group moves on. He keeps one eye on the elevator. The door opens and the guard steps in - and John notices two WORKMEN in hardhats inside. The elevator closes, the shoelace is tied, the group has moved on down the hall and they are alone. John pulls the laces and unties Luke's shoe.
C: LUKE
D: You untied it again!
E: CONT'D
N: The guard looks back, now impatient. John offers a smile and throws a look down at the elevator tread, sees the name: OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY. Suddenly a voice comes from behind:
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Mr. Brennan?
N: Startled, John turns to see DR. LIFSON.
C: DR. LIFSON
D: We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, sorry. Hello, Doctor.
C: DR. LIFSON
D: I'll bring them back myself.
E: to approaching guard
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CLINIC -- DAY
N: John leaves Luke playing and steps into the office. Lifson partially closes the door, so John can still see his son.
C: DR. LIFSON
D: We check your wife's blood regularly. She's been refusing her insulin. I don't want to sound dramatic, but it's just another form of suicide.
C: JOHN
D: I'll talk to her.
C: DR. LIFSON
D: If she doesn't --
C: JOHN
D: I'll talk to her. Let's go, Squirrel.
E: steps out
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY
N: John and Luke wait. The prisoners enter. Lara looks terrible. John stands and embraces her.
C: JOHN
D: Hey. Are you alright?
C: LARA
D: I'm fine. I'm fine.
N: Lara smiles to cover and bends down and kisses her son, who is engrossed in his toys as usual.
C: LARA
D: Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?
E: CONT'D
N: He doesn't respond. She kisses him on the head then takes a seat. John sits beside her. They speak in whispers.
C: JOHN
D: The doctor told me about the insulin.
C: LARA
D: Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.
E: watching Luke
C: JOHN
D: You forgot? For how many days?
C: LARA
D: I forgot, okay? I have things on my mind.
C: JOHN
D: --And so much to do.
C: LARA
D: Oh, that's nice.
C: JOHN
D: Why are you doing this?
C: LARA
D: Can I please just watch him play? Tell me about kindergarten.
C: JOHN
D: No. I need you to --
C: LARA
D: Fine, I won't forget again, okay? I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner...and I don't know how I can live knowing that. Okay?
E: trying to fight away these thoughts:
C: JOHN
D: Lara. Look at me. Something will happen. I promise.
C: LARA
D: What? What is going to happen? There are no more appeals, there are no more anything. Exactly what miracle are we hoping for, John?
E: cruelly - but hushed
N: He looks down, beaten. She lets go of her anger.
C: LARA
D: I need you to do something for me.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Sure.
C: LARA
D: Stop bringing him.
C: JOHN
D: Come on...
C: LARA
D: He hates coming here. Look at him.
C: JOHN
D: Lara....
C: LARA
D: Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me.
N: John looks at his son, playing at a distance, his back to them. It's hard to argue with her, she's right.
C: LARA
D: You want to hear something funny?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Yes. Anything.
C: LARA
D: My mother tried to send me anti-aging cream.
N: John smiles, but like hers it may be the saddest smile in the world. They sit and watch Luke play.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John checks his bank statements and adds them up on the wall under MONEY. The total is $8,840.00. He stares at that figure for a moment.
S: INT. REALTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: EUGENIE, the REAL ESTATE AGENT, walks John to the door.
C: EUGENIE
D: You're sure that you don't want a lawn sign?
C: JOHN
D: I'm very sure. Thanks.
S: INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY
N: A STUDENT shows John how to use Photoshop to enlarge and crop a photo.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
N: John uses Photoshop, looking through family pictures for an appropriate one to use for Lara's ID. Some of them are of the family at a cottage. He finds one that will work and starts to crop himself and Luke (as a baby) out of the photo. Then he turns and notices Luke standing behind him, staring at the screen.

C: COPTER PILOT
D: On the left, Allegheny County Jail. Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been three escape attempts. No one's made it out alive. On your right...
N: Everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues. John stays fixed on the left window.
S: HIS POINT OF VIEW:
N: The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof.
S: INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CLASSROOM -- DAY
N: LYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle. John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR.
C: LYLA
D: On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY
N: John searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS. Clicks on one that reads EXPERIENCED HELICOPTER PILOT, COMBAT VET, WILL CONSIDER ANY OFFER. ANGLE ON JOHN'S WALL Where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the heading ESCAPE. Overlapping it he pins trimmed print-outs of several PILOT candidates. Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing site indicated with an X in a circle. Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In block letters beside it is the word "KEY?"

N: John parks and steps out of his car.
S: INT. UPTOWN LOUNGE -- NIGHT
N: Hip-hop blares, the clientele are low-lives, John doesn't exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for "Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED GUY at the bar who watches him. John approaches HARV.
C: JOHN
D: Mouss said to come see you.
C: HARV
D: He did, did he? What do you want?
C: JOHN
D: Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number.

C: MOUSS

C: JOHN
D: Some guy made a crack about Lara.
C: GRACE
D: So, that's what you do now: punch everyone who thinks she's guilty?
C: JOHN
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: GRACE
D: It means it's important what YOU believe, not --
C: JOHN
D: Really? So, what do you believe, Mom?
N: John stands and opens the back door.
C: GRACE
D: Why are you trying to start a fight?
C: JOHN
D: Come on, buddy! Where is his bag?
E: calling out back door to his mother
C: GRACE
D: Why are you doing this?!
N: Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears.
C: JOHN
D: No reason. I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake.
C: GRACE
D: Stop this!
N: John turns and sees GEORGE standing in the open doorway. He has heard everything. He gives his son a dismissive look and walks off towards his bedroom. John feels like a heel.
C: JOHN
D: Give Grandma a kiss.
E: to Luke
N: Luke does, and the two of them leave with his bag.
S: EXT. GRACE & GEORGE'S - INSIDE THE PRIUS -- DAY
N: John gets in and checks his mirror. Luke is staring at him.

S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY
N: John scans the room as he waits. Two children play in the set that is used to teach them how to speak to a prisoner behind glass using a phone. A moment later, a woman enters with a large shoulder bag. She is a NOTARY.
C: NOTARY
D: Mr. Brennan?
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- MORNING

C: LARA
D: You have nothing to apologize for. But you should have told me before this.

C: LARA
D: I don't want you not telling me things.
C: JOHN

S: INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY

S: INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CORRIDOR -- DAY

C: PAULA
D: I was wondering if I could ask you to water my plants next week; I'm going in for an operation.
C: JOHN
D: I hope it's nothing serious.
C: PAULA
D: My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me. He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him. But I'll be fine. Thanks.

S: INT. PRIUS -- DAY
N: John pulls into the empty parking lot beside Don's and waits. Checks his watch: 1:49 PM. A car pulls in. The guy sits there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant.
S: INT. PRIUS -- DAY
N: John checks his watch. 2:14. He looks around, knowing he is supposed to leave. He makes a call.
C: RECEPTIONIST

C: JOHN
D: Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: I will let him know.
E: O.S.
S: INT. PRIUS - DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON
N: John checks his watch: 2:27. His cell phone rings, displays the name MICK; John presses IGNORE. He feels for the gun between the seats.
S: EXT. DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON
N: The guy comes out of the restaurant. John watches him walk to his car. The man sees him and stares back. John checks his watch. 2:45. The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty. John presses the VOICEMAIL button on his phone.
C: MICK
D: Are you ever going to answer your goddamn phone?
E: V.O.
N: Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window.
C: MIKE
D: You were supposed to leave.
C: JOHN
D: I need them.
C: MIKE
D: You notice that guy was a cop?
C: JOHN
D: Which guy?
C: MIKE
D: The one with the red light in his back window.
N: John feels ridiculous. Mike hands him the documents.
C: MIKE
D: Just give me the money.
E: CONT'D
N: John hands him the envelope of money. Mike checks it.
C: MIKE
D: You want this too much. You're going to fuck it up.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and follows. John looks over the passports with their new names.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- AFTERNOON
N: Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging his lunch pale. John watches him go, then reaches down beside his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth. He hides it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY
N: John moves through the line toward the metal detector. He takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can get to it. He hands the dish to the guard.
C: JOHN
D: How are you doing today?
C: GUARD
D: Don't touch that.
C: JOHN
D: Sorry.
N: John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone -- John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors. JOHN pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY
N: John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors. He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator. He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump key. It fits. The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again. Visitors keep moving past him. He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is preoccupied at the door. He turns it harder. Nothing. He tries to pull it out. It's stuck. John panics. The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd. John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors sees what he is doing but averts her eyes. John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into the crowd and moves on. Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to the visiting room. WHITE 9-10-09 51. He throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to insert his key in the elevator. John rounds the corner into the visiting room. The camera stays on his face until we finally hear A DEAFENING ALARM.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR -- DAY
N: John waits in a line against the wall, beside a door to a small office. Through the glass he watches the MAJOR interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing. She nods and leaves, passing him with a look. The Major holds the door open for him.
S: INT. MAJOR'S OFFICE -- A SHORT TIME LATER
N: The MAJOR plays John the CCTV video from the corridor. He flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall. The crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms obscures the view of the elevator.
C: MAJOR
D: So, you are where in here?
C: JOHN
D: ...In the middle there.
C: MAJOR
D: In the middle. Can you point to yourself?
C: JOHN
D: It's hard to tell. I think that's me there. Why?
E: looks
N: He freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the background.
C: MAJOR
D: So that's not you there. By the elevator?
C: JOHN
D: ....No. I was over here. You want to tell me what's going on?
E: looks points to another person
C: MAJOR
D: You want me to tell you?
C: JOHN
D: Yes.
N: The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock.
C: MAJOR
D: You know what a bump key is?
C: JOHN
D: Sorry.
N: Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John. Finally:
C: MAJOR
D: If this was you, you might want to think about what's going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison.
N: The major stares right through him.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY
N: John heads toward the exit, accompanied by a guard. As he nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step ladder, holding a new CCTV camera.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY
N: Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past, noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby and vomits.
C: DETECTIVE COLLERO
D: -- The worst date you've ever been on? This was worse. And this guy? He really thinks he is doing great. Then he's driving me home and I know he's going to try and kiss me, so I pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm actually snoring, right in his car. Does that stop him?
N: John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him. They lock eyes. Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying attention and wonders what he's looking at.
C: DETECTIVE COLLERO
D: ...What?
E: CONT'D
N: John turns and walks away. Quinn keeps watching.
C: DETECTIVE QUINN
D: Did I tell you not to date cops?
N: Collero's eyes find John as well. He disappears around the corner.
S: INT. T-TRAIN -- DAY
N: John rides home, devastated that his plan has failed, and wondering what he will do. He checks over his shoulder to make sure he isn't being followed.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- DAY
N: John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door. He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun; dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.
C: MICK
D: Let me in, asshole!!
E: O.S.
S: EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS
N: Mick bangs again.
C: MICK
D: Open up! Your car is in the garage, I know you're in there!
E: O.S. more banging
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
N: John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows he can't let his brother see this. The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door and looks out and scowls.
C: MALE NEIGHBOR
D: What's your problem? He's not home!
C: MICK
D: Not home? So you're saying I'm blind?
C: MALE NEIGHBOR
D: No, I'm saying you're an idiot.
N: Mick pounds on the door aggressively. Then just gives up.
C: MICK
D: You know what? You're right. I am an idiot.
N: And he walks off to his car.
S: EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
N: John leans back against the wall, in the middle of the bare room, and listens to his brother's car start and drive away. AND AND
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING
N: John stands, staring at his wall, now a vast collage, layer upon layer of photographs and notes. And no answers.
C: LUKE
D: ...Dad?
E: O.S.
S: EXT. PARK -- DAY
N: John sits on a bench, frustrated and lost. Luke trots up.
C: LUKE
D: Can I have my cookies?
C: JOHN
D: You hungry? You want your sandwich?
C: LUKE
D: No.
N: John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention.
C: NICOLE
D: Carrie! I'm sorry. She just already has it all figured out. Nicole.
E: to John John nods awkwardly
C: JOHN
D: I remember.
C: NICOLE
D: Really?
E: knows he doesn't
C: JOHN
D: I remember your daughter.
E: smiles and admits
C: NICOLE
D: She's hard to forget. Oh, this is for you. Luke was supposed to bring it home.
E: digs in her bag
N: Hands him an envelope. He opens it and sees a birthday invitation with jungle animals on the cover.
C: JOHN
D: He has his father's memory.
C: NICOLE
D: It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please come; I'd love to meet your wife.
C: JOHN
D: I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated.
C: NICOLE
D: I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on, time for lunch. We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us?
E: to John
C: JOHN
D: Oh, we're pretty...you know....
C: NICOLE
D: Busy?
N: John smiles, busted.
C: NICOLE
D: Come on, we owe you for the cookies.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: That's true. And I made those cookies.
C: NICOLE
D: And learned how to pre-package them.
C: JOHN
D: Which requires a considerable amount of machinery. Come on, Luke.
N: They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind. Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment.
C: NICOLE
D: Do you trade off time with Luke?
C: JOHN
D: No. Luke and I are together full time.
C: NICOLE
D: Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.
C: JOHN
D: She'd like nothing better than to be here. With him. Lara. She really misses...all this.
C: NICOLE
D: I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?
C: JOHN
D: No. She's not like that. She'd... She's in prison.
E: has to admit
C: NICOLE
D: Oh.
C: JOHN
D: I don't tell most people.
C: NICOLE
D: I understand.
C: JOHN
D: She's innocent. She didn't kill the woman.
C: NICOLE
D: ...Good. I mean, I'm sure she didn't.
N: Nicole doesn't know what else to say.
C: JOHN
D: We should really be getting home.
C: NICOLE
D: Oh, okay.
E: feigns disappointment
C: JOHN
D: Thanks for the invitation. We'll try and make it.
E: waving the envelope
C: NICOLE
D: That would be great.
N: John heads back and scoops up Luke. Nicole watches, trying not to look dumbfounded.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON
N: John and Luke enter, John sorting through the mail. Nothing from Lara.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: John finishes writing a letter on lined paper. He opens his drawer; it is full of letters in yellow envelopes. He pulls one out; it is from Lara, on lined paper. He stuffs his new letter in the old yellow envelope.
S: INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
N: This is the only room that is still furnished. John pokes his head in, sees Luke on his bed playing by himself.
C: JOHN
D: You want to read a letter from Mom?
N: Luke shrugs as if he doesn't care, but then scoots over in his bed so that his dad can sit beside him. John does. He pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads.
C: JOHN
D: Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As Much As Chocolate...
E: CONT'D
C: LUKE
D: She didn't write that.
C: JOHN
D: My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out.
S: EXT. PAULA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON
N: Luke and John water Paula's vegetable garden.
C: LUKE
D: But what's wrong with her?
C: JOHN
D: She's not feeling well.
C: LUKE
D: Why didn't she just stay home?
C: JOHN
D: Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed.
C: LUKE
D: How do you know when you're that sick?
C: JOHN
D: The doctors do tests.
N: Something tweaks. John turns and looks back across the alley, at his open garage...and remembers their conversation. He drops the hose and takes Luke's hand.

S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - LATER -- NIGHT
N: The camera swirls as John searches the wall and photos of delivery vans arriving at the jail. Not seeing what he wants, he charges the desk & rifles through more photos. WHITE 9-10-09 59. He finally snatches the photo he's looking for. He turns it over -- on it is written TUESDAY 9:30 AM. And right over the phrase FIND THE KEY he pins the photo of a delivery van from a medical laboratory.
S: EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- MORNING
N: Parked at a distance, John watches from inside his Prius. Finally, a DRIVER steps out of the jail carrying a tray of test results. He opens the back door of the van.
S: EXT. STREETS -- DAY
N: John follows the van.
S: EXT. NURSING HOME -- DAY
N: John watches as the driver steps out with a tray, point and push his key fob, lock the doors and enter the nursing home. IN THE PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER - John watches his stopwatch. The driver returns with a tray. John hits the stop button. 1 MINUTE 48 SECONDS.

S: EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY
N: The driver heads for the van as John opens the back door and climbs out. Oblivious to his narrow escape, John closes the door and walks away a heartbeat before the driver gets there.

C: JOHN
D: Luke! Time for bed.
S: INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
N: John enters the child's bedroom and stops dead. The wall over Luke's bed is covered with crayon scribbles, imitating the chart on his father's bedroom walls. Luke walks into the room, and steps up beside his father, staring at the wall. He takes his father's hand, and the two just stand there in silence.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY

E: CONT'D

S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY
N: John stares at the wall -- MONEY is down to $1,497. He rifles through a drawer, finds a pair of sunglasses. He snatches a baseball cap from a top shelf. He tosses a bag on the bed, unzips it and pulls out the gun.
S: EXT. AIRPORT LONG TERM PARKING LOT -- DAY
N: John unscrews the license plate from a dusty black Prius. He sticks the plate under his jacket, stands and checks over his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot.
S: INT. BANK AND MALL PARKING LOT -- DAY
N: A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the stolen license plate. Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do this. Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks. A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.
C: ELAINE
D: What are you doing?! You almost killed us!
C: JOHN
D: Are you --?
C: ELAINE
D: Are you out of your mind?! You don't look?!
N: She stoops to grab the few items that fell. He tries to help.
C: JOHN
D: I am so sorry --
C: ELAINE
D: Get away! Get away from us!
N: She stands and runs for her car. John returns to the car and sits, leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming. He sits there, letting the failure and his disgust for his weakness wash over him.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- AFTERNOON
N: John sits in the children's area, waiting for the line of visitors to get shorter. One look at his face and we can see how tortured he is. He has his cell phone to his ear:

S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- AFTERNOON
N: John stands in the corner, staring out through the high, thick windows. He turns as he hears Lara and other prisoners coming. He tries to smile, but she knows something is wrong.
C: LARA
D: What's wrong?
C: JOHN
D: Nothing.
C: LARA
D: Is it Luke?
C: JOHN
D: No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved.
E: MORE
C: JOHN
D: I told him traveling that distance would be a hardship on us, that Luke was already having trouble at school. Which is true. I haven't been spending enough time with him.
E: CONT'D
C: LARA
D: You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do.
C: JOHN
D: That's nice, that the two of you talk. What world do I live in, Lara?
E: stung
C: LARA
D: I don't know, but it's not the real one. I am in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that -- !
N: A guard steps up and raps her knuckles on the table to get their attention. Only John looks up.
C: FEMALE GUARD
D: We good here?
C: JOHN
D: Yes. Sorry.
N: Lara lowers her voice a little, but not her intensity. The guard walks away under:
C: LARA
D: Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better?
C: JOHN
D: Got it. I'm sorry.
C: LARA
D: And now you're apologizing. You really are a gem.
C: JOHN
D: What do you want from me?
C: LARA
D: Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her.
C: JOHN
D: Because I knew you didn't.
E: stopped dead
C: LARA
D: Then you'd be wrong.
N: She leans forward and whispers in his ear.
C: LARA
D: I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet.
E: CONT'D
N: She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.
C: LARA
D: I'm sorry. I'm actually very sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the changing room. John watches, unable to breathe.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
N: Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then disappears behind the partition. She sits on the bench, leans her head between her knees, and breaks into shards.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS
N: John exits along with all the other visitors, destroyed by what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head. Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing there. Commands him: GUARD #2 Sir, you cannot stand there. (beat) SIR, you need to exit the building NOW.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- MOMENTS LATER
N: Lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition. She picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak.
C: JOHN
D: Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will. I know who you are.
N: She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into the cradle. She pounds on the window. He just stares at her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER
N: John steps out and sees the MAJOR waiting with his keys. They exchange a look.
C: JOHN
D: Thank you.
N: The Major nods and locks the door. John heads out.
S: INT. TOY SHOP -- DAY
N: Luke in his arms, John takes a My Little Pony off the shelf.
C: JOHN
D: You think?
C: LUKE
D: Girls love them.
E: already an expert
S: INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY
N: Grace opens the door. George stands a few steps behind her, quiet. Grace sees John and is immediately concerned.
C: JOHN
D: Hi Mom.
C: GRACE
D: What are you doing here?
C: JOHN
D: I've got class.
C: GRACE
D: Five o'clock at night?
C: JOHN
D: Yes. Bye.
E: kisses Luke
N: Luke runs in as John walks off.
S: EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
N: John's father watches through the window as his son leaves. In his gut, George knows something is wrong.
S: EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT
N: John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner where he noticed kids selling drugs. A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks his watch and settles in to wait.
S: EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT
N: John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.
S: EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT
N: John follows the flashy car at a distance. It stops at another corner and something is exchanged. It drives on; John follows.
S: EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT
N: Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill. The flashy car parks and David crosses the street. Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks over the fences. He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch. He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and the light goes out again. WHITE 9-10-09 68. John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he came. John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears. Fade to BLACK. Beat, then: BANG! BANG! BANG!
S: EXT. DRUG DEALER'S BACK YARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT
N: John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch, holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is no way he wouldn't see him. John holds his breath and waits. The porch light flicks off, the locks are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens. As before, the two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in John's ears is so loud we can barely hear anything else. John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking over the trash cans -- and onto the porch! He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier -- ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.
S: INT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately attacks David, biting his leg. David screams in agony.
C: JOHN
D: Back up! Get back!
E: to Alex
N: Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.
C: ALEX
D: -- Shoot them both!
C: JOHN
D: -- I'll shoot the dog!
C: ALEX
D: -- Shoot the dog!
C: THUG
D: -- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!
N: John fires into the floor beside the dog.
C: ALEX
D: -- You want the police here, asshole?!
C: JOHN
D: -- Good idea!
N: John fires two more shots into the floor.
C: ALEX
D: -- Put the gun down!
E: to thug
N: The thug obeys, rests it against the wall.
C: JOHN
D: -- Call the dog off!! Put it away!
C: ALEX
D: -- Release!
N: The dog stops its attack but goes back to barking.
C: JOHN
D: -- Put it away!! PUT IT AWAY!!
E: aims gun at it
N: Alex reluctantly opens a closet door.
C: ALEX
D: In! Get in!
N: He has to shove the barking dog into the closet.
C: JOHN
D: You, too!
E: to thug
C: THUG
D: I'm not getting in there!
N: John fires into the wall!
C: ALEX
D: Get in!
N: And the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog. John sees the bolt and drives it home, locking the door.
C: JOHN
D: -- Give me that chair!
N: Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him. John props it under the handle of the closet door.
C: JOHN
D: Move!
E: CONT'D
N: He shoves David forward, closer to Alex.
C: ALEX
D: You're dead.
C: DAVID
D: I didn't do anything!!
C: ALEX
D: You brought him!
C: DAVID
D: I didn't bring him!
C: JOHN
D: Shut up!
N: He pushes them both back into the next room; the dog in the closet never stops barking.
S: INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT
N: John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between them.
C: JOHN
D: On your knees! Hands behind your head!
N: John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.
C: DAVID
D: I can't kneel!
C: JOHN
D: On the floor!
N: David kneels with great difficulty. Alex calmly does as he's told, his eyes on John. John grabs the paper bag out of Alex's hand and opens it, finds a couple thousand in cash.
C: JOHN
D: Where's the rest?
E: CONT'D
C: DAVID
D: That's twelve hundred dollars! Here, take it.
E: emptying his pockets
N: A couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor.
C: JOHN
D: Where do you keep your money?!
E: gun on Alex
N: Alex scoffs, seeing weakness in John.
C: ALEX
D: Yeah, I'm going to give you my money.
C: JOHN
D: I'll shoot you!
C: ALEX
D: You won't even shoot a dog.
C: JOHN
D: Tell me!
C: ALEX
D: Shoot the floor again, impress me.
N: John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his gun to his head while he is on the ground bleeding.
C: JOHN
D: I'm going to kill you both.
C: ALEX
D: No, I'm going to kill you both.
C: DAVID
D: Give him your money!
C: ALEX
D: Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.
E: to David
N: Enraged, John fires a round into Alex's leg. Alex screams.
C: DAVID
D: Stop it!!
C: ALEX
D: See? You aren't going to kill me. That was the worst you can do. So, now you've done it. Go home. I'll come find you and kill you.
E: smiles thru pain
N: John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours it on the floor.
C: ALEX
D: You're wasting some good shit.
E: CONT'D
N: Now he pours it on Alex.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.
N: John smashes the bottle on the floor; tequila goes everywhere.
C: THUG
D: What's going on?! Let me out!
E: O.S.
C: ALEX
D: You going to burn me out?
N: John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to yell and pound. Now calmly:
C: JOHN
D: Yeah. That's what I'm going to do.
C: DAVID
D: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
C: JOHN
D: Your money.
C: ALEX
D: This is a meth lab, you idiot!
E: no longer smiling
C: JOHN
D: No. It was.
N: And he tosses the burning rag at the smashed bottle. David screams as the room explodes in flames.
C: ALEX
D: My kid is upstairs!!
E: suddenly desperate
C: JOHN
D: -- What??
C: ALEX
D: MY KID!!
N: Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned, John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.
C: DAVID
D: Let me go!!
C: JOHN
D: Get up there!!
N: John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the trail of blood.
C: DAVID
D: The house is going to explode!
N: ANGLE ON BACK DOOR Fire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun leans against the wall where the thug left it. The closet door rocks as the thug kicks. The chair won't give way.
S: INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT
N: John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM. Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind the small bed, his back to us. Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice. A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the floor. John pulls himself out from under David as... Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward. David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and.... John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down. John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David. David looks around through the roiling smoke:
C: JOHN
D: Is anyone up here?!
N: He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet -- empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag on the floor half-filled with cash. John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into the trash bag.
S: INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- CONTINUOUS
N: The dog barks; the door SPLINTERS.
S: INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS
N: John steps over the bodies; sees David looking up at him.
C: DAVID
D: Don't leave me. I don't want to burn. Don't let me burn.
N: The hall is now thick with smoke. John stares terrified at the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.
S: INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- MOMENTS LATER
N: John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.
S: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at the partially open window. John struggles to get the car turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his way into the car. Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun. John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the car, the thug getting off a shot.
S: EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS
N: John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant and shattering a taillight.
S: INT. PRIUS - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS
N: John slams the transmission into Drive and speeds off down the street. The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds of the dying man. John keeps throwing looks over his shoulder.
C: DAVID
D: I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
N: Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead. John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.
S: EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT
N: John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered.
S: INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - TOILET -- NIGHT
N: Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the wound in his side. He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies a bandage, fresh from the box. He pulls a new shirt and jacket from a Target bag. A moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full of cash into his backpack.
S: INT. FAST FOOD JOINT -- NIGHT
N: John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket. He barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out of the restaurant. Cut to BLACK.
S: EXT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: Water streams from the house, the front door and windows broken by firemen who now pack up their gear to leave. LIEUTENANT NABULSI strides into shot, drinking a Red Bull, which he crushes and discards on the porch.
S: INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS
N: Nabulsi climbs the stairs to find SGT. HARRIS watching the CSI team work. Nabulsi steps up behind the CSI worker.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Get out of my way.
E: almost a whisper
N: The man flees like he just saw the prince of darkness. Nabulsi cocks his head and looks down at the dead man.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: What do we have?
E: CONT'D
C: SGT. HARRIS
D: A miracle. Meth lab in the basement, the house still standing. Should be just a crater.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Do we know him?
E: straddles Alex
C: SGT. HARRIS
D: Alex Gaidar, history of violence and drug trafficking.
N: Nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: He have a kid?
C: SGT. HARRIS
D: Neighbor said wife left with him last year. Big surprise there.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: They type all this blood yet?
C: SGT. HARRIS
D: No, but someone left through the back door bleeding. Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.
N: Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- NIGHT
N: John snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns and walks back to the Prius.
S: INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters, carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair. When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas, reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.
C: JOHN
D: Hi. What are you doing up?
N: George shrugs. An uncomfortable silence.
C: JOHN
D: I've come to get Luke.
E: CONT'D
N: George nods. After another silence, John starts down the hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him.
C: GEORGE
D: John? Are you alright?
N: John turns around, surprised.
C: JOHN
D: I'm fine.
N: The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the room. His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane tickets and passports.
S: INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
N: John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here, and is overwhelmed.
S: INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
N: George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket. We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the passport and reads each of the false names.
S: INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
N: John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like this. He tries to wake Luke.
C: JOHN
D: Hey. Hey, buddy.
N: Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment.
S: INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT
N: John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock. It's almost five. How could that have happened?
S: INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT
N: John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food.
C: JOHN
D: What do you say?
C: LUKE
D: Thank you.
C: JOHN
D: Give Grandma a big kiss.
C: LUKE
D: I'm too tired to kiss.
C: JOHN
D: Luke...
C: GRACE
D: I'll get lots of kisses next weekend. We want to take him to the Harvest Festival in Kutztown, where they have the Clydesdales.
E: to John
N: John thinks about saying something, can't. He watches Luke give Grace a kiss.
C: LUKE
D: Thank you, Grandma.
N: John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway. His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it. The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket. John realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows.
C: JOHN
D: Bye Mom.
N: They kiss. John's father stands behind him.
C: GEORGE
D: Goodbye.
N: George grabs his son in an awkward hug. John is shocked. He pats his father's back. They break.
C: JOHN
D: Let's go.
E: to Luke
N: John leaves. The front door closes. Grace walks away.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- PRE-DAWN
N: John stands in the brightly lit, glass-walled kiosk of a rental car company, the Prius parked at the curb, as the sun threatens to break over the horizon.
S: EXT. STREET NEAR ALEX'S HOUSE -- PRE-DAWN
N: Nabulsi kneels beside a fire hydrant, using a shard from a taillight to scrape at a smudge of flaking black paint. Harris comes running up, out of breath, from the alley.
C: SGT. HARRIS
D: Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase a black car down the alley, so that's probably his. We'll have the taillight debris at the lab by the time it opens.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Before.
N: Nabulsi stands and hands him the large shard of glass.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
N: John packs a backpack -- two white lab coats, wire cutters, a large screwdriver, two rolls of duct tape, the handgun, insulin vials, etc.
S: INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING
N: Luke sits on his bedroom floor, trying to cram a firetruck into his already full rollerboard.
C: LUKE
D: Can I carry it?
E: calls
N: John appears with a box of trash bags.
C: JOHN
D: No. Just what fits in your bag.
N: John hurries off.
C: LUKE
D: ....What about my pockets?
C: JOHN
D: Or your pockets.
E: O.S.
N: Luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table. He digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket. A quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
N: John takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35. He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos, sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything. He decides it is too late to worry. He loosens an edge of wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.
S: EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING
N: Luke sits in the back seat with their carry-on bags. John tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the back. He picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to the alley. He looks around, then stuffs this final bag into his neighbor's trash can.
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- MORNING
N: John tosses the last trash bags over the side of the dumpster that sits in front of a demolished house. As he closes the tailgate we get a good look at the broken taillight.
S: INT. PRIUS - DRIVING
N: He checks the clock on the dashboard and drives faster, taking a quick glance at his son to see if he is okay back there.
S: EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- MORNING
N: John sits in his car in the back alley, watching the parking lot. The driver comes out carrying trays of test results and puts them in the back of his van. John grabs the large wire cutters and screwdriver from his car and hops out. He takes a few steps to the rear of the one-story building, pries open the phone box and snips the phone wires.
S: INT. P.M.H. LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT
N: A clerk on the phone is cut off. She jabs the connection key, does not get a dial tone -- looks to the lights on the other phone lines and sees them go out as...
S: EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT
N: John snips the last wire and hops back into the car. He is moving before the van exits the parking lot.

They follow procedure in taking the prisoner into the hospital. The sheriff watches until they are safe inside, then leaves.
S: INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- DAY
N: Nabulsi inspects Luke's room, still fully furnished, the curious faded crayon drawing on the wall. He spots a couple of coins on the floor. He picks up a quarter, and flips it. Harris steps into the room.

S: INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - ROOM 7725 -- DAY
N: A second handgun and holster slides across the floor to meet the one that already lies by John's feet. The two guards kneel, facing the far wall. John pulls a roll of duct tape from the backpack and tosses it to the terrified nurse.

C: LARA
D: John --
C: JOHN
D: Does it look like I'm going home?! Tell him he is alone now and his mother and father aren't coming back!
N: Lara stares at him with hatred, mutters:
C: LARA
D: You son of a bitch.
N: Lara pulls off her prison garb, standing before them naked except for her panties. She quite purposely does not turn away or cover herself, but lets her eyes burn into him. John presses the STOPWATCH button on his watch and the COUNTER starts running.
S: EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY
N: A squad car pulls up outside the hospital's main entrance. One officer strides into the Emergency Room while the other takes a look around the parking lot.
S: INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR HALLWAY
N: Lara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall and stares after them.
C: DR. LIFSON
D: What are you doing?
N: John yanks Lara's arm and makes a dash for the elevator, pulling his gun from his pocket. The Duty Nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the hall, throwing open the door to room 7725.

N: Nabulsi jabs the elevator button. He reacts as a HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD comes running toward him.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: What's wrong?
N: Before he can answer, the elevator doors open and they come face to face with John and Lara. John sees their police IDs and levels his weapon. Around them, patients and employees scream and run away.
C: JOHN
D: Back away!
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Don't be stupid. Drop the weapon.
C: JOHN
D: Get back!
C: LT. NABULSI

N: HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2 leads the way. Nabulsi and Harris pass him at the door as he yells into his walkie. HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2 Male and female; white lab coats! Parking levels!
S: INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS
C: LARA
D: Oh please oh please oh please...
E: freaking out
C: JOHN
D: It'll be okay. Look at me! Do what I say; it'll be okay; I promise.

N: She nods.
C: JOHN
D: Take the coat off.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL AND P1 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
N: Nabulsi, Harris and the guard bound down the stairs into the lower elevator lobby. Nabulsi sees the doors aren't opening and runs back to the stairs, meeting the cop from upstairs on his way down.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Stay here!
N: HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2 (into walkie) Parking garage! Get your asses down here! Nabulsi and Harris leave them and thunder down the stairs.
S: INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
N: The elevator doors open and John tosses the lab coats out toward a trash can in the direction of the garage. He pounds the elevator button.
S: INT. P2 LEVEL
N: Nabulsi and Harris burst onto this floor -- see the elevator doors are closed.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Watch that door!
N: Harris obeys as Nabulsi flings himself down the next flight.
S: INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
N: The elevator isn't closing. John slams the button repeatedly. He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing. Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the parked cars. Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi realizes they couldn't have escaped this way; he's been had.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Who's in the lobby?!
E: shouts into walkie
N: But he only gets static. He charges back toward the stairs.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - LOBBY LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
N: The doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner. They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them. They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and speaks. HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 Main floor, rear corridor. John and Lara turn a corner. John spots the SHIPPING OFFICE. They enter and head for the loading bay.
S: INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
N: Nabulsi and Harris break into the lobby, sweating. Officers run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene, realizes they couldn't have gone out the front. He hears a shout: HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.) Back here! They turn and run in the direction of the voice, turning the corner and seeing the SECURITY GUARD at the end of the hall, who sees them coming turns and runs off after John and Lara.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: Get units to Grant Street!
E: into radio, on the run
S: EXT. HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS
N: John punches open the door and they hop down off the dock and take off for the street.
S: EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
N: John tugs Lara across the street, dodging traffic. He yanks off his jacket and pulls it back on inside-out -- this side is black and gold.
S: EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
N: Nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses.
S: EXT. NEARBY PEDESTRIAN MALL -- DAY
N: Lara and John weave through the fans.
C: JOHN
D: Put your hair down.
N: Lara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then opens a door. Leaving the throng of fans, he guides Lara through and down the stairs into the T-Train Subway Station.
S: EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
N: Nabulsi runs to the crosswalk as Harris takes the other direction. The other two officers take the far sidewalks.
S: INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS
N: John and Lara quicken their pace. The camera tilts up and to the glass ceiling.
S: 278A EXT. PEDESTRIAN MALL -- CONTINUOUS 278A
N: Nabulsi searches the faces in the mall. He looks down through the station skylight, catches a fleeting glimpse of them. He runs for the entrance, his walkie flying to his face.
C: LT. NABULSI
D: They're on the platform! Block stations in either direction! Call the Port Authority. Stop all trains!
S: INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS
N: John sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs. Almost dragging Lara, John nudges past slower people to make it onto the train. Then they wait. The doors don't close.
S: EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Walkie in hand, Harris jumps into their unmarked car and pulls out. Two SQUAD CARS wail out past him. WHITE 9-10-09 96.

N: Above -- Nabulsi sees the train and shoves past commuters.
S: INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS
N: John spots him coming, slips the long screwdriver from the small backpack he's carrying. Lara sees him tighten his fingers around the grip. The doors finally close just as:
S: INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS
N: Nabulsi bounds down the stairs. The train leaves the station. Nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it.
S: EXT. T-TRAIN STATION -- DAY
N: This station sits above ground. Three squad cars scream up. The officers clamor out of the cars and run for the platform.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- DAY
N: Harris skids the unmarked vehicle around the corner, heading parallel to the underground.
S: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL -- DAY
N: Nabulsi runs down the tracks, the car ahead nowhere in sight.
S: INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS
N: The T-Train DRIVER gets an emergency call from the base. He looks back into the car as IT RISES UP OUT OF THE UNDERGROUND. Daylight floods the car as the train emerges from underground. John jams the long screwdriver into the door and PRIES IT OPEN.
S: EXT. T-TRAIN AND TRACKS -- DAY
N: The wheels SCREECH and the brakes SEIZE. Passengers topple to the floor. John grabs Lara and they leap out onto the tracks. He finds the slit he cut in the tall fence. They slip out through it, onto the street and into the parking lot beyond.
S: INT. HARRIS' UNMARKED CAR -- CONTINUOUS
N: Harris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks. He locks up his BRAKES as he sees the stalled T-Train. WHITE 9-10-09 97.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS
N: John yanks off his jacket as they jump into the rented SUV. John calms his racing heart, drives away and turns the corner.
S: EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS
N: Harris leaps from his vehicle and runs to the fence on his side of the tracks -- it is ten feet tall with razor wire, no way over it. He sees: Nabulsi charge up out of the tunnel. He jumps into the stalled train car, looks around, doesn't see John and Lara.
S: EXT. TUNNEL UNDER RIVER -- MORNING
N: The SUV comes up out of the dark and drives away from the city center, as a police helicopter swoops overhead, going the opposite direction.
S: INT. RENTED SUV -- MORNING
N: John checks the counter, still running on his watch. 11:05. He wets his thumb and rubs his wrist until the 15 is erased. All that remains now is the second number: 35. They merge into traffic heading toward the suburbs.
S: EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- MORNING
N: Nabulsi pushes through the hole in the wire. Harris runs across the tracks with his jacket off, having scaled the fence on the far side.

N: He nods toward the glove box
C: JOHN
D: There's a case in there. Brush, moisturizer, makeup. Everything you had was old. I hope I got it right.
E: CONT'D
N: She opens the glove box, unzips the case, and is touched by this small gesture.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - HOMICIDE DIVISION -- DAY
N: Detective Collero, who we last saw when they arrested Lara, stops by Detective Quinn's cubicle.
C: DETECTIVE COLLERO
D: You want to take a guess who just escaped from jail?
S: EXT. NICOLE'S HOUSE -- MORNING
N: Lara sits in the SUV at the curb. John waits at the door. It is opened by BRENDA, Nicole's mother.
C: BRENDA
D: Hello.
C: JOHN
D: Hi. I'm here for my son.
C: BRENDA
D: Oh, they aren't back yet.
C: JOHN
D: Back from where?
C: BRENDA
D: The zoo.
C: JOHN
D: ...The zoo?

D: It's a zoo party. They ate first.
E: in case he's worried: MORE
C: BRENDA
D: They should be back in about an hour. Would you like to wait?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHH
D: No. Thank you.
N: John turns and walks back to the SUV. Brenda watches for a moment, made curious by his behavior. He gets into the vehicle. Lara is in a panic.
C: LARA
D: What's wrong?
N: John punches ZOO into POINTS OF INTEREST on the GPS.
C: LARA
D: Where's Luke?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: He's at the party.
N: He sneaks a look at his stopwatch: 24 MINUTES and counting.
C: LARA
D: What party? You said the party was here.

D: She?
E: can't help herself

D: Estimated drive time: seventeen minutes.
C: JOHN
D: Carrie's mom. Nicole.
N: He drops the transmission into gear and speeds off.

D: Canvas the neighbors. We're looking for the boy and anything they've noticed in the last few days.
S: EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING
N: John drives like a man possessed.
S: INT. SUV - DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION -- MORNING
N: John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror, the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them. John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer at 35, praying he's not their target. The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the four lane street. John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch - 29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS.
C: GPS VOICE
D: Time to destination: eleven minutes.
N: Lara sees him sweat, unaware of the significance of the time.
S: EXT. STREETS -- DAY
N: The SUV swerves around a corner, heading into the outskirts of town.
S: INT. SUV - FOUR LANE STREET -- DAY
N: John's eyes flick to his stopwatch: 32 minutes flicks to 33. Signs appear quickly now. Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next Left. John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to make this choice -- their freedom, or their son. Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his grandparents after all. Then there it is: The sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on the right. The sign to the Zoo sits behind it, pointing to the next road on the left. 34:02, 34:03, 34:04... John takes the freeway ramp.
S: EXT. INTERSTATE -- CONTINUOUS
N: The SUV climbs up the on-ramp, leaving the city behind.
S: INT. SUV - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS

D: You took the wrong turn! It's back there.

E: CONT'D no response no response
C: JOHN
D: She'll call my parents.
C: LARA

D: They'll take care of him, I will figure out how to get him to us.
C: LARA
D: Are you out of your mind!
C: JOHN
D: I tried!! There's no more time!! Any second now there's going to be a roadblock ahead! It might be there now!! If we don't get out now we don't get out!!
N: Lara sits back in her seat, stunned and horrified, as John continues.
C: JOHN
D: I promise. I promise I will find a way to get Luke to us. I will find some way.
E: CONT'D
N: Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch. John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he slams his foot on the brakes! The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn. Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision. John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder, miraculously facing in the right direction. John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt. She opens the door and steps out. John closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back together. He opens his door and steps out.
S: EXT. INTERSTATE HWY - SHOULDER -- DAY
N: John sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the field beyond. He sits beside her in silence. Behind them the cars whip by. No one even thinks to stop to see if they need help. Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field. There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know how they got here. Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger with his. He slowly gathers strength from her touch.
S: INT. SUV - ON THE SHOULDER -- MOMENTS LATER
N: They close the doors, and John starts the engine and they drive forward. John takes the first exit.
S: EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - ALLEY -- DAY

C: LARA
D: My favorite.
N: John starts the car.
C: LARA
D: I'm going to sit back here, okay?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Sure.
N: Luke plays with a toy. Lara closes the door behind her. She looks out the window and sees: NICOLE standing at the entrance, looking at her. Not exactly sure why she does it, LARA offers her a grateful smile. NICOLE watches them pull away, confused about what she should do.
S: INT. SUV - ZOO PARKING LOT EXIT -- CONTINUOUS
N: John drifts up to the stop sign at the intersection. A sign points out the interstate to the left -- and he can see the overpass and freeway entrance; the business district to the right. He checks his watch: 48 minutes. He resets it to zero. Game over. He switches on the radio and searches for NEWS. Luke taps Lara on the shoulder. She leans down.
C: LUKE
D: I think we're going to the cottage.
C: LARA
D: Really?
N: He nods knowingly.
C: LUKE
D: I have money.
N: Lara almost loses it; smiles.
C: LARA
D: Good. Then I'll stick close to you.
C: LUKE
D: Okay.
N: John finds the news station.
C: NEWS RADIO
D: -- Traffic down to two lanes at the tollbooths. And downtown is worse. Stay away from the train station if you are trying to get anywhere. Not sure what is happening but a KPGH caller says trains aren't moving and commuters are getting irate.

N: John turns right, heading downtown.
S: INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY
N: Detective Quinn spots Harris fly in carrying a brimming green trash bag. Quinn jumps up and follows him into the SITUATION ROOM. COLLERO hurries to catch up. Harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she enters. Quinn immediately dives into the contents. HARRIS and COLLERO share an awkward look.
C: SGT. HARRIS

N: She and Harris dig into the crumpled papers and photos.

E: to Collero
N: Collero gives Quinn a burning look. Nabulsi enters.
S: EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DAY
N: John double-parks and pulls on a ball cap. Traffic is snarled, the place is awash with police and squad cars. Hundreds of people mill out front.
C: JOHN
D: Stay in the car.
N: John puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle of it all. Lara watches, certain he will be spotted and arrested. John steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors. He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested. He approaches an elderly couple.
S: EXT. INTERSTATE -- DAY
N: The SUV heads up the on-ramp.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY

N: And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat, with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll.
C: JOHN
D: This thing is very good on gas.
E: re: SUV

E: as they exit:
N: Nabulsi spins the quarter again, staring at it as if it will give him the answer.

N: Elizabeth turns at her car, is slammed in the head with the extinguisher and she falls dead. The extinguisher is tossed to the floor and rolls.

Quinn gets there, kneels.
