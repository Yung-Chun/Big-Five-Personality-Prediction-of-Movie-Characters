N: A series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient. BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The huge bat in an elegant follow-through...

N: JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five. PULLBACK REVEALS: A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar -- also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it glows with the candles like some religious altar. We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent.
C: ANNIE
D: I believe in the Church of Baseball. I've tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones -- I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan...
E: V.O. beat
N: PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up. ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty, knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, National and International borders. She's cosmic.
C: ANNIE
D: I know things. For instance -- There are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary. And -- There are 108 stitches in a baseball. When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance. But it just didn't work out between us. The Lord laid too much guilt on me. I prefer metaphysics to theology. You see, there's no guilt in baseball... and it's never boring.
E: V.O. beat beat beat beat beat
N: ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps. She sits on a bench and
C: ANNIE
D: Which makes it like sex. There's never been a ballplayer slept with me who didn't have the best year of his career. Making love is like hitting a baseball -- you just got to relax and concentrate.
E: beat beat
N: ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up her calves as she does.
C: ANNIE
D: Besides, I'd never sleep with a player hitting under .250 unless he had a lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove man up the middle. A woman's got to have standards.
E: beat
N: SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side. Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.
C: ANNIE
D: The young players start off full of enthusiasm and energy but they don't realize that come July and August when the weather is hot it's hard to perform at your peak level. The veterans pace themselves better. They finish stronger. They're great in September. While I don't believe a woman needs a man to be fulfilled, I do confess an interest in finding the ultimate guy -- he'd have that youthful exuberance but the veteran's sense of timing...
E: beat beat
N: ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.
C: ANNIE
D: Y'see there's a certain amount of "life-wisdom" I give these boys. I can expand their minds. Sometimes when I've got a ballplayer alone I'll just read Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so sweet -- they always stay and listen. Of course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.
E: beat beat
N: ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly, in her cleavage.
C: ANNIE
D: I make then feel confident. They make me feel safe. And pretty.
N: ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses. Stylish and slightly mad.
C: ANNIE
D: What I give them lasts a life-time. What they give me lasts 142 games. Sometimes it seems like a bad trade. But bad trades are part of baseball -- who can forget Frank Robinson or Milt Pappas, for Godsakes! It's a long season and you got to trust it.
E: quickly rebounding beat
N: ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK
N: A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway. ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic, old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.
C: ANNIE
D: I've tried them all -- I really have -- and the only church that truly feeds the soul -- day in, day out -- is the Church of Baseball.
E: beat

S: EXT. THE CHURCH -- DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK
N: Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium carved into the center of an old Tobacco town. People are arriving on foot from all around... "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air. CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate doing his famous Bill Haley routine. A comic pitcher's windup full of twists and goofy choreography.
C: RECORDING OVER P.A.
D: One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, rock... Four o'clock, five o'clock, six o'clock rock...
N: ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and friend. A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women, dressed in tight pants, tight everything. Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE. FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".
C: RECORDING OVER P.A.
D: Seven o'clock, eight o'clock, nine o'clock rock... we're gonna rock around the clock tonight
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT/INT. THE DURHAM BULL DUGOUT -- NIGHT
N: As Max Patkin continues his routine, players warm up, and -- THE MANAGER, JOE RIGGINS, 45, known merely as SKIP, short for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges. LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly together. Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the giant chaw into his mouth.
C: SKIP
D: Where's Ebby?
C: LARRY
D: Ain't he warning up?
C: SKIP
D: No. The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
E: cynically
C: LARRY
D: Better find our bonus baby, eh?
N: A PLAYER, DEKE, 25, stuffs a hot dog into his mouth.

S: INT. THE DURHAM CLUBHOUSE -- NIGHT
N: SKIP enters, shouting --
C: SKIP
D: Ebby?!
N: CLOSE ON A BARE ASS -- Baseball uniform around the ankles, short t-shirt on top, and on top of that the head of EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH, baseball cap on backwards. EBBY is a great looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence, naivete and horniness of youth. Life is a party. A YOUNG WOMAN, MILLIE, 20, half nude, is dressing quickly. EBBY WHIRLS as Skip enters.
C: SKIP
D: Jesus. Game starts in four minutes! Why ain't you warm?!
E: beat
C: EBBY
D: I am warm.
C: SKIP
D: I'm fining you a hundred dollars. Jesus, Ebby, this is your professional debut tonight -- you know how many guys out there'd give blood to be in your shoes an' you're leavin' your fastball in the locker room for some piece of ass!
N: MILLIE LOOKS OUT FROM BEHIND A BAT RACK -- Outraged.
C: MILLIE
D: Skip, It's me! I'm not some quote piece of ass unquote.
C: SKIP
D: Oh, Millie, jeez, sorry -- I didn't recognize ya. Don't take it personal but if I catch you in here again you're banned from the ballpark.
C: MILLIE
D: You can't ban me from the ballpark 'cause Daddy donated the scoreboard and if you banned me he might take the scoreboard away.
C: SKIP
D: Whatta we need a scoreboard for? We haven't scored any runs all year Get your ass out there.
E: tough, to Ebby
N: As Skip starts to leave.
C: EBBY
D: Hey Boss, I got a question.
C: SKIP
D: What?!
E: stops, exasperated
C: EBBY
D: You think I need a nickname? I think I need a nickname. The great ones have nicknames -- somethin' like Oil Can or Catfish...
N: Skip stares at him. He can't believe this guy.
C: SKIP
D: Ya got three minutes.
N: SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS BACK OUT TO THE FIELD -- And Ebby unperturbed, turns his attention back to Millie.
C: EBBY
D: Got time for another quickie?
C: MILLIE
D: Jesus, you got a game to pitch!

C: RECORDING
D: When the clock strikes two, three, and four and the band slows down we'll yell for more, gonna rock around the clock tonight.
N: ANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his act. P.O.V. A LATIN PLAYER PLAYING PEPPER.
C: ANNIE
D: Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he?
C: JACKSON
D: Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
E: reading the program

C: ANNOUNCER
D: "The Greatest Show on Dirt" -- your own Durham Bulls!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE DUGOUT
N: CLOSE ON ANOTHER PLAYER -- MICKEY MCFEE, 23, black. Smoking a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette. He snuffs out his cigarette and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team, as -- EBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway. Larry and Skip encourage their players running onto the field. Ebby is trying to get the zipper on his fly unstuck. He smiles broadly at Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove.
C: EBBY
D: I'm there, Skip, I'm ready.

S: INT. THE PRESS BOX
N: THE RADIO ANNOUNCER, TEDDY CULLINANE, 50, leans into the radio mike of a very small local station. Next to him is the local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40. Between them they've seen a million minor league players come and go.
C: WHITEY
D: Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred grand? I hear he's a quart low?
C: TEDDY THE RADIO MAN
D: He's left handed. Whattya expect? The Bulls are off to a slow start having dropped their first three games, but hope to turn it around tonight with the professional debut of the heralded young left hander, Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox is leadoff hitter Willie Foster

S: EXT. THE BALLFIELD -- NIGHT
N: ANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for wisdom and insight.
C: ANNIE
D: -- Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble.
C: MILLIE
D: I got lured.
C: ANNIE
D: You didn't get "lured". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it -- "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
C: MILLIE
D: "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
C: ANNIE
D: That's better. Got the radar ready?
E: to Jackson
C: JACKSON
D: Ready.
N: JACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate. THE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in. TEDDY THE RADIO MAN (V.O.) The word on LaLoosh is that the good looking young lefty has a major league fastball but sometimes has problems with his control. EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires. The pitch sails over the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop, and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX.

C: CATCHER
D: What?
C: EBBY
D: Who's the beef sitting behind the third base dugout?
C: CATCHER

C: JACKSON
D: What's it say?
C: ANNIE
D: It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
N: JACKSON RUNS OFF with the note. Annie turns to Millie.

BILL HALEY AND HIS COMETS When the chimes ring five, six and seven -- We'll be right in Seventh Heaven, Gonna rock around the clock tonight... EBBY UNLEASHES A WILD ONE -- And decks the Bull Mascot. EBBY IN THE DUGOUT READS THE NOTE from Annie. EBBY STRIKES OUT a Peninsula batter. EBBY UNLEASHES ANOTHER WILD ONE and a batter hits the dirt. End "Rock Around the Clock" and --

D: League record. And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice -- also league records -- Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
E: beat beat
N: THE DOOR OPENS -- A PLAYER ENTERS, in street clothes, carrying his suitcases. CRASH DAVIS, 30, older than the other players. And different. More than just opinions, he actually has a point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the world without baseball. Also unlike Ebby -- he loves baseball desperately.
C: LARRY
D: Who're you?
N: Crash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride, like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun.
C: CRASH
D: I am the player to be named later.
N: Beat. Skip looks out, half dressed, from his cubicle.
C: SKIP
D: Crash Davis?
C: CRASH
D: The Crash Davis. And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3 -- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
E: beat, then nonstop

D: Oh yeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya?
E: remembering
C: SKIP
D: I'm Joe Riggins. Sit down

E: beat
C: LARRY
D: He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
C: SKIP
D: -- we had the gun on him tonight -- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97. He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
E: beat
C: LARRY
D: But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...

D: You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes -- We want you to mature the kid.
E: beat
C: CRASH
D: "Mature" ain't a fuckin' verb.

C: SKIP
D: Even if it's the Carolina League -- this is a chance to play everyday.
C: CRASH
D: You don't want a player, you want a stable pony. My Triple A contract gets bought out so I can hold the Flavor o' the Month's dick in the bus leagues?! Fuck this fucking game... I fuckin' quit.
E: angrily angrily
N: CRASH RISES TO LEAVE -- Picks up his luggage, and turns to Skip and Larry before exiting. A deep breath
C: CRASH
D: Who we play tomorrow?
N: Beat. They know, they share the inability to quit the game. They're all clinging to the Church of Baseball.

C: ED
D: You wanted to see me?
C: SKIP
D: Yeah, Ed, shut the door...
N: He does. Remains standing. He can see it coming.
C: SKIP
D: This is the toughest job a manager has, Ed... But the organization has decided to make a change -- we're releasing you from your contract...
E: deep breath

S: INT. THE LOCKER ROOM --
N: CRASH PUTS HIS BAG IN A LOCKER as other players return from the shower. Crash watches as EBBY SOAKS HIS ELBOW IN A TUB OF ICE WATER as the sports writer, Whitey, interviews him.
C: WHITEY
D: How's it feel to get your first professional win?
C: EBBY
D: It feels "out there". A major rush. I mean it doesn't just feel "out there" but it feels out there.

D: Hi, I'm Millie.
C: TONY
D: I'm Tony. I play left field.
C: MILLIE
D: I know.
N: ANNIE SITS IN THE CORNER at her own table. Max Patkin, looking spiffy in a turtle neck sweater and double breasted blazer, sits down next to her. Old friends.
C: MAX
D: Love the game, Annie, love it When I die I'm gonna have my ashes sprinkled around a pitcher's mound in some ballpark somewhere -- -- and I'll have a few ashes saved for the rosin bag so I'll still be in the game after I'm gone.

C: CRASH
D: I don't dance.
C: ANNIE
D: I don't trust a man who don't dance. It ain't natural.
N: SUDDENLY -- HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL on the juke box. Several couples dance, and out of the pack -- EBBY DANCES WITH A GROUPIE -- Spinning and whirling, uninhibited and infectious. He's suddenly dancing with a different WOMAN, then another, and another... ANNIE, CRASH AND MAX WATCH the mad performance.
C: MAX
D: Who's he dancing with?
C: ANNIE
D: All of 'em, I think...
N: EBBY PUTS ON A ONE MAN SHOW ON THE DANCE FLOOR -- The whole bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish. A quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show. More naive, fun. He climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table.
C: EBBY
D: Thanks for the note -- you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
C: ANNIE
D: You got a live arm there.
N: He extends his hand to introduce himself.

D: Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
C: EBBY
D: No way.
C: CRASH
D: C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh. C'mon, Rook -- show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head --
E: teasing mercilessly
N: EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away, right at Crash's chest. But, alas -- THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance. Crash never blinks.
C: CRASH
D: Ball four.
N: EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.
C: EBBY
D: Who the fuck are you?!
N: CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed, effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there stunned. He looks up.

N: THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles. EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men look around the room with wonder. Ebby is clearly more nervous than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor league career.
C: ANNIE
D: These are the ground rules. I hook up with one guy a season -- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring training... And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. So... I thought we should get to know each other.
E: beat beat beat
C: CRASH
D: Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose?
C: ANNIE
D: Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
C: EBBY
D: Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
C: ANNIE
D: You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey -- slow down.
N: Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.
C: CRASH
D: After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart... or loins.
C: ANNIE
D: What do you believe in?
E: challenging him
N: Crash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting. He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:
C: CRASH
D: I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
E: beat
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my... Don't leave...
E: breathless softly
C: CRASH
D: G'night.
N: Crash heads out into the night. Annie hurries to the-door while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered.
C: EBBY
D: Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff?
N: ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch.
C: ANNIE
D: Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
C: CRASH
D: I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm not interested yet.
N: Ebby appears in the door.
C: EBBY
D: Who you calling a "boy"?
C: CRASH
D: See ya at the yard, Meat.
N: Crash walks out into the Durham night. Ebby and Annie stand in the doorway. She speaks softly to Ebby.
C: ANNIE
D: No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
C: EBBY
D: Well shit, then, let's fuck.

N: ANNIE PUTS ON A RECORD -- Edith Piaf sings "Le Trois Cloches". EBBY STARTS UNDRESSING across the room.
C: ANNIE
D: Wait, honey, slow down -- I want to watch.
N: She sits in a chair. Piaf sings. Ebby practically rips his shirt off, exposing a great upper body.
C: ANNIE
D: No, no, no. Put it back on and take it off slowly.
C: EBBY
D: Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
C: ANNIE
D: When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch. Shh. I love this part.
E: turning to the stereo
N: Piaf sings. Annie listens. Ebby re-buttons, then unbuttons his shirt. It drops, revealing his back.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my -- what a nice back.
N: Ebby drops his pants.
C: ANNIE
D: No, no, honey... first the shoes and socks.
C: EBBY
D: The socks? It's cold in here.
C: ANNIE
D: You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
E: sweetly, unthreatening
N: Ebby considers this. Pulls his pants back up. Takes his socks off. Then his pants.
C: ANNIE
D: Ebby honey have you ever been handcuffed in bed?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT
N: Deserted streets of the old tobacco town. Crash walks alone. He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can. He stops in front of a store window. He rolls the newspaper like a short bat. He takes a batting stance, and -- CRASH TAKES HIS BATTING STANCE in front of the window, studying his reflection. He taken a "swing". And another. A GROUP OF OLD BLACK MEN stand in a doorway, watching.
T: CUT TO:

C: ANNIE
D: Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
C: EBBY
D: Who's he play for?
C: ANNIE
D: Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
C: EBBY
D: Never heard of 'em.

D: Good -- then listen. "I sing the body electric. The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them -- "
E: reading

E: a few heads turn

D: I don't care If you think I'm square but I believe what I believe.
N: All heads turn as: EBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed.
C: BOBBY
D: Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over you?
C: EBBY
D: Call me "Nuke". Annie said it's my new nickname.
E: glassy eyed
N: Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse.
C: DEKE
D: Annie nailed you? That's great, means you're gonna have a helluva year. Does she fuck as good as they say?
C: EBBY
D: We didn't do it, man -- she read poetry to me all night, I swear. It's more tiring than fucking.
N: EBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing. Crash sits next to him, looking straight ahead. Bobby nearby.
C: EBBY
D: -- of love"... hey, Crash, does that mean what I think it means? What's the deal here?
N: Crash studies Ebby.
C: CRASH
D: Your shower shoes have fungus on 'em. You'll never get to the Bigs with fungus on your shower shoes. Think classy and you'll be classy. If you win 20 in the Show you can let the fungus grow back on your shower shoes and the press'll think you're colorful. Until you win twenty in the Show, however, it means you're a slob.

C: CRASH
D: You ain't getting that cheese by me, meat.
N: CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still.
C: CRASH
D: Look for the fastball up. He's gotta come with the cheese. Relax. Relax. Quick bat. Pop the clubhead. Open the hips. Relax. You're thinking too much. Get outta your fuckin' head, Crash.
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused. CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup.

C: BAT BOY
D: From Annie.
C: CRASH
D: Read it.
C: BAT BOY
D: Dear Crash. You have a lovely swing but you're pulling your hips out too early. I'd be happy to meet you at the Batting Cage tomorrow to discuss it. Signed, Annie.
C: DEKE
D: Well if there's one chick'd know when you're pulling your hips out early, Annie's the one.
N: Crash doesn't seem too amused. He grabs the note, and the pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout wall. He scrawls a quick note.
T: CUT TO:
N: ANNIE'S PRIVATE BOX -- She's watching the players through binoculars as Jackson returns with the note.
C: ANNIE

E: looking through the glasses

C: ANNIE
D: See my hips?
C: CRASH
D: Yep.
C: ANNIE
D: I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
C: CRASH
D: When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting. But you shouldn't think about it too much. The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
E: beat
C: ANNIE
D: But you were pulling your hips last night.
C: CRASH
D: So... Wanta make love?
N: ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES the next pitch.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm committed to Nuke for the season. You had your chance the other night.
C: CRASH
D: What'you see in that guy -- he's dim, pretty boy. A young, wild...
C: ANNIE
D: Young men are uncomplicated. And he's not "dim". He's just inexperienced. My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
E: Crash mutters
C: CRASH
D: That's my job too.
N: ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch.
C: ANNIE
D: Damn.
C: CRASH
D: You're pulling your hips out.
C: ANNIE
D: But they're nice hips. I looked up your records -- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
E: beat
N: ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely.
C: CRASH
D: Don't tell anybody.
C: ANNIE
D: Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's...
C: CRASH
D: 247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
C: CRASH
D: No. Please.
N: ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one.
C: ANNIE
D: Damn.
C: CRASH
D: Let me.
N: CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The pitch comes. Crash drills it.
C: CRASH
D: Your place or mine?
C: ANNIE
D: Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao- Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
C: CRASH
D: Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around -- Great deal. You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing -- So what do you really want? You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic? Or do you want a guy?
E: whack -- a line drive whack -- a line drive whack -- a line drive
N: The pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence.
C: ANNIE

E: as he signs autographs
C: ANNIE
D: You got me all confused.
C: CRASH
D: A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing --
C: ANNIE
D: I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman.
C: LITTLE LEAGUER
D: Hey, when are you guys gonna start winning? You're terrible!
C: ANNIE
D: It's a long season, boys.
N: SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.
C: NUKE
D: Hey! What're you guys doing here -- stealing my girl?
E: coming over
C: CRASH
D: Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that? Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
E: to the little leaguers
C: LITTLE LEAGUERS
D: It's Nuke, it's Nuke! Can I have your autograph?! Etc.
C: NUKE

C: NUKE
D: You said "Crash".
C: ANNIE
D: Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
C: NUKE
D: You said "Crash".
C: ANNIE
D: Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
N: Nuke considers this fabulous logic.
C: NUKE
D: Yeah maybe you're right.
C: ANNIE
D: You see how nice things are when we go slow?
N: Nuke sighs; and lets his head sink in the pillow.
C: NUKE
D: Mmm, hmmm. You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off. When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life. He likes baseball more than I do...
E: beat beat
C: ANNIE
D: You can learn to like it.
C: NUKE
D: I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
C: ANNIE
D: Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever. Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.

D: God, I never thought of that.
C: ANNIE
D: There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie -- now get some rest for tonight's game.

D: Face is "skin to skin". Skin starts with "S". "S" stands for steal if it follows the indicator which is hand to eye 'cause the word "indicator" starts with an "I" so I figure "eye" -- -- would remind you of "I" for indicator to indicate that what follows is the sign.

C: ANNIE
D: I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
C: NUKE
D: What?
C: ANNIE
D: They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently -- plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
C: NUKE
D: Jesus, Annie, I don't know --
C: ANNIE
D: You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side.
C: NUKE
D: Big League pitchers don't use these.

S: EXT. HIGHWAY THROUGH THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS - EARLY MORNING
N: THE TEAM BUS ROLLS through the North Carolina landscape.
C: ANNIE
D: This sort of spiritual awareness can be a mixed blessing, especially if you're dating a ballplayer. I believe a woman oughta take care of her man so thoroughly that he can go on the road for a few days without having the desire to search out another pair of panties That is probably, however, my most ridiculous belief. I just hope the boys start winning soon. In some profound way I fear that a last place team is a reflection on its women...

DEKE TURNS HIS VOLUME LOUDER -- Mickey does likewise, and soon we have DUELING TAPE DECKS. C & W going head to head with R & B. A cacophony. SKIP LEAPS TO HIS FEET, WHIRLS and shouts.
C: SKIP
D: I got one word to say to you -- Shut up!
N: Silence. And then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but slightly dissonant guitar chords. THE BACK OF THE BUS -- Nuke sits across the aisle from Crash, who's re-reading Thomas Pynchon. Nuke has a guitar and is struggling with some chords to "Try a Little Tenderness". He butchers the chords and the words.
C: NUKE
D: Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
E: singing softly
C: CRASH
D: Gimme that.
E: in disgust
N: CRASH STRONGARMS THE GUITAR from Nuke.

C: NUKE

E: beat
C: NUKE
D: What do I got?
C: CRASH
D: A gift. When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
N: Nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously.
C: CRASH
D: You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
C: NUKE
D: I ain't pissing nothing away -- I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
C: CRASH
D: You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt -- you need a curve ball. In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
E: beat
C: NUKE
D: You been in the Majors?
C: CRASH
D: Yep.
N: Tony and Deke overhear this and turn around. And Crash gets wistful, lyrical, and even slightly hopeful.
C: CRASH
D: I was in the Show for 21 days, once. It was the greatest 21 days of my life. You never touch your luggage in the show -- somebody else handles your bags. It's great. The ballparks are like cathedrals, the hotels all have room service, the women have long legs and brains -- it's a smorgasbord.
E: beat beat
C: DEKE
D: The women are hot, eh?
C: CRASH
D: Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. They throw ungodly breaking stuff in the Show -- exploding sliders.
N: Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement.
C: CRASH
D: You could be one of those guys -- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
C: NUKE
D: God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"! You wanta step outside!
N: CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing Nuke by the collar.
C: CRASH
D: Yeah, let's go.
N: Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying.
C: NUKE
D: No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash...
N: Nuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting nearby. He hands the ball to Crash.
C: NUKE
D: Teach me how to throw a breaking ball.
N: Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly:
C: CRASH
D: As I was saying ya hold it like an egg.
N: As the bus rolls through the country: A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks.

CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT". TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes cued up. A crowd roars.

THE TEAM BUS PULLS INTO YET ANOTHER HOTEL and this time, a Bus with a sign -- "Holiday on Ice" pulls in next to them.

D: Wake up, it's okay... you're dreaming...
N: CRASH HELPS NUKE back to consciousness. Nuke shakes his head, trying to wake up. Crash is almost tender.
C: NUKE
D: I was playing naked.
C: CRASH
D: I know, I know -- I have that dream all the time. We're almost home.
N: The Bus continues across the Carolina landscape.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN
N: The team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot. A few of the players' cars are parked. Some of the wives and girlfriends. And Annie. THE PLAYERS SHUFFLE OFF the bus. Tired and beat. CLOSE ON NUKE -- He looks worse than the rest. He sees Annie and waves. She's waiting next to her old Volvo.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM MOMENTS LATER
N: ANNIE'S VOLVO PULLS OUT -- She drives.
S: INT. THE VOLVO -- DAY
N: Annie is up -- Nuke is down.
C: NUKE
D: God I'm tired. What a trip I was lousy. I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched -- it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom. I --
C: ANNIE
D: What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me? Don't I look nice?
C: NUKE
D: Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.
C: ANNIE
D: Good. Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous. Let's play catch.
E: beat
C: NUKE
D: Catch?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ANNIE'S BACKYARD -- MORNING
N: Flowers and birdfeeders everywhere. And, 60 feet away in complete, oversized catcher's gear -- JACKSON IN A CATCHER'S CROUCH -- Nuke stares, in his street clothes, but now with a glove and ball.
C: JACKSON
D: Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
C: ANNIE
D: That's not necessary, Jackson -- Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
E: beat
N: He does. Jackson flashes some ridiculous signs.
C: NUKE
D: This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.
C: ANNIE
D: Just do what I say. Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
C: NUKE
D: Which nostril am I breathing through?
N: Annie puts her hand under his nose.
C: ANNIE
D: The right nostril. Good.
C: NUKE
D: My right nostril?
C: ANNIE
D: There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida". The pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril.
E: or left ovary of the female
N: She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of fact manner. He stares back.
C: ANNIE
D: The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
E: or ovary
C: NUKE
D: I'm really beat. I need some serious "z's" --
C: ANNIE
D: The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball. And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
E: beat
C: NUKE
D: Switch nostrils?
C: ANNIE
D: Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.
N: NUKE TOSSES AN EASY PITCH to Jackson. Annie's incensed.
C: ANNIE
D: You're patronizing me! I will not be patronized --
C: NUKE
D: If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
C: ANNIE
D: He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
N: Nuke gets a little steamed. He feels his nostril, winds, and fires a medium speed fastball to Jackson.
C: NUKE
D: How was that?
E: a bit angry
C: ANNIE
D: A little better.
C: NUKE
D: Gimme the God damn ball!
N: NUKE WINDS UP and fires a pitch to Jackson. Alas -- THE BALL SAILS THROUGH A WINDOW -- Crashing glass.
C: NUKE
D: How ya like that?
E: cynically
C: ANNIE
D: Much better. Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me. This is progress.
E: beat
N: Nuke smiles and gives in. And reaches for her.
C: NUKE
D: I give up. Let's go inside, make love, and fall asleep till it's time to go to the ballpark.
N: She takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch.
C: ANNIE
D: Or... ...We could just take that sexual energy and save it for a few hours and re-channel it into your pitching tonight. C'mon, Jackson, I've got some lemonade!
E: taking his hand shouting
N: Jackson runs over in full gear to join them. SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH -- A pitcher of lemonade.
C: NUKE
D: I can't keep up with you. First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher -- now no sex is gonna do it?!
C: ANNIE
D: It's all the same thing.
N: SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.
C: NUKE
D: What's that?!
N: -- P.O.V. A CARDBOARD BOX ON A TABLE NEARBY -- Scrawled in larged letters on the side are the words "MAX PATKIN".
C: ANNIE
D: That's Max. His ashes anyway. He left no kin...
E: matter of factly
N: Nuke stares, unsettled.
C: NUKE
D: God... I think I'm gonna be sick --
C: ANNIE
D: Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing to be scared of. It's just another way of living. It's just a fresh start -- kinda like spring training.
N: Nuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.
C: NUKE
D: Death is like spring training?
C: ANNIE
D: Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke -- You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
E: sweetly accusing him
N: CLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT
N: NUKE PULLS HIS JOCKSTRAP ON over the red panties. Crash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband.
C: CRASH
D: Hot. Very hot...
N: Nuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly.
C: NUKE
D: Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers. She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
C: CRASH
D: Annie's a smart lady.
N: Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties.
C: DEKE
D: Hey, fruit alert! Check out the Rook.
N: SEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke as the players are dressing into their uniforms.
C: NUKE
D: Annie says there's no such thing as straight and gay. We're all sexual creatures to start with, and we get formed into certain roles.
C: TOMMY
D: You believe that?
C: NUKE
D: When I'm one and six I'll believe anything. Annie also says that God is a woman. You believe that, Crash, you think God's a lady?
E: as they dress
C: CRASH
D: God's definitely a woman -- but she's no lady.
C: TOMMY
D: This is all Commie bullshit. God has a dick, man.
E: beat
C: TONY
D: God damn it, Jimmy, you're an expert -- does God have a dick or a pussy?
N: JIMMY TURNS FROM HIS CUBICLE to answer the theological question. Ll heads wait for the answer.
C: JIMMY
D: The Lord God is tri-une -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
C: TOMMY
D: Father and Son. Awright!
N: The guys slap fives, convinced God is a man.
C: MICKEY
D: Yeah, but He is a brother.
E: baiting them
C: TOMMY
D: Bullshit! God ain't no brother!
N: Deke turns to Crash, full of despair.
C: DEKE
D: If there is a God, why am I hitting .200?
N: SUDDENLY SKIP AND LARRY APPEAR to restore order.
C: SKIP
D: Shut up! This is a damn noisy clubhouse for a team that's lost 15 straight.
N: Silence. Skip takes off his cap -- instantly sincere.
C: SKIP
D: Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
C: LARRY
D: ...and one helluva guy.

N: ANNIE SPRINKLES MAX'S ASHES on the pitcher's mound, as: JACKSON SITS IN THE DUGOUT FILLING ROSIN BAGS with the extra ashes from a box. EXTREME CLOSE UP -- A ROSIN BAG MARKED "MAX"
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: EXTREME CLOSE UP -- "MAX" ROSIN BAG on the mound.
S: EXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- NIGHT
N: NUKE ON THE MOUND -- PICKS UP the rosin bag, and paces. A small crowd. A batter steps in to hit. Nuke looks in for the sign.

D: Fastball again? Why's he want the heat -- I just threw heat. Don't think, Meat -- give 'em the gas.
N: NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- An eye-popping fastball. The batter swings and misses. Strike three.
T: CUT TO:
N: IN THE DUGOUT -- SKIP AND LARRY LOOK AT EACH other warily.

N: NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS A VICIOUS CURVEBALL -- A check swing dribbler to first for the third out. And the players run into the dugout.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE DUGOUT
N: NUKE PUTS ON HIS WARM UP JACKET and sits down next to Crash, who's taking off his gear, readying to hit.
C: NUKE
D: I was great, eh?
C: CRASH
D: Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging -- in the Show they woulda ripped you.
C: NUKE
D: Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
C: CRASH
D: The moment's over. If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown --
E: rising to get a bat
N: CRASH SMILES in his disarming way, and grabs a bat.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE ON DECK CIRCLE
N: Crash kneels, rubbing the bat handle with pine tar. He studies the pitcher working the first two hitters. CRASH RISES and heads to the plate. CRASH STEPS INTO THE BOX -- Digs in.
C: CRASH
D: I dare you to throw me the hammer -- you ain't that stupid...
N: CRASH'S P.O.V. IN SLOW-MOTION -- The pitcher winds and delivers. And as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand--
C: CRASH
D: Breaking ball -- you fool!
N: CRASH UNLOADS ON THE PITCH -- Crushing a home run deep over the left field wall.
T: DISSOLVE TO:

C: CRASH
D: I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
C: NUKE
D: Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.

T: CUT TO:
N: NUKE'S NEXT DELIVERY -- A wild ass rocket thirty feet off line. The BULL MASCOT DIVES for cover. THE BATTER STEPS OUT OF THE BOX nervously, muttering.
C: BATTER
D: This guy's crazy.
C: CRASH
D: Yep. Next one might be at your head. Hell if I know where the damn thing's going...
N: CLOSE ON NUKE -- Smiles. Winds. Delivers. A change up. THE BATTER SWINGS TERRIBLY OFF STRIDE -- Strike three. Crash whips the ball around the infield.

C: CRASH
D: This son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and he's shaking me off?! Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce.
E: to batter and umpire
N: NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- A hanging curveball. The batter takes an ungodly cut, and BLASTS a long home. THE BATTER STANDS AT THE PLATE watching the blast... until CRASH SHOVES HIM toward first with a sneer. For a moment it looks like there'll be a fight -- but the hitter backs off and takes the home run trot as: NUKE STARES AT THE OUTFIELD WALL as the batter circles the bases. Crash walks to the mound.
C: NUKE
D: You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
C: CRASH
D: Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet... damn...

D: Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
C: ANNIE
D: Breathing through your pingala always works, honey --
C: NUKE
D: Not that. I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
E: beat
C: ANNIE
D: Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
N: She strikes a pose. She does look hot.
C: NUKE
D: You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter? We better not fuck.

C: ANNIE
D: Nuke was so encouraged that he took a vow to not have sex until they lost...
E: V.O.
N: Annie reaches over, opens a drawer in her nightstand, and pulls out her baseball glove. She cradles it fondly in her lap, puts it on, pounds it gently...

E: V.O.
N: NUKE WARMING UP in the bullpen, listening to Crash.

N: Nuke looks up from his clichés, startled.

D: She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy -- maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down. What'ya think?

C: ANNIE
D: Yes I do...
C: NUKE
D: Well -- he calls it the Bermuda Triangle. He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
C: ANNIE
D: What a nasty thing to say.
C: NUKE
D: He didn't mean it nasty. He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do -- especially like that.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh... Crash is a very smart man. Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
E: beat
N: NUKE REACHES FOR THE GARTER SNAPS with two hands. He fumbles, groping awkwardly. Annie stops him gently.

D: Mmmmmmm... oh yes...
E: sighing sexually
N: BUT NUKE LEAPS TO HIS FEET -- Reacting vigorously, nervously, desperately. The soup crashes on the floor.
C: NUKE
D: No! You're playing with my mind!
C: ANNIE
D: I'm trying to play with your body!
C: NUKE
D: I knew it -- you're seducing me!

C: NUKE
D: You're exotic and mysterious and cute -- that's why I better leave.
N: Nuke starts to leave.
C: ANNIE
D: Nuke! You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball. Ask Crash.
C: NUKE
D: I did.
C: ANNIE
D: What'd he say?
C: NUKE
D: He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.

D: He's confused --
C: CRASH
D: Aren't we all?
C: ANNIE
D: Don't you think I'm pretty?
N: Crash puts down the bat, and looks directly at her. As he does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins pumping them an he talks.
C: CRASH
D: You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you. I had to have you!
C: ANNIE
D: I want to be had.
C: CRASH
D: I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
C: ANNIE
D: He won't make love to me anymore.
C: CRASH
D: And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties -- then you are! And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
E: beat beat
C: ANNIE
D: I want you desperately!
N: Crash can hardly keep up. So he slows her down --
C: CRASH
D: Who are you? Do you have a job?
C: ANNIE
D: I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me.

D: Who?
C: ANNIE
D: Thurman Munson. He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody -- it was beautiful...

D: What's so great about baseball?
C: ANNIE

SEVERAL HOOKERS in various stages of undress, sit on couches and chairs. Bored, smoking, ancient. The ONE WHITE HOOKER, a skinny 25 year old, accompanies on a guitar, struggling to keep up. And a couple HOOKERS are hanging around a piano that -- CRASH IS PLAYING and singing. He doesn't look up. Crash is dressed but barefoot. A cigarette dangles from his mouth as he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords. Two Hookers at the piano hum along.
C: CRASH
D: But when she does get weary -- Try a little tenderness...
E: singing and playing
N: NUKE STEPS INTO THE ROOM -- All the Hookers rise in anticipation of a new customer. Crash keeps playing, never looking up.

D: ...God damn... I forgot my fucking shoes. Honey, go get my shoes.
N: One of the Hookers goes inside for his shoes.
C: NUKE
D: I'll take you back to the hotel.
C: CRASH
D: You know what the difference is between hitting .250 and hitting .300? I got it figured out. Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks -- you get one extra flare a week -- just one -- a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail -- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!

C: CRASH
D: Nuke... tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left?
C: NUKE
D: My right.
N: Silence. Crash's next line is both drunk and sober and we don't know if he's just being clever or if, somehow, he's staged It all. Maybe even he doesn't know.
C: CRASH
D: Good. Good. That's terrific...
C: NUKE

S: EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Ninth inning. Durham is leading by a score of 1 to 0. Two outs. JIMMY IS PITCHING -- He delivers. The batter rockets a line drive up the alley. A PENINSULA RUNNER races from first, rounding third, trying to score. A relay. CRASH WAITS AT THE PLATE -- Here comes the runner. Here comes the throw. A close play. A terrible collision. Crash goes rolling. The umpire waits -- and in a cloud of dust, Crash holds up the ball. THE CROWD ROARS -- Jimmy jumps victoriously in the air.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT
N: The air of victory. The mood is up and goofy. Beer cans are squirted at Jimmy, the groom.
C: JIMMY
D: I wanta thank everybody and the Lord for the victory, it's a wonderful way to celebrate my marriage -- and I guess we're all back on a winning streak, he? A few raucous "Fuckin A's" from the team.
C: TONY
D: Hey, Jimmy -- we chipped in and kind got a little gift for ya of a special wedding cake from the Durham Bulls.
N: DEKE CARRIES OUT AN WEDDING CAKE -- It's X-Rated. The decorative Bride and Groom are fucking. Jimmy's embarrassed but it's all good natured.
T: CUT TO:
N: CRASH COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER -- Toweling off, watching the innocent, vulgar fun. He sits down in front of his locker, drying his hair, when the CLUBHOUSE BOY approaches:
C: CLUBHOUSE BOY
D: Hey, Crash -- Skip wants to see ya.
N: CRASH RISES AND HEADS FOR SKIP'S CUBICLE -- Wearing only a towel and his shower shoes.
T: CUT TO:
N: INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed. CRASH ENTERS as he's still drying off.
C: CRASH
D: Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
C: SKIP
D: Crash, shut the door.
N: And it hits him. Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who also looks away nervously. CRASH SHUTS THE DOOR -- The party rages beyond.
C: SKIP
D: This is the toughest job a manager has...
E: heartfelt
N: CLOSE ON CRASH -- He's been in the game too long to be surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised. And hurt. His stoicism is professional.
C: SKIP
D: The organization wants to make a change... now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
C: LARRY
D: Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg... probably a bust.
C: SKIP
D: I put in a word for you with the organization -- told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday... Might be an opening at Salem next year --
N: EXTREME CLOSE UP ON CRASH -- His eyes are moist.
C: SKIP
D: Helluva year, Crash -- you know how it is.
N: Silence. Crash stands there nearly nude. He just nods slightly. Without rancor or bitterness, he turns and re-enters the raucous locker room.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT
N: CRASH WALKS THE STREETS ALONE -- Crash stops in front of a window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection. AND HE KEEPS WALKING INTO:

N: CRASH DRINKING ALONE at the end of a bar.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT
N: CRASH WANDERS ALONG into the residential neighborhoods. HE STARTS ACROSS A QUIET INTERSECTION Stops. Looks at the street signs. He CHANGES DIRECTION, walks on.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: The windows glow. After midnight. CRASH STARES AT THE HOUSE -- Hesitates, then walks up the porch stairs. Knocks at the door. Moments later: ANNIE OPENS THE DOOR -- She looks beautiful. Almost as if she was expecting him. At first, silence. Then:
C: CRASH
D: I got released.
C: ANNIE
D: I heard already.
N: SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- Crash enters Annie's house.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
N: ANNIE PUTS ON her favorite Piaf record. ANNIE POURS A DRINK for both of them. CRASH PUTS A HAND ON HER HIP -- Annie closes her eyes, a tiny gasp. He kisses her forehead. She kisses his neck. A tiny smile from Crash. The same from Annie. SHE KISSES HIM on the corner of his mouth. Her hand finds the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his hair. CRASH RESPONDS -- They kiss slowly, deeply. As -- HIS HAND ON HER HIP PULLS UP HER SKIRT -- By degrees, the skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg. At last exposing the beloved BLACK GARTER SNAPS -- Crash's hand expertly holds up the skirt and effortlessly UNSNAPS THE GARTER with a minimum of effort. FLICK, FLICK, FLICK -- The garter snaps are free.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE BEDROOM -- Crash carries Annie to the bed.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE'S FOOT KICKS OVER A LAMP onto the floor.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE'S BLOUSE FRONT -- Flick, flick, flick. Crash unbuttons it with one hand in seconds. Even Annie is startled with the speed and ease of Crash's hand.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: HER HAND SLIDES UNDER THE WAISTBAND of his underwear
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: HIS HAND SLIDES UP UNDER HER panties.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A FULL EMBRACE ON THE EDGE OF THE BED -- Remnants of clothes cover parts of their bodies. They tumble out of control to the floor.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE'S HAND GRABS ONTO A DRESSER LEG -- A carved oak antique, her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE DRESSER TOP SHAKES -- Makeup bottles and pictures and dozens of Annie's special things rattle and fall
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE'S READ RESTS ON CRASH'S STOMACH -- Post coital, they lie on the floor blissfully as Piaf finishes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE CHANGES THE RECORD to Hank Williams.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE KITCHEN -- ANNIE AND CRASH eat an after mid after sex snack. Crash eats a bowl of Wheaties. They each wear one of her robes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Annie sits, munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana she keeps in a Victorian jewel box.
C: ANNIE
D: ...so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
C: CRASH
D: How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous? How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
E: beat
C: ANNIE
D: It doesn't work like that. God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance?
E: stares at him
N: THEY KISS AGAIN -- And fall gradually onto the table top.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE SITS ON TOP OF CRASH lying on the kitchen table. He stretches out a leg and: KICKS THE BOWL OF CEREAL to the floor. It smashes -- ceramics, milk, cereal go everywhere. As: THEY START MAKING LOVE AGAIN in the glaring kitchen light.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CRASH AND ANNIE DANCE in her living room.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE BEDROOM -- Crash is handcuffed to the bed. He seems perfectly happy as Annie reads Walt Whitman.
C: ANNIE
D: ...mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw hinges...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE HANDCUFFED TO THE BED -- Crash reads.
C: CRASH
D: ...wrist and wrist joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger, finger-joints, finger-nail...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CRASH AT ANNIE'S RECORD COLLECTION -- He thumbs through it quickly, puts on a new record. The Dominoes sing "Sixty Minute Man". And...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE BATHROOM -- Candlelight around the bathtub. All we can make out is two heads, two bodies, sloshing wildly In the dim glow. Water splashes, dowses some candles.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CRASH AND ANNIE IN BED READING -- Each with a copy of a Thomas Pynchon novel. Crash tosses it aside. And disappears under the sheets, playing with her as she struggles to keep reading. She puts down the book.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANNIE APPLYING EYE MAKEUP TO CRASH -- Who doesn't resist, seems even amused. He kisses her deeply, slowly. She kisses him back. They fall onto the bed.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: P.O.V. OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW -- Dawn. A bird chirps. And we hear a record skipping, repeating endlessly. PAN ACROSS THE KITCHEN -- Overturned chairs, spilled and broken cereal bowls, liquor bottles. PAN ACROSS THE BEDROOM -- A disaster. Clothes scattered across the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed angle. Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly spent. CRASH WAKES UP SLOWLY -- Reaches up and pulls his underwear off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of bed. He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit, into: THE LIVING ROOM -- He stumbles across the trashed room. Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions, pictures hanging crookedly on the wall. CRASH TAKES THE SKIPPING RECORD off the player and breathes a sigh of relief. He sees his pants lying on the floor and pulls them on. CRASH OPENS A DRAWER -- Pulls out a piece of paper and a pencil. He starts writing...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. THE BEDROOM -- LATER
N: Sun streams in. Annie opens her eyes. Rubs them. Reaches over for Crash. Her hand hits a note. She whirls. He's gone. Only a note. SHE SITS UP WITH A START and reads the note.
C: ANNIE
D: Crash said he had to get an early start to drive to Asheville in the South Atlantic League where he heard they might need a catcher to finish out the season...
E: V.O.
N: ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NOTE -- "Love, Crash".

S: INT. ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY
N: ANNIE SCRUBBING HER KITCHEN FLOOR -- Down on her hands and knees, picking up the broken cereal bowl.
C: ANNIE
D: The house smelled like sex for days. It was wonderful. The only real cleaning I did was on the kitchen floor 'cause who likes to walk on spilt cereal?
E: V.O.
N: SHE FINDS A BIT OF A JOINT on the floor as she's cleaning. She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights the tiny joint.
C: ANNIE
D: The funny thing is, I stopped worrying about Nuke. Somehow I knew nothing would stop him. Crash was right -- Nuke had a gift.
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. INSIDE A MAJOR LEAGUE STADIUM (ATLANTA) -- DAY
N: NUKE IN STREET CLOTHES IN THE DUGOUT of an empty stadium. 50,000 seats. Slick. Awesome. He's being interviewed by a BIG LEAGUE REPORTER, who has a small tape deck and has stuck mike in Nuke's face.
C: NUKE
D: Y'know, I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub. I just want to give it my best shot and good Lord willing, things'll work out... gotta play 'em one day at a time, Y'know...
E: like a big leaguer
N: THE BIG LEAGUE REPORTER nods attentively as Nuke knowingly delivers the clichés like a veteran.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY
N: In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside. CRASH STEPS TO THE PLATE -- In a uniform we've never seen him in, of course. The Asheville Tourists. He picks up some dirt, rubs it on his hands. He's as intense as ever. Still playing for keeps.
C: CRASH
D: C'mon, Meat, throw me that weak ass shit -- c'mon, bring the heat, bring it, bring it...
E: at the plate
N: CRASH'S P.O.V. -- SLO-MO AS THE PITCHER WINDS AND delivers a fastball right down the pipe.

E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY
N: CRASH UNLOADS A MONSTROUS HOME RUN deep into the trees. He stands at home plate watching it... like Reggie or the Babe. And doesn't move. For several seconds he indulges himself uncharacteristically -- until... THE OPPOSING CATCHER SHOVES HIM toward first.
C: CATCHER
D: Get your ass in gear...
N: CRASH SMILES and takes the home run trot slowly. As he heads toward first, HE RAISES A CLINCHED FIST for a brief moment, a tiny gesture of triumph. And then, routinely, he just circles the bases. A HUNDRED FANS APPLAUD ROUTINELY as he circles the bases.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
N: SHE LIGHTS A CANDLE for the home run. Above the candles, displayed in the shrine, are her RED PANTIES.

E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- DAY
N: ANNIE AND JACKSON OPEN AN UMBRELLA in her familiar place in the stadium. Umbrellas go up all around, as: THE RAINS COME -- The players huddle-in the dugouts. IN THE DUGOUT Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric Yoga of Sex". And spitting tobacco.
C: ANNIE
D: The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement had a fastball that I coulda hit We had a three game lead with two weeks to go when the rains came.
E: V.O. beat
N: THE GROUND CREW DRAGS TARPS over the mound and the plate.
C: ANNIE
D: It rained and rained and I thought of driving down to Asheville to see Crash but then I thought "No, what you pursue, eludes you". I had to trust Quantum Physics and the Church of Baseball. It ain't always easy being this religious...
E: V.O. beat

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DURHAM NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

C: ANNIE
D: Oh my...
N: ANNIE SITS DOWN on the porch owing next to Crash.
C: ANNIE
D: What happened?
C: CRASH
D: I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
N: A moment of silence over the significance of him quitting.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.
C: CRASH
D: There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
C: ANNIE
D: Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were?
C: CRASH
D: Yeah... you a witch?
C: ANNIE
D: Not yet. It takes years of practice...
N: He smiles slightly and takes her hand.
C: CRASH
D: You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
C: ANNIE
D: You'd be great, just great... 'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an' all -- but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
E: rattling quickly
C: CRASH
D: Annie --
E: interrupting
C: ANNIE
D: What?
C: CRASH
D: I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em... but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics... I don't wanta think about nothing... I just wanta be.
E: beat

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY
N: THE SHRINE GLOWS -- Candles everywhere. Rain pours down on the windows outside. And... ANNIE AND CRASH SIT ON THE COUCH together, in silence.
C: ANNIE
D: Walt Whitman once said -- "I see great things in baseball. It's our game -- the American game He said "it will repair our losses and be a blessing to us"... You could look it up....
E: beat beat
N: The music -- Dave Frishberg sings "Van Lingle Mungo". THE END
