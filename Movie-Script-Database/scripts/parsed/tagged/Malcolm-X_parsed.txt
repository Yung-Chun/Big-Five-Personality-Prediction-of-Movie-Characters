T: FADE IN:
S: 1 EXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY
N: It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band. 2 OMIT 3 OMIT 4 OMIT
S: 5 EXT. STREET - DAY
N: FOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is not dissuaded.
S: 6 INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY
N: Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing being done just so, in time-honored fashion. He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar. He adds water and makes a paste of the starch. Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON) one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.
C: CHOLLY
D: After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good to me at all.
N: The men laugh. ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot. ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out.
C: CHOLLY'S VOICE
D: She says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap black sunovabitch to boot.
C: TOOMER
D: And when a black woman call you a cheap black sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black sunovabitch.
N: Cholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story.
C: CHOLLY
D: Will you let me tell it?
N: ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of rubber gloves.
C: SHORTY
D: Where's Homeboy?
N: He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts of an exasperating child.
C: CHOLLY
D: Red's in the head, man.
C: TOOMER
D: You mean hiding in the head.
C: CHOLLY
D: Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you.
N: His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes and an expression of apprehension.
C: TOOMER
D: Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, Homeboy?
C: CHOLLY
D: Man, don't scare him more than he's scared already. Ain't too bad...
N: Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding a protective collar of paper.
C: CHOLLY
D: ...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, Homeboy?
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM Malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a
T: kind of execution.
C: CHOLLY
D: Git his forehead and eyebrows.
C: SHORTY
D: I know what I'm doing.
N: Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area. Now he brings over the steaming jar and places it nearby. SHORTY (contd) Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a hole through cement.
C: CHOLLY
D: Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.
N: Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair. CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: I thought you said it was gonna sting... this ain't nothin'.
N: For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries to catch his breath: his head is on fire. MALCOLM (contd) You motherfucker. You're killing me. I'm burning up. My damn head is on fire. He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him. Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the congolene into his hair. Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his hair.
C: SHORTY
D: Don't fight me, man. Let me git it out.
N: Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting Malcolm and the shop in the process. 7 OMIT 8 OMIT
S: 9 INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
C: SHORTY
D: Well, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.
N: Shorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into the jacket... Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ...... dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.
C: SHORTY
D: Well, all right, then.
C: MALCOLM
D: Well, all reet, then.
N: The transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands.
S: 10 EXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY
N: Malcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked, zoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the lighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully aware of their impact. CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM FREEZE FRAME. He becomes a STILL.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: When my mother was pregnant with me, she told me later, a party of Klansmen on horseback surrounded our house in Omaha.
N: 10A ANGLE. KLAN on horses in front of house. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) They brandished guns and shouted for my father to come out. My mother went to the door where they could see her pregnant condition... ANGLE. A pregnant Louise Little on porch. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) ...and told them my father was in Milwaukee, preaching. ANGLE. The Klan breaks all the windows in the house then rides off into the glorious D.W. Griffith _Birth of a Nation_ moonlit night. CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) The hooded Klansman said the good, white Christians would not stand for his troublemaking, and to get out of town. ANGLE. The terrified Little children look out a broken window at their mother. ANGLE. AN OLD FRAME HOUSE IN OMAHA VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) They broke every window with their rifle butts before riding off into the night, their torches flaming. ANGLE. FRONT PORCH OF THE LITTLE HOUSE - AN EMPTY ROCKER ON IT VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) My father was not a frightened Negro as most were then and as many still are today. He was six feet four and very black... 10B CLOSE - EARL LITTLE He looks directly into the camera, wearing a Baptist Minister's robe. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) ...and had a glass eye. He believed, as did Marcus Garvey, that freedom, independence and self-respect could never be achieved by the Negro in America . . . 10C CLOSE - EARL LITTLE He wears a Garvey hat, ornate with gold braid. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) ...that, therefore, black men should leave America and return to the land of their origin. 10D ANGLE. Earl Little, in a wagon with little Malcolm. CLOSE - EARL LITTLE: VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) My father dedicated his life to his beliefs because he had seen four of his six brothers die violently... 10E WIDER ANGLE. WE SEE Earl in front of a podium in church. He is preaching. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) ...three killed by white men and one lynched. There are nine children in our family. ANGLE. The nine Little children. CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE She is a pretty, mature woman and white-looking. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) My mother was an attractive woman, an educated woman, a strong woman. 10F CLOSE - LOUISE AND EARL A posed wedding picture, serious but sweet. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) She was very light, her mama was raped by a white man. One of the reasons she married my father was because he was so black, she disliked her complexion and wanted her children to have some color. CLOSE SHOT Flash bulb of camera flashes. 11 OMIT 12 OMIT 13 OMIT 14 OMIT
S: 15 INT. ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY They both were posed for a picture. The music "FLYING HOME" is blaring as LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the dancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately BLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks. And Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed couples on the floor. A BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond hair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.
C: A VOICE
D: SHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!
N: ANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT People start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The music begins to get faster and more furious. CLOSE - HAMPTON'S BAND - NIGHT It is a fast Lindy. People start clapping to the beat as they form a U around the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.
S: 16 INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
N: TWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined by a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the main event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to get better vantage points and the competition is under way. ANGLE ON THE CROWD It is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, mostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of refinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch her eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one in particular, but nonetheless looking. ANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR Getting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. WIDER SHOT The music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more remarkable quality. FOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM He is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. He makes his way through the watching audience. CLOSE - LAURA She is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm approaching. TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.
C: MALCOLM
D: Come on, baby, let's show 'em how.
N: Laura smiles shyly; she's willing. MALCOLM (contd) You better get out of them shoes, girl. Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of sneakers.
S: 17 INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
N: Because of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping eagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect partner. She loves it. ANGLE WITH THE CROWD So does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go, man, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm." ANGLE: - SHORTY A big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides. TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp waves over. Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to his steps. Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and Malcolm go into a solo. ANGLES The crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous applause of the audience. CLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. CLOSE SHOT - SHORTY Waiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.
C: SHORTY
D: Hey, man, gimme some skin.
C: MALCOLM
D: Shorty, this is Laura.
N: Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.
C: LAURA
D: 'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
C: MALCOLM
D: Now you come back.
N: Laura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.
C: SHORTY
D: That's a fine chick.
C: MALCOLM
D: Fine as May wine.
C: SHORTY
D: Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
C: MALCOLM
D: Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
N: Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms. ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR Immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine steps. TWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock his black world. CLOSE - MALCOLM Trying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for it.
C: SOPHIA
D: Why don't you take your little girl home, Red, and come on back?
N: He stops in his tracks. He can't believe it. SOPHIA (contd) Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you get back. He can only grin.
S: 18 EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT
N: The porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get away.
C: MALCOLM
D: I better not come in.
C: LAURA
D: I ain't stupid.
C: MALCOLM
D: I mean it's late, baby.
C: LAURA
D: I know where you're going.
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
N: Laura walks to the door. MALCOLM (contd) Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
C: LAURA
D: What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
N: The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.
C: MALCOLM
D: 'Night, Mrs. Johnson.
N: He runs down the porch steps.
S: 19 INT. SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHT
N: The lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' "IF I DIDN'T CARE." ANGLE - SOPHIA Sophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe white breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might say Sophia was way ahead of her time.
C: SOPHIA
D: Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white breasts like these?
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM He shakes his head. SOPHIA (contd) Put your black hands on them. He is paralyzed. SOPHIA (contd) Please do as I say. Malcolm mumbles something. He then kisses Sophia as if his black life depended on it and he commences to kill it. SOPHIA (contd) Hey, baby. She stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck. SOPHIA (contd) Am I the first white woman you've been with? She already knows the answer. He laughs.
C: MALCOLM
D: Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
C: SOPHIA
D: ...That isn't a whore?
N: Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor. A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.
C: SOPHIA
D: That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
C: MALCOLM
D: Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
N: CLOSE - SOPHIA She shrugs, then moves to embrace him.
C: SOPHIA
D: Who wants to talk?
N: The couple starts at it again.
S: 19A INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
N: On the screen, Bogart and Cagney are blasting away the dirty, flat- footed coppers with machine guns. It's one of those great Warner Brothers gangster B movies, maybe _The Roaring Twenties_. ANGLE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY Malcolm and Shorty sit, transfixed in their seats.
C: MALCOLM
D: Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
C: SHORTY
D: Eat lead, coppers.
S: 80 EXT. BOSTON COMMONS - DAY
N: A bright, sunny day, long shadows in the park. The Commons is almost empty. Two improbable zoot-suited blacks race past trees, and run over the grass. Malcolm and Shorty are playing Cops and Robbers while PASSERSBY stare.
C: SHORTY
D: Bang, bang. You're dead.
C: MALCOLM
D: Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
N: Malcolm fires an imaginary tommy machine gun at Shorty.
C: SHORTY
D: I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
C: MALCOLM
D: The hell you are.
C: SHORTY
D: I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
C: MALCOLM
D: You're too small to be Bogart.
C: SHORTY
D: I'm not too short to be Cagney.
N: Shorty shoots Malcolm from behind. SHORTY (contd) Pow. Take that. Malcolm acts as if he's been hit.
C: MALCOLM
D: Ahhh! You got me, you dirty, filthy, rotten, stinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat bastard would shoot a man in the back.
N: Malcolm starts to stagger, this is a long drawn out Hollywood drawn-out death a la Cagney death in _Public Enemy_. LOW ANGLE - MALCOLM Malcolm falls directly into the camera, face first, and Shorty stands over him.
C: SHORTY
D: He use to be a big shot.
N: 21 OMIT 22 OMIT 23 OMIT 24 OMIT 25 OMIT
S: 26 EXT. THE TROLLEY TRACKS - NIGHT (REMEMBERED TIME)
T: MATCH CUT
N: CLOSE EARL LITTLE Earl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the previous scene. His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
S: 27 INT. A HEARING ROOM - DAY
N: A room, clinically empty; table, chair, and MR. HOLWAY. He is putting papers into his briefcase; the hearing is concluded.
C: LOUISE
D: What you mean took his own life?!
C: HOLWAY
D: I'm sorry, ma'am. You heard the verdict. A man bash in the back of his head with a hammer, lay down on the tracks and kill himself! We merely act on the verdict. We don't make them.
N: He is nearly out the door.
C: LOUISE
D: Do you pay or don't you?
C: HOLWAY
D: Read the policy, ma'am. It clearly states.
N: 28 OMIT
S: 29 INT. SOPHIA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

C: SOPHIA
D: You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
C: MALCOLM
D: C'mere.
N: WIDEN TO SHOW SOPHIA at the stove fixing eggs. She wears an apron and nothing else. It's a nicely furnished middle-class apartment.
C: SOPHIA
D: Sweetie, they're almost ready.
C: MALCOLM
D: You hear me, girl?
N: She shrugs, shuts off the burner, smiles and ambles toward him.
C: SOPHIA
D: You the man.
C: MALCOLM
D: You better believe it.
N: She starts to sit down on the bed next to him. MALCOLM (contd) Sit over there. He points to a nearby chair. Sophia makes an amiable hand-shrug and complacently goes.
C: SOPHIA
D: You evil this morning.
C: MALCOLM
D: What's your story, baby?
N: He doesn't want to hear her; he wants to talk. He goes right on: MALCOLM (contd) You one of them white bitches can't get enough black dick. Is that what you are? Sophia smiles. She aims to please. Malcolm smacks the bed next to him. She gets up and comes over. MALCOLM (contd) Take it off. She takes off the apron. MALCOLM (contd) Now kiss my feet. Kiss 'em! CLOSE - SOPHIA As Sophia bends to do so.
C: MALCOLM
D: Feed me.
N: ANGLE. Sophia now has the scrambled eggs on a plate at Malcolm's side. She spoons some into his mouth. He chews and swallows slowly, then grabs her head and brings it to his. A long, brutal kiss. Then he pulls her head away by the hair. She looks at him: anything he wants.
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
C: SOPHIA
D: Me?
C: MALCOLM
D: You will, baby -- if the time come.

C: MALCOLM
D: Sure wish your mama and papa could see you now. And that ofay you gonna marry.
S: 30 EXT. A BEACH - BRIGHT SUNLIGHT - DAY
N: Malcolm and Laura are on a deserted Cape beach. They are dressed but have their shoes and socks off, and he has his trousers rolled up. They walk, like birds, avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in.
C: LAURA
D: Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
C: MALCOLM
D: All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
C: LAURA
D: I do know I love you.
N: Laura stops him and moves to him. Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory. Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully. Her arms go around him as they both drop into the sand. CLOSE - MALCOLM AND LAURA
C: LAURA
D: Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one around. Now?
N: Malcolm turns his head from her, he gets up.
C: MALCOLM
D: Let's go.
C: LAURA
D: Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.

D: The word is excuse me.

TIGHT CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM'S FACE In the mirror (something satanic about him) -- as he sniffs the cocaine well into his nose.

S: 75 EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
N: A miserable night, raining and cold. Malcolm turns into the bar.
S: 76 INT. THE BAR - NIGHT
N: Shaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through. He is now a familiar figure to the bar's DENIZENS. He is met with ad lib cries: "Hey, Little," "Have a taste," from the men; and from the women: "Come here, sugar," "Where you been?" Malcolm acknowledges the greetings, strolls down in the bar. It's immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him. He is no longer the neophyte but a well-groomed, smooth, fully polished hustler. ANGLE - BOOTH Malcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress. ANGLE - HONEY A fine copper tan waitress comes to him.

C: A FEMALE VOICE
D: Daniel come in yet, Honey?
N: Malcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice. It's familiar, a sound from the seemingly distant past. He looks toward the bar and sees the women who asked the question. LAURA - MALCOLM'S POV It's Laura, but not the Laura we last saw. She is still young, still vulnerable, but she is bolder, more self-assured, more vividly dressed. She is unaware of Malcolm.
C: HONEY
D: Ain't that him now?
N: ANGLE FAVORING DANIEL. He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread colored boy who comes over to her quickly. He goes to the corner of the bar and quickly grabs Laura's neck and kisses her hungrily.

D: Hey, gorgeous, how you been? Waiting long? Lemme see you. Wow!
N: It's obvious he's a junkie. And in need of a fix. QUICK! SHOT - MALCOLM Honey places his drink and cigarettes before him. He's watching, taking it all in immediately. Laura is clearly crazy about Daniel. CLOSE - MALCOLM He looks, then belts down his drink. CLOSER - LAURA AND DANIEL Daniel motions to her pocketbook and she takes out a five-dollar bill. He grabs it, and bolts for the door. WITH MALCOLM AND HONEY She has been watching Malcolm.

C: MALCOLM
D: Shut up, bitch.
N: He raises his arm to hit her and it is held back before it can find its mark.
C: ARCHIE
D: Don't do that.
N: Archie is standing above him. Malcolm nods, and Archie lets his arm go; standing next to him is Sophia. ARCHIE (contd) Honey, he didn't mean it. Archie wiggles his fingers and Honey goes, but not before throwing daggers at Malcolm and Sophia. Archie sits down, takes out a cigar. For a good beat there is a coolness between them. Then Malcolm reaches over and lights Archie's cigar. Sophia stares at her man, he then motions for her to sit down beside him. ARCHIE (contd) Thanks. You got it. Who's beating on you, Red? You looking a little up tight. The father-son thing is back, but Malcolm will never again be the student.
C: MALCOLM
D: Daddy, where's my money?
C: ARCHIE
D: What you talking?
C: MALCOLM

N: Archie doesn't even look at Sophia.
C: ARCHIE
D: Shit, what else she gonna say?
C: MALCOLM
D: Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
N: Archie is controlling himself. Everyone in Small's is all ears, a falling out between Malcolm and Archie -- their reps are at stake. ANGLE. Archie looks at Sammy. Sammy is neutral. Archie digs in his pockets, comes up with a roll. He peels off six $100 bills and throws them on the table in front of himself, as he gets up.
C: MALCOLM
D: Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.

D: I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.

N: Shorty is driving with Sophia in the front seat. Malcolm is in the back. They are in the country -- outside New York.
C: SHORTY
D: Man, I'm glad we got you out of there. With West Indian Archie on your ass, your name on the wire -- Boston the best goddam place in the world for you -- things are too hot and it's not even summer.
N: Malcolm has withdrawn within himself. He takes out a packet of cocaine and sniffs it.
C: SOPHIA
D: We'll take it easy. I got a place fixed up on Harvard Square. How's that sound?
C: SHORTY
D: Yeah. Cool it and lay dead for a while, Homeboy. And don't worry none.
N: The drug takes hold. Malcolm is out of it. SHORTY (contd) I'll stake you, baby. I got my band. I'm blowing great sax. Hell, you ain't even heard us-- He and Sophia keep talking it up, trying to bolster Malcolm. CLOSE - MALCOLM Stoned, his nose running, Malcolm stares out of the window at the receding landscape. FREEZE FRAME.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: Like every hustler I was trapped. Cats that hung together trying to find a little security, to find an answer -- found nothing. Cats that might have probed space or cured cancer -- -- all victims of whitey's social order.
E: Hell, Archie might have been a mathematical genius
N: Music of a dance combo heard in BG. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) Three things I was always scared of: a job, a bust and jail. I realized then I wasn't afraid of anything. I didn't care. 93 OMIT
S: 94 INT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - DAY
N: Shorty, Sophia and PEG face Malcolm -- stoned in a chair. PEG is 17, Sophia's kid sister and Shorty's date.
C: SHORTY
D: You got to eat somethin', Red.
C: SOPHIA
D: You want eggs, baby?
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
C: SHORTY
D: I ain't doing bad.
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
N: Peg smiles, afraid of Malcolm.
C: SHORTY
D: Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
C: MALCOLM
D: Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
N: Shorty eyes him with amazement. The degree of Malcolm's depravity surprises even him.
C: MALCOLM
D: Surprise you, baby? Well, that's the way it is. What kind of scratch you got on you? Turn out. Let me have it. All of you--
N: Glances exchanged among Shorty, Sophia and Peg. Shorty reaches into his pocket.
S: 95 INT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Malcolm with Sophia, Shorty and Peg around him.
C: MALCOLM
D: We gone rob this town blind. Anybody want out say so.
N: Nobody answers; they'll go with Malcolm. MALCOLM (contd) Okay. I got the stake and I got a fence. I need a driver.
C: PEG
D: How about Rudy?
C: MALCOLM
D: Who's Rudy?
C: SHORTY
D: Yeah, Rudy.
T: JUMP CUT:
N: 95A SAME LOCATION - LATER RUDY is with them. He is a good-looking, very-light skinned black, tough as they come.
C: RUDY
D: I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
C: MALCOLM
D: What can you do?
N: They are in the process of appraising each other, seeing which one has the bigger penis.
C: RUDY
D: You name it, feller.
C: SHORTY
D: Rudy does catering. Rich joints on Beacon Hill.
C: MALCOLM
D: That ain't bad.
C: SHORTY
D: Tell him about Baldy.
C: RUDY
D: Yeah. This rich ofay, like he's 60. I give him a bath on Friday.
N: Peg and Sophia are listening, a little horrified. RUDY (contd) Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
C: MALCOLM
D: So what about him?
C: RUDY
D: So? The man got silver, china, rugs--
C: MALCOLM
D: Might be all right.
C: RUDY
D: Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
N: Malcolm smiles easily.
C: MALCOLM
D: You want to be the head man?
C: RUDY
D: That's right.
C: MALCOLM
D: Head nigger in charge?
C: RUDY
D: I'm the man.
C: MALCOLM
D: Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
N: He takes out his gun, a .38 revolver. He dumps the shells on the table, then reinserts one shell and twirls the barrel. MALCOLM (contd) I'll flip first. He puts the revolver to his own head.
C: PEG
D: Don't.
N: Malcolm squeezes the trigger. It clicks. Now he twirls the barrel again and hands the gun to Rudy.
C: MALCOLM
D: Your flip, baby.
N: Rudy is staring at him; so are they all. Malcolm puts the gun to his temple again.
C: SOPHIA
D: Red, for God's sake--
N: He pulls the trigger a second time. Click. Now he twirls it again.
C: SHORTY
D: Christ, Red, no--
C: PEG
D: I can't stand it.
N: Malcolm puts the gun to Rudy's head.
C: MALCOLM
D: Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
C: RUDY
D: Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
N: A beat.
C: MALCOLM
D: Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
C: SHORTY
D: You the man!
N: Nodding accord from Rudy and Shorty. Sophia can hardly stand.
C: MALCOLM
D: All right. We'll start with Old Talcum Powder. You draw the house, where everything is. You and Peg go out and buy them tools like I told you. We hit tonight on account of in the daytime some of us got that high visibility. Ya dig?
N: Rudy is at a table drawing a diagram; the girls have left. Shorty and Malcolm alone at a window.
C: SHORTY
D: What did you do, Homey, palm it?
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah.
N: He breaks open the gun -- the bullet is in the next slot to be fired. MALCOLM (contd) Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
C: SHORTY
D: Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
N: Malcolm starts laughing: a silent, hysterical laugh.
S: 96 EXT/INT. A BEACON HILL HOUSE - NIGHT
T: The robbery, IN QUICK CUTS:
N: --A door lock is picked by Sophia. 96A --Pencil flashlight passes an upstairs window. 96B --Rudy in the car. 96C --Silver removed from a drawer by Shorty. 96D --Peg walking down the street, as lookout. 96E --Malcolm takes off his shoes. 96F --The sleeping OLD MAN, OLD TALCUM POWDER, as Malcolm takes a watch, a wallet from within inches of his pillow. Then, more boldly, picks up the man's hand and removes a ring from one of his fingers. Shorty watching with bated breath, he's about to have a heart attack.
S: 97 INT. MANSION - DAY
N: A Boston matron, MRS. CRAWFORD, is showing the girls her collection of U.S. silver. In a fine New England home.
C: PEG
D: Beacon Hill survey.
C: SOPHIA
D: We're doing a survey for the Athenaeum Society -- We wondered if you'd permit us to include your collection in the catalog of Great New England Antiques--?
C: MRS. CRAWFORD
D: Now these are my prizes. My Paul Revere silver coffee service.
N: SHOT -- AN ARRANGEMENT OF MUSEUM-QUALITY PIECES
C: PEG
D: Lovely, just lovely.
N: Sophia is casing the room carefully as the matron continues.
C: MRS.CRAWFORD
D: And my husband's collection of scrimshaw should be included.

S: 101 INT. A COURTROOM - DAY
N: The prisoners face the bench: Peg, Sophia, Shorty, Rudy and Malcolm.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew--
C: JUDGE
D: Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
C: JUDGE
D: Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
N: He continues giving them 8 to 10 years, behind Malcolm's comment:
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
C: JUDGE
D: The sentences to run concurrently.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
N: CAMERA HAS GONE IN for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of Malcolm's face: a hardened hustler, pimp, dope peddler and now jailbird at the ripe old age of 20. FREEZE FRAME.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: 102 INT. THE CELL CORRIDOR - DAY
N: It is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30 P.M. The line of PRISONERS stands in front of their cells, as two guards, WILKINS and BARNES, one white, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check. The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three times a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. Whereupon the white guard slams the door shut and locks it.
C: GUARD WILKINS
D: Jackson.
C: PRISONER
D: A 231549.
N: Door is slammed and gate locked. CLOSE - MALCOLM Each time a gate is locked his tension increases. His face is a mask hiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has not had a fix in over a week.
C: GUARD WILKINS
D: Crichlow.
C: SECOND PRISONER
D: A 5991301.
N: Same procedure. ANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards are approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer -- beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him with great respect.
C: PETE
D: Looka Satan.
C: BEMBRY
D: I see him.
N: Bembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the other prisoners.
C: PETE
D: He bout to bust.
C: BEMBRY
D: No, he's not gonna bust. But he's not gonna fix his face to please them, neither.
N: ANGLE. The check-in has reached the man next to Malcolm.
C: GUARD WILKINS
D: Harrington.
C: THIRD PRISONER
D: B 775717.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: Yeah. Lucky Seven.
N: Door slammed and locked. CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM The guards are now in front of him.
C: GUARD WILKINS
D: Little.
N: Malcolm doesn't move.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: State your number.
N: Malcolm doesn't answer, doesn't blink.
C: GUARD WILKINS
D: Little.
N: ANGLE. Bembry in the FG of the scene.
C: BEMBRY
D: He's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break.
N: It's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with admiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: 0kay, I'll give him a break. Now state your number, Little.
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: I forgot it.
N: CLOSE SHOT - BEMBRY Shaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming. ANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face.
C: GUARD WILKINS
D: Can you read, boy? Thass your number.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: Now say it.
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number.
C: GUARD WILKINS
D: Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is.
N: And slams Malcolm hard. He slumps to the floor.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: Two days in the hole. Take him.
N: Wilkins drags Malcolm off as Barnes resumes the roll call. GUARD BARNES (contd) Burnham.
C: FOURTH PRISONER
D: A 551613, sir.
T: JUMP CUT:
S: 103 INT. A SOLITARY CELL - DAY
N: Only the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of a mattress and a slop bucket. If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms, he could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the mattress. A clang as the heavy door is opened.
C: GUARD CONE
D: Time's up. Get on your feet.
N: Malcolm stands. GUARD CONE (contd) Little, state your number. A beat as Malcolm stares at the man, refusing to answer. GUARD CONE (contd) You just drew two more days. And slams the door shut.
S: 104 INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
N: It is almost pitch black. We can almost smell the stench of the room. Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall.
C: TRUSTEE'S VOICE
D: Water.
N: The long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in the cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, wrenching it off in his fury. 105 OMIT
S: 106 INT. SOLITARY CELL - DAY
N: TWO-SHOT - A WHITE CHAPLAIN AND MALCOLM
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
C: MALCOLM
D: Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
N: Door slam.
S: 107 INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
N: Malcolm is alone at the bars: the hope of freedom filling his mind. Malcolm pulls at the bars, tries to shake them in impotent fury. He pounds the walls. Empty, sick, defeated, his nails scratching the walls, he slides to the floor of the cell. It is the low point of his life: nowhere to turn, nothing to hope for.
S: 108 INT. SOLITARY - LATER
N: Guard Cone is shaking him into consciousness.
C: GUARD CONE
D: All right, Little. Get up.
N: Malcolm just about makes it. The guard is in half-focus. GUARD CONE (contd) State your number. He is beaten.
C: MALCOLM
D: A 859912.
N: A shower is heard.
S: 109 INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY
N: Malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his broken body. He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his problems. On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings for a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc. He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's Bembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in the water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left alone.
C: BEMBRY
D: I know how you feel. Like you want to lay down and die.
N: Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding. BEMBRY (contd) I brought you something. He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things. Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.
C: MALCOLM
D: Who the hell are you?
C: BEMBRY
D: Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, what do you want?
C: BEMBRY
D: You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
N: But he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties the contents of the matchbox into it. And drinks it down quickly.
C: BEMBRY
D: Sit down or it might knock you down.
N: Malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he smiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. He at Bembry wonderingly, unable to figure him out.
C: MALCOLM
D: If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
C: BEMBRY
D: I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
C: MALCOLM
D: Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
C: BEMBRY
D: That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
C: MALCOLM
D: What did you give it to me for then?
C: BEMBRY
D: 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
N: This is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him. He eyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.
C: MALCOLM
D: What in the hell are you talking about?
N: He begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is saying.
C: BEMBRY
D: I think you got more sense than any cat in this prison. How come you are such a fool?
N: Malcolm looks over, piqued. BEMBRY (contd) Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the movies. Because even if you get out, you are still in prison. Malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.
C: MALCOLM
D: You ain't lying.
C: BEMBRY
D: When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
N: These last words are spoken sharply with disgust. Malcolm turns his hands massaging the conk into his hair. BEMBRY (contd) Putting all that poison in your hair.
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
C: BEMBRY
D: Why? Why does everybody conk?
C: MALCOLM
D: Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like--
C: BEMBRY
D: Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
C: MALCOLM
D: I ain't said I'm ashamed.
N: He turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun to burn. Bembry restrains him, holding his arm.
C: MALCOLM
D: Leggo. I got to wash it out.
C: BEMBRY
D: Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
N: But it is burning now.
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, you better get off me.
N: He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.
C: BEMBRY
D: Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, I don't want to hear all that.
C: BEMBRY
D: I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
N: Malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry has said disturbs him.
C: MALCOLM
D: Who are you?
N: Malcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the barrage.
C: BEMBRY
D: The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
C: MALCOLM
D: Elijah who?
C: BEMBRY
D: Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
N: And he is gone. Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful moment. He is pulling the comb through his hair.
S: 110 INT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY
N: PRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes license plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks to the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little removed from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, idles by a window. A whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out into the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: You taking the yard?
C: BEMBRY
D: I'm staying.
N: Barnes gestures to Malcolm.
C: MALCOLM
D: Me too.
N: He goes.
C: BEMBRY
D: What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
C: MALCOLM
D: I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
C: BEMBRY
D: What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
C: MALCOLM
D: You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
C: BEMBRY
D: I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
C: MALCOLM
D: Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
C: BEMBRY
D: Don't con me. Don't try...
C: MALCOLM
D: Okay, okay.
C: BEMBRY
D: Don't con me.
C: MALCOLM
D: What do you do with your time?
C: BEMBRY
D: I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
C: MALCOLM
D: That's what Mama used to say.
C: BEMBRY
D: Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
N: Malcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks he has come to the essence of a hustle.
C: MALCOLM
D: Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
C: BEMBRY
D: I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
C: MALCOLM
D: What? Everybody knows God is White.
N: BEMBRY (contd) But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
C: MALCOLM
D: What for?
C: BEMBRY
D: Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
C: MALCOLM
D: What the hell for, man?
C: BEMBRY
D: Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
C: MALCOLM
D: Okay, okay. Show me, man.
N: 110A CLOSE SHOT - A DICTIONARY WE CAN READ the fine print of the definition:
C: DICTIONARY
D: Black, , adj. Destitute of light, devoid of color, enveloped in darkness. Hence, utterly dismal or gloomy, as "the future looked black."
E: blak
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: You understand them words?
C: BEMBRY'S VOICE
D: Read it.
N: PULLBACK TO SHOW Bembry and Malcolm in a small PRISON LIBRARY. No one else is in the book-lined room.
C: MALCOLM
D: I can't make out that shit.
C: BEMBRY
D: Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
C: DICTIONARY
D: See also blackmail, blackball, blackguard.
C: MALCOLM
D: Hey, they's some shit, all right.
C: BEMBRY
D: Now look up "white."
N: Bembry turns the pages of the dictionary to "w." BEMBRY (contd) Read it. CLOSE SHOT - DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF "WHITE"
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: White , adj. Of the color of pure snow; reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The opposite of black, hence free from spot or blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable.
E: whit
N: Malcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis.
C: MALCOLM
D: That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
N: SHOT - THE SHELVES OF BOOKS
C: BEMBRY
D: They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
C: MALCOLM
D: Then what you telling me to study in them for?
C: BEMBRY
D: You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
N: Bembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; he talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the Bible. Right now he goes into street talk.
C: BEMBRY
D: I'll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of these can't nobody read, be he black or white or a Ph.D. with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees.
N: Malcolm laughs. He likes and admires the man. Then caught by a passage he does not understand:
C: MALCOLM
D: Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
C: BEMBRY
D: Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
C: MALCOLM
D: Where am I gonna start?
C: BEMBRY
D: Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here--
N: CLOSE SHOT As Bembry's hand opens the book to page one. CLOSE IN ON A PICTURE OF AN AARDVARK WITH ITS DEFINITION

N: 111 OMIT 112 OMIT
S: 113 INT. MALCOLM'S CELL - NIGHT
N: He is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by. The lights in the cell go out. Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted. He shifts his position to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light coming from the corridor and goes on with his reading. CLOSE SHOT - THE BOOK Malcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the "a's": the words azimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc. He reads a word, then holds his hand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its meaning. Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word for word.
S: 114 INT. LIBRARY - DAY
N: There are several books on the desk before Malcolm. WE SEE their titles: W.E.B. DuBois's _The Soul of Black Folks_, Carter G. Woodson's _Journal of Negro History_, Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, H.G. Wells's _Outline of History_, Spinoza, Thoreau, etc.
C: GUARD BARNES'S VOICE
D: Closing. Knock it off.
N: Malcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast. He gathers up his books with care. He cherishes them, putting them back on the shelf carefully.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: You studying to be the first colored President of the States?
S: 115 INT. LICENSE SHOP - DAY
N: The machines are idle; no one is in the room but Malcolm. He starts to reach inside his jacket when Barnes sticks his head in.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: You taking the yard or not?
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm staying.
C: GUARD BARNES
D: Then give me a butt.
N: Malcolm takes out a half-filled pack of cigarettes, about to offer one, then pauses. Malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes.
C: MALCOLM
D: Take 'em. I don't smoke no more.
N: He takes the pack happily and goes. Malcolm reaches into his jacket again, takes out a book. WE SEE its title: Mahatma Gandhi's _My Struggle_. He sits next to the license press to read.
S: 116 EXT. THE PRISON YARD - DAY
N: A baseball game is in progress. A BLACK TEAM is playing a WHITE ONE. Most of the CONVICTS are watching the game; partisanship at every pitch. A base hit gets a big reaction. ANGLE - MALCOLM AND BEMBRY They are out along the right field wall. They walk throughout the scene. ANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big cheer from the black prisoners. Pete, the batter, trots proudly around the bases.
C: MALCOLM
D: Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
C: BEMBRY
D: Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
N: TWO-SHOT - Malcolm still watching the game.
C: MALCOLM
D: You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
C: BEMBRY
D: The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
N: Malcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement. BEMBRY (contd) We were a race of kings when the white men went around on all fours. There is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base hit, by a black convict, stir the crowd.
C: MALCOLM
D: This a helluva game. Somethin's going on.
N: He sees a black convict, CHUCK, nearby and calls over: MALCOLM (contd) Hey, whatsa score?
C: CHUCK
D: 10 to 1; we murdering them, Din't you hear?
C: MALCOLM
D: What?
C: CHUCK
D: The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson and we pounding the hell out of them, celebrating.
C: MALCOLM
D: How bout that?
C: BEMBRY
D: Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
C: MALCOLM
D: A black man playing big league ball is something.
C: BEMBRY
D: I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue-eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
N: SHOTS OF THE FACES OF THE BLACK BALL PLAYERS AND THE CONVICTS In the stands, cheering and joyous. BEMBRY (contd) Do they know who they are? Do you know where you came from? We are the Original People. Malcolm is listening to him now. BEMBRY (contd) What's your name, boy? Malcolm is startled; answers like a boy.
C: MALCOLM
D: Little.
C: BEMBRY
D: No. That's the name of the slave-master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
N: CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM Wrapped in thought. ANGLE ON MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
C: BEMBRY
D: Who are you?
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM Malcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know. A ball is hit. Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed somewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future leader.
C: BEMBRY
D: I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of Shabazz in the wilderness of North America.
S: 117 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PRISON - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The rays of the sun come through bars that cut across Malcolm and Bembry's face.
C: BEMBRY
D: Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm--
C: MALCOLM
D: Then the devil is white.
C: BEMBRY
D: I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
C: MALCOLM
D: I sure met some.
C: BEMBRY
D: No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
N: CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM Listening.
C: BEMBRY
D: Have you ever known a good white man in all your life? Think back, did you ever meet one who wasn't evil?
N: A prison whistle is heard. 119 OMIT
S: 120 INT. A NICHE IN A PRISON WALL - P.M.
N: Malcolm and Bembry standing close together. The feeling is of someone taking communion: with Bembry the minister and Malcolm the communicant. Their voices are little more than whispers.
C: BEMBRY
D: The body is a holy repository.
C: MALCOLM
D: I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
C: BEMBRY
D: A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
N: Malcolm lifts his head.
C: MALCOLM
D: I will do it.
C: BEMBRY
D: But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
N: Bembry kneels in a praying position. Malcolm stands.
C: MALCOLM
D: I can't.
C: BEMBRY
D: For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth--
C: MALCOLM
D: I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
C: BEMBRY
D: --the hardest and the greatest.
C: MALCOLM
D: I can't.
C: BEMBRY
D: For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth--
C: MALCOLM
D: I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
C: BEMBRY
D: --the hardest and the greatest.
C: MALCOLM
D: I don't know what to say to Allah.
C: BEMBRY
D: Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
N: Malcolm laugh-snorts:
C: MALCOLM
D: Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
C: BEMBRY
D: Tell Him that.
C: MALCOLM
D: I don't know how.
C: BEMBRY
D: You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
C: MALCOLM
D: I want to. God knows I want to.
S: 121 INT. MALCOLM'S CELL-NIGHT
N: Malcolm holds a letter in his hand. He reads it carefully. He has read it several times before.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: I received a letter that day from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The Messenger of Allah wrote me, a nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict.
C: VOICE OF ELIJAH
D: I have come to give you something which can never be taken from you: I bring you a sense of your own worth, the worth of one human being. The knowledge of self.
N: The room becomes transformed. It is suddenly suffused with light. And standing in the cell with Malcolm is ELIJAH MUHAMMAD. He has materialized, but he can be seen through. He is MALCOLM'S HALLUCINATION.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: It was like a blinding light and I became aware that he was in the room with me. He wore a dark suit and on his face I saw a pain so old and deep and black I could scarcely look at him. I knew I was not dreaming. He was there.
C: ELIJAH
D: I tell you that the most dangerous creation of any society in the world is the man with nothing to lose. You do not need ten such men to change the world. One will do. The Earth belongs to us, the Black man and whatever is around it, and on it and in it. Praises are due to him forever for bringing to us again, our self and our property, the UNIVERSE OF SUN, MOON, AND STARS.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: And suddenly as he came, he was gone.
N: The hallucination disappears. VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) And then I could do it. Malcolm goes down on his knees. There are tears in his eyes as he begins praying: CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: Allah Akbar: all praise to Him who is all-seeing, all-understanding.
N: He continues to pray.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: We are told that Saul, on the road to Damascus, heard the words of truth, he fell from his horse. I do not liken myself to Paul, but I understand. It happened to me.
S: 122 INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: A poorly furnished, small, but immaculate room. There are two couches, a table set for eating, and, on the walls, a portrait of Elijah and a Muslim banner. It is dinner time in a Muslim home. SIDNEY, aged 20, a perfect specimen of the Fruit of Islam, stands behind his chair, waiting. Their mother, LORRAINE, a woman of Bembry's age, is seated, but she, too, awaits Bembry. SHOT - BEMBRY
C: BEMBRY
D: In the name of Allah, the beneficent and the merciful to whom all praise is due.
N: At the window Bembry saying the evening prayers.
C: BEMBRY'S VOICE
D: Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah...
N: He comes to the table, nods and sits. Sidney respectfully sits after him. Food is passed. It is simple fare: natural foods, milk, greens. The portions are small. They eat in silence, but there is warmth and love at this table. BEMBRY'S VOICE (contd) ... We don't have much, but what we have is yours. Lorraine and my two sons join with me in saying that when you come out, which will not be too long, come straight to us.
S: 123 INT. PRISON BARBER SHOP - DAY
N: Malcolm is reading Bembry's letter as he waits his turn. There is a WHITE CONVICT in the chair, just being finished by a WHITE BARBER - SIMMONS. A BLACK BARBER - SLIM sits by. Both are convicts. NOTE: Malcolm now wears glasses, all that reading in his badly lit cell has ruined his eyes.
C: BEMBRY'S VOICE
D: You write thanking me. Don't thank me. Praise Allah. He did it all.
C: SIMMONS
D: Next.
N: Malcolm starts for the chair. Simmons moves away to light a cigarette as Slim takes over.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: Dear Bembry. Please thank the Honorable Elijah Muhammad for the money and tell him I have not written him because I have not yet proven myself.
S: 124 INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
N: Archie and Cadillac are reading a letter they have received. They look at each other incredulously.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: But I have written everyone else.
N: 125 ANOTHER PRISON - DAY Shorty is waving a letter he has received to his CELLMATE.
C: SHORTY
D: Look like Homey got himself a brand new hype.
S: 126 INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
N: An immaculate room, well furnished. ELIJAH sits in a chair as Bembry stands reading Malcolm's letter.
C: BEMBRY
D: "I wrote the Mayor, the Governor and the President, but for some reason I haven't heard from them"...
N: Bembry laughs; Elijah smiles.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: Tell the Messenger of Allah that I have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face. I greet you with the ancient words: "As Salaam Alikum."
C: ELIJAH
D: Wa-Alaikum Salaam.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: P.S. I finally worked my way through the "Z's"...
S: 127 INT. PRISON CHAPEL - NIGHT
N: TITLE - 6 YEARS LATER A GROUP OF PRISONERS, mostly white, but with a goodly smattering of black convicts, are listening to a lecture by CHAPLAIN GILL.
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: Are there any questions?
N: ANGLE. Malcolm seated next to a black convict, raises his hand. It's the only hand up. The Chaplain searches for another questioner, but there aren't any. Pete, sitting next to Malcolm, whispers.
C: PETE
D: Watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion.
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: I see this has become a struggle between good and evil. Satan has a question.
N: There is laughter from the convicts.
C: MALCOLM
D: Yes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn't want to say which one of us is what.
N: Laughter, especially from the black convicts.
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: Why don't you just ask your question?
C: MALCOLM
D: You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: I don't think we know for certain.
N: There are reactions from the convicts. Malcolm is sharply challenging a white man about color.
C: MALCOLM
D: They were Hebrew, weren't they?
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: That's right.
C: MALCOLM
D: As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: Just what is your question?
C: MALCOLM
D: What color were the original Hebrews?
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: I told you we don't know for certain.
C: MALCOLM
D: Then we don't know that God was white.
N: There is a strong reaction to this.
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: Now just a moment, just a moment--
C: MALCOLM
D: But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
C: CHAPLAIN GILL
D: Just what are you saying?
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
N: 127A INSERT FLASH - A BLOND, BLUE-EYED JESUS ON THE CROSS (Note: Try to get footage from _The Last Temptation of Christ_ [Willem Dafoe])
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: God is black.
S: 128 INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Malcolm opens the door, the room is dark and he sees a small, slight man standing against the window, he doesn't move. This is the same man who appeared in Malcolm's cell, this is the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm slowly moves toward him; he is completely humbled in his presence. CLOSE - ELIJAH He turns from the window to Malcolm.
C: ELIJAH
D: My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a pimp and the world is still full of temptation. When God bragged how faithful Job was, the devil argued that only God's protective hedge around him kept him pure, the devil said remove the hedge and he will curse his maker. Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I believe you will remain faithful.
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM He cannot say anything and he drops his head, he is overwhelmed with heartfelt emotion.
S: 129 INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - P.M.
N: In contrast to the peaceful family scene, the room is a beehive of activity. Sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine; Lorraine is busy making up a mailing list using 3 x 5 file cards; Bembry is recruiting on the telephone.
C: MALCOLM
D: How many you turning out?
N: SIDNEY
C: MALCOLM
D: Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
C: SIDNEY
D: Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
N: Earl moves toward Malcolm and extends his hands. Malcolm shakes it warmly.
C: MALCOLM
D: We can always use another good brother.
C: EARL
D: I'm a willing servant for Allah.
S: 129A EXT. CHURCH - DAY
N: Sunday service has let out and Malcolm, Earl, and Sidney are "fishing." They're trying to convert the Black Christians. Malcolm speaks, while the others hand out leaflets.
C: MALCOLM
D: You think you are Christians, and yet you see your so-called white Christian brother hanging black Christians on trees. You say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you. He has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on earth. Islam is the black man's true religion.
S: 130 EXT. STREET CORNER, 125TH AND SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY
N: Malcolm is talking to a CROWD from a ladder.
C: MALCOLM
D: And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God is black and you are made in His image and don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are.
N: The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity. MALCOLM (contd) My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's pie in the sky. ANGLE ON SIDNEY Amid the listeners, watching their response.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down on his knees begging the Lord to give him in heaven what the white devil enjoys right here on earth?
N: CLOSE SHOT - SEVERAL LISTENERS They turn from Malcolm, moving a few steps away, and now are the audience on an adjacent SPEAKER. He is a young firebrand:
C: SPEAKER
D: The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for rent control and for community control of our schools.
N: PAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just one among many:
C: SECOND SPEAKER
D: If the man behind the counter ain't black, don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think black. Buy black.
N: ANGLE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because, brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead. And we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead.
S: 131 EXT. OPEN AIR "MAID'S MARKET" - DAY
N: A place where black women come to offer themselves for day work. SEVERAL ARE SEEN. A WHITE WOMEN comes up to one to interview her (bargain with her). Malcolm's voice is heard before he is seen, speaking to the women from a ladder.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful. Beautiful because you are black. Because black is beautiful. You work in the white folks' kitchen so I don't have to tell you that they're devils.
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM MALCOLM (contd) And you are putting yourselves on the auction block, letting them examine you like a horse, like a slave. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches that you are black and should be proud... FACE OF ONE BLACK WOMAN, beginning to shake her head in accord.
S: 132 INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
N: The SAME WOMAN, now at a Muslim meeting. The faces of other listeners (from the church and from the maids' market) are scattered in Malcolm's audience. The headquarters itself shows the progress Malcolm has made. It is better furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled. Bembry, Sidney, and Lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth. Malcolm stands at a podium.
C: MALCOLM
D: We're not American, we're Africans who happen to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought here against our will from Africa. We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister. Plymouth Rock landed on us.
N: Reactions: laughter, interest. Ad lib "That's the truth."
C: MALCOLM
D: Put an end to your begging. No more "Please, Mr. White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another crumb from off your table, kindly, sir." We are a nation, a great nation and don't need a thing from them.
N: Malcolm scanning the faces of his audience as they react. He sees someone he knows and blurts out boyishly (and winningly): MALCOLM (contd) Shorty! The crowd turns to Shorty, sitting embarrassedly in the audience. MALCOLM (contd) Come on up here, man, and give us some skin. Here's a man, brothers and sisters, who shot up with me, who robbed with me, and did time in the white devil's jailhouse. Stand up, Shorty, and be counted-- But Shorty is trying to hide from the spotlight. Malcolm comes down from the platform and walks to him. MALCOLM (contd) Folks, the brother is shy and needs special attention. So would you excuse us, while Brothers Sidney and Earl take up the collection. He embraces Shorty as the crowd laughs appreciatively and Brothers Sidney and Earl have a chuckle themselves.
S: 133 INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT
N: Shortly and Malcolm sit at a table. Shorty has a cup of coffee in front of him.
C: SHORTY
D: I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
C: MALCOLM
D: It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
C: SHORTY
D: Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
C: MALCOLM
D: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
C: SHORTY
D: Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
C: MALCOLM
D: I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
C: SHORTY
D: You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
C: MALCOLM
D: How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
C: SHORTY
D: Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
N: 133A INSERT FLASH - Sammy, he's dead on top of TEENAGE WHORE who is screaming, trying to push that dead weight off her.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: How about Old Cadillac?
N: 133B INSERT FLASH - Cadillac is an old junkie, past reclaiming, sitting staring in a MENTAL WARD, twitching, nose running.
C: SHORTY'S VOICE
D: Hooked on horse. Been in and out of Lexington Ave times.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: You seen Sophia?
N: 133C INSERT FLASH - Sophia is a bored housewife, she's in the kitchen cooking while her husband hides behind the Wall Street Journal. 133D BACK TO THE BAR
C: SHORTY
D: I ain't seen Archie, but the vine tells it he's living somewhere's in the Bronx. If you can call it living.
S: 134 INT. A DINGY ROOM - DAY
N: A knock on the door rouses Archie, by now an old and dying man. All the vigor is gone, all the life has ebbed out.
C: ARCHIE
D: Git the hell away, you bitch, I'll pay you tomorrow.
N: Door opens, Malcolm enters.
C: MALCOLM
D: Hello, Archie.
N: Archie sits up from his bed and stares. He tries to bring back some of his old juice, tries to stand up.
C: ARCHIE
D: My man, Red. Come on in, man. Hey, I can't make it.
E: then giving up
N: Malcolm has to help him lie back.
C: MALCOLM
D: Take it easy, baby.
C: ARCHIE
D: That really you, Red?
N: The contrast is shocking: Malcolm tall and straight; Archie ruined.
C: MALCOLM
D: You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
C: ARCHIE
D: I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
C: MALCOLM
D: I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
C: ARCHIE
D: Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a chance--
C: MALCOLM
D: Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but--
C: ARCHIE
D: No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
C: MALCOLM
D: Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
C: ARCHIE
D: Yeah.
C: MALCOLM
D: You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
N: The old man is asleep. MALCOLM (contd) You know all the angles except how to live.
S: 135 EXT. A STREET IN HARLEM - NIGHT
N: Malcolm walks thoughtfully down the street; Archie is still on his mind, as he passes prostitute after prostitute. Once beautiful women now selling their bodies. He passes Laura, she has been turned totally out and she looks the part, there is no way he can recognize her. We do though. CLOSE - LAURA She has just gotten a white John and leads him into an alley.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: Women who could be mothers, teachers, scientists...
N: ANGLE - ALLEY Laura kneels down to unzip her John's pants. MALCOLM'S VOICE (contd) Who is going to raise our children?; men who might have been astronauts, composers, engineers; Who is going to be the head of the households?--
S: 136 INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
N: Malcolm is addressing a HUGE AUDIENCE. His tone is more intense, more personal than before, because of his recent encounters. In the audience, sitting with Bembry, is BETTY, a lovely dark-skinned woman. Her interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried sisters) is more than religious.
C: MALCOLM
D: --and what has the white devil made of them: dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He should fall on his knees and say, "My kind commits history's greatest crime against your kind every day of your life." But does he? No. He scorns you, splits your head with his nightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had it, then stand up and come forward. If not us, then who? If not now, then when?
N: ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE Many stand, some walk toward the podium speaking his name: "I'm with you, Brother Malcolm," "Praise Allah," "Me, Brother Malcolm." There is applause; some of the audience get to their feet -- Malcolm acknowledges their approval, trying to quiet them, but caught up in the heady excitement of leadership. CLOSE - BETTY AND BEMBRY Both are moved by Malcolm's performances.
C: BETTY
D: He ought to try to make it a little easier, Brother Bembry.
E: whispering
C: BEMBRY
D: Why don't you try telling him that, Sister Betty?
S: 137 INT. A LARGE ANTEROOM IN TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
N: The Muslim movement has grown enormously. The activity in this anteroom, leading to other rooms off it, shows that. Betty and Bembry stand before a Directory announcing activities in the Temple: MONDAY - Fruit of Islam Meeting; TUESDAY - Unity Night; WEDNESDAY - Student Enrollment; THURSDAY - Muslim Girls Training; FRIDAY - General Civilization Class; SATURDAY - Swahili, etc. A stir of people and activity as Malcolm enters the anteroom. He excuses himself from a group of MUSLIMS, making his way toward Bembry.
C: MALCOLM
D: Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
E: little out of breath
C: BEMBRY
D: I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
N: Malcolm nods at her; she nods in return. BEMBRY (contd) The Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene and diet. Malcolm mutters "very good," but his mind is clearly on a million other details. BEMBRY (contd) The Sister stresses care of the body and regular eating habits. Malcolm is still distracted.
C: BETTY
D: The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the Promised Land?
N: Malcolm is stopped. He looks at Betty.
C: MALCOLM
D: What?
C: BETTY
D: She ate.
N: Malcolm laughs. BETTY (contd) And the Sister suggests he put his actions where his mouth is. Malcolm's laughter is heard, in response.
S: 138 INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
C: BETTY
D: If you want to tell me.
T: CUT TO:
S: 138A EXT. ELIJAH'S GARDEN - DAY
N: Malcolm sits next to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The student and the teacher.
C: MALCOLM
D: If you want to tell me.
C: ELIJAH
D: Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: 138B BETTY AND MALCOLM Betty says nothing, she merely pushes the salad plate a little toward him. The food has thus far gone untouched. Malcolm continues. CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
C: BETTY
D: Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE - ELIJAH
C: ELIJAH
D: No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not practice celibacy. If a woman is the right height for a man, the right complexion, if her age is half the man's plus seven, if she understands that man's essential nature is strong and woman's weak, if she loves children, can cook, sew and stay out of trouble--
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE - BETTY
C: BETTY
D: I think you've made your points, Brother Malcolm.
C: MALCOLM
D: What points?
C: BETTY
D: That you haven't time for either marriage or eating--
N: Malcolm chuckles a bit. BETTY (contd) --and that women aren't the only ones who talk a lot. Now he bursts out laughing. CLOSE - BROTHERS SIDNEY AND EARL They are alarmed at Brother Minister's behavior. TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM
C: BETTY
D: If you'll start eating, there is a question I have. Go ahead. Start.
N: He takes a forkful of the salad. BETTY (contd) Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
C: MALCOLM
D: Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
C: BETTY'S VOICE:
D: Yes, I understand, Brother Malcolm. Purely scientific.
S: 139 INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY
N: Before a comparative evolutionary display showing the skeletons of various animals, Malcolm is holding forth. Betty is dressed in a vivid, becoming red dress.

N: CLOSE ON THE SKELETONS
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: ...All members of the pig-rodent family.
C: BETTY
D: I see your point.
C: MALCOLM
D: So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
N: ANGLE. As they saunter out, passing the huge skeletons of prehistoric animals now.
C: BETTY
D: Could we sit down someplace?
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.

S: 140 INT. SODA FOUNTAIN - DAY
C: WAITER
D: You're the strawberry soda and you're the hot fudge sundae.

C: MALCOLM
D: That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
C: BETTY
D: What?
C: MALCOLM
D: Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
C: BETTY
D: How do you like it?
C: MALCOLM

C: BETTY
D: There's nothing to talk about.
C: MALCOLM
D: 0h, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
C: BETTY
D: Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
C: MALCOLM
D: You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
E: a beat
C: BETTY
D: I can handle it.
C: MALCOLM
D: They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
C: BETTY
D: You have enough worries of your own.
C: MALCOLM
D: No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
C: BETTY
D: Why do you ask?
C: MALCOLM
D: Just an idle question.
C: BETTY
D: If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
N: She takes a bite of her sundae. BETTY (contd) But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
C: MALCOLM
D: How old are you, Betty?
C: BETTY
D: There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
C: MALCOLM
D: Are you?
C: BETTY
D: And dogged when I set my mind to something.
C: MALCOLM
D: What have you set your mind to?
C: BETTY
D: Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
N: Malcolm takes a good look at the lovely woman in front of him, then a long sip from his ice cream soda.

C: LIEUTENANT
D: All right, break it up. You got what you wanted.
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm not satisfied.
N: Malcolm starts walking down the center of the street, after the ambulance. MALCOLM (contd) To the hospital. The Fruit of Islam fall in behind him, marching slowly. It takes on the start of a march as the neighborhood people fall in behind them. People (especially kids) race with them on the street and on the sidewalk. ANGLE - BENJAMIN Benjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside Malcolm, the Brothers in the Fruit stop him and Benjamin drops back.
S: 146 EXT. LENOX AVENUE - NIGHT
N: Now the march has taken over the broad avenue. COPS are forced to redirect traffic, holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly by. The people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration. Their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that, for once, something is being done about what has happened.
S: 147 EXT. HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT
N: LONG SHOT SHOWS the Muslim men in perfect order, calm with their arms folded across their chests, waiting. Their eyes are on Malcolm as he walks toward the hospital entrance.

N: SHOT The unruly crowd behind the Fruit of Islam. They are restive, milling, ugly.
C: CAPTAIN GREEN

S: 149 EXT. OUTSIDE HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT
C: DOCTOR

C: DOCTOR
D: I had to put a plate in his head.
C: MALCOLM
D: You bastards.
E: to Captain
C: CAPTAIN GREEN
D: All right, okay. Now disperse this mob.
N: MEDIUM SHOT - MALCOLM, FRUIT OF ISLAM AND CROWD It's clear the decision is in one man's hands, Malcolm's. CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM He makes a gesture with his hand, the Fruit of Islam disperse. ANGLE. People moving away, going home. Only one person remains from the Fruit of Islam and the crowd, it's Benjamin. CLOSE - CAPTAIN GREEN
C: CAPTAIN GREEN
D: That's too much power for one man to have.
S: 149A INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT
N: Everyone is in a somber mood over the evening's events. ANGLE - TABLE Malcolm sits with Brothers Earl and Sidney.
C: SIDNEY
D: Brother Minister, we need to strike back.
C: BROTHER EARL
D: Put fear into those devils.
C: MALCOLM
D: I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
C: BROTHER EARL
D: I'm tired of praying.
C: MALCOLM
D: That's enough, Brother Earl.
N: ANGLE - ENTRANCE Benjamin comes into the cafeteria and everyone looks at him. He sees Malcolm sitting and moves toward his table. ANGLE - TABLE Brothers Sidney and Earl get up to intercept him but Malcolm waves him through. Benjamin stands.
C: MALCOLM
D: Sit down, son.
N: Malcolm pours some cream into his cup of black coffee, then also some white sugar. MALCOLM (contd) There is only one thing I like integrated. My coffee. Benjamin laughs. MALCOLM (contd) What can I do for you?
C: BENJAMIN
D: Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
N: ANGLE - SIDNEY AND EARL They exchange dubious looks.
C: MALCOLM
D: Do you know what it means to be a true Muslim?
N: Benjamin hesitates. MALCOLM (contd) Do you?
C: BENJAMIN
D: Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
C: MALCOLM
D: I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
N: Benjamin is crushed and he starts to get up. MALCOLM (contd) We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
C: BENJAMIN
D: Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
S: 180 INT. TEMPLE #1 - DETROIT - DAY
N: CLOSE - NEWSPAPER HEADLINE (DAILY NEWS) MALCOLM X WINS $70,000 JUDGMENT FOR BEATEN NEGRO An AIDE of Elijah puts down the newspaper and shakes Malcolm's hand.
C: AIDE
D: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad would like to see you now.
S: 151 INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Elijah is sweeping the floor with a plain hand broom. Malcolm enters the room, is surprised and waits at the door. The two are alone together.
C: ELIJAH
D: If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
C: MALCOLM
D: Let me do it then.
C: ELIJAH
D: No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
C: MALCOLM
D: Allah Akbar.
N: The sweeping done, they stand together near a table at a window.
C: ELIJAH
D: Tonight I shall introduce you as my National Representative. It will be a difficult task. Your assignment is to build temples all over this nation. More work than you have ever done in your life and you will be in the public eye. My son, beware of those cameras, they are just as bad as a narcotic.
N: ANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening. ELIJAH (contd) Yes, the white devil will watch your every step. Even your own Brothers will become jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you a parable -- regarding your work. Elijah picks up a glass and sets it before Malcolm. ELIJAH (contd) Here is a glass, dirty and its water foul. If you offer it to the people and they have no choice, they must drink out of it. But if you present them with this glass-- He is holding a clean glass, with clear water in it. ELIJAH (contd) --and let them make their decision, they will choose the pure vessel. Islam is the only religion which addresses the needs and problems of the so-called Negro, especially in the ghettos -- Islam is the only way out from drugs, crime, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol, gambling, fornication and adultery. Elijah holds up the clear glass.
C: VOICE OF MALCOLM X
D: This sweet, gentle man gave me the truth from his own mouth. And I adored him, in the sense of the Latin root of the word. Adorare, to worship and to fear. He was the first man I ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of a gun but the fear one has of the power of the sun, I pledged myself to him, even if it cost me my life.
S: 152 INT. A HOSPITAL WARD - DAY
N: Betty is administering to a PATIENT, as a phone is heard ringing. It's answered. ANOTHER NURSE motions Betty to the phone. She finishes with her patient and goes quickly.
C: BETTY
D: Hello.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: Sister Betty?
C: BETTY
D: Yes.
S: 153 EXT. A PAY PHONE AT A GAS STATION - DAY
C: MALCOLM

C: BETTY
D: Yes.
C: MALCOLM
D: Did you hear what I said?
C: BETTY
D: Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
C: MALCOLM
D: I think so. Can you catch a plane?
C: BETTY
D: Yes. Did you eat?
C: MALCOLM
D: I love you.
S: 154 INT. BEMBRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Betty and Malcolm sit on the floor in the dimlit room, very close.
C: MALCOLM
D: It won't be easy.
C: BETTY
D: Just hold me.
C: MALCOLM
D: It will be rough.
C: BETTY
D: Hush your mouth.
C: MALCOLM
D: I'll be away a lot.
C: BETTY
D: You're with me even when you're away.
N: He embraces her. Then Betty laughs. BETTY (contd) I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
C: MALCOLM
D: What do you think?
C: BETTY
D: The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
N: Full embrace.
C: BEMBRY'S VOICE
D: We're waiting on you folks. You trying to starve us?
S: 155 INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Malcolm has just cut the cake and handed a slice to Betty. Amid laughter and great warmth, Sidney unfurls the front page of the _Messenger_, the Muslim newspaper. Headline reads: "MALCOLM X WEDS BETTY SAUNDERS." Betty kisses her husband and Bembry, Lorraine, Earl, Sidney, Peter and VARIOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS applaud. We notice the subtle change in the apartment: it is more comfortable; there is even evidence of some small luxury: a TV set, a new settee, etc.
S: 156 EXT. RALLY - HARLEM - DAY
N: Malcolm is speaking to a GOOD SIZED AUDIENCE:
C: MALCOLM
D: I must emphasize at the outstart, that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, so I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist, not even as an American. For if I was an American the problem that confronts our people today would not exist. So I stand here as what I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN!
N: CROWD REACTIONS MALCOLM (contd) Before there were any such things as Democrats or Republicans, we were black. Before there were any such things as Masons or Elks, we were black. Before there were any such things as Jews or Christians, we were black people. In fact long before there was ever any such place as America, we were black people... And after America has long passed from the scene there will still be BLACK PEOPLE. CLOSE - BENJAMIN He is neatly dressed in white shirt, jacket and tie, a fine young Muslim.
C: BENJAMIN 2X
D: Take your time.
S: 157 INT. CHICAGO TEMPLE - NIGHT
N: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad sits on the stage to the right of Malcolm. This is a larger audience.
C: MALCOLM
D: What kind of black people does the Honorable Elijah Muhammad speak for? Black people who are jobless... the black masses who are poor, hungry, and angry, the black masses who are dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to live... the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist in our community... the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced by these semi-savage white policemen that patrol our community, like the occupation forces of a conquering enemy army... the black masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle Tom leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people and to KEEP US SATISFIED AND PACIFIED WITH NOTHING!
N: CROWD - REACTIONS CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: If the black man cannot go back to his own people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is asking that a part of the United States be separated and given to the Muslims so they can live separately.
N: CLOSE - ELIJAH MALCOLM (contd) The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the only man the white people can deal with in the solving of problems of the so-called Negro... CLOSE - MALCOLM MALCOLM (contd) ...as Elijah Muhammad knows his problems.
S: 158 INT. BETTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A modest room. She is rocking a cradle with her foot as she writes:
C: BETTY'S VOICE
D: Attallah is fine. Our firstborn is an angel and a beauty. And misses you as I do. But the news that you've dedicated four new temples is almost as good as having you with us.
S: 158A INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Malcolm sits in front of a television screen and watches the evening news. The following speech will be INTERCUT with A SERIES OF OLD NEWSREEL FOOTAGE - BLACK & WHITE (newsclips from Birmingham, Selma, Mississippi, and elsewhere): 158B --POLICE using dogs against DEMONSTRATORS. 158C --The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King marching. 158D --Cattle prods used against MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN. 158E --The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King singing "We Shall Overcome." 158F --PREGNANT WOMAN knocked down by high-pressure water hoses. 158G --The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King leading a crowd in prayer. 158H --Students sitting in at a counter. 158I --The smoldering ruins of Birmingham's 16th St. Baptist church.
C: 158J MALCOLM/HIS VOICE
D: The white people who are guilty of white supremacy try and hide their own guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of teaching black supremacy when he tries to uplift the mentality, the social, and economic condition of black people in this country. And the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting the black people economically, civilly, and otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic simply because he teaches our people to go into business for ourselves and trying to take over the economic leadership in our own community. The black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the white man for 400 years, and following the ignorant Negro preachers, we have thought that it was God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they use to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them to love their enemy or pray for those who use them as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is showing black people that just as the white man and every other person on this earth has God given rights, natural rights, civil rights, and any other kind of rights that you can think of when it comes to defending himself.
S: A-C INT. TV STUDIO
N: CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM'S FACE With a studio mike around his neck, he's on a panel show. ANGLE - MODERATOR
C: MODERATOR
D: Mr. X, before we start our discussion tonight -- The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers -- would you mind explaining for us the meaning of your name, which is the letter X.
N: ANGLE - PANEL Opposing Malcolm is DR. PAYSON, a NAACP-type NEGRO. CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: Yes sir. As you know, during slavery time, the slavemasters named most of the so-called Negroes in America after themselves. Mr. Elijah Muhammad teaches us once you come into the knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name with an X. Since we've been disconnected, cut off from our Eastern culture for so long that we don't know the names we originally had, we will use X until we get back to the East.
N: ANGLE - MODERATOR
C: MODERATOR
D: Thank you. Now Dr. Payson.
N: CLOSE - DR. PAYSON
C: DR. PAYSON
D: Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
N: CLOSE: - DR. PAYSON
C: MALCOLM
D: Please, go ahead.
C: DR. PAYSON
D: Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
N: ANGLE - PANEL
C: MODERATOR
D: Certainly, Mr. X, you must admit there has been progress.
C: MALCOLM
D: I'll talk about "progress" in a minute, but let me finish with my brother.
N: Malcolm gestures to the Negro panelist. The BLACK MEMBERS of the TV audience are lapping it up. Betty and Earl also sit in the TV studio audience. MALCOLM (contd) Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
C: DR. PAYSON
D: You put it very well.
C: MALCOLM
D: You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
C: DR. PAYSON
D: Entirely.
N: ANGLE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
N: There is some blanching and guffawing from the audience. The moderator is totally embarrassed, Betty roars. MALCOLM (contd) And I'm not finished. To understand this man-- He points a sharp finger at the Negro Panelist. MALCOLM (contd) --you must know that historically there are two kinds of slaves. House Negroes and Field Negroes. The house Negro lived in the big house; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty good and he loved the master. Yeah, he loved him more than the master loved himself. If the master's house caught fire, he'd be the first to put the blaze out. If the master got sick, he'd say: "What's a matter, boss; we sick?" WE sick! If someone said to him, "Let's run away and escape. Let's separate." He'd say, "Man, are you crazy? What's better than what I got here?" That was the House Negro. In those days he was called the House Nigger. Well, that's what we call them today because we still got a lot of House Niggers running around. There is applause from the blacks in the audience. Moderator tries to regain control.

N: CLOSE - THE HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD He is enjoying this display by his prize student, the CAMERA PANS to a CLOSE SHOT of BEMBRY and the same cannot be said. 159E BACK TO STUDIO
C: MODERATOR
D: I think, perhaps, Dr. Payson has something to--
C: MALCOLM
D: Don't you want to hear about the Field Nigger?
C: DR. PAYSON
D: Let him finish.
C: MALCOLM
D: Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
C: BROTHER BENJAMIN
D: Tell it.
C: MALCOLM
D: --there's another one. The majority of black Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't talk about OUR progress, about OUR government, OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't even let you near the plant.
S: 159F INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Bembry turns off the TV set and he commences to plant the seeds of "betrayal." CLOSE - BEMBRY
C: BEMBRY
D: Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting too much press. The brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he is. You lifted him out of the darkness.
N: CLOSE - ELIJAH
C: ELIJAH
D: Go and tell the brothers what Brother Minister is doing, has done, has been of great benefit to the Nation.
N: CLOSER - BEMBRY
C: BEMBRY

When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education. 159M CUTAWAYS TO THE DESPAIR OF HARLEM - SLUMS, TENEMENTS, GARBAGE, RATS MALCOLM (contd) Poor education, you only work on poor paying jobs and that enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood.
T: 159N CUTAWAY TO BLACK FACES
N: MALCOLM (contd) So it's a very vicious cycle. We've got to break it.
S: 159O INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA
N: Benjamin weakly walks toward Malcolm and gives him his letter, which he takes. The fast is wearing him out. CLOSE - MALCOLM Malcolm is inspecting it. CLOSE - BENJAMIN His face is filled with apprehension. ANGLE - MALCOLM AND BENJAMIN
C: MALCOLM
D: You are now Benjamin 2X.
C: BENJAMIN 2X
D: All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
C: MALCOLM
D: Come, sit with us.
N: ANGLE - TABLE Benjamin 2X sits with Malcolm and Brothers Earl and Sidney.
C: MALCOLM

C: EARL
D: Allah Akbar.
C: SIDNEY
D: You will be good.
C: BENJAMIN 2X
D: Brother Minister, can I have something to eat?
N: Everyone laughs.
C: MALCOLM
D: Let's get this man some food.
S: 160 EXT. HARVARD SQUARE - DAY
N: A CROWD OF STUDENTS outside the Law School. The setting is the same as the last time we saw Malcolm and Shorty here, except now the students part for him. Malcolm walks slowly toward the entrance, looking up at the Latin inscription of the building when he is stopped by a WHITE COED.
C: COED
D: Mr. X, I've read some of your speeches and I honestly believe a lot of what you say has truth to it. I have a good heart. I'm a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself, who are not prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help the cause?
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM He stares at her.
C: MALCOLM
D: Nothing!
N: CLOSE - COED She is absolutely crushed and runs away in tears.
S: 161 INT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL - DAY
N: Speaking to a packed STUDENT AUDIENCE.
C: MALCOLM
D: ...My high school was the black ghetto of Roxbury. My college was the streets of Harlem, and I took my masters in prison. If you look out the window--
N: 161A SHOT MALCOLM'S OLD GANG HANGOUT
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: --you can see my burglary hangout. I lived like an animal. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in an insane asylum or dead.
N: ANGLE - The audience carefully listening.
C: MALCOLM
D: Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side, so God will be on our side to help us fight our battles. When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and committing adultery. When we get off the welfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need for your family, then your family respects you. They'll be proud to say "That's my father." She's proud to say "That's my husband..." Father means you're taking care of those children. Just 'cause you made them that don't mean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby, but anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can go and get a woman but anybody can't take care of a woman. This is the type of teaching that the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we can build the moral fiber of our people.
N: SHOT OF REPORTERS IN AUDIENCE Beginning to scribble furiously.
C: MALCOLM
D: I can see the gentlemen of the press, also the FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz if I said, "Mary had a little lamb," they'd write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.
N: Loud laughter from the audience. But this response is overwhelmed by the response of ANOTHER, LARGER AUDIENCE.
S: 162 INT. MONSTER RALLY - NIGHT
N: Malcolm is talking before an all-black audience. It is the largest rally yet; the hall is packed to the rafters.
C: MALCOLM
D: We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100 temples in fifty states. From a handful we have grown to scores of thousands.
N: VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RALLY HAWKERS selling _The Messenger_, faces of Fruit of Islam near the podium; Lorraine, Sidney, Earl, Benjamin, and Bembry. For the first time a new note is seen in Bembry's face: reserve bordering on resentment. When others around him cheer Malcolm, Bembry is cool. Sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.
C: MALCOLM/HIS VOICE
D: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that God is now about to establish a kingdom on this earth based on brotherhood and
N: against peace, his history on this earth has proved that. Nowhere in history has he been brotherly toward anyone. The only time he has been brotherly toward you is when he can use you, when he can exploit you, when he can oppress you, when you will submit to him. And since his own history makes him unqualified to be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that God is about to eliminate that particular race from this earth. So since they are due for elimination, we don't want to be with them. ANGLE - CROWD CLOSE - MALCOLM MALCOLM (contd) If the so-called Negro were American citizens we wouldn't have a race problem. If the Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. All of this is hypocrisy. These Negro leaders have been telling the white man everything is all right, everything is under control. And they've been telling the white man that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to him. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been saying is going to come to pass is now coming to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing up saying that we are about to have a racial explosion. We're going to have a racial explosion and that's more dangerous than an atomic explosion. ANGLE - MALCOLM MALCOLM (contd) It's going to explode because black people are dissatisfied. They're dissatisfied now not only with the white man, but with these Negroes who have been sitting around here posing as leaders and spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing is going to explode and if the thing that explodes is still inside the house, then the house will be destroyed. So the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get this powder keg out of your house, let the black people in this country separate from him while there's still time. And if the black man is allowed to separate and go on onto some land of his own, where he can solve his problems, then there won't be any explosion. COMPLETE SEPARATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE BLACK AND WHITE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY!!! ANGLE - CROWD A wave of cheers as people explode.
S: 163 INT. AN ANTEROOM OF THE RALLY - NIGHT
N: The rally is over. A small room packed with PEOPLE congratulating Malcolm, trying to touch him. He is the hero of the hour. Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin with him, enjoying the accolades and trying to help Malcolm make his way out. Bembry stands apart, removed and silent.
C: MALCOLM
D: Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
C: SIDNEY
D: Please make way, please--
N: ANGLE. A WELL-KNOWN PERSONALITY (DICK GREGORY) is at the door. He and Malcolm know each other well. Malcolm extends a palm, but Gregory doesn't slap it.
C: GREGORY
D: Can I ask you something?
C: MALCOLM
D: Sure, man.
C: GREGORY
D: Are you Elijah's pimp?
C: MALCOLM
D: What?
C: GREGORY
D: "His greatest greatness."
E: scornfully

S: 164 INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - NIGHT
N: Betty, pregnant with child, is in a chair -- a newspaper in her lap. Malcolm is in the other room, putting his last daughter to sleep. We hear him... ANGLE - BEDROOM
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: Okay, last hug.
N: As he enters, a smile on his face, but the concern of the evening clearly imprinted. He sits down heavily. Betty watches him carefully.
C: MALCOLM
D: Long day. Long night. Long year. Long ten years.
N: He smiles. She doesn't. MALCOLM (contd) Why are you looking at me like that?
C: BETTY
D: Because you're in trouble.
C: MALCOLM
D: How do you know?
N: She smiles.
C: BETTY
D: Dear heart, because I know you.
N: A pause.
C: MALCOLM
D: I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
C: BETTY
D: I'm not made of glass.
C: MALCOLM
D: I just want to sit here and be still.
C: BETTY
D: We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
C: MALCOLM
D: Talk about what?
C: BETTY
D: The talk is everywhere!
C: MALCOLM
D: There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
C: BETTY
D: We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
N: She picks up the newspaper and reads from it: BETTY (contd) "Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
C: MALCOLM
D: There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
C: BETTY
D: "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
C: MALCOLM
D: I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
C: BETTY
D: To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
C: MALCOLM
D: Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
N: Betty gets up, goes to him gently.
C: BETTY
D: No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
C: MALCOLM
D: I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
E: rationalizing
C: BETTY
D: Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
C: MALCOLM
D: Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
C: BETTY
D: A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
C: MALCOLM
D: Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
C: BETTY
D: What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
C: MALCOLM
D: The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
C: BETTY
D: Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
N: She touches him very gently. BETTY (contd) Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
C: MALCOLM
D: What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
C: BETTY
D: We need you too!
C: MALCOLM
D: What do you want me to do?
C: BETTY
D: Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.

D: This is Saudi, she's 3 and you have Lisha, she's 2. Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the father of my 3 children.
N: She touches her pregnant stomach. SISTER LUCILLE (contd) Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him. CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: He told you that?
C: SISTER LUCILLE
D: Yes sir.
C: MALCOLM
D: Are you sure?
C: SISTER LUCILLE
D: Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.

N: CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM He has said everything on his mind and waits for Bembry's answer. PAN TO BEMBRY
C: BEMBRY
D: What are you talking about -- "blackout"? Some of the Brothers are a little jealous. Maybe they think you been a little -- overpublicized. That's all. Forget it. It's nothing.
N: Malcolm is listening closely. Bembry puts an arm around him, man-to-man. BEMBRY (contd) Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
C: MALCOLM
D: "I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
E: quoting Bembry back to himself
C: BEMBRY
D: You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
N: Malcolm has to control his rage.
C: MALCOLM
D: We tell the world we're moral leaders because we follow the personal example of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. It's hard to make a rooster stop crowing once the sun has risen. The sun is up.

N: 168B SHOT - AMERICAN FLAGS AT HALF-MAST
C: MALCOLM
D: Both his Bible and the Holy Koran say: "As you sow, so shall you reap." Both say: "Sow the wind, reap the whirl wind."
N: SHOT - AMERICAN FLAGS AT HALF-MAST MALCOLM (contd) In the soil of America the white man planted the seeds of hate. He allowed the weeds that sprang up to choke the life out of thousands of black men. 168C SHOT - THE KENNEDY FUNERAL CORTEGE MALCOLM (contd) Now they have strangled one of the gardeners.

D: Minister X! Don't you have even a little bit of remorse... saddened by President Kennedy's assassination?
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM
C: MALCOLM
D: Assassination might be too good a word, and might I add an Arabic word at that. This was a prime example of the devil's chickens coming home to roost. Being an old farm boy myself, chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad. It always made me glad.
S: 169A INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
N: On his desk is the black headlines: MALCOLM X CALLS ASSASSINATION "CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST." Elijah's health is getting worse, his coughing is frequent.
C: ELIJAH
D: Did you see the papers today?
C: MALCOLM
D: Yes, sir, I did.
C: ELIJAH
D: That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
N: CLOSE - MALCOLM He knows what is coming. CLOSE - ELIJAH ELIJAH (contd) We must dissociate ourselves from your terrible blunder. I'll have to silence you for the next ninety days. You are not allowed to make any statements to the press nor are you to speak at any temples. CLOSER - MALCOLM He looks at Elijah, his leader, his friend, his father and speaks with total sincerity.
C: MALCOLM

C: SIDNEY
D: Another one?
C: MALCOLM
D: How long has this been going on?
C: SIDNEY
D: All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
C: MALCOLM
D: What mission?
C: SIDNEY
D: To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
C: MALCOLM
D: What does Sidney say?
C: SIDNEY
D: I'm with you, Brother Minister.
C: MALCOLM
D: No. You'll be marked for death.
C: SIDNEY
D: Let me die then.
C: MALCOLM
D: I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.

S: 173 INT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY
N: Malcolm -- backed by Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X -- faces a roomful of SUPPORTERS and REPORTERS.
C: MALCOLM
D: Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I have called this press conference, this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle -- especially in regards to politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own free will. But now that it has happened, I intend to make the most of it. Now that I have more independence of action, I intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem. I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organizations. We must find a common solution, to a common problem. I am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. Our political philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but they can't join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity.
N: A host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers will join you? etc, etc, etc. Malcolm calms them: MALCOLM (contd) There is one further preparation I need. It is a return to the source of our great religion. I will make a pilgrimage to Mecca.

S: 177 INT/EXT. MECCA - DAY/NIGHT
N: --Malcolm, wearing the garb of a pilgrim, walks with a VAST THRONG OF OTHERS, similarly clad, around the Great Temple. He wears two white towels, one over his loins, the other over his neck and shoulder, leaving the right arm and shoulder bare. He wears simple sandals. The other pilgrims are of various colors: from white, to yellow, to darkest black. 177A --Malcolm and OTHER PILGRIMS kneeling together on a praying rug. 177B --Malcolm and SEVERAL WHITE PILGRIMS eating Muslim-style; breaking a chicken and shaking it. 177C --Malcolm and OTHERS walking around the Great Kaaba, a black stone set in the middle of the Great Mosque. He falls to his knees. WE SEE what he describes:
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt like a complete human being.
S: 178 INT. ELIJAH'S HOME - NIGHT
N: Elijah and a GROUP OF BLACK MUSLIM LEADERS. Bembry among them, it looks like he is the number two man now that Malcolm has been jettisoned. The Messenger lies in bed, he is having a coughing fit, this is the worst condition he's been in. A DOCTOR orders everyone out the room.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: You may be shocked by these words, but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It has happened again...
S: 179 INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - NIGHT
N: Betty is with Brothers Earl, Benjamin 2X, and the children. There are now four including another BABY - GAMILAH
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: In the past, I have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people.
N: 179A SHOT. Malcolm is bent over in prayer, lone figure in a huge mosque.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights.
N: 179B SHOT. Malcolm on a plane headed home.
C: MALCOLM'S VOICE
D: I believe the true practice of Islam can remove the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls of white Americans.

N: A TIGHT TWO-SHOT of Malcolm and Betty in an embrace. She breaks from him and whispers: "Go ahead. I can wait now."
S: 181 INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY
N: A large PRESS CONFERENCE: mikes of every network, every newspaper and wire service present. Malcolm sports a beard.
C: MALCOLM
D: Let's begin.
N: REPORTER #1 Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.
C: MALCOLM
D: As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society. Muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family. Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white.
N: REPORTER #8 Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United Nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the United States for its treatment of the American Negroes?
C: MALCOLM
D: Oh yes.
N: The AUDIENCE applauds. MALCOLM (contd) The audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I pointed out that during my trip that nations, African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very hypocritical when they stand up in the UN condemning South Africa and saying nothing about the racist practices that are manifested everyday against Negroes in this society. I would be not a man if I didn't do so. I wouldn't be a man. REPORTER #3 Are you prepared to work with some of the leaders of some of the other civil rights organizations?
C: MALCOLM
D: Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results.
N: REPORTER #1 Does the new beard have any religious significance?
C: MALCOLM
D: No, not particularly. But I do think that you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own.
N: REPORTER #2 One of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor that for self-defense?
C: MALCOLM
D: I don't see why that should be controversial. I think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves.
N: REPORTER #2 What about the guns, Malcolm?
C: MALCOLM
D: Has the white man changed since I went away? Have you put up your guns? The day you stop being violent against my people will be the day I tell folks to put away their guns.
N: REPORTER #3 Then you're still an extremist? ANGLE - MUSLIM MALE

C: OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE
D: Here at this final hour, in this quiet place, Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes, extinguished now and gone from us forever.
N: 200C DOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor, waiting to see Malcolm's body, where it lies before burial. OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd) For Harlem is where he worked, and where he struggled and fought. His home of homes, where his heart was and where his people are. And it is therefore most fitting that we meet once again in Harlem to share these last moments with him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to those who loved her, have fought for her and defended her honor even to death. It is not in the memory of man that this beleaguered, unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has found a braver, more gallant young champion than this Afro-American who lies before us unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain and we will smile and we will answer and say unto them: 2OOD SHOTS - FACES OF HARLEM - PRESENT DAY - THE 90'S Ordinary PEOPLE in ordinary pursuits of life, BLACK PEOPLE still struggling to stay afloat in a racist WHITE AMERICA that does not have their best interests at hand -- 8 years of Reagan and now at least 4 years of Bush. OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you have him smile at you? Did you ever listen to him? Did he ever really do a mean thing? Was he ever associated with violence or any public disturbance? 200E SHOT - STREET SIGN - MALCOLM X BOULEVARD - HARLEM 200F SHOT - YOUNG AFRO-CENTRIC TEENAGERS WITH MALCOLM X T-SHIRTS, HATS, JACKETS, JEWELRY, ETC. OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) For if you did, you would know him and if you knew him, you would know why we must honor him. 200G SHOT - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF THE _REAL_ MALCOLM X OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) Malcolm was our manhood, our living black manhood. That was his meaning to his people and in honoring him we honor the best in ourselves. 200H FREEZE FRAME - A CLOSE-UP OF THE REAL MALCOLM X SMILING RIGHT AT US.
