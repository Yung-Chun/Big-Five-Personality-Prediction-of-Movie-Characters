M: South Park:
T: Bigger, Longer and Uncut
N: By Trey Parker Matt Stone Pam Brady Eighth Draft January 21, 1999
T: FADE IN:
N: Very happy, Disneyesque MUSIC swirls in. PAN DOWN from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town nestled in the hills. A wooden sign tells us this is South Park.
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
N: Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as they walk by. It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'. A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.
C: STAN
D: I'm going to the movies To see the brighter side of life! I'm going to the movie Everything's gonna be alright! Forget all my troubles Put my own life on hold Let a studio tell me how I should view the world Where everything works out I love it that way I'm going to the movies The movies today!
N: Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.
S: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
N: We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes off. BRRRRRTTT!!!
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER
D: Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses and water the cows!!
N: From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet. We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his closet and pulls out an orange coat. The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.
C: MOTHER
D: KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!
E: O.S.
N: This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and hazel eyes.
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rm!
S: INT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
N: Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are sitting at the humble table.
C: KENNY'S MOTHER
D: Sit down, you can share some of your brother's waffle.
N: The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.
S: EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Kenny opens the door to find Stan.
C: STAN
D: Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is out! You wanna come?!
N: Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes light up.
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rm, rmph!
N: Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.
C: KENNY'S MOTHER
D: Kenny! Where're you going?
C: KENNY
D: Mph mprh mprh rm!
C: KENNY'S MOTHER
D: What do you mean you don't want to go to church?
C: KENNY
D: Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.
N: Kenny and Stan walk down the street.
C: KENNY'S MOTHER
D: Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And then when you die and go to hell you can ANSWER TO SATAN!!
N: Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And then walks off with Stan anyway.
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
N: Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the happy beat. TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his Rhinoplasty office.
C: TOM
D: Say, where are you boys going?
C: STAN
D: We're going to the movies! To see the brighter side of life! Where everyone is beautiful And have their hair combed just right!
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rm rmph rm! Mph rm rmph rm! Mprh rm rmph rm rm Rmph rm rmph rm rmph!
C: TOM
D: Have fun you rascals!
S: EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Kenny and Stan knock at the door. A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.
C: KYLE
D: Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
C: STAN
D: Kyle, check it out.
N: Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.
C: KYLE
D: OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!
N: Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then, Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian boy bounces up next to him.
C: KYLE
D: No, Ike! You can't come with me!
N: Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
C: KYLE
D: Aw, ma!!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Do as I say, Kyle!
N: Kyle's mother closes the door.
C: KYLE
D: Damn it!!
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
N: Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the street and sing in unison.
C: BOYS
D: We're going to the movies To see the better side of life Where something interesting happens Every day and night!
C: KYLE
D: In movies we can pretend That love is real and good always wins-
C: STAN
D: We can even make believe marriages last!
N: A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.
C: HOMELESS GUY
D: Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?
N: Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy suddenly jumps up.
C: HOMELESS GUY
D: I'm going to the movies! To see the brighter side of life! I'm going to the movies Everything's gonna be alright! Forget my troubles Put my own life on hold Let a studio tell me how to view the world!
C: KYLE
D: Let's go get fat ass!
S: EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY
N: This house looks just like all the others.
S: INT. THAT SAME HOUSE
N: CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises them -- BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN who chows down on the chips. Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch, eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television. The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.
C: CARTMAN
D: MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!
N: CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Look, Eric it's your little friends.
C: CARTMAN
D: What the hell are you guys doing here?
C: IKE
D: Baba turtre bad!
N: Kyle holds up the newspaper ad.
C: CARTMAN
D: Ooh!
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE
N: Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and singing.
C: BOYS
D: We're going to the movies To see the better side of life!
C: CARTMAN
D: Maybe there'll be pirates! Or a whole city burnin'! Maybe we'll see a monster Or, better yet, Uma Thurman!
C: BOYS
D: We're going to the movies! Everything's gonna be okay!
N: The boys skip out of frame.
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
N: The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South Park buildings. The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.
C: BOYS
D: Going to the movies! The movies today!!!!!
C: STAN
D: Can I get five tickets to Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire, please?
C: TICKET GUY
D: No.
N: Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film comes to an ABRUPT HALT. The boys look confused.
C: KYLE
D: What'dya mean, no?
C: TICKET GUY
D: Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.
N: The boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence.
C: CARTMAN
D: The hell we can't! My money is just as good as any white person's!
C: TICKET GUY
D: You have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
C: KYLE
D: But why?
C: TICKET GUY
D: Because this movie has naughty language, and it might make you kids start using bad words.
C: CARTMAN
D: Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't let us in to see this movie I'm gonna kick you square in the nuts.
C: TICKET GUY
D: Sorry, Charlie.
C: KYLE
D: Damn it!
C: TICKET GUY
D: Next, please?
N: A few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step aside.
C: STAN
D: This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
C: KYLE
D: We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
C: CARTMAN
D: Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
C: KYLE
D: Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
C: CARTMAN
D: Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
C: IKE
D: Poo baba!
C: STAN
D: Wait! I've got an idea!
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER
N: The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the Ticket Guy with the boys.
C: HOMELESS GUY
D: Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire.
C: TICKET GUY
D: You realize this movie is rated R? It may not be appropriate for your little ones.
C: HOMELESS GUY
D: Oh. Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate for you.
E: Turning to boys
C: STAN
D: Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of Vodka and not forget about how miserable your life is and not stop the voices in your head then go right ahead.
E: Whispering
C: HOMELESS GUY
D: Five tickets please.
N: The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over.
S: INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
N: The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink.
C: IKE
D: Purpre mama!
C: KYLE
D: Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
N: ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire'
C: BOYS
D: HOORAY!!!
N: On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome Canadian star with a great body.
C: PHILLIP
D: Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest say to the Uranian gynecologist?
N: PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally handsome in a more rugged way.
C: TERRANCE
D: I don't know, Phillip, what?
N: Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. ANGLE - BOYS Laughing their asses off.
C: KYLE
D: That was sweet!
C: STAN
D: Where do they come up with this stuff?!
C: CARTMAN
D: How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?

D: Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they said?
N: ANGLE - SCREEN Terrance pulls out a white envelope.
C: TERRANCE
D: Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
C: PHILLIP
D: A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
N: TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from the film enters their innocent ears.
C: TERRANCE
D: It's from your mother.
C: PHILLIP
D: My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
C: TERRANCE
D: It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
N: Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
C: PHILLIP
D: Oh, you fucking ball whore!
N: The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy taking it all in.
C: CARTMAN
D: Wow... Ball whore...

N: TERRANCE & PHILLIP Unclefucka! That's YOUUUUUUU!!!!! The song ends and the boys erupt into applause.
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
N: The boys walk out of the theatre with glazed eyes and wide smiles.
C: KYLE
D: Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
C: CARTMAN
D: You bet your fucking ass it was!
C: STAN
D: Fuck, dude, I wanna be just like Terrance and Phillip!
C: TICKET GUY
D: Hey wait a minute... Where's your guardian?
C: STAN
D: Huh?
C: TICKET GUY
D: I knew it! You PAID a homeless guy to get you in, didn't you!
N: The boys think a second.
C: CARTMAN
D: Suck my balls.
C: KYLE
D: Yeah, Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!
E: Singing
N: The boys walk away, merrily. The ticket guy is in shock.
C: TICKET GUY
D: Oh oh, I'm in trouble.
C: BOYS
D: You're an asslicking, ball sucking Unclefucka!!
E: Singing, fading off
S: EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY
N: All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for ice skating. The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the Charlie Brown Christmas special. Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and joyous music plays. The boys walk up to the pond.
C: CLYDE
D: Hey, where have you guys been all day?
C: STAN
D: Oh, nowhere... We just went out to go see the TERRANCE AND PHILLIP MOVIE!
N: All the kids gasp! Dramatic MUSIC STING.
C: BEBE
D: You saw it?!
C: CLYDE
D: How'd you get in?!
N: Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. They're like celebrities.
C: CARTMAN
D: Hey! Stop crowding us you shitfaced cockmasters!
N: All the kids stop, wide eyed. As if they've just hear the voice of God.
C: KIDS
D: Wowwww...
C: STAN
D: Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming unclefuckers.
C: KIDS
D: Ooooohhh!!!
C: CLYDE
D: We HAVE to see this movie, dude.
E: To another kid
N: The other kids nod.
C: CARTMAN
D: Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal wart! Stan? Stan?
N: But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER. The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's. All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all stop to admire her. Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what he's looking at.
C: STAN
D: Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...
C: KYLE
D: Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
N: ANGLE - WENDY Spinning and soaring in slo-mo. Effortlessly covering every inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers. Stan is slack-jawed.
C: STAN
D: I can't stop now My heart's awake I pray her arms my arms to take So this is why I'm ali-
N: Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face and abruptly ending his song.
C: WENDY
D: Hi, Stan!
N: Stan vomits profusely all over himself.
C: WENDY
D: Ew! Gross!
N: Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He speaks with a rich English accent.
C: GREGORY
D: Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly brush.
N: Stan looks at Gregory.
C: STAN
D: Who are you, kid?
C: GREGORY
D: My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
C: WENDY
D: Want to skate with us?
C: GREGORY
D: We've been skating all morning. And laughing and talking of memories past.
N: Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to get Wendy's attention.
C: STAN
D: We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
C: WENDY
D: That's nice, Stan.
N: Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.
C: KYLE
D: Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
C: STAN
D: She's not my girlfriend, dude!
N: Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around Cartman.
C: CARTMAN
D: Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip movie. Who wants to touch me? I said, "Who wants to touch me?!"
N: A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's arm.
C: SMALL BOY
D: Oooooh...
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING
N: Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background. It's a brand new day.
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY
N: The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two mountain peaks.
S: INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY
N: The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.
C: KIDS
D: Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're a shitsucking, cocksucking Unclefucka!!
N: The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down. CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to be speaking.
C: MR. HAT
D: Okay, children, let's take our seats.
N: As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality. MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT) We have a lot to learn and precious little time. Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt, except, of course, for Wendy.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of Sigfried and Roy?
C: KYLE
D: It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison, it's Terrance and Phillip.
C: KIDS
D: TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!
N: Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan sulks.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
N: MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT) That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
C: CARTMAN
D: I hate the environment.
C: KYLE
D: Dude, how can you hate the environment?
C: CARTMAN
D: 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
N: The kids all GASP!
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
C: CARTMAN
D: Fragile?
C: KYLE
D: No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Kyle!
C: CARTMAN
D: Why the fuck not?
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Eric!
C: STAN
D: Dude, you just said fuck again.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Stanly!
C: KENNY
D: Mph.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Kenny!
C: CARTMAN
D: That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip can say something, I should be able to say it too!
C: BEBE
D: Wow, Cartman's cool!
C: CLYDE
D: He's like Terrance and Phillip!
N: Cartman gloats proudly.
C: CARTMAN
D: Fuckin' a right.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: How would you like to go to the principal's office?
C: CARTMAN
D: How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
N: Mr. Garrison is in shock.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
C: CARTMAN
D: I said -
N: Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.
C: CARTMAN
D: HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!
E: Through megaphone
N: Garrison is floored.
C: KYLE
D: Oh, dude we are fucked now.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.
C: STAN
D: Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
C: KYLE
D: Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
N: Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA, a frizzy haired woman of about forty.
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: I am VERY disappointed in you boys! You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've already called in your parents, but first I want you to THINK about what you've done.
C: CARTMAN
D: Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?
C: PRINCPAL VICTORIA
D: What?
C: CARTMAN
D: What's the big fucking deal?
C: STAN
D: Yeah.
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: AGH!! I want to know where you heard these horrific obscenities!
N: The boys look at each other.
C: STAN
D: Nowhere.
C: KYLE
D: I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
C: STAN
D: Yeah!
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison ever said- 'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker' in school!
E: Reading
N: The boys all laugh. But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.
C: STAN
D: Oh, oh...
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: Thank you all for coming on such short notice. As you can see, your boys are all being disciplined.
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: This just isn't like you, Stanley!
N: Stan looks down at the floor.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: No, it was worse than that...
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: The F word?!
E: Gasping
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
N: The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their eyes bulge.
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: Oh dear God...
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: What is 'fisting'?
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: That's when the fist is inserted into the anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.
N: The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: What?
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
E: To Kyle
C: KYLE
D: I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
C: CARTMAN
D: It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
C: STAN
D: Dude!
C: CARTMAN
D: What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: What is Terrance and Phillip?
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
C: CARTMAN
D: Everybody's already fucking seen it.
C: MS. CARTMAN
D: Eric!
C: CARTMAN
D: I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie has warped my fragile little mind.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and let us adults speak.
N: The boys get up and walk out. Kyle's mother slams the door behind them.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: We must take action on this immediately.
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft? As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
N: A look of shock comes over the principal's face.
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: Article 42! You don't mean-?!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you.
C: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
D: But I-
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
N: Kyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Get out of that chair! The PTA is in charge now!
S: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
N: The other school kids are in line for lunch. Just then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through the P.A.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Attention students. We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.
N: The kids look down. They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip shirts.

N: A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed. The TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'.
C: NEWS ANCHOR
D: Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or is it Canada?
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Canada!
C: NEWS ANCHOR
D: Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the Canadian Minister of Movies.
N: A split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a goofy looking Canadian slides into the other.
C: NEWS ANCHOR
D: Thank you, Minister, for joining us.
C: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
D: Thanks for having me, buddy.
C: NEWS ANCHOR
D: Minister, parents all over America are concerned about your country's entertainment. Your thoughts?
C: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
D: Well, the film is R rated, and it's not intended for children-
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
C: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
D: Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
C: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
D: Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
C: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
D: Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
C: NEWS ANCHOR
D: But minister, it isn't like this film is the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams a few decades ago.
N: The Minister thinks.
C: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
D: What?
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them! Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
S: INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
N: The boys are in the front row, this time with Wendy, watching the Terrance and Phillip movie.
C: TERRANCE
D: Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
C: PHILLIP
D: I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
N: The boys laugh merrily. Wendy just looks bored.
C: TERRANCE
D: Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
C: PHILLIP
D: You bet, Terrance!
N: Terrance pulls out a match, lights it, then farts. The flame burns Terrance to a blackened mass.
C: PHILLIP
D: HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
C: TERRANCE
D: I sure did, Phillip!!
E: Just a skull
N: The boys laugh hysterically.

C: CARTMAN
D: No way.
C: STAN
D: Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
C: WENDY
D: Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
C: STAN
D: WHAT?!
C: CARTMAN
D: Oh shit.
C: WENDY
D: It's just... It's obvious that we don't have a whole lot in common anymore. I need somebody who's... a little deeper.
C: STAN
D: But Wendy, I can go-
N: Wendy places her little gloved hand over Stan's mouth.
C: WENDY
D: No. Don't speak. You'll only make things more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.
N: And just like that, Wendy is gone. Stan looks almost ready to cry. Kyle walks up behind Stan.
C: KYLE
D: Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
C: STAN
D: Yeah...
E: Insincere
N: The boys walk off.

C: CARTMAN
D: Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
C: KENNY
D: Mph mm!
N: Kenny pulls out a book of matches. He strikes a match and holds it under his ass. After a few seconds Kenny farts, and there is a little flame. Suddenly, the flames catch and Kenny starts burning alive.
C: KENNY
D: MMMPMMPH!!! MGMFEODFO!!!
N: Kenny runs around, and finally falls to the ground, still burning.
C: STAN
D: OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
C: KYLE
D: YOU BASTARD!!
N: Cartman looks shocked.
C: CARTMAN
D: Wow, I guess you CAN do that!
S: INT. HOSPITAL - LATER
N: DOCTORS and NURSES are pushing Kenny into the operating room ER style. Everything is quick and chaotic. Shouts fill the hallway.
C: NURSE
D: CBC chem kit STAT!!
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: LOAD THAT I.V. WITH 70CCS OF SODIUM PENTOTHAL!!
S: INT. OPERATING ROOM
N: It's mid-operation.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum!
N: Another nurse hands him a sucker tube. He immediately shoves into Kenny's skull. It starts to slurp and burble.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Try to untangle his trachea and esophagus!
C: NURSE
D: Right!
N: While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso, the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside out in the process. Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!!
C: NURSE
D: Watch his liver!!!
N: Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the floor.
C: ASSISTANT
D: I'll get it!!!
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: We have precious little time left people! We're going to lose him soon!!
N: Suddenly, there is a long, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.
C: NURSE
D: Doctor, his heart's stopped!
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Crack him. Let's get it out of there!!!
N: Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: We need to zap this, quick!
N: And runs it to the microwave. He opens the door.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Who's making a potato?
N: DOCTOR 2 My bad, sir. I missed lunch.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this kid!!!!!!
S: INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER
N: Fade up from black. We're close on Kenny's face. His little eyes start to open. Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny. Stan and Kyle are there.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Kenny. Kenny, can you hear me?
N: Kenny stirs.

D: How are you feeling, son?
C: KENNY
D: mph.... rmph....
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Great... Son, I have some bad news. We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have about seven seconds to live.
C: KENNY
D: Mrm?!
N: Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle.
C: STAN
D: Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
C: KYLE
D: You bastards!!
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Damn it! It never gets any easier! Anybody get the score of that Broncos game?
S: INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

D: Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
C: KENNY'S DAD

C: PARENTS
D: Yeah!!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: COME ON!
N: The parents all head out the door-
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
N: The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march out into the street, singing in unison as they go.
C: PARENTS
D: Something must be done! Something's gotta give! This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live!
E: Singing
N: Cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the middle of the road. People start honking their horns in frustration.
C: KENNY'S MOTHER
D: My boy could have become a doctor Or a lawyer rich and true Instead he burned up like a piggy on a bar-b-que!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: We will fight for children's rights in memory of your son!
C: PARENTS
D: We can't just stand here singing! Something must be done!
N: Cars are now smashing into each other, and flying off the road to people's deaths, as the music number has taken over the busy intersection.
C: PARENTS
D: We've pushed and pushed it to the edge And now the time has come! Something's gotta change! It's time to buy a gun! We can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing! Something must be done!!!
N: A few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if ending the song with a borage of fireworks.
S: INT. OPERATING ROOM -
N: The boys gather around Kenny's lifeless body.
C: CARTMAN
D: I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
E: Dazed
C: KYLE
D: Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
C: CARTMAN
D: No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
C: KYLE
D: Oh.
N: The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind. We can still hear the boys voices as they exit.
C: KYLE
D: I can't believe he's dead.
E: O.S.
C: CARTMAN
D: Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
E: O.S.
N: After they leave, PUSH IN to Kenny's dead body, which is left all alone on the operating table. The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face... ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs... FLASH!!
S: EXT. SPACE -
N: Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens. *note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body, this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI. Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears warm and inviting. Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them. Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost close enough to the light to touch it. Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'. Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to become darker and more twisted. Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled with flames and heat.
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rm!
N: Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell. Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel. He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
N: The same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth. The marquee still reads 'Terrance and Phillip' but a huge sticker has been placed over it that reads 'banned'. The boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled.
C: STAN
D: How can they do this?
C: KYLE
D: It isn't fair!
C: CARTMAN
D: Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan O'Brian tonight, we could at least go watch that.
N: The boys hang their heads and walks away. The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion. He sees a mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: THIS must be him, officer! This is the scum that sold R rated tickets to children!
C: TICKET GUY
D: What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!
N: Barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen.
C: OFFICER BARBRADY
D: You can explain downtown!
C: TICKET GUY
D: Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You should arrest those pervert Canadians!
E: Getting dragged away

C: CONAN O'BRIAN
D: So, guys, I need to ask you a serious question...
E: Nervous
C: PHILLIP
D: I just farted Terrance back into the stone age!

C: TERRANCE
D: Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!
C: CONAN O'BRIAN

C: KYLE
D: I don't really think you need Cheesy- Poofs, tubby-
N: But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for them, silently. Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's mother's face looks almost evil.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
C: KYLE
D: We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and Phillip?

C: MR. MACKEY
D: Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.

D: Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.

C: MR. MACKEY
D: There are times when you get suckered in, by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en. But it's when you do these things too much That you've got to clear your head and get back in touch...

N: The kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a chalkboard.
C: MR. MACKEY
D: Step one: Think about fun. Think about all that you'll miss addicted to this Step two: Think it all through. Think how's this gonna change my life, what am I gonna miss? Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug anything that gets in your way! And step four: Just don't do it anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

N: Kenny's mother steps into frame. She is wearing a shirt with Kenny's picture on it. Written on the T-shirt is 'Have you seen my son? No, you haven't. He's dead.'
C: NEWS REPORTER
D: Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the Canadians.

S: INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER
N: The children all listen, wide-eyed.
S: INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY
C: TERRANCE
D: The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
C: PHILLIP
D: Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER

D: Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to pass gas near your head.
C: DUBBED TERRANCE
D: I would rather you didn't, Phillip.
C: DUBBED PHILLIP
D: Oh? Is that so?
N: Phillip farts on Terrance.
C: TERRANCE
D: Oh, you are such a maroon!
C: PHILLIP
D: You would know, dummy.
N: The boys look confused.
C: TERRANCE
D: You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.
N: The pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh. Terrance throws a match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death. A TITLE comes up - THE END. And the credits roll.
C: CARTMAN
D: WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
C: KYLE
D: Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
N: The lights in the theater come up.
C: MR. MACKEY
D: So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
C: CARTMAN
D: Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
C: MR. MACKEY

C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
C: MR. MACKEY
D: Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
E: Nervous
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
N: Dramatic MUSIC STING. Mackey looks afraid.
C: MR. MACKEY
D: Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER

C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: As our next official order of business here at M.A.C., we will test the new V- chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was created to lock children out of watching certain shows on television. And now the N.I.H. has created a new, exciting product that they can tell us all about. Here is the Surgeon General, Dr. Pangloss.
N: DOCTOR PANGLOSS, a lab technician in white takes the podium.
C: DOCTOR PANGLOSS
D: Thank you, parents.
N: One person claps. Pangloss hits a button and a slide projector starts showing pictures of the device.
C: DOCTOR PANGLOSS
D: The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very simple, and similar to that of the V- chip. The chip is placed just under the subject's skin, where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered.
N: The parents are fascinated.
C: STAN'S FATHER
D: Now wait a minute, are you telling us that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid is swearing?
C: DOCTOR PANGLOSS
D: It's just like a lie detector. Certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie, the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock.
N: The parents AD LIB 'Ooohs' and 'Ahhhhs'
C: DOCTOR PANGLOSS
D: We are very excited to see the results of this test. Patient 453, would you step out here, please?
E: Calling

D: Pillow.
C: DOCTOR PANGLOSS
D: Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
N: Cartman looks offstage to his mother.
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Go ahead, it's alright, Eric.
N: Cartman smiles.
C: CARTMAN
D: Horsefuck-
N: BZZZZZAAAAT!!!!

C: STAN
D: Hey, what are you doing?

D: What do we do? Do we go on as normal or...?
C: MR. GARRISON
D: I don't know Principal Victoria... I don't know...
C: PRESIDENT
D: And now, I would like to bring up the woman who led, and is still leading the way in this glorious stand-
C: KYLE
D: HOLY SHIT DUDE!!
E: Pointing to TV
N: Kyle's mom appears on the TV dressed in military garb.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.
C: CHEF
D: Isn't that your mother, Kyle?
N: Kyle can't believe it. On the television, Kyle's mother walks up to the podium. She is dressed to the hilt. She hugs the President and the first lady and then takes a deep breath.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada. Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
C: PRESIDENT
D: As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: What about air strikes?
C: PRESIDENT
D: Huh?
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers. It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
C: PRESIDENT
D: Oh, uh... I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Not necessary?! Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
N: A huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of Kyle's mother. She is obviously floored by it. She can't help but smile. She actually holds her head up higher, and then raises her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder. The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the rest of the crowd. Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed.
C: CHEF
D: Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle.
C: CARTMAN
D: Amen to that.
S: INT. HELL - DAY
N: Kenny is sadly walking around hell. He walks up to another one of hell's prisoners.
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
C: GEORGE BURNS
D: Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores? Beat it, kid.
N: Kenny moves along. He hears some voices coming from a door. Kenny opens the door and peeps inside-
S: INT. SATAN'S BEDROOM - KENNY'S POV
N: Saddam and Satan are lying in bed.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all. I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
C: SATAN
D: I'm not cranky. And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
N: Just then, Satan hears a reporter on CNN.
C: TV
D: In war news, countries from Europe and Asia are joining sides in the Canadian- American War-
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and forget about the whole thing-
C: SATAN
D: SHHH!!!!
C: TV
D: ...The death count is already on its way to 10 million with no signs of slowing down. What started as a spat between the United States and Canada is quickly turning into World War III-
N: Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks off the television and sits up in bed.
C: SATAN
D: It has come to be... The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh! The time of the prophecy is upon us!
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan. You know exactly how to turn my crank!
C: SATAN
D: No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
N: Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient tome. Satan turns the pages as he talks.
C: SATAN
D: Behold, the signs of my reign on earth are all falling into place! The fall of an empire-
N: He points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of Ceasar.
C: SATAN
D: -The coming of a comet-
N: He points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth.
C: SATAN
D: Jerry Springer's movie doing more than ten million box office-
N: A picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money.
C: SATAN
D: ....And now....
N: Satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall. It looks like Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head.
C: SATAN
D: The seventh sign! When the blood of these Canadians touches American soil... It will be my time to rise!!!!!
N: DRAMATIC music.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Yeah! YEAH!!! Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
C: SATAN
D: Do you always think about sex? I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
C: SATAN
D: Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
N: Saddam thinks for a second.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: I love you.
N: Satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: You know I do.
C: SATAN
D: I know.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
N: Satan reaches over and turns off the light. Everything goes pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well. A beat. Then, a small moan from Satan.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
N: Stan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue. Stan is reading out of a huge book.
C: KYLE
D: Does it say what the clitoris is?
C: STAN
D: All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
C: KYLE
D: Isn't that in Arizona or something?
N: Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away. The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it starts to burn. Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing.
C: STAN
D: What is this?
C: CARTMAN
D: They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
C: STAN
D: That book wasn't Canadian!
N: Clyde, one of the kids from school, throws his Terrance and Phillip dolls into the burning mass. Kyle stops him on his way back.
C: KYLE
D: Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip anymore?
C: CLYDE
D: Of course not! We're at war! My daddy says I HATE Canadians now!
N: More kids line up to burn their Terrance and Phillip stuff. Several random mothers from M.A.C. are standing in front of the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and T-shirts. The boys' parents aren't around, but another MAC mother is leading the charge.
C: MAC MOTHER
D: THAT'S IT! BURN EVERYTHING CANADIAN!!! MAKE OUR COUNTRY DECENT AGAIN FOR OUR CHILDREN!!!
N: A townsperson throws Alanis Morisette albums into the fire. Another townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of Cheesy Poofs.
C: CARTMAN
D: NNOOOO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! OH, WHY GOD, WHY?!
N: Cartman falls to his knees and cries as the Cheesy Poofs burn away.
C: CARTMAN
D: This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch- AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
E: BBBZAATT!!
C: KYLE
D: And she's getting worse...
C: STAN
D: Dude... Isn't that your brother?
N: Kyle looks to where a group of big, mean FIFTH GRADERS have encircled Ike.
C: FIFTH GRADER
D: Why don't you go back to your own country, CANADIAN!
N: FIFTH GRADER 2 Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride donkeys!
C: IKE
D: Eee todo ba!
N: Kyle's eyes grow wide. He dashes over.
C: KYLE
D: Hey! Leave him alone!
C: FIFTH GRADER
D: It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like rats.
C: KYLE
D: He's my brother!
C: FIFTH GRADER
D: You don't look Canadian.
C: KYLE
D: He's adopted!
N: Kyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him.
C: FIFTH GRADER
D: Well you better get his beady eyed Canadian ass out of America before my daddy finds him!!
N: The boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and throw more Canadian items into the fire.
C: KYLE
D: It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
C: STAN
D: What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
C: CARTMAN
D: -no Cheesy Poofs.
C: STAN
D: -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
N: DRAMATIC MUSIC begins.
C: KYLE
D: I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it! Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!
E: Singing
C: STAN
D: I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight! Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!
E: Singing
C: CARTMAN
D: And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!
C: STAN
D: But what are we going to do against this entire army?
C: KYLE
D: We've gotta get the word out. We'll get on my dad's computer and use the internet! Come on you guys!
N: The boys proudly head down the street.
C: BOYS
D: Something must be done! Something's gotta give! This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live!
N: (*note- cartman gets shocked again on 'bitch')
C: BOYS
D: We've pushed it to the edge And now the time has come! Something's gotta change! Something must be done! Something must be done!!!
S: INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - KYLE'S DAD'S OFFICE
N: Kyle is at the keyboard of his dad's computer. Stan and Cartman are waiting in the background.
C: KYLE
D: Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
C: STAN
D: Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
C: KYLE
D: Okay...
N: Kyle types in the word and hits return.
C: KYLE
D: "Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
E: Reading the screen
C: STAN
D: Wow!
C: KYLE
D: I'll just try the first one.
N: Kyle clicks the mouse. They wait for the screen to load. Finally, it does.
C: KYLE
D: Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a horse!
N: Stan and Cartman rush over.
C: STAN
D: Is it Cartman's mom?
C: CARTMAN
D: Very funny!
C: KYLE
D: Hey... It IS Cartman's mom!!
N: Cartman looks at the screen.
C: CARTMAN
D: Oh, son of a bitch! AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
E: ZZAP!!
C: STAN
D: Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
N: Ike bounces in, happily.
C: IKE
D: Ber dada!
C: KYLE
D: Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
C: IKE
D: Papa mama simi.
N: Ike bounces out.
C: CARTMAN
D: Come on, just get to the message board!
C: KYLE
D: I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
N: Kyle furiously hits a bunch of keys.
C: KYLE
D: Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll try to reroute the encryptions...
N: Kyle furiously hits a bunch more keys.
C: STAN
D: Dude, do you know what you're doing?
C: KYLE
D: No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
N: Just then the screen pops up. Access Granted.
C: KYLE
D: Bingo. Okay, here we go... Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
E: Typing
C: CARTMAN
D: Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
C: KYLE
D: We're not gonna have pie and punch!
C: CARTMAN
D: More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
C: KYLE
D: pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
E: Typing
N: The boys all think...
C: STAN
D: La Resistance.
E: Dramatically
N: Triumphant MUSIC cue.
S: INT. KYLE'S ATTIC
N: The door to the attic pops open. Kyle shoves Ike up into the attic.
C: KYLE
D: You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
C: IKE
D: Uhh...
C: KYLE
D: Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
N: The door closes and it is dark. Ike blinks. He looks out a small window, onto the street below. A few armed soldiers walk by. Ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to play.
S: INT. PENTAGON - NIGHT
N: Tons of MILITARY PERSONNEL are running to and fro. Giant computer screens show Canada's latest attacks.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des Moines!!
C: PRESIDENT
D: How can you tell?
N: Everyone laughs merrily.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Good one, sir!
N: Suddenly, a PENTAGON GUY runs up to the President, holding some papers.
C: PENTAGON GUY
D: Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing into Canadian computers! It looks like we may have a resistance movement starting...
N: The President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms behind her back and her chest out. She has a few military badges on her.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
E: Showing her the papers
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Well find out where that signal is coming from! Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
C: PRESIDENT
D: Yes ma'am!
N: The President starts to run off.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: And Bill?
C: PRESIDENT
D: Yes?
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: I'm needing lunch.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Right away, ma'am!
N: The president runs off.
S: EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Establishing.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER
D: And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as more and more troops are needed to fight the Canadian forces...
E: V.O.
S: INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Cartman's mother is tucking him into bed.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER
D: What is quickly being referred to as 'The Great Canadian-American War' has already reached a death toll of two million.
E: V.O.
N: Cartman's mother reaches over and switches off the radio.
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Goodnight, honey.
C: CARTMAN
D: Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
C: CARTMAN
D: Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Oh.
N: With that, Cartman's mother gets up-
C: CARTMAN
D: Mom...
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Yes, hon?
C: CARTMAN
D: If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Sure, hon. Goodnight.
N: She switches off the light, and leaves. Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and thinks. He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but then tries to close his eyes to sleep.
C: CARTMAN
D: Go away, scary noise.
N: Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see - KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed. Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream. Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he makes no sound. Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry. Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny disappears.
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
C: CARTMAN
D: I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
N: Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms.
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
C: CARTMAN
D: I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!! AGH! I can't say pissed off?! AGH!!
E: BZZTZT! BAZZTZT!!
S: INT. HELL - DAY (MOVED)
N: Kenny is again snooping around. He quietly creaks Satan's door open and walks in. Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth.
C: SATAN
D: The execution of Terrance and Phillip is imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!
N: Kenny looks scared.
C: SATAN
D: Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for the souls of your pitiful friends that-
E: Evil and scary
N: Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Hey Satan! I got some great new home furnishings today!
N: Satan rolls his eyes and sighs. His attempt to be evil to Kenny is squashed again.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get something to match with that bathroom tile!
N: Saddam looks at Kenny.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise! Well, keep lookin!
N: A beat. Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed.
C: SATAN
D: Do you wanna know what I did today?
N: Saddam lets out a sigh.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: What did you do today Satan?
C: SATAN
D: You don't care.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Hey fella! Relax! This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
C: SATAN
D: Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
C: SATAN
D: Don't call me dumb!
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
N: As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and forth as if watching a tennis match.
C: SATAN
D: How come you always want to make love to me from behind? Is it because you want to pretend I'm somebody else?
N: Saddam sighs.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?
N: A beat.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Come on, kid. Help me with these shower curtains.
N: Saddam and Kenny walk out. Leaving Satan all alone with sad music playing.
C: SATAN
D: Sometimes I think When I look up real high That there's a whole world up there And just maybe it could be mine But then, I sink because it's here I'm supposed to stay but I don't even know how or why its supposed to be that way-
E: Gently
N: Satan walks to his veranda.
C: SATAN
D: Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and live without a care... Up there
N: Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.
C: SATAN
D: They say I don't belong That my place is down below Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme? Without evil there could be no good So it must be good to be evil sometimes Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom. Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and life without a care... Up there
N: PULL BACK, big crane shot rising above Satan.
S: EXT. SMALL ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT
N: A dim light is all that is visible from inside the small building.
S: INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT
N: Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La Resistance'. Cartman comes running in, he looks scared.
C: KYLE
D: You're late, Cartman!
C: CARTMAN
D: I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
C: KYLE
D: Your behind?
C: CARTMAN
D: I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass- OW!!!
E: BBZZAATT
C: KYLE
D: Did you bring the pie and punch?
C: CARTMAN
D: No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy? I don't think Kenny is dead.
E: Looking over each shoulder
C: STAN
D: What?
C: CARTMAN
D: I saw him last night!
C: KYLE
D: I know Cartman, I know. I see Kenny every day.
C: CARTMAN
D: YOU DO?!
C: KYLE
D: Sure, dude. On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
N: Kyle and Stan laugh again.
C: CARTMAN
D: Hey! I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I think he's haunting me.
N: KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! The boys all look scared.
C: KYLE
D: Somebody's here...
N: The boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in front of their eyes.
C: KYLE
D: Who is it?
C: VOICE
D: Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
C: KYLE
D: What's the password?
C: VOICE
D: Uhh... I don't know.
C: KYLE
D: Guess.
C: VOICE
D: Uhh... Bacon.
C: KYLE
D: Okay.
N: Kyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab stands there looking handsome and angelic.
C: GREGORY
D: Viva la Resistance.
C: STAN
D: Oh no, it's that kid.
C: GREGORY
D: This is the place--
N: Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes grow wide.
C: STAN
D: Wendy?
C: WENDY
D: Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
C: GREGORY
D: Well, apparently you have a bigger heart than we thought. Let us get this meeting underway, there are others coming.
N: Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes.
S: INT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER
N: Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of twelve. The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall. Stan and Kyle look nervous.
C: STAN
D: Everyone be seated, please.
N: The kids all sit down.
C: KYLE
D: Wow, a lot of people showed up.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, so what do we say?
C: KYLE
D: I thought you had something planned.
C: STAN
D: Me?!
N: Stan looks out over the faces. Gregory checks his watch.
C: STAN
D: Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, and we think that sucks ass!!
E: Nervous
N: The kids don't respond. Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy, who is sitting next to Gregory.
C: STAN
D: Uhh... So we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA LA RESISTANCE!!!
N: Again no response. Gregory rolls his eyes.
C: STAN
D: Uhh...
N: Gregory stands up.
C: GREGORY
D: May I?
C: STAN
D: What?
N: Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group.
C: GREGORY
D: Terrance and Phillip are currently being held at a Canadian Internment camp two kilometers outside of town. They are to be executed tomorrow during a star-studded USO show for the troops.
N: Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan and Kyle can't believe it.
C: GREGORY
D: We must sneak into the camp through this duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip inside... The war is escalating, and the American forces are preparing for a large scale attack on Canada. That means the time is now...
C: KYLE
D: Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.
N: Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look.
C: GREGORY
D: This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go myself.
N: Wendy smiles at Gregory.
C: STAN
D: No!
N: Everyone looks at Stan.
C: STAN
D: WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
C: GREGORY
D: This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
C: CARTMAN
D: Fuck that! AGAGH!!
E: BZZT
C: STAN
D: We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
S: INT. SOUTH PARK - AMERICAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS
N: A huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different battalions. We see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat, Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather, Jesus, Officer Barbrady....
C: JIMBO
D: Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I was gettin' worried I'd never see another one!
C: NED
D: I know what you mean.
C: JIMBO
D: And they're giving all us troops a big USO tomorrow with celebrities and executions!
N: PAN OVER to Mr. Garrison.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: You look great in your new uniform Mr. Hat.
C: MR. HAT
D: You do too, Mr. Garrison.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Boy, I can't wait for our first shore- leave so I can go get me some poontang.
N: Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back. GENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps up to a podium and addresses the troops.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: PAY ATTENTION!
N: The crowd settles down.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: It's no secret that the Evil Canadian Federation has scored major victories all over the United State. We have brought you here because you ar America's best, and last hope.
N: Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his ear.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Oh... Apparently you're not the best, you're simply the last. Anyway, let's strategize... Map!
N: A large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in front of him. He walks around it pointing out things with a laser-pointer.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Our sources have told us that the Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's USO show and stop us from executing Terrance and Phillip.
N: He points to a spot on the 3-D map.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Now each battalion has a specific code- name and mission. Battalion 5, raise your hands-
N: Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand. Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that everybody else in his section is also African American.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: You will be the all-important first defense wave, which we will call 'Operation Human Shield'.
C: CHEF
D: Hey, wait a minute...
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human Shield' will suffer heavy losses. But don't lose your spirit men! Stay until the bitter end. Battalion 14?
N: A bunch of white guys raise their hands.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The Darkies'. You will follow Battalion 5 here-
N: He points to a spot on the 3-D map.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: -and try not to get killed for God's Sake. Are there any questions men?
N: Chef raises his hand.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Yes soldier?
C: CHEF
D: Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: I don't listen to hip-hop.
N: Chef scowls.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: If you somehow live, we will regroup on this hill outside--
N: Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Now what's wrong with this thing?
N: General Plymkin messes with the controls.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Fucking windows 98!
N: General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with the cord in his hands.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: GET GATES IN HERE!!!
N: BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS.

C: KYLE
D: Gotcha.
C: GREGORY
D: You are indeed brave, but you will need someone who's done this sort of thing before. MOLE!
N: Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out) The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops THE MOLE. He is a very bitter little nine year old French kid with a THICK French accent.

C: GREGORY
D: God has smiled upon you this day The fate of a nation in your hands...
N: Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled.
C: GREGORY
D: As brothers and sisters we unite And behind you we shall fight! Until only the most righteous belief stands!
N: The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox.
C: GREGORY
D: Do you see the distant flames? they bellow in the night Fight in all our names For what we know is right And if you all get shot and cannot carry on Though you die, La Resistance lives on!
C: KYLE
D: What? Shot?
N: Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join in the song.
C: KIDS

C: CHEF
D: Baby your thighs sparkle like diamonds Baby your butt is tender like the night I can see by the look in your pants that you want to treat me right. I'll whisper sweet nothings in your cleavage And you can kiss me gently with your tongue And I'll make love to you so deeply That you'll feel pressure clear up to your lungs.

N: Right out of Nazi Germany. Barbed wire, guards, the whole bit. ANGLE ON BOYS They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around the camp. The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes, clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman.
C: THE MOLE
D: Be careful not to touch this wire-
N: A wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face.

Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing in a line in rags. The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see the saddened faces of the Canadians.
C: KYLE
D: Do you see them? Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
C: THE MOLE
D: No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.

N: The boys think.
S: EXT. USO SHOW - DAY
N: Helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show in Apocalypse Now. Groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the landing platform and touches down. The US army men cheer. The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Ladies and gentlemen of the American war effort, we salute you!
N: A big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more Pattonlike.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Tomorrow you will be risking your lives so that our children will have a better future... God bless you men. And God bless this filth free nation. Many of you will die. Die like blood bathed pigs. So tonight, we at MAC present a NIGHT OF A HUNDRED STARS! Now without further ado, I give you...

C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Pint size pixie and darling of the indie movie scene, Winona Ryder!

C: WINONA RYDER
D: Hi guys! I'm T.V.'s Winona Ryder!
N: One guy claps.
C: WINONA RYDER
D: I want you all to know I'm super psyched to be here today. You guys rock. What you're doing for our country so sooo cool. It's so real. I've been acting since I was twelve and I can't distinguish between make believe and real life.
N: Winona falls down. But gets back up immediately.
C: WINONA RYDER
D: And then I confuse me real life with my big-screen one. And sure, people get hurt, and I'm sorry about that but Christ, look at me. It's not my fault that I can get any guy I want. And that's reality to me. But you guys... wow. I mean, war, man. Fucking war. It doesn't get any more real-- Now, this one goes out to you.
N: She cues the band which has been assembled from the same helicopter. Jazz music starts up. It's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused.
C: WINONA RYDER
D: You know what I'm gonna do for you now, don't you?

C: THE MOLE
D: Sheet!
N: Mole ducks, just avoiding the light. Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole. The whole camp is in front of them. There is a HUGE barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from) A dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with Howitzers. It doesn't look good.
C: THE MOLE
D: Move! Move!
N: One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the ground, and run for a nearby building. Once at the building, they all duck to avoid the search lights.
C: THE MOLE
D: Okay.... The Americans must be holding Terrance and Phillip in one of those bunkers. We will split up here. Let's synchronize watches!

C: STAN
D: MARCO!!!
N: No answer. Stan stumbles a bit.
C: STAN
D: Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy...
N: Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and his head smacks against a rock. Stan is out cold. Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his flashlight around.
C: STAN
D: What is that?
N: The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on something that is huge and throbbing.
C: STAN
D: OH MY GOD!!!
S: EXT. STAGE - NIGHT
N: Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip.
C: KYLE'S MOM
D: Gentlemen, do you have any last words?
C: PHILLIP
D: Last words? Let's see... How aboot "GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS CHAIR". How's that for last words?
N: Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: WAIT!!
N: General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: We have just captured some Canadian Sympathizers!
N: The crowd cheers. Kyle's mother smiles.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: We will execute them along with Terrance and Phillip for your viewing pleasure!
N: Another cheer. The mothers are all very pleased. That is, until they see Kyle and Cartman brought out to the stage at gunpoint.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Kyle?!
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Eric?
C: KYLE
D: Hi, ma.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: We also have a Canadian SPY who was hiding out in South Park!!
N: Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Ike?!
N: Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: General... These are OUR CHILDREN!
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: They are Canadian sympathizers and they must be dealt with accordingly!
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: But they're CHILDREN!
N: Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped into their chairs.
C: CARTMAN
D: Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I get your autographs?!
C: TERRANCE
D: Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're killed.
C: KENNY'S MOTHER
D: We can't kill these kids!
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Listen mothers, YOU'RE the ones that started all this. Don't get all emotional NOW!
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: But we're doing all this to help our children's futures!
C: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
D: Yes, I think shooting our children would adversely affect their futures.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: No... The General is right.
C: KYLE
D: MOM!!!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO
C: BE RUINED BY SMUT!!

C: KYLE
D: YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
S: EXT. IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT
N: Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a HUGE, pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the X-Files. It's the size of a small building. The massive thing starts to glow. Stan looks weak and afraid.
C: BIG THING
D: Be not afraid...
N: Stan trembles.
C: STAN
D: What...
E: Weakly
C: BIG THING
D: Behold my glory.
C: STAN
D: What... are you?
C: BIG THING
D: I am the clitoris.
N: Stan's eyes grow wide. MUSIC starts to swell up.
C: STAN
D: The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
C: BIG THING
D: Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
C: STAN
D: Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
C: BIG THING
D: There are more important matters right now...
C: STAN
D: NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
C: BIG THING
D: Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
C: STAN
D: Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
C: BIG THING
D: Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
N: The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La Resistance come running into frame. Wendy and Gregory are with them as well.
C: WENDY
D: Stan! Stan are you okay?!
C: STAN
D: Wendy?
C: GREGORY
D: I see you failed in your mission. Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now.
N: Wendy bends down to pick up Stan.
C: WENDY
D: Come on Stan, we have to hurry. The Canadian forces are about to attack!!
N: Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around her.
S: EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT
N: A drummer plays as the execution begins.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!! Throw the switch!!!
N: The executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look horrified.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Goodbye, bastards!
N: Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily.
C: TERRANCE
D: Take that, bitch.
N: As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out:
C: PHILLIP/TERRANCE
D: FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!!
N: Suddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead bodies in all directions. Canadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale attack!! From a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs in every direction.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: THE CANADIANS ARE ATTACKING!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
N: FWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion! Everybody just starts screaming and shooting in every direction. Total and complete mayhem. One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and Phillip stop drying. The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.
C: KYLE
D: CARTMAN!
C: CARTMAN
D: WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
E: Frying
C: PHILLIP
D: What's going on Terrance?
C: TERRANCE
D: Canada is saving us!!
N: Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.
S: INT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM
N: Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.
C: SATAN
D: Have you finished?
E: Whispering
N: Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last drops underneath the bed.
C: KENNY
D: Mph mph.
C: SATAN
D: Then move out of the way.
N: Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of matches.
C: SATAN
D: I must be strong... I must be strong...
N: Satan tries to light the match. It won't light.
C: SATAN
D: Damn it...
N: Finally, the match lights. Satan holds it up-
C: SATAN
D: Goodbye, Saddam...
N: -and throws it onto the bed.
C: SATAN
D: Come on!
N: Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out.
S: EXT. USO SHOW - DAY
N: People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all around.
C: JIMBO
D: Ned! Behind you!
N: Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through Ned's neck. Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses.
C: JIMBO
D: NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!
N: FWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst the explosions.
C: CARTMAN HOLY SHIT!
D: AGHAGHGAH!!
E: Zap
N: Now when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the blue current swirl around his body.
C: CARTMAN
D: HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!
N: General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie talkie as his men die all around him.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: ALRIGHT MEN!!! FALL INTO FORMATION! "HUMAN SHIELD" UP FRONT THEN "OPERATION GET BEHIND THE DARKIES"!!!
N: They all fall in. A phalanx of black men, Chef included in them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD! PROTECT OUR TANKS AND PLANES, TOO!
N: Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep. Behind them is a line of missile launchers. General Plymkin's jaw drops.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: Holy Mother of Johosephat...
N: The black guys all look at each other nervously.
S: EXT. BATTLEFIELD
N: The boys run through the chaos. Body parts and scrapnel fly here and there. A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the boys holding a massive head wound.
C: KYLE
D: Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!!
N: Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get him out of here...
N: Garrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman. Just then, Garrison goes limp. Cartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys run from the battle. They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are standing in a human shield around the white guys.
C: CHEF
D: Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU... ONE!!
N: The Canadian tanks take aim.
C: CHEF
D: TWO!
N: The Canadian tanks fire.
C: CHEF
D: THREE!!
N: All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the whites completely exposed.
C: GENERAL PLYMKIN
D: What the-
N: The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo.
C: BLACK SOLDIER
D: GREAT PLAN, CHEF!
C: CHEF
D: Operation Human Shield my ASS!
S: EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY
N: From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be heard in the distance. We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer. He shoots like a maniac into the Canadians. He wounds one and then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.
C: MR. MACKEY
D: Die Canadian, mmkay?!
N: And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest. But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.
C: MR. MACKEY
D: Mkay-
N: Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around gunfire.
C: BIG GAY AL
D: Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going FAST!!!
N: Another bullet zings by his head.
C: BIG GAY AL
D: Jumping Jesus, this is insane!!
N: THUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More bullets follow, tearing him to shreds. WIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters, gunfire and death. Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: My God... This is terrible...
N: Kyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely insane.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: This is what we wanted! We wanted our children to be brought up in a smut-free environment!!!
C: KENNY'S MOTHER
D: But we didn't want THIS. I just followed you 'cause I made a shitload of money selling Kenny t-shirts!
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: Oh Lord, what have we done...?
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Wake up, people! We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
N: The other mothers look very confused.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect plan!! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!!!!!
N: The other mothers walk away.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
N: Kyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and explosions.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Killed. They should only be so lucky. Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!
N: She charges the field.
S: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS
N: Terrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud explosions.
C: PHILLIP
D: Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
C: TERRANCE
D: You did? Just now?
N: They laugh merrily.
C: PHILLIP
D: Come on, we can take shelter in one of those buildings!
N: But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER AAAGHGAHGHGH!!! YOU DESTROYED MY
D: FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!
N: Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen.
C: TERRANCE
D: AGH!
C: PHILLIP
D: Terrance! NO!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: DIE!!!!!!
N: SLOW MOTION SHOT - Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach. Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down, down... Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!! CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes. CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground... BACK TO REAL TIME Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames and ash take over the sky. Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle.
C: SATAN
D: RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!
N: Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on both sides can't believe what they're seeing. Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off and looks around.
S: EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT
N: As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike huddle close to each other in a trench.
C: CARTMAN
D: Kyle... All those times I said you were a big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew.
N: Kyle thinks.
C: KYLE
D: Yes I am!
C: IKE
D: Baba mama!
N: Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the boys' heads.
C: CARTMAN AGH!
D: What the hell am I still holding this for?!
E: Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand
N: Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: Mr. Hat! Noooooo!
N: Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench.
C: KYLE
D: Stan!
C: STAN
D: Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
C: KYLE
D: Sweet.
C: CARTMAN
D: Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's well that ends well, huh? We can go home now. There's just one little thing left to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!!
E: Sarcastic
N: More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys. Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys.
C: CARTMAN/KYLE
D: AGAGAH!!!
C: CARTMAN
D: It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to take us to the netherworld!
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rmph rmph?!
C: KYLE
D: Wait! He's not haunting us, he's trying to tell us something!
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
C: CARTMAN
D: Okay! We can get you some proofs of purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny! Just mellow the heck out!
S: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT
N: More battle. People are dying left and right. The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows the Canadian's head clean off.
C: DOCTOR GAUCHE
D: Hey, pal, don't lose your head.
N: Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead, and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled shotgun.
C: CANADIAN SOLDIER
D: I'm glad you got that off your chest.
N: Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian through the head with his bayonet.
C: TOM
D: I guess he got the point.
N: A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes. CANADIAN SOLDIER 2 Plastics are a cheap and efficient insulator for electrical applications. Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush in.
C: SATAN
D: Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!
N: The soldiers all look scared and puzzled.
C: SATAN
D: You're all part of Satan's army now!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: What the hell is going on?!
N: Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face.
C: SATAN
D: I am the dark master!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
C: SATAN
D: SILENCE! I AM SATAN!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Oh.
C: SATAN
D: YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!! AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
N: Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed.
C: CHEF
D: Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a lot.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: I... I was just trying to make the world a better place for children...
C: SATAN
D: Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: And I thought my mother was the master of guilt. Geez Louise.
C: SATAN
D: SILENCE!!! NOW!!! EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Oh God... What have I done...
N: One by one, the soldiers start to kneel. Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible, deep laugh that fills the world. But just then, the ground shakes again. Satan looks over to the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another figure. He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini glass in his hand.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Hey, I'm missing the party!
C: SATAN
D: No! It can't be!
N: Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his ass.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Did you miss me, buttercup? All right, gang! I am your new ruler now! Everyone bow down to ME!!
E: Yelling out
N: Satan puts his head down.
C: KYLE
D: HOLD EVERYTHING!!!
N: Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.
C: KYLE
D: You made a deal with Kenny that if he got ten proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores you'd grant him any wish.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: And?
N: Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays.
C: SATAN
D: I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
C: KYLE
D: What?
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: The deal's off, go away, guy.
C: SATAN
D: No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Relax bitch! You're better seen, not hear okay?
N: Saddam smacks Satan in the face. Now Satan looks mad, but he sits down like a good little bitch.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Now, let's start torturing people, shall we? We'll start with... THIS little fat kid first!!
E: Looks at Cartman
C: CARTMAN
D: AY! Don't call me fat, buttfucker-
N: ZAP!! A huge CHARGE shoots from Cartman, knocking one of hell's demons on his ass.
C: STAN
D: Holy shit Cartman! What was that?!
C: CARTMAN
D: How the fuck should I know!!
N: ZAP!!! Another huge CHARGE emits from the v-chip inside Cartman and sends the other Swedish Soldier reeling.
C: KYLE
D: Look at that!
C: CHEF
D: It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric! The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
C: TERRANCE
D: Oh boy!
N: A smile comes across Cartman's face.
C: CARTMAN
D: BUTTFUCKING SHIT!
N: BZZZZZZZZT! A huge charge busts the chains that hold Cartman's wrists. He jumps down.
C: CARTMAN
D: Yes!
N: TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays as Cartman uses his newly found power.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Quick, Satan! Do something!
N: But before Satan can do anything, Cartman holds up his hands and lets loose.
C: CARTMAN
D: FUCK A HUNK A SHIT, YOU RAT FUCK!!!
N: BZZZZZZZZZAAT!!!! A charge hits Satan square between the eyes and knocks him down. He gets to his knees and stands up again.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat!
C: CARTMAN
D: Try this on for size-
N: Cartman holds up his hands.
C: CARTMAN
D: DRIPPING VAGINA EATING SON OF A PIGFUCKING CRACK WHORE!!! HAIRY COCK SLURPING MAGGOT FUUUUUCK!!!!
N: BZZZAAAAT!! The charge hits Saddam in the chest. He drops again. Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared. He appeals to Cartman.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Hey buddy! No need to stress! Let me make you a deal! How about a lifetime supply of Snacky Smores and we just forget about this whole thing?!
C: KYLE
D: Don't listen to him, Cartman!
C: KENNY
D: Mrphmmmph!!!
C: CARTMAN
D: Okay. Not.
E: giving in then
N: Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the worst words in the world. Then, it comes out. Like a volcano.
C: CARTMAN
D: SUCK THE HOT SHIT FROM MY GURGLING ASS YOU BLOOD DRENCHED FROZEN TAMPON ON A STIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
N: BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZATTTTTTTTT!!!!! A huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam. Saddam is thrown back against the wall.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: What are you waiting for, bitch?! Destroy him!!
E: To Satan
N: Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks...
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket! Save me!!
N: Satan stands there.
C: SATAN
D: Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?! You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
C: SATAN
D: If you love somebody then you treat them with respect! You've never respected me!
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Can we talk about this later? Everyone is watching!
C: SATAN
D: I don't care! I want to talk about it now!
N: Saddam grabs Satan by the arm.
C: SATAN
D: Ow, you're hurting me!
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends! You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
N: Satan starts getting really mad. Steam starts coming from his nostrils.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Your little problems can wait til later, see?
N: Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
C: SATAN
D: THAT'S IT! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
N: Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming cliff, back into the depths of hell.
C: SADDAM HUSSEIN
D: NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!! Heeeeyyyy guyyyyy, relaaaaaxx.....
C: CHEF
D: Saddam Hussein is dead!
C: STAN AND KYLE
D: Hooray!!!
N: Everyone cheers.
C: PHILLIP
D: You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
C: TERRANCE
D: Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
C: CARTMAN
D: Well, I learned it all from you guys.
C: PHILLIP
D: Of course you did, cock fuck!
N: They all laugh merrily. Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam fell.
C: SATAN
D: He spent so much time convincing me I was weak and stupid that I believed it myself.
N: The boys look at each other, confused.
C: SATAN
D: Saddam didn't respect me. All he wanted was sex. But it took me so long to figure that out.
N: He starts to cry. Chef hands him a hanky.
C: CHEF
D: Here you go Satan-
C: SATAN
D: Thank you. Give me the proofs of purchases.
N: Kenny hands them to Satan.
C: SATAN
D: Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any wish you want is yours.
N: TRACK IN slowly on Kenny. MUSIC BUILDS. Finally, Kenny speaks.
C: KENNY
D: Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.
N: Everyone GASPS!!
C: KYLE
D: WHAT?
C: STAN
D: Are you sure, Kenny?
C: SATAN
D: What did he say?
C: STAN
D: He said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back.
C: CHEF
D: Kenny, you realize this wish is the only chance for YOU not to be dead...
C: KENNY
D: M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm. Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.
N: Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand, important speech.
C: SATAN
D: Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
C: KENNY
D: Mph rm.
N: Satan turns to the open abyss.
C: SATAN
D: I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's too fucking cold up here.
C: STAN
D: Aren't there cold parts of hell?
C: SATAN
D: Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm destined to live in hell... alone...
N: Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But something catches his eye.
C: SATAN
D: Hello... What's this?
N: Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and then places it gently on his hand.
C: SATAN
D: Hi there, little guy... Would you like to go to hell with me?
C: SATAN
D: Sure. I bet we can be best friends!
E: AS MR. HAT
N: Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat. The boys walks over to Kenny.
C: KYLE
D: Thank you, Kenny.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
N: A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them. At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at themselves, wondering what just happened. Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.
C: MR. GARRISON
D: I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?
C: BIG GAY AL
D: Wow... We were all killed and now we're fine. That's super!
C: KYLE
D: Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
C: CARTMAN
D: Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a bitches!
N: The boys' parents walk up.
C: STAN
D: Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
C: KYLE
D: Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
C: KYLE'S MOTHER
D: Shiteater-
C: STAN'S MOTHER
D: -Or monkey fucker-
N: They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness. Wendy walks up to Stan.
C: WENDY
D: I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get it after all!
N: Stan smiles. MUSIC swells.
C: STAN
D: Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
C: WENDY
D: Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
C: STAN
D: My friend the clitoris told me.
C: WENDY
D: Wow, I have a clitoris too.
C: STAN
D: Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
N: Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits into Wendy's mouth.
C: STAN
D: But Wendy... What about Gregory?
N: Gregory stands off to one side, scowling.
C: WENDY
D: Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
C: STAN
D: You didn't?
C: WENDY
D: No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

C: STAN AND WENDY
D: I can't stop now... My heart's awake! I pray your arms my arms to take! So this is why I'm alive!

C: UNCLEFUCKA!
D: YOU'RE AN UNCLEFUCKA, YES IT'S

N: Kenny's mom and dad come up.
C: KENNY'S DAD
D: This is all so wonderful. I just wish our little Kenny could see all of this joy.
C: KYLE
D: Oh he can, dude. Look!
N: Kyle points to the sky. Everyone looks up just in time to see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky. We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it. As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting towards the heavens. As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and up through the clouds. (NOTE: This will also be done in 3-D CGI) Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness. Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings. They smile gently. He feels calm. He feels good. Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally... into Heaven. END.
