S: EXT. TITLE SEQUENCE P 1

C: CAPTION
D: The most powerful ruler in Christendom, Philip of Spain, has sworn to return all Europe to the Catholic faith.
N: Images of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court paintings: stiff, formal, imperious.

S: INT. PRIVATE CHAPEL, ESCORIAL PALACE, SPAIN - DAY 2
N: Bn ascetic-looking man dressed in black kneels in a small plain chapel, in virtual darkness. PHILIP II, King of Spain bows his head low, abasing himself before his God. S/I CAPTION: scorial Palace, Spain, 1585. Now, slowly, he raises his head. His eyes open, and we see there the glow of a new certainty. God has spoken to him.
C: PHILIP
D: 
E: I hear. I obey. My Lord and my God.
N: May 1 Blue Draft--p.2
S: INT. HALLWAY/SALON, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY
N: Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered; among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he enters, all kneel. His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling, heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all.
C: PHILIP
D: 
E: God has made his will known to me. The time for our great enterprise has come.
N: The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself.
C: RESTON
D: At last.
N: Cathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard through the open windows. The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony.
S: EXT. BALCONY, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY
N: Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him. Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's power. Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his people's adoration.
S: EXT. THAMES - DAY
N: A ripple of light on the water. A blur of approaching colour. May 1 Blue Draft--p.3 The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape: its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting bright shards of shining water in the sunlight. eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling, cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out. Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the Queen. They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE. Over this an insistent voice:
C: HOWARD
D: Why do you go among the people, majesty? I tell you plainly, you will be murdered! Every Catholic in England is a potential assassin!
E: V.O.
S: INT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: An agitated group is gathered in this room where the business of state is transacted. We catch glimpses of the Queen in their midst, preparing to leave, as her ministers try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation: SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, 30s, an ambitious courtier; LORD HOWARD, 50s, a weathered old campaigner; and standing back from the rest, watching from the side lines, SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM, the Queen's veteran friend and adviser.
C: HATTON
D: Be warned by the atrocities in France! God-fearing Christians murdered by Papist cut-throats inflamed by hatred of the truth!
C: HOWARD
D: We know the Catholics take their orders from Spain. The Spanish speak openly of Mary Stuart as
N: Queen of England in waiting.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out by her own ungrateful nation.
E: sharply
C: HATTON
D: With respect, majesty - a
N: Catholic Queen. Your loyal Protestant supporters don't understand why Mary Stuart lives under our protection, at our expense - very considerable expense -
C: ELIZABETH
D: Mary Stuart is my cousin. She is our guest. And she is under our control.
C: HOWARD
D: But while she lives, majesty, she is a beacon that draws our enemies' eyes and hopes.
C: ELIZABETH
D: While she lives?
C: HATTON
D: She is the poison at the heart of England. The poison must be cut out.
N: 4A
C: ELIZABETH
D: You'd have me make a martyr of her. What is her crime?
S: EXT. THAMES - DAY
N: The Londoners on the river bank cheer and wave as the royal barge goes by.
C: HOWARD
D: Treachery, ma'am. All Catholics are traitors! Their loyalty is to the Pope of Rome.
E: V.O.
C: ELIZABETH
D: How many Catholics are there in England, sir?
E: V.O.
C: HOWARD
D: Immense numbers, majesty!
E: V.O.
C: HATTON
D: We believe half the nation clings to the old superstitions.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
C: ELIZABETH
D: What would you have me do? `Cut out' half the people of England?
C: HOWARD
D: We must act, majesty. Our inaction is taken to be weakness.
C: ELIZABETH
D: If any of my people break the
N: law, they will be punished. Until that day, I wish them to be let them alone.
C: HATTON
D: Until the day they rise in rebellion! Majesty, we have proven reason to fear every Catholic in the land -
C: ELIZABETH
D: Fear creates fear, sir. I will not punish my people for their beliefs. Only for their deeds. am assured that the people of England love their Queen. My constant endeavour is to earn that love.
S: EXT. ROYAL BARGE, THAMES - DAY
N: Londoners on the river banks wave and cheer. Elizabeth, seated on the royal barge, sees them with satisfaction. She gives an occasional slight inclination of her head in acknowledgement. Elizabeth sits with her favourite seated beside her, her youngest and prettiest maid of honour, BESS THROCKMORTON. Walsingham sits facing them, looking sourly at the cheering spectators.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Why does everyone torment me with
N: Mary Stuart? Pink Revision May 18- p.6 ELIZABETH(cont'd) It's not her fault that she's next in line to the throne. (to Bess) Don't hide your face. She leans over to brush a stray lock of hair from Bess's face.

C: WALSINGHAM
D: Produce an heir and there'll be no more talk of Mary Stuart.

E: V.O.
N: ow we see the royal carriage riding through mature forest, accompanied by a mounted entourage. IN THE CARRIAGE - The king, Philip II, the Infanta and Father Robert Reston.

C: PHILIP
D: Every tree that falls hurts me. I lose a part of myself. I am cursed with sensitivity. I feel too much.

C: RESTON
D: Your majesty has a merciful soul.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p.11
C: PHILIP
D: I sacrifice my country's forests to save the souls of a lost nation. That is true mercy. England is lost to darkness, Father. I bring light.
N: WIDE NOW - We see the carriage and the royal party crest a hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest has been felled as far as the eye can see. Great piles of cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. Everywhere men are at work lopping branches from felled trees. Wagon teams haul immense trunks away. Fires burn stacks of lopped branches, and the smoke rises up into the empty sky. N THE CARRIAGE - On Reston's face as he stares at the fires. He speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his own fanatical certainty.
C: RESTON

S: INT. MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY
N: The terrier scampers ahead of Annette to its mistress, MARY STUART, who sits embroidering a pink satin petticoat. She is a handsome but bitter woman in her mid-thirties. Round her stands her small retinue of three ladies and a chaplain.
C: MARY
D: This is so pretty I'm inclined to send it as a present to my dear cousin Elizabeth. She holds up the delicate work to show her ladies.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p.12
C: MARY
D: It is an intimate garment, of course. But even Elizabeth must have the occasional intimate moment. Annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her, holding out the letter.
E: CONT'D

D: My Queen.
N: Mary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her and reads it for herself.
C: MARY

D: That's enough, Annette. Slit her throat? Please.
E: But she loves it.
C: ANNETTE
D: And when the bastard usurper is dead, my lady will be queen.
N: The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning. The Warden of Chartley Hall, SIR AMYAS PAULET, enters the room. He is soberly dressed, but has charming manners, and is clearly susceptible to his handsome ward. Mary turns to him at once with a teasing smile.
C: MARY
D: Here's my noble jailer, come to smack my hand. She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds the letter out of sight.
C: MARY
D: Have I sinned again, sir?
C: PAULET

C: MARY
D: See how I pass my time in my lonely prison.
C: PAULET
D: Charming, ma'am. Distractingly charming. She holds the intimate garment against her body. Paulet seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being
N: duped. MARY Such a pretty undergarment. But for whose eyes? DoubleGoldenrod - 25 July -p.14
S: INT. ARMOURER'S SHOP, LONDON - DAY
N: A pistol is being loaded: a fiddly process involving a powder horn, wadding, and an iron ball the size of a hazelnut.
C: ARMOURER
D: So what's it for, my young friend? Not for shooting rabbits, I'm guessing.
E: O.O.V.
C: SAVAGE

E: very low
N: Tell our master one of the circle has already gained access to the court. The Armourer nods. He hands the pistol to Savage. Savage takes it and leaves. Immediately after, a man enters and walks up behind the now seated Armourer. The Armourer turns round.
C: RESTON
D: I ask for your forgiveness. Moving with speed, he seizes the Armourer's head, twists it to one side, and snaps his neck. Reston walks quietly out of the store.
S: EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: A crowd of eager SPECTATORS and WOULD-BE COURTIERS has gathered, held back by a line of guards, all hoping to attract the attention of the Queen when she appears. This is the route from the Presence Chamber to the Chapel Royal. May 1 Blue Draft - p.15 Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to see her. Two of Walsingham's men, AGENTS 1 and 2, mingle in the crowd: faces we'll see again. Tom Babington stands unobtrusively at the back of the crowd. He carries a bag which may or may not contain a gun. bustle of activity, a ripple of anticipation - `She's coming!' - and the palace doors open. BABINGTON'S POV: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS, the cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst, Elizabeth, almost completely masked as she passes by. Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham. The people cheer, call out to the Queen, reach to touch her, fall to their knees.
C: CROWD
D: God bless your majesty - God love you! - See her sweet face!
N: Others in the crowd are shouting more militant sentiments. CROWD Hang the Papists! - Look out for traitors, Elizabeth! Mary Stuart is the whore of Rome! Babington moves forward, easing his way to the front of the crowd. Nearby there stands another young man who is watching, not cheering: RAMSAY. A WOMAN WTH A BABY pushes her way almost to the Queen, holding her baby before her. WOMAN WITH BABY Your blessing, majesty. My little one, your blessing. BABINGTON'S POV- The Queen stopping to bless the little baby, smiling, putting out her hand to touch the baby's head. The mother bobs a curtsey. The Queen moves on, with her entourage. A sudden scuffle in the crowd. Babington turns to look. A CLOAK SWEEPS THROUGH FRAME - dropping down to the ground - revealing as it passes the handsome smiling face of Raleigh, directly in R the path of the Queen.
C: ALEIGH
D: A puddle in the way, majesty.
N: Elizabeth signs to the guards to stay calm. She stares at Raleigh, then she looks down at the cloak. No sign of any puddles. Bess Throckmorton watches, suppressing a smile. May 1 Blue Draft - p.16 Elizabeth looks back up, meets Raleigh's eyes with a cool appraising gaze. Then she walks on over the cloak, shaking her head.
C: ELIZABETH
D: A puddle... The guards take up their positions once more. Bess throws Raleigh a quick smile as she follows the royal party. His answering shrug says: I tried. He picks up the cloak, and stands gazing after the Queen.

D: We still need to keep France out of the arms of Spain.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Let me think on it. What if enemy ships should sail up the Thames? Can the docks be closed?

N: She turns her attention back to Hatton and the portraits. Raleigh bows and withdraws, followed by his men. Walsingham follows.
S: INT. HALLWAY, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: Raleigh comes out into the hallway with Calley by his side.
C: RALEIGH
D: What did you think of her?
C: CALLEY
D: Terrifying.
C: RALEIGH
D: But magnificent. He moves on.
N: Raleigh's eyes fall on Don Guerau, the Spanish Ambassador, passing near with his fellow Spaniards and a few English courtiers and ministers, including Hatton. Don Guerau stares at him. The doors to the privy chamber open and the Queen's ladies come swishing out in a tight chattering group, Bess beside her friend MARGARET. May 1 Blue Draft - p.24
C: MARGARET
D: `Mud and leaves'! I nearly died!
C: ESS
D: `Patata! You eat it!'
N: They giggle as they go by.
C: MARGARET
D: She liked him. I could tell.
C: BESS
D: Well, wouldn't you?
N: They see Raleigh now, and the chatter ceases. The ladies come to a stop and curtsey. Raleigh gives a bow, his eyes singling out Bess.
C: RALEIGH
D: I'm glad to have the opportunity to thank you. Without your help, I'd still be in outer darkness.
C: BESS
D: I did very little, sir. You'd already caught the Queen's eye.
C: RALEIGH
D: Then I thank you for the very little.
N: The ladies go on their way and the laughing chatter resumes, with many a backward glance at the handsome Raleigh. No one pays attention to a figure in the shadows, another of Walsingham's men, AGENT 3.
S: EXT. WOOD - DUSK
N: Young Savage stands alone among trees, shivering, white- faced, half-mumbling, half-singing an endless prayer. He holds a pistol with which he means to kill himself. But he can't do it. S
C: AVAGE
D: Salve regina, mater misericordiae, vita dulcedo et spes nostra salve...
E: singing
N: In a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. They are young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and FRANCIS THROCKMORTON. A fourth man stands before them, his back to us, watching Savage. At first we don't see who he is. May 1 Blue Draft - p.25
C: RESTON
D: His weakness endangers us all. He can't go on with us. And we can't leave him behind.
E: O.O.V.
N: Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a priest.
C: RESTON
D: Who will help him?
N: Babington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a little behind.
C: SAVAGE
D: singing) Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii Evae. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle -
N: He sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from his hand.
C: BABINGTON
D: Make your peace with God.
N: Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means to do. Terror overwhelms him.
C: SAVAGE
D: No, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't want to die!
N: Now he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this, and can't shoot. Reston begins to pray aloud.
C: RESTON
D: Si ambulam in medio umbrae mortis, non timebo mala -
N: The others join in with the words of the well-known psalm. Babington too joins in, now weeping.
C: RESTON AND OTHERS
D: Quoniam tu mecum es, Domine. Virga tua et baculus tuus, ipsa me consolata sunt - ANG! Savage falls dead.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p.26
S: INT. WALSINGHAM'S HOUSE - EVENING
N: Walsingham enters his private home, and gives his hat and cloak to his servant.
C: SERVANT
D: Visitor waiting, sir.
N: Walsingham frowns. He climbs the stairs to the door of his study. There, pacing nervously, is his younger brother WILLIAM, a middle-aged student. Walsingham's scowl disappears. He opens his arms wide. WALSINGHAM William! WILLIAM Hello, Francis. They embrace. Then Walsingham pushes him back to take a good look at him.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: You look terrible. Don't they feed you in Paris? How are your studies? Learned the secrets of the universe yet?
C: WILLIAM
D: Not yet.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: These are dangerous times to be questioning the ways of God. You must take care of yourself.
C: WILLIAM
D: My needs are simple.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: You'll dine with us? You'll lodge with us?
N: is daughter MARY appears at the top of the next flight.
C: MARY WALSINGHAM
D: William!
N: She comes tumbling down and into his arms. She's an eager innocent 20-year-old, much loved by her father.
C: WILLIAM
D: Look at you! All grown up.
N: URSULA, Walsingham's wife, appears as Mary leads William up the stairs. May 1 Blue Draft - p.27
C: URSULA
D: William. This is a pleasure.
C: WILLIAM
D: I've been away too long, ma'am.
C: MARY WALSINGHAM
D: You come with me, William.
N: ary and William go on into the family's living rooms. Ursula meets her husband's eyes.
C: RSULA
D: He's not still a student, is he?
S: INT. LIVING ROOM, WALSINGHAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: William is by the fire, listening to Mary playing the virginal and singing. Walsingham and Ursula are by the dinner table.
C: URSULA
D: Have you spoken to the Queen?
C: WALSINGHAM
D: I speak to her daily.
C: URSULA
D: You know what I mean. You've done enough. No man could do more.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: I can't leave court yet. The Queen needs me.
C: URSULA
D: So you're to die in harness like a pack horse, are you? And for what? Mary! William!
E: calling
C: WALSINGHAM
D: These are difficult times-
C: URSULA
D: It's always difficult times. Mary joins them, her arm in William's. Walsingham seizes the opportunity to change the subject.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: William, come and tell us all the new ideas in the University. Will the great breach in the church ever be healed?
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p.28
C: WILLIAM
D: I doubt it, brother. Compromise is out of fashion. On both sides they say there can only be one truth, and one God.
C: URSULA
D: Sit, sit.
C: MARY
D: ere by me, William.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: What do they say in Paris of the Pope's call for holy war?
C: WILLIAM
D: Many welcome it.
C: URSULA
D: I don't understand why we must all hate each other.
C: WILLIAM
D: Truth will always hate falsehood, ma'am.
C: MARY
D: Why do we have to talk about war? Tell us your nice news, William. Are you married yet?
C: WILLIAM
D: Not yet.
E: smiling
C: MARY
D: Then we must find you a nice sensible English wife.
C: WILLIAM
D: No, no. I won't be staying long. I must go back to my studies.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Not too soon, I hope. Every man deserves a rest.
C: URSULA
D: Listen to him! When did you last rest, I'd like to know? He won't listen to me. Not a thought for his health. You tell him, he's your brother. He'll die at his desk, out of sheer selfishness.
E: to William
N: Green Revision May 25 - p.29 Walsingham shares a rueful smile with William that says, `Women, eh?'. They take their seats for dinner.
S: INT. GREAT HALL, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: 7 27 Elizabeth sits sumptuously gowned and jewelled at an ornately-dressed dining table, surrounded by her ladies, Bess among them; Walsingham discreetly in the background. They're listening to a young Austrian make a formal speech of love. The AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR stands to one side, mouthing the words to prompt him. The ARCHDUKE CHARLES is still a boy: sixteen years old, slight, pale, trembling with shyness. He struggles through his rehearsed speech. ARCHDUKE CHARLES Your majesty's beauty is dazzling to my eyes. Your learning is famed throughout Europe. I see before me perfection in human form. Oh, Elizabeth! How blessed am I to stand in your fabled presence, warmed by your greatness as by the rays of the sun. Oh Elizabeth! To speak your name is to hear celestial music. May that sweet sound guide me through my life to come - Elizabeth! Elizabeth! I have travelled here, to this illustrious court, in the hope that our two great nations might be joined in love. But now that I am bathed in the radiance of your glory, I am overwhelmed. I am conquered. I die. Only your love, great Elizabeth, can restore me to life. ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts. The Spaniards sneer openly. But Elizabeth takes the charade with due gravity.
C: LIZABETH
D: Your highness does me great honour. Shall we eat our dinner? It should prove almost as restorative as my love.
N: Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing pranks on the guests. Green Revision May 25 - p.29A Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He catches Bess's eye and they share a smile.
C: COURT LADY
D: So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship? You shoot holes in its sides, I suppose.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p.30
C: RALEIGH
D: No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no value. The object is to capture and command.
C: COURT LADY
D: And how do you do that?
C: RALEIGH
D: Surprise. Speed. Irresistible violence.
N: Calley, listening, rolls his eyes. Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side, glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has hardly touched his food.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I think you're not as accustomed as I am to eating in public. I have a secret. lowering her voice) I pretend there's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them. he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also Raleigh.
C: ELIZABETH
D: They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. You should try it.
N: She beckons to Bess.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Bess.
N: Bess comes forward.
C: ELIZABETH
D: He interests me. Talk to him.
E: low
C: BESS
D: Him, my lady?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Him.
N: Bess turns and looks across towards Raleigh, as he flirts with the court ladies. Green Revision May 25 - p.31 Elizabeth turns back to her guest.
C: ELIZABETH
D: His highness is tired after his journey.
N: The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply.
C: ARCHDUKE CHARLES
D: No man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a Queen. lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German.
C: ELIZABETH
D: (You play the game very well, my young friend. But don't you
N: sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really thinking?) The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile.
C: ARCHDUKE CHARLES
D: 
E: I daren't even think what I'm really thinking.
C: ELIZABETH
D: (You're thinking, perhaps, that
N: you would far rather be home.)
C: ARCHDUKE CHARLES
E: You're very wise, madame.
N: He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it. Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies.
C: COURT LADY
D: I adore the natives you brought back with you. I don't suppose you could get one for me? They're not dangerous, are they?
C: RALEIGH
D: That depends what you propose to do with them.
C: COURT LADY
D: I'd dress him up in mulberry- coloured silk and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak.
N: Green Revision May 25 - p.31A Bess has now approached Raleigh.
C: BESS
D: The pirate is not too bored by the vanities of the court, I hope.
C: RALEIGH
D: A simple sailor, dazzled by the bright lights.
N: Bess draws him away from the court ladies.
C: BESS
D: If you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle of the bright lights for a moment -
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p.32
C: RALEIGH
D: rawn away by the brightest light of all.
C: BESS
D: That can only mean the Queen.
C: RALEIGH
D: I don't presume to raise my eyes so high.
N: They both look at the Queen. She's watching Raleigh. He bows.
C: BESS
D: It seems you've presumed after all.
C: RALEIGH
D: It seems you're determined to think the worst of me.
C: BESS
D: Tell me what it is you really want.
C: RALEIGH
D: What every man wants. Money. Fame. Love.
C: BESS
D: In that order?
C: RALEIGH
D: Each leads to the next. The money will buy and equip ships for a return voyage to the New World. The success of my infant colony there will make me famous. The fame will bring me love.
C: BESS
D: It seems rather a long way round.
C: RALEIGH
D: There are benefits along the way. It is something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city.
C: BESS
D: Which you will no doubt name after yourself.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p.33
C: RALEIGH
D: No doubt. B
E: smiling
C: ESS
D: Well, then. I am answered.
C: RALEIGH
D: May I ask a question in return?
C: BESS
D: Of course.
C: RALEIGH
D: How am I to win the Queen's favour?
C: BESS
D: Why should I tell you that, sir?
C: RALEIGH
D: I've little enough to offer, I know. But whatever I have to give - ask, and it's yours.
N: Bess thinks for a moment.
C: BESS
D: My advice to you is, say what you mean to say as plainly as possible. All men flatter the Queen in the hope of advancement. Pay her the compliment of truth.
N: She gives him her hand. He kisses it.
C: RALEIGH
D: I don't even know your name.
C: BESS
D: Elizabeth Throckmorton.
C: RALEIGH
D: A second Elizabeth.
C: BESS
D: Everyone calls me Bess. he goes back to the Queen, as Elizabeth is rising to leave. She speaks to the company.
C: ELIZABETH
D: His highness the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him. He will retire to his private quarters to rest.
N: This causes much amusement. Don Guerau sneers openly. The Archduke rises. All rise. The Archduke bows solemnly to the Queen, and leaves with his entourage. Elizabeth beckons to Walsingham, and speaks low to him.
C: ELIZABETH
D: He's a sweet boy. I don't want him hurt by your schemes.
S: INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
N: Bess is reading to Elizabeth. Elizabeth watching her, her mind elsewhere.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I suspect him of being a professional charmer. Am I right?
C: BESS
D: He is certainly charming, my lady.
C: ELIZABETH
D: There are duller professions. And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms?
C: BESS
D: He hopes for glory in his New World. He dreams of building a shining city.
N: ELIZABETH Which I'm to pay for, no doubt. (Beat) You like him, don't you?
C: BESS
D: It's refreshing to meet a man who looks to a world beyond the court.
C: ELIZABETH
D: So it is. We shall let him come again.
S: INT. MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY
N: Mary Stuart holds her pet dog in her arms, listening to Annette, who kneels before her. May 1 Blue Draft - p. 35
C: MARY
D: Dismissed? On whose orders?
N: She looks up at the laundress, who stands red-eyed and snuffling, with a guard by her side.
C: MARY
D: Do stop snivelling.
C: ANNETTE
D: The Warden, my lady.
C: MARY
D: The Warden? My Warden?
N: As she speaks, Sir Amyas Paulet enters. Mary's voice becomes seductive.
C: MARY
D: What have you done now, you bad man? Sent away my laundress? How am I to have clean clothes? Or do
N: you want me to go about naked? Paulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked.
C: PAULET
D: That was not my motive, ma'am.
N: Much though - (Thinking better of it) Your laundress was found to be carrying letters in her washing. Not her job, I think.
C: MARY
D: How am I to send my intimate letters?
C: PAULET
D: Through me.
C: MARY
D: And you will read them.
C: PAULET
D: With respectful admiration.
C: MARY
D: Am I to have no privacy?
C: PAULET
D: No. Beneath the charm, steel.
C: MARY
D: You disappoint me, sir.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p. 36
C: PAULET
D: The Queen orders these measures for your protection.
C: MARY
D: The Queen! Am I not a Queen too? What if I wish to write a love letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a copy? Is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine?
C: PAULET
D: The Queen grieved when your husband died, ma'am. As she grieved when your second husband
N: died. And the third. If there is a possibility of a fourth -
C: MARY
D: Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's order too? That you torment and mock me? She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter, haughty, not deigning to look back.
C: MARY
D: They say she's a beautiful woman.
N: Is she so very beautiful? PAULET I don't presume to comment on the Queen's person.
C: MARY
D: She's called the virgin queen. Why is that, sir? Can it be that
N: no man will have her? Mary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep the Warden under her spell. She waves Annette and the laundress away.
C: MARY
D: My friend, forgive me. You are my friend, are you not?
C: PAULET
D: I am your servant, ma'am, and your admirer.
C: MARY
D: I shall send no more letters. I shall stay here quietly, in my prison. With you.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p. 37
S: INT. ANTECHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: The same crowd of petitioners wait in vain for access to the Queen. The same door keeper. Raleigh enters, and this time the door keeper bows, and ushers him through the open doors. Over this we hear Raleigh's voice telling of his adventures: RALEIGH (V.O.) It begins with a journey. You must cross an ocean.
S: INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
N: Elizabeth listens attentively, her eyes looking far away into the distance, as Raleigh tells of his adventures. RALEIGH Can you imagine - can you feel - what it is to cross an ocean? For weeks you see nothing but the horizon. All round you. Perfect, and empty. Your ship is small - tiny - a speck in such immensity.
S: INT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: Walsingham is talking to Elizabeth about matters of state. We are on her face, and we can see that she hears nothing of what he tells her. Her mind is all on Raleigh's voice.
C: RALEIGH
D: You live with fear, in the grip of fear - fear of storms, fear of sickness on board, fear of the immensity. What if you never escape? How can you escape? There's nowhere to go. So you must drive your fear down, deep into your belly, and study your charts, and watch your compass, and pray for a fair wind - and hope.
E: V.O.
S: INT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT
C: 33A 33A
D: Now Elizabeth is with Raleigh again, listening as he goes on speaking to her, now directly.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p. 38
C: RALEIGH
D: Pure naked fragile hope, when all your senses scream at you, Lost! Lost! Imagine it. Day after day, staring west, the rising sun on your back, the setting sun in your eyes, hoping, hoping - Sir Christopher Hatton enters.
C: HATTON
D: Majesty, the Archduke and the court are waiting.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Let them wait! Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were hoping.
E: sharply to Raleigh
N: Hatton bows and leaves, frowning.
C: RALEIGH
D: At first it's no more than a haze on the horizon, the ghost of a haze, the pure line corrupted. But clouds do that, and storms. So you watch, you watch.
N: 4 34
S: INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS, WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT
N: Elizabeth dances with Raleigh. As they dance, his voice continues over; and Elizabeth seems to be listening to him.
C: RALEIGH
D: Then it's a smudge, a shadow on the far water. For a day, for another day, the stain slowly spreads along the horizon, and takes form - until on the third day you let yourself believe. You dare to whisper the word - land!
E: V.O.
N: The music ends, and the dance finishes. Elizabeth is seated now - it's later in time. Raleigh is speaking intently to her, and she is captivated.
C: RALEIGH
D: Land. Life. Resurrection. The true adventure. Coming out of the vast unknown, out of the immensity, into safe harbour at last. That - that - is the New World.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p. 39 A short silence. Elizabeth is absorbing what he has told her.
C: ELIZABETH
D: The Queen does not have a private life.
E: V.O.
S: INT PRESENCE CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: Elizabeth is on the throne. The Archduke Charles and his entourage face her. The court fills the room. Elizabeth makes her formal response to the young Archduke.
C: ELIZABETH
D: The Queen lives for her people. You will therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer I decline your offer of marriage.
N: The Archduke, barely able to conceal his relief, turns to the Austrian ambassador.
C: ARCHDUKE CHARLES
E: Can I go home now?
N: Elizabeth inclines her head, trying not to smile.
C: ELIZABETH
D: 
E: Go home, my friend. Don't be in a hurry to grow old. Youth is so very precious.
N: Elizabeth rises and takes the Archduke's arm as they start to leave the chamber. Bess, in her wake, finds an opportunity to speak softly to Raleigh.
C: BESS
D: Well? Are you satisfied with the Queen's favour?
C: RALEIGH
D: She listened as if she understood me.
C: ESS
D: Then I shall expect some gratitude. R
C: ALEIGH
D: What do you want?
N: Their eyes meet, both aware of the current of mutual attraction. May 1 Blue Draft - p. 40
C: BESS
D: I expect I'll think of something.
N: Bess hurries after the Queen. The Austrian entourage is just leaving as the Queen turns.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Mr. Raleigh.
S: INT QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
C: 35A 35A
D: Elizabeth and Raleigh walk together around the perimeter hallway, dwarfed by vast murals.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I like your immensities. Your ocean is an image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us?
C: RALEIGH
D: You speak like a true explorer.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I like you, Mr Raleigh.
C: RALEIGH
D: And I like you.
N: She stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes. She's not used to such direct replies. Bess is watching them.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him.
C: ALEIGH
D: I have heard that.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And what have you to say about it? R
C: ALEIGH
D: Reward my mission, majesty, not me.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Is the mission not the man?
C: RALEIGH
D: Leave me free to like you in return. That can be my reward.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Go on.
C: RALEIGH
D: I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself.
N: Elizabeth stares. This is a little too close to the truth.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Now you become dull.
C: 35B 35B
D: EXT. WINDSOR GREAT PARK - DAY
N: Horses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying - Two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride, neck and neck- Elizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other, faces glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the moment. Raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length. At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk.
C: RALEIGH
D: Mine!
N: Elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You have - the stronger horse.
E: out of breath
C: Y RALEIGH
D: ours carries the lighter load.
C: ELIZABETH
D: The Queen does not give way to others. Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse springs forward, ahead of her.
C: RALEIGH
D: Whoa! Whoa! Forgive me, majesty. My horse doesn't know his place yet Elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued.
E: at Elizabeth, reigning in the horse
N: 43A
C: ELIZABETH
D: Have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh? She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm surprised you're not married yet.
E: CONT'D
C: RALEIGH
D: I'm a sailor, majesty.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And can sailors not be lovers?
C: RALEIGH
E: with a smile
N: Must lovers be husbands?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Ah, I see. You like love better
N: than marriage. That I understand. RALEIGH Your majesty is not eager to be married?
C: ELIZABETH
D: When I marry, I marry for my country.
N: (looking at Raleigh) When I love, I love for myself. (pause) You have had many loves, I think.
C: RALEIGH
D: Some...
E: with a smile
C: ELIZABETH
D: You've yet to meet your equal? Raleigh hesitates. She understands him.
C: RALEIGH
D: I would want someone who knows me as I am. Now it is Elizabeth who hesitates. He understands her as well.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You want a friend, not just an equal. You want someone to share your joy when you're happy.
N: Double Blue - july 8 - p.43B ELIZABETH(cont'd) Someone to cry with when you're sad. Someone to talk to when there's nothing to say. Someone to find by your side when you wake in the night. Someone who remembers what you once were, when you've grown old. She turns to him with a smile.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Ah yes. I know all about it. There. I'm rested now. She turns her horse around in the direction from which they came. Raleigh follows.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: We can be something to each
E: CONT'D
N: other, I hope, Mr. Raleigh. She spurs her horse, and suddenly she's racing away, back across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers and Queen's ladies, including Bess. Raleigh spurs his horse to follow, also fast, but this time careful to keep a distance behind. As they near the courtiers, Raleigh splits off. Bess watches as Elizabeth turns and looks after him as he rides away. 6 36
S: INT. BESS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Bess creeps out of her bedroom, pulling on a cloak.
S: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT
N: Bess makes her way down the dark palace corridor, stepping over sleeping courtiers as she goes. Margaret watches her from the shadows.
S: EXT. LONDON ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Cloaked and hooded, Bess passes quietly down an alley, stepping over more sleeping forms. London's homeless. She finds a door, checks a note she holds, glances round to be sure no one sees her, knocks and enters.
S: INT LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A man closes the door behind his visitor. Bess shakes off her hood. It's George Throckmorton, one of the conspirators. They embrace. Double Blue - july 8 - p.43C
C: BESS
D: George! What's wrong? Is your father alright?
C: THROCKMORTON
D: He's old. He won't live long now. Thank you for coming, dear Bess.
C: BESS
D: I was worried. You must send me no more letters. You know what would happen if I was caught.
C: THROCKMORTON
D: I need your help.
C: BESS
D: Do you need more money?
C: THROCKMORTON
D: My father is a tired old man. We don't want to hide like this
N: anymore. We both want to get back to court.
C: BESS
D: You are known Papists.
C: THROCKMORTON
D: The Queen loves you. Speak to her.
C: BESS
D: I cannot betray the Queen.
C: THROCKMORTON

C: THROCKMORTON
D: If they catch us, they will kill us. Our lives are in your hands.

S: INT. HALLWAY, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: A group of the Queen's ladies make their way down the hallway, Bess among them. The others are gossiping in low whispers as they go. Bess is silent with anxiety. Then she looks ahead, and her face fills with fear. Walsingham is coming down the hallway towards them. The ladies curtsey. He nods, and throws a glance at Bess. The ladies move on. Bess looks back. Walsingham is also looking back, and seems to be watching her.

D: So why don't you?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Alright, then. I will.
N: He blinks: caught by surprise.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Would you like to go to sea, Bess?
C: BESS
D: Majesty?
C: RALEIGH
D: I'm afraid that's not possible. Women bring bad luck on board ship.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, do they?
C: RALEIGH
D: Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room, for months at a time - Men have needs. A beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Men have needs?
E: amused
N: nce again Elizabeth meets Raleigh's eyes. Then she breaks away, feeling the contact is dangerous.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Then let them stay on land and see to their needs. Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony, Bess. We must persuade him to stay a little longer, mustn't we?
E: to Bess

C: 42A 42A
D: Raleigh is leaving. Walsingham has been waiting for him. He falls into step beside him.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Mr Raleigh. A word of advice. The Queen chooses to show you favour. You naturally wish to take advantage of that. Don't ask for too much.
E: Beat
C: RALEIGH
D: You think all I want is money.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: I hope all you want is money.
N: Buff Revision 6th June - p.44A
C: RALEIGH
D: You think I'm a cynical adventurer, with little breeding and less education. You're wrong. I'm a cynical adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: I begin to see why the Queen likes you.
S: INT/EXT. LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A soft knock on the door. Francis Throckmorton goes to the window and looks out. THROCKMORTON'S POV - In the street outside, a woman with her head covered. He unbolts the door. T
C: HROCKMORTON
D: Bess?
N: Two men burst in and seize him. They are Agents 4 and 5. Beyond, the woman - not Bess - is hurrying away. Throckmorton struggles. A single sharp blow, and he folds to the ground. REPOSITIONED AS SCENE 35B 44A-B 44A-B
S: INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
N: Multiple images of Elizabeth, naked. Strange misty refracted glimpses of her face, her body. A bath of steaming hot water has been placed in the Queen's private quarters, and screened by mirrors. The Queen is in the bath, being washed by her ladies. ess Throckmorton has the job of holding the Queen's hair out of the water as she's washed. She strokes the soft tresses as she holds them, unaware that Elizabeth can see her in the mirror. Then she looks up and catches Elizabeth's eyes, and stops in confusion.
C: ELIZABETH
D: No, don't stop. I like it.
N: Bess returns to her gentle caresses, and Elizabeth to her thoughts.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Is it true, Bess? That I've never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself?
C: BESS
D: I hope you believe that I like you for yourself, my lady.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Is anybody ever liked just for themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you're pretty. And because you have the ear of the Queen.
N: May 1 Blue Draft - p. 50
C: BESS
D: No doubt, my lady.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Him too. He likes you because he wants my favour. You do realise that?
C: BESS
D: Yes, my lady.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And the other thing too, of course. But all men want that. Male desire confers no B distinction.
N: ess strokes Elizabeth's hair in silence. Then she sees Elizabeth gazing at her in the mirror.
C: LIZABETH
D: I envy you, Bess. You're free to have - what I can't have. You're my adventurer. Don't be afraid. It's all over so soon.
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY
N: A man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick lunch. He's the TORTURER. Nearby on a blood-stained bench lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably. It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary. Walsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet. Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Still nothing to tell me, Mr Throckmorton?
N: Throckmorton struggles to lift his head.
C: HROCKMORTON
D: My soul will go free soon.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: I know about the Enterprise. I need names. But if you won't help me, perhaps your father will.
N: He signs to the torturer. The torturer goes into an adjoining cell. orchid revisions 28 June - p. 51
C: WALSINGHAM
D: He's been questioned, as you have. I do have to know, you see.
N: The torturer and a guard enter, dragging between them the broken but living body of OLD THROCKMORTON.
C: THROCKMORTON
D: No!
N: Old Throckmorton looks up, eyes blank with suffering.
C: THROCKMORTON
D: Enough! You want a name, I'll give you a name.
C: WALSINGHAM

C: ELIZABETH
D: Mr Raleigh. I've kept you waiting.
C: RALEIGH

N: than me.
C: ELIZABETH
D: There is always other business. But I have been waiting too. Walsingham enters.
C: WALSINGHAM

C: ELIZABETH
D: Yes, Walsingham?
C: WALSINGHAM
D: The traitor has talked, majesty. The traitor Throckmorton.
N: orchid revisions 28 June - p. 52A A flash of fear in Bess's eyes.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Forgive me, sir. As you see, my time is not my own.

S: EXT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY
N: The torturer, now off duty, is standing in the open doorway to empty his bladder. He's unlacing his britches, when he hears footsteps approaching behind.
C: ORTURER
D: Harry?
N: The torturer begins to piss, with evident pleasure.
C: TORTURER
D: You'll never guess what I heard -
N: A knife at his throat. A quick slash. The killer, Agent 3, waits one more moment, to be sure the job is done. The torturer slumps, still standing, against the wall. Agent 3 slips away. On the flag stones, blood trickles down to mingle with the urine.
S: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
N: Now there are guards everywhere. The whole palace is on heightened alert. lizabeth sweeps out of the Privy Chamber into the Great Hall, accompanied by the Spanish Ambassador on one side and Walsingham on the other. Her entourage scuttles behind.

D: What do you know of the Enterprise of England, Ambassador?
C: DON GUERAU
D: The Enterprise...? Forgive me, your majesty...
C: ELIZABETH
D: It's a plan for the invasion of my country. Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and -
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Norfolk.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And Norfolk. Mary Stuart is to be set free, and placed on the English throne.
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 54 ELIZABETH(cont'd) I am to be assassinated. Does any of this sound familiar?
C: DON GUERAU
D: I know nothing of any invasion plans.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England. It should more accurately be called `la Empresa di Inglaterra', because it's a Spanish plan. The plan of your king, my one-time brother-in- law, Philip II, to attack my country.
N: The Ambassador decides the best form of defence is attack.
C: ON GUERAU
D: Attack? It is my country that is under attack! Your so-called pirates attack our merchant ships daily! Do you think we don't know where their orders come from? The whole world knows that pirates sail up the Thames all the way to the royal bed!
C: ELIZABETH
D: You will leave my presence, sir! Go back to Spain! Tell Philip that I don't fear him, or his priests, or his armies. Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets.
E: exploding
N: Don Guerau sees no point in further pretence. He speaks with pride and contempt.
C: DON GUERAU
D: You see a leaf fall, and you think you know which way the wind blows. But a wind is coming, madam, that will sweep away your pride. e bows and turns to go. Elizabeth's words blaze after him.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I too can command the wind, sir. I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare, if you dare to try me!
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 55 Shivering with rage she turns round, and there's Raleigh. Her fury overflows onto him.
C: ELIZABETH
D: What are you staring at? Lower your eyes! I am the Queen!
N: She sweeps past him without a further glance. ON RALEIGH - Watching Elizabeth go. A shake of his head. Enough.
S: EXT. SHIPYARD, SPAIN - DAY
N: Immense stacks of cut timber as far as the eye can see. Skeletons of new ships, big ships, rising in the great yard. Hundreds of ship-builders at work. his is what the forests were felled for: a brand-new fleet is being built. Tiny figures in the wide scene: the royal party appears. Philip has come to see progress for himself. As he and his entourage tour the construction site, one of his ministers briefs him on the latest developments in England.
C: SPANISH MINISTER
D: 
E: It can't be denied that we've lost the advantage of surprise. A large part of our plans has come into their hands.
C: PHILIP
E: The Jesuit is still at liberty?
C: SPANISH MINISTER
E: We understand so, majesty.
C: PHILIP
D: 
E: He knows his business. We've lost nothing.
N: The workmen kneel to Philip as he passes.
C: PHILIP
D: 
E: Tell the carpenters to go on working. No one is to stop for me. The fleet must be ready to sail in a month.
C: SPANISH MINISTER
E: Impossible, majesty!
C: PHILIP
D: 
E: If this is God's work, God will make it possible.

D: Tell the Queen that I will
N: trouble her no more. As soon as my ship's repairs are complete I will ask permission to sail.
C: BESS
D: The Queen asks me to assure you -
C: RALEIGH
D: I need no assurances. I'm no courtier and never have been. I've lost my appetite for playing games that it seems I'm too stupid to understand.
C: BESS
D: That is unfair -
C: RALEIGH
D: You call me unfair!
C: BESS
D: Let me speak!
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 57 Raleigh is taken aback by Bess's sudden anger.
C: BESS
D: The Queen shouts at you once, and you sulk like a child. I thought you more of a man than that. And I thought you a better friend to the Queen. Her every move is watched by a hundred eyes. Assassins plot to kill her. Enemies prepare to overwhelm her country. And you say she's playing games? Raleigh is watching her as she speaks, and he's impressed.
N: Anger suits her. RALEIGH Very well. What is my Queen's command? BESS Go to her, sir. As her friend.
S: INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
N: Elizabeth is pacing, disturbed, Raleigh's letter open in her hand. The doors open. Raleigh enters. Elizabeth waits for the servants to close the doors behind him. Holds up the letter.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You ask permission to go.
C: RALEIGH
D: Yes, majesty.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You plan to return to the New World. To your colony. For two, or three, or four years.
C: RALEIGH
D: If your majesty grants me your royal warrant.
C: ELIZABETH
D: That is a long time.
C: RALEIGH
D: There's nothing left for me to do here. At sea I know what I'm to do, I know the risks, I know the rewards. Here -
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 58 A shrug. What can he do?
C: ELIZABETH
D: But you're quite wrong. You are needed here. I have decided to appoint you Captain of my personal guard.
C: RALEIGH
D: Captain of your - !
C: ELIZABETH
D: Kneel.
N: He kneels. She taps him on the shoulder with one hand.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Rise, Sir Walter Raleigh.
N: He rises, but keeps his eyes on the ground. ELIZABETH Well? You may express your gratitude.
C: RALEIGH
D: This is too great an honour.
C: ELIZABETH
D: If it's such an honour, why are you staring at your boots?
C: RALEIGH
D: You know why. He raises his eyes, but he still doesn't look at her.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Now you stare at the wall. Am I so old and hideous that you can't even look me in the face?
N: He turns now, and looks her in the face.
C: RALEIGH
D: Why do you talk like a fool when you're anything but a fool?
N: This stops her in her tracks. For a moment she can't trust herself to speak. Then:
C: ELIZABETH
D: My friend, forgive me. I'm a vain and foolish woman. At court it's all a game. I like to be admired. I require it. I grow accustomed to it. But it's all - nothing.
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 59 ELIZABETH(cont'd) You come here as if from another world, and I - You have real adventures, you go where the maps end. I would follow you there if I could, believe me. Raleigh looks long into her eyes. If anything, he admires and loves her all the more now.
C: ELIZABETH
D: The storm clouds are gathering, my friend. Please don't leave me now.
S: EXT. GALLOWS - DAY
N: CLOSE ON Throckmorton as the noose is tightened round his neck. His face is ravaged by the tortures he's endured, but he holds his head high, ready for death. Round him an unseen crowd bays for blood.

N: Reston puts his hands on Babington's shoulders and gently but irresistibly forces him down to pray with them.
C: RESTON
D: Lord, be with us as the end approaches.
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 60 RESTON(cont'd) We will not fail in our duty. We look beyond death, to eternity.

S: INT. PRIVATE CHAPEL - NIGHT
C: 55B 55B
D: Bess is on her knees before the simple altar, her head
N: bowed in prayer. Raleigh enters through the rear doors. He stands in silence, watching her as she prays. He hears her sigh. He takes a step towards her. She hears, startled. Turns and sees him.
C: BESS
D: Oh! It's you!
C: RALEIGH
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.
C: BESS
D: My prayer's done.
N: She rises to her feet.
C: RALEIGH
D: Something has distressed you.
C: BESS
D: And I thought I prayed in silence.
C: RALEIGH
D: So you did.
N: She turns away, unable to look him in the eyes.
C: BESS
D: A man was hanged today. A Papist. I knew him well. He was my cousin. He died because I gave information. I gave information to prove my loyalty. Because I was afraid.
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 61
C: RALEIGH
D: That's necessity. That's the world we live in.
C: BESS
D: He told me he wanted to change. Become part of the new England. I was afraid that he was lying to me. But what if - what if it was true? He sees the horror in her eyes, at the thought that she has sent an innocent man to his death. Tears rise to her eyes. BESS
N: What if I was his last hope? What if I was the one person he thought he could trust?
C: RALEIGH
D: If you knew him well, you will have sensed the truth.
C: BESS
D: I thought so.
C: RALEIGH
D: He was hoping to use you. You did
N: what you had to do. She can no longer hold back the tears.
C: RALEIGH
D: There, now. He wipes away a tear from her cheek. In desperate need of comfort, she throws herself into his arms. He holds her
N: close as she sobs.
C: RALEIGH
D: We're all mortal, Bess. We do what we can. He strokes her cheek. She meets his eyes, filled with gratitude. She takes the hand that touches her face and moves it to her lips. She kisses it, still holding his eyes. He draws her back into his arms, and they kiss. Suddenly they're kissing eagerly, greedily, their long pent- up passion released at last.

S: EXT. CHARTLEY HALL - DAY
N: A brewer's wagon, pulled by two dray horses and carrying beer barrels, crosses the ancient bridge over the moat and pulls up by the gates. The brewer, a big ugly man called BURTON, looks down at the GUARDS. Beside him, taking care not to draw attention to himself, sits Ramsay.
C: BURTON
D: Morning. Another filthy day on God's stinking earth.
C: GUARD
D: Morning to you.
N: It's a familiar ritual. The guards search the wagon.
S: INT. CELLAR, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY
N: Burton, standing outside, rolls the barrels through a trap door and down a chute into the cellar, where they are caught by the CELLARMAN, and stacked. Another GUARD stands and watches. B
C: URTON
D: Last cask!
N: The cellarman takes it, then closes the trap door. The guard watches as the cellarman empties the beer barrels into open vats; leaving the bungs on one side. The barrels are then thrown on a fire.

S: EXT. RIVER/DEE'S HOUSE - DUSK
N: The moon seen through a sextant. A strange figure stands on the flat roof of a riverside house, studying the night sky. He's tall, with a long pointed beard and a skullcap: the famous magus DR JOHN DEE. A hiss and splash from the night river. He turns to look. Out of the mists and shadows comes the lights of an approaching barge. ON THE ROYAL BARGE - Elizabeth and Walsingham, wrapped against night chill, being rowed up river. Over this, lines led from the next scene:
C: ELIZABETH
D: ell, Dr Dee. Here I am again, back to consult the wisdom of your charts.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DEE'S HOUSE - DUSK
N: The finest library in England. The greatest array of scientific instruments. Part study, part laboratory, part magician's lair, Dr Dee's house is crammed with the evidence of his wide-ranging curiosity. May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 64 The magus sits at a table before an astrological chart, while Elizabeth and Walsingham look on.
C: DEE
D: The alignment of the planets is most unusual this year. Mars is due to take the ascendant three days after the anniversary of your birth - your majesty was born on September 7th - and I see that twelve days before the anniversary of your birth - He transfers his attention to a different, astronomical chart.
C: DEE
D: - there will be a full moon - the moon which -
N: He moves back to the astrological chart.
C: DEE
D: - governs the fortunes of all princes of the female gender.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Princes of the female gender.
C: DEE
D: I mean to say, a prince who is also a woman.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yes, Dr Dee. I am following you. So what does it all mean?
C: EE
D: It means the rise of a great empire, majesty. And it means convulsions, also. The fall of an empire.
N: Elizabeth listens, a faraway look in her eyes. She knows nothing of the planets, but she feels it deep within herself: her moment of destiny is near.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Which empire is to rise, and which is to fall?
C: DEE
D: That I can't say. Astrology is, as yet, more an art than a science.
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 65 Walsingham has been idly examining the scientific instruments. He speaks now as if his question is casual.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Nothing more, Dr Dee? No more specific calamities that we can guard against?
C: ELIZABETH
D: He means, Will I be assassinated?
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Queens are mortal.
N: Dr Dee smiles as he gently contradicts him.
C: DEE
D: Elizabeth is mortal. The Queen will never die.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You see, Francis? This is a mystery. He has no patience with mysteries. W
E: to Dee
C: ALSINGHAM
D: What I don't know, I can't use.
C: DEE
D: And yet mysteries have power. Have you not learned that?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Francis. Leave us for a moment.
N: Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth turns to Dr Dee. Now for a short private moment the Queen becomes a woman.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And the private life of this prince of the female gender, Dr Dee? What do the stars foretell there? Or is this too a mystery?
C: DEE
D: These are matters of state, majesty.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Do the stars not foretell matters of state?
C: DEE
D: For such a prediction, I must look in a different chart.
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 66 He means her face. He murmurs to himself as he studies her features, reading her character.
C: DEE
D: Wonderful... Out of such suffering, to have forged such strength... You will need all your strength in days to come... And love... So much love...
N: But as he looks, he finds something more that disturbs him.
C: DEE
D: But you doubt yourself, my child... I've not seen fear in
N: your face before. ELIZABETH Have I reason to fear?
C: DEE
D: Something has weakened you...
N: There is danger, yes... Your strength lies in your spirit. Nothing else matters. There are hard days coming. You must trust the power of your spirit. Elizabeth is shaken by these words. Dee turns to look out once more at the night sky.
C: DEE
D: But I'm no prophet. I see no more than the shadows of ghosts.
C: ELIZABETH
D: An art, not a science. I understand.
S: EXT. THAMES - DUSK

N: Burton hands him the letter. Reston opens it and reads it at speed. Then he hands it to a man we don't see.
C: RESTON
D: What do you think? There must be
N: clear and valid authority. He gazes at the unseen man, waiting on his verdict.
C: WILLIAM
D: No. It won't do. Reston nods agreement. He returns to the table and dashes off a letter, muttering as he does so.
E: O.O.V.
C: RESTON
D: We wait on a direct order. He completes the note and gives it to Burton.
C: RESTON
D: One more journey, my friend. Then consummatum est! It is finished.

D: Please! I'm innocent! I've always been a loyal servant of the Queen. I'd never betray the Queen, never -
C: WALSINGHAM
D: But you have, my dear. And you do. We both know that.
N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 68 Bess knows he means her affair with Raleigh. Now she's too terrified to speak. Walsingham rises.

E: to Bess
C: ELIZABETH
D: Let him throw you round, Bess. You can trust him.
N: The dancing master spins Bess round and lifts her up into the air. Her feet fly out as she spins. It's a bold, even risqué dance, and the onlookers laugh to see it.
C: DANCING MASTER
D: And round - and round - and round - and down!
N: He lowers Bess to the ground. She loves it. As the spinning begins again, Raleigh enters.

C: RALEIGH
D: Nonsense.
C: ELIZABETH
D: What?
C: RALEIGH
D: You don't mean a word of it. You eat and drink control.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Do you say so?
N: The exercise ends. All clap.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Bess, you must try a dance with Mr Raleigh. He's eager to show us his skill.
C: RALEIGH
D: No skill at all, majesty. I don't know the steps.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, it's very simple.
N: he goes to Bess to demonstrate, holding her by the waist.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You stand like this, with your hands firmly clasped here - and when she jumps, on the eighth step, you swing her round - once, twice, three times - and you're back to the beginning. What could be simpler?
C: DANCING MASTER
D: Your majesty knows the dance better than I.
C: ELIZABETH
D: So come, Mr Raleigh. Take your position. I am to be obeyed.
C: RALEIGH
D: As your majesty wishes.

N: The dance begins again. Bess jumps, and Raleigh swings her round and round, finding the knack after an awkward start. Elizabeth watches, smiling, nodding to the beat. She can see the faces of the dancers; and so long as she controls the intimacy between them, she's excited by it. Walsingham enters and stands by her side, watching.

D: Leave her alone, Walsingham. I want both of them left alone.

N: May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 71 RESTON(cont'd) (with quiet steely satisfaction) I think we have it. He hands the letter over. For the first time we see who it is: William, now revealed as one of the conspirators. William reads the letter for himself.

C: WALSINGHAM
D: I was eleven years old. And you, this helpless bundle. I looked at you in your crib, with your little wrinkled face, and I loved you from the first. I vowed then to look after you. I watched you grow up with your head in the clouds, always a dreamer. I couldn't follow you there. And now I've failed you, haven't I? Forgive me if I haven't loved you enough.
N: Clink. Something falls from William's hand to the floor. His face has gone grey.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Did you really think I didn't know?
N: On the floor - a dagger. William opens his mouth to answer, but no sound comes out. Walsingham raps twice on his desk. The door opens, and Agents 4 and 5 enter.
C: WALSINGHAM

Babington lets out a cry of anguish, and crumples to the ground. Elizabeth stares on into space, frozen by the moment, magnificent.
S: INT. MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY
N: Mary paces impatiently in her room, trailed by her little dog. She hears the sound of bells. Joy floods her features. Pounding feet. She turns to see Sir Amyas Paulet hurrying towards her, through a gate in the wall.

N: He has led up to this deliberately, and now stands smiling at her utter confusion. The man who looked like a fool has been playing his own game all along.
C: MARY
D: Me? What has any of this to do with me?
N: Paulet makes a sign. Burton the brewer comes through the gate: Walsingham's man after all.
C: AULET
D: That's the trouble with intrigue, isn't it? With so many secrets, you can never quite tell who's on who's side, until the game ends.
N: He takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it.
C: PAULET
D: My own invention. Theatrical, but effective. My master has every letter you've written.
C: MARY
D: Your master?

C: WALSINGHAM
D: Ready to die, I see, Jesuit.
C: RESTON
D: I have done what I was sent to do.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Why was the gun not loaded?
N: Reston doesn't answer. Walsingham gazes at him a moment longer. Then he moves the lamp along. There, shackled and white-faced, sit Babington and Ramsay. Walsingham studies their faces. Walsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it into the next cell. Here lies a man in chains, huddled on the floor. He looks up as the light falls on him. William. Walsingham looks down on the pitiful sight.
C: ALSINGHAM
D: What was the Jesuit sent to do?
C: WILLIAM
D: To kill the Queen. You know it. You know everything.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Not quite everything.
C: WILLIAM
D: I've told you all I know. Go ahead and kill me. Take what's left of me. I don't care any more. All my life you've had everything and I've had nothing. So finish it. There's a better world waiting for me. We'll all be judged in the end, brother. Even you.
N: Walsingham gazes down on this pitiful show of pride. orchid revision 28 June -p. 76
C: WALSINGHAM
D: You're no martyr. You weren't even much of a murderer. Go back to France. Back to your dreams. Never let me hear of you again.
N: Walsingham turns away. As he goes we see what he won't show William: that the hurt of the betrayal is almost more than he can bear. He goes back up the passage. As he passes Reston, the Jesuit calls out softly.
C: RESTON
D: Send me home.

C: MARY
D: Who are you to sit in judgement on me? By what authority do you condemn a Queen? God alone has made me what I am. He is my only judge. Raise your law above God's law, and what law remains?

I die as I have lived - trusting in the mercy of my God - a Queen.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Yes, I am afraid. I am always afraid.

N: May 1 Blue Draft -p.91
C: WALSINGHAM
D: How did you know about the numbers of the Dutch barges, majesty? I don't recall supplying you with that information.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You may observe, Walsingham, that I don't see my way with only one eye. Nor do I hop along on only one leg. Why then would I rely on only one source of information?
N: She sweeps into her quarters. Her ladies, waiting there, jump up in haste. She scans them.

S: EXT. THE LIZARD, CORNWALL - DUSK
N: We are on the very tip of England. A watch-tower has been built, and next to it a large beacon of wood. A YOUNG MAN is minding the watch. He stares out to sea, catching sight of something. Over the rim of the world has appeared the long line of the Spanish fleet, like a floating wall, black and menacing. e runs down the steps from the tower. He lights a bundle of sticks and thrusts them again and again into the beacon. The beacon catches fire. As the flames rise into the sky, so a second beacon erupts into flame on the next headland. And then a third on the next, a fourth on the next, a fifth, disappearing around the coastline.
S: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - DUSK

D: Here, my lady!
C: ELIZABETH

C: BESS
D: Yes, my lady. Elizabeth falls on her with uncontrolled rage, striking out at her, beating her about the head, shrieking out the words
N: that so inflame and wound her. Bess takes the blows in silence.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You traitress! You dare to have secrets from me! I am your Queen! You ask my permission before you rut - before you marry - before you breed! My bitches wear my collars! Do you hear me? How dare you be with child!
N: Walsingham comes hobbling up.
C: WALSINGHAM
D: Majesty, please! Dignity - mercy -
N: But Elizabeth is too far gone. She turns on him, eyes blazing.
C: ELIZABETH
D: This is no time for mercy! That's what you said to me. I don't forget. But you showed mercy, Walsingham! Go to your traitor brother, and leave me to my business! alsingham turns white. Elizabeth is back berating Bess.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Is it his child? Tell me! Say it! Is the child his? Tell me! Say it! Is it his?
N: Bess responds to the Queen's hysteria with dignity.
C: BESS
D: Yes, my lady. It is - my husband's child.
N: Her gaze reaches beyond the Queen. Elizabeth turns. May 1 Blue Draft -p.93 Raleigh has come up to them unnoticed. He has seen and heard all. He speaks to Elizabeth quietly, sadly.
C: RALEIGH
D: This is not the Queen I love and serve.
N: Elizabeth stares at him. He meets her eyes. His gaze is so unflinching that slowly the madness drains out of her. When she speaks next, she is her proud self again.
C: ELIZABETH
D: This gentleman has seduced a lady under my care. This lady has married without my consent. These are offences punishable by law. Arrest him.
E: to Walsingham

C: DEE
D: You want me to tell your majesty only what your majesty chooses to hear?
N: May 1 Blue Draft -p.94
C: ELIZABETH
D: I will not be a toy of the fates! Have I not faced an assassin's bullet and lived?
N: She turns to Dr Dee and sees his quizzical gaze on her, and she lets her rage pass.
C: LIZABETH
D: Just tell me there's no certainty. The shadows of ghosts, you said. Any outcome is possible. Give me hope.
C: DEE
D: The forces that shape the world are greater than all of us, majesty. How can I promise you that they'll conspire in your favour, even though you are the Queen? But this much I know. When the storm breaks, each man acts in accordance with his own nature. Some are dumb with terror. Some flee. Some hide. And some spread their wings like eagles and soar on the wind.
N: Elizabeth understands. She draws herself up, finding now the self-belief she needs for the battle to come.
C: ELIZABETH

C: ELIZABETH
D: Release Raleigh. He is forgiven... As I too pray to be forgiven...
N: Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth goes forward to stand before the altar alone.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Leave me. All of you.
N: The remainder of her entourage bow and withdraw. Elizabeth goes on down the nave to the altar, and there, at the foot of the steps, sinks to her knees. She does not bow her head.

S: EXT. ENGLISH CAMP, TILBURY - DAY
N: A low distant beat as we TRACK THROUGH the English camp. The soldiers are a citizen army, no hardened professionals. We pass a troop busy sharpening their pikes; an older soldier in quiet prayer; a band sharing drinks; a youth rubbing down a horse. Now they hear the distant beat approaching. One by one they look up, surprised, uncertain. Now they hear it loud and clear: the beat of an army on the march. CLOSE ON tramping feet. An advancing force. Horses' hooves beating the ground.

D: I am called the Virgin Queen. And
E: V.O.
