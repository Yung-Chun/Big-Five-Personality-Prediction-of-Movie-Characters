S: EXT. SPACE - X
N: As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States. The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.
C: NARRATOR
D: It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago. And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes. To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever.
E: V.O.
S: EXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
C: NARRATOR
D: It began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston.
E: V.O.
N: We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street.
C: NARRATOR
D: It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits. That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids.
E: V.O.
N: Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled, and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball- throwing kids points at the sled kid. KID #1 Hey, Greenbaum!
C: GREENBAUM
D: Uh oh.
N: KID #1 It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know what I'm gonna get him?
C: GREENBAUM
D: W...what?
N: KID #1 My fist in your fuckin' face!
C: GREENBAUM
D: Why would Jesus want that?
N: KID #2 Get him! The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking) approaches the melee.
C: NARRATOR
D: But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits. Little John Bennett. That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends.
E: V.O.
C: JOHN
D: Hey guys, can I play?
N: The kids all look at him. KID #1/#2/#3 Get outta here! / Get outta here, Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett! The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John.
C: GREENBAUM
D: Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!
N: The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly walks back toward his house.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER
C: NARRATOR
D: John longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own. And he knew that if he ever found that friend, he would never let him go.
E: V.O.
N: John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands, looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.
C: NARRATOR
D: Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came.
E: V.O. MORE
C: NARRATOR
D: All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING
N: A LITTLE GIRL opens a present as her parents look on, smiling. Inside is a My Little Pony. She smiles with delight.
S: INT. ANOTHER SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING
N: A LITTLE BOY opens a present as HIS PARENTS look on, smiling. Inside is a G.I. Joe Hovercraft. The boy is overjoyed.
S: INT. A THIRD SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING
N: ANOTHER LITTLE BOY opens a present as his parents look on, smiling. Inside is a "Darth Vader head" action figure case. The boy opens it up, revealing that it's full of "Star Wars" action figures. The boy jumps around ecstatically.
S: EXT./ESTAB. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING INT. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - SAME
C: NARRATOR
D: And for little John Bennett, Christmas Day brought a very special new arrival.
E: V.O.
N: John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear. The boy holds it with delight.
C: JOHN
D: Wow!
N: HIS MOM AND DAD hug him.
C: JOHN'S DAD
D: I guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh?
C: JOHN'S MOM
D: Merry Christmas, John.
E: KISSING HIM
N: John hugs the teddy bear. It makes a cutesy, high- pitched "I wuv you" sound. John gasps with delight.
C: JOHN
D: He talks!
N: John giggles happily, squeezing the bear to make it talk, as his mom and dad exchange a smile.
C: JOHN
D: I'm gonna name you Teddy.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: John sits on the floor watching the 1980 film "Flash Gordon" on TV. He eats Twizzlers with Ted sitting next to him. Occasionally he gives Ted a "bite."
C: NARRATOR
D: John became instantly attached to Teddy. There was something about that bear that made him feel as if he finally had a friend with whom he could share his deepest secrets.
E: V.O.
S: INT. JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT
C: JOHN
D: Hey Teddy... can I tell you something nobody knows?
N: Teddy looks back at him, expressionless.
C: JOHN
D: Last week, my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic. And they have this duck pond there, and... when nobody was looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck. Was that mean?
E: CONT'D
N: He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the "I wuv you" sound.
C: JOHN
D: I love you too, Teddy!
E: CONT'D HUGGING HIM
N: John gets into bed with the teddy bear, and snuggles with it.
C: JOHN
D: You know... I wish you could really talk to me. Because then we could be best friends forever and ever.
E: CONT'D
N: John drifts off to sleep. The camera moves toward the window, and drifts outside. It pulls back from the house slowly.
C: NARRATOR
D: Now, if there's one thing you can be sure of... it's that nothing is more powerful than a young boy's wish. Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles. It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry. An absolute death machine. Well, as it turned out, John picked the perfect night to make a wish.
E: V.O. BEAT
S: EXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The camera pivots around to face the sky. We see the snow falling from moonlit clouds. At the center of the clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by through the opening.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: SLOWLY PUSH IN on the teddy bear's face as John lies sleeping next to it.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NEXT MORNING
N: The house and yard are covered with snow.
S: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SAME
N: John slowly opens his eyes. He turns over to face Teddy, but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John bolts upright and looks around, frantically.
C: JOHN
D: Teddy? Teddy?!
E: beat, a bit more concerned
N: John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there. He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter, assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.
C: JOHN
D: Teddy?
E: CONT'D
N: John sits up again and freezes, looking right into the camera, wide eyed. ANGLE ON JOHN'S P.O.V.: We see the face of Teddy staring right at him. Teddy blinks once.
C: TEDDY
D: Hug me.
N: John yelps and stumbles back, falling over. He stares at Teddy, breathing heavily.
C: JOHN
D: Did you... did you just talk?
C: TEDDY
D: You're my best friend, John.
C: JOHN
D: You're alive?!
E: BEAT
C: TEDDY
D: Uh-huh.
C: JOHN
D: Whoa...
C: TEDDY
D: Don't look so surprised. You're the one who wished for it, aren't you?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, I... I did wish for it.
C: TEDDY
D: Well, here I am.
C: JOHN
D: You mean... we get to be best friends... for real?
C: TEDDY
D: For real.
C: JOHN
D: Forever and ever?
C: TEDDY
D: Sounds good to me.
N: A huge grin spreads across John's face. He gets up, runs to Teddy and hugs him.
C: NARRATOR
D: John was just about the happiest boy in the world. And he couldn't wait to tell everyone the good news.
E: V.O.
S: INT. KITCHEN - SHORTLY AFTER
N: John's Dad sits at the breakfast table, reading the paper as John's Mom prepares eggs and bacon, putting it on their plates.
C: JOHN'S MOM
D: Well, I think we had a wonderful Christmas this year.
C: JOHN'S DAD
D: One of the best. And I particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night.
E: SLYLY
N: John runs into the kitchen.
C: JOHN
D: Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's alive!
N: John's Mom and Dad look at each other and smile.
C: JOHN'S MOM
D: Really, sweetie? Well, that's exciting.
E: PLAYING ALONG
C: JOHN
D: No mom, he's alive! For real! Look!
N: Teddy walks in and stands next to John.
C: TEDDY
D: Merry Christmas, everybody!
N: John's Dad scrambles to his feet, knocking plates off the table. John's mom screams.
C: JOHN'S DAD
D: Jesus H. Fuck!
C: TEDDY
D: Let's all be best friends!
C: JOHN'S MOM
D: Oh my god...
C: JOHN'S DAD
D: John, get away from that thing! Come over here, right now!
C: JOHN
D: BUT DAD--
C: JOHN'S DAD
D: GET OVER HERE!
N: John reluctantly walks over to his dad, who grabs him and protectively pulls him aside.
C: JOHN'S DAD
D: Helen, get my gun.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Dad, no!
C: TEDDY
D: Is it a hugging gun?
C: JOHN'S DAD
D: Helen, get my gun, and call the police!
C: TEDDY
D: I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn't mean to scare anybody. I just wanted John and I to be friends.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, Dad! I made a wish last night that Teddy was alive, and my wish came true!
C: JOHN'S MOM
D: My god, Steve... it's a miracle. A Christmas miracle.
E: ASTONISHED WHISPER
N: They stare at Teddy for a beat.
C: NARRATOR
D: Well, it wasn't long before the story of John's little miracle was sweeping the nation.

N: Over the following, we continue to pull back from the room to the outside of the moonlit house...
C: NARRATOR
D: So where are John and Teddy today? Well, let me put it this way: no matter how big a splash you make in this world, whether you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber, or a talking teddy bear, eventually nobody gives a shit. SMASH CUT TO:
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BOSTON SKYLINE - MORNING

N: John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss.

He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there like an idiot.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO)
N: John, Lori, and Ted sit on the couch. All three sit with their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of Jorian Hill Syrah to camera in identical poses, the wine bottle on the table in front of them.

S: EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - MORNING INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME
N: CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's been around for three decades. He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too- worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted passes the bong to John.
C: TED
D: All I'm sayin' is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life.
C: JOHN
D: That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's hot.
C: TED
D: Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl.
C: JOHN
D: They're not that bad.
N: John takes a hit from the bong over Ted's next line.
C: TED
D: The fact that you have to say they're not that bad means that they are that bad. They turn into drunk, half-white, half- pink monsters after 2 hours at any beach.
N: Ted takes a hit from the bong.
C: TED
D: Jesus, this is weak. It's not even gettin' me high. I gotta have a talk with my weed guy.
E: CONT'D COUGHS
C: JOHN
D: I-- It's workin' for me.
C: TED
D: I think it sucks, I'm gonna have a talk with him.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints.
C: TED
D: No, I know this guy a long time. I've known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, "Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get high."
C: JOHN
D: Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work.
E: looks at his watch
N: John gets up, and hurries into the other room to get dressed.
C: TED
D: Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds.
C: JOHN
D: Jesus, I don't know if I can drive.
E: O.S.
C: TED
D: I'll drive you, I feel fine.
S: EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS
N: We see two shots of John's car driving through the city: We see John in the passenger's seat putting Visine into his eyes, with only Ted's ears and eyes showing as he drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge.
S: EXT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - MORNING
N: John's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot, scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of the rental cars.
C: JOHN/TED
D: Aw, Jesus. / Fuck.
N: ANGLE ON Ted's feet. There are wooden blocks attached to the pedals so that his feet can reach them. He slams on the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and looks at the damage.
C: JOHN
D: Aw, man.
C: TED
D: Is it bad?
C: JOHN
D: It's not good.
N: ANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the doorway.
C: THOMAS
D: John! May I speak with you, please?
C: JOHN
D: Shit.
C: TED
D: It's okay, go, go, I'll pull outta here. Hi, Thomas! How are ya?
E: WAVING
N: Thomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking.
C: OTHER DRIVER
D: Asshole!
C: TED
D: Easy, Jersey license!
E: OVERLAPPING
N: Ted drives away.
S: INT. THOMAS' OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER
N: Thomas sits at his desk facing John.
C: THOMAS
D: John, it's almost ten o'clock.
C: JOHN
D: I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault.
C: THOMAS
D: What do you mean?
C: JOHN
D: I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question.
E: BEAT
C: THOMAS
D: John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when I go to corporate next month. You will be the new branch manager. All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you're doing is fucking up. Not that I don't think you're too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office. The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been here three fucking years longer than him. But I'm telling you, I will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time. That is all. Fuck.
C: JOHN
D: Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me.
C: THOMAS
D: Good. I like hearing that. Because in a month my life now could be your life: a cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It's not a bad life, is it?
C: JOHN
D: N--no.
C: THOMAS
D: Did you know I'm friends with Tom Skerritt?
C: JOHN
D: No.
C: THOMAS
D: I'll show you something I don't show too many people, because I don't want anyone treating me differently.
N: Thomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom Skerritt.
C: THOMAS
D: That's me and Tom Skerritt.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Wowwww.
E: SLIGHTLY OVERDONE
C: THOMAS
D: Goddamn right, wow. Now get outta here. I'm gonna dock you for being late, and for the scratch on that car. Try and be a little more responsible tomorrow.
C: JOHN
D: I will, sir. Thank you. I won't let you down, Goose.
C: THOMAS
D: What?
C: JOHN
D: Top Gun.
C: THOMAS
D: So?
C: JOHN
D: Tom Skerritt.
C: THOMAS
D: Oh.
N: John exits.
S: INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR FRONT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: John emerges from Thomas' office, and walks out into the front desk area. We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and a little bruised.
C: GUY
D: There you go, here's your key and rental agreement, and a complimentary map of Boston. Thanks for choosing Liberty, drive safely.
C: HUSBAND/WIFE
D: Thank you./Thanks so much.
N: The couple exits. Guy turns to face John.
C: GUY
D: Hey, heard you got busted.
C: JOHN
D: Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened?
C: GUY
D: I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted last night, and my phone says I texted somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same person saying thanks.
C: JOHN
D: And you don't remember it?
C: GUY
D: No. Same as last time.
C: JOHN
D: It... it just seems gay, doesn't it?
C: GUY
D: I don't know. Maybe, yeah.
C: JOHN
D: Do you think you're part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld? Like one of those gay beat-up clubs?
C: GUY
D: I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't remember any of it, I was so fucked up. I might be gay, I don't know. You mind covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go lay down in the john.
N: Guy starts to leave, when ALIX, a foreign guy with a vague European accent, long dark hair, and a great tan walks up.
C: ALIX
D: Hey you buddies. Where's it hanging?
C: GUY/JOHN
D: Hey Alix. / Hey, how was the club last night?
C: ALIX
D: Ah, I didn't get in because the bouncer was doucheface, but I made friends in the line.
C: GUY
D: Oh, well, that's good I guess.
N: We see TANYA, an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter from the back with a set of keys.
C: TANYA
D: Hi you guys.
N: Over the following, Tanya puts the keys away, walks over to her station and sits.
C: ALIX
D: You look so pretty today.
C: TANYA
D: Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this morning.
C: ALIX
D: I can tell, you are less fat than you have been.
C: JOHN
D: Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant? Like something where the napkins are cloth?
C: GUY
D: For what?
C: JOHN
D: Lori and I have been dating four years tomorrow, and I wanted to take her someplace nice.
C: TANYA
D: Oh wow, congratulations, John.
C: GUY
D: You guys`ve been goin' out for four years?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah.
C: GUY THAT'S IN--
D: --saaaane, my longest relationship was like six months, and then she farted in her sleep. I'm like, I am outta here, man. Was gone before she woke up.
E: HIGH-PITCHED
C: JOHN
D: Wow, you're... not very tolerant, huh.
C: GUY
D: Lori ever fart in front of you?
C: JOHN
D: Yes.
C: GUY
D: Really.
C: JOHN
D: Yes. Many times.
C: GUY
D: You Italian?
C: JOHN
D: No.
C: GUY
D: Oh.
C: JOHN
D: Why?
C: GUY
D: I dunno, just seems like-- never mind, take her to Benihana.
C: TANYA
D: Don't you think after four years, maybe she's probably hoping for something more than dinner?
C: JOHN
D: Like what?
C: TANYA
D: Well, if I were her, I'd be expecting a proposal.
C: JOHN
D: Oh come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose. Marriage isn't... I mean, isn't love enough? I submit that love is enough.
C: GUY
D: You could put the ring in her ass and let her fart it out.
S: EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME
N: John and Ted sit on the couch, in the same exact spots we saw them earlier, bookending the day. John drinks a beer as they watch TV. Ted lights up a bong and inhales. The TV blares the opening titles of the 1980 film "Flash Gordon." As "Flash's Theme" plays:
C: JOHN
D: So bad, but so good.
C: TED
D: Yes, a study in contrasts.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, I love this part. HE'S FOR EVERY ONE OF US!
E: SINGING ALONG
C: TED
D: STAND FOR EVERY ONE OF US!
E: SINGING ALONG
C: JOHN
D: HE'LL SAVE WITH A MIGHTY HAND/EVERY MAN EVERY WOMAN EVERY CHILD WITH A MIGHTY FLASH!
E: SINGING ALONG
C: TED
D: Fuck yeah, Flash! Hey, before I forget, let's nail down a plan for the Bruins game tomorrow night.
E: then
C: JOHN
D: I can't, I'm taking Lori to dinner.
C: TED
D: For what?
C: JOHN
D: Well, we've been dating four years tomorrow.
C: TED
D: Oh, fuck me. Nice.
C: JOHN
D: Lemme ask you something... you don't think she's gonna be expecting something... big, do you?
C: TED
D: What, like anal?
E: BEAT
C: JOHN
D: No, like... a circular gold thing on the finger.
C: TED
D: Oh, fuck that! It's four years! You and I have been together 27 years!
N: Ted jumps on John, and starts playfully punching him in the face.
C: TED
D: Where's my ring, Johnny? Where's my ring, asshole?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Stop it! Jesus Christ, knock it off! He throws Ted off of him.
C: JOHN
D: I mean, do you think she might be expecting me to make that kinda move?
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: No, John. It's a bad idea. And it's the wrong time. What with the economy and... the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.
C: JOHN
D: I guess I didn't think about that.
N: ANGLE ON TV - We see Flash Gordon facing Ming the Merciless.
C: KLYTUS
D: Who are you?
E: ON TV
C: FLASH
D: Flash Gordon. Quarterback. New York Jets.
E: ON TV
C: JOHN
D: This is the American fantasy, right here. A professional NFL player is called upon to save the world.
C: TED
D: Tom Brady could do that.
C: JOHN
D: Tom Brady could do that. The front door opens and LORI, an attractive girl in her mid to late 20's, enters holding several grocery bags.
C: LORI
D: Hi guys.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, sweetie.
C: TED
D: Hey, Lori.
N: John gets up and gives Lori a kiss.
C: LORI
D: Ooh. I think you just got me stoned.
C: JOHN
D: What do we got there?
E: RE: GROCERIES
C: LORI
D: Turkey burgers.
C: TED
D: Oh. Okay. Are we having homos over for dinner or something?
C: LORI
D: No, just you homos.
E: WISEASS
C: TED/JOHN
D: Whoa!!!
C: TED
D: She's funny, John. You got yourself a regular Toni Collette.
C: LORI
D: Wait, who's that? Is that good?
C: JOHN
D: She's a comedienne.
C: LORI
D: Oh nice. Is she pretty?
C: JOHN
D: She's as pretty as she is funny. How was work?
C: LORI
D: Good.
C: JOHN
D: How's your dickhead boss?
C: LORI
D: Rex is fine. He only hit on me once today, so that's good.
C: JOHN
D: I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia.
C: LORI
D: He's harmless, I can handle it.
C: TED
D: Hey Johnny, while you're up, grab me a beer, huh?
C: JOHN
D: Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis?
E: crossing to fridge
C: TED
D: Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now.
N: We see Lori roll her eyes. She's heard this before.
C: LORI
D: Jesus.
C: JOHN
D: Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski?
C: TED
D: Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski?
C: LORI
D: Y'know, I think I might also have a Martina Navra-ti-brewski.
C: JOHN/TED
D: Ohhhh, that doesn't work!/Come on, don't ruin it, yeah, that doesn't work.
C: LORI
D: Bullshit, what do you mean?
C: JOHN
D: It doesn't work, the name has to have a "ski" at the end of it. You just put "brewski" on the end of Martina Navratolova.
C: LORI
D: I thought we were just doing funny names.
C: TED
D: No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end. Otherwise where's the challenge? If there's no "ski" at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying nonsense.
S: EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: It's raining, with an occasional roll of thunder.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME
N: Lori lies in bed holding an iPad, reading a gossip news site, with the TV on. John comes out of the bathroom, and cozies up next to her.
C: LORI
D: Oh, look, they found those missing hikers.
E: OFF IPAD
C: JOHN
D: They did? What happened?
C: LORI
D: It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days.
C: JOHN
D: You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I'd chew it off to get you free.
C: LORI
D: You would?
E: SWEETLY
C: JOHN
D: I sure would. Is that cannibalism?
E: BEAT
C: LORI
D: No, I think it's only cannibalism if you swallow.
C: JOHN
D: Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow.
N: She laughs.
C: LORI
D: Really? That's not what I heard about you.
C: JOHN
D: It's not true, I'm a fuckin' classy broad.
C: LORI
D: I can see that. Y'know, speaking of classy, Ciao Bella's a really expensive restaurant. If you want, we can go somewhere else tomorrow night. I don't care, as long as we're together.
E: LAUGHS AGAIN THEN
C: JOHN
D: You kiddin' me? Four years we been going out, I'm takin' you to the best place in town. I been crappin' out room for it for two days, I know exactly what I'm gonna order.
C: LORI
D: You're disgusting.
E: leaning in to kiss him
C: JOHN
D: And you get to pick any bottle of wine.
C: LORI
D: Ooh.
C: JOHN
D: Any bottle of 2012 wine.
C: LORI
D: Oh, are the new wines in?
C: JOHN
D: They are in and they. Are. Fresh.
N: She leans over and kisses him again. He kisses her back.
C: JOHN
D: I love you.
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: I love you, too.
N: They continue to kiss, becoming more and more intimate. She starts to pull his T-shirt off, when there is a thunder clap from outside.
C: JOHN
D: Ah, come on!
C: LORI
D: I don't understand it, 35 years old, and you're still scared of a little thunder.
E: shaking her head
C: JOHN
D: I am not. We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with no warning and leaps into bed, right between Lori and John.
C: TED
D: Thunder buddies for life, right Johnny? C'mon, let's sing the thunder song!
C: JOHN/TED
D: WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF THUNDER, DON'T YOU GET TOO SCARED / JUST GRAB YOUR THUNDER BUDDY AND SAY THESE MAGIC WORDS: FUCK YOU THUNDER, YOU CAN EAT MY ASS / YOU CAN'T GET ME THUNDER, `CAUSE YOU'RE JUST GOD'S FARTS.
E: SINGING
C: TED
D: Boomp.
N: Lori rolls over and goes to sleep with a groan.
S: EXT./ ESTAB. BOSTON HIGH RISE - DAY
N: Lori enters the building.
S: INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Lori gets off the elevator, where we see several signs that read "PLYMOUTH PUBLIC RELATIONS." Lori goes to her desk, looking exhausted. Lori's office friends, GINA, MICHELLE, and TRACY approach.
C: GINA
D: Wow...Baby, I'm not saying this to be nasty, but you look really tired.
C: LORI
D: Oh, I'm okay... except I didn't have time for breakfast, the garage was full, I spilled coffee on my leg, and I have a boyfriend who can't sleep through a storm without his teddy bear.
C: GINA
D: I don't understand why you keep putting up with him.
C: TRACY
D: Yeah, I mean, the guy's thirty-five years old and he's working for a rental car service.
C: LORI
D: No, it's not that, I don't care about that. I'd love him even if he was a janitor. I mean, he's got a huge heart, we laugh together all the time, and it's just a bonus that he's like the hottest guy in Boston.
C: GINA
D: Yeah but the hottest guy in Boston is like being the classiest Kardashian.
C: LORI
D: I just wish he could get his life together, you know? Our life. And he can't, and I swear to god, it's all because of that bear.
C: MICHELLE
D: You should give him an ultimatum: it's you or the bear.
C: LORI
D: I can't do that, he'd be devastated. And I mean... what if he chose Ted?
C: MICHELLE
D: Oh come on, you don't really think that.
C: LORI
D: Not really, but what if?
C: MICHELLE
D: Well then... things happen for a reason.
C: TRACY
D: No they don't. That's just something girls say when something bad happens to them that they don't understand.
C: GINA
D: Fuck off, Tracy.
S: INT. OFFICE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Lori's boss REX (asshole handsome, mid-30's, expensive suit) walks into the office, and approaches the gathering of female employees.
C: REX
D: Well hello there. Sorry if I'm interrupting any private girl talk about Channing Tatum's index finger but Lori I need to see you in my office.
C: LORI
D: Actually Rex, I have a lot of work I need to get to--
C: REX
D: Oh, this is work, I swear.
C: LORI
D: Okay, fine.
E: SIGH
N: Lori follows Rex and gives the girls a "help!" look.
C: MICHELLE
D: He's such an asshole.
C: GINA
D: Out of control. Such a sleaze.
C: TRACY
D: You guys are so pathetic. You're shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him.
N: Short beat.
C: GINA/MICHELLE
D: Like once./I was drunk.
C: GINA
D: And so did you.
C: TRACY
D: Well, I didn't want one of you whores getting promoted before me.
S: INT. REX'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Lori sits across from Rex, who sits at a large desk.
C: LORI
D: So... what do you need to talk to me about, Rex?
N: Rex takes a framed picture out of a drawer, and shows it to her.
C: REX
D: See that? That's me on the diving team in high school. We dove the shit outta that pool that year. If you look close, you can see the outline of my root.
C: LORI
D: You promised this was about work.
E: ANNOYED
C: REX
D: Lori, what is wrong with you? Why don't you like me? I'm rich, I'm good-looking, my dad owns the company--
C: LORI
D: I have a boyfriend, Rex. I think you know this.
C: REX
D: Yeah, the guy with the teddy bear, that's a cute relationship, but I'm talking about being with a real man, Lori.
E: MORE
C: REX
D: Someone who wears a blazer on an airplane.
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: I'm very busy.
E: STANDING UP
C: REX
D: Well then, how do you have all that time to be in my head?
C: LORI
D: Goodbye, Rex.
N: Lori exits Rex's office. Rex casually gets up, strolls over to her chair, nonchalantly brushes his hand on the cushion where she was sitting, and nonchalantly smells his hand.
S: INT./ ESTAB. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT, NEWBURY STREET -
N: NIGHT
S: INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
N: John and Lori sit across from each other at a romantically set table. They've just finished their meal. John has the remains of a lobster shell on his plate.
C: LORI
D: That was perfect.
E: SATISFIED SIGH
N: A WAITRESS approaches.
C: WAITRESS
D: Would you like me to wrap up your leftovers?
C: LORI
D: Oh no, I'm fine, thanks.
N: John holds up the front portion of the lobster shell, which has the face and eyes on it.
C: JOHN
D: Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta somebody.
C: WAITRESS
D: Sure.
E: BEAT
N: The waitress walks away.
C: LORI
D: What are you, five years old?
E: MILDLY AMUSED
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level.
N: Another WAITER approaches with a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and some chocolate-covered strawberries.
C: WAITER
D: Senor. Senora, here is your dessert and champagne.
C: LORI
D: Ooh, Cristal.
C: JOHN
D: It's a special night. We've been dating for four years. And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right?
E: TAKING BOTTLE
C: LORI
D: It doesn't seem like four years, does it?
C: JOHN
D: (affectionately taking her
C: HAND)
D: No, it doesn't.
C: LORI
D: You had no business being out on that dance floor, but I'm glad you were.
S: INT. CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a girl, and doing it very badly. He's putting too much into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move, accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up, when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.
C: JOHN
D: Oh my god, are you okay? Oh god, I'm so sorry!
C: LORI
D: Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
E: a little stunned
C: JOHN
D: Oh Jesus, I'm so so sorry! I didn't see you! It was an accident!
C: LORI
D: Well, yeah, I... I would hope it was an accident.
C: JOHN
D: Did you hurt your head?
C: LORI
D: Um, yes. My head hurts a lot.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice.
N: She sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment.
C: JOHN
D: Sorry. Does it hurt?
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: (beat, noticing him for the
C: FIRST TIME)
D: N... No. No it's okay.
C: JOHN
D: I'm... I'm John.
E: beat, noticing too
C: LORI
D: I'm Lori.
N: They smile at each other...
S: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)
C: LORI
D: Okay, here's a question that'll show how much you actually care about me. You remember we stayed and talked until the place closed, and then we went for late night eggs and waffles, and we stayed there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the little TV in the diner. Name the movie.
C: JOHN
D: Octopussy.
C: LORI
D: Gold star.
C: JOHN
D: But does that show that I care about you, or I care about Roger Moore?
C: LORI
D: I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt.
C: JOHN
D: Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad.
C: LORI
D: Your dancing was bad.
E: LAUGHING
C: JOHN
D: I had some cool moves.
C: LORI
D: So do people with Parkinson's.
C: JOHN
D: That's not how I remember it.
C: LORI
D: Yeah, how do you remember it?
S: INT. SMOKY TAVERN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: We see John leaning against the bar, wearing a white Navy officer's uniform, a la Ted Stryker in "Airplane!" as "Stayin' Alive" blasts from the jukebox. ANGLE ON LORI, who is up on the dance floor, done up like Julie Hagerty. John takes his hat off, and tosses it O.S. coolly. He struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori. They circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses it O.S. He then strikes a "finger up" disco pose, with a bullet SFX. He and Lori begin disco dancing simultaneously. He jumps up, locking his legs around Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to:
S: INT. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)
C: LORI
D: Whatever you say, baby.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, here's to four more years, huh?
N: They clink glasses, and take a sip.
C: JOHN
D: Now I know we said no gifts, but--
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: No, we didn't.
C: JOHN
D: --But, I got you something anyway, in clear violation of the "no gift" rule.
C: LORI
D: There was no such rule. John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small box. Lori looks excited.
C: JOHN
D: Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for a long time.
N: John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.
C: LORI
D: Oh, John.
N: Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.
C: JOHN
D: Those are the ones you liked, right? From that kiosk at the mall?
C: LORI
D: Oh. Yeah.
C: JOHN
D: Check out the card.
N: She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it. It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you."
C: JOHN
D: See, I even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldn't get bored while you were reading it.
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: Great. Thanks. Well, um, here. This is for you.
E: UNENTHUSED
N: Lori hands John a small box. He opens it up, revealing a very nice watch.
C: JOHN
D: Oh wow, a Hamilton!
E: OPENS BOX
N: He puts it on his wrist.
C: LORI
D: I remember you liked it when you saw Tom Brady wearing one in GQ.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it! She reacts a bit to this.
C: JOHN
D: Y'know, Lori... Someday, there's gonna be a ring in there. But I wanna wait `til I can get you something really special, y'know? I just don't have the money right now.
E: CONT'D INDICATING BOX
C: LORI
D: John, I don't need the Hope diamond, all I want is--
C: JOHN
D: I know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.
C: LORI
D: Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, Jesus, here we go--
C: LORI
D: John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives.
C: JOHN
D: Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner?
C: LORI
D: Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten years from now.
C: JOHN
D: (rolling his eyes with a
C: SIGH)
D: Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. Look, he's been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He's the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out.
C: LORI
D: Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you're not eight. You're thirty-five. And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. You have me. And I love you.
C: JOHN
D: I love you, too. You know that.
C: LORI
D: Look, I've put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens.
C: JOHN
D: Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards.
N: She laughs. So does he.
C: LORI
D: And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you.
C: JOHN
D: I can do it all with one hand.
C: LORI
D: Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand.
C: JOHN
D: I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller.
C: LORI
D: We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other.
N: They both laugh hard.
C: JOHN
D: Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship.
C: LORI
D: We can't put the real conversation off forever, John.
E: SIGH
C: JOHN
D: I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes.
S: EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Their car pulls up. They start to get out.
C: JOHN
D: Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere. Can you call it?
E: NOTICING
N: Lori punches his number on her cellphone. After a beat, we hear The Imperial March from "The Empire Strikes Back."
C: LORI
D: That's my ringtone?
C: JOHN
D: Oh, yeah...
E: laughs, embarrassed
C: LORI
D: What is it? It sounds negative.
C: JOHN
D: No, it's from The Notebook.
N: He reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she goes inside.
C: JOHN
D: This is gonna take some doin'.
E: CONT'D STRAINING

S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Lori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women. They're watching "Romancing the Stone," which plays very loudly on the TV.
C: LORI
D: What the hell is all this?!
C: TED
D: Lori! Hey, you're home early! The ladies and I were just watching "Romancing the Stone." Got it on Blu- Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of the Nile," but I don't know that we'll end up watchin' that one.
C: LORI
D: This place is a wreck! Who are these girls?
C: TED
D: Oh, where are my manners? Lori, this is Angelique, Heavenly, Cherene, and Sauvignon Blanc. I love you girls. Y'know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers I wish I could thank for this great night.
N: The girls ad-lib "Hello," "Nice to meet you," etc. Lori glances around the room, then SCREAMS as she sees something in the corner.
C: LORI
D: What is that?!!!
C: TED
D: What's what?
C: LORI
D: There is... a shit in the corner! On the floor! There's a shit!
C: TED
D: Oh man, that's what Dierdre was doin' over there in the corner for so long. Remember, she was crouched over there and I thought she was just makin' a call or SOMETHIN'--
E: LOOKING OVER
C: LORI
D: There is a shit!! On my floor!!
C: TED
D: Yeah, she's passed out in the bathroom now, she seemed like she was hopped up on somethin'. I mean, mystery solved, I GUESS--
C: LORI
D: What the fuck!!!!
C: TED
D: Lori, if I can-- now this is just speculation, but... is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner, and more about maybe tonight's dinner not measuring up to your expectations?
C: LORI
D: What!!! The fuck!!!
N: Lori is speechless with rage. At that moment, we see the lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door.
C: JOHN
D: RAAARRRR!!
E: V.O.

C: JOHN
D: Who lives here? I'm comin' to get whoever lives here! You owe me lobster money!

E: TO GIRL

N: Ted and John walk slowly down the ramp circling the massive see-through tank, occasionally stopping to observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish. John is oddly restrained. Something is on his mind. As they stroll, we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them. He seems much more interested in them than in the fish. This, we will find out later, is DONNY...
C: TED
D: God, there are some fucked up fish out there.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah.
C: TED
D: Jesus, look at that one. Mister tough guy fish. "Hey! Whatsa big idea? Cold fusion? Well that is a big idea, I beg pardon!" Look at that guy. WASP-y white guy fish.

D: "Oh hey, sorry I'm late, guys. Hey, where's everybody goin'? Any of you guys got a tissue? I'm allergic to water."
C: JOHN
D: Ted... you gotta move out.
N: Ted turns and stares at John for a beat.
C: TED
D: Wh... what?
C: JOHN
D: It's... it's gotta happen. Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed.
C: TED
D: What...what did I do?
N: John looks heartbroken at this response.
S: INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ted and John sit side-by-side on a bench next to the penguin habitat.
C: JOHN
D: Ted, my relationship is at a very delicate stage, and, y'know, Lori and I may just need a little space right now. Plus a hooker took a shit in our apartment.
C: TED
D: Hey, look, that was a tough night for all of us.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: Lori is staring at the O.S. poop in the corner. She is trying to pick it up with a shoebox. In the background, we can see an almost panicky, grossed-out John peering out from behind the bathroom door.
C: LORI
D: Oh, god!!
E: BEYOND DISGUSTED
C: JOHN
D: Aaaa, what?!
C: LORI
D: It's so gross!!
C: JOHN
D: Don't tell me, I don't wanna hear about it! Did you get it?
C: LORI
D: No! Oh my god!
C: JOHN
D: Tell me when you get it!
C: LORI
D: AAAA, I got some on my thumb!
C: JOHN
D: AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- handed!
C: LORI
D: Shit!
C: JOHN
D: I'll get the next one, okay?
S: INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - DAY
C: TED
D: She's makin' you do it, isn't she?
C: JOHN
D: Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time!
E: giving up the bullshit
C: TED
D: What about... thunder buddies for life, Johnny?
C: JOHN
D: I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted.
C: TED
D: I know you do, Johnny.
E: SIGH
C: JOHN
D: I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise.
C: TED
D: And we'll hang out a lot, right?
C: JOHN
D: Fuck, all the time.
C: TED
D: Bring it over here.
E: arms wide for a hug
N: John hugs Ted. Ted hugs him back. We hear a squeak, and a high-pitched recorded voice saying "I wuv you." John and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably.
C: TED JOHN
D: That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no, I know- that doesn't mean-- I'm not - gay.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: We've got to get you a job.
S: EXT./ ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME
N: John and Ted head toward the store. Ted is dressed in a coat and tie, and looks very uncomfortable.
C: TED
D: I look stupid.
C: JOHN
D: No, you don't. You look dapper.
C: TED
D: I look like Snuggles' accountant.
N: They pause as John straightens Ted's tie.
C: JOHN
D: Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment.
C: TED
D: I don't wanna work at a grocery store.
C: JOHN
D: Well, you have no skills.
C: TED
D: I told you, I can totally be a lawyer.
C: JOHN
D: As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school.
C: TED
D: I'm a special case. I'm a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception `cause they're all like, "Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's give him a job and maybe he'll give us a few laughs," but then they're surprised at what a stellar performance I'm turnin' in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case.
C: JOHN
D: Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after.
N: John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed.
C: TED
D: And if I don't get the job will we still smoke that pot?
C: JOHN
D: Probably, yes.
C: TED
D: Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach.
E: patting John on the leg
S: INT. GROCERY STORE MANAGER'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER
N: Ted sits opposite FRANK, the grocery store manager. We see his name and title on a desk nameplate. Frank sits at the desk, staring at Ted.
C: FRANK
D: So. You think you got what it takes?
C: TED
D: Nope.
C: FRANK
D: No one's ever talked to me like that before. You're hired.
E: a beat, then
C: TED
D: Shit.
S: EXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON
N: (Over music:) John and Ted walk across the Common, passing various park-goers. The occasional person notices and points with a "Hey, isn't that..." sort of look. They passes three cute girls who flag Ted down. Two pose with him as the third takes their picture with her cellphone. Ted poses for the photo with one hand on the girl's breast. She laughs hard. Ted waves goodbye, and he and John make their way over to a park bench. They sit. John takes out the weed, looks around for a beat, then starts to discreetly roll a joint.
C: TED
D: Well, I'm a former celebrity with a minimum wage job. This must be what the cast of Different Strokes feels like.
C: O.S. VOICE
D: Excuse me.
N: John and Ted react, startled. John stuffs the weed in his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling papers on the ground. ANGLE ON a creepy-looking man glancing at them repeatedly. This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the prologue. He has grown up into a thinner but no less creepy man.
C: DONNY
D: I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.
N: ADJUST TO REVEAL his son, who looks exactly like fat young Donny from earlier.
C: JOHN
D: Oh. Um, thank you.
E: a little uncomfortable
C: DONNY
D: I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert. I have to tell you, I've been fascinated by your story ever since I was a boy. I remember seeing you on the Carson show. You were just wonderful.
N: BRIEF ANGLE ON the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at the dropped weed.
C: TED
D: Yeah, that was ah... that was a good time.
C: DONNY
D: I wonder, is there any chance I could purchase the bear from you? For my son?
E: TO JOHN
C: JOHN/TED
D: Huh? / Excuse me?
C: ROBERT
D: I want it.
E: CALM
C: TED
D: Hey, I'm not an "it", pal. I'm a "he."
C: JOHN
D: I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale. I've had him since I was about your age. He's very special to me.
E: leaning down to his level
C: ROBERT
D: Sit up straight when you talk to me.
C: JOHN
D: Ew, why the fuck did he say that?
E: RECOILING
C: DONNY
D: Don't swear in front of my child. Now. We are very interested in the bear. If you'd like to work out some sort of arrangement, here's my address and phone number.
N: He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.
C: JOHN
D: Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff.
N: Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a glance back at Ted as they move off.
C: TED
D: Wow. Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me?
C: JOHN
D: Oh man, I can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme.
N: John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out. He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.
C: JOHN
D: OH, MY LITTLE SIXPENCE/MY PRETTY LITTLE SIXPENCE/I LOVE MY SIXPENCE BETTER THAN MY LIFE.
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so far? Now it's real. Fuck you again for that. C'mon, let's go find a better place to get stoned.
N: They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame, slamming right into a fucking tree.
S: EXT. ESTAB. A SHITTY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: John and Ted walk into the building. John carries two cardboard boxes, and Ted carries one smaller one.
S: INT. AN ALMOST EMPTY APARTMENT - SAME
N: There's a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes. John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside the doorway.
C: JOHN
D: Well... I guess this is it, huh?
C: TED
D: Yeah, sure is.
C: JOHN
D: First night on your own.
C: TED
D: Yeah. First night in my beautiful new apartment. They say they're ain't hardly been no murders here.
N: They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John must leave soon.
C: JOHN
D: Okay... so... if you need anything...
C: TED
D: I know.
C: JOHN
D: Seriously, anything...
C: TED
D: I know. I'll be fine, Johnny.
C: JOHN
D: I know you will, buddy.
E: BEAT
N: They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly turns and walks off down the hall. He turns back to smile and wave. From John's POV, we see a diminutive- looking Ted give a wan wave back. He looks very alone as the camera recedes.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: John sits on the couch, putting his tie on as he watches TV. Lori comes over and sits down next to him.
C: LORI
D: Hey there.
C: JOHN
D: Hey.
C: LORI
D: Listen... I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn't easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our relationship.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him.
N: She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie.
C: LORI
D: Y'know, I don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes...
C: JOHN
D: (guiding her down onto the
C: COUCH)
D: Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need one.
N: She laughs, and they kiss.
C: LORI
D: You know what my favorite thing about you is? After four years, you can still surprise me. To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier... I dunno, I bet you most guys couldn't do it.
C: JOHN
D: Most guys don't have you to motivate `em.
C: LORI
D: I'm sorry if I was pushy about it...
C: JOHN
D: No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It's `cause you're... inevitable.
C: LORI
D: Inevitable. Well, that's... romantic? I think?
E: huh?
C: JOHN
D: No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're inevitable.
C: LORI
D: That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend.
C: JOHN
D: But do you get what I'm saying?
C: LORI
D: Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same way about you.
N: They kiss.
C: LORI
D: (smiling coyly, as she
E: CONT'D
C: NOTICES)
D: Ooh. Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me?
N: John pulls the Flash Gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her. She cracks up.
S: EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY INT. GROCERY STORE - SAME
N: Ted is at his station, finishing checking out a customer.
C: TED
D: Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries.
N: The customer exits. Ted sighs with boredom. He turns to ELLEN, the large African-American woman at the next station.
C: TED
D: Hey Ellen?
E: CONT'D
C: ELLEN
D: Yeah?
C: TED
D: Who's that over there?
N: ANGLE ON A VERY ATTRACTIVE blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away (This is TAMI-LYNN).
C: ELLEN
D: That's the new bag girl. I don't know her name, but she seems cute.
C: TED
D: Yeah. Very cute. You know what I'd like to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty Fozzie. Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side, then from the other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs and shakes her head "no."
C: TED
D: Okay, so that's where we'll draw the line.
E: CONT'D TO HIMSELF
S: EXT. ESTAB./ LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - DAY INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - SAME
N: John sits at his workstation, playing a TBD video game on his iPhone. Tanya approaches.
C: TANYA
D: Hey. How you holding up?
C: JOHN
D: Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used to things, that's all.
C: TANYA
D: It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went through something like this with my last boyfriend.
C: JOHN
D: Really?
C: TANYA
D: Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it.
C: JOHN
D: Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost our furry little guy.
C: TANYA
D: Yeah.
N: John's phone rings the theme from "Knight Rider." He sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open- mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a bra on his head. John picks up.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, Ted.
C: TED
D: Johnny. What are you doin'? You wanna come over and catch a buzz?
E: V.O.
C: JOHN
D: I could probably swing by after work.
C: TED
D: Fuck that, I traded off yesterday, so I got the night shift. C'mon, I'm bored as crap over here, just swing by for a bit.
E: V.O.
C: JOHN
D: I can't just ditch work, man. Look, I'm trying to get my shit together and be an adult here, y'know? For Lori's sake.
S: INT. TED'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Ted sits in the tub, talking on the phone. He has suds in his hair, and there are a couple of little toy boats in the water. From here, we intercut back and forth from him and John.
C: TED
D: John. Five minutes. And then I'll kick you out, I promise. C'mon, I picked up the "Cheers" DVD box set, and supposedly everybody talks shit about each other in the interviews.
C: JOHN
D: Really?
C: TED
D: Yeah, and apparently George Wendt confesses to a rape.
C: JOHN
D: Sometimes adults get high.
E: BEAT
C: TED
D: They do, John. Sometimes they do.
C: JOHN
D: You'll kick me out in five.
C: TED
D: John, I have to kick you out. I am extraordinarily busy today, I have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through, it is retarded. Five minutes and you're outta here.
E: V.O.
N: John turns and looks back at Thomas in his office.
C: JOHN
D: What do I tell Thomas?
C: TED
D: Just tell him you don't feel well.
S: INT. THOMAS' OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: John stands in front of Thomas, who sits at his desk.
C: JOHN
D: I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried to break up a dog fight, and I guess she got hurt pretty bad.
C: THOMAS
D: Oh my god.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she sees trouble, she tries to help out, and I guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass.
C: THOMAS
D: Jesus, John.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, she's pretty shook up.
C: THOMAS
D: Oh my god. Up the dog's ass, right?
E: BEAT
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, that's how they--
C: THOMAS
D: That's how they get `em to stop biting, sure.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah.
C: THOMAS
D: Go go go, take care of it, let me know how she is.
C: JOHN
D: Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one.
C: THOMAS
D: You don't owe me anything, go.
N: John smiles wanly, and exits.
C: THOMAS
D: Jesus.
E: CONT'D looking at his own finger
S: EXT./ ESTAB. TED'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY INT. TED'S NEW APARTMENT - SAME
N: ANGLE ON THE TV - Ted Danson sits in a chair, being interviewed.
C: TED DANSON
D: Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"? Hm. Lemme figure out the best way to answer that. Um...are there naked dicks in gay porn? Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine. I mean, it was the eighties. And I was king. I was king of the eighties. I was Ted fucking Danson. And not only that, I was Sam fucking Mayday Malone. Was I popular? Gee, lemme think: are there naked dicks in gay porn? Yes, I was quite beloved.
E: LAUGHS WARMLY LAUGHS WARMLY
N: ANGLE ON Ted and John watching. They have a bong.
C: JOHN
D: You know, he's exactly who you want him to be.
C: TED
D: He is. He is. Someone the likes of which we should all aspire to become.
N: ANGLE BACK ON TV -
C: TED DANSON
D: Woody Harrelson. Smallest dick I've ever seen on a man.
N: ANGLE BACK ON John and Ted -
C: TED
D: Here, try this stuff. I told my guy to step it up, and he gave me this.
E: passing him bong
C: JOHN
D: What is it?
C: TED
D: It's called Kennedy's Head. It's actually pretty mellow.
C: JOHN
D: That doesn't sound very mellow.
C: TED
D: No, it's-- it makes you cerebral. Like Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That's what it refers to. Decisions under pressure. Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it up.
N: John takes a hit off the bong, then glances around.
C: JOHN
D: Y'know, this place looks great.
C: TED
D: Yeah, it's all Ikea. Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars.
C: JOHN
D: How are the neighbors?
C: TED
D: There's an Asian family next door, but they don't have a gong or nothin', so it's fine.
C: JOHN
D: That's lucky.
C: TED
D: How's work?
C: JOHN
D: Sucks.
C: TED
D: Ah.
C: JOHN
D: You?
C: TED
D: It's actualy not bad. Met a girl. She's a bagger.
C: JOHN
D: No way, that's awesome. We should double date, you, me Lori and, what's her name?

D: White trash name. Guess.

S: EXT. ESTAB. RESTAURANT - NIGHT INT. RESTAURANT - SAME
N: John, Ted, Lori and Ted's dolled-up and sort of trashy date Tami-Lynn (the bag girl from the grocery store) eat dinner.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: See, I was all pissed off `cause me and my friend Danielle were supposed to go skydiving last year, but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn't go and I was all upset, but then she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up getting to go skydiving, and it was so scary but it was so much fun.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: I guess god wanted me to go skydiving, y'know?
C: LORI
D: Jesus.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: Or Jesus, yeah, but whatever.
C: TED
D: Hey, isn't this great? The four of us here, having dinner together? Lori, how've you been? Haven't seen you in forever.
C: LORI
D: Um, I've been good. Not much going on. My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something.
C: JOHN
D: Lori's a senior VP at a big PR firm.
E: proud, to Tami-Lynn
C: LORI
D: It's not that big a deal.
C: TED
D: Company's turnin' 20, eh? So you can bang it but you can't get it drunk.
N: Tami-Lynn laughs heartily at this, as does John. Lori isn't quite as delighted.
C: LORI
D: I'm surprised John didn't tell you already. Seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out.
E: VISIBLY ANNOYED
C: TED
D: Well, it's funny, usually the first item on our agenda is "what's goin' on with Lori?" So I'm surprised that one slipped through the cracks.
C: JOHN
D: We do, we talk about you all the time.
C: TED
D: Right?
C: JOHN
D: Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about... how... neat all of Lori's shoes are?
C: TED
D: That was a lengthy conversation.
C: JOHN
D: And we were saying like, a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels, but Lori has a sort of... regal... trot.
C: TED
D: A canter.
C: JOHN
D: Oh my god yes. You canter.
N: Lori stares at him for a beat, then:
C: LORI
D: So, Tami, where are you from? Tell us about yourself. I'm always... fascinated to meet Ted's girlfriends.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: What do you mean girlfriends? Is there like a lot of `em or somethin'?
E: TO TED
C: TED
D: No, no, that's not what she's sayin' at all, right Lori?
C: LORI
D: No, right, I was-- all I was doing was asking. Ted's very... attractive, I'm just always interested in the... type of girl that can snatch him up.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: Did you just call me a whore?
C: LORI
D: What? No, I--
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: You just worry about your own snatch, how `bout that, honey?
C: TED/JOHN
D: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! / What the hell happened? We're havin' a friendly meal here!
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: Don't talk shit to me!
C: LORI
D: I was just asking a question.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: You're a friggin' snob! You think you're all cool cause you work at some fancy shit place!
C: TED
D: It's okay, Tami. Nice, Lori. Real nice.
E: TO LORI
C: LORI
D: What?! It's not my fault she can't speak English.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: Fuck you! Just `cause you're all in the business world and shit, you think everyone's supposed to like, suck your asshole!
C: TED
D: Baby! Baby! Baby. Baby. Let's get outta here. We'll go back to my place for a couple vodka and strawberry Quiks. Okay? See ya, John.
N: Ted and Tami Lynn exit leaving John and Lori at the table.
C: LORI
D: What a cunt.
C: JOHN
D: Ooh! I hate that word.
E: covering ears in pain
C: LORI
D: Huh?
C: JOHN
D: That word is so sharp. It's like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path.
C: LORI
D: Well, you didn't exactly stick up for me.
C: JOHN
D: I... I'm trying to walk a line here, I want to be fair to you and to him, y'know?
C: LORI
D: Yeah, well, I think you're being a little more fair to him.
C: JOHN
D: Come on.
E: SCOFFING
C: LORI
D: Y'know, your boss called this morning and asked me how my arm was.
C: JOHN
D: Oh?
E: CAUGHT
C: LORI
D: Yeah. Because of the dog fight I tried to break up.
C: JOHN
D: Ohh...
C: LORI
D: If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that was some bullshit lie you made up so you could take off work and go to Ted's. Am I right?
C: JOHN
D: I... I made you out to be a hero.
E: BEAT
C: LORI
D: John, Ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him. You're not really giving anything a chance if you're blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear.
C: JOHN
D: It won't happen again, I promise.
C: LORI
D: Yes. It will.
E: with a bit of anger
N: A beat. She sighs.
C: LORI
D: I wanna break up.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: W... What?
E: THROWN
C: LORI
D: I'm just... I'm done. This isn't gonna work. We're in two different places.
C: JOHN
D: Lori, look, I know--
C: LORI
D: You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did that for you-- for us! And it wasn't easy.
C: LORI
D: Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me.
C: JOHN
D: Okay, look. I've been getting stoned too much. I know that. I've been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance.
C: LORI
D: I need a man, John. Not a boy with a teddy bear.
E: BEAT
C: JOHN
D: I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart.
N: Lori can't help but let a small laugh escape. She softens a bit...
C: LORI
D: John... this really is your last chance. I can't do this anymore.
C: JOHN
D: You won't have to. Trust me. I love you.
N: He kisses her.
C: LORI
D: Okay.
E: BEAT
C: JOHN
D: Aw, sweetie, I love you so much! You won't be sorry, I swear.
N: She smiles at him, then:
C: LORI
D: Did you really just fart?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my hand.
C: LORI
D: Oh. Wonder where it'll hit first.
N: WIDER ANGLE on the restaurant. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a couple other men and women) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions.
C: GUY AT TABLE
D: Who did this to us?!

N: Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at Ellen's register.
C: FRANK
D: What the hell?
N: He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and notices him.
C: GUY IN LINE
D: Hey, dude, you think you could open more than one register? There's like a thousand people here!
C: FRANK
D: There's supposed to be three registers open, for god's sake!
N: He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's counter and produce area, then walk into the back storeroom.
S: INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away, with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock and horror.
S: INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER
N: Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted.
C: FRANK
D: You had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public.
C: TED
D: Yes.
C: FRANK
D: That took guts. We need guts. I'm promoting you.
E: BEAT
C: TED
D: Oh.
S: EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:
C: TED
D: Kareem!
N: The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.
C: TED
D: You suck, Kareem. We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and looks around. There appears to be no one in the darkness.
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D
N: No answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb.
C: DONNY
D: Hello, Ted.
C: TED
D: Gah! Uh... hi there.
C: DONNY
D: Are you all alone out here?
C: TED
D: Uh... no. No I'm not. I'm... you know, you're never alone when you're with Christ.
C: DONNY
D: You know, Robert and I could give you a very, very good home.
C: TED
D: I'm... I'm pretty happy where I am. I just got a shitty new apartment--
C: DONNY
D: I can offer you six thousand dollars in railroad bonds. They were left to me by my father.
C: TED
D: Well, gosh, you know, since I just returned from active duty in the Civil War, that sounds really appealing. Oh wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty years ago, and I don't give a shit.
N: Tami-Lynn approaches.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: Teddy, come on-- we're gonna have pop tarts and cigarettes with my mom before she goes to work.
C: TED
D: Yeah, I'm comin', sweetheart. Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so I'm gonna have to decline.
E: TO DONNY
C: DONNY
D: I really wish you wouldn't...
C: TED
D: Yeah, sorry. But, ah... you know, I'd like to thank you for creepin' up my night, and... Jesus be with you. In Christ.
N: Ted hurries off. ANGLE ON DONNY, who looks eerily determined.
S: EXT./ ESTAB. REX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: John and Lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house in Cambridge. It's a very impressive estate with no expense spared.
C: LORI
D: I'm glad you're here.
E: smiling at him warmly
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your boss' ass? That won't affect your workplace chemistry, will it?
C: LORI
D: Play nice. Please. Rex throws open the door.
C: REX
D: There she is! I was worried you weren't coming! Hi kiddo, how ya doin'? Where's your bunny rabbit?

D: He's a bear.
C: REX
D: Got it. "Hey, this house is fucking huge!" I know guys, try not to get lost.
E: ushering them in
S: INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The party is a very costly-looking event: uniformed servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors d'ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and hundreds of guests. A large banner reads "Happy 20th Anniversary, Plymouth Public Relations."
C: REX
D: Oh, here come the ladies.
N: Gina, Michelle, and Tracy approach. Everyone adlibs their hellos to John and Lori. A waiter walks by with a tray of champagne. Lori and the girls each take a glass.
C: REX
D: Say listen, why don't John and I give you gals a chance to talk tampax while we go grab a drink at the bar, huh?
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: Sure.
S: INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - STAIRS AND UPSTAIRS
N: Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.
C: REX
D: ...and that's a Wade Boggs autographed bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for that at auction.
C: JOHN
D: Wow, cool.
C: REX
D: Yeah, cool. And those boxing gloves were worn by Joe Louis in his first fight. (passing an abstract
C: PAINTING)
D: This is art. Do you get it? ) These were John Lennon's glasses. Worth about two million dollars. These were John Lennon's glasses. Worth about two million dollars. ) That's me and Tom Skerritt. Oh, and check this out.

D: No.
E: TOUCHING IT
C: REX
D: That's Lance Armstrong's nut.
N: John quickly pulls his hand away.
C: REX
D: Something, isn't it? Had it freeze-dried and bronzed.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: REX
D: Every now and then, when I feel like my life's gettin' me down and things are tough, I just come in here and look at it, and it reminds me that things aren't so bad. That some people have it worse than me. I mean, he's only got one ball, and I have three. One of them, of course, being his.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: That's inspiring. You've led a rich life.
C: REX
D: I've fucked the shit outta life. So talk to me, Goose. How are things with you and Lori?
E: THEN
C: JOHN
D: Things are great, actually.
C: REX
D: That's good, that's good.
C: JOHN
D: You know... Lori would hate me for saying this, but... she's told me how you are at the office, and... as one gentleman to another, I just wanna say I really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease.
C: REX
D: Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta just clear the air here a little. I... just want you to know that... I mean, yeah, I'm kind of a "fun-time boss" and whatnot, but... look man, I do that with everybody at the office! I'm just a kook! I have no designs on your girlfriend. We work together, and that's it. I think you're a great guy and she's very lucky.
N: John is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear this.
C: JOHN
D: Well... that's good to hear.
C: REX
D: Well, that's how it is, so...there we go.
C: JOHN
D: Okay.
C: REX
D: Yeah.
N: They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's nut. John's phone rings the "Knight Rider" theme. John answers it.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, Ted.
N: INTERCUT PERIODICALLY BETWEEN JOHN AND TED, who stands in the foreground with one finger in his ear. In the background, we see a party in full swing.
C: TED
D: Johnny! You gotta get over here, man!
E: V.O.
C: JOHN
D: Why? What's going on?
C: TED
D: I'm havin' a little impromptu thing with some people, and John... Sam Jones is here.

D: Just like in the movie.
E: EQUALLY SOFTLY
C: TED
D: Get over here.
C: JOHN
D: Fuck! I can't... I'm with Lori. I'm already on probation here.
N: John looks down at the main area of the party, and sees Lori happily chatting with her co-workers.
C: JOHN
D: I just... I can't.
E: CONT'D AGONIZED
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
C: TED
D: John. There are moments in a man's life: Nathan Hale, "I regret that I have but one life to give for my country." Alan Hale, "Yes, I accept the role of the Skipper on `Gilligan's Island.'"
S: INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
C: TED
D: John, this is your Alan Hale moment. For god's sake, come share this with me.
E: V.O.
C: JOHN
D: I'm coming.
E: beat, then:
N: John hangs up.
C: JOHN
D: Rex. I gotta go. I'll be back in thirty minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out. She absolutely cannot know I was gone. If you can cover for me... we're cool on all that other stuff.
E: CONT'D
C: REX
D: I got your back, my friend. Been there. She'll never know.
C: JOHN
D: This is one man to another. I don't really know you, but I'm trusting you. As a man. This is serious. Can I trust you?
C: REX
D: Dude. One man to another. I got you on this.
C: JOHN
D: Okay. Thank you.
E: RELAXING SOMEWHAT
N: John races O.S.... and Rex raises his scotch glass to his mouth.
C: REX
D: I'm gonna make traditional to your girlfriend. And then fuck her in the ass. All right. We have a game plan.
E: SMILING
S: EXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The "Football Fight" music from "Flash Gordon" starts playing, as John bolts O.S.
S: EXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: John sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway. He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts the car, and backs out.
S: EXT. BOSTON (VARIOUS) - NIGHT
N: CUT TO various shots of John racing through the city on his way to Ted's. Finally, he pulls up to Ted's apartment.
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: John throws open the door. The place is as lively as it can be. The party is packed with people, including Alix and Tanya, John's co-workers from Liberty. There are also a large number of booze-swilling guys and hot chicks. Ted runs up, wearing a blazer.
C: TED
D: Johnny! Thank Christ you made it!
C: JOHN
D: I got ten minutes, where's Flash Gordon?
E: QUICKLY
C: TED
D: Okay, get ready, man. Hey, Sam! This is the guy I was tellin' you about!
E: to someone O.S.
N: John turns to look in the direction Ted is indicating. The shot slows down into slo-mo as John's eyes widen, and he sees... OPPOSITE ANGLE - Across the room, SAM J. JONES turns in slo-mo to face John. He is inexplicably still sporting the same hairstyle he had in the "Flash Gordon" movie. We hear the theme from "Flash Gordon." We INTERCUT back and forth from him to John: ON JOHN - He stands frozen in awe. ON SAM - He smiles as he begins to walk toward the camera, in John's POV. ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe. ON SAM - Still slowly walking toward camera in John's POV, but he is now dressed in the Flash Gordon costume. ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.
S: EXT. MONGO SKY - DAY - FANTASY
N: Sam J. Jones flies on the flying Jetski from the movie. John stands behind him on the back, with his arms around Sam's chest, as if on the back seat of a motorcycle. John has a huge, elated smile on his face.
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - BACK TO SCENE
N: ON John - He still stares in awe. ON SAM - He smiles and offers an outstretched hand for a handshake. BACK TO NORMAL SPEED - Sam walks up to John with Ted by his side.
C: TED

C: SAM
D: Hi there. Good to meet you.
C: JOHN

E: in absolute fucking awe
C: SAM
D: You're welcome. Hey, let's do some shots, huh?
C: JOHN
D: With you? Yes. Oh my god, yes.
N: Sam passes out shots of Southern Comfort.
C: SAM
D: Death to Ming! John and Ted look at each other, squealing with delight. Everyone then does their shots.
E: raising his glass
C: SAM
D: Hey, you guys seem pretty cool. You like to party?
E: CONT'D SIGNIFICANTLY
N: John and Ted don't answer for a beat. They look at each other nervously. It's clear neither one has any experience with this sort of thing.
C: SAM
D: Aw, come on dudes. Don't tell me you've never done it before.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Not... recently, no.
E: a little scared
C: SAM
D: You fellas better come with me.
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - SHORTLY AFTER
N: John, Ted, and Sam emerge from the bathroom. John's eyes are wide and enthusiastic. Ted has a little bit of powder on his nose, and his ears are flattened back. And Sam is just playing it cool.
C: TED
D: Wow.
C: SAM
D: Let's party like the `80's huh?
C: TED
D: Show us how, Flash.
E: REVERENTIAL

S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: John and Ted sit staring at each other intensely across the table.

D: Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
C: JOHN
D: But why even bring that up--

D: You don't bring it up. You just let `em in.
C: JOHN
D: Yeah, but why mention it?

S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - SAME
N: Ted stands opposite a group of party guests who sit on the couch. He holds a knife.
C: TED
D: No see, I can do this.
N: GUY #1 Shut up.
C: TED
D: My teddy bear biology gives me superhuman reflexes.
N: GUY #2 Let him try it, man. GUY #1 Fuck it, all right. Guy #1 puts his hand down on the coffee table and Ted starts doing the knife trick from "Aliens". He gets it right for a few seconds, then stabs the guy right through the hand. The guy screams in pain.
C: TED
D: Well, you never shoulda trusted me, I'm on drugs!
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: John stands with a pair of fake bear ears on his head, doing an impression of Ted as a small group of partygoers (Ted included) watches, laughing hysterically.
C: JOHN
D: Hey Johnny, I just had a great idea-- let's go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass!
E: AS TED
C: TED
D: Oh god, that was a fun day.
C: JOHN
D: Johnny, you gotta get over here man, I just tried this DMT all the kids are talkin' about, and I'm in trouble! I think I got sucked inside my chair!
E: AS TED
C: TED
D: I do not sound that much like Peter Griffin.
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Ted sits on the couch drawing a pair of Garfield eyes on a topless girl. Below the eyes he has drawn the muzzle and the mouth, and above them the ears.
C: TED
D: See? There. Proof. Garfield's eyes look like a pair of tits.
C: TAMI-LYNN
D: Okay, you were right.
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Ted stands by the TV, singing a karaoke version of "I Only Want to be with You" by Hootie and the Blowfish.
C: TED
D: Okay, Johnny, c'mon up here and do this with me!
C: JOHN
D: No no.
C: TED
D: Come on!

WELL THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU. YOU LOOK AT ME YOU'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO SAY. I'LL ONLY POUT AT YOU UNTIL I GET MY WAY. I WON'T DANCE. YOU WON'T SING. I JUST WANT TO LOVE YOU BUT YOU WANT TO WEAR MY RING. WELL THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. I ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU. YOU CAN CALL ME YOUR FOOL, I ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU.
S: INT. TED'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Sam, John and Ted stand by the wall.
C: TED
D: See there's this one part of the wall that's really soft, you could punch through it wicked easy.
N: Sam punches the wall a couple times, and his fist goes right through.
C: SAM/TED/JOHN
D: Holy shit! / Ha! / Wow! / Etc.
N: Immediately we see half an Asian face dart into frame through the hole. He screams in Cantonese, then,
C: ASIAN MAN
D: What the hell you problem!! You break my wall! You break my wall I break you wall!
N: The neighbor sticks a knife through the hole. John, Ted, and Sam scream. Sam and John jump around and scream as they frantically try to get the knife.
C: JOHN
D: AAA! AAA!! Break his arm, Flash! Cut his arm off!!
N: Sam grabs the arm, and it darts back inside.
S: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: There's an angry pounding on the door. One of the party guests opens it, and the Asian guy runs in, screaming in Cantonese. He holds a wooden spoon in one hand, and a live duck in the other. John, Sam, and Ted run back out into the living room. The Asian guy runs toward them, screaming first in Cantonese, then:
C: ASIAN MAN
D: You break my wall! This my home long time! You break my wall! You bastard men!
C: JOHN/TED
D: Dude, we're sorry! We're sorry!
C: ASIAN MAN
D: You bastard men! I try to make duck dinner, now plaster everywhere!

D: My name Wan Ming.
E: CAUTIOUSLY
C: FLASH
D: Ming!
E: NARROWING EYES
N: SAM'S POV - We see the Asian man dressed as Ming the Merciless.
C: ASIAN MAN
D: You pay many dollar for wall! This bullshit! This all bullshit!
C: SAM
D: DEATH TO MING!!!
N: Sam charges the Asian man, tackling him. They both tumble over the back of the couch, nearly knocking it over. The duck flies out of his arms, landing on the floor. It immediately goes after Ted, who screams. ANGLE ON SAM, who chokes the Asian man on the floor. John struggles to pull him off.
C: JOHN
D: Sam, no! Get off him!
N: ANGLE ON TED - who circles confrontationally with the duck, as in an Irish bar fight. ANGLE BACK ON THE GUYS FIGHTING - The Asian man jabs Sam in the eye with the other end of the spoon, and Sam goes staggering backward, falling into John. They land on the table, smashing it in half. They fall to the floor on top of each other.
C: ASIAN MAN
D: You crazy! You crazy man!
N: The duck charges at Ted and slaps him across the face a few times with its wings.
C: TED AAA! AAAA! OW!!
D: The Asian man calls to the duck from the door.
C: ASIAN MAN
D: Come on, James Franco!
N: The duck takes one last whack at Ted and waddles over to the Asian man, fluttering up into his arms.
C: ASIAN MAN
D: You pay for wall!

C: JOHN
D: What??
C: GUY
D: Yeah. Turns out I'm gay or whatever. Had no idea. C'mon Jared, let's get a drink.
N: He and Jared walk off. ANGLE ON JOHN, who sits on the couch, looking zoned out and drained. Sam Jones approaches.
C: SAM
D: How you doin' there, ace? You comin' down?
C: JOHN
D: Yeah. Yeah, I don't feel good.
C: SAM
D: Give it a couple hours, you'll be golden, Pony Boy. Want a Xanax?
N: John looks at the clock. His eyes widen in panicked realization.
C: JOHN
D: Holy shit. Holy shit, oh my god!
C: SAM
D: What?
C: JOHN
D: I gotta-- I gotta go! Shit!
N: John scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door.
S: INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
N: John opens the door and runs down the hall. He runs partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs. They stare at each other for a beat. She looks as hurt, angry, and betrayed as a woman can be.
C: JOHN
D: Lori... I...
N: He throws up all over the floor.
S: EXT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Lori storms out into the street. After a beat, John runs out after her.
C: JOHN
D: Lori! Lori wait!
N: She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.
C: JOHN
D: I'm sorry! I messed up! I--
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: I want you out of the apartment... tonight. Gimme my car keys.
C: JOHN
D: Can I please just explain--

C: LORI
D: I have given up a big chunk of my life for you.
C: JOHN
D: I was gonna stop in for like five minutes, and then Flash Gordon--
C: LORI
D: Just give me my keys, John!
N: He reluctantly hands her her keys. She turns and walks toward her car.
C: JOHN
D: Lori... please. I love you.
N: She gets in the car and drives away with a screech. Angle on Ted, who is walking out the door.
C: TED
D: Johnny, come on upstairs. Tami-Lynn's gonna make some RC Cola from scratch.
C: JOHN
D: Fuck you! I don't want to talk to you!
C: TED
D: What?
C: JOHN
D: Do you know what just happened? Do you have any clue? My life just ended.
C: TED
D: Oh come on, she'll go home, watch Bridget Jones' Somethin' Asshole, cry a little bit, she'll be fine, you'll talk to her tomorrow.
C: JOHN
D: Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?!
E: EXPLODING
N: Ted pauses, realizing John is serious.
C: TED
D: Well... `course I do, Johnny. Thunder buddies for life.
C: JOHN
D: Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life.
C: TED
D: Johnny, I'm... I'm sorry.
C: JOHN
D: I just... I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can't see you anymore.
N: John turns and walks away.
C: TED
D: Johnny, wait! Hey, listen!
N: Ted pushes his own stomach in. We hear his soundbox squeak out the words "I wuv you." John does not turn around. Ted looks after him, then slowly lowers his head sadly. He sits down on the sidewalk, dazed and defeated.

N: ANGLE ON a partially full moon. PAN DOWN to John and Lori, walking along the beach, holding hands. He kisses her on the cheek, then looks down, noticing something O.S.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: ANGLE ON A BIRTHDAY CARD ON THE TABLE - We pull out to reveal Lori sitting at the table, with a couple of candles in front of her. John comes out of the kitchen wearing an apron, and holding an entire turkey with a candle in it. She smiles and puts her hands over her mouth with delighted hilarity. He sets the turkey down, and she gives him a big, laughing smile as she shakes her head.

They stand next to a soapbox car that they have built and painted.

N: 8-year-old John and Ted are at the top of a hill with the soapbox racer. Ted is in the racer, wearing a helmet. John gives the racer a push, and Ted speeds off down the hill. At the bottom, he smashes into a tree, shattering the racer, and sending him flying out of it onto the ground. A dog runs into frame, snatches Ted up, and runs off with him. John sprints after the dog.

S: EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
N: The marquee out front reads "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace." We pan down a line of moviegoers, eventually getting to 22 year-old John and Ted. John is dressed as Darth Maul, and Ted is dressed as Yoda. They excitedly wait in line.

N: John and Ted share a pizza. Ted has sauce all over his mouth and fur. John hands him a napkin and he wipes it off. Ted looks O.S., then excitedly gives John a "hang on, check this out" gesture. He runs O.S. ANGLE ON the stage, where the animal band play their instruments. Ted is there among them, stiffly playing the banjo and looking very animatronic. A couple little kids walk up to watch. After a beat, Ted gets in their faces, scaring the shit out of them. They run away, crying and traumatized. ANGLE ON John, who laughs hysterically.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: John and Lori paint the walls of their then new apartment. They start to playfully splatter paint on each other. ANGLE ON Ted, who watches from the other side of the room, where he leans against the wall. He shakes his head in a "whatever" fashion, and walks toward the door. When he turns, we see there is a white stripe of paint going down his back.
S: EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Ted exits the apartment, holding a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He pulls one cigarette out with his mouth and goes to light it. He then notices something out of the corner of his eye. He reacts with a take, and sprints O.S., dropping the cigarette and the lighter. After a beat, a skunk shuffles through frame after him.

N: Rex sits at his desk and stares out the window.
C: REX
D: So, word through the grapevine is you are newly solo. I have tickets to see Norah Jones at the Hatch Shell tonight, and I would love it if you'd go with me.
C: LORI
D: You're asking me out the day after I broke up with someone.
C: REX
D: Look, I'm gonna cut the shit here.
C: LORI
D: Okay.
C: REX
D: This is the first time you've been single in all the years you've worked here. Just go out with me one time. And if you're miserable and you hate it, I promise I will never even hint at the subject again. Please.
C: LORI
D: Rex, I don't think it's smart.
C: REX
D: Look, I'm an asshole. I know that. It worked for me in high school, and it's been like a reflex ever since.
E: MORE
C: REX
D: Lori, the worst that can happen is you have a fun, casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be something more than a jerk. Besides, you're a huge catch and it's about time somebody treated you that way.
E: CONT'D sigh
C: LORI
D: Fine... I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night.
C: REX
D: Great. Pick you up at seven?
S: EXT./ ESTAB. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT
N: It's raining outside.
S: INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - SAME
N: John sulks on the bed, leafing through a Tintin comic book. There's a knock at the door.
C: JOHN
D: Who is it?
C: TED
D: Johnny, it's me.
C: JOHN
D: Go away.
C: TED
D: Johnny, open the door, please. I wanna talk.
N: John ignores him. A few beats go by, then the window slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing on the floor, soaked.
C: JOHN
D: JESUS--
N: Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog. John flinches back, trying not to get wet.
C: JOHN
D: Jesus Christ!
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know you're pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. I saw Lori out on a date with Rex.
C: JOHN
D: What?
C: TED
D: I'm serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell.
C: JOHN
D: You're un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her--
C: TED
D: Johnny, it's the truth. I'm tellin' ya--
C: JOHN
D: Get outta here.
C: TED
D: You know, you're actin' like a cock, you know that?
E: BEAT
C: JOHN
D: What? I'm acting like a cock?
C: TED
D: Yes. You are actin' like a giant, V- shaped-funny-lookin'-guy-in-a-porno cock.
C: JOHN
D: Huh?
C: TED
D: `Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cock--forget it. What I'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself.
N: John glares at him.
C: TED
D: Lori was right about you. You can't take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Oh, and you can?
C: TED
D: I don't have to, I'm a fuckin' teddy bear! Y'know somethin', I didn't tie you up and drag you to that party. I wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, yeah? Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life?
C: TED
D: Whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't care enough about your relationship.
C: JOHN
D: You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it?
C: TED
D: Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin' your mind? That's your choice, John! And you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy.
C: JOHN
D: You know... sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old... and I wish I'd just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin.
E: BEAT
C: TED
D: Say that one more time.
E: BEAT
C: JOHN
D: Teddy... Rux-fucking-pin.
N: Ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him, wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like the facehuggers from "Aliens." John stumbles around the room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door, shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face. John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed, reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible. John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.
C: JOHN
D: AAAAAA!!! Fucking Jesus fucking Christ! god fucking dammit!!! Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat, each one breathing heavily . John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back onto the bed. Ted taunts him.
E: CONT'D Ted is now on the floor
C: TED
D: C'mon, motherfucker!
N: John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor, yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on. The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily. Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing deteriorates into sobs.
C: TED
D: Why...why are you crying?
E: CONT'D BREATHING HEAVILY
C: JOHN
D: My dick is in the TV.
N: John continues to sob. Ted climbs down off the table and up onto the bed. He pushes the TV off John, then lies down next to him. Ted starts to sob himself.
C: TED
D: I'm so sorry, Johnny. I'm so sorry.
C: JOHN
D: So am I, man.
C: TED
D: I love you.
C: JOHN
D: I love you, too.
N: John hugs Ted, who hugs him back.
C: TED
D: Listen... you gotta let me help you make things right with you and Lori.
C: JOHN
D: There is no putting things right. She hates me.
C: TED
D: No, John, we can get her back. Look, remember when you were ten, and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun, and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying? Remember? And then we ran up to it and tried to give it CPR? And it came back to life? John, we could do that again.
C: JOHN
D: Ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR. It died.
C: TED
D: We can get Lori back.
E: LONG BEAT
S: EXT. HATCH SHELL - NIGHT
N: A huge crowd has gathered for the Norah Jones concert. They cheer as she sings "Come Away With Me," backed by a large string section. ANGLE ON Rex and Lori, who cheer in the audience along with everyone else. They seem to be having a fantastic time.
C: REX
D: God, she's so brave. YOUR MUSIC IS SO
C: FUCKING BRAVE!!
D: Norah finishes the song.
C: NORAH
D: Thanks so much! We're gonna take a short break, but we'll be back in a few!
N: The crowd cheers.
S: INT. BACKSTAGE - SHORTLY AFTER
N: ANGLE ON a dressing room sign which reads NORAH JONES. We move inside the dressing room as Norah enters and pours a drink.
C: TED
D: Hey, play chopsticks, you jazzy slut!
E: O.S.
C: NORAH
D: Teddy!! How you doin', you fuzzy little asshole?
E: turning, recognizing
N: She hugs him.
C: TED
D: Well, I'm not a hot half-Muslim chick who sold 37 million records, but I'm hangin' in there.
C: NORAH
D: Well, half-Indian, but thanks.
C: TED
D: Eh, ooga booga, whatever. Hey, I want you to meet a good pal of mine. Hey Johnny, come on in!
N: ANGLE ON the doorway, where John enters, a little nervous.
C: TED
D: Norah, this is my friend John.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Hi. Hi, Norah Jones.
E: SELF-CONSCIOUSLY EXTENDS HAND
C: NORAH
D: Ha. Whoa, relax there, sweaty. You ready to bring down the house?
E: shaking his hand
C: JOHN
D: Yes ma'am. Thank you for the opportunity, Ms.-- Ma'am Jones.
C: TED
D: Jesus, you look fantastic.
C: NORAH
D: Well, you're probably not used to seeing me fully clothed.
C: TED
D: Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at Belinda Carlisle's house and we had awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom.
C: NORAH
D: Actually, you weren't so bad for a guy with no penis.
C: TED
D: I have written so many letters to Hasbro about that.
S: EXT. HATCH SHELL - SHORTLY AFTER
N: The crowd is cheering. Norah is back out on stage at the piano.
C: NORAH
D: Okay, I'm gonna give my chops a rest here and invite a friend of mine up to the stage. He's gonna sing a song to a very special lady in the audience who he loves very much. Let's give a big hand to John Bennett!
N: The crowd applauds dutifully as John walks out onstage. ANGLE ON Lori and Rex. Lori reacts, shocked.
C: LORI
D: Oh my god.
N: John takes center stage, and looks down at Lori.
C: JOHN
D: Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins. Because I love her. This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life. The night we met. It's the theme song from the movie "Octopussy."
N: The band begins playing. "All Time High". Inexplicably, Norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on.
C: JOHN
D: ALL I WANTED WAS A SWEET DISTRACTION FOR AN HOUR OR TWO / HAD NO INTENTION TO DO THE THINGS WE'VE DONE / FUNNY HOW IT ALWAYS GOES WITH LOVE, WHEN YOU DON'T LOOK, YOU FIND / BUT THEN WE'RE TWO OF A KIND / WE MOVE AS ONE
E: CONT'D
N: ANGLE ON Lori and Rex. Rex is visibly derisive, but we see that Lori is softening. It's working...
C: JOHN
D: WE'RE AN ALL-TIME HIGH / WE'LL CHANGE ALL THAT'S GONE BEFORE / DOING SO MUCH MORE / THAN FALLING IN LOVE
E: CONT'D
C: REX
D: You suck, get off the stage! Hey, come on guys!
E: fake voice, covering his mouth and looking away then, for Lori's benefit
N: The crowd starts to take the cue.
C: CROWD
D: Get off the stage! / Boooo! / You suck! / We wanna hear Norah! / Come on!
N: ANGLE ON Ted in the wings.
C: TED
D: Ah, god.
C: JOHN
D: SO HOLD ON TIGHT / LET THE FLIGHT BEGIN...
N: ANGLE ON a crazed audience member, who rushes the stage, racing toward John.
C: CRAZY GUY
D: You're an asshole!
N: John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at the last second, so the base is sticking out horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops.
C: NORAH
D: Jesus.
N: A few concert personnel rush out to check the guy.
C: STAGEHAND
D: Someone call an ambulance!
N: The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert security personnel haul him offstage.
S: EXT. HATCH SHELL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Rex escorts Lori to his car.
C: REX
D: That was insane. Did you see the way that guy's body hit the ground? It was like a rag doll!
C: LORI
D: Yeah, I'd rather just not talk about it.
C: REX
D: You want to go get a drink after this? I feel like I could use one after seeing a guy almost die.
C: LORI
D: Nope, I think I'd rather you just take me home.
C: REX
D: One drink, come on.
C: LORI
D: Nope, not really feeling up to it.
C: REX
D: Alright, alright, I get it. I don't blame you. When you think about it, it was actually really unfair of him to embarrass you like that.
C: LORI
D: Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed. Listen, John and I may have our problems but at least he tried. You know what? I don't feel like talking to you about this.
N: She walks away.
C: REX
D: Where you going?
C: LORI
D: Taking a cab. I'm going home.
N: As she disappears out of earshot, Rex closes his eyes and releases a fart.
C: REX
D: Finally.
S: EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN & LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SAME
N: Lori gets out of the shower, and begins towelling off, still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex. After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out into the hall. There's no one there.
C: TED
D: Down here, I swear to god I'm not lookin' up your towel.
E: O.S.
N: She looks down with a start, and sees Ted standing there. He's blocking his view with one hand.
C: TED
D: Not lookin' up your towel. Not lookin' at your funny business.
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: Ted? What're you doing here? What do you want?
E: pulling towel closer to her
C: TED
D: I need to talk to you.
C: LORI
D: Look, if you're here to fight John's battle for hi--
C: TED
D: Lori, do me a favor and let me talk first, and then you can say whatever you want. There's a beat. She reluctantly considers.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
N: Lori, now in a robe, sits down on the couch, facing Ted.
C: TED
D: Look, John loves you very much. More than anything in the world. And he's fallin' to fuckin' pieces without you. He knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn't all his fault. If you'll just give him one more chance to be with you--
N: She rolls her eyes.
C: TED
D: Listen to me! If you'll just give him one more chance... I promise I will leave and never come back. He'll be all yours. Just give him one more chance.
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: Ted... that's a very nice offer, but I don't want you to do that. This is about John and me and our problems. And I don't think it can be fixed.
C: TED
D: Because of me! Look, you want him to be a man. And I'm the one who's keepin' that from happening. As long as he's got his teddy bear, he's still a boy. And I care about him as much as you do. But I'm willing to give up the boy so you can have the man.
N: We can see Lori starting to soften a bit.
C: TED
D: Look, I'm givin' this the best shot I got here, Lori. I'm beggin' you. I'm no good at this emotional crap, but I gotta help my best friend. Please. Just talk to him.
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: I'll talk to him.
E: SIGH
C: TED
D: Thank you. He's waitin' for me down at Charley's. So... maybe you could, y'know... go down instead of me?
C: LORI
D: What... now?
C: TED
D: Please. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't.
C: LORI
D: Alright, alright, I'll go.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SHORTLY AFTER
N: Lori emerges from the bedroom, dressed, and heads for the door. Ted is on the couch watching TV.
C: TED
D: Hey, you mind if I stay and watch the Sox?
E: flipping on TV
N: The door shuts and she's gone. Ted gets up and walks into the kitchen. He opens the fridge.
C: TED
D: Jesus Christ, what a chick fridge. Yoplait, a cantaloupe, and a Brita water filter.
E: CONT'D
N: He opens up a crisper drawer, and looks at a six-pack of beer bottles.
C: TED
D: Michelob Ultra Tuscan Orange Grapefruit. My god, America is imploding.
E: CONT'D
N: He shakes his head as he opens the beer, and walks into the other room. He settles down in a recliner, and watches the game. After a moment, there's a knock at the door. Ted sighs with annoyance, and gets up.
C: TED
D: Forget your keys?
E: CONT'D
N: He walks to the door, and opens it up.
C: TED
D: You know, your beer suck--
E: CONT'D
N: He freezes, and looks up. We reveal Donny, the creepy man from earlier, with his son Robert.
C: DONNY
D: Hi, Ted.
C: TED
D: Fuck.
N: Donny throws a sack over Ted, trapping him.
S: EXT./ ESTAB. CHARLEY'S - LATER DAY
N: Lori's car pulls up, and she gets out.
S: INT. CHARLEY'S - CONTINUOUS
N: Lori enters, and looks around. She spots John, who looks up from a menu. He is surprised to see her. She sighs and walks over to him.
C: JOHN
D: Lori! What-- what are you doing here?
C: LORI
D: You can thank Ted.
N: A beat. John smiles slightly.
C: LORI
D: How are you?
E: CONT'D
C: JOHN
D: Good, good. I've, uh... made myself a nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up the street. I'd show you around, but it's kinda classy. They require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers.
C: LORI
D: Well. Shall I sit?
E: LAUGHS HUMORLESSLY
C: JOHN
D: Uh, yeah.
N: She does. There's a beat. A busboy brings them each a water.
C: JOHN
D: So, work's good? Everything good there?
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: Yeah. Work's fine.
C: JOHN
D: How's Rex?
C: LORI
D: There is no Rex.
C: JOHN
D: Oh. Good. Well... I guess we can't make small talk all day, so I'll say what I wanna say. I could sit here and tell you I'm sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm ready to change. But I don't think you wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not gonna try and get you to take me back. Why would you? I've been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years. I don't deserve you. I didn't take our relationship seriously, even though I love you more than life itself. All I want is... just to end on good terms. Because I owe that to you. I want you to be happy... and for us to be friends.
E: BEAT
C: LORI
D: Wow. Thank you. I appreciate that.
E: a little taken aback
C: JOHN
D: Well. That's pretty much it.
N: He takes out some money, and puts it on the table, paying the check. He smiles at her and walks out. She sits there for a beat.
S: EXT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
N: Donny's car pulls up. The house is a low-class, creepily shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in "Silence of the Lambs"). It's close to one end of the base of a bridge.
S: INT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
N: Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls, there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings, photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in public that Donny clearly took himself.
C: TED
D: Whoa...
C: DONNY
D: Yes, as you can see, you've been part of our family for quite some time. Welcome home.
C: TED
D: Heh, you know what's hilarious, I got tons of pictures of you guys at my house.
C: ROBERT
D: Daddy, is he all mine?
C: DONNY
D: He's all yours, my little winner. You've arrived at a lucky time, Ted. It's almost Robert's play hour.
C: TED
D: I'm guessin' you guys don't have a PS3. I'm guessin' you're more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family.
S: INT. ROBERT'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ted is led into Robert's room. It's a fairly sparse room with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with a wig stands in the corner.
C: TED
D: Huh. Wig horse.
N: Robert sits down on the floor, smiling at him. Donny stands in the doorway.
C: DONNY
D: Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert now. So you will do as he says.
C: TED
D: Y'know, you think you're just gonna get away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin' example you're settin' for your kid.
C: DONNY
D: (leaning in to Ted with
C: ANGER)
D: LANGUAGE!!!
N: Ted flinches nervously. Donny moves back.
C: DONNY
D: When I was a little boy, I saw you on television. And I thought you were the most amazing, most wonderful thing I'd ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father if I could have a magical teddy bear, too. And he said no. And I was heartbroken. I decided that if I ever had a son, I would never say no to him.
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn't hurt.
C: ROBERT
D: Me and Ted are gonna be best friends, daddy.
C: DONNY
D: Yes. You are. Happy play time. Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted.
C: TED
D: Jesus fucking Christ!
C: ROBERT
D: No! Daddy said no bad words!
C: TED
D: Yeah well, fuck your dad.
N: Ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it. It doesn't budge. He takes a running leap at it, but just bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor.
C: TED
D: Shit!
E: CONT'D
N: Robert stands over him.
C: ROBERT
D: I said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it.
C: TED
D: That's a great story, I felt like I was there.
C: ROBERT
D: Daddy gave me an ouch. Now I have to give you an ouch.
N: Robert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of Ted's ears with the other hand. Robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. Ted screams as loud as he can. Robert looks at him, holding the ear.
C: TED
D: Okay... okay, kid. You win. We'll do it your way. You wanna play a game or somethin'? It's play time, let's play a game.
C: ROBERT
D: Yeah, I wanna play a game!
C: TED
D: Good, good, hey, how `bout we play a little game of hide and seek?
C: ROBERT
D: I love hide and seek! I'll hide!
C: TED
D: Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right?
C: ROBERT
D: Yes.
C: TED
D: Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don't ya think?
N: There's a beat. Robert stares blankly at him, then:
C: ROBERT
D: Okay, you hide first.
C: TED
D: Great. Fantastic. Okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay?
C: ROBERT
D: Do I need to wash my hands before this game?
C: TED
D: You... well-- no, you-- god, that's a weird fuckin' question, no, just start countin'.
N: Robert sits down, covers his eyes and starts counting.
C: ROBERT
D: One... two... three...
N: Ted grabs a chair and starts sliding it over toward the door.
C: TED
D: Okay, no peekin', now, or you'll get kid cancer.
N: Ted reaches the door, climbs up onto the chair, and turns the doorknob. He opens the door, and exits out into the hallway. After a beat, he re-enters, grabs his severed ear, and exits again.
S: INT. HALLWAY - LATE DAY
N: Ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front door. He has it in sight on the far end of the living room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway, he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process, bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin, falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the direction of the hallway.

S: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY
C: DONNY
D: Ted, are you making friends with Robert?
N: Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do. After a beat, Donny leans forward as if he's about to get up.
C: DONNY
D: Ted?
E: CONT'D
C: ROBERT
D: Daddy, you're gonna ruin the game!
E: O.S.
C: DONNY
D: Okay. Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way down the hall. He passes a door. He opens it, but it's just a storage closet. He's about to shut it, but notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends. He hastily begins stapling his ear back on.
E: CHUCKLING
S: INT. DONNY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny's hears something, and turns to look. We think he's about to get up, but he then settles back in. ANGLE BACK ON TED, who puts on last staple in. Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the hall.
S: INT. DONNY'S KITCHEN - LATE DAY
N: Ted looks around, and spots a phone on the counter. He jumps up, grabs the handset, and jumps back down. He dials John's number.
S: EXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: John is walking back to the Midtown Hotel. After a beat, Lori's car pulls up slowly alongside him. She leans over.
C: LORI
D: Hey.
C: JOHN
D: Hey.
C: LORI
D: Kinda late to be walkin' home by yourself.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, I'll be okay. If I get raped, it'll be my fault with what I'm wearing.
C: LORI
D: Listen, John... there's something I wanna say to you, too.
N: He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to her. She prepares to speak, but John's phone rings. He shuts it off without looking at it.
C: JOHN
D: Go ahead.
S: INT. DONNY'S KITCHEN - LATE DAY/DUSK
N: Ted nervously holds the phone to his ear.
S: INT. LORI'S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK
C: LORI
D: John, I just want you to know that... I mean, I hope you don't think that--
N: John's phone rings. He looks down at it, annoyed. It reads "Unknown caller." He silences it.
C: LORI
D: I, um... I just feel like we should... keep talking. Because--
E: CONT'D
N: John's phone rings again. Exasperated, he answers it.
C: JOHN
D: Whoever this is, it's not a good time.
N: INTERCUT BACK & FORTH BETWEEN TED AND JOHN:
C: TED
D: John! It's me! Can you hear me?
C: JOHN
D: Ted?
N: Lori sighs, slightly annoyed.
C: JOHN
D: Listen, I gotta call you back.
E: CONT'D
C: TED
D: No, John! Don't hang up, I'm in trouble!
C: JOHN
D: What do you mean, what kinda trouble?
N: Lori turns, slightly curious, but still annoyed.
C: TED
D: They got me! That freaky guy and his freaky fat kid!
C: JOHN
D: What?
C: TED
D: I'm in their house, John! You gotta call the police, they won't let me outta here! They tore my ear off!
C: JOHN
D: Wait, slow down! Where are you?
C: TED
D: Uh... I'm not sure, it's uh--
N: Suddenly, a hand grabs the phone away from Ted. He gasps and looks up. It's Donny, who slams the phone back down in its cradle.
C: DONNY
D: You're not a very polite guest.
E: dark, brewing rage
C: TED
D: Shit.
S: INT. LORI'S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK
C: JOHN
D: Ted? Ted? Hello? Ted!
E: INTO PHONE

D: What's the matter, is he all right?
C: JOHN
D: I don't know.
C: LORI
D: Where is he?
C: JOHN
D: I don't know, but he's in trouble.
C: LORI
D: Why? What happened? Can you call him back?
C: JOHN
D: No, it's blocked-- wait a second.
N: John scrambles for his wallet. He opens it, and pulls out the address given to him earlier by Donny at the Common. He looks at it, then points out the window.
C: JOHN
D: Go! Take Columbus to Herald and get on the expressway!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Lori's car peels out and races off.
S: INT. DONNY'S KITCHEN - LATE DAY
N: Donny stands over Ted.
C: DONNY
D: You've put us in a pickle here, haven't you? We have to go now.
C: TED
D: Yeah, good idea.
N: Ted runs through Donny's legs, and out into the hall. He races for the living room and the exit, but Robert steps in front of the door, blocking him.
C: TED
D: Aaaa!
E: CONT'D
C: ROBERT
D: Found you.
N: Robert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it. Ted turns and bolts in the other direction back down the hallway, but sees Donny heading for him. Ted ducks into the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny pursues Ted around the table. Ted ducks under the table, under the chairs, etc. trying to escape Donny (and Robert, who has entered the room). Ted slips past them and back out into the hall. He races for the door, but the deadbolt is too high to reach. He runs into the living room, and pushes open a door.
S: INT. BASEMENT - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted tumbles down the dark stairs into the basement, which is lit only by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. He lands, gets his bearings, then freezes in shock, as he sees that the basement is loaded with ripped and mutilated teddy bears.
C: TED
D: AAAAAA!
N: Donny and Robert move in to frame behind him.
C: DONNY
D: We tried to make do with other teddy bears. But none of them were you, Ted.
N: Ted whirls around in shock, as we cut to:
S: EXT. STREET - DUSK
N: John and Lori race through the streets of Boston.
S: INT. LORI'S CAR - DUSK

N: Lori's car speeds away.
S: EXT. DONNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Donny and Robert emerge from the house. Donny clutches the sack. We can see it move as Ted struggles to get free. Robert gets in the back seat of the car as Donny opens the way back door, and dumps Ted inside.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted tumbles out of the sack and into the way back. Donny slams the door. He gets into the car.

C: JOHN
D: Whoa whoa, stop stop stop!
E: TO LORI
N: The car slows down, and John sees Donny's car make the turn out onto the street. Ted is looking out the back.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
C: TED
D: Johnny!
N: Robert and Donny both hear this. Donny looks in his side- view mirror, just in time to see Lori's car swing a U- turn to pursue them. Donny speeds up, and races off up the street. Lori's car speeds up in pursuit.
S: EXT. STREETS OF BOSTON - NIGHT
N: We do several quick cuts as the chase blasts its way through the Boston streets, avoiding traffic and pedestrians.
S: INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny's car races through the tunnel. Lori's car pursues.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted continues to stare out the back. He then notices a crowbar on the floor in the way back. He grabs it, and takes a hard swing at the rear window. It does not break. Robert sees this, and scrambles to undo his seat belt.
S: INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
C: JOHN
D: Come on, we're losing him!
N: Lori speeds up.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted takes another swing at the window. The glass does not break. Robert undoes his seat belt, and scrambles back. He grabs Ted, who drops the crowbar. He starts to pull Ted back over into the back seat, but Ted manages to wriggle free.
S: INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: The chase continues.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted grabs the crowbar, and again takes a swing at the window. This time, it shatters. He drops the crowbar, and climbs up onto the edge of the window.
S: INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: They see Ted in the window.
C: JOHN
D: Get closer!
C: LORI
D: I'm trying!
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted gets one leg and one arm up onto the edge of the window, when suddenly he is whacked hard in the side of the head, sending him tumbling onto the floor. We see that Robert has struck him hard with the crowbar.
C: TED
D: Aaaaa! Shit!!
E: holding head in pain
S: INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: They continue watch with held breath, as they keep up.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted shakes himself off, still a little dazed, and climbs back up. Robert climbs into the way back and grabs one of his legs.
C: ROBERT
D: No! You're being bad!
N: Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and brandishes it threateningly at Robert.
C: TED
D: Back off, Susan Boyle.
N: Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump.
S: INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
C: JOHN
D: Easy...
C: LORI
D: I know.
C: JOHN
D: EASY--
C: LORI
D: I know!
S: INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Lori's car moves closer to Donny's. There's a tense moment with some back and forth cutting... and then Ted makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori breathe energetic sighs of relief.
C: TED
D: Johnny! Total T.J. Hooker, right?
N: John and Lori laugh.
C: JOHN
D: Yes! Fuckin' A right!
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny sees what's happening in his side mirror. He puts his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back) and tumbling into the back seat.
C: TED
D: God dammit!
N: Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack. ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off.
S: INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny's car scrapes against the side of the tunnel, sending sparks flying.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the floor on the passengers' side. Donny rips the sack off his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window. He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is opposing traffic moving in the other direction.
S: EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.
C: LORI
D: Shit!
N: She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they continue on into the city.
S: EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny's car races through the streets, pursued by John and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways behind.
S: INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side. He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat. He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then, with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but can't.
S: EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
N: Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop. Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit. TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly. That little rip has done something... He shakes it off, and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and disappears inside. ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the sidewalk after them.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him down a bit. ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through the garage door, and running inside. They look around for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK ON JOHN.
C: ROBERT
D: NO!!
E: O.S.
N: John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at them!
C: ROBERT
D: You can't have my teddy bear!!
E: CONT'D
N: When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look down at him.
C: LORI
D: Oh my god.
C: JOHN
D: Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid. Come on!
E: THEN
N: John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around, but it's unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone. John continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori just behind him.
S: INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him. Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer. The chase moves past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs.
S: EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat, then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted. Ted climbs farther up the tower.
S: INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: John and Lori emerge and continue to look around frantically. They run up the walkway.
S: EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny pursues Ted up the tower.
S: EXT. LOWER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
N: John and Lori emerge into the lower seating section, and run down the aisle, looking around with desperation.

C: TOWER)
D: Look!
N: John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant lighting tower.
C: JOHN
D: Oh Jesus... Stay here.
E: THEN
C: LORI
D: Wait, John! What are you--
C: JOHN
D: STAY THERE!!
N: He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the concession area.
S: EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls back down. He's about to pulls himself up again, when Donny grabs one of his legs.
S: EXT. LOWER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
N: John continues up the aisle as fast as he can move.
S: EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he can't. CLOSE UP ON TED'S SIDE - The small rip from earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE - His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows this is not good...
S: EXT. CONCESSION AREA - CONTINUOUS
N: John reaches the top of the lower seating area, and sprints past the concession bar, heading for the stairs.
S: EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: The struggle continues. As Ted tries to pull himself free, the rip gets bigger. He reacts again, and again we see his vision swimming even more.
S: EXT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: John runs up the stairwell.
S: EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: The struggle continues. Ted tries to pull himself up, but he's visibly weakened and his hands are slipping.
S: EXT. - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: John continues up the stairwell.
S: EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: Ted manages to pull free from Donny. He uses all his depleted strength to pull himself farther up.
S: EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
N: John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over toward the lighting tower, just in time to see...
S: EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
N: Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP, Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging, stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling himself back over the ledge. We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well. ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren, and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car pull up far below, he makes a break for it. Down below, Ted's top half lies on the grass, looking around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom there is not much hope. John and Lori race to his side, and kneel down.
C: JOHN
D: Ted!
C: LORI
D: Oh my God...
C: TED
D: Johnny...
E: weak, slow breathing
N: Ted looks glassy-eyed for a beat. John starts to frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing.
C: JOHN
D: Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all!
N: Lori starts helping him, desperately grabbing chunks of the white cotton.
C: TED
D: Johnny...
N: John leans back over Ted.
C: JOHN
D: You're gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You're gonna be fine.
C: TED
D: Jesus, I look like the robot from "Aliens".
E: WEAK
C: JOHN
D: No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're gonna be okay.
C: TED
D: I... I don't think so. I'm... I'm in trouble. I need... I need to tell you something.
C: JOHN
D: What is it?
C: TED
D: Don't... don't ever lose her again. She's the most important... most important part of your life.
E: MORE
C: TED
D: Even more than me. She's your thunder buddy now. She's--
E: CONT'D
N: Ted closes his eyes... and dies. ANGLE DIRECTLY ABOVE TED as we pull away, and it starts to rain...
S: EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The rain is pouring now. Lori's car pulls up. She and John hurry out, John holding the remains of Ted. They race inside.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: John and Lori burst in with the remains of Ted. They're both drenched from the rain. Lori frantically searches drawers for sewing materials. She finds a needle and thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to sew him up as John watches intently.
C: LORI
D: John... I don't know if this is gonna--
C: JOHN
D: Just try. Please. Just try.
N: She continues sewing, until she is all finished. They wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower their heads.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER
N: John sits on the couch, head in hands. Ted still lies on the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his shoulder.
C: LORI
D: John... I'm sorry. You did everything you could. I'm... I'm just so sorry.
N: She gently puts an arm around him. There is a thunderclap outside. John does not react.
C: LORI
D: (almost too softly to be
E: CONT'D
C: HEARD)
D: You're not afraid...
N: ANGLE ON TED (shortly after) as a white sofa blanket is placed over him. John and Lori shut off the lights, and exit...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: John is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying awake. She sighs restlessly, and gets up. She walks over to the window, and looks out.
S: EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME
N: ANGLE UPWARD - We see a cloudy sky, much like the one from that night when John was a child. As before, there is a small clear patch in the center. A shooting star whizzes by through the opening.
S: INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Lori's eyes widen a bit in recognition. She stares at the shooting star for a beat, then closes her eyes and makes a wish...
S: EXT./ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - TIME LAPSE INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: John wakes up, looks around groggily, then remembers. He gets out of bed, and walks toward the living room.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: He pauses for a beat... and walks in. The blanket is where it was left. John slowly removes it. Ted is still motionless. John lowers his head sadly. Suddenly, Ted's eyes snap open.
C: JOHN
D: Ted!

TIME CUT to shortly after, as Sam Jones addresses the two of them, standing at the altar.

S: EXT. OLD BOSTON CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
N: John and Lori come running out of the church, as the crowd throws rice at them. They run to a waiting limo with a "Just Married" sign on the back. John gets in, and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina, Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...
