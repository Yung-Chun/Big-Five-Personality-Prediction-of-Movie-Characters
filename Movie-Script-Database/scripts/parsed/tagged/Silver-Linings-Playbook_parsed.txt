C: PAT
D: What are you doing, Dad? You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior.

C: PAT
D: Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.

C: DR. PATEL
D: Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one.
C: PAT
D: Let me say something, I gotta say something.
C: DR. PATEL
D: Okay.
C: PAT
D: This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.

N: TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS.
S: INT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY
C: DR. PATEL
D: You seemed to have trouble last night.
C: PAT
D: Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....
C: DR. PATEL
D: He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.
C: PAT
D: Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
C: DR. PATEL
D: Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.
C: PAT
D: Yeah, but that's easier said than done.
C: DR. PATEL
D: You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.
C: PAT
D: Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?
C: DR. PATEL
D: No.
C: PAT
D: Why?
C: DR. PATEL
D: Because you have a restraining order.
N: PAT (SIGHS) What good are you, man?
C: DR. PATEL
D: Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night?
C: PAT
D: Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?
C: DR. PATEL
D: Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?
C: PAT
D: Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
C: DR. PATEL
D: Why is she a slut?
C: PAT
D: After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
C: DR. PATEL
D: Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.
C: PAT
D: She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?
C: DR. PATEL
D: Can you?
C: PAT
D: Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?
C: DR. PATEL
D: Yes.
C: PAT
D: With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
C: DR. PATEL
D: Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.
C: PAT
D: No, not the books.
C: DR. PATEL
D: You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.

N: SHE EATS CEREAL. TIFFANY (CHEWING) Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
C: PAT

N: TIFFANY (CHEWING) It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.
C: PAT
D: It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?
C: TIFFANY
D: It's good. How's your restraining order?
C: PAT
D: I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.
C: TIFFANY
D: And the so-called incident with the weights.
C: PAT
D: Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.
N: TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT.
C: TIFFANY
D: I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.
N: PAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING.
C: PAT
D: It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
C: TIFFANY
D: I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
C: PAT
D: But you would do it?
C: TIFFANY
D: I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.
C: PAT
D: How did you lose your job?
C: TIFFANY
D: By...having sex with everybody in the office.
C: PAT
D: Everybody?
C: TIFFANY
D: I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.
C: PAT
D: We don't have to talk about it.

C: TIFFANY

C: TIFFANY
D: Hot.
C: PAT
D: Jesus Christ. Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants to
N: SEDUCE YOU--
C: TIFFANY
D: Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.
C: PAT
D: What? You sat on her lap?
C: TIFFANY
D: Mm-hmm.
C: PAT
D: She told you what to do?
C: TIFFANY
D: Mm-hmm.
C: PAT
D: Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.
C: TIFFANY
D: I don't mind it.
C: PAT
D: You don't, do you.
C: TIFFANY
D: No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.
C: PAT
D: I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...
C: TIFFANY
D: I heard about that.
C: PAT
D: ...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.
C: TIFFANY
D: Wow.
C: PAT
D: Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
C: TIFFANY
D: Yeah.
C: PAT
D: So I know.
C: TIFFANY
D: You do.
C: PAT
D: I just gotta get a strategy, you know?
C: TIFFANY
D: Me too.
C: PAT
D: We'd better get back to the letter.
C: TIFFANY
D: Yeah, let's get back to the letter.
C: PAT
D: What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?
C: TIFFANY
D: Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.

D: It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. Tiffany listens.

C: OFFICER KEOGH
D: I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief". And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore.
N: DANNY STANDS UP.

E: CONT'D

C: TIFFANY
D: Are you fucking kidding me?
C: PAT
D: I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something?
C: TIFFANY
D: A deal is a deal.
C: PAT
D: I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.
C: TIFFANY
D: Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk.
C: PAT
D: I'm not doing it.
C: TIFFANY
D: Only walk. Do it.
C: PAT
D: No. That's stupid.

E: CONT'D
C: PAT
D: I don't feel anything.
C: TIFFANY
D: Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
C: PAT
D: No.
C: TIFFANY
D: We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. That's a feeling.

E: CONT'D
C: PAT
D: I didn't realize that.
C: PAT SR.
D: Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in.

C: PAT
D: Right.
C: PAT SR.
D: Hmm?
N: PAT SR. LOOKS AWAY.
C: PAT SR.
D: I just wanted to, maybe I didn't, spend enough time with you growing up. I spent too much time with your brother. It might have made you feel worse about your behavior, but I didn't know anything, I didn't know how to handle it. I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about. It's about us, spending time now. I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet. That's the whole point. Yeah. I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things. So would you, would you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now?

C: PAT
D: He's not embarrassed?
C: PAT SR.
D: No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. `Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.
C: RANDY
D: Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
C: PAT SR.
D: Randy. I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor. We all stick together on this. That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe.
E: to Pat
C: PAT
D: I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.

C: PAT
D: Why?
C: TIFFANY
D: These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.
C: PAT
D: I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.
C: TIFFANY
D: Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
C: PAT
D: No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.

C: TIFFANY
D: I thought you were gonna read it out loud.
E: CONT'D
C: PAT
D: Okay. Sorry.
N: (READING) (MORE)
C: PAT
D: "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.
E: CONT'D
C: PAT
D: I think I'm done for today, okay?
E: CONT'D
C: TIFFANY
D: She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.

N: I--
C: PAT SR.

C: TIFFANY
D: Oh, really?
C: PAT
D: Yes.
C: PAT
D: I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--
E: CONT'D
C: TIFFANY
D: Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.
C: PAT SR.
D: What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?
C: PAT
D: There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation!
C: PAT SR.
D: She's fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here.
C: TIFFANY
D: You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?
C: PAT SR.
D: Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since--
N: TIFFANY (INTERRUPTING) You think that I'm why today's happened?
C: PAT SR.
D: That's right, you are why today happened.
C: TIFFANY
D: I'm the reason why today happened?
C: PAT SR.
D: I think so.
C: TIFFANY
D: Let's talk about that.
C: PAT SR.
D: Be my guest.
C: TIFFANY
D: The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.
C: JAKE
D: She's right, Dad.
C: TIFFANY
D: The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.
C: PAT
D: Wow.
C: TIFFANY
D: The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
C: PAT
D: Oh, wow.
C: PAT SR.
D: Let me think about that. Wait a minute.
C: TIFFANY
D: Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.
C: PAT SR.
D: He was with you?
C: TIFFANY
D: He was with me. We went for a run.
C: RONNIE
D: Really? That's crazy.
C: TIFFANY
D: There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
C: JAKE
D: She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts.
C: TIFFANY
D: Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."
E: to Pat Sr.
C: DOLORES
D: Oh Pat.
C: TIFFANY
D: Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
C: RONNIE
D: Unbelievable.
C: PAT
D: Wow. How did you know all that stuff?
C: TIFFANY
D: I did my research.
N: SHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS.
C: PAT SR.
D: Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
C: TIFFANY
D: Thank you.
C: PAT SR.
D: I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do.
C: PAT
D: Oh, now you like her, Dad?
C: PAT SR.
D: I have to say I do. Yup.
C: RANDY
D: Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.
C: TIFFANY
D: Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.
C: PAT
D: Is that right?
C: TIFFANY
D: You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!
C: RANDY
D: That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!
C: TIFFANY
D: You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it.
C: PAT SR.
D: Yeah, prove it, prove it!
C: RANDY
D: How do you want me to prove it?
C: PAT SR.
D: How's he gonna prove it?
C: TIFFANY
D: By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.
C: PAT
D: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
C: RANDY
D: Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying?
C: TIFFANY
D: No.
N: She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.
C: TIFFANY
D: Against the Cowboys.
E: CONT'D
N: EVERYONE GASPS.
C: TIFFANY
D: That's your team isn't it, Randy?
E: CONT'D
C: PAT
D: That's his team!
C: TIFFANY
D: I know who his team is.
C: RANDY
D: When is the game?
C: TIFFANY
D: December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
C: PAT
D: Oh, my God.
C: TIFFANY
D: Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.
C: DOLORES
D: Oh God.
C: PAT SR.
D: Randy, I thought they were America's Team. Don't you believe in America's Team?
C: TIFFANY
D: Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?
C: RANDY
D: Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
C: PAT SR.
D: I like it.
C: DOLORES
D: No. No, Patrizio--
C: PAT SR.
D: I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I'll take the action. I'll take it.
C: PAT
D: Dad!
C: DOLORES
D: Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!
C: PAT SR.
D: I have faith, I have faith. Excelsior belongs in this house--
N: PAT DAD--
C: PAT SR.
D: --not in the State of New York. In this house.
C: PAT
D: Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay?
C: PAT SR.
D: I didn't know, either, but now I know.
C: PAT
D: I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing--
C: PAT SR.
D: Randy, what do you say-- Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough. Randy, what do you say? My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points. I'll give you three more.
E: to Pat to Randy
C: DOLORES
D: Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet!
C: PAT SR.
D: In fact, I'll give you ten points.
C: PAT
D: No, Dad! Dad!
C: JAKE
D: Dad!
C: PAT SR.
D: You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.
C: RANDY
D: Dolores, would you stop him?
C: JAKE
D: Jesus!
C: PAT SR.
D: How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. What's that? Tiffany, what's that?
E: to Tiffany
C: PAT
D: What? No, no, no, no.
C: RANDY
D: You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.
C: DOLORES
D: What? No parlay! No!
C: PAT
D: No, don't do it. Don't do it.
C: RANDY
D: Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything?
C: PAT
D: I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high- end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't--
C: TIFFANY
D: They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.
C: RANDY
D: Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?
C: PAT
D: We suck.
C: TIFFANY
D: We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.
C: RANDY
D: And how are the people you're competing against?
C: TIFFANY
D: They're good. Some of them are professionals.
C: RANDY
D: They're good? Better than you? Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
C: PAT
D: A lot better.
C: RANDY
D: A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?
C: PAT
D: No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away--
C: TIFFANY
D: Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!
C: PAT
D: We can't get five!
C: PAT SR.
D: Give `em a five. Give `em a five.
C: TIFFANY
D: We can do a five.
C: PAT
D: What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance!
C: RANDY
D: That's the parlay.
C: DR. PATEL
D: Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?
C: RONNIE
D: You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.
C: DR. PATEL
D: That's very, very manic indeed.
C: RONNIE
D: That's the parlay.
C: RANDY
D: Shake on it.
C: PAT
D: You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. Randy, Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.
E: to Randy
C: TIFFANY
D: Pat, you can't quit.
C: PAT
D: I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

D: See you later.

D: Pat, no.

D: Pat.
N: PAT (WALKING OUT) I'm out. PAT SR. (FOLLOWS HIM) Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go.
C: PAT
D: What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.
C: TIFFANY
D: You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the
N: SIGNS--

C: TIFFANY
D: There's no other way.
C: PAT SR.
D: You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.
C: DOLORES
D: No. I don't approve. You can't do it.
C: PAT SR.
D: Well, you know, I didn't approve when you called her and you told her where he was running, so she could ambush him. I didn't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this anyway. That's it.
C: TIFFANY
D: We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.
N: PAT SR. (TO DOLORES) You gotta be part of it.
