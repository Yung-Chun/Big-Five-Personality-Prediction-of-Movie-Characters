S: INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1
N: In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry. GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his seventies.
C: OLD MATLIN
D: Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely.
N: Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.
C: OLD MATLIN
D: I haven't talked about it for years, you know? Everyone called me crazy...
E: looks at the camera
N: Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.
C: OLD MATLIN
D: But I have the negative.
N: Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, dramatic effect.
C: TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
D: Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape.
C: OLD MATLIN
D: It all started back in Â´44. I was a Corps photographer aboard an allied submarine...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges. 35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.
C: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
D: ...off the coast of Scotland. Classified mission. I was 21...
N: SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform soaked in sweat.
C: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
D: We had an English civilian on board. Not much older than me but already an advisor to President Roosevelt. "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not --
N: Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a small...
S: INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT
N: Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading" an ancient set of Tarot cards.
C: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
D: His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor --
C: WHITMAN
D: -- Broom! Topside, now.
N: TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON...
C: WHITMAN
D: The sooner we're done, the better.
N: Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much like a carpenter's tool box.
C: BROOM
D: This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
C: WHITMAN
D: Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
N: He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets. Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT CARD: THE DEVIL.
T: CUT TO:
N: OMIT
S: INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND. It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short tunnel carved into the mountain. Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside Broom.
C: BROOM
D: Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
C: WHITMAN
D: What is it?
E: impatient
C: BROOM
D: In private, if you don't mind...
S: EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS
N: They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the small box. It's full of rosaries.
C: BROOM
D: Your men -- They'll need these --
N: Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ contemplates the scene from above.
C: WHITMAN
D: You are a Catholic??
C: BROOM
D: Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
N: Whitman locks and loads an automatic.
C: WHITMAN
D: Here. You'll need one of these.
C: BROOM
D: I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
E: Whitman moves away
C: WHITMAN
D: Three days too late for that one, "professor."
N: He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has no eyes.
S: EXT. DITCH
N: MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the move. Broom catches up with Whitman.
C: WHITMAN
D: You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
C: BROOM
D: Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
C: WHITMAN
D: What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
E: interrupts him
C: BROOM
D: "Paranormal" But -- you read the transmission.
E: Whitman moves on
C: WHITMAN
D: Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
C: BROOM
D: I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
C: WHITMAN
D: Oh, I'll bet you have.
N: Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he sees lights.
C: MATLIN
D: Sweet Jesus.
N: Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS swarm among thick stone walls and archways.
C: BROOM
D: They must be here for the sheep.
N: OMIT
S: EXT. AMONG THE RUINS - NIGHT
N: A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.
C: WHITMAN
D: The freak in the gas mask --
C: BROOM
D: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
S: EXT. NEARBY - BROOM - NIGHT
N: He lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to Whitman.
C: BROOM
D: If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
C: WHITMAN
D: Air and sea backup. What's closest?
E: to the radio man
N: The RADIOMAN cranks a transmitter to life.
C: RADIO MAN
D: Londonderry, sir. Forty minutes away.
C: BROOM
D: We don't have forty minutes.
S: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
N: Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears respond! Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and signals for more floodlights to be turned on.
S: EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT
N: The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully extended.
C: GRIGORY
D: No matter what happens to me, you must carry on with the work.
N: ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.
C: ILSA
D: I will not leave you.
C: GRIGORY
D: Yes, you will... Leave me. Deny me.
C: ILSA
D: Never --
N: He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand- drawn notes and illustrations.
C: GRIGORY
D: This will guide you back to me.
N: He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.
C: GRIGORY
D: I grant you everlasting life, youth and the power to serve me.
N: He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation and a ritual. VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.
C: VON KRUPT
D: It's time.
N: OMIT
S: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT
N: Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.
C: VON KRUPT
D: Five years of research and construction, Grigory. Five years!!
N: He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella to shield her master from the pouring rain.
C: VON KRUPT
D: The furhrer doesn't look kindly on failure.
C: GRIGORY
D: There will be no failure, General. I promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll deliver one.
N: Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE. Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.
S: EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT
N: The Americans fan out, unseen. Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid a German foot patrol. Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.
S: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
N: Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind him.
C: GRIGORI
D: Tonight, We will open a portal and awaken the OGDRU JAHAD: The seven Gods of chaos. Our enemies will be destroyed. In an instant, all impurity in this world will be razed and from the ashes a new eden will arise.
E: beat
N: He looks down at the machine and whispers --
C: GRIGORY
D: Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.
N: He flexes his fingers and in response -- -- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body. Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.
C: ILSA
D: More Power!! Don't let the level drop!!
N: One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it. A blade of light opens in the air! Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.
S: EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT
N: The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light tears loose and flies in.
S: EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
N: The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin. Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another... Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.
S: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
N: Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, his face distorted by ecstasy and pain. CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.
S: EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
N: It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.
C: WHITMAN
D: Listen to me, you moron: you do that again, I'll carve you a new --
N: Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.
S: EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
N: The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with the GOLD CYLINDERS.
C: BROOM
D: (fierce whisper, to
C: WHITMAN)
D: Listen to me!!! The portal is open!!! We have to stop them!!!
S: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
N: Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy. Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall. The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!! The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the squad of Allies storms the area. A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere. VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest. Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and grabs a grenade from his belt. TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. The steel chops clean through their weapons. Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator. CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods. Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!! Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect. Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the earth right next to MATLIN.
C: ILSA
D: Grigory!
S: EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
N: Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal glove, empty and smoking. As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on. Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen. Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, nothing more. OMIT
S: EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT
N: Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.
C: MATLIN
D: It's almost over!!
C: BROOM
D: No. It's not.
N: He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.
C: BROOM
D: Cordon off the area. Something came through.
C: WHITMAN
D: From where??!!
N: Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and hell.
S: EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT
N: Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them has a rosary hanging from the bayonet. OMIT
S: EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT
N: Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.
C: MATLIN
D: Do you believe in hell?
C: BROOM
D: There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
C: MATLIN
D: Grigory -- That's Russian, right? Thought they were on our side...
E: Broom nods
C: BROOM
D: Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C: MATLIN
D: C'mon -- Rasputin??
C: BROOM
D: Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs. In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
E: beat
C: MATLIN
D: That makes him more than a hundred --
N: A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves, accompanied by a loud scrape. Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!! Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it. The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --
C: MATLIN
D: What the hell was that? An ape?
E: to Broom
C: BROOM
D: No. It was red. Bright red.
C: WHITMAN
D: What are you two talking about??
C: MATLIN
D: A red ape.
C: BROOM
D: It's-not-an-ape --
N: They hear the labored breathing of a living creature.
C: MATLIN
D: It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
C: BROOM
D: I think that is its hand.
N: Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone saint. WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom stops him from firing.
C: BROOM
D: Wait --
N: In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna. Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED THING shrinks back. Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons around it. The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the chocolate.
C: YOUNG SOLDIER
D: Jesus! would'ya look at the size of that whammer!
N: Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms. Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers snatch the candy. Broom smiles.
C: BROOM
D: It's a boy. Just a baby boy.
S: EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT
N: The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, patting him gently. CLICK!!!
C: OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
D: Best photo of my career --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DARKROOM - BACK TO INTERVIEW 1
C: OLD MATLIN
D: and no one has ever seen it. They keep saying he's not real, but I want to set the record straight before I go.
N: Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. He smiles, full of memories.
C: OLD MATLIN
D: Here. The real picture, not the retouched one in LIFE magazine. This is him. The very same night we found him. The night Broom gave him that name. Can I say it on TV? He called him --
E: hands over the photograph beat
S: EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - BACK TO '44 - NIGHT
C: BROOM
D: HELLBOY.
E: smiles at the creature
N: Inside the blanket, Hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily.
T: CUT TO:
N: HELLBOY - MAIN TITLE Montage: Tabloid covers and news clippings screaming HELLBOY SIGHTING IN RENO!! GOVERNMENT DENIAL!!! etc. TV Newscasters read lurid copy. SPRINGER excerpts (fist fight included) feature the show's theme: I WAS HELLBOY'S BRIDE!! Some blurry, grainy footage depicts Hellboy crossing an alley. Much like Bigfoot in the woods.
C: TOM MANNING
D: Look at that. That's a costume. These people amaze me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. STUDIO T.V. HOST SHOW - INTERVIEW #2 - DAY
N: MANNING is a balding, official-looking guy in a suit.
C: MANNING
D: With their conveniently blurry footage of their beloved "Hellboy." And they claim that he works for the FBI-?
N: SUPER ON TV: TOM MANNING, F.B.I. HEAD OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS. Manning on a TV SHOW a la Regis Philbin.
C: TV HOST
D: As the head of your division, you -- You have seen dozens of pictures like this!!!
C: MANNING
D: Exactly -- so, why is it that they're all out of focus? C'mon!! God knows, people manage to get good pictures at a wedding!!
N: He shows a blurry picture.
C: MANNING
D: That's the alleged best man -- ?
N: The audience applauds.
S: EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY
N: In the thick of a snowstorm, THREE FIGURES climb the icy steps of a massive rock formation. Super: BIRGAU PASS, MOLDAVIA, PRESENT DAY.
S: EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS (SET), EASTERN EUROPE - DAY
N: The THREE FIGURES move through a narrow passage until they reach a DEAD END. FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and consults Grigory's LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The symbol matches an illustration in the book. Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer, FIGURE 1 breaks through.
C: PEASANT GUIDE
D: I will guide you no further.
N: Figure 2 produces two small GOLD INGOTS. Hands one to the guide. Keeps the other one. The Guide examines his pay greedily: engraved in it: a SWASTIKA.
S: INT. ICE CAVE - SMALL CORRIDOR - DAY
N: The ice curtain collapses, revealing a rough-walled corridor. FIGURE 1 spots a glowing firefly. They follow it into --
S: INT. ICE CAVE - MAIN NAVE - DAY
N: A cathedral-like vault that could easily hold a stadium. From an opening somewhere above, eerie blue light streams down on a magnificent labyrinth. A few more fireflies speckle the air, winking on and off.
S: INT. ICE CAVE - LABYRINTH - DAY
N: The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental scale of the walkways and ramparts.
S: INT. ICE CAVE - CENTRAL LABYRINTH AREA - DAY
N: At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin. FIGURE 3 uncovers his face: he's a PEASANT GUIDE.
C: PEASANT GUIDE
D: We shouldn't be here --
E: in Romanian
N: FIGURE 1 exchanges a meaningful look with FIGURE 2. FIGURE 1 throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought, the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold. TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward. FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in his hand. The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his blade in the snow and takes back the gold. Ilsa watches the Sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin. A FIGURE RISES FROM THE BLOOD. A naked human shape, haloed by fireflies.
C: ILSA
D: Your eyes. What did they do to your eyes?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Mechanized rollers transport X-Ray films over a backlit screen. A group of 4 DOCTORS studies the pictures and exchanges somber looks. Rain spatters the windows. Doctor 1 glances at the others. DOCTOR 1 Have you told him yet? Doctor 2 looks through a glass partition at an aged but dignified BROOM, 72, who slowly buttons his shirt. Hanging from his wrist, his rosary.
S: INT. DOCTORS OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
N: DOCTOR 2 Malignant sarcoma. In the lungs... the spine, liver...
C: BROOM
D: Approximately... how long??
N: DOCTOR 2 Maybe -- six weeks. Broom impassively takes in the information. DOCTOR 2 I can arrange for hospitalization, pain management. Make the time more bearable -- Broom pensively shuffles his tarot cards.
C: BROOM
D: I'd rather... stay home, you know. I'll be making arrangements -- For my son.
E: shakes his head beat
N: DOCTOR 2 You can always get a second opinion. Broom looks down: first card off the deck: DEATH.
C: BROOM
D: That won't be necessary.
S: EXT. N.Y. - MANHATTAN STREET - DAY
N: Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN. Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the door. Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street vendor. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED, BLURRY SHAPE (HELLBOY) fills the screens.
C: BROOM
D: Son...
E: seeing this
C: TV HOST
D: Mister Manning, what about the "Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense?" The FBI has been known to conceal --
C: TOM MANNING
D: That word -- conceal --
C: TV HOST
D: from the American public --
C: TOM MANNING
D: Phil -- Phil -- hold your little green horses. Let me tell you and the American public one thing -- this "Bureau for -- what was it?
C: TV HOST
D: Paranormal Research and --
C: TOM MANNING
D: -- Defense, right, well -- I'm here to clear up this once and for all. There-is-no-such-thing.
E: he looks at the camera
N: Broom smiles. OMIT
S: EXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY
N: On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the rock below. SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK, N.J.
S: EXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY
N: A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate. Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT" A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers.
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: Yes?
C: MYERS
D: John Myers, F.B.I. Transfer from Quantico.
E: shivering
N: A beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen scanner pop out.
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: Look at the birdie, son.
N: Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers appear. CLACK! The gate opens.
S: EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY
N: The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.
S: INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY
N: Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers approaches.
C: MYERS
D: Hello, I'm --
C: LOBBY GUARD
D: -- Late. Five minutes late.
C: MYERS
D: Yes, I --
C: LOBBY GUARD
D: -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
C: MYERS
D: Pardon?
C: LOBBY GUARD
D: Two steps back, please.
N: Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND HOLDING A SWORD.
C: LOBBY GUARD
D: Watch your hands and elbows.
N: Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's on a small elevator.
S: INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY
N: The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes on.
S: INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY
N: He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving up and down in the distance.
S: INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK
N: The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the floor is a huge number: 51. Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door. Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.
S: INT. BROOMÂ´S OFFICE (FULL AQUARIUM)- DUSK
N: Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes everything in an intimate, warm light. One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to the tank.
C: VOICE
D: Turn the pages, please.
N: Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.
C: VOICE
D: Over here... if you don't mind?
N: In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.
C: MYERS
D: Jesus Christ!
N: Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering intently. Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are bubbling.
C: MYERS
D: These -- ? You're reading these -- ?
E: points at the books
N: Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.
C: BROOM
D: Four books at once. Every day -- as long as I'm here to turn the pages. My name's Broom. Professor Trevor Broom.
E: smiles
N: Myers extends his hand in greeting --
C: MYERS
D: Sir, I'm --
N: BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes his eyes -- all three lids. Abe's voice surges from the speaker.
C: ABE
D: Agent John T. Myers, Kansas City, 76. "T" stands for Thaddeus, mother's older brother. Scar on your chin happened when you were ten, you still wonder if it's ever going to fade away.
C: MYERS
D: How did it --
C: BROOM
D: -- He. Not "it."
C: BROOM
D: Abraham Sapien. Discovered alive in a secret chamber at St. Trinian's Foundling Hospital, Washington.
N: Points at a small piece of antique paper, framed on the wall.
C: BROOM
D: They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
C: MYERS
D: Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
E: reads
C: BROOM
D: The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
N: Broom uncovers a tray by the tank: Four greenish eggs. Myers gags and reels back.
C: BROOM
D: Rotten eggs, a delicacy. Abe loves them.
N: Abe smiles and takes a subaquatic bow, gracefully nabbing the eggs as they float through the hatch.
C: MYERS
D: How does he know so much about me?
C: BROOM
D: Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe. "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
E: beat
C: MYERS
D: Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
C: BROOM
D: As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
C: MYERS
D: On the desk, yes. In Latin.
C: BROOM
D: Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
C: MYERS
D: "In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
E: sighs
C: BROOM
D: "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers. We are the ones who bump back.
E: smiles
N: OMIT
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - NIGHT
N: Myers and Broom walk down a corridor. The walls are lined with glass cases containing occult artifacts. Myers eyes a MUMMIFIED HAND, a CLAY GOLEM, a sumptuous PAGAN ALTAR...
C: BROOM
D: 1937: Hitler joins "The Thule Society" -- a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.
N: He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.
C: BROOM
D: 1938: he acquires the Spear of Longinus, which pierced the body of Christ. He who holds it becomes invincible.
N: He gestures at an ancient LANCE. Next to it: a silver and gold reliquary.
C: BROOM
D: Hitler's power increases tenfold.
N: They go through a series of pneumatic doors.
C: BROOM
D: In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born.
N: Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. Myers stares.
C: BROOM
D: 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
C: MYERS
D: 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
C: BROOM
D: Did he, now?
E: enigmatic smile
N: They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least 4 feet high.
C: BROOM
D: Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his lead.
N: Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.
C: MYERS
D: You're not coming?
N: Broom signals "no."
C: BROOM
D: I hand-picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates. Make me proud.
N: The door closes behind him.
C: CLAY
D: They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
C: MYERS
D: Grounded? Who's grounded?
C: CLAY
D: Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
N: Myers nods.
C: CLAY
D: Well, come on in and meet the rest of the family.
N: Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open up.
S: INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT
N: Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the furniture. There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era. On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD.
C: CLAY
D: He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
E: sotto voce
C: MYERS
D: Who?!
N: Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape. Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats playfully paws at it.
C: MYERS
D: You're kidding --
E: sotto voce
C: HELLBOY
D: Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
N: The voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful.
C: MYERS
D: Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
E: to Clay, sotto voce
C: CLAY
D: Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
E: sotto voce
N: Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.
C: HELLBOY
D: What's with the hair, Clay?? Finally got those implants??
N: Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.
C: CLAY
D: It'll fill in. Where do you want your dinner, Red? By the couch?
N: On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face and raven-black hair.
C: HELLBOY
D: Who's the squirt?
C: CLAY
D: Agent Myers is your new liaison.
C: HELLBOY
D: Got tired of me?
C: CLAY
D: Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
N: BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers jumps.
C: HELLBOY
D: I don't want him.
C: CLAY
D: Manning says I'm too soft on you -- The candy. Give him the candy.
E: sotto voce, nudging Myers
N: Myers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths.
C: MYERS
D: Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
C: HELLBOY
D: Father's back? Still angry?
E: realizing Clay nods
C: CLAY
D: Well, you did break out --
C: HELLBOY
D: I wanted to see her. It's nobody's business.
E: grunts
C: CLAY
D: It is. You got yourself on TV again.
C: HELLBOY
D: "Myers", huh? You have a first name??
C: CLAY
D: Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
E: sotto to Myers
C: MYERS
D: Uh-oh -- John. Staring at what?
E: sotto
C: CLAY
D: His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
C: MYERS
D: His what??!!
N: Hellboy finally enters the light. He's awe-inspiring, with chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils. In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.
C: HELLBOY
D: Whatcha looking at, John??
C: MYERS
D: Oh-n-no -- I --
N: An ALARM sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. Myers looks around, bewildered.
C: HELLBOY
D: Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
E: to Clay
C: CLAY
D: We're on the move.
C: HELLBOY
D: C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
E: to Myers

N: An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments. A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER. Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED POLICE. Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan cars are waved through.
C: BLONDE REPORTER
D: The NYPD has yet to issue a statement. We've got SWAT vans, paramedics, you name it... and now here's -- a garbage truck -- -- a garbage truck?
E: double take
N: Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management Services.

N: AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.
S: EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT
N: The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.
S: INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT
N: The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans. ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills. Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.
C: HELLBOY
D: Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
C: ABE
D: Story of my life.
C: HELLBOY
D: I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding. Outside. I could be outside --
E: nostalgic
C: ABE
D: You mean, outside... with her.
N: Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.
C: HELLBOY
D: Don't get psychic with me.
C: ABE
D: Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
N: Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable cannon.
C: HELLBOY
D: How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
C: ABE
D: Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
C: HELLBOY
D: We don't take hints.
E: hefting the gun
S: EXT. COURTYARD / LOADING DOCK MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops. FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed cops and securing the doors. THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate, sealing off the area.
C: STONE
D: All areas secured.
N: From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear.
C: CLAY
D: Seal the doors. Red and Blue are coming in.
E: into a handheld radio
N: The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing HELLBOY and ABE.
C: CLAY
D: Okay, boys, let's synch up our locators.
N: Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking. OMIT
S: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT
N: As BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases. Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase.
C: CLAY
D: At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
E: reading a report
C: HELLBOY
D: Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
C: BROOM
D: Apparently not everything was fake.
N: Broom stands at the base of the marble staircase.
C: HELLBOY
D: Father...?
E: surprised to see him
N: Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze from that of the fragile old man.
S: INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT
N: They approach an oversize set of brass doors. Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids and concentrates. Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of bullets of all colors and shapes.
C: BROOM
D: A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
C: HELLBOY

C: BROOM
D: Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
C: HELLBOY
D: Reliquary --
C: BROOM
D: A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.

D: Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
E: pulling his hand away
N: Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of ancient magic.
C: HELLBOY
D: Oh, well. Lemme go in and say "hi".
N: As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow illuminates him. He steps inside.
S: INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT
N: BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen display case. He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and statues startle him. On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of uniforms and hats.
C: HELLBOY
D: Blue: It stinks in here -- Finely aged roadkill.
E: whispers into radio
N: The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to discover -- A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, but the jaws are shiny with blood.
C: HELLBOY
D: Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed. Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
E: beat
C: ABE
D: Red, I found something --
E: in earphone
S: INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT
N: Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one of the books.
C: ABE
D: There's not much here: the entity's name is Sammael, the desolate one, son of Nergal --
S: INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT
N: Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble and criss- crossed with blue veins.
C: HELLBOY
D: Hold it -- Hey, Sammy, whaddayasay we work this out?? Peacefully. I'm not a great shot, but -- "The Samaritan" here, uses really big bullets, so whadyasay we work this out?
E: beat raises his gun
N: Sammael stands and turns around -- CRACK-KKK!!! His waist twists him 360 degrees!! Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!! Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it grows still. OMIT
S: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT
C: HELLBOY
D: That's all for you, Sammy.
C: ABE'S VOICE
D: Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
E: in earpiece

D: Nah -- he's taken care of.

C: ABE'S VOICE
D: harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
C: HELLBOY
D: Skip to the end, willya? How do I kill it -- ?
C: ABE'S VOICE
D: It doesn't say --
N: BAMMM!! From out of nowhere, Sammael appears and swings an arm!! Hellboy CRASHES into the brass doors!
S: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - EXHIBIT CORRIDORS - NIGHT
N: The doors bulge and crack under Hellboy's impact. Abe and Broom backpedal fast. Myers pulls out his gun, and starts looking for another way in. Broom observes this, pleased.
S: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT
N: Sammael lashes out with a massive punch. HELLBOY goes K-KKRASH!!! K-KKRASH!!! through SIX glass cabinets, then hits a window, falling --
S: EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: -- two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage bin. Hellboy fights to stay conscious. Blood drips from his mouth
C: GRIGORY'S VOICE
D: Child...
N: Hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition, is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded by pitch-black sunglasses
C: GRIGORY
D: All grown up, I see.
N: Hellboy's in shock, confused.
C: HELLBOY
D: That voice --
C: GRIGORY
D: I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world. I alone know your true calling, your true name.
E: beat
C: HELLBOY
D: Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
N: Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground. He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.
C: GRIGORY
D: I can see that you're still young and don't know your place. Teach him.
E: turns to Sammael
N: Before Hellboy can reach the weapon -- WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm. Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's skin.
S: EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal SQUEAL!! Hellboy manages to roll away. Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.
C: HELLBOY
D: What do you think you're doing??
N: Myers proudly shows him the gun.
C: MYERS
D: Helping you -- I just --
C: HELLBOY
D: No one ever helps me. It's my job.
N: He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too much.
C: HELLBOY
D: Damn -- Okay. Here --
N: He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.
C: HELLBOY
D: -- Then load this.
E: throws it at Myers
N: In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.
C: HELLBOY
D: It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin. Load it.
N: KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it. Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows like a chemical flare.
C: MYERS
D: Jeez... What the hell is that?
N: He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, a big, black stinger is gleaming. Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe grape.
C: HELLBOY
D: Lemme go ask --
N: Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle. BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then -- BAM!!!! INSIDE GUN SHOT The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --
S: EXT. ALLEY
N: -- Sammael, still in mid-air. It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!! With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles after it.
S: EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT
N: On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP. He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.
C: MYERS
D: Wait! No, what are you doing?
N: LOADING DOCK / ALLEY Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full tilt. A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A few workers load pumpkin boxes in it. WORKER 1 What the hell is that?? Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area. A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch. Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick- or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON. Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof. 3 WORKERS (chorus) Whoa-whoa-whoa- Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: CRASH!!! The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, showered by thousands of glass shards. Myers is a few steps behind.
C: MYERS
D: We'll hit the street in a minute. We're heading towards civilians...
E: into headset
N: He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The vendors are yelling at him.
C: MYERS
D: Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick or treat!!
S: EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
N: Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR TREATERS scream. Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as Myers follows -- He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him! Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers, holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks. The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints. Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major traffic jam.
C: HELLBOY
D: Are you okay?
N: Myers opens his eyes, nods.
C: HELLBOY
D: Good. Stay here.
N: He moves after Sammael. OMIT
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael's gone. He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.
S: EXT./INT. STUNT TRACKS TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away. Seated.
C: HELLBOY
D: Waiting for me, Sammy?
N: A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles and puts away his gun.
C: HELLBOY
D: Uh-oh -- between a rock and a hard place --
N: But Sammael sprints towards it!
C: HELLBOY
D: Aw, crap --
N: Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm, then jumps at the front car -- OMIT
S: INT. STUNT TRACKS / FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT
N: smashing through glass and steel and raining sparks. Landing inside with a ROAR!!! --
S: EXT./INT. THE SUBWAY - 2 TRAIN CAR SET - NIGHT
N: SAMMAEL's tongue punches through the doors as he races through one -- two -- passenger cars and out the -- STUNT TRACK REAR 1/4 CAR -- rear of the train, back onto the tracks.
S: INT. STUNT TRACKS - NIGHT
N: Landing there safely.
S: INT. THE SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) - NIGHT
N: Now the train hurtles at Hellboy, who grimaces and does his best --
S: INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR
N: He leaps, but HUMPF!! He's hit! His legs rattle over the tracks.
S: INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT
N: Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through the steel floor and grabs a handhold. Steam and sparks explode everywhere. The TRAIN DRIVER grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming it against Hellboy's head.
C: HELLBOY
D: Hey! Hey! I'm on your side!!
N: BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!
S: INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR
N: The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He follows it, until it ends abruptly. He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of glowing goop hits his hand.
C: HELLBOY
D: Aw, I forgot --
N: He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops. Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug. Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex. Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re- knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A deep wound. Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking THIRD RAIL a few feet away. Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.
C: HELLBOY
D: Screw you.
N: Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still. Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a flame on his arm to light a cigar.
C: HELLBOY
D: I'm fireproof. You weren't.
E: puffs smoke, kicks the body
N: OMIT
S: EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses. Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form. His radio beeps.
C: HELLBOY
D: Myers??? How's your arm?

D: Goodbye.
N: He turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness of the tunnel. In the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred body.
S: INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT
N: An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. Kroenen stands next to it. ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's body. He cradles it like a precious stone.
C: GRIGORY
D: Sammael has fulfilled his destiny... Die in peace and be reborn again and again...
E: smiling
N: He closes his fist.
C: ILSA
D: Only seven more days to the eclipse, Grishka...
N: Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in fascination.
C: GRIGORY
D: The child will be there. And so will we all -- Won't we?
N: Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL silhouettes appear.

S: INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - NIGHT
N: Manning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning up. The dead guards are carried out.
C: MANNING
D: Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
C: BROOM
D: I thought you liked being on TV.
C: MANNING
D: I do. How many escapes? This year alone: five!
E: beat
C: BROOM
D: Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
C: MANNING
D: Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
C: BROOM
D: He's just going through a phase --
N: Manning moistens and lights a fine cigar, using a kitchen match.
C: MANNING
D: A "phase"? What do you think this is, "The Brady Bunch?" These... freaks --
N: ABE SAPIEN listens while pacing the exhibition hall, palm open.
C: MANNING
D: These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
E: lowers his voice, tense
C: BROOM
D: I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
N: Manning watches as Abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the floor.
C: MANNING
D: Hey, fishstick -- don't touch anything --
N: Abe silences him.
C: ABE
D: I need to touch it to "see"...
C: MANNING
D: See what??
C: ABE
D: The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
C: MANNING
D: Is he serious??
E: eyes Broom
C: ABE
D: Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
N: Abe holds the dagger in his hand, turns to Broom.
C: ABE
D: They were over here, Professor.
C: MANNING
D: Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
N: Broom examines the dagger: a RAGNAROK symbol crowns the hilt. The dragon and swastika.
C: BROOM
D: Show me, Abe... show me.
N: He solemnly extends his hand. As soon as Abe takes it, the room... MORPHS TO:
S: INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK
N: Hours earlier: the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness spectrally as -- A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking sound, he shines his light into a dark corner: no one's there. But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from the pool of shadows on the floor. It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe. On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly ticking gears. He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT. Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.
C: ILSA
D: Move.
N: She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case. The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on. Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a giant bone saw, slicing across the statue. No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears and the top half falls. KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and winds himself up. Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand. Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns at Kroenen. GUARD 1 You! Don't move! Hands up! Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two TWIN BLADES. bullet tears into Kroenen's arm, spewing forth an explosion of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers the steel, deflecting the bullets which -- -- ricochet wildly -- and finally hit three of the guards. They fall silently to the floor. Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives. The last guard raises his gun. GUARD 6 Don't -- Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted by an unseen force!! The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible force. He starts floating in mid-air. The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding an imaginary doll. His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, gaining strength. With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts of the guard's body in opposite directions. With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. Grigory looks at Ilsa.
C: GRIGORY
D: Ready the welcome, my love --
N: Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto the floor.
C: GRIGORY
D: Salt. Gathered from the tears of a thousand martyrs. Restraining the essence of Sammael, the hell hound, the seed of destruction.
N: Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle. Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL. It roars!!!

N: OMIT
S: INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions for the others to stay back. He extends his open palm and "feels" the air near the old man's back.
C: ABE
D: Professor..? You -- are very sick --
C: BROOM
D: I don't want Hellboy to know --
N: Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away.
C: BROOM
D: Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy the world. And they are back -- in my lifetime, they are back. To finish the job.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
N: A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music on picnic tables. On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack. Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.
S: EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
N: Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a... ...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden surrounds the building. Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.
S: INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line patients, distributing pills. Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands circle her wrist. Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something.
C: DOWN'S PATIENT
D: There's a big red guy down there!
E: pointing
C: DOCTOR MARSH
D: That's fine, darling, Santa's not here for another month.
E: readying more pills
C: DOWN'S PATIENT
D: Not Santa. Big and red. With gold eyes. And he has beer!
N: Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below seems empty.
S: EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT
N: Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it...
C: LIZ
D: Back so soon?
N: Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat. His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.
C: HELLBOY
D: Uh, I brought beer.
N: Liz shoots a Polaroid.
C: LIZ
D: To wash down my lithium pills? I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm still a patient.
E: beat
N: Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.
C: LIZ
D: You better have that looked at.
C: HELLBOY
D: Just a scratch. I wanted to see you.
E: shrug
N: Liz sighs.
S: EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT
N: Hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz.
C: HELLBOY
D: We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me -- Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
E: Liz smiles
C: LIZ
D: No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
N: Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms, crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at the pale flame.
C: LIZ
D: I'm learning where it comes from. And for once in my life I'm not afraid.
E: beat
N: She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.
C: LIZ
D: Looks like your ride is here.
N: The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the vehicles.
C: HELLBOY
D: The Nanny Squad.
N: ANGLE - THE CARS - CONTINUOUS Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns to Broom:
C: MYERS
D: Sir, may I go first??
C: CLAY
D: Not so fast. He barely knows him --
E: to Broom
C: BROOM
D: Then he should make it his business to change that.
E: cuts him off
N: ANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.
C: LIZ
D: Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out here. If you truly care about me, don't come back anymore.
N: Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.
C: HELLBOY
D: Goodnight, then.
C: LIZ
D: Goodnight.
N: She doesn't turn back.
C: HELLBOY
D: Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do --
N: Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his feet, a pool of his own blood. He sees Myers tentatively approaching.
C: HELLBOY
D: What took you so long?
C: MYERS
D: C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
C: HELLBOY
D: What are you, a Boy Scout?
C: MYERS
D: No. I never was.
C: HELLBOY
D: Could've fooled me. Go away.
E: weak
N: Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him. Help him up.
C: CLAY
D: C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
C: HELLBOY
D: This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me? Her.
E: points at the doorway
N: Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over. A few of the agents help him to the vehicles. Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes inside. OMIT
S: INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY "A" - NIGHT
N: In the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him. Abe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy's wounded arm.
C: ABE
D: You were burned by some organic acid.
C: HELLBOY
D: I'm lucky that way.
N: Using a scalpel, Abe probes the gash. Hellboy lets out a GRUNT.
C: BROOM
D: Son. About Rasputin --
C: HELLBOY
D: Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
C: BROOM
D: Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
C: HELLBOY
D: How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
C: BROOM
D: I worry about you.
C: HELLBOY
D: Me?? C'mon --
C: BROOM
D: Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
C: HELLBOY
D: Oh, stop that -- Damn! Be careful, there --
E: grimaces in pain
C: ABE
D: Red. How long was it latched onto you?
C: HELLBOY
D: I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
C: MYERS
D: You want me to hold him down?
C: HELLBOY
D: That's right, Stud, hold me down.
E: snickers
C: ABE
D: Professor...
N: Broom moves to Abe's side of the table. Abe is poking at the depths of the wound.
C: BROOM
D: Don't look! Turn around.
E: sharp, to Hellboy
C: HELLBOY
D: Is it bad?
N: Broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS. Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits it in a glass container.
C: ABE
D: Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
C: HELLBOY
D: Didn't even buy me a drink.
S: INT. MEDICAL BAY. EXAMINATION TABLE - LATER
N: The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.
C: ABE
D: The eggs are very sensitive to heat and light. They need a humid, dark environment to breed.
N: Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.
C: MYERS
D: Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
C: HELLBOY
D: Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
N: Broom frowns, worried.
C: BROOM
D: We can't risk it: You'll go back to the tracks tomorrow with a group of agents, search the area, top to bottom.
E: to Hellboy
N: Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal THING wiggles.
S: INT. BROOMÂ´S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Myers stands by Broom's desk as the old man places a new set of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank.
C: MYERS
D: I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
C: BROOM
D: You're doing fine.
N: At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting in the shadows near the door.
C: MYERS
D: No, I'm not. He respects Clay. Not me. I don't know why you chose me, Sir. But I'm not qualified.
N: Discouraged, Myers heads for the door.
C: BROOM
D: I'm dying Agent Myers.
E: very quiet
N: Shocked, Myers looks over at Broom.
C: BROOM
D: And as a father, I worry about him. In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
E: directly to Myers
C: MYERS
D: Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
C: ABE
D: Yes, you are.
C: BROOM
D: What I ask from you is -- Have the courage to stand by his side after I'm gone. Help him find himself. Who he must be. He was born a Demon... You will help him become a man.

S: INT. B.R.P.D. ARCHIVE / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
N: Dozens of HELLBOY clippings flash by: tabloid headlines along with intimate images of Hellboy as a KID. H.B. at 7, at 12, dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side. Myers works at a computer workstation. He brings up a small photograph in an old issue of The Enquirer. The headline: "ARSON SUSPECT NOW WORKING FOR SECRET GOVERNMENT AGENCY" There's a photo of a woman, taken with a telephoto lens. Another clipping: young LIZ, 11, and a photo of a tenement building burned to the ground: TRAGIC EXPLOSION. A QUICKTIME interview pops up. LIZ, in her early twenties. A caption reads: ELIZABETH SHERMAN, first interview, BPRD, PYROKINETIC. She has a POLAROID camera in her hands. Shoots one at the lens.
C: LIZ
D: I don't like the term "firestarter." I just don't. And "Pyrokinesis" sounds like psychosis or something. I dunno -- maybe that's right. Not being able to let go -- Scary. Sometimes you hear so-and-so lost control and just exploded. They're lucky it isn't true. With me -- it is.
E: shrug beat looks at the camera
N: OMIT
S: INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: Two strolling ORDERLIES shine their flashlights inside the rooms on both sides of a long corridor.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SECURITY WARD - NIGHT
N: A flashlight beam sweeps Liz's room. It illuminates a CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes of everyday life. When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, still asleep. As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the bed, extending his right hand.
C: GRIGORY
D: The Master is calling your name now, my girl. We are all part of his plan. You must return to the child... So, once again...
N: He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin, a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His fingers start to glow.
C: GRIGORY
D: ...dream of fire.
N: Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead. FLASH BACK TO:
S: EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY
N: Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement courtyard. ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone, a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest. A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps, carrying a basket of apples.
C: MOTHER
D: Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give Mummy a hand.
E: to Liz
N: Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.
C: BLONDE KID
D: Freak!
N: Liz turns to see them.
C: BLONDE KID
D: See? She knows her name.
E: to his friend
N: Liz shies away from them.
C: BLONDE KID
D: Go home, you freak. We don't want you here.
N: They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder. Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across, but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash. A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale blue flame rings her entire arm.
C: LIZ
D: Not again, please, not again...
E: sobbing
N: Firelight glints off the crucifix.
S: EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - DAY
N: MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.

D: Mommy! Mommy!
N: Mother sees...

N: Liz: outlined by licking flames!
C: LIZ
D: Mommy! Help me! I'm burning!
E: panicked
N: Mother screams, horrified.
C: LIZ
D: Help meee!!!
N: She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then the rest of the people are -- THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD -- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches, people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball. The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one figure left standing: Liz... a little girl, still crying. FLASH FORWARD TO:
S: INT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT
N: Liz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs. The rubber bands on her wrist vaporize.

N: The glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor.
S: INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
N: In their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on a panel. They silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low rumble shakes the room. Through the VIBRATING glass window they see... CORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE ...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.
C: ORDERLY
D: Oh my --

D: It's her choice -- She's human --
E: beat
C: HELLBOY
D: Oh, as opposed to -- ?
N: Broom grows silent. Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every time he goes at the round stumps.

D: Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
C: MYERS
D: Professor, that girl you were talking about --

D: Hey. You: think twice --

S: INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY
N: Myers looks at LIZ through a see-through mirror. She sits on a bench inside a padded cell. A security CAMERA AND MONITOR records her constantly. A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him.
C: DOCTOR MARSH
D: She's been like this since it happened. There were no casualties. But it's put a big dent in our Thorazine supply... Are you sure you want to go in?
E: dubious look at Myers

C: LIZ
D: Doesn't sounds like him.
C: MYERS
D: Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.

S: INT. BEAM TUNNEL AREA - BENJAMIN INSTITUTE - DAY
N: An explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes through a dank tunnel. Then, light beams sweep the encrusted walls and steel columns. Clay and some B.P.R.D. agents hold flashlights. Two of them -- MOSS and QUARRY -- carry FLAMETHROWERS. Hellboy and Abe bring up the rear.
S: INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY
N: They enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets, typewriters and school desks. A turn-of-the-century mural depicts happy boys doing charitable acts. A Latin phrase ("VIRILITER AGE") encourages them to behave like men.
C: QUARRY
D: We're in the cellar of the Benjamin Institute. Turn-of-the-century orphanage. Closed since they moved the sewers in '51.

S: INT. (SET/LOCATION BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY
N: Makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING. At a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his own. His face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw gums and taut skin. As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles blindly on the table. He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.
S: INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY
N: The wall collapses under Hellboy's attack.

E: to Quarry and Moss
S: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
N: A large oval room of rusting metal, with pipes spilling water through a large GRATE on the floor. Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out.

S: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
N: Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices synchronize. Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone.
C: HELLBOY
D: There you go, Doctor. This should cover your tailfin -- On loan from the Vatican, a bone from Saint Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky.
N: Abe ties the reliquary around his hand.
C: ABE
D: Remind me why I keep doing this.

D: Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
C: ABE
D: Oh, right --
N: As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives.
S: INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY
N: Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.
S: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
N: Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans from the past. Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866. Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a hand mirror.
C: CLAY
D: See? It's thicker. Isn't it? It's not that doll-hair thing --
N: Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer caught in headlights.
C: HELLBOY
D: Son of a -- !
N: The figure darts away. Hellboy tears after it, gun in hand.
C: CLAY
D: Red, wait!
N: Clay tries his radio. Static.
C: CLAY
D: Red's on the move!! I'll cover him!!
N: He pulls out his gun and runs after Hellboy.
S: INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY
N: Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.
C: CLAY
D: Damn it, Red.
S: INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY
N: Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent egg! Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing. He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one. Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines. Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It lands -- on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up -- -- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!! The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure. Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to reach deeper, screaming in rage. Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.
S: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY
N: The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND SAMMAEL.
S: INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY
N: Hellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs the air, then steps through a non-descript portal.
S: INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY
N: Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens of old photos of children. He discovers the Sammael engraving.
C: HELLBOY
D: "Sammael: seed of destruction. Death becomes the fertile ground."
N: Suddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam.
C: HELLBOY
D: Didn't I kill you already?
E: turning
N: Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service shaft... ...and it's a long way down. When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side. OMIT
S: INT. SERVICE SHAFT (NEW LOCATION SET) - DAY

N: another passage. There they bounce off of dripping water pipes and jutting steel I beams, until they finally break through a mesh/insulation ceiling and directly onto --
S: INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY
N: A subway platform. Full of people. The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change. The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform floor. Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of turnstiles, uprooting them all. Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS from the fleeing public. A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant. Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars -- Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's stone hand emerges, triumphant.
C: HELLBOY
D: Hey, Chunk-face!
N: He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.
C: HELLBOY
D: You can do better than that. Big monster like you.
N: Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael again and again.
C: HELLBOY
D: See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit people!
N: Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds itself in the tile wall. Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut. Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, scraping a jagged line with his stone hand. He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a wooden bench, breaking it in two. Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine. Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS abandoned on a bench.
C: YOUND GIRL
D: My kittens!! My kittens!!!
C: HELLBOY
D: Aw, crap.
N: Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench. Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking citizens. Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, blood dripping from his forehead and nose. Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps the tongue with his stone hand --
C: HELLBOY
D: Second date. No tongue!!
N: -- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are fine. Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window. Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged glass. Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel. Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems lost, when... WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight for Sammael. It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks. OMIT

N: Hellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the platform.
C: HELLBOY
D: This time. Stay dead, willya??
E: a whisper
N: He moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out.
S: INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY
N: Under the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending.
S: INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY
N: Badly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not there. He quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT.
S: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
N: Abe staggers out of the pool and hides behind a crumbling shower stall. Behind him, two SHAPES come to the surface. Shaking, Abe pushes his belt locator and collapses.

C: MOSS
D: Jesus --
N: Their locators light up.
C: QUARRY
D: Abe --
N: Suddenly -- a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their flashlights over the columns... Nothing there.
C: QUARRY
D: Moss, what the hell was that?
N: Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls boom like thunderclaps. Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. Useless: the things plow on. Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few seconds, a green light beeps, READY. The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of fire into the blackness. The men pause: silence! Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.
C: QUARRY
D: Whatever it was --
N: BAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare: TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head. Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back, breaking his spine.

S: INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
N: Hellboy enters to find Abe, bleeding but alive, leaning against the tile, blue blood all around him. Hellboy tries his walkie-talkie. Turns on his locator. It sparks. It's damaged and broken.

D: Who's there? Clay? Come in, someone.
E: on the walkie-talkie
C: CLAY
D: Clay, Code 30, this is Clay, over...
N: Behind Clay, Kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through shafts of gray light. He brings forth his customary long blade. Clay turns in time to see Kroenen coming at him. He fires. Kroenen stabs. Twin rivulets of blood run from Clay's nostrils.
S: INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH - CONNECTING SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY
N: Hellboy hears the gunfire, starts running.
S: INT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET)
N: Clay falls to the floor. Kroenen stands there, unfazed by Clay's bullets in his chest. Dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet. He hears Hellboy coming.He places the knife on the floor, then lies down and plays dead. Hellboy appears at the end of the tunnel. He glances at Kroenen's body, then quickly checks for a pulse on Clay. Hellboy looks demolished.

N: An ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She passes it to Myers:
C: LIZ
D: It feels good to be outside!! It's been so long...
N: He can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the bulletproof acrylic divider.
C: MYERS
D: Hey!! The music!! Turn down the music!!
C: DRIVER
D: Yeah, yeah, music!!
N: He merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the same volume. Myers looks back at Liz. She is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.
C: MYERS
D: Jesus! That's not -- That's not safe, Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman?
N: She takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the other window, hands her the photograph.
C: MYERS
D: Nice view --
N: He waves at her. For the first time, she smiles.
C: MYERS
D: A smile, huh? That's good.
N: She takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.
C: LIZ
D: Don't get used to it.
N: Myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music. He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD.
S: INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - DAY
N: Unconscious, Abe floats in a special tank. LED strips read water temperature, pH level, etc. He's encased in a bio-cast: a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right arm. A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place. SHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if in a trance.
C: MANNING'S VOICE
D: He'll make it --
N: Hellboy turns, Manning is there:
C: MANNING
D: But not everyone was so lucky. Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.

C: HELLBOY
D: I wish I could be more gracious but --
E: a deep sigh
N: BAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand and raises it above his head. Manning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous thing.
S: INT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY
N: A new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer stations and tactical glass boards. Liz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks around and sees BROOM coming down the hall.
C: BROOM
D: Welcome back.
C: LIZ
D: It's only for the weekend, Professor Broom. Then I'll be on my way --
C: BROOM
D: Come and go as you please. Find your way back. We've made quite a few changes --
E: impeccable courtesy beat
N: CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs. Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed.
C: MANNING
D: I want that thing locked up, starting now -- Now!!! You hear me??!!
E: gasping
N: He flees.
C: LIZ
D: Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home.
E: to Broom
N: Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps through the hole in the wall.
C: HELLBOY
D: Liz? Liz!!
E: seeing her
N: She spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers.
C: HELLBOY
D: You!!! You did it, buddy --

D: Woo hoo!!
E: oblivious
S: INT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY
N: A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway. She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, then lets it snap.
C: LIZ
D: A little something I learned in therapy. I'm depressed -- One rubber band. I'm impatient: two rubber bands...
E: snaps a rubber band
N: He sits by her side on the bed.
C: MYERS
D: I'll get you a fresh pack.
S: INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK
N: A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it in a brimming wastebasket. He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload of CHILI.
C: MYERS
D: Where do you --
C: HELLBOY
D: Shh! Just a second.
N: Myers sets the tray on the table.
C: HELLBOY
D: Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --

D: "Need" is a good, solid word.
C: HELLBOY
D: Nah, sounds too "needy."
C: MYERS
D: Start in, you got nachos coming.

C: LIZ
D: Oh, my God... Look at them all! Who had babies? C'mere, Tiger...!
E: notices the small feline army
N: Liz plays with a cat. Hellboy lifts the piece of paper, which looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand.
C: HELLBOY
D: Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.

D: Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --

C: BROOM
D: Suffered a masochistic compulsion known as surgical addiction.
N: The silver hand and harness lie on a table.
C: BROOM
D: Both eyelids were surgically removed along with his upper and lower lips, making speech impossible. The blood in his veins dried up decades ago. Only dust remains. Four pulverized vertebrae. A steel rod inserted into his pelvis held him up. What horrible will power could keep a thing like this alive?

D: No. Enough. He will never change -- always a child. Always.
S: INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT
N: Kroenen's body lies on the table. Slowly, his chest starts to rise and fall. He sits up. His arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- Click! He flexes the shiny fingers. Kroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before he zips up his mask. He takes the sharp Ragnarok knives and turns one over. It reflects a figure standing behind him: Grigory.
S: EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT
N: The pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses of milk and a plate of cookies.
C: KID
D: My Mom baked 'em.
N: He sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting and laughing.

D: SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16... Moscow.
E: pensive
N: Broom pulls out a few old photos. Finds one of Grigory in German uniform, and in a book, another of Grigory in an Orthodox priest's black cassock. He pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from it. His fingers scan the text, finding Rasputin's date of birth, date of death. They pause at a particular line: "His mausoleum is at SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16".
C: BROOM
D: It's Rasputin's mausoleum.
N: TCHK!! A noise -- Broom turns in time to see Kroenen delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. In spite of all his experience, Broom is shaken.

N: FLASH!! A nightmarish tableau...
S: EXT. RUINS OF N.Y. - DUSK
N: The ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against the blood-red sky. Dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly fire.
S: INT. BROOMÂ´S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Startled, Broom snaps out of it --
C: GRIGORY
D: If only you had him destroyed sixty years ago, none of this would come to pass. But, then, how could you have known?
N: Broom is speechless.

D: Your God chooses to remain silent. Mine lives within me.
N: Rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving and twitching beneath his human skin.
C: GRIGORY
D: In the frozen waters of the Malaya Nevka, in the darkness of the void: every time I died and crossed over, a little more of the Master came back with me. He disclosed to me the child's true name... Would you like to know it??
C: BROOM
D: I know what to call him. Nothing you can say or do will change that. I call him son.
N: Discreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the book. Kroenen settles in behind him.

C: GRIGORY
D: June 30th, 1908. It burned hundreds of square miles of forest. The Romanovs took possession of it immediately. The Czar guarded it jealously -- I have wanted it for ages.
N: Grigory's fingers brush over its smooth, perfect surface. At the center -- -- TWO CIRCULAR IMPRINTS that match Hellboy's four-fingered stone hand.
C: GRIGORY
D: Now, finally, it's mine.
C: GENERAL LAPIKOV
D: You are aware, of course, there's no way you'll get it out of Russian territory.
C: ILSA
D: He is aware.
E: curtly
N: Ilsa brings out a chrome box, full of gold.
C: GENERAL LAPIKOV
D: It's a pleasure doing business with you. Perhaps you have other interests.
N: Grigory's voice drips with serene brutality.
C: GRIGORY
D: Enjoy the bright metal you've earned. There will be no further transactions. Only closure.

S: EXT. THE NIGHT SKY (MATTE SHOT) - NIGHT
N: A massive CARGO PLANE slices the white eye of a full moon. A map details the plane's journey over the Black Sea. Super: RUSSIAN AIRSPACE - BLACK SEA.
S: INT. CARGO PLANE - NIGHT
N: As the plane engines DRONE, Myers supervises BPRD agents Lime and Stone, who stencil a large crate: FRAGILE! LIVE CARGO. Hellboy and Liz stand around a brightly-lit work table. Hellboy shows them the medieval illustration of Sammael.
C: HELLBOY
D: "One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.

D: When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
N: MANNING shows them a set of GRENADE BELTS.
C: MANNING
D: We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
C: HELLBOY

N: Popping her head out of the window, Liz looks back at the truck bed.
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK BED - DAY
N: Fastened to it, the crate labelled: LIVE CARGO. Small breathing holes have been drilled in the sides.
C: HELLBOY'S VOICE
D: Sparky?? Who came up with that? Myers?

N: Hellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark.
C: LIZ'S VOICE
D: We're leaving the main road, so hang on --
E: on radio
N: They hit a series of bumps. The box rattles and shakes. Hellboy bangs his head. The vehicle lurches to a halt.
C: HELLBOY
D: This better be the place or I'll puke.
E: on the radio
N: Motors are turned off. The crate is opened. Liz peeks in.
C: LIZ
D: Come out and see.
S: EXT. 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY - DAY
N: Hellboy steps out. Takes a moment to adjust his eyes to the light.
C: HELLBOY
D: Sebastian Plackba #16...
N: 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY (MATTE SHOT / COMPOSITE) Broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines. Endless rows of crypts and tombstones poke through wild foliage. Our group plus TWO AGENTS (Lime and Stone) venture into the labyrinthine lanes of the dead. Each carries a backpack, a flashlight and a gun.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CEMETERY - MAUSOLEUM SECTION (LOCATION) - DAY
N: Later. The group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque funerary monuments. Myers -- carrying the explosive belts -- looks around.
C: MANNING
D: Forget it. This is practically a city. And it stinks, and it's muddy. We'll go back, check into a hotel, regroup after breakfast. We'll have to make a grid, go by quadrants. Maybe satellite photography.
N: He gestures and all the agents head for the vans.
C: HELLBOY
D: Let me ask for directions.
S: EXT. OPEN GRAVE - DAY
N: The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone cover and then jumps in.
S: EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY
N: -- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse lies in a miserable black suit.
C: HELLBOY
D: Animam edere, animus corpus...
E: whispers
N: He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment, nothing, and then... ...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?
S: EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY
N: The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.
C: HELLBOY
D: Sixty feet further, comrades, and three rows in...
N: The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly points, as if in confirmation.
C: HELLBOY
D: This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say "hi" Ivan.
N: The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY
N: A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the desiccated abomination on his back, walks in. OMIT
S: INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY
N: Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group descends carefully. The walls are dotted with yellowed skulls.
S: INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE
N: Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION
N: They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE attop a pile of coffins.
C: HELLBOY
D: We'll be alright... as long as we don't separate --
S: INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY
N: TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and ramming Stone: he's gone. Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz and Myers are on the other side.
C: HELLBOY
D: Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
E: into his walkie-talkie
C: LIZ
D: Marco...
C: HELLBOY
D: ...Polo.
N: On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from Liz.
C: MYERS
D: Are you sure about this?
E: into radio
C: HELLBOY
D: On a scale of one to ten: two. But -- -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
E: beat
N: Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and follows.
S: INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY
N: Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down the walls. Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal structure. They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead. Somewhere, a massive clockwork is TICKING.
C: MANNING
D: What's that --
N: Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S SOMETHING BIG" They stare into the darkness.
C: MANNING
D: We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
C: HELLBOY
D: Don't move. We --
C: MANNING
D: -- should go back. Now!
C: HELLBOY
D: No. Don't --
C: MANNING
D: I'm in charge. We go back!
N: Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the CORPSE with it. Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.
C: HELLBOY
D: Son of a --
N: Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under the door. Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his feet. The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door -- -- and makes it into the hexagonal building.
S: INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of rusty steel blades. Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously proceed...
S: INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
N: There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE. Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.
S: INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.
C: MANNING
D: Ouch!!
S: INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
N: Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself up.
S: INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back into the chamber -- -- Kroenen is gone.
C: HELLBOY
D: Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach --
E: to Manning
N: Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.
S: INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY
N: Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. Manning moves along behind him. The record finishes playing. Silence -- SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- -- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate blocks. Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.
C: HELLBOY
D: Screw that.
N: Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, smashing its lenses.
C: HELLBOY
D: You killed my father --
N: BAMMM!!!! another hit. Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls off.
C: HELLBOY
D: Give your soul to God, Your ass is mine.
N: An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is laughing.
S: INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and Manning drop through, along with the phonograph. Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's hand, but loses his backpack. He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.
C: MANNING
D: Well, it's not that big a fall...
E: panting, whispers
N: KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot, sparkling steel blades.
S: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound. As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.
S: INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso. MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand over hand.
S: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: Kroenen goes to cut the rope...
S: INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
C: HELLBOY
D: Oh, no you don't --
E: reaching the top
N: Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit! With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the blades.
S: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.
S: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm, slicing through his own ropy bicep.
C: HELLBOY
D: You like playing possum, you Nazi pinhead? Then try playing dead.
E: beat
S: INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits a horrid scream as it crushes him.
S: INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY
N: Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels down.
C: HELLBOY
D: Are you okay?
N: Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up his Zippo.
C: HELLBOY
D: You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
C: MANNING
D: You call that thing a cigar??
C: HELLBOY
D: Yup.
C: MANNING
D: You never, ever light a cigar that way.
N: He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to HELLBOY.
C: MANNING
D: Use a wooden match. It preserves the flavor.
N: He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.
C: MANNING
D: Thank you.
C: HELLBOY
D: My job.
E: smiles
N: OMIT
S: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY
N: A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully. Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...
C: MYERS
D: So, he thinks that you and I... That's why he's mad at me --
N: A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders. They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.
C: MYERS
D: But it's not true, is it?
C: LIZ
D: What -- ?
C: MYERS
D: That you feel that way about me.
C: LIZ
D: You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
S: INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY
N: Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath. Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly hear Liz and Myers.
S: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY
N: Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find themselves calf-deep in brown water. Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.
C: MYERS
D: Watch out. It's slippery...
N: His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.
C: LIZ
D: Oh, my God...
N: Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent eggs. SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils constrict. A snarl... A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself off. A THIRD ONE raise its head. Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!! Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.
C: LIZ
D: Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big Red butt over here!
E: into the radio
N: Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again and again.
S: INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY
N: Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.
C: HELLBOY
D: Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!
N: The rocks below him start to crumble.
S: EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY
N: In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.
S: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY
N: Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with pebbles. One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed. Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two new ones. Liz sprints to safety.
C: HELLBOY
D: Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two alone.
N: Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz. Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back. Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. They're FIVE. Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy is in trouble. Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her body.
C: LIZ
D: Hit me.
E: at Myers
C: MYERS
D: What?
N: Liz is desperate, crying.
C: LIZ
D: Hit me -- All of my life I've run away from it... Now I want it to happen! Do it.
E: beat
N: Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.
C: MYERS
D: I can't, I --
N: Liz slaps him.
C: LIZ
D: I know now: I love him. I've always loved him.
N: A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.
C: LIZ
D: Go now.
N: Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire. The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce. On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.
C: HELLBOY
D: Liz...
E: weak
N: The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of fire expands. The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.
S: INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY
N: The screen FADES TO WHITE and then... Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat. Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, on her side, unconscious. Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd comedy. Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him with a hammer --
T: FADE OUT / FADE IN
N: OMIT
S: INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church- like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar. Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts. Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab bought from Lapikov. Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.
C: GRIGORY
D: "And I looked and beheld an Angel, and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit..."
N: Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't bend.
C: GRIGORY
D: These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that they might at long last enter our world.
E: gestures at the stone piece
C: ILSA
D: You are the key! The right hand of doom!
E: to Hellboy
N: Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --
C: ILSA
D: What did you think it was made for? Open the locks.
E: triumphant
N: Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first time.
C: MYERS
D: Don't do it!! Don't do it!!
N: Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.
C: ILSA
D: Silence!!
N: The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.
C: ILSA
D: Imagine it: An eden for you and her --
C: HELLBOY
D: No.
N: Grigory turns to Hellboy.
C: GRIGORY
D: No? In exchange for her life then, open the door.
E: reasonable
N: In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.
C: GRIGORY
D: As you wish.
N: He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. Then she goes limp.
C: GRIGORY
D: She's dead.
C: HELLBOY
D: Noooo! Noooo!!!
N: He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the eclipse.
C: GRIGORY
D: Her soul awaits on the other side. If you want her back... Open the door and claim her.
E: beat
N: His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed. He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.
C: HELLBOY
D: For her.
N: Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. It lands near Myers.
C: GRIGORY
D: Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads." And crossroads I have become. Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
E: beat beat
C: HELLBOY
D: Anung-un-Rama...
E: closing his eyes
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a winter's night. Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone turns black as obsidian.
C: MYERS
D: No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!
N: HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock. A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.
S: EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT
N: Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's more intense, with ripples and haloes.
S: INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
N: Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. The ruby beam pierces the darkness.
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: a burning glyph. Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his skin, but he manages to free one hand.
S: EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
N: OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the frame.
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He turns it. Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --
S: INT. THE SKY - NIGHT
N: IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.
C: GRIGORY
D: The final seal. Open it!
N: Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers her full in the face. She staggers back and down.
C: MYERS
D: Remember who you are!!!
E: to Hellboy
N: He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy catches it. It smokes in his hand. He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts. Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory. With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the stumps. He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn. The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers and the connection with the moon is broken. Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended. Grigory crumples in agony. The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.
C: GRIGORY
D: You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
C: HELLBOY
D: I can live with that.
N: He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers stands by his side. He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down the steps. Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.
C: GRIGORY
D: Child...
N: Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.
C: GRIGORY
D: Look what you've done --
E: dying
N: He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift lazily.
C: GRIGORY
D: You've killed me -- an insignificant man... but you have brought forth a God.
N: He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out of the wound, like intestines. A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the air.
C: GRIGORY
D: Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.
N: Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape -- BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by the second. Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.
C: ILSA
D: Hell will hold no surprises for us.
N: A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.
S: INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to Myers.
C: HELLBOY
D: Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
C: MYERS
D: Alone?
C: HELLBOY
D: How big can it be?
N: As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash onto HELLBOYÂ´S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, finally confronting --
S: INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house -- Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling. As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open. Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way. The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding cogwheels and gears. Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble statue. Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the floor, rolling into the crack. From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward. He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, onto the first ledge. It crumbles!! The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide away. A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, he grabs the belts with his tail. The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever seen. Hellboy's tail passes him the belts. The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.
C: HELLBOY
D: They never work --
N: He wraps them around his stone arm.
C: HELLBOY
D: Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --
N: He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him into a squid-like beak and gulps him down. After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's innards. Then --
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy organs. The creature starts to burn. OMIT
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh. Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!! With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.
S: INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
N: Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light ripple over the ground.
C: HELLBOY
D: Ouch -- It did hurt.
S: INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL
N: Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor. Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest and whispers in her ear. A beat or two, then a moan.
C: LIZ
D: In the dark -- I heard your voice -- What -- did you say -- ?
N: He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.
C: HELLBOY
D: "You, on the other side: let her go. Because for her, for her -- I'll die. I'll cross over." "And you'll be sorry I did."
E: beat
N: Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her body. Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated by the flames. Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
