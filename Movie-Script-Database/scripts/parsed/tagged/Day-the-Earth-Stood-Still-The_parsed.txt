M: February 21, 1951
S: EXT. BEACH - PACIFIC ISLAND - MED. SHOT - DAY
N: Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.) (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build to an exciting crescendo).
S: EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY
N: A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)
S: INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT
N: The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates that it is 2:26
S: EXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT
N: The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage.
S: INT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT
N: The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his microphone and starts making a report back to his base in Russian.
S: EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT -
N: NIGHT A group of French farmers is collected around a radio, listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses himself. SPLIT SCREEN SHOT
S: RIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION -
N: DAY A breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind him is a clock which reads 3:32.
S: LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION -
N: NIGHT A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it almost impossible to control his excitement.
C: BRITISH ANNOUNCER
D: Reports are coming in from all over the Empire -- from all over the world. The Government have not yet issued a statement, but there seems to be no question that there actually is a large, unidentified object circling the earth at incredible speed.
N: This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...
C: AMERICAN ANNOUNCER
D: We still don't know what it is or where it's from - but we do know there's something there. It's been tracked around the world by radar traveling at a rate of four thousand miles an hour.
E: staccato with excitement
S: INT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE  DAY
N: The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, as we hear the voice of another radio reporter.
C: 2ND RADIO REPORTER
D: This is not another "flying saucer" scare. Scientists and military men have already agreed on that. Whatever this is -- it's something real.
E: voice off scene
S: EXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION
N: The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's tank is overflowing.
C: 3RD RADIO REPORTER
D: We interrupt this program to give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units at sea. "A large object, traveling at supersonic speed, is headed over the North Atlantic toward the east coast of the United States."
E: voice off scene
N: Music builds to a climax and ends.
S: INT. WASHINGTON RADIO STATION
C: 4TH RADIO REPORTER
D: Here in the nation's capital, there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic. As a matter of fact, there are signs of normalcy that seem strangely out of place; the beautiful spring weather, the tourist crowds at the various monuments and public buildings...
E: with deliberately controlled calm
S: EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)
N: A small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the columned entrance.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCK)
N: Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two shots that we are unconscious of it.
S: EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK) EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT
N: Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers. MED. SHOT Including several small groups of people moving toward the Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror. MED. CLOSE SHOT Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful sound keeps increasing in volume. CLOSE SHOT A man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky with his eyes. He is held terror-stricken. LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT) A giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the earth at incredible speed. LONG SHOT ON GROUND A group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn. A huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be pursing them. LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT) The great shape is considerably nearer now. CLOSE SHOT Of a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she sees and hears. LONG SHOT People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area. The tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the great ship settles gently to a perfect landing. MED. SHOT - THE SHIP The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its source or its intention. LONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL) Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance. CLOSE SHOT - MAN As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh. MED. CLOSE SHOT A woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, turns and runs away. MED. SHOT A middle-aged man runs up to a group of several people, pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally:
C: MAN
D: They're here! They're here!
N: He runs off toward another group as we--

N: MONTAGE A series of short DISSOLVES showing: 1. A man dashing up to a crowded Washington street corner shouting wildly and gesticulating in the direction from which he came. 2. Policemen piling into squad cars, which roar out of their garage. 3. Soldiers rushing out of a barracks at Fort Myer, with rifles and side arms, to form up on their company street. 4. Newspaper presses rolling at high speed. 5. Newscasters chattering excitedly into their microphones. 6. A large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in.

S: INT. RADIO AND TELEVISION STUDIO - MED. SHOT
N: A nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this script let's say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio mike. He is also being photographed by TV cameras. In a wall near him is a TV screen which shows what is going out on the air. During the ensuing speech, a man comes in a hands him a sheaf of news bulletins.
C: PEARSON
D: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is Drew Pearson. We bring you this special radio-television broadcast to give you the latest information on the landing of the "space ship" in Washington.
N: CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON
C: PEARSON
D: Government and Defense Department officials are concerned by reports of panic in several large Eastern cities. I am authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm. The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false. I repeat -- these rumors are absolutely false!
N: ANOTHER ANGLE
C: PEARSON
D: The ship, designed for travel outside the earth's atmosphere, landed in Washington today at 3:47 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. We still don't know where it came from, but I can reveal that military leaders are considering two possibilities; that it came from some unfriendly power here on earth -- or that it actually arrived from another planet.
N: CAMERA PANS to and DOLLIES IN on the TV screen in the wall. On the screen is a shot of the space ship.
C: PEARSON'S VOICE
D: The ship is resting exactly where it landed two hours ago, and there has been no sign of life from inside it.
E: over scene
N: OUR CAMERAL HOLDS on the TV screen. The cuts that follow are inside the frame of the screen:
S: EXT. THE MALL - MED. SHOT
N: Two platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship, their rifles at the ready.
C: PEARSON'S VOICE
D: Troops have been rushed from Fort Myer and they have formed a cordon around the ship.
E: over scene
N: MED. SHOT showing two machine guns, two Sherman tanks and two 75MM guns. The gun crews are posted for action and all weapons are trained on the space ship.
C: PEARSON'S VOICE
D: They are supported by machine guns, tanks and artillery.
E: over scene
N: MED. SHOT - POLICE CORDON Cops are holding back a section of a large crowd, some distance away from the ship. The people are wide-eyed and tense with excitement.
C: PEARSON'S VOICE
D: Behind police lines, there is a large crowd of curiosity seekers.
E: over scene
T: SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL CUTS
N: 1. Civilians in the crowd, their eyes and nerves taut with suspense. 2. A young soldier, who grips his rifle and moistens his lips nervously, his eyes never leaving the ship. 3. A tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an unmoving object. 4. The last cut is of the ship itself.
C: PEARSON'S VOICE
D: As you can see for yourself, the Army has taken every precaution to meet whatever the situation may require. Every eye -- every weapon -- is trained on the ship. It's been this way for two hours and the tension--
E: over scene
N: CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON as he interrupts himself excitedly, his attention riveted on the TV screen.
C: PEARSON
D: Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen! I think I see something moving!
S: EXT. THE MALL - MED. LONG SHOT - DAY
N: We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented pipe with a convex cap on it. REVERSE ANGLE on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of activity from the ship. They shift uneasily, gripping their rifles more firmly. MED. SHOT - THE SHIP After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the impression that it is more a formal headdress than for protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.
T: INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS
N: of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen. The newsreel and TV men are busy at their cameras. MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.
C: KLAATU
D: We have come to visit you in peace -- and with good will.
N: Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or it might be some strange kind of weapon. MED. SHOT shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do. CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER A young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine. MED. SHOT Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader raises his carbine to his shoulder. MED. CLOSE SHOT of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires. MED. SHOT as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly- fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. This is GORT. There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him. CLOSE SHOT - GORT From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot. MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed. CLOSE SHOT - GORT The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in a semicircle taking in all the troops. MED. SHOT - THE TROOPS SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced. ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh hysterically. A few break and run wildly. MED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot starts to reach out to grab him. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU lying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange language.
C: KLAATU
D: Gort! Deglet ovrosco!
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains that way. MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it are indications of small electronic gadgets.
C: KLAATU
D: It was a gift. For your President. With this he could have studied life on other planets.
E: glances at the broken object ruefully
N: Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain come into scene.
C: COLONEL
D: Is he all right?
E: to the lieutenants
C: FIRST PLATOON LEADER
D: Got hit in the shoulder, sir.
N: The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making his decision.
C: COLONEL
D: Send for an ambulance. Get him to Walter Reed Hospital right away.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Yes, sir.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT
N: There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse.
C: GENERAL
D: How is he?
E: to Major
C: MAJOR WHITE
D: He's all right, General... Blood pressure's a little high, but it could be aggravation.
C: GENERAL
D: Can't blame him. I always get mad when somebody shoots me.
E: wryly
C: MAJOR WHITE
D: He still wants to see the President.
C: COLONEL
D: We informed the White House over an hour ago.
E: to General
C: GENERAL
D: Didn't drop any hints about where he's from, did he?
E: to Major
C: MAJOR WHITE
D: No, sir, he didn't.
N: The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Excuse me. What about the reporters, Colonel? They're swarming all over the lobby.
E: to the Colonel
N: The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General.
C: GENERAL
D: Tell them there won't be any statement tonight.
E: quietly
C: CAPTAIN
D: Yes, sir. Mr. Harley's here from the White House.
E: glancing down the corridor
N: Harley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm. He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House secretariat. He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, nodding cordially to the General.
C: HARLEY
D: General --
C: GENERAL
D: Right in there, Mr. Harley.
E: indicating Klaatu's room
N: Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door. He knocks and then enters.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT
N: as Harley enters, closing the door behind him. Klaatu no longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the first time. Even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped in bandages, he is a figure of great authority. His face reflects inner dignity and assurance. Harley, who is a hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu. Harley obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he can. Klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved.
C: HARLEY
D: My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
E: Klaatu continues to study him silently
C: KLAATU
D: Just Klaatu.
E: coolly
C: HARLEY
D: The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
C: KLAATU
D: Sit down, Mr. Harley.
E: evenly
N: Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a half smile, hoping to ease the tension.
C: HARLEY
D: I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise. Had you been traveling long?
E: getting a little smile from Klaatu, he is encouraged to do some fishing
C: KLAATU
D: About five months -- your months.
C: HARLEY
D: You must have come a long way.
C: KLAATU
D: About 250 million of your miles.
N: Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. He's not.
C: HARLEY
D: Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
C: KLAATU
D: From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
E: easily; he's a diplomat, too
N: Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly corroborated.
C: HARLEY
D: It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
C: KLAATU
D: I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
C: HARLEY
D: The present situation?
E: eyebrows raised
C: KLAATU
D: I mean the reasons for my coming here.
C: HARLEY
D: We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
E: his eagerness apparent
C: KLAATU
D: I'd be glad to. Not now, of course -- with you alone.
E: noticing that Harley is settling himself expectantly
C: HARLEY
D: Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
C: KLAATU
D: This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
E: somewhat sharply
C: HARLEY
D: I -- I'm not sure I understand--
E: Startled by the scope of this statement
C: KLAATU
D: I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
C: HARLEY
D: I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
E: shocked and perturbed by this notion
C: KLAATU
D: I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
E: coolly
C: HARLEY
D: You know about the United Nations?
E: Surprised and a little puzzled
C: KLAATU
D: We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
C: HARLEY
D: You must have a rather strange impression of us.
E: wryly
C: KLAATU
D: The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
E: smiling
N: Harley smiles. Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of the situation and he speaks gravely.
C: HARLEY
D: I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
C: KLAATU
D: I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
E: evenly
C: HARLEY
D: I was only hoping to make you understand.
C: KLAATU
D: My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
E: sternly, impressively
C: HARLEY
D: Perhaps if you could explain a little--
E: uncomfortably
C: KLAATU
D: I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously. How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
E: his manner precludes opposition
N: Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of argument.
C: HARLEY
D: We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
E: after a long thoughtful moment
C: KLAATU
D: Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
C: HARLEY
D: Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
E: helplessly, but patiently
N: Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.
C: KLAATU
D: I don't want to resort to threats, Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake... I suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth.
N: The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then Harley rises quietly.
C: HARLEY
D: I will make that recommendation to the President. I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
E: he picks up his brief case and hat
C: KLAATU
D: Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
E: with a half-smile
C: HARLEY
D: I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have. Goodnight, sir.
E: he bows
N: He turns and goes out. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU He stares after Harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange and apparently unreasoning world he has come to. He shakes his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. SPACE SHIP - LONG SHOT - NIGHT
N: Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space ship and Gort. A circle of soldiers guard the area, while a crew of men can be seen working around the ship. MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT SHIP A Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is inspecting the side of the ship carefully. He has an acetylene torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face. The Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, enters and speaks to the Sergeant.
C: GENERAL
D: Getting any place, Sergeant?
C: SERGEANT
D: No, sir. Beats me, General. I saw that ramp come out of the side of the ship -- right here. Now I can't even find a crack!
E: raising his helmet shaking his head in annoyance
N: A man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes into scene. The General nods to him.
C: GENERAL
D: What's the report, Carlson?
C: CARLSON
D: We've tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill.
E: discouraged
C: GENERAL
D: What about him?
E: nodding toward Gort
C: CARLSON
D: He's made out of the same stuff.
N: THREE SHOT  GENERAL, CARLSON AND SERGEANT
C: GENERAL
D: Has he moved?
C: SERGEANT
D: No sir. Not an inch
C: CARLSON
D: This is the toughest material I ever saw, General. For hardness and strength, it's out of this world.
C: GENERAL
D: I can tell you officially - that's where it came from.
E: with a wry half-smile
N: The two men exchange an uneasy glance, then turn to look at the ship.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SITTING ROOM  WALTER REED HOSPITAL
N: Two Medical Corps officers, a Captain and a Major are interestedly studying a series of X-ray films.
C: MAJOR
D: The skeletal structure is completely normal. Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
E: pointing
C: CAPTAIN
D: And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure. How old do you think he is?
E: nodding, toward Klaatu's room
C: MAJOR
D: Oh, I'd say forty-five.
C: CAPTAIN
D: He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
E: smiling
C: MAJOR
D: I don't believe it.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
C: MAJOR
D: How does he explain that?
C: CAPTAIN
D: He says their medicine is that much more advanced. He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
E: the major stares at him blankly
N: The door to Klaatu's rooms opens and Major White appears. He's the man who attended Klaatu the day before. He closes the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other two, his face wearing a blank expression.
C: MAJOR WHITE
D: I took a bullet out of that man's arm yesterday.
C: FIRST MAJOR
D: What about it?
C: MAJOR WHITE
D: I just examined the wound and it's all healed.
E: utterly bewildered
C: FIRST MAJOR
D: What does he say about it?
C: MAJOR WHITE
D: Said he put some salve on it -- some stuff he had with him.
E: shows them a small, odd-looking tube in his hand
C: CAPTAIN
D: What are you going to do with it?
C: MAJOR WHITE
D: Take it downstairs and have it analyzed. Then I don't know whether I'll just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine.
E: on his way to the door, shaking his head
N: As he starts out the door to the corridor, he passes Mr. Harley, who is on his way in, carrying his ever-present brief case. Harley is accompanied by an enlisted M.P.
C: FIRST MAJOR
D: Afternoon, Mr. Harley.
C: HARLEY
D: Afternoon, gentlemen.
N: Harley goes to the door of Klaatu's room, a businesslike expression on his face. He knocks on the door, then enters. The M.P. remains in the sitting room.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT - DAY
N: as Harley enters. Klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in a Medical Corps robe and pajamas. He appears to be completely recovered.
C: HARLEY
D: Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you up and around.
E: surprised not to find him in bed
C: KLAATU
D: Thank you... Have you any news?
C: HARLEY
D: Not very good news, I'm afraid. The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night. Let me read you some of the replies. "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow." "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington." Well -- there you have it.
E: digs into his briefcase for some papers grimly he selects a cable and reads with a grimly-pointed glance at Klaatu, Harley reads another cable he looks up at Klaatu and shrugs
N: Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital, first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. Conscious of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably.
C: HARLEY
D: I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust-- Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
E: uneasily, under Klaatu's level gaze
C: KLAATU
D: It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
C: HARLEY
D: Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
C: KLAATU
D: I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations. I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
E: sternly sharply, bitterly
C: HARLEY
D: Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
C: KLAATU
D: I can judge only by what I see.
C: HARLEY
D: Your impatience is quite understandable.
C: KLAATU
D: I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
E: sharply
C: HARLEY
D: I'm afraid my people haven't. I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
E: ruefully with real sincerity
N: Reluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case. He finds Klaatu staring out the window. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU As he looks out the window thoughtfully. What he sees has given him an idea. MED. SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS shooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling about the hospital grounds. Most of them are civilian visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory patients. FULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM As Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, incisively.
C: KLAATU
D: Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
C: HARLEY
D: Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
N: Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by Klaatu's level gaze.
C: HARLEY
D: I must ask that you don't attempt to leave the hospital. Our military people have insisted on this. I'm sure you'll understand.
N: With a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange indeed.
S: INT. SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR
N: Harley has paused to watch as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door.

N: In the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication. She is accompanied by the same M.P. as previously seen. The nurse pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door. To his surprise he finds that the door is not locked. He exchanges a glance with the nurse, then pulls the door open and hurries inside.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
N: as the M.P. crosses the unlighted room toward the bed. The only light cones from the open door to the sitting room. The M.P.'s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed. It is unmade and unoccupied. Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is standing in the doorway. M.P. He's gone! The M.P. dashes out of the room, through the doorway past the nurse. She turns to follow him as we--

S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT
N: CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.
C: RADIO VOICES
D: --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital refused to comment on how he managed to escape, or what measures might be taken to apprehend him.
E: over scene
N: --these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of arms-- --there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power. The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and to remain calm, as we await further developments-- --three separate reports of people who claim to have seen the "space man" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa; one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago. CAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped to look at something out of scene. CLOSE SHOT from Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, reading: ROOM FOR RENT CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it. INSERT - TICKET It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to clothing. Printed on it is the legend: CAPITOL DRY CLEANING SERVICE. Scrawled in a penciled hand is the notation: Dr. Carpenter, Bldg. A - Walter Reed Hospital. Cl. & pr. $1. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU He smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit, and he destroys the ticket. He glances down at the suitcase beside him. CLOSE SHOT - SUITCASE It bears the initials L.M.C. Klaatu's hand comes into scene and lifts up the suitcase. CAMERA HOLDS as Klaatu carries the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the entrance.
S: INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from the hall. Gathered around a television set are five adults and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light from the screen. The room is done in average boardinghouse style -- antimacassars and all. The attention of the people is riveted on the television screen, where a newscaster is reading a bulletin.
C: TELEVISION COMMENTATOR
D: --while the President made no effort to minimize the crisis, he urged people all over the country to remain calm. He said the entire facilities of FBI and other federal agencies are being bought to bear. He pointed out, however, that this is no ordinary man hunt. He warned we may be up against powers that are beyond our control.
N: FULL SHOT The landlady, a stern-faced woman of middle age, named MRS. CROCKETT, rises nervously and crosses to the television set.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: I can't stand any more of this. It's enough to drive a person crazy.
E: tensely
N: She snaps off the set sharply. TWO SHOT BOBBY BENSON, a bright-eyed, eleven-year-old, is seated beside his mother, HELEN BENSON, an attractive girl of thirty. Disappointed that the set has been turned off, Bobby's roving eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall... Wide-eyed, he nudges his mother and points.
C: BOBBY
D: Hey, Mom -- who's that?
N: FULL SHOT including the doorway to the hall. Silhouetted motionless against the light from the hall is the figure of a man. All eyes follow Hobby's pointed finger, and there is a stifled gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation. One of the men turns on the lights and Klaatu is revealed standing calmly in the doorway. There is a shocked silence for a moment, then Mrs. Crockett speaks.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: I -- I'm sorry. What is it you want?
E: apologizing nervously for the tension in the room
C: KLAATU
D: My name is Carpenter. I'm looking for a room.
N: There is a noticeable letdown in the general tension, during which Booby has been studying Klaatu, his imagination working overtime.
C: BOBBY
D: Are you an FBI man?
C: KLAATU
D: No -- I'm afraid not.
N: Helen has stepped forward to make Bobby desist.
C: BOBBY
D: Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
C: HELEN
D: I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
E: with an apologetic smile at Klaatu
N: Mrs. Crockett reverts to her role as landlady. She likes to think of her house as a home.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: This is Mrs. Benson, Mr. Carpenter. And little Bobby. Mr. and Mrs. Barley -- and Mr. Krull... I'm Mrs. Crockett.
E: starting the introductions with Helen with a smile that would split a brick indicating a middle- aged couple and a younger but more wizened man
N: There are polite noddings and how-do-you-do's. Mrs. Crockett is satisfied that she's established a cozy atmosphere.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: Well -- this is our little family. I have a very nice room on the second floor.
E: pleased to the point of challenge then, getting down to business
N: She leads the way toward the hall and Klaatu starts to follow, picking up his suitcase, when he is intercepted by Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: Can I help you look for the space man? Can I? I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
E: excitedly
C: HELEN
D: That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
E: good-naturedly, calming him down
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: We mustn't annoy Mr. Carpenter -- or he won't want to stay here. She goes on into the hall, followed by Klaatu, who has exchanged a polite smile with Helen.

S: INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel Heater's voice.
C: GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
D: --and so, this Sunday morning, we ask the question that's been plaguing; the entire nation for two days now: "Where is this creature and what is he up to?" If he can build a space ship that can fly to Earth -- and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns -- what other terrors can he unleash at will? ...Obviously we must find this monster. We must track him down like a wild animal and destroy him.
N: INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image reads: "Are We Long For This World?" (Gabriel Heater's voice continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.) CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU He is reading his paper with considerable interest. INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study the recently landed "Space Ship." CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying.
C: GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
D: But where would such a creature hide himself? Would he disappear into the north woods? Or would he slither off into the sewers of some great city?
N: Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously distasteful idea. GROUP SHOT AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES:
C: GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
D: There is grave danger -- everyone agrees to that. The question is what can we do to protect ourselves? What measures can we take that will--
N: During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in sharp annoyance.
C: MRS. BARLEY
D: George, I wish you'd turn that radio off. I'm trying to concentrate.
N: Mr. Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio.
C: MR. BARLEY
D: Why doesn't the Government do something -- that's what I want to know.
E: snorting, he tosses his paper down
C: MR. KRULL
D: What can they do? They're only people -- Just like us.
E: mildly
C: MR. BARLEY
D: People my foot! They're Democrats!
C: MR. KRULL
D: It's enough to give you the shakes. He's got that robot standing there -- ten-foot tall -- just waiting for orders to destroy us.
C: HELEN
D: This space man -- or whatever he is. We automatically assume he's a menace... Maybe he isn't at all.
E: thoughtfully
C: MR. BARLEY
D: Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't he come out in the open?
E: glaring at her for this silly notion
C: MR. KRULL
D: Yeah. Like the fella says: "What's he up to?"
E: indicating the radio
C: HELEN
D: Maybe he's afraid.
C: MRS. BARLEY
D: He's afraid!
E: with a derisive snort
C: HELEN
D: After all, he was shot the moment he landed here. I was just wondering what I would do.
E: she pauses for a moment thoughtfully
C: KLAATU
D: Perhaps before deciding on a course of action, you'd want to know more about the people here -- to orient yourself in a strange environment.
E: to Helen, helpfully
C: MRS. BARLEY
D: There's nothing strange about Washington, Mr. Carpenter.
E: sharply
C: KLAATU
D: A person from another planet might disagree with you.
E: quietly, tongue in cheek
C: MRS. BARLEY
D: If you want my opinion, he came from right here on Earth. And you know where I mean.
E: with significant emphasis
C: MR. KRULL
D: They wouldn't come in a space ship. They'd come in airplanes.
C: MRS. BARLEY
D: I wouldn't be so sure about that.
E: as though with superior knowledge
C: MR. BARLEY
D: Stands to reason that fella wants some thing or he wouldn't be here. That make sense, Carpenter?
E: delivering the final word facing Klaatu
N: Klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly.
C: KLAATU
D: I must admit I'm a little confused.
N: Mrs. Crockett enters and speaks to Helen.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: Mrs. Benson -- Mr. Stevens is here to see you.
C: HELEN
D: Oh -- thank you.
N: She rises and goes out.
C: MRS. BARLEY
D: Finish your coffee, George. I told the Carsons we'd be there at eleven.

N: as Helen crosses the room to greet TOM STEVENS. He's a personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable charm. There is between them an easy air of Intimacy.
C: HELEN
D: Good morning.
E: smiling warmly
N: Tom kisses her.
C: TOM
D: We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
C: HELEN
D: There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby. I don't suppose we could take him with us?
E: a little disturbed tentatively
C: TOM
D: Well, we could--
E: understandably unenthusiastically
C: HELEN
D: There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
C: KLAATU'S VOICE
D: I haven't any plans.
N: Helen and Tom turn in surprise. THREE SHOT including Klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, unnoticed by Tom and Helen. Klaatu continues, with an air of wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere.
C: KLAATU
D: I'd be glad to spend the day with him -- if you'd let me.
C: TOM
D: Say, that'll be great! Wouldn't it, Helen.
E: impulsively
C: HELEN
D: It's awfully nice of you to suggest it. I'm sorry Mr. Carpenter -- this is Tom Stevens.
E: hesitating, a little confused, by the offer remembering the two men haven't met
N: The two men shake hand's and exchange how-do-you-do's. Then Klaatu turns back to Helen.
C: KLAATU
D: Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday afternoon. We talked -- and listened to the radio. I thought today he might show me around the city.
E: smiling at Helen
N: Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because of her favorable impression of Klaatu.
C: KLAATU
D: Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it.
E: easily

D: About a thousand miles an hour?
N: Klaatu has noticed the two men, who have edged a little closer to listen. He is not perturbed by them, but he lowers his voice a bit.

D: Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
C: BOBBY
D: Gee! How could they make a landing?
E: excitedly
C: KLAATU
D: Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
N: Klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going too far. The two men have moved closer, listening and grinning. One of them whispers to the other behind the back of his hand. Then the man realizes that Klaatu has stopped speaking and is looking at him.
C: MAN
D: Keep goin', Mister. He was fallin' for it.
E: grinning
N: The two men burst out laughing and move off together. Bobby, who has missed the point of this by-play, looks at Klaatu, then after the men. As they move out of scene they laugh loudly at the little boy's confusion. Klaatu takes Bobby's hand to lead him away from the roped-off area. TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they move away through the crowd. As they do so, several newsboys are working their way through the crowd with newly arrived extras. The boys are calling out the extras: "Police under fire!" "Army put in charge!" "Space man still at large!" etc. People are eagerly buying the papers. Klaatu and Booby watch this as they pass through the crowd. CLOSE SHOT - EXTRA In newsboy's hand. The headline reads: SPACE MAN ELUDES POLICE ARMY PUT IN CHARGE. CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER EXTRA In another newsboy's hand. This headline reads: DISTRICT UNDER MARTIAL LAW. CONGRESS ACTS AS POLICE CHIEF REIGNS.

The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and diagrams. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and he studies it with great interest and curiosity. MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD It is covered with a particularly complicated series of equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; they have no answers after the "equals" sign. Across are little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't erase!" and "Don't touch!" TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a child to solve a problem in arithmetic.

D: What does that mean?
E: indicating the equations
C: KLAATU
D: It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

E: he shakes his head, smiling
N: Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away with a disappointed but philosophical shrug.
C: BOBBY
D: We probably couldn't get to see him even if he was home.
N: As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts his hand on the knob. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees.
C: BOBBY
D: Hey -- where you going?
E: in complete surprise
N: CHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret amusement. He's got an idea.

S: EXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE
N: An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA. Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ). Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a stern voice is heard off screen.
C: HILDA'S VOICE
D: What are you doing in here?
N: FULL SHOT as Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise. Standing in the open French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion.
C: HILDA
D: How dare you write on that blackboard! Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
E: outraged by Klaatu's desecration of the sacred blackboard Klaatu eyes her mildly
C: KLAATU
D: He'll catch on to it in no time now.
E: pleasantly
C: HILDA
D: How did you get in here? And what do you want?
E: controlling herself with an effort
C: KLAATU
D: We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
C: HILDA
D: Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening. I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
E: sternly
C: KLAATU
D: You might keep this. I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
E: with easy assurance
N: With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.
C: KLAATU
D: I wouldn't erase that. The Professor needs it very badly.
E: pointing to the blackboard
N: And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts dialing a number.
S: EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT
N: as Klaatu and Bobby come down the steps and turn into the sidewalk. They are talking and laughing together, but we can't hear their conversation. CAMERA PANS with them as they move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch. Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by. Then, having passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed hop that characterizes the game.
S: INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY
N: Hilda is talking on the phone.
C: HILDA
D: --no, Sergeant, there was no classified material around, but I have instructions to report anything unusual to the police... Yes -- I'm Professor Barnhardt's secretary. The man's name is Carpenter -- and he lives at 1615 St. Street, N.W... Yes, that's right--
E: consulting the paper in her hand
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY
N: Bobby and Klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into infinity. They pause for a moment, then Bobby leads the way through one of the rows.
S: EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - CLOSE SHOT
N: in one of the many rows are crosses that extend beyond CAMERA RANGE. CAMERA MOVES IN on one of the crosses. It bears the name LT. ROBERT BENSON. TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND B0BBY as they come into scene and look down at the grave.
C: BOBBY
D: That's my father. He was killed at a place called Anzio.
E: Klaatu glances at the boy, then nods understandingly
N: Klaatu's glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows of crosses, and his eyes are sad as they return to Bobby.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - MED. SHOT - DAY
N: Klaatu and Bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway overhung with trees. Bobby leads the way to the bench and they sit down. Klaatu's eyes stray out to the myriad crosses.
C: KLAATU
D: Did all these people die in wars?
E: Reflectively
C: BOBBY
D: Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
E: somewhat surprised
C: KLAATU
D: No -- I'm afraid not.
C: BOBBY
D: Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
E: very serious
C: KLAATU
D: I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
E: Amused
C: BOBBY
D: Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
E: indicating the cemetery
C: KLAATU
D: They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
E: slowly
N: Bobby looks at him, puzzled and impressed by this incomprehensible notion.
C: BOBBY
D: Gee -- that's a good idea.
N: His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses. Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look of curiosity, and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject.
C: KLAATU
D: What would you like to do this afternoon?
N: After a moment Bobby's expression changes and he breaks into a broad grin.
C: BOBBY
D: Go to the movies.
C: KLAATU
D: All right.
C: BOBBY
D: No foolin'? Will you?
E: he didn't dare hope for this
C: KLAATU
D: Certainly. Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
E: then he hesitates
N: Bobby gives him a look of amazement, then grins, assuming Klaatu was kidding and simply hasn't any money.
C: BOBBY
D: I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
E: eagerly
C: KLAATU
D: No -- I want to take you to the movies. Do you think they'd accept these?
E: he takes some objects out of his pocket
N: CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU'S HAND Sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various sizes. TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY The boy is staring at the stones in wide-eyed amazement.
C: BOBBY
D: Gee -- those look like diamonds!
C: KLAATU
D: Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
C: BOBBY
D: Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
E: staring at them fascinated
C: KLAATU
D: Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
C: BOBBY
D: Well, sure, but--
E: with a nervous, unsure smile
N: The boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a jackknife for an ocean liner.
C: BOBBY
D: Okay.
E: slowly
N: The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost challengingly. Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two good-sized Diamonds. They study their new acquisitions with interest. Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty glance at Klaatu.
C: BOBBY
D: Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
C: KLAATU
D: Why not, Bobby?
E: mildly curious
C: BOBBY
D: She doesn't like me to steal from people.
E: gravely
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT
N: Shooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and stops in front of the boardinghouse. A Detective in plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver to pull up the street a way and wait. The Driver nods and the car moves off as the Detective crosses the sidewalk to the boardinghouse.
S: EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: As the Detective mounts the steps he glances through a window into the living room. Klaatu can be seen reading to Bobby, who is perched happily on the arm of Klaatu's chair. The Detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell. There is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is opened and Bobby appears.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Mr. Carpenter come home yet?
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah -- he's right inside.
E: studying the man curiously
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BOARDINGHOUSE
C: DETECTIVE
D: Tell him I'd like to see him.
C: BOBBY
D: Mr. Carpenter--! Come on in.
E: calling out to the Detective
N: The Detective steps inside and Bobby closes the door, as Klaatu appears from the living room.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Your name Carpenter?
C: KLAATU
D: Yes. Oh -- I suppose Professor Barnhardt's looking far me.
E: puzzled that anyone should know him then recalling, with a smile of satisfaction
C: DETECTIVE
D: I been looking for you all afternoon.
E: dryly, with grim emphasis
S: EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT
N: An inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford, or Chevrolet -- drives up and stops in front of the house. Helen and Tom are in it.
S: INT. CONVERTABLE - TW0 SHOT - HELEN AND TOM
N: You get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight. Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her.
C: HELEN
D: It was a wonderful day.
E: fondly
C: TOM
D: You still haven't answered my question.
C: HELEN
D: You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
E: warmly sincere
C: TOM
D: The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
C: HELEN
D: You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
E: smiling
C: TOM
D: A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
N: With a smile and, a quick kiss, Helen gets out of the car.
C: HELEN
D: 'Night.
N: MED. SHOT as Helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house. In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom. He waves back and drives off slowly. Helen lets herself in with her key.
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - BOARDINGHOUSE
N: The Detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave with Klaatu as Helen enters. There is a moment of awkwardness and confusion as she glances, puzzled, at the Detective. Bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly.
C: BOBBY
D: Hi Mom!
C: HELEN
D: Hello, darling. Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
E: she kisses Bobby, then turns questioningly to Klaatu and the Detective
N: Klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in greeting and introduces the Detective.
C: KLAATU
D: Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
C: BOBBY
D: Mr. Brady's a cop.
E: Impressively
N: Helen glances quickly at the Detective, then at Klaatu, surprised and troubled. She turns to Bobby to cover her confusion.
C: HELEN
D: Did you have a nice day, dear?
E: to Bobby
C: BOBBY
D: Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
E: enthusiastically
C: KLAATU
D: We certainly did.
C: BOBBY
D: We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
C: HELEN
D: I don't know how to thank you.
E: moved and grateful, she's uneasy and concerned as she turns to Klaatu
C: KLAATU
D: I enjoyed every minute of it.
C: DETECTIVE
D: We better get goin', Mr. Carpenter.
E: with quiet insistence
N: As Klaatu nods and prepares to follow him, Bobby speaks to Klaatu.
C: BOBBY
D: Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
C: KLAATU
D: We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: Goodnight.
E: reluctantly
N: Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out. Helen watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong. Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs.
C: HELEN
D: Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
C: BOBBY
D: Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
E: he followers her, then hesitates
C: HELEN
D: I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
N: This satisfies him for the moment -- even though it doesn't satisfy Helen. He is climbing the stairs beside her.
C: BOBBY
D: We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
C: HELEN
D: Professor Barnhardt.
E: flashing him a puzzled, incredulous look
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
E: almost ignoring the interruption
C: HELEN
D: Of course, dear.
C: BOBBY
D: Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT
N: The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been picked up in the search for the space man are being screened by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up. MED. CLOSE SHOT Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks, toward the line of people they are screening. A nondescript, middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the cops flips through a card file.
C: FIRST COP
D: B.M. Alberts -- no prior arrests.
E: to the cop beside him
C: SECOND COP
D: No identification? Send him over to G-2.
E: to the vagrant the man shakes his head dully
N: The man is taken out of the line as CAMERA MOVES ON to the next desk, with another pair of cops and another line. A rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf of identification cards and papers on the desk.
C: BUSINESSMAN
D: My wife just arrived with my identification.
N: One of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods to the man.
C: THIRD COP
D: That'll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to bother you... Next.
N: CAMERA MOVES ON to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is flipping through a card file.
C: FOURTH COP
D: Cappo, John C? Two priors -- one for petty theft -- one for shoplifting.
E: the man nods
C: FIFTH COP
D: Okay, Jonny -- you can go.
E: waving the man away
C: MAN
D: Sometimes a record comes in handy.
E: with a nervous grin and he moves off
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, intelligent and businesslike.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
C: KLAATU
D: I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
N: The Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
E: sardonically
C: KLAATU
D: That's right.
E: pleasantly
C: LIEUTENANT
D: I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
E: quietly sharp and accusing
C: KLAATU
D: In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: But I suppose you know the answer.
E: growing impatient
C: KLAATU
D: It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
E: with a deprecating shrug
N: The lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to deal with this madman. He glances at a report on his desk, trying to control his impatience.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Your name's Carpenter -- that right? Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
E: Klaatu nods
C: KLAATU
D: No -- I'm afraid not.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Well, how do I know who you are?
C: KLAATU
D: You don't.
E: secretly amused
N: The Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed cop comes into the scene.
C: COP
D: Excuse me, Lieutenant -- The Doc says this man needs treatment right away.
E: pointing offscene
N: MED. SHOT A man about forty-five, bloodied and badly beaten, is being supported and half-carried by two policemen. A police doctor is guiding them to a doorway, near which is a sign INFIRMARY. The man is almost unconscious, incapable even of holding up his head. MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK
C: LIEUTENANT
D: What's the story?
C: COP
D: Some fella caught him lookin' in a window and figured he was the space man. The whole neighborhood went crazy and they ganged up on him. Would have killed him if we hadn't come along... Turns out he was just a prowler.
N: The Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob violence.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Okay -- book him and get him fixed up. Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
E: the cops nods and goes, and the Lieutenant growls as he turns back to Klaatu and the Detective
C: KLAATU
D: They would have killed this man?
E: appalled by what he has seen and heard
C: LIEUTENANT
D: People get hysterical enough, they do anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
E: gruffly impatiently
C: KLAATU
D: How long will that take?
E: pretending impatience, but actually growing concerned
C: LIEUTENANT
D: They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. Take him over to G2.
E: to the Detective
N: Really concerned now, Klaatu tries to find a way out. He attempts an authoritative air.
C: KLAATU
D: It's very important, Lieutenant, that I see Professor Barnhardt.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Come on, Mr. Carpenter--
N: Shaking off the Detective's hand, Klaatu speaks to the Lieutenant.
C: KLAATU
D: May I suggest that you call the Professor?
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
E: all patience gone
N: The Detective takes Klaatu's arm and leads him toward the door. As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE
N: as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off. MED. SHOT as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the curb, where a police car is standing. Parked just behind it is an Army staff car. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO POLICE STATION as the M.P. Captain appears in the entrance, accompanied by the Police Lieutenant. They see Klaatu and the Detective approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them. MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT POLICE CAR
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Wait a minute, Brady-- The Captain here's got orders from General Cutler to take this man over to Professor Barnhardt.
E: to the Detective indicating orders in his hand
C: M.P. CAPTAIN
D: Will you come with me, Sir?
E: to Klaatu firmly but respectfully
N: MED. SHOT as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts him toward the staff car. Passing the Lieutenant, Klaatu speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of mild triumph.
C: KLAATU
D: Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.
N: The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu, who steps into the Army vehicle, as we--
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: as the M.P. Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which is held open for then by Hilda. She gestures them toward the half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters with Klaatu.
S: INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY
N: Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, chalk in hand.
C: M.P. CAPTAIN
D: This is the man you wanted to see, Professor.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Thank you, Captain.
E: studying Klaatu curiously
C: M.P. CAPTAIN
D: I'll wait outside.
N: He steps out into the hall, closing the door. Barnhardt continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.
C: BARNHARDT
D: You wrote this?
C: KLAATU
D: It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see. I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
E: nodding easily glancing at the blackboard reproachfully
C: BARNHARDT
D: Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
N: Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the board. Then he points to one of the expressions in an equation.
C: KLAATU
D: All you have to do now is substitute this expression-- --at this point.
E: pointing to a specific place
N: Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he studies and weighs the results.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
E: slowly, thoughtfully
C: KLAATU
D: Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
C: BARNHARDT
D: How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
C: KLAATU
D: I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another. I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
E: with a slight smile Barnhardt stares at him blankly
C: BARNHARDT
D: As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
C: KLAATU
D: My name is Klaatu. I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday. If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
E: noting that Barnhardt's expression is changing from amazement to incredulity Klaatu waits for this to sink in, then speaks with quiet authority
N: Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside.
C: BARNHARDT
D: You can go now, Captain. Please thank General Cutler and tell him -- tell him that I know this gentleman.
E: to the Captain, his voice a little unsteady
N: Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying to adjust his mind.
C: KLAATU
D: You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
E: dryly
C: BARNHARDT
D: It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity. Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
E: unable to conceal his interest
C: KLAATU
D: I would like to explain something of my mission here.
E: ignoring the invitation
C: BARNHARDT
D: That was my first question.
C: KLAATU
D: It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society. We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
E: with some bitterness gathering his thoughts
C: BARNHARDT
D: Yes -- that is true.
C: KLAATU
D: In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people-- We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
E: he shrugs and shakes his head
C: BARNHARDT
D: If you mean that you are afraid of us--
E: puzzled
C: KLAATU
D: We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years. We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago. So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
E: with cool impressive emphasis indicating the telephone he paces thoughtfully
C: BARNHARDT
D: These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
E: thoughtful and impressed
C: KLAATU
D: We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago. After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
E: he smiles wryly
C: BARNHARDT
D: We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists. What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
E: with deep conviction Straightforwardly
C: KLAATU
D: I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Would you care to be more specific?
C: KLAATU
D: What I have to say must be said to all concerned. It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
E: evenly with a suggestion of deference to Barnhardt
N: Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.
C: BARNHARDT
D: I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
C: KLAATU
D: I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin. Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
E: sternly, as this unpleasant episode is recalled with Jovian annoyance
C: BARNHARDT
D: What -- what sort of action do you mean?
E: uneasily
C: KLAATU
D: Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand. Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
E: quietly
N: Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a moment, he turns to Klaatu.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
C: KLAATU
D: That's what I came to see you about.
E: quietly, evenly
N: Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the floor thoughtfully.
C: BARNHARDT
D: It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
C: KLAATU
D: I leave that in your hands.
C: BARNHARDT
D: You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
C: KLAATU
D: No -- not at all.
C: BARNHARDT
D: What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
C: KLAATU
D: My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
C: BARNHARDT
D: I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
E: smiling, but a little concerned
C: KLAATU
D: I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
C: BARNHARDT
D: One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
E: he suddenly pauses, thoughtfully
C: KLAATU
D: I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be-- --eliminated.
E: with a sense of quiet, inescapable power he looks for the right word
N: The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, his keen mind reeling.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Such power exists?
C: KLAATU
D: I assure you such power exists.
N: Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing again.
C: BARNHARDT
D: The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake. You mentioned a demonstration of force--
E: after a thoughtful moment, he looks up
C: KLAATU
D: Yes.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
C: KLAATU
D: Yes -- of course.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
C: KLAATU
D: That can easily be arranged.
E: with a nod
C: BARNHARDT
D: I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
E: frightened by his easy assumption of infinite power
C: KLAATU
D: Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
E: easily
C: BARNHARDT
D: Maybe a little demonstration.
E: with a nervous half- smile
C: KLAATU
D: Something dramatic -- but not destructive. It's quite an interesting problem. Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
E: thinking about it intellectually amused Barnhardt nods vaguely
N: Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing he'd never started this business.
T: FADE OUT:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT
N: It is about 3:30 the following evening. Helen is sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine. She is dressed to go out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining room and notices Helen.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: Going out, dear?
C: HELEN
D: Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me up.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: Personally, I won't go out after dark these days. But then -- I'm not courting, am I?
E: with a shudder with an attempt at slyness
N: She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been kibitzing the card game.
C: MRS. CROCKETT
D: Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!
E: thoroughly startled
N: Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining room. He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight smile.
C: KLAATU
D: Everyone seems so--
E: he shakes his hands to indicate nervousness
C: HELEN
D: Jittery is the word.
N: Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. She is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police.
C: KLAATU
D: Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
E: with a contemplative smile
C: HELEN
D: He has his homework to keep him occupied.
C: KLAATU
D: He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
E: fondly, sincerely
C: HELEN
D: Naturally I think so.
C: KLAATU
D: Warm and friendly and intelligent-- You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
E: thoughtfully
N: Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. She decides to face it.
C: HELEN
D: Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
E: hesitantly and with some difficulty
C: KLAATU
D: Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
E: with easy frankness
N: Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom. He appears impatient, anxious to get going.
C: HELEN
D: Hello--
C: TOM
D: You ready?
C: HELEN
D: I will be in just a minute.
C: TOM
D: The picture starts at eight-fifty.
E: a little annoyed that she hasn't her coat on, he consults his watch
C: HELEN
D: I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
E: in explanation
C: TOM
D: I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
E: lightly, but with real sarcasm underneath
N: Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed.
C: KLAATU
D: Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
C: HELEN
D: Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
E: guiltily
N: Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly.
C: KLAATU
D: Have a good time -- both of you.
N: He goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living room.
C: HELEN
D: Why don't you wait in here while I get my things?
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: As they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully.
C: HELEN
D: Oh, Tom, that was awful.
E: quietly
C: TOM
D: I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter. I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
E: momentary apologetic Helen shushes him
N: This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot answer.
C: HELEN
D: I'll go get my things.
N: She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff are women made.
S: INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
N: Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open.
S: INT. BOBBY'S ROOM
N: Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen enters, still putting on her coat.
C: KLAATU
D: All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
E: about to leave
C: BOBBY
D: Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
C: KLAATU
D: I'll say goodnight again.
E: to Helen, pleasantly
N: Helen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go about it.
C: HELEN
D: Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.
E: it's too complicated; she can't do it
C: KLAATU
D: Goodnight, my dear.
E: with a warm smile of complete understanding and appreciation
N: He turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, Helen turns to Bobby.
C: HELEN
D: Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
C: BOBBY
D: Okay.
N: Helen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.
C: HELEN
D: Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
E: hesitantly, almost guiltily
C: BOBBY
D: Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
E: shocked, and bewildered
C: HELEN
D: Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
C: BOBBY
D: Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
N: Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.
C: BOBBY
D: Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
E: shrewdly
C: HELEN
D: What do you mean, dear?
C: BOBBY
D: I mean -- on account of that policeman last night. You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
E: his eyes light up hopefully
C: HELEN
D: No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it. 'Night, darling.
E: she kisses him
N: With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door.
C: BOBBY
D: Goodnight. Hey Mom -- why would he want to be alone?
E: stopping her in the doorway, his imaginative suspicions mounting
N: Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu appears.
C: KLAATU
D: Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah -- sure. It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
E: surprised by his appearance and his request he goes to a drawer and gets a large hand flashlight
N: Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager curiosity.
C: BOBBY
D: What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
C: KLAATU
D: Why -- the light in my room went out. Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
E: evasively cutting off further questions
N: Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door a crack so he can peer out into the hall. MED. SHOT shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door. Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, still carrying the flashlight. MED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind him.

S: EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT
N: Klaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with the determined stride of a man with a definite objective. MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY Half a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed with a sense of excitement and adventure.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - NIGHT
N: Walking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, disappearing from view around the corner. In a moment, Bobby hurries into scene breathlessly. He pulls up for a moment to rest. Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner after Klaatu.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT
N: This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. ARMY. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU as he studies the situation. MED. SHOT shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver and the Jeep moves off. MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the foliage. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY puzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu. MED. CLOSE SHOT The two sentries standing in front of the building. MED. SHOT as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily barred. MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to see through the window. MED. SHOT - GORT shooting through the barred window into the building. The huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from the window. MED. CLOSE SHOT as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.) MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head turns to face the window. MED. SHOT from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light flashing its signals. MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment of the foliage. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. Suddenly he sees Klaatu again. MED. SHOT - KLAATU making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu waits and watches. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then back inside the building. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is amazed at what he sees. MED. SHOT from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way calmly toward the entrance of the building. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure.
S: INT. BUILDING - FULL SHOT
N: as Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren enclosure toward the ship.
S: EXT. ENTRANCE TO BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT
N: as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers.
S: EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT
N: In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently closes. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly away.
S: INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced engineering. MED. CLOSE SHOT as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--

S: INT. LIVING ROOM BOARDINGHOUSE NIGHT
N: Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come home. He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen precluded any such possibility. From the hall we hear the front door opening as Helen and Tom come in.

D: Why don't you come on in for a minute?
E: off scene
N: Helen and Tom appear in the doorway, Helen is startled to see Bobby, who has Jumped up and run toward her.

E: excitedly
C: HELEN
D: Tell me what?
C: BOBBY
D: I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
E: the words tadpole out breathlessly
C: HELEN
D: Now, Bobby, just a minute--
E: patiently disbelieving
C: BOBBY
D: Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!

D: That robot fella grabbed 'em and dragged 'em inside! I like Mr. Carpenter -- but I'm scared, Mom.
E: his lips trembling
N: He rushes into Helen's arms, clutching her desperately, trying to hold back his tears.
C: HELEN
D: Mustn't be frightened, darling -- It was just a bad dream. Here -- we'll prove it to you. Tom, will you ask Mr. Carpenter if he'll come down for a minute. The room right opposite mine.
E: holding him close to her sympathetically with a look and a nod to Tom Tom turns to go
N: Nodding, Tom disappears into the hall and up the stairs. Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an appeal to logic.
C: HELEN
D: Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
C: BOBBY
D: Yes, I have!
C: HELEN
D: You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.

C: BOBBY
D: I'd never call you a liar.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MED. CLOSE SHOT

S: INT. KLAATU'S ROOM - FULL SHOT
N: Tom snaps on the light and looks around the empty room. The bed is still made. Glancing around, Tom's eye is caught by a flash of something bright on the floor below the dresser. He stoops down and picks up a fair-sized diamond. Tom studies the stone curiously, holding it up to the light. Thoroughly puzzled, he keeps the stone in his hand, switches off the light and goes out. UPSTAIRS HALL - MED. SHOT Closing the door, Tom hurries along the hall and down the stairs

E: with the shrug of an amateur
C: BOBBY
D: Mr. Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds. He gave me a couple of them.
E: he digs into his pocket
N: Helen takes the two diamonds Bobby holds out in his hand, looking at them in amazement.
C: HELEN
D: He gave these to you?
C: BOBBY
D: Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
E: guilty for his own sharp dealing
C: TOM
D: This doesn't make sense... I think the guy's a crook. I never did trust him.
N: Helen tries to shush Tom, not wanting to re-stimulate Bobby's imagination, but it's too late.
C: BOBBY
D: Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
C: HELEN
D: Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
E: firmly
C: TOM
D: I wonder if we ought to--
C: HELEN
D: Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.

N: Without warning the elevator comes to a jolting, jarring stop as the power is cut off and the lights go out. The car is illuminated faintly and eerily by light that seeps through the ventilating grills from a skylight in the shaft. Helen is terrified.

S: INT. BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT - GORT -
N: NIGHT In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice- like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)
S: EXT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS
N: The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He turns and goes inside the door.
S: INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE SOLDIER
N: As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with terror. CLOSE SHOT - GORT Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight. His head is free now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which is dripping down the sides of the block. CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER He glances around nervously to see that his companion has entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug- eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly toward the robot. CLOSE SHOT - GORT The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures. MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS as they move toward Gort. CLOSE SHOT - GORT From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling. sound. And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out. After a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off. REVERSE SHOT from same angle as scene before last. But the two soldiers have utterly disappeared. FULL SHOT as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic. There is no sign of the two soldiers.

S: INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
N: as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but she realizes she can't. MED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly melting away. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, whose legs are still held captive. MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly toward Helen. MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him. MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the robot is closing in on her. MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream. TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms outstretched as though to grab or smash her. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver.
C: HELEN
D: Gort--! Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.
E: with desperate clarity
N: CLOSE SHOT - GORT He pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment. TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking toward the space ship. MED. SHOT PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes silently behind them.
S: INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

N: This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of mechanical noises. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear. FULL SHOT Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work. Then he moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him. Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none. Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door.

N: A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.
S: INT. CELL - POLICE STATION
N: This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption toward the body of Klaatu.
S: INT. JAIL CORRIDOR
N: Hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell. MED. SHOT shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the cell and look inside. There they see the giant robot picking up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the gaping hole in the side of the building. They raise their weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on him. Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT
N: as Gort enters the empty building, still carrying the body of Klaatu. CAMERA PANS with him as he strides over to the ship. The ramp opens and Gort goes inside. Then the ramp closes after him.
S: INT. LABORATORY CABIN IN SPACE SHIP
N: Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's wrist and ankle.
S: EXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT
N: shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the staff car as it roars away from the curb.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT
N: A good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests are still arriving. There is no one to greet them at the door, so they wander in and seat themselves.
S: INT. LABORATORY IN SPACE SHIP
N: Gort is still working over the body of Klaatu. From a socket in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the arm. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror. FULL SHOT Gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical cracklings and sputterings. Suddenly he flips a switch and all sound ceases. Gort removes the electrodes and watches Klaatu. CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu and we see him start to breathe. In a moment his eyelids flutter. Then his eyes open and he looks around. MED. CLOSE SHOT as Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. Helen watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though to orient himself. Then he lowers his feet to the floor and stands up. He blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them.
C: KLAATU
D: Hello.
E: with a grateful glance at Gort, he turns to Helen
C: HELEN
D: I -- I thought you were--
E: staring at him
C: KLAATU
D: I was.
E: nodding, with a smile
C: HELEN
D: You mean he has the power of life and death?
E: looking at Gort in awe
C: KLAATU
D: No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
C: KLAATU
D: This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
E: indicating the equipment Gort used
C: HELEN
D: But how -- how long--?
E: concerned for him
C: KLAATU
D: How long will I live? That no one can say.
E: he shrugs
N: Klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a suit of his "other world" clothing from behind the panel. With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change.
S: EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT
N: shooting from the door. In f.g. Barnhardt, who has just arrived, is greeting several friends outside the door. In b.g. a staff car and three or four other Army vehicles are driving up. MED. SHOT - ARMY VEHICLES As the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building, the Colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to Barnhardt. Barnhardt is motioning his friends into the building as the Colonel comes up to him. TWO SHOT - COLONEL AND BARNHARDT The Colonel speaks to Barnhardt with deference but with unyielding authority.
C: COLONEL
D: I'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- I have to ask you to call off this meeting.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Call it off? I... But I had permission from the Army--
C: COLONEL
D: I know you did. But the robots on the loose now and it isn't safe around here. You'll have to get your friends out of that building.
S: INT. SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN
N: as Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he has changed into his "other world" tunic.
C: KLAATU
D: Gort and I will be leaving soon.
N: Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth of feeling between these two.
C: HELEN
D: We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I. He won't have anyone to play with.
E: simply, sincerely smiling to conceal her real feelings
C: KLAATU
D: He'll have you -- and Tom.
C: HELEN
D: No. That's all finished.
E: quietly -- definitely
C: KLAATU
D: I'm sorry.
C: HELEN
D: I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
E: she is sensible and objective, but not unfeeling
N: Klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His voice comes in the ship through a speaker.
C: BARNHARDT
D: Ladies and Gentlemen--
S: INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT
N: He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible disappointment in his voice.
C: BARNHARDT
D: I called you from your work and from your homes all over the world because we were to meet here tonight with a man from another planet -- the man who came here in this ship. As you all know, this is no longer possible. I can only say that I share the bitterness of your disappointment.
E: there are audible exclamations of surprise and disappointment
N: INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders of social and political thought. There are several women among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every important world power is represented.
S: INT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP
N: Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him.
C: KLAATU
D: Gort -- berengo.
N: Gort moves off obediently.
S: INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT
N: Full of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting.
C: BARNHARDT
D: --under the circumstances, the Army people have asked us to leave the building. And, since their concern is for our safety, I can do nothing but suggest that we comply--
N: Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of the space ship. MED. SHOT - BARNHARDT'S AUDIENCE as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden gasp of terror. MED. SHOT - AT SHIP as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp. MED. CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu and he's debating what he should do. MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. He turns to look out at the audience, which is held spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks.
C: KLAATU
D: I am leaving soon and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly. The Universe grows smaller every day -- and the threat of aggression by any group -- anywhere -- can no longer be tolerated.
E: straightforwardly, with almost stern authority he pauses, studying the faces
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE of three of the delegates, listening intently. (These three are from Russia, India and France.)
C: KLAATU'S VOICE
D: There must be security for all -- or no one is secure... This does not mean giving up any freedom except the freedom to act irresponsibly.
E: over scene
N: CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE He is an American.
C: KLAATU'S VOICE
D: Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves -- and hired policemen to enforce them.
E: over scene
N: CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
C: KLAATU
D: We of the other planets have long accepted this principle. We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets -- and for the complete elimination of aggression. A sort of United Nations on the Planetary level... The test of any such higher authority, of course, is the police force that supports it. For our policemen, we created a race of robots-- Their function is to patrol the planets -- in space ships like this one -- and preserve the peace. In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us.
E: indicating Gort
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression. The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement.
C: KLAATU'S VOICE
D: At the first sign of violence they act automatically against the aggressor. And the penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk.
E: over scene
N: CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
C: KLAATU
D: The result is that we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war -- free to pursue more profitable enterprises. We do not pretend to have achieved perfection -- but we do have a system -- and it works. I came here to give you the facts. It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet -- but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.
E: after a pause with straightforward candor
T: QUICK REACTION CUTS
N: of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment. And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying. MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly, incisively.
C: KLAATU
D: Your choice is simple. Join us and live in peace. Or pursue your present course -- and face obliteration. We will be waiting for your answer. decision rests with you.
E: after a pause
N: By the time he reads the last line, the CAMERA HAS MOVED INTO a BIG HEAD CLOSEUP. MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES CAMERA MOVES along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they have heard. MED. SHOT CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at the building as he does so.
C: KLAATU
D: Gort -- veracto.
N: CLOSE SHOT - GORT He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we hear the peculiar generating sound from within him. MED. LONG SHOT including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the building. MED. SHOT AT SHIP Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up the ramp and disappears inside the ship. Klaatu is nodding goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen. TWO SHOT - BARNHARDT AND HELEN as they wave to Klaatu. Barnhardt is moved and impressed, and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU He nods and smiles at them with warm affection. Then he turns and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind him. MED. SHOT - THE SPACE SHIP From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a tremendous dynamo. MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and seen. MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great ship takes off with a tremendous roar.
T: REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES
N: All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces from which it came.
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
