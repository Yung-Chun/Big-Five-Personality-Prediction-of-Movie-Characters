T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
N: An afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches. The garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a high brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building. CLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the garden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works slowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings. This man is called CHANCE. Chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening skies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of his pitchfork.
S: INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
N: The sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage from the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a wall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf, carefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the car for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the garage through a side entry.
S: INT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: The Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener, everything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A small, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a shelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA. Attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing colored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of color TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the television set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the pitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and leaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues.
S: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: A room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote control color television set dominates the room. It is on, tuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with expensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books, magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be seen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as he removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a laundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like quality. Chance changes the channel once again.
S: EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
N: Chance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the warmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the furniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: A large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs. It is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and place setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to the place setting. Chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near the doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the TV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as he watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters with a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry.
C: LOUISE
D: ... Evening, Chance.
E: sets dinner before Chance
C: CHANCE
D: ... Good evening, Louise.
E: slowly, perfect diction, no accent of any kind
N: Louise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks up his laundry bag.
C: LOUISE
D: ... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
C: CHANCE
D: I see.
E: begins to eat
C: LOUISE
D: I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
N: Chance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the TV as he eats. A buzzer SOUNDS, Louise looks upstairs.
C: LOUISE
D: ... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Is his back feeling better?
E: still watches TV
N: Louise gives Chance a look.
C: LOUISE
D: ... Gobbledegook... You and your gobbledegook. You're gonna be the death of me yet, Chance... ... Unless those stairs are... The Good Lord's liable to snatch up two unwillin' souls at the same time if I keep on trampin' up those stairs... I don't want none of that...
E: she turns to leave
N: Louise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to eat and watch TV.
S: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
N: Chance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open, and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on the TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer, checks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never straying from an early morning show on television. He puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room.
S: INT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN
N: Chance enters, turns on the TV with the spinning color wheel, then waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. He turns off the TV and exits.
S: INT. GARAGE - DAWN
N: Chance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the touring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. He leaves the garage.
S: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
N: Chance returns to his room, changes channels on the television, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the closet, then goes into the bathroom.
S: EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
N: A light snow is falling. The door to the small building opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside. A few seconds pass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella. Smartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main house.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella before entering. He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then heads for the dining room.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
N: Repeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits, turns on the TV, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. He watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting Louise. She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches TV. After a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying down the stairs. She comes into the dining room, visibly distraught. Chance looks up, smiles.
C: CHANCE
D: Good morning, Louise.
C: LOUISE
D: He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
E: out of breath
C: CHANCE
D: ... I see.
E: flatly, turns back to TV
C: LOUISE
D: Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I've seen that done.
E: nodding
C: LOUISE
D: Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
C: CHANCE
D: ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
E: watches news, flashes of season's first snowfall
N: A beat of silence from Louise, then anger.
C: LOUISE
D: Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook? That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
E: Chance smiles, is silent
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
E: with a smile, accepting death
C: LOUISE
D: Well, ain't that the truth...
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It is.
N: Louise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and sits, softening a bit toward him.
C: LOUISE
D: Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ... ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
E: Chance doesn't react, watches TV
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I'm very hungry.
E: a turn to her
C: LOUISE
D: Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess... ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
E: rises, looks upstairs she starts out, stops by the door
C: CHANCE
D: I'm going to work in the garden.
E: gazing at TV
N: Louise gives Chance a long look, then turns to leave.
C: LOUISE
D: ... I'll get you some eggs.
E: as she goes
N: Chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the TV.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING
N: An enclosed stairway. Chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase. He moves off down the hall.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING
N: The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the Old Man is. There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance enters the room. As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed, we sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit of curiosity. Chance stands by the side of the bed for a moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back from the Old Man's face. He touches the man's forehead, lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. Chance moves to the TV (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. He sits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a movie from the early forties. Chance puts an arm out, rests it on the Old Man's covered body. With the other, he changes the channels with the remote control. He returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat to a lady. The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.
S: EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
N: It has stopped snowing. Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. Louise comes out of the main house. She is dressed warmly, a scarf over her head, a heavy coat. Chance sees her, tips his hat to Louise exactly like the man he saw on television.
C: LOUISE
D: ... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'... ... gotta go now, Chance...
E: a pause
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
E: resumes working
C: LOUISE
D: You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy... ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance... But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours... ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you? ... Goodbye, Chance...
E: he keeps working she smiles slightly, with caring she reaches out, puts a hand on his shoulder he smiles, keeps working
N: Louise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward the house.
C: CHANCE
D: Goodbye, Louise.
E: as she goes
N: Louise waves as she enters the townhouse. Chance tips his hat once again as she disappears.
S: INT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases waiting by the door. She stops as she sees TWO MEN in white carrying a stretcher down the main staircase. She notices the ease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the stairs.
C: LOUISE
D: ... He used to be a big man... 'Spose he wasted away to about nothin'... ... I guess I'll be goin' off to find me some folks, Old Man... I'm not batty enough to stay around this neighborhood any longer...
E: a beat - then she talks to the body of the old Man
N: The stretcher bearers move to the front door. Louise steps in front of them.
C: LOUISE
D: Wait up! I'm goin' out that door first.
E: CONT'D to stretcher bearers
N: Louise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens the front door, leaves.
S: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAY
N: The TV plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom. He finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves the room.
S: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
N: Chance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of fresh snow to the townhouse.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place. He turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not appear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views a wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement, he again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage of the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign dignitaries at the White House. CLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a two-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously, Chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming to have 'sunk into' his mind.
S: INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY
N: A key is heard in the lock. The door opens and THOMAS FRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter. Franklin, an attorney, is in his late thirties, carries a large briefcase. Hayes is younger, attractive, also an attorney. She totes a briefcase, has the look of a modern, liberated woman. Hayes appears to be surprised at the interior of the house.
C: HAYES
D: ... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
E: looks around
C: FRANKLIN
D: Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
C: HAYES
D: ... Would you take me on a tour?
C: FRANKLIN
D: Gladly... ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
E: he smiles
N: Franklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down the hall.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Chance still watches TV, waits for Louise to serve him. Franklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room. They are both surprised to see Chance.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... Why... Hello, we thought we heard something... I'm Thomas Franklin.
E: moves to Chance, hand outstretched
N: Chance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both of his like the President did on TV.
C: CHANCE
D: Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... The gardener? ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
E: a beat thinks it's a joke, laughs
N: Hayes moves to shake Chance's hand.
C: HAYES
D: Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
E: doesn't rise, again shakes with both hands
N: Chance turns back to the TV and Hayes and Franklin exchange looks.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
E: after an uneasy pause
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Thomas - I understand.
E: a smile, totally at ease
N: Another period of silence. Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Louise?... The maid?... But she should have left earlier today...
E: a look to Hayes
C: CHANCE
D: I see...
E: smiles at Hayes
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
E: a beat
C: CHANCE
D: I live here.
C: FRANKLIN
D: You live here? ... We don't have any record of that.
E: a look to Hayes
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... How long have you been living here?
E: a beat
C: CHANCE
D: Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Since you were a child?
E: doubting
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
C: HAYES
D: ... Then you really are a gardener?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
C: HAYES
D: Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
C: CHANCE
D: Oh. Thank you.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
C: CHANCE
D: No.
C: FRANKLIN
D: How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
C: CHANCE
D: Compensated...?
C: FRANKLIN
D: How were you paid?
C: CHANCE
D: I was given meals, and a home...
C: HAYES
D: What about money?
C: CHANCE
D: I never needed money.
N: Franklin steps to the TV, turns it off.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
C: CHANCE
D: No, I do not have any of those.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
C: CHANCE
D: I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... Joe? Who's Joe?
C: CHANCE
D: Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
E: turns TV back on
C: FRANKLIN
D: 1952...?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
E: changes channels
C: HAYES
D: Some pictures...?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Of men and women.
C: HAYES
D: ... Oh.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.

D: You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
N: Franklin and Hayes exchange looks.

C: HAYES
D: You never been in a car?
E: amazed
N: Chance is silent for a moment, he blushes slightly.

C: FRANKLIN
D: ... What do you make of all this?
E: quietly
C: HAYES
D: I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... Yeah...
E: looks at Chance
C: HAYES
D: ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
C: FRANKLIN
D: Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure... ... Let's just keep everything legal.
E: he unzips briefcase
N: Franklin takes out some papers, approaches Chance.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
C: CHANCE

E: does not understand
C: FRANKLIN
D: Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.

C: FRANKLIN
D: Come now, Mr. Chance.
C: CHANCE
D: I have no claim, Thomas.
E: smiles
C: FRANKLIN
D: But you won't sign, correct?
C: CHANCE
D: Correct.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
C: CHANCE

S: EXT. FRONT OF TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: Chance stops short on the front steps; the townhouse is situated in a decaying ghetto. The snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows shattered, are smeared with grafitti. Chance tries to return to the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked. He stands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash laden sidewalk. He stops, ponders which way to go, finally makes up his mind and moves off to his left.
S: EXT. GHETTO STREET - AFTERNOON
N: The buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street. A group of Black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed furniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for warmth. Chance rounds the corner, walks up to them. He stands by them, smiles. They stare back, no sign of friendship in their faces. Chance nods politely to them, then walks away down the sidewalk.
S: EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
N: A group of eight to ten hard-core ghetto youths hang out on a corner. Other passersby give them a wide berth, they are unapproachable. Chance nears the group, approaches.
C: CHANCE
D: ... Excuse me, would you please tell me where I could find a garden to work in?
E: friendly
N: They turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this White trespasser would intrude on their jiving.
C: CHANCE
D: ... There is much to be done during the winter, I must start the seeds for the spring, I must work the soil...
E: CONT'D after a beat
N: One of the Black youths, LOLO, interrupts Chance.
C: LOLO
D: What you growin', man?
N: The leader of the gang, ABBAZ, shuts up Lolo with an elbow and moves menacingly forward.
C: ABBAZ
D: ... What you doin' here, boy?
E: nose to nose with Chance
C: CHANCE
D: I had to leave my garden. I want to find another.
C: ABBAZ
D: Bullshit. Who sent you here, boy? Did that chickenshit asshole Raphael send you here, boy?
C: CHANCE
D: No. Thomas Franklin told me that I had to leave the Old Man's house, he's dead now, you know...
C: ABBAZ
D: Dead, my ass! Now get this, honkie - you go tell Raphael that I ain't takin' no jive from no Western Union messenger! You tell that asshole, if he got somethin' to tell me to get his ass here himself! You got that, boy?
E: edges closer to Chance
N: Chance smiles at Abbaz and reaches into his pocket.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I understand. If I see Raphael I will tell him.
E: he takes out his remote control TV changer
N: Chance points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times, tries to change the picture. Abbaz immediately pulls out a switchblade, whips the blade open.
C: ABBAZ
D: Now, move, honkie! Before I cut your white ass!
E: holds knife at Chance
N: Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns it to his pocket.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Of course. Good day.
E: as he leaves
N: Abbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz with excitement: "Who the fuck died?" "Why'd he pull that changer on us, man?" "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!" "He's some weird honkie, man."

N: A street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and strip joints. An elderly Black woman approaches carrying a bag of groceries. Chance steps in front of the woman, stops her.
C: CHANCE
D: I'm very hungry now. Would you please bring me my lunch?
N: The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened. She turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety. Chance watches after her for a moment, then continues along.
S: EXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
N: Chance stands looking through a chain-link fence watching some teenage boys playing basketball. He bangs on the fence, calls to them.

N: The boys ignore him, Chance walks away.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street. He seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side. In the background can be seen the Washington Monument.
S: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Chance seems stumped on which way to go. He looks up one street, then the other, has no idea where they lead. He turns, looks behind him and sees a large statue of Benito Juarez pointing. Chance smiles and goes off in the direction that Benito points.
S: EXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK
N: Tourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the White House. Chance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a dying tree. Chance moves to a POLICEMAN standing nearby.
C: CHANCE
D: Excuse me... ... That tree is very sick. It should be cared for.
E: points to tree
N: The Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a man dressed that well must be important.
C: POLICEMAN

C: CHANCE
D: Yes. That would be a good thing to do. Good day.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Good day.
N: The Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance walks away.
S: EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING
N: A fashionable area. Expensive shops, well-kept streets and sidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color TVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves live on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image. He poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it is really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the screen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness disappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two parked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it at the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he does this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made limousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against the car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the limo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY, immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.
C: DAVID
D: I'm very sorry, sir... I...
N: David and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged solidly between the two cars.
C: CHANCE
D: ... I can't move... My leg...
E: in pain
C: DAVID
D: ... My Lord...
E: rushes back to limo
C: JEFFREY
D: This is terrible, sir - I hope you're not badly injured...
C: CHANCE
D: No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
N: David pulls the car forward, freeing Chance. A few bystanders begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the sidewalk.
C: JEFFREY
D: Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
C: CHANCE
D: It's very sore.
E: leans against limo, holds leg
N: David gets out of the car, comes back.
C: DAVID
D: Perhaps I should call an ambulance.
N: A BYSTANDER interrupts.
C: BYSTANDER
D: Somebody ought to call the police!
C: CHANCE
D: There's no need for police, it's just my leg.
E: looks over, smiles
N: During this, the rear door of the limo opens and EVE RAND steps out. Eve is in her late thirties, has the look of a traditional New England lady. She watches as Jeffrey tends to Chance.
C: JEFFREY
D: I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
C: CHANCE
D: I agree.
E: obviously hurting
C: JEFFREY
D: Let's have a look, do you mind?
C: CHANCE
D: Of course. I would like to look.
N: Chance bends, raises his trouser leg. A red-bluish swollen bruise, three inches in diameter, is forming on his calf.
C: JEFFREY
D: It's starting to swell, is it painful?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
N: Eve moves closer to Chance, looks at the bruise.
C: EVE
D: ... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
E: to Chance
C: CHANCE
D: There's no need for a hospital.
E: smiles at Eve
C: EVE
D: Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
N: Eve turns to get back into the limo. David goes with her to hold the door.
C: DAVID
D: I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I never saw the man.
C: EVE
D: Oh, I don't think it was anyone's fault, David.
C: DAVID
D: Thank you, ma'am.
N: Chance is hesitant about getting in the car. Jeffrey offers a helping hand.
C: JEFFREY
D: Please, sir.
C: CHANCE
D: I've never ridden in an automobile.
C: JEFFREY
D: I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
E: a beat
C: CHANCE
D: ... Yes. You can take me.
E: looks at the car, then decides
C: JEFFREY
D: Very good.
N: Jeffrey assists Chance into the rear seat of the limo.
C: CHANCE
D: ... My suitcase.
E: as he gets in
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
N: Jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's suitcase, does not notice the remote control. As Jeffrey puts Chance's bag into the trunk, we see the personalized license plate "RAND l."
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - EVENING
N: Chance and Eve settle in the back seat. As they talk, David starts up the limo, Jeffrey joins him in front and the limo pulls out into traffic.
C: EVE
D: I hope you're comfortable.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I am.
C: EVE
D: These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. He's a very careful driver.
C: EVE
D: ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
C: CHANCE
D: It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
C: EVE
D: I see. ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
E: a thought
C: CHANCE
D: Your family doctor?
E: doesn't understand
C: EVE
D: Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
C: CHANCE
D: I agree.
C: EVE
D: Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
E: leans forward
C: JEFFREY
D: Yes ma'am.
N: Eve presses a button, the glass partition closes. As the window rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone. There is a moment of silence. Eve, still a bit on edge from the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger in the car, presses another button. The limo's bar moves out, revealing a row of decanters and glasses.
C: EVE
D: Would you care for a drink?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Thank you.
N: As Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, Chance notices the limo's TV set.
C: CHANCE
D: I would like to watch television.
E: CONT'D
C: EVE
D: Oh? Certainly...
E: a bit surprised
N: She hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV.
C: EVE
D: Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Hello, Eve.
N: Chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to alcohol, coughs. There is another moment of silence.
C: EVE
D: May I ask your name?
C: CHANCE
D: My name is Chance.
E: with a slight cough
C: EVE
D: Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
C: CHANCE
D: No. I'm a gardener.
E: still indistinct
C: EVE
D: Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
C: CHANCE
D: No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
C: EVE
D: Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
N: Chance reaches out to change the channel on the TV, suddenly realizes he doesn't have his remote control. He starts going through his pockets, searches for it.
C: EVE
D: Did you lose something?
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I lost my remote control.
C: EVE
D: Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
N: Another pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV.
C: EVE
D: ... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer... ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
E: CONT'D Chance still watches TV
C: CHANCE
D: I like to watch. This is fine.
N: Chance watches the news. Eve sips on her cognac as David eases the limo out of the city of Washington.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT
N: The limo approaches, then turns into the entrance-way of the Rand Estate. Two guards stand on either side of the open gate, salute as the car passes through.
S: EXT. RAND DRIVE - NIGHT
N: The drive runs alongside a stream, then turns and crosses a large meadow. The limousine passes, still no sign of the house. It is a very, very long driveway.
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
N: Chance is glued to the TV, switches channels, again watches the news. Eve takes his fascination with television as a sign of intelligence.
C: EVE
D: I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
C: EVE
D: I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
N: Chance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse cartoon. Eve looks at him perplexed, then takes it for a joke and smiles.
S: EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT
N: Two uniformed valets, WILSON and PERKINS, await the limousines by the front door of the Rand mansion. Wilson stands behind a wheelchair. As the limo parks, Perkins and Jeffrey assist Chance into the chair. Wilson turns to Eve as she gets out of the limo.
C: WILSON
D: Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
C: EVE
D: Good evening, Wilson.
C: WILSON
D: I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
C: EVE
D: Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
N: Perkins and Jeffrey carry Chance in the chair up the steps and into the house. Eve and Wilson follow.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Once inside the house, Wilson takes over wheeling Chance. A lady, GRETA, is waiting to take Eve's coat.
C: EVE
D: Thank you, Greta. I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
E: to Wilson
C: WILSON
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: EVE
D: I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
E: to Chance
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I think he should examine my leg.
E: looking around mansion
N: Eve watches as Wilson wheels Chance around a corner.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: The doors open, Wilson pushes Chance into the elevator. As Wilson pushes a button and the doors close on them, a strange look comes over Chance's face.
C: CHANCE
D: ... I've never been in one of these.
E: looks to Wilson
N: Wilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair.
C: WILSON
D: It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's been ill...
N: Chance looks around the elevator.
C: CHANCE
D: Does it have a television?
C: WILSON
D: No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
E: laughs
C: CHANCE
D: I see.
N: Chance again checks out the elevator.
C: CHANCE
D: How long do we stay in here?
E: CONT'D
C: WILSON
D: How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
N: The elevator stops on the third floor.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: A hallway adjoining a large, glass-enclosed room. Eve passes through the hall, enters the room.
S: INT. BENJAMIN RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Eve enters into a hermetically sealed area, set up with all the latest hospital emergency gear; oxygen, EKG machine, X ray machine, transfusion equipment, sterilizers, etc. BENJAMIN RAND, wearing a silk bathrobe, lies in a king-sized bed in the center of the room. A nurse, CONSTANCE, is attending to her duties in the room, looks up as Eve comes in.
C: CONSTANCE
D: Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
N: EVE Good evening, Constance. Ben Rand perks up as he sees Eve crossing to him. He is in his sixties, maintains an inner strength and dignity despite the sapping effects of his illness.
C: RAND
D: ... Eve...
E: with weakness
N: Eve kisses him, holds his hand.
C: EVE
D: Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
C: RAND
D: Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
C: EVE
D: No headaches?
C: RAND
D: No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
C: EVE
D: You heard?
E: holds his hand against her cheek
C: RAND
D: I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
C: EVE
D: Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
C: RAND
D: Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
C: EVE
D: Do you feel well enough for that?
E: sits on the side of the bed
C: RAND
D: Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
E: smiles
N: There is silence from Eve. Rand squeezes her hand, turns to Constance.
C: RAND
D: Constance! I want new blood tonight, I'm getting up for dinner.
E: CONT'D
C: CONSTANCE
D: But, Mr. Rand...
C: RAND
D: Don't argue, tell Robert I want new blood! ... Ask him to dinner.
E: turns to Eve
N: Rand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it.
S: INT. EAST WING GUEST SUITE - NIGHT
N: An enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique furniture. DR. ROBERT ALLENBY dabs Chance's ass with a piece of cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. Chance stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television which is not turned on.
C: ALLENBY
D: The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
C: CHANCE
D: I understand. I've seen it done before.
C: ALLENBY
D: Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
N: Allenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from the pain.
C: CHANCE
D: You were wrong, it did hurt.
C: ALLENBY
D: But not for long...
E: a chuckle
N: As Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a remote control for the TV on the bedside table. He reaches out, picks it up.
C: ALLENBY
D: It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I think so, too.
C: ALLENBY
D: However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
C: CHANCE
D: I see.
N: Chance turns on the TV.
C: ALLENBY
D: You can pull your trousers up, now.
E: a look to the TV, then to Chance
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, fine.
C: ALLENBY
D: Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg. ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
E: as Chance pulls up pants no reaction from Chance, Allenby takes a long look at him
C: CHANCE
D: ... Straight out?
E: doesn't understand
C: ALLENBY
D: Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
C: CHANCE
D: Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
E: after a beat
C: ALLENBY
D: Thomas? Who's Thomas?
C: CHANCE
D: Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
C: ALLENBY
D: An attorney?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
E: turns back to TV
C: ALLENBY
D: Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
E: suddenly very cold
C: CHANCE
D: There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
C: ALLENBY
D: Oh, I see... ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
E: gives Chance a look warms up
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you.
E: changes channels, sits on bed
C: ALLENBY
D: Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
C: ALLENBY
D: Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
C: CHANCE
D: No.
N: Allenby waits for Chance to say more, he does not. Finally, Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.
C: ALLENBY
D: I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
E: stops by door
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I will.
E: clicking changer
N: Allenby gives him a look, then leaves. Chance watches an old movie of a man lighting a cigar. The man enjoys the cigar, blows out smoke. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind.
S: EXT. MANSION - PATIO - NIGHT
N: Eve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming cup of tea. Allenby comes outside, joins her.
C: ALLENBY
D: Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
C: EVE
D: I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
C: ALLENBY
D: A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
C: EVE
D: Stay here? Is that necessary?
C: ALLENBY
D: Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
C: EVE
D: Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
C: ALLENBY
D: How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
C: EVE
D: He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
C: ALLENBY
D: At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
C: EVE
D: Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
E: Eve puts down her tea
C: ALLENBY
D: No, Eve... I'm sorry.
N: Eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.
C: EVE
D: ... Sometimes when I see Ben I could swear that he's getting stronger... Something that he might say, the way he moves, or a look in his eyes - makes me feel that this is all a nightmare and that he'll be better soon... It's just so hard to believe what's really happening...
N: Allenby reaches out, holds Eve's hand.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The elevator door opens, Wilson guides Chance in the wheelchair into the hallway.
C: CHANCE
D: ... That is a very small room.
E: looks back to elevator
C: WILSON
D: Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
E: laughs
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It seems to be.
E: glancing around
N: Wilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels Chance toward Rand's hospital room.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: CONSTANCE and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is being given a transfusion. Rand lifts his head as Wilson wheels Chance into the room.
C: RAND
D: Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
C: CHANCE
D: ... I see.
E: looks around room
N: Wilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where the technician, BILLINGS, a Black man, waits. As Wilson and Billings help Chance onto the X-Ray table, Chance's face brightens up.
C: CHANCE
D: I feel very good in here.
E: CONT'D
C: RAND
D: Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I like that very much.
C: BILLINGS
D: This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner. Please hold still when I ask.
E: lining up Chance's leg
N: Chance stares at Billings, reacts to him being Black.
C: CHANCE
D: Do you know Raphael?
E: to Billings
C: BILLINGS
D: No sir, I don't believe I do.
C: CHANCE
D: Oh. I have a message for him.
C: BILLINGS
D: Yes, sir.
C: CHANCE
D: A Black man gave me the message.
C: BILLINGS
D: Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
N: Rand looks over as Billings takes the X-Ray.
C: RAND
D: Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner - aplastic anemia.
N: Chance smiles to Rand.
C: RAND
D: Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. You look very sick.
E: still smiles at Rand
C: BILLINGS
D: Hold still, please, Mr. Gardiner.
C: RAND
D: I am very sick, and, as you can see by all this paraphernalia, I am very wealthy. I think I would rather be wealthy and sick than poor and sick.
E: a laugh
C: CHANCE
D: I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
E: looks around the room
C: BILLINGS
D: Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
C: CONSTANCE
D: You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay quiet.
N: Rand lays his head back.
C: RAND
D: ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
C: CHANCE
D: I agree.
C: RAND
D: ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
E: flat on his back
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I am very hungry.
E: also flat on his back
C: RAND
D: ... So am I, my boy - so am I.
S: INT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: THURMAND, a waiter, and MARIANNE, a waitress, enter into the Rand dining room carrying trays of food. The dining room is immense, a 70-foot ceiling, huge fireplace. Allenby, Eve, Rand, and Chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table. Rand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness.
C: RAND
D: I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
C: ALLENBY
D: To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
C: RAND
D: Of course! By kid-lawyers!
N: Eve turns to Chance.
C: EVE
D: Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
C: CHANCE
D: No. It won't do that.
C: EVE
D: ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
C: CHANCE
D: No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
N: There is a moment of silence.
C: EVE
D: Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
C: RAND
D: Do you need a secretary?
C: CHANCE
D: No, thank you. My house has been closed.
C: RAND
D: Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
C: RAND
D: What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
C: EVE
D: I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
C: CHANCE
D: No. I like it here.
C: RAND
D: That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Chauncey is fine.
E: agreeable to being called Chauncey
C: RAND
D: And I'm Ben.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... And please call me Robert.
E: smiles to Chance
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Robert. I will.
C: RAND
D: So tell me, Chauncey, what are your plans now?
N: Chance looks around the room.
C: CHANCE
D: Does this house have a garden?
N: Allenby gives Chance a look.
C: RAND
D: Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
C: CHANCE
D: I see. I would like to work in your garden.
C: EVE
D: Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
E: laughs
C: CHANCE
D: I am a very good gardener.
C: RAND
D: A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
C: RAND
D: Bravo!
E: weakly
C: CHANCE
D: But I don't have that any more... ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
E: points to ceiling
C: RAND
D: Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
N: There is a long pause. Chance looks up, then smiles at Rand.
C: CHANCE
D: It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
C: RAND
D: Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
E: laughs
N: Another period of silence. The servants bustle around the room as Allenby studies Chance.
S: INT. RAND'S POOL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Allenby opens the door. Rand enters in his electric wheelchair followed by Chance being pushed by Wilson.
C: RAND
D: ... I don't know what you've heard about me, Chauncey, but I'm sure you know everything there is to know. Cigar?
N: Rand holds out humidor to Chance.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, thank you. No Ben. I don't know everything about you.
E: takes cigar
N: Rand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself.
C: RAND
D: ... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
C: ALLENBY
D: That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you, Robert.
N: Rand lights his own cigar, then hands an ornate lighter to Chance.
C: RAND
D: ... You know, Chauncey, there are thousands of American businessmen, large and small, that share your plight. I've been concerned with the situation for some time now.
E: picks up pool cue, weakly strokes the balls
N: Chance, not knowing to bite off the tip, tries to light the cigar like the man on TV. It will not light.
C: RAND
D: So I've been thinking about beginning a financial assistance program, Chauncey, to help out American businessmen that have been harassed by inflation, excessive taxation, unions and other indecencies...
E: CONT'D
N: Allenby watches Chance trying to light the cigar as Rand speaks on, shooting pool as he talks.
C: RAND
D: ... I'd like to offer the decent 'Gardeners' of the business community a helping hand. After all, they are our strongest defense against the pollutants who so threaten our basic freedoms and the well-being of our middle class. Tell me, would you have any thoughts on such a program?
N: Chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at Allenby, then answers Rand.
C: CHANCE
D: No, Ben.
C: RAND
D: Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
E: a smile
C: CHANCE
D: I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
C: RAND
D: ... Oh? Robert, take a look, would you?
E: looks to Allenby
C: ALLENBY
D: Some pain is to be expected... ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest. ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
E: bends to Chance, looks at leg checks watch
C: RAND
D: We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!

D: I agree.
N: Allenby laughs as he takes Rand's cigar from him, snuffs it in the ashtray.
S: INT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: Wilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair. Chance glances slowly and inquisitively around the elevator. When his eyes meet Wilson's, the valet breaks out in laughter.
C: WILSON
D: ... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't contain myself... I knew you were going to come out with another one of your jests about the elevator... Excuse me, sir...
E: laughing, trying to apologize
N: The elevator stops, the door opens.
S: INT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Wilson wheels Chance out of the elevator.
C: CHANCE
D: ... Hmmm... Elevator.
E: looks back as the door closes
C: WILSON
D: ... Yes sir - elevator!
E: laughs again
N: Wilson stops laughing, becomes the stone-faced servant once again as he notices Eve coming out of her bedroom. Wilson stops wheeling Chance, stands stiffly at attention as Eve and Chance talk.
C: EVE
D: Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
C: EVE
D: ... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
C: CHANCE
D: Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
C: EVE
D: Yes... I know, Chauncey.
C: CHANCE
D: I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
C: EVE
D: He does...?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
N: Eve is not prepared for such a question.
C: EVE
D: ... Why... No, I don't think so...
C: CHANCE
D: That's good.
N: Chance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence before Eve steps back into her bedroom.
C: EVE
D: ... Good night, Chauncey.
C: CHANCE
D: Good night, Eve.
N: Eve closes the door. Wilson wheels Chance down the hallway toward the guest room.
S: EXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING
N: Eve comes out of the house, Jeffrey holds the door for her as she gets into "RAND l." Jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls away. Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a limp. His first view of the Rand grounds in the daylight, he is taken by the extent of the greenery. An attendant, LEWIS, hurries to Chance.
C: LEWIS
D: Did you want a car, sir?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I would like a car.
C: LEWIS
D: Yes, sir.
N: Lewis goes to his post, picks up a phone. As Chance looks at the surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's wheelchair, come out of the house.
C: ALLENBY
D: Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
E: frowns as he sees Chance walking
C: CHANCE
D: It's fine today, Robert.
C: ALLENBY
D: Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that. Please, sit in the chair.
E: motions to Wilson
N: Wilson pushes the wheelchair to Chance, he sits.
C: ALLENBY
D: I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full... ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably... ... Any pain here?
E: CONT'D checks leg looks at calf pokes a spot
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
N: A limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits for Chance.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
E: continues examining
C: CHANCE
D: Hardly any, Robert.
N: Lewis, the attendant, interrupts.
C: LEWIS
D: Your limousine, sir.
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, thank you.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... Were you going somewhere?
E: reacting to limo
C: CHANCE
D: No, Robert.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... Oh. ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
E: a beat checks leg
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... Oh? You've heard?
E: mildly surprised
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
C: ALLENBY
D: He does, does he?
E: stands
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
C: ALLENBY
D: Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
C: CHANCE
D: How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
N: A long look from Allenby, then he looks at his watch.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you, Robert.
N: Wilson begins to push Chance.
C: CHANCE
D: I would like to walk today.
E: CONT'D
C: ALLENBY
D: Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, really?
E: gets out of chair
N: Allenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Chance goes into the house.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Chance limps aimlessly through a hallway. He stops, admires a large tapestry on the wall. A servant, SMYTHE, notices Chance appears confused, approaches him.
C: SMYTHE
D: May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
E: with a smile
C: SMYTHE
D: ... Sir?
E: a pause
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
N: There is another long pause.
C: SMYTHE
D: ... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I would like to see Ben.
C: SMYTHE
D: Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
N: Chance follows Smythe down the hall.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
N: Rand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the President. The two nurses are working at the disinfecting table. Rand smiles as Chance is shown into the room by Smythe.
C: RAND
D: Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
C: RAND
D: Well, that's good news, my boy.
C: CHANCE
D: You're looking much better today, Ben.
C: RAND
D: Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
C: CHANCE
D: I understand.
C: RAND
D: No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you, Ben. ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
E: looks at Rand closely
N: The nurses turn, look at Chance.
S: EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING
N: Wilson is at the head of eight servants lined up on the front steps. Two black PLYMOUTH SEDANS pull up and park. EIGHT MEN in grey business suits get out. One of them, WOLTZ, goes directly to Wilson.

C: WILSON
D: Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice to see you again.

N: Allenby gets off the elevator, stands and thinks for a moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction of Chance's room.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
N: Chance watches television as Rand speaks.
C: RAND
D: Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
C: CHANCE
D: I see, Ben.
E: changing channels
C: RAND
D: ... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
S: EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING
N: Two black limousines followed by a station wagon with small holes in the side pull up in front of the mansion. As men from the first limousine and the station wagon jump out and take positions around the driveway, Lewis hurries to his post, picks up his phone.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - MORNING
N: The nerve center of the Rand Enterprises since he has become ill. Four or five desks, all the latest electronic office equipment, three TV's with video taping facilities, countless telephones. MRS. AUBREY, Rand's senior secretary, is at her desk, answers her phone.

N: Rand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle in his eyes.
C: RAND
D: It's an old habit that goes along with power -- keep them waiting...
E: CONT'D
N: Teresa brings Rand's wheelchair to him.
C: RAND
D: Not now, Teresa. I'm seeing the President on my own two feet.
E: CONT'D stands, very weak
C: TERESA
D: But, Mr. Rand...
C: RAND
D: Shall we go, Chauncey?

E: barely able to stand
C: PRESIDENT
D: Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you. Here, sit down, get off your feet.

C: CHANCE
D: Good morning, Mr. President.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... Hello.
E: smiling
N: Chance and the President exchange a two-handed handshake. Rand, still weak from standing, catches his breath and introduces Chance.
C: RAND
D: Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
C: CHANCE
D: You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... Oh, really...
E: a beat
C: RAND
D: You will find that my house guest does not bandy words, Mr. President.
E: smiling
N: The President gives Chance a look, then laughs.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I will.
E: sitting
C: PRESIDENT
D: Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
E: also sits
N: Chance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes?
N: There is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically, then he continues.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
C: RAND
D: Yes, I did.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... Well?
C: RAND
D: Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Well, Ben... I...
C: RAND
D: I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
C: PRESIDENT
D: That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes?
E: again perks up
N: Once again, the President gives Chance a puzzled look.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Perkins accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF as he checks out the third floor. Riff knocks on each door, looks inside, then moves in.
S: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING
N: Allenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for some sort of identification. There is a knock at the door, Allenby pulls back from the closet as Riff opens the door, looks inside.
C: ALLENBY
D: Oh... Hello.
C: RIFF
D: Good morning. I'm Riff, Secret Service.
E: entering
C: ALLENBY
D: ... Yes. Of course.
N: Perkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector over Allenby's clothing.
S: INT. LIBRARY - MORNING
N: The President is worried about what Rand is telling him. He paces, smokes a cigarette. Chance smiles through it all.
C: RAND
D: ... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
C: PRESIDENT
D: It's that serious, huh?
C: RAND
D: I'm afraid so.
N: The President now looks nearly as bad as Rand. He sits, turns to Chance.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
C: CHANCE
D: As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
E: a beat
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... In the garden?
E: a pause
C: CHANCE
D: That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... Spring and summer... Yes, I see... Fall and winter. Yes, indeed... Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
E: staring at Chance confused smiles at Chance a beat
C: RAND
D: I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. That is correct.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must admit, that is one of the most refreshing and optimistic statements I've heard in a very, very long time.
E: pleased
N: The President puts out his cigarette, rises.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... Many of us forget that nature and society are one! Yes, though we have tried to cut ourselves off from nature, we are still a part of it! Like nature, our economic system remains, in the long run, stable and rational. And that is why we must not fear to be at its mercy! ... I envy your good, solid sense, Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely what we lack on Capitol Hill. I must be going. Mr. Gardiner, this visit has been enlightening...
E: CONT'D he smiles at Chance, who is absorbed in looking around the room at the books glances at watch holds out hand to Chance
N: Chance rises and shakes the President's hand.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It has.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I will.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you. Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
E: turns to Rand
C: RAND
D: No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
C: RAND
D: Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
N: The President clasps Rand's hand.
C: RAND
D: You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Take care of yourself, Ben.
C: RAND
D: You take care too, Bobby.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Mr. Gardiner...
E: as he turns to go, a smile to Chance
N: The President leaves the library and Chance sits back down.
C: RAND
D: He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
E: as the door closes
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Ben - he is.
C: RAND
D: He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
C: CHANCE
D: I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
S: EXT. RAND MANSION - MORNING
N: An aide, KAUFMAN, waits by the front door of the Rand mansion. As the President comes out, he speaks quietly to Kaufman.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
C: KAUFMAN
D: Gardiner, yes, sir.
E: makes note of name
C: PRESIDENT
D: And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
C: KAUFMAN
D: No problem, Chief.
N: They head toward the waiting limousines.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Rand has an arm around Chance, hangs on for dear life as the two of them walk through the hall. Behind them, Wilson and Perkins push empty wheelchairs.
C: RAND
D: ... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
E: very weak
C: CHANCE
D: No, Ben.
E: blankly
C: RAND
D: Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
C: CHANCE
D: I understand.
C: RAND
D: And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
E: stops outside his door
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you, Ben.
C: RAND
D: And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
N: Wilson and Perkins leave the wheelchairs, assist Rand into his hospital room.
C: CHANCE
D: I'm sorry that you are so sick, Ben.
E: as they go in
N: The door closes, Chance limps off down the hall.
S: EXT. RAND MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
N: Chance, with a limp, walks down a pathway in the garden, admires the greenery. In the background, coming from the house, we see Eve.
C: EVE
D: Chauncey!
E: approaches Chance, calls
C: CHANCE
D: Hello, Eve.
E: stops, turns
C: EVE
D: Your leg must be getting better.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It's feeling much better now.
C: EVE
D: Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?
E: they walk together
C: CHANCE
D: Fine. He's very nice.
C: EVE
D: Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
N: They walk along in silence for a moment. Chance sees a huge greenhouse not far from them, heads toward it. Eve turns to him, hesitates, then questions.
C: EVE
D: ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
C: EVE
D: Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
C: CHANCE
D: He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
E: looking at greenhouse
C: EVE
D: Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
C: CHANCE
D: ... Mentor...?
E: quizzically
N: Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old Man.
C: EVE
D: Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I was.
C: EVE
D: I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
E: getting more to the point
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
C: EVE
D: Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
E: relieved
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
C: EVE
D: Of course.
E: pleased
N: Eve edges slightly closer to Chance. Chance edges slightly closer to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it.
C: CHANCE
D: What is that?
C: EVE
D: Our greenhouse.
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, I like that very much.
E: pleased
C: EVE
D: Yes, so do we.
N: Chance peeks through one of the windows.
S: INT. RAND'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Rand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around him, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the President's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is looking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned glance his way.
C: PRESIDENT'S VOICE
D: ... And there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history. And there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course. Well, let me tell you, gentlemen, I have been conducting multiple-level consultations with members of the Cabinet, House and Senate. I have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country. And this very morning I had an in-depth discussion with your founder and Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand and his close friend and advisor Mr. Chauncey Gardiner...
N: Rand perks up a bit at this mention. Allenby manages a smile, once again looks at Rand, checking his condition. Eve looks proudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen.
C: PRESIDENT'S VOICE
D: ... Well, gentlemen, I found this to be a most rewarding conference... To quote Mr. Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil, the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny.'
E: CONT'D
N: Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily. Allenby and the nurses rush to his bedside. Allenby shoots a quick look to Eve and Chance.
C: ALLENBY
D: Excuse us, please.
E: motioning toward door
N: Eve and Chance leave the room as Allenby administers aid to Rand.
C: PRESIDENT'S VOICE
D: Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter, instead, let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime, let us await the rewards of summer. As in a garden of the earth, let us learn to accept and appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when we pick the fruit.
S: EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - DAY
N: Eve and Chance sit in silence on the patio. Eve's eyes are swollen, red, she has been crying. She turns to Chance, reaches out, touches his hand.

E: hesitates pause pause
C: CHANCE
D: So am I, Eve.
N: Allenby comes out the door, his mood is serious, professional. Eve turns quickly, awaits his news.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
E: sits alongside Eve
C: EVE
D: ... But he's...?
E: anxious
C: ALLENBY
D: He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
N: Mrs. Aubrey comes out of the house.
C: MRS. AUBREY
D: Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you.
E: not moving
C: MRS. AUBREY
D: Would you care to take it, sir?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
N: Chance still does not move. Eve mistakes Chance's not moving for concern for herself. She puts a hand on his shoulder.
C: EVE
D: I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
E: rising
N: Chance follows Mrs. Aubrey into the house. Eve watches him go, then turns to Allenby.
C: EVE
D: ... He's such a sensitive man, so considerate...

C: CHANCE
D: No. I'm not busy.
E: looking from one TV to the other
C: COURTNEY
D: Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
C: CHANCE
D: The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
C: COURTNEY
D: Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
C: CHANCE
D: I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
C: COURTNEY
D: Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
N: Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning.
C: COURTNEY
D: I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
C: CHANCE
D: I have nothing more to say.
N: Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs. Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver down.

C: CHANCE
D: Oh, yes.
C: MRS. AUBREY
D: Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I have seen that show on television.
C: MRS. AUBREY
D: Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I would like to be on that show.
C: MRS. AUBREY
D: Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice. ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?

C: KAUFMAN
D: Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
C: PRESIDENT
D: He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
E: interrupts
C: KAUFMAN
D: Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
C: PRESIDENT
D: I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt. I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time. I've got to take a leak.

C: EVE
D: I know you do - you and your television... ... Good luck, Chauncey.
E: a pause
N: Eve impulsively steps forward, kisses Chance on the cheek. Chance smiles at her, and Eve, slightly embarrassed, turns and leaves the room. Chance sits back down, watches TV as Perkins attends to his clothes with a whisk broom.
S: INT. WASHINGTON POST - STAFF ROOM - NIGHT
N: Courtney heads a meeting of his four staffers. One man, KINNEY, a research assistant, sits behind a stack of paperwork, has a downcast expression as he listens to Courtney.
C: COURTNEY
D: ... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background... ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
E: turns to Kinney
C: KINNEY
D: ... Nothing.
E: after a pause
C: COURTNEY
D: ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
E: sighs, taps pencil on table
C: KINNEY

S: INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: Chance is intrigued by the surroundings as Hull guides him through the corridor.
C: HULL
D: Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
C: CHANCE
D: I see.
C: HULL
D: Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?

D: Yes. It's a very good show.
C: HULL
D: I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
N: Hull takes Chance into the MAKE-UP room.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Constance is in the closet, searching through Chance's pockets, finding nothing. She takes out a small knife, cuts a label from one of the jackets. Quickly, she examines one of Chance's shoes, copies the name of the shoemaker in a notebook. Constance hurries to the dresser, continues her search.
S: INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM NIGHT
N: COLSON, the makeup man, comes through the corridor carrying a glass of water. He turns into the makeup room, goes to Chance who sits in front of the lights. Hull sits next to Chance, briefs him on the show. Chance has his eyes on a TV monitor, watches the guest preceding him on "This Evening."
C: COLSON
D: Here you go, Mr. Gardiner.

C: CHANCE
D: Thank you. I'm very thirsty.
C: COLSON
D: Yes, sir - it's hot under those lights.
N: Colson applies finishing touches to Chance.

E: Chance watches TV
N: On the TV, WILLIAM DUPONT, the host, wraps up his talk with his guest.
C: COLSON
D: Okay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set.
E: a last-minute dab

S: INT. TV STATION - "THIS EVENING" STUDIO - NIGHT
N: William Dupont introduces Chance.
C: DUPONT
D: Ladies and gentlemen, our very distinguished quest, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner!
N: The BAND plays as Chance comes onto the stage. An audience of about three hundred applauds Chance as he appears. Two TV cameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp, to center stage. Dupont shakes Chance's hand, Chance holds Dupont's hand with both of his own.
C: DUPONT
D: Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
C: DUPONT
D: I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
E: showing Chance to chair
C: CHANCE
D: You're welcome.
E: sits
C: DUPONT
D: I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
E: also sitting
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. That is surprising.
C: DUPONT
D: ... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
E: a beat
C: CHANCE
D: I hope so.
E: doesn't understand
C: DUPONT
D: Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
C: CHANCE
D: No. I don't object.
C: DUPONT
D: Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
C: CHANCE
D: Which view?
N: Applause and laughter from the audience. Dupont accustomed to parrying with his guests, asks again.
C: DUPONT
D: Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I was there with Ben.
C: DUPONT
D: I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
C: DUPONT
D: Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
E: a beat
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
N: The audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor. Dupont waits for it all to subside, then asks another question.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Rand is in bed. Eve sits in a chair next to the bed, squeezes Rand's hand in excitement as they both watch Chance on television. Teresa, the nurse, watches in the background.
C: DUPONT
D: ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was very well put indeed, and I feel it was a booster for all of us who do not like to wallow in complaints or take delight in gloomy predictions.
E: over TV
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The President and First Lady are in bed together watching the show.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Gloomy predictions? That insolent son of a bitch!
C: DUPONT
D: Let's make it clear, Mr. Gardiner, it's your view that the collapse of the Stock Market, the dramatic increase in unemployment, you feel that this is just another season, so to speak, in the garden?
E: over TV
N: The First Lady cuddles close the President, ruffles his hair, tries to cheer him up.
S: INT. TV STUDIO - "THIS EVENING SHOW" - NIGHT
N: Chance answers.
C: CHANCE
D: In a garden, things grow - but first some things must wither; some trees lose their leaves before they grow new leaves...
S: INT. CIA ROOM - NIGHT
N: A small, dark room. A videotape machine is running. Also, a machine is turning that records the harmonics of Chance's voice. TWO CIA MEN run the equipment, watch as a needle charts Chance's voice onto paper.
C: CHANCE
D: ... Then they grow thicker and stronger and taller. Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them. Gardens need a lot of care and a lot of love.
E: over TV
S: INT. THOMAS FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Franklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth. His wife, JOHANNA, is in bed absorbed in "This Evening." Franklin sits on the end of the bed, watches the show.
C: CHANCE
D: ... And if you give your garden a lot of love, and if you work very hard and have a lot of patience, in the proper season you will see it grow to be very beautiful...
E: over TV
N: More applause from the TV. Franklin leans closer to the set.
C: FRANKLIN
D: It's that gardener!
E: puzzled
C: JOHANNA
D: Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
C: FRANKLIN
D: No! He's a real gardener!
C: JOHANNA
D: He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
E: laughs
C: DUPONT
D: I think your metaphors are quite interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but, haven't we seen seasons that have been devastating to certain countries?
E: over TV
S: INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The President and First Lady continue to watch.
C: DUPONT
D: Such as disasterous winters, prolonged droughts that have wiped out crops, hurricanes that have all but swept away island communities? Doesn't a country need to have someone in charge that can see it through such crises?
E: over TV
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... That bastard...
N: The First Lady moves closer to him.
S: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: The TV, its volume low, plays in the background as Constance, with a pair of tweezers, plucks a hair from Chance's pillow, puts it into a small vial.
C: DUPONT
D: Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
E: over TV
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. We need a very good gardener.
E: over TV
S: INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
N: Dupont continues his questions.
C: DUPONT
D: Do you feel that we have a 'Very good gardener' in office at this time, Mr. Gardiner?
N: At the end of the question, Dupont glances over Chance's shoulder to look at the monitor.
C: CHANCE
D: I understand.
E: a beat
N: Chance turns to see what Dupont is looking at, sees the back of his own head on the TV screen.
C: DUPONT
D: I realize that might be a difficult question for you, Mr. Gardiner - but there are a lot of us around the country that would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.
N: Chance is still turned to the monitor.
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, yes. It is possible for one side of the garden to be flooded, and the other side to be dry...
S: INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Allenby watches Chance on television. The camera that covered Dupont in close-up has now pulled back, includes Dupont and Chance, both looking into camera. Allenby is concerned, he is unsure of Chance.
C: CHANCE
D: ... Some plants do well in the sun, and others grow better in the cool of the shade.
E: over TV
S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
N: A group of ELDERLY BLACK PEOPLE sit in the lobby, watch "This Evening" on an old black-and-white TV.
C: CHANCE
D: ... It is the gardener's responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry. It is the gardener's responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the shade of a high wall...
E: over TV
N: During the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old Man's house, chatters.
C: LOUISE
D: Gobbledegook! All the time he talked gobbledegook! An' it's for sure a White man's world in America, hell, I raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant an' I'll say right now he never learned to read an' write - no sir! Had no brains at all, was stuffed with rice puddin' between the ears! Shortchanged by the Lord and dumb as a jackass an' look at him now! Yes, sir - all you gotta be is white in America an' you get whatever you want! Just listen to that boy - gobbledegook!
N: There is a chorus of "Amens" as she finishes.
S: INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
N: Chance continues.
C: CHANCE
D: ... It is the responsibility of the gardener to adjust to the bad seasons as well as enjoy the good ones. If the gardener does his job, everything will be fine.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Audience applause is heard over TV. Rand claps weakly along with the TV sound. Eve and Teresa also clap.
C: RAND
D: Splendid. Just splendid...
E: smiling
N: Rand looks up as Constance comes into the room.
C: RAND
D: Damn, Constance, get in here! You shouldn't miss any of this!
E: CONT'D
N: Constance hurries to Teresa's side. Rand turns to Eve.
C: RAND
D: I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached... ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
E: CONT'D Eve smiles
C: EVE
D: ... Yes, I am, Ben.
E: a beat
C: RAND
D: That's good... That's good.
E: reaches out, takes her hand
C: DUPONT
D: Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
E: over TV
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you.
E: over TV
S: INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
N: Dupont asks another question.
C: DUPONT
D: I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
C: CHANCE
D: I am a very serious gardener.
E: with confidence
S: INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: More applause over the TV. The President pales.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Oh, Jesus...
N: He rolls over in bed. The First Lady reaches out, puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.
S: INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Franklin holds a phone to his ear with one hand, shuts off the TV with the other.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Okay, I'll see you in twenty minutes.
N: Franklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting dressed. His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed.
C: JOHANNA
D: ... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
E: coldly
C: FRANKLIN
D: Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
C: JOHANNA
D: Good night.
E: turns over in bed
C: FRANKLIN
D: Look, Johanna...
C: JOHANNA
D: I said good night!
E: cuts him off
N: Franklin gives up, hurries from the room.
S: INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: Colson, carefully carrying his overcoat, walks with Chance through the corridor. A delighted Hull walks behind them.
C: COLSON
D: Marvelous! Just marvelous, Mr. Gardiner! What spirit you have, what confidence! Exactly what this country needs!
N: Chance smiles at well-wishers as they continue on through the corridor.
S: INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The First Lady is snuggled up close to the President, caresses his body. After a moment, it becomes clear to her that he is not up to the occasion.
C: FIRST LADY
D: ... Darling... What's wrong?
C: PRESIDENT,
D: ... I can't... I just can't right now... I'm sorry, dearest... I just can't...
N: The First Lady looks at him for a beat, then turns, lies on her back and stares at the ceiling.
S: INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: An 'in' meeting place for the upper-middle Washington, D.C. crowd. Thomas Franklin and Sally Hayes sit at a table, drinks in front of them.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... It didn't make any sense to me at all. I didn't know what the hell he was talking about...
C: SALLY
D: He wasn't making a speech to us, Tom - he was talking to the masses. He was very clever, keeping it at a third grade level - that's what they understand...
C: FRANKLIN
D: Yeah? Well, I don't understand what was up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt with us? What was he doing? And why?
C: SALLY
D: Who knows...? Maybe the government had something to do with it.
C: FRANKLIN
D: You know, Sally - I really feel like I've been had, and you know what that means, don't you?... It means that any political future I had is right down the toilet!
N: The CAMERA begins to slowly move away from the table, the sound of Franklin's voice continues.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... Jesus, the thought of spending the rest of my life as an attorney, that is really a downer... And, Christ, Sally, I almost forgot Johanna is starting to think something's going on between...
E: CONT'D
N: Franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub. The voice of Kinney, the research assistant from the Washington Post is heard as the camera settles on a table occupied by Sidney Courtney and his staff.
C: KINNEY
D: ... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
C: COURTNEY
D: Try again.
C: KINNEY
D: Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
C: COURTNEY
D: Try again.
C: KINNEY
D: Sid, it's useless!
C: COURTNEY
D: I said - try again.
N: Kinney stands, shoves his paperwork across the table.
C: KINNEY
D: Up yours, Sid. You try again, I quit!
N: Kinney takes his drink with him as he leaves the lounge.
S: EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT
N: The household staff is lined up on the front steps, applauding Chance as he steps from the limousine. Chance accepts the plaudit, though does not understand the reason. As he nears the steps, Perkins and Wilson step forward.
C: WILSON
D: An outstanding speech, sir.
C: PERKINS
D: May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. Thank you, Perkins.
N: Perkins nods, takes Chance's overcoat, allows everyone to enter the house ahead of him. Alone on the steps, Perkins quickly searches through the pockets of the coat, finds nothing.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Rand is in bed. Eve sits on the edge, looks warmly to Chance who stands nearby. Allenby prepares an injection for Rand, and occasionally glances curiously at Chance. Chance breathes deeply, enjoys the oxygen.
C: RAND
D: ... You possess a great gift, Chauncey, of being natural. And that, my boy, is a rare talent, the true mark of a leader. You were strong and brave, yet did not moralize. I hope the entire country was watching you tonight, the entire country...
E: with some effort
N: Allenby crosses to Rand, needle in hand.
C: ALLENBY
D: And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
C: RAND
D: In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
E: holds up hand
C: CHANCE
D: Certainly, Ben.
C: RAND
D: Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
C: RAND
D: Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
C: EVE
D: ... Ben, really...
E: with a blush
C: RAND
D: ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much. ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
E: reaches out a tired hand to Chance - Chance holds it takes back hand
N: Eve and Chance quietly leave the room. Allenby watches Chance go, then readies Rand for the injection.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The elevator door opens, Eve and Chance come into the hallway. Chance looks back at the elevator for a beat, then the two walk quietly down the hall.
C: EVE
D: ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
E: stopping by bedroom door
C: CHANCE
D: No, thank you.
C: EVE
D: Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
C: CHANCE
D: I see.
C: EVE
D: ... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
E: a pause, softly
N: Eve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the lips. She steps back, smiles.
C: EVE
D: ... Good night, Chauncey.
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Good night, Eve.
N: Eve goes into her bedroom, closes the door. Chance heads for his room as though nothing had happened.
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE ANTE ROOM - MORNING
N: Kaufman and the five other Aides nervously await the President's arrival. The door opens, the President briskly enters the room.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Good morning, gentlemen.
C: AIDES
D: Good morning, sir.
E: as one
N: The President leads the way into the Oval Office.
S: INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
N: As the President goes to his desk, Kaufman hands him a folder. The President sits, reads it quickly, it is very brief.
C: PRESIDENT
D: This is not what I requested.
E: to Kaufman
C: KAUFMAN
D: No, sir.
C: PRESIDENT
D: This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
C: KAUFMAN
D: Right, Chief.
C: PRESIDENT
D: So...? Where the hell is it?
C: KAUFMAN
D: We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
C: PRESIDENT
D: What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
C: KAUFMAN
D: Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
C: KAUFMAN
D: Yes, sir.
N: Kaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right.
C: KAUFMAN
D: Suits hand-made by a tailor in Chicago in 1918. The tailor went out of business in 1929, then took his own life. ... His shoes were hand-made in 1928. The cobbler has long since been dead. Underwear, all of the finest cloth, factory destroyed by fire in 1938. The man carries no identification; no wallet, no driver's license, no credit cards. ... He carries one item along with him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch crafted at the turn of the century; so far they have been unable to ascertain where or when purchase was made. ... He has never dyed his hair. ... Computers have analyzed Gardiner's vocal characteristics; it is impossible to determine his ethnic background, they feel his accent may be northeastern, but they will not commit to that. ... Fingerprint check proved negative, no identification possible. ... That's it, Mr. President.
E: CONT'D reading a pause
N: The President stares at Kaufman for a beat, then speaks into his intercom.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs poached this morning, please.
E: into intercom
N: A quick "Yes sir" from Miss Davis over the intercom. The President leans back in his swivel chair, looks at Kaufman.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... So what does all that add up to?
E: CONT'D
C: KAUFMAN
D: Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I would appreciate that.
E: with sarcasm
N: The Aides quickly leave the office.
S: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING
N: Chance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast. A pile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed, untouched. The TV is playing, Chance watches as he eats. There is a knock at the door.
C: CHANCE
D: Come in!
E: without turning from TV
N: Eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown.
C: EVE
D: Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
C: CHANCE
D: No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
C: EVE
D: Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
E: moving to bed
C: CHANCE
D: I like the President. He is a very nice man.
C: EVE
D: I know... ... So are you, Chauncey ... ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
E: sits on bed a moment another moment, Chance watches TV
C: CHANCE
D: No, Eve. I like you to be here.
E: a bite of toast
N: Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance.
C: EVE
D: ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be... I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
E: with difficulty
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Eve. I know that.
N: Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then losing control, the tears flowing freely. To comfort her, Chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his breakfast tray. Eve responds to his touch, draws closer, holds Chance tightly. Chance does his best to avoid spilling his breakfast, keep an eye on the TV, and to comfort Eve. She gives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her hand over his body. She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his lips, his ears. Chance does not return the lovemaking, and Eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. She lies quietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then speaks.
C: EVE
D: ... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that... ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
E: Chance,confused, turns to her
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
C: EVE
D: I know you are, Chauncey... ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
E: a pause
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. That could be true.
E: another bite of toast
C: EVE
D: ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
E: sits up
N: Eve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence. She rises, straightens her robe and moves toward the door.
C: EVE
D: ... I do love you, Chauncey.
E: CONT'D stopping by door
N: A knock at the door startles Eve. She turns, opens it to MAGGIE, the seam tress. Maggie carries one of Rand's tuxedos.
C: EVE
D: Oh, come in, Maggie.
E: CONT'D
C: MAGGIE
D: Yes, ma'am.
E: entering
C: EVE
D: Chauncey, Maggie will alter Ben's tuxedo for you now.
C: CHANCE
D: Fine.
N: Eve leaves. Maggie stands by patiently as Chance eats his once-warm scrambled eggs and watches"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood" on TV.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S ROOM - DAY
N: Allenby is at his desk, searching through the Washington, D.C. telephone book. He finds a number, dials.
C: ALLENBY
D: Mr. Thomas Franklin, please. Is Thomas Franklin in? Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby, would you please tell Mr. Franklin that I would like to talk to him? It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.
E: into phone a wait a beat
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK
N: Teresa and Constance work in a corner of the room. Rand is in bed, very still, deep in thought.
S: EXT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING
N: The RAND 1 limousine pulls up to Sophie's house. Jeffrey opens the door for Eve and Chance. He wears Ben's tuxedo, Eve is in a formal gown. The press is waiting, a couple of reporters, 5 photographers and a mini-cam crew from local TV station gather around Eve and Chance. REPORTER #1 Mr. Gardiner, what did you think of the Post's editorial on the President's speech?
C: CHANCE
D: I didn't read it.
E: smiling for photogs
N: REPORTER #2 (surprised) But air - you must have at least glanced at it.
C: CHANCE
D: No. I did not glance at it.
N: REPORTER #3 Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of optimism,' what was your reaction to that?
C: CHANCE
D: I did not read that either.
E: continues to pose for pictures
N: REPORTER #3 Well, how do you feel about that phrase, 'Peculiar brand of optimism?'
C: CHANCE
D: I do not know what it means.
N: REPORTER #2 Sorry to persist, air, but it would be of great interest to me to know what newspapers you do read.
C: CHANCE
D: I do not read any newspapers. I watch TV.
N: There is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this. The TV Reporter smiles, questions Chance.
C: TV REPORTER
D: ... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that you find television's coverage of the news superior to that of the newspapers?
C: CHANCE
D: I like to watch TV.
E: flatly
C: TV REPORTER
D: ) Thank you, Mr. Gardiner, for what is probably the most honest admission to come from a public figure in years. Few men in public life have the courage not to read newspapers none have the guts to admit it.
E: pleased
C: CHANCE
D: You're welcome.
N: Eve and Chance walk toward the front door, leaving the newsmen to talk among themselves.
C: EVE
D: I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you, Eve.
N: The front door is opened for them by an attendant.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING
N: The Black Tie reception is in progress. The house is crowded, possibly a hundred guests, mostly foreign ambassadors and other such dignitaries. Eve and Chance enter, are greeted by DENNIS WATSON, a State Department official.
C: WATSON
D: Mrs. Rand, how good to see you.
C: EVE
D: Mr. Watson.
C: WATSON
D: And you must be Mr. Gardiner, correct?
E: looks to Chance
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
C: EVE
D: Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
C: CHANCE
D: Hello, Dennis.
E: they shake
C: WATSON
D: A pleasure to meet you, sir.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It is.
N: SOPHIE, an older woman bedecked with jewelry, approaches, embraces Eve.
C: SOPHIE
D: Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
C: EVE
D: Hello, Sophie.
N: Sophie steps back, looks at Chance.
C: SOPHIE
D: And look who you brought with!
C: EVE
D: Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
C: SOPHIE
D: Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
E: hugs Chance
C: EVE
D: Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
C: CHANCE
D: Hello, Sophia.
E: being hugged
C: SOPHIE
D: Sophie, please - call me Sophie!
E: steps back, admires Chance
N: Sophie pulls them both into the party, leaving Dennis looking after Chance as he walks away.
C: SOPHIE
D: You just have to let me introduce you to some of the exciting people here... Why, Pat Boone and his daughter may drop by later!
E: CONT'D as they go, to Chance
N: They disappear into the crowd.
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
N: The President is hunched over his desk, absorbed in constructing a model airplane, a World War II flying fortress bomber. The First Lady sits nearby, plays solitaire on a small table. The President glances to her, then back to his work.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... How are the kids getting along?
E: gluing the wing
C: FIRST LADY
D: Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
C: PRESIDENT
D: Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
C: FIRST LADY
D: Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
C: PRESIDENT
D: Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
N: A KNOCK at the door interrupts the President.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... Yes, come in!
E: CONT'D calls out
N: Kaufman enters.
C: KAUFMAN
D: Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Oh? What?
C: KAUFMAN
D: We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Good. Anything else?
C: KAUFMAN
D: Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
N: The President nods, Kaufman leaves. The President puts some more glue on the wing.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
N: Sophie pulls Eve and Chance to AMBASSADOR SKRAPINOV and his WIFE. Skrapinov smiles as he sees Eve.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Mrs. Rand. How delightful.
N: Skrapinov kisses Eve's hand.
C: EVE
D: It seems like ages, Mr. Ambassador. Mrs. Skrapinov.
E: a nod to his wife
N: Mrs. Skrapinov returns the nod as Sophie introduces Chance.
C: SOPHIE
D: Mr. Gardiner, let me introduce you to our guest of honor, His Excellency Vladimar Skrapinov, Ambassador of the Soviet Union.
N: Chance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own.
C: CHANCE
D: Hello... His... His...
E: stumbles over name
C: SOPHIE
D: Ambassador Skrapinov, this is Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Delighted. Delighted.
C: SOPHIE
D: And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.
N: Chance smiles at Mrs. Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts an arm around him.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
C: CHANCE
D: I agree.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
E: to Eve
C: EVE
D: He's doing as well as could be expected, Mr. Ambassador. He still speaks of the stimulating discussions he's had with you.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Ah, Yes. Please give him my regards.
C: EVE
D: Of course.
C: SOPHIE
D: Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
E: tugs at Eve
C: EVE
D: Would you two excuse me for a moment?
E: to Chance and Skrapinov
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
C: EVE
D: I'll be back soon...
E: smiling
N: Eve and Sophie leave. Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to their table.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President. ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
E: as they walk quietly
C: CHANCE
D: Ben is very ill.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover. Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
E: arrive at table
N: Chance sits between Skrapinov and Mrs. Skrapinov.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
E: CONT'D moves chair close to Chance
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I agree, I think so too.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I understand.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
C: CHANCE
D: We are not far... ... our chairs almost touch.
E: an engaging smile motions at nearness of their chairs
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
E: laughs
C: CHANCE
D: I certainly do.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
C: CHANCE
D: Do you think so? Do you think so?
C: SKRAPINOV
D: So you know Krylov!
N: Skrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks softly in Russian. Chance, having never heard this language, raises his eyebrows and laughs. Mrs. Skrapinov remains impassive.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
E: CONT'D amazed
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, good.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Yes, it is very good!
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, it is. Would you tell me your name again, please?
E: beat
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
E: slaps Chance on the back
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I like that name very much.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner! How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
E: in Russian
N: As he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps Skrapinov on the shoulder.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Mrs. Rand! You have returned to us!
E: CONT'D immediately rises
C: EVE
D: Only to steal Mr. Gardiner away, if I might. Everyone wants to meet you.
E: to Chance
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Eve. That would be good.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
E: shakes Chance's hand
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you.
N: As Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a MAN standing a short distance away. The man, KARPATOV, hurries to the table.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Yes? What have you found?
C: KARPATOV
D: We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
E: in Russian
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
E: holds up hand, looks around
C: KARPATOV
D: Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
E: in English, softly
C: SKRAPINOV
D: What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
C: KARPATOV
D: There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
N: Mrs. Skrapinov strains to overhear the conversation.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
C: KARPATOV
D: Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
C: KARPATOV
D: Clearly, yes comrade.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Hmmm... Take this down. I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
E: Karpatov takes out notepad
C: KARPATOV
D: Very good, Your Excellency.
N: Karpatov leaves the table.
S: INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: The same lounge as before. Sidney Courtney sits at the same table as earlier, only this time with the editor of the Washington Post, LYMAN STUART. Courtney puffs on his pipe as he speaks.
C: COURTNEY
D: ... It's strictly rumor at this stage, Lyman - just something in the wind...
C: STUART
D: Something rather big in the wind, I'd say. So whose files were destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's?
C: COURTNEY
D: I don't know. Like I said, it's just rumor so far, but we should start nosing around, see if we can talk to some people...
N: The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.
C: STUART
D: ... But why? The question is why? Why would they destroy Gardiner's files? What is it about his past they are trying to cover up? ... A criminal record? A membership in a subversive organization? Homosexual, perhaps?
E: his voice fades
N: The SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas Franklin's as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and Franklin sitting at a table nearby.
C: FRANKLIN
D: ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
C: ALLENBY
D: I have no idea...
C: FRANKLIN
D: Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
C: ALLENBY
D: Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
C: FRANKLIN
D: Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
C: ALLENBY
D: I see. Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
E: leans close to Franklin
C: FRANKLIN
D: Of course, Doctor, I understand.
C: ALLENBY
D: Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
C: FRANKLIN
D: Certainly, glad to be of help.
N: Allenby rises, leaves the bar.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT
N: Eve and Sophie are talking to a small group. Chance moves away to get an hors d'oeuvre and is approached by RONALD STIEGLER, a publisher.
C: STIEGLER
D: Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
C: CHANCE
D: Hello, Ronald.
E: a two-handed handshake
C: STIEGLER
D: Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
C: CHANCE
D: I can't write.
C: STIEGLER
D: Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
E: smiles
C: CHANCE
D: I can't read.
C: STIEGLER
D: Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I like to watch.
C: STIEGLER
D: Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
C: CHANCE
D: What sort of bed is it?
E: mild interest
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Rand is in bed. Sitting nearby are two attorneys, MONROE and TOWNSEND. Mrs. Aubrey stands to one side and Constance and Teresa prepare an IV for Rand.
C: RAND
D: Everything. I said everything and that's exactly what I mean.
E: speaks slowly, with effort
C: MONROE
D: But, Mr. Rand, the holdings are so extensive, I would like to be more precise in...
C: RAND
D: What could be more precise than everything...?
E: interrupts
N: Allenby enters the room, stands by the door, unnoticed.
C: MONROE
D: Everything to Mrs. Rand.
E: turns to Townsend
C: TOWNSEND
D: Right - everything.
E: drafting a will
C: RAND
D: You two don't have to lecture me on the complexities of the situation, no one knows that better than myself... But you must understand that I have an endless faith in Mrs. Rand's abilities - I know that she will select the right person for guidance when she has the need... She has shared my life, gentlemen, she has given me far more pleasure than any of my so called assets... Life has suddenly become very simple for me now - I may be older than my years, and you might think me to be somewhat feeble... But I am still in love, gentlemen, thank God for that...
N: Allenby silently leaves the room.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - DINNER PARTY - NIGHT
N: Dennis Watson, of the State Department, talks with Chance in a corner of the living room. Dennis whispers something into Chance's ear and Chance gives him an innocent smile. Dennis is encouraged by the smile.
C: DENNIS
D: We could do it now, we can go upstairs. ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
E: no reaction from Chance
C: CHANCE
D: I like to watch.
E: blankly
C: DENNIS
D: Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I like to watch very much.
C: DENNIS
D: Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too. We can go this way.
E: takes Chance's arm
C: CHANCE
D: I want to tell Eve.
C: DENNIS
D: Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes.
C: DENNIS
D: Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
E: pulling Chance
N: Dennis leads Chance out of the crowded room.
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the darkened bedroom. The President and the First Lady are in bed. They each lie on their backs, a distance apart and are silent.
C: FIRST LADY
D: ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
E: after some time
C: PRESIDENT
D: No, that won't do any good.
C: FIRST LADY
D: ... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
E: another pause
C: PRESIDENT
D: Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
C: FIRST LADY
D: It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
E: another pause
C: PRESIDENT
D: It's not that, I just...
N: The inter-White House phone rings, the President reaches for it.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?
E: CONT'D into phone
C: KAUFMAN'S VOICE
D: Chief, we have a break in the case. Our man at the Washington Post says they are working on a story that either the CIA or the FBI destroyed Gardiner's files before anyone could get to them.
E: over phone
C: PRESIDENT
D: What? Why?
C: KAUFMAN'S VOICE
D: I can't say at this time - neither agency will admit to a thing.
E: over phone
C: PRESIDENT
D: Okay, get both Directors over here, I'll be right down.
E: getting out of bed
N: The President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares at the ceiling.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT
N: A small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry. The lights are very dim, and Dennis, who we cannot see, is lying on the floor. Dennis' clothes are draped over a chair. Chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk. He turns the TV on.
C: DENNIS' VOICE
D: Can you see well?
E: softly
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, very well, thank you.
E: squints at small screen
C: DENNIS' VOICE
D: Do you like it?
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
C: DENNIS' VOICE
D: ... Are you sure you like it?
E: disappointed at it being 'tiny'
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, I do, it's very good.
C: DENNIS' VOICE
D: Really? Really!!!
E: excited
N: Chance reacts to the change in tone of Dennis' voice, turns to look at him on the floor. Hearing the groans and heavy breathing, Chance thinks Dennis is ill.
C: CHANCE
D: Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
C: DENNIS' VOICE
D: I don't want Robert.
C: CHANCE
D: I see.
C: DENNIS' VOICE
D: Your foot! Give me your foot!!
E: through the groans
N: Dennis reaches out with his free hand, grabs Chance's foot, pulls it to himself.
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you. But my leg is still a little sore.
E: some pain
N: Chance watches as Dennis goes through some spasms, then his body relaxes. Chance is concerned for Dennis' health.
C: CHANCE
D: Are you sure you're not ill?
E: CONT'D
N: We hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor.
S: EXT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT
N: A long, black limousine with a Red Star on the door pulls away from Sophie's house.
S: INT. RED STAR LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
N: ALEXIS NOVOGROD, a high-ranking KGB officer, and two of his underlings are in the limousine, along with Skrapinov, his wife and Karpatov. Novogrod and his men wear heavy clothing, fresh from Moscow. They all drink vodka. (Dialogue in Russian, English subtitles)
C: NOVOGROD
D: The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: That could be possible...
C: NOVOGROD
D: But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
C: NOVOGROD
D: That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
C: NOVOGROD
D: You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
C: SKRAPINOV
D: Thank you, Colonel.
C: NOVOGROD
D: Let us toast to the success of the coup.
E: raising his glass
N: They all raise their glasses.
C: GROUP TOAST
D: Na zdorov'e!
N: The men and Mrs. Skrapinov drink their vodkas.
S: INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The reception is breaking up. Eve, wearing her coat, searches for Chance in the crowd. She sees him, taps him on the shoulder from behind.
C: EVE
D: Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
C: CHANCE
D: No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
C: EVE
D: Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
C: CHANCE
D: He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
C: EVE
D: It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
N: Eve and Chance leave the reception.
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
N: The President sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his hair mussed. Standing before him are GROVER HONEYCUTT, the Director of the F.B.I., and CLIFFORD BALDWIN, C.I.A. Chief. Kaufman stands to one side. All are red-eyed, tired, and frustrated.
T: HONEYCUTT
N: I never gave such a directive, Mr. President.
C: BALDWIN
D: Nor I, sir - it would be out of the question.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
C: BALDWIN
D: Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
N: There is silence in the room. A couple of looks, but silence.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I see. What about question three? Is it possible to erase all traces of a man?
E: CONT'D
T: HONEYCUTT
N: Highly unlikely, sir... In fact, the boys around the Bureau feel that the only person capable of pulling it off would be an ex F.B.I. man.
C: BALDWIN
D: I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
E: a look to Honeycutt
C: PRESIDENT
D: And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
E: to Baldwin
C: BALDWIN
D: Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations. Good night.
E: rising goes to door
N: The President leaves the Oval Office.
S: INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Eve and Chance walk down the hallway.
C: EVE
D: I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey... ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
E: holding his hand stops at her bedroom door
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
C: EVE
D: ... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
E: opens her door
C: CHANCE
D: Thank you.
N: Chance enters, Eve closes the door behind them.
S: INT. EVE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Eve turns on a soft lamp, Chance goes directly to her TV, turns it on.
C: EVE
D: I can sense that you've been through a lot, Chauncey. But one day, when you feel like it, you'll tell me all about your life... ... But, even if you tell me nothing, even if it's too painful for you to reveal your past...
E: Chance watches an old movie
N: As she talks, Chance watches a love scene on TV. The hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind. He abruptly turns, takes Eve into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth. Just as abruptly, he turns away and changes channels on TV.
C: EVE
D: Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so much!
E: breathless
N: She takes Chance in her arms, kisses him wildly. They fall to her bed in an embrace. As she holds him, kisses him, runs her hands over his body, Chance watches television, neither resists nor responds to Eve's caresses. Suddenly she stops, lets her head fall on Chance's chest.
C: EVE
D: ... You don't want me, Chauncey... You don't feel anything for me... Nothing at all...
E: CONT'D
N: Chance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently strokes her hair as he looks at TV.
C: EVE
D: I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: I like to watch.
C: EVE
D: To watch...? To watch me...?
E: not understanding
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I like to watch.
C: EVE
D: ... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...?
E: uncertain a hesitation
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. It's very good, Eve.
C: EVE
D: ... But I've never done... ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
E: another hesitation
N: Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom as Chance watches TV. She makes a decision, moves to Chance, kisses him.
C: EVE
D: Oh, Chauncey...
E: CONT'D getting aroused
N: She steps back, slips off her dress. She does not undress any further, instead, leans close to Chance.
C: EVE
D: One of those little things you don't know about me yet, darling - I'm a little shy.
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles, gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself. Chance divides his attention between Eve and the TV, watching both with an equal detachment. Eve begins to respond to her own touch, finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her own body. Chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm. As Eve's body trembles, Chance yawns, gets up from the bed.
C: CHANCE
D: Good night, Eve.
E: going to door
N: A low purr is heard from Eve as Chance leaves.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
N: Allenby, Constance and Teresa are readying a transfusion for Rand. There is a feeling of urgency as they work. Rand, very weak, strains to speak to Allenby.
C: RAND
D: No more, Robert... No more needles...
C: ALLENBY
D: It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
E: sits on the side of the bed
C: RAND
D: I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
N: Teresa is about to swab Rand's arm with alcohol but he pulls away.
C: RAND
D: No, I don't want any of that... Please... please, just get me Mr. Gardiner, Teresa - please... he'll head it up...
E: CONT'D
N: Teresa looks to Allenby, he nods to her. Teresa puts the cotton down, leaves the room.
S: EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - MORNING
N: A light snow is failing. Eve is in a fur coat, holds a steaming cup of coffee. Chance stands next to her, an umbrella in one hand. He holds his other arm out, catching the snowflakes as they fall.
C: EVE
D: ... And I feel so free now, Chauncey. Until I met you, I never felt acknowledged by a man... ... I always had the feeling that I was just a vessel for a man, someone that he could take hold of, pierce, and pollute. I was merely an aspect of somebody's lovemaking. Do you know what I mean?
E: Chance gazes out at the falling snow
N: Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold snowflakes to his face.
C: EVE
D: Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
E: CONT'D presses close to him
C: CHANCE
D: That's very interesting, Eve.
N: Teresa appears in the doorway.
C: TERESA
D: Mr. Gardiner. Mr. Rand would like to see you.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I would like to see Ben.
N: Chance gives Eve a warm smile, then follows Teresa into the house.
S: INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
N: Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's life, sits on the bed close to him, grips his hand tightly. Teresa shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses to leave. As they do, Chance, once again breathing the oxygen with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside.
C: RAND
D: ... Chauncey... Chauncey...
E: slowly
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
N: Allenby winces.
C: RAND
D: ... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
E: a weak smile
C: CHANCE
D: Oh, I see.
C: RAND
D: Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength... Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
E: reaches out to him holds Chance's hand
C: CHANCE
D: A flower...
E: smiling
C: RAND
D: She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I would like to do that.
C: RAND
D: ... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
N: Rand slumps down, dead. Allenby checks his pulse, turns to Chance.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... He's gone, Chauncey.
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
C: ALLENBY
D: Yes, I suppose that's true.
E: covers Rand's face
N: Chance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches the man's forehead, feels the coldness. Allenby eyes him as Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet.
C: CHANCE
D: Will you be leaving now, Robert?
E: turns to Allenby
C: ALLENBY
D: In a day or two, yes.
C: CHANCE
D: Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
C: ALLENBY
D: ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr... ... Chance...?
E: a moment, a look a beat
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I love Eve very much.
C: ALLENBY
D: I see... ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
E: another beat
C: CHANCE
D: Yes, Robert - I am. I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
E: brightens a smile at Allenby
N: Chance leaves the bedroom. Allenby watches him go, then sits back in a chair, his head spinning.
S: EXT. RAND MANSION - DAY
N: A cloudy, cold day patches of snow are on the ground. The Rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to funeral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers. PAN AROUND, reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking the mansion. Fifty mourners are gathered around the Rand family mausoleum. Chance stands with Eve and Allenby. The President of the United States stands before a microphone.
C: PRESIDENT
D: ... Millions of people across the world have heard of the passing of Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately, only relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss. To most, Benjamin Rand was a legend; to those of us gathered here today, Benjamin was a beloved friend. My personal association with Benjamin dates back many years, and my memories of our friendship will stay with me forever.
N: As the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away. Eve and Allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I initially came in contact with the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a young lieutenant in the Air Corps, a navigator flying missions over Europe. That plane that I learned to know so well was manufactured by the Rand Aeronautics Corporation. Benjamin Rand was an industrial giant, known to be powerful and uncompromising, and yet, on a personal level, we have all felt his warmth and humor... ... I would like to share with you a few quotes, and a few feelings from our dear friend. ... 'I do not regret having political differences with men that I respect; I do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart.' ... 'I have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever... But, if I am to be honest with myself, I must admit that they have no use for me, either.' ... 'I was born into a position of extreme wealth, I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty - I do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world. For a man in my position, that is inexcusable.' 'Life is a state of mind.' ... 'When I was a boy, I was told that the Lord fashioned us from his own image. That's when I decided to manufacture mirrors.'
E: CONT'D a beat a beat holds up paper, reads
S: INT. LARGE AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Ah auditorium with row upon row of empty seats. Huddled together at one end of the hall are six important businessmen, speaking in hushed tones. JAMES DUDLEY, a powerful industrialist, speaks.
C: DUDLEY
D: But what do we know of the man? Nothing! We have no inkling of his past!
N: SEWELL NELSON, a corporation chairman, joins in.
C: NELSON
D: Correct, and that is an asset. A man's past can cripple him, his background turns into a swamp and invites scrutiny.
T: Another executive, PETER CALDWELL, agrees.
C: CALDWELL
D: To this time, he hasn't said anything that could be used against him.
N: CHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;
C: BENNET
D: Well, I'm certainly open to the thought - it would be sheer lunacy to support the President for another term.
C: NELSON
D: No one will go along with that... Look at the facts, gentlemen, the response from his appearance on 'This Evening' was overwhelming; he has excited and awakened the people of this country at a time of despair.
N: LYMAN MURRAY, a banker;
C: MURRAY
D: He's personable, elusive, yet seemingly honest. He's riding a crest of popularity that builds with every statement. As far as his thinking goes, he appears to be one of us. I firmly believe, gentlemen, that he is our only chance - Mr. Chauncey Gardiner!
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: Chance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods.
S: EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
N: The services are over. Eve, Allenby talk with the President and the First Lady.
C: EVE
D: It was very moving, Bobby - thank you so much...
C: PRESIDENT
D: We're all going to miss him, Eve... ... Where's Mr. Gardiner?
E: glances around
C: ALLENBY
D: ... He walked off...
C: EVE
D: Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
C: PRESIDENT
D: I can certainly understand that...
C: FIRST LADY
D: Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
C: EVE
D: Thank you, Nancy.
C: FIRST LADY
D: I'll call you soon.
N: The President and First Lady head toward their limousine.
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: Chance walks deeper into the woods, absorbed in the greenery. He stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves on.
S: EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
N: The majority of mourners have left. Eve and Allenby walk slowly to the RAND 1 limousine, look around for Chance.
C: EVE
D: ... Do you think we should look for him?
C: ALLENBY
D: I don't think so, he should be along soon...
C: EVE
D: I wish he were here...
N: Eve keeps looking as they walk to the limousine.
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the ground. He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along the split in the bark. He looks to the ground, notices that an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it double. Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the seedling. He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and, with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the seedling. Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree. He unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way to give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light from the winter sun. Chance stands, puts his gloves back on and continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of the woods.
S: EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
N: Jeffrey stands holding the door for Eve and Allenby, all the other cars have gone. Eve is worried, gets into the car.
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: Chance walks through the woods, his pace faster than before.
S: EXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
N: The limousine still waits for Chance.
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
N: Eve is deeply concerned for Chance.
C: EVE
D: We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
C: ALLENBY
D: You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
C: EVE
D: I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
C: ALLENBY
D: I think we'd better go look for him. David!
E: he taps on the glass partition
N: David starts up the limousine.
S: EXT. WOODS - DAY
N: Chance walks with determination through the woods.
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
N: Allenby and Eve search for Chance as David drives along a narrow road through the woods. Jeffrey, sitting in front, suddenly calls out.
C: JEFFREY
D: Look!
N: About 100 yards ahead of them, Chance crosses the road, continues on down a hill.
C: EVE
D: There he is! Chauncey!
N: David stops the limousine at the point where Chance crossed. Eve hurries out of the car.
S: EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - DAY
N: Chance is about twenty yards down the side of a hill. Eve calls to him.
C: EVE
D: Chauncey! Chauncey!
C: CHANCE
D: Hello, Eve.
E: stops, looks up
N: Eve runs, half falls as she goes down the hill.
C: EVE
D: Oh, Chauncey...!
N: She gets to him, holds him tightly.
C: EVE
D: Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
E: CONT'D
C: CHANCE
D: Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
N: She hugs him one more time, then she leads him back up the hill to the waiting limousine. Allenby gets out of the car, greets Chance with a handshake and an arm around the shoulder. Then the three get into the limousine.
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
