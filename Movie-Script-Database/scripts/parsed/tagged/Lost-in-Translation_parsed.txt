T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: The back of a GIRL in pink underwear, she leans at a big window, looking out over Tokyo.
T: CUT TO:
N: Melodramatic music swells over the Girl's butt in pink sheer underwear as she lies on the bed. TITLE CARDS OVER IMAGE. LOST IN TRANSLATION
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: POV from a car window - the colors and lights of Tokyo neon at night blur by.
T: CUT TO:
N: In the backseat of a Presidential limousine, BOB (late- forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, staring out the window. P.O.V. from car window- We see buildings covered in bright signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of whiskey in a Suntory ad... more signs, a huge TV with perky Japanese pop stars singing.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT
N: Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky rise. The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out. Eager BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT
N: Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by Japanese businessmen below his shoulders. The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt. Bob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo. The CONCIERGE and several eager HOTEL MANAGERS greet Bob. He just wants to sleep, but more STAFF continue to greet him, ask him about his fright. They lead him to reception.
S: INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT
N: At the reception area four JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and two WOMEN quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend handshakes and gifts. They bow and introduce themselves from the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him enthusiastically. More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his stay. One of them presents a fax that has come for him. INSERT - "TO: BOB HARRIS FROM: LYDIA HARRIS YOU FORGOT ADAM'S BIRTHDAY. I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND. HAVE A GOOD TRIP, L" He doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his pocket. The commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him up, and ask if he needs anything else. Some JAPANESE ROCK STARS with shag haircuts and skinny leather pants pass by. Each commercial person has to shake Bob's hand before leaving.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bob sits on the end of the bed in a too small hotel kimono.
S: INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT
N: Bob sits at the bar. A few minutes pass as he sits in silence looking around, drinking a scotch. Chet Baker sings "The Thrill is Gone" over the stereo. We see Bob's POV of tables of people talking. JAPANESE WOMEN SMOKING, AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN tying one on, talking about software sales. A WAITER carefully setting down a coaster, and pouring a beer very, very slowly. It's all very foreign.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
N: The automatic hotel curtains open, pouring light into the room.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT.HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
N: Bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of Tokyo. The shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it goes, and leans down to have a shower. This hotel was not designed with him in mind.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STUDIO - DAY
N: Whiskey commercial shoot. The set is full of activity as the JAPANESE CREW work. Bob, in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a European style bar set with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. A JAPANESE GIRL quickly powders his face as they adjust lights and the DIRECTOR and crew speak in hurried Japanese. The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long sentences in Japanese. TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, translates but it is only a short sentence now.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: He wants you to turn, look in camera and say the lines.
N: Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it works from Japanese to English.
C: BOB
D: That's all he said?
C: TRANSLATOR
D: Yes, turn to camera.
N: Bob thinks let's just get it over with.
C: BOB
D: Turn left or right?
N: The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director answers her in a long excited phrase.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: Right side. And with intensity.
C: BOB
D: Is that everything? It seemed like he was saying a lot more.
N: The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: Like an old friend, and into the camera.
C: DIRECTOR
D: ) Suntory Time!
E: to Bob
N: They get ready, and roll camera: Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:
C: BOB
D: For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time.
N: The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The translator nods.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: Could you do it slower, and with more intensity?
C: BOB
D: Okay.
N: The Translator answers for him in four sentences. ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line.
C: BOB
D: For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT
N: Shinjuku High rises sparkle.
S: INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT
N: Tall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city. A sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays. Bob sits alone with a scotch at the bar. Some drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over their shoulders recognize him.
C: BUSINESS GUY
D: Hey- you're Bob Harris- you're awesome, man.
C: ANOTHER BUSINESS GUY
D: Yeah, I love Sunset Odds! BOB Oh, Ok, thanks.
C: BUSINESS GUY
D: Man, that car chase-
N: Bob nods.
S: INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bob comes back to his room. The maids have left everything perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups in nature while sad violin music plays. It's supposed to be relaxing, but it's just sad.
T: CUT TO:
N: Bob lies in bed. He flips through TV channels from the remote control. He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese. He turns it off as he hears a knock at the door. He goes to the door, and opens it part way.
C: WOMAN
D: Mr. Harris?
E: O.C. Raspy Japanese voice
C: BOB
D: Yes?
C: WOMAN
D: Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
C: BOB
D: Oh?
C: WOMAN
D: Can I enter?
N: He pauses, then opens the door. A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt and stockings comes in. She is wearing '60s style make-up. Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her. Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte Bardot sing "Bonnie & Clyde". The woman turns slyly around and shimmies over to Bob.
C: WOMAN
D: Mr. Harris?
E: as she tries to undress him
C: BOB
D: Yes?
C: WOMAN
D: Do you like massage?
C: BOB
D: I don't think so.
C: WOMAN
D: Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
N: She pushes him back onto the bed. He hesitates, but then goes along with it passively.
C: WOMAN
D: My stockings.
C: BOB
D: Yes?
C: WOMAN
D: Take them.
N: He fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.
C: WOMAN
D: No - Lip them... Don't touch me!
N: He takes his hands back confused.
C: WOMAN
D: Lip my stockings!
N: He backs away, as he tries to understand her.
C: WOMAN
D: Lip them!
N: She throws her leg up to him on the bed.
C: BOB
D: Huh?
N: She pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands.
C: BOB
D: Oh, you want me to rip them?
N: He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just snap. She pretends to struggle.
C: WOMAN
D: Please let me go!
N: He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense.
C: WOMAN
D: Let me go!
N: She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know what she wants. She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black.
C: BOB
D: I think you should leave.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
N: In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At another table a JAPANESE COUPLE in sunglasses chain smoke and drink coffee.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY
N: Bob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his stay. In the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding. Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands out in the crowd. She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the elevator doors. Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave.
C: MISS KAWASAKI
D: Mr. Harris
N: He is approached by a group of eight excited people from the commercial company there waiting to take him.
C: PRESS AGENT
D: We just got a request from Tanabe Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan! It is a big honor to be invited to his show.
E: as they are on their way
N: Bob feigns enthusiasm briefly.
C: MISS KAWASAKI
D: Can you stay until Friday?
C: BOB
D: I'll have to see about that.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PHOTO STUDIO - DAY
N: Bob's back is to us as a MAKE-UP ARTIST is putting some final touches on him. The PHOTOGRAPHER is giving her enthusiastic direction in Japanese. Bob talks on his cell phone, not paying attention to the make-up artist.
C: BOB
D: Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
C: ELAINE
D: We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
E: O.S.
C: BOB
D: Yeah, they told me.
C: ELAINE
D: These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
E: O.S.
C: BOB
D: Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
C: ELAINE
D: Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
E: O.S.
C: BOB
D: Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
N: He hangs up. The make-up artist dusts him with powder. The commercial people are crowding around. Bob's chair is swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner. In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory. small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty dutch camera moves. The agency people crowd around. The photographer is excited and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Can you put hands close to face.
N: The photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands at his face.
C: BOB
D: Urn, I don't think so. How bout I just hold the bottle.
N: The photographer starts shooting. Bob obviously hates the whole thing, what you do for money.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT
N: Bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits alone having a drink. A JAZZ BAND FROM SAUSALITO performs. The SINGER is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed in red, and takes her singing very seriously. She sings a slow version of "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme". C.U. - a golden beer is poured very slowly. Bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away. Across the bar, Charlotte sits with JOHN, her husband (he is in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and some FRIENDS - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people (all smoking). One of them, CHARLIE, in a shiny suit, keeps taking pictures, and showing them magazine layouts.
C: JAZZ SINGER
D: Thank you. We're glad to be here, we're Sausalito.
N: Charlotte laughs and looks down, the Japanese audience clap very seriously... she and Bob catch eyes - about Sausalito and how weird it is there.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ELEVATOR - LATER
N: The mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close- up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had forgotten about. He looks at himself.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Charlotte lays close to her young husband, John. She looks to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly. She leans her chin on his shoulder.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Are you awake?
N: He doesn't answer.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: John?
N: He grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, and grabs her under the covers. He kisses her.
C: JOHN
D: Go to sleep.
N: He holds her close, but she can't sleep.
T: CUT TO:
N: Charlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings. The sun is starting to come up. Below she watches cars going places.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Bob lies in bed awake. The clock says 4:20. The in-room fax machine is making noise as a fax rolls in. Bob looks at the fax machine but doesn't get out of bed. The fax curls and falls to the floor. CLOSE ON FAX - "BOB- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHICH SHELVES YOU WANT IN YOUR STUDY. PLEASE PICK ONE OUT AND LET ME KNOW. I'M HAVING LOTS OF QUALITY TIME WITH THE CONSTRUCTION CREW. HOPE YOU'RE HAVING FUN THERE. LOVE, L" Three pages of shelf diagrams follow.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL GYM - NIGHT
N: The gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming. Bob passes piles of little towels and bottles of water. He takes a water for his workout. He approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the drink holder of the machine. He looks at the lit-up instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese. He pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese. He gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot peddles coordinate. He pushes a button and it starts moving too fast. In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control panel, but is not fast enough. The soothing woman's voice continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an English word- gently, gently...vigorous) He tries to keep up with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards instead.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY
N: The agency group wait for Bob. They stand up as he approaches from the elevator, trying to mask a slight limp.
C: BOB
D: Good morning.
E: everything's fine
N: Miss Kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave the hotel.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHIBUYA STATION - DAY
N: Charlotte gets out at shibuya station, a crowded neighborhood filled with neon, ads, and people. She looks up at the huge intersection as tons of JAPANESE PEOPLE wait to cross the street, no one steps forward until the cross-walk light changes, and all of them cross. A TV screen covering a building plays commercials. She roams around the narrow streets, crowded with stylish JAPANESE KIDS, tan SCHOOLGIRLS pass her.
T: CUT TO:
N: Charlotte wanders down a crowded street, looking around. On a small side street she stops at a little park. She watches a JAPANESE MAN AND WOMAN together: CHARLOTTE'S POV - C.U. The man reaches his hand to the back of the woman's neck, and leans in close. The woman smiles at him, in love.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: John is sound asleep. Charlotte is awake next to him. She looks at the clock - it's three a.m. She slides close to him, kisses his mouth. He grumbles something in his deep sleep, and rolls over. She goes to the couch, stepping over camera equipment. She looks at the fruit basket, decides to try an apple. She has a piece but isn't really hungry. She reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine, but she's already looked at it a few times before. She decides to go downstairs.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT
N: Bob sits alone at the bar. Charlotte sits down a seat away from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he turns and finds her next to him. They look at each other. A young BARTENDER with a sweet face tends to them.
C: BARTENDER
D: What can I get you?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I'm not sure.

C: CHARLOTTE
D: Oh.
N: She lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I'll just have a beer.
N: He makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days.
C: BOB
D: What about you? Why are you here?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
C: BOB

C: BOB
D: I'm thinking about it.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
C: BOB
D: Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois, and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.

C: BOB
D: Oh, what do you do with that?
C: CHARLOTTE

C: CHARLOTTE
D: I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
N: The hotel is filled with business people. A dressed up FAMILY is going to lunch. We follow a jet-lagged Charlotte and John, as they walk down the lobby hall. An energetic blonde actress, KELLY, pops up to them. (She's carrying a copy of Memoirs of a Geisha.) John, who was holding Charlotte's hand, drops it.

C: CHARLOTTE

C: JOHN
D: I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.

S: INT. HOTEL POOL - DAY
N: An Olympic pool is framed by tall glass walls with the Tokyo view. Bob is handed a swim cap and goggles. Bob watches a Japanese BUSINESSMAN swimming, he looks like an over-grown baby. Bob swims laps in the pristine pool. He continues his laps. Under water he sees the jumping legs of MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY
N: Charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on, listening to a book on tape. After a corny music intro, a very serious scholar man's voice speaks clearly : DR. KENGARD (0.S.) Did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is? This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear. The acorn theory is an example of each soul beginning with an imprint.... Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling like a loser listening to a self-help tape. She looks at the doctor's photo on the audio-book box, he's bald, in a turtleneck and glasses.
T: CUT TO:

She sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which is in the midst of a press conference. Cameras flash as Kelly, with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions enthusiastically. KELLY You know, barbecuing, and yoga, and I love taking my dogs, Buster and Lulu, for walks on the beach... and it was great learning karate for "Midnight Racer" - I did all my own stunts! The JAPANESE JOURNALISTS seem excited by her answer. Kelly throws a Karate punch for a PHOTOGRAPHER.

She watches as they delicately arrange the tiny flowers. The INSTRUCTOR hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings. Alongside the women, Charlotte tries to follow along.

So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food.
C: JOHN
D: Oh, that's too bad.
E: trying
N: Charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray, and she watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a WAITER.

N: DJ Clean starts doing a human beat box at her. Charlotte looks over at Kelly.
C: KELLY
D: ...Oh my god you have to try it, this power cleanse is amazing- it's lemon juice and grade B maple syrup and cayenne pepper for seven days. Just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne. The first few days you're a little scattered, but by day four - it's amazing... my eyes were so white...
N: Charlotte excuses herself. She passes Bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she is leaving.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Hi again, how's it going?

C: JOHN
D: At the fitting, they had all these rock n roll clothes, the label guys kept saying lock n loll, though, but the band doesn't look tough at all...they look better just skinny and nerdy, like how when they came in...they looked so uncomfortable in these Keith Richards clothes, they should just be like they are, don't you think?

C: BOB
D: Hi, Charlie.
N: They shake hands.
C: CHARLOTTE

She picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a few times before. She hears something and goes over to the door. On her way, she passes her red T. Anthony suitcase overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in it. A HOTEL MESSAGE envelope is slipped under the door.

D: No, yes, it does...
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Yeah? But look at you.
C: BOB
D: Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
C: BOB
D: You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: But, I'm mean.
C: BOB
D: That's ok.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: And marriage, does that get easier?
C: BOB
D: It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Did that help? Did you learn anything?
C: BOB
D: We established that we have no communication.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Oh.
C: BOB
D: We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: That's too scary.
C: BOB
D: When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: No one ever tells you that...
E: getting tired
C: BOB
D: But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
C: BOB
D: Where'd you grow up?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his stubble and sees that it's turning grey. He opens the hotel shaving kit. He squirts shaving cream from the child-size can. Even the razor is small. He covers his face with shaving cream when the phone rings.
C: BOB
D: Hello?

S: EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY

S: EXT/INT. ICHICAN SUSHI - DAY
N: Bob finally finds the small restaurant. The automatic door opens for him, and Charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby SUSHI CHEF, turns to Bob happy to see him. He is disheveled from the rain and adorable. He sits down next to Charlotte, she pours him a beer and orders for him.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: You made it.
C: BOB
D: They really have to work on that street name thing.
N: A perky recording voice says "Kornichiwa!" from his pocket.
C: CHARLOTTE

C: BOB
D: It's for my daughter.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: How old is she?
C: BOB
D: Four.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Oh, she'll love it.
N: The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf. Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. Bob makes fun of her gracelessness.
C: BOB
D: Nice one.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Fuck off.
E: mouth full
N: They have lunch, he makes her laugh. He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple.
C: BOB
D: What happened to your toe?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
N: She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue.
C: BOB
D: That doesn't look good.
N: She enjoys the sympathy.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: It's bad isn't it?
C: BOB
D: We should get you to the doctor.
C: CHARLOTTE

C: BOB
D: Yeah, look at that thing.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DAIKANYAMA STREET - DAY
N: Bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in. He tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a first aid cross, but the DRIVER doesn't understand. Charlotte is enjoying Bob's effort. Finally he finds a Park Hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel number.

E: V.O. voice-mail message
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Bob's cab pulls up at an empty office building.
S: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Bob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if he's in the right place. It's quiet and looks like a generic office building. He goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never thought was there.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ORANGE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
N: Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms through the speakers. Tan JAPANESE STRIPPERS with platinum hair dance and hang from a pole on a little platform. Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of place and empty. He looks over at a table of young AMERICAN INVESTMENT BROKERS. He wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable. Charlotte shows up with Charlie and the other guys. She sits down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill me?' look.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: How long have you been here?
N: He looks at her like it's been forever. She smiles for forgiveness. They look over and see a WEIRD GUY in the corner getting a lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it. Through a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances in a dark corner of pillows. Charlotte looks at Bob.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: C'mon, let's go.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TOKYO STREETS - NIGHT
N: Bob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses them. They don't know why, but just make their way down an empty side street. Little plastic cherry blossom decorations hang above them.
C: BOB
D: Where's your husband?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Working.
E: like she's said it a million times
C: BOB
D: Do you ever see him?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Yeah.
E: sorta
C: BOB
D: Do you know where we are?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: No.
N: She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake "one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs...
N: They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street.
T: FADE OUT:
S: INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY - NIGHT
N: As they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. It's late, it's pretty empty, a housekeeper vacuums and just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, the blonde actress, singing to them. She stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "Nobody Does It Better" with all her heart. Bob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying to be invisible).
T: FADE IN:
S: INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
N: Charlotte lies in bed. She picks up a photo next to the bed as she dials the phone.- The picture is of her and John on their honeymoon. The phone answers - it's a weird Japanese recording.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I'm not sure...I'm going to go to Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you when I get back. Hope it's going good... I love you, bye.

S: EXT. KYOTO - DAY
N: Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small figure in the landscape. She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono walk under a parasol with their family. Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them. Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up.
T: CUT TO:
N: She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves. At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine. At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

D: We hear you're quite a golfer.
E: in Japanese
N: A TRANSLATOR translates.
C: BOB
D: I enjoy the sport.
E: nodding
N: The Translator translates - four sentences longer and with added enthusiasm. After a few questions the Host excitedly announces something to the AUDIENCE in Japanese. They scream, the lights flash, Bob has no idea what's going on. A cloud of smoke reveals the IRON CHEF, with feathered hair, wearing an 18th century waistcoat. A large red chef hat is placed on Bob's head.
C: TRANSLATOR
D: They now have the competition for you with the Iron Chef.
N: Bob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now Bob and the Iron Chef are at dueling counters. The Host barks instructions in Japanese, an apron with a stuffed animal lobster on it is tied around Bob, the crowd cheers - there's no way out.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT

S: INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT
N: Melodramatic '70s Japanese music plays. Bob sits alone, hating himself, at the bar. The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, and a seat next to him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BOB'S ROOM - MORNING
N: In the harsh-morning light, Bob wakes up in his bed. He hears the Jazz Singer singing in the shower "Midnight at the Oasis". Her red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room service. She seems to have taken over the whole room. He wants it all to go away. She walks off to the bathroom and there's a knock at the door. Bob rushes to get it before she can. He opens the door a crack, Charlotte looking sweet, is standing there. Her hair is back in a pony-tail. Bob's just wearing a towel around his waist, and his hair is sticking up.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Rough night?
N: He's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates himself, doesn't need more help.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
C: BOB
D: Yes, but no, I can't right now.
N: The singer starts singing again in the background. Charlotte gives Bob a look.

C: CHARLOTTE
D: The Jazz singer? The red-head?
N: Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Well, I guess she's more around your age... You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
C: BOB
D: You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
N: She scowls at him. The waitress brings them drinks- she pours beer slowly, and turns on a pot on the table to cook their food. Charlotte looks at the menu - it is filled with photos of different trays of meat. The waitress doesn't speak English.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I can't tell the difference?
N: They have trouble ordering, but point to a picture on the menu.
C: BOB
D: We'll have two of these.
N: He makes some small talk, she is bugged.
C: BOB
D: What do you want to drink?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: A coke.
N: He orders the drinks.
C: BOB
D: So, where'd you go today.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Around.
N: "This is the End" by The Doors starts playing on the stereo. The waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef. Steam rises from the pot on the table. The song ends, and another Doors song comes on.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: They're not going to play the whole album, are they?
N: They look across the table, over the steam and meat, at each other- the whole thing is awful.

C: NEW SINGER
D: Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and we're thrilled to be joining you this week, here at the NY bar in Shinjuku.

C: BOB
D: Why can't it last?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
N: (alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality changes things...and we can't stay here forever) He looks over at her. The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there together, the view sparkling.
C: SINGER
D: Somethings that happen for the first time, seem to be happening again and so it seems we have met before, and laughed before, and loved before, but who knows where or when...

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: Bob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: 54?
N: He nods, she pushes 54 for him and 56 for herself. They look at each other across the empty elevator, both leaning against the walls. The elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night. They kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to their mouths. The door shuts- he missed his floor. The elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. They kiss good-night again and she gets out before the door closes. He watches the door close on her as she makes her way down the long beige hall.

Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, and super tan JAPANESE KIDS. In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte.
