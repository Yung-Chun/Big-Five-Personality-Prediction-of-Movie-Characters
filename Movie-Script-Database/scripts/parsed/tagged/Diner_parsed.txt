N: The SCREEN IS BLACK. We hear MUFFLED ROCK and ROLL MUSIC. Then we read: BALTIMORE
T: FADE OUT. :FADE IN:
S: INT. DANCE HALL BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: FENWICK walks along the dimly lit basement. Heavy wiatei coats hang from hooks on the wall. In the b.g., there is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the rest rooms. From above we hear the MUFFLED SOtJV OF THE
C: ROCK AND ROLL BAND.
D: Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the "JOE COLLEGE." style of the late fifties. Sports jacket, button- down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns. We sense that he is a little lost in himself, confused. He looks out one of the windows that views the parking lot. Then without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a window pane. Seconds later he breaks another window with his fist.
N: Fenwick, picking up the music beat from above, struts to the sound as he approaches another bank of windows. He calmly breaks another window pane with. his fist. A GUY coming out of the bathroom in the b.g . sees Fenwick's actions and then heads up the steps.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT
N: The crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to the local group, the SH K RS, playing their popular hit HOT NUTS. The song is played toward the end of the even- ing because of its risque Lyrics.
C: BAND LEADER
D: Hot nuts, hot nuts, get from the peanut man.
N: BAND LEADER (CONT' D) Hot nuts hot nuts, get em any - way you can. As the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader. The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches BOOGIE. Boogie is something of a "Dandy," flashiar in dress than others in his crowd. Although he isn't particularly good looking there is something about his attitude that is very appealing to girls. Boogie aster hearing the Guy heads downstairs.
