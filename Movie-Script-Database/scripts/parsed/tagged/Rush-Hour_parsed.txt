T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY
N: The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and wake me up.
S: EXT. LAX - DAY
N: The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly with stretch limousines.
S: INT. LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY
N: Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears. They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:
C: REPORTER
D: Eager to mend its tarnished image, Los Angeles has really put out the welcome mat for tomorrow's summit. The city promises quite a party as leaders from Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, the U.S. and others begin talks for the largest free-trade treaty in history.
E: to TV CAMERA
N: The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries arriving. Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.
C: REPORTER
D: The one sour note is North Korea, the only Pacific Rim country not participating. There are rumors of secret meetings with North Korean representatives, but U.S. officials insist the North must first hold democratic elections, and halt its nuclear weapons program -- as they claimed to have done back in 1995.
E: VO continuing
N: We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL. Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ. The SCENE returns to LAX.
C: REPORTER
D: Tensions remain high since last year's skirmishes between North Korea and the U.S. So any chance of the communist North joining the Pacific Partners seems highly unlikely.
E: VO continuing
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FREMONT PLACE - DAY
N: An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought- iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean, next to the entranceway: Consulate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
N: An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS. He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.
S: EXT. UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY
N: From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place. HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood. BACK TO SCENE The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray. Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to a van with a phone company logo on it.
S: EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
N: The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns into the heavy morning traffic.
S: INT. MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis. The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun. A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off. NEW ANGLE The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged Scandinavian GOVERNESS.
C: SAM
D: I can't stand it -- half an hour to get to the stupid school every morning... with no music... [Just our damn Nanny...]
E: Korean; subtitled
S: EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
N: Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
N: Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows. The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.
S: INT. MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence. The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
N: The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a switch on his radio-control unit... CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately, scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT... WIDER Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction PILE-UP you can imagine. Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still coming onto the overpass. Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy, glass shatters. And then it gets really nasty... A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant. It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail... Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans. They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.
S: INT. MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.
C: DRIVER
D: [Stay in the car.]
E: Korean
S: EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
N: A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.
S: INT./EXT. JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY
N: Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it. ANGLE WITH JAVAL as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and rolls under the Mercedes. The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it, then rolls back toward the van.
S: INT. MERCEDES - DAY
N: Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
N: Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks another radio unit. Working.
S: EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
N: The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by, Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the Mercedes onto the 405 south.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit. Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it... But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway. INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES Javal's device is armed, and waiting...
T: FADE TO:
S: EXT. SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single- family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards. Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the signs, they've been there for quite a while.
S: INT. CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly. PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly. Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight, muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well. Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes above all else that one should never raise one's voice. Carson groans... he's DREAMING...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY
N: Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape. Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank. Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck. Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.
C: CARSON
D: Son of a bitch!
N: He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...
C: MIRANDA
D: Pete... please... we have to be up early tomorrow. Call the police.
C: CARSON
D: Yeah, right.
N: He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad, its LCD reading "ARMED." He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand. Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.
C: CARSON
D: Shit!
E: continuing
N: MIRANDA pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.
C: MIRANDA
D: Not again...
S: EXT. CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by the streetlight -- Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop. Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying the ignition switch out of the dashboard. Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a crowbar. His partner keeps working. NEW ANGLE Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice. Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS. Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS. As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out. Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over. Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm breaks, and Carson tosses him aside. Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet. WIDER Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street -- And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned. Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it. Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble with their sidearms.
C: WESTEC GUARD
D: Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On the ground!
N: Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.
C: CARSON
D: Asshole was trying to boost my car!
N: ANGLE ACROSS STREET Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.
C: CARSON
D: Mike -- call 911!
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Been trying... It's busy. He's the good guy, you schumcks.
E: has a cordless phone to Guards; re Carson
N: The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time. CLOSER Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray- painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do? The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right under the gushing SPRINKLER.
C: CARSON
D: I hate this fuckin' town.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY
N: Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.
C: JOY
D: There are six bathrooms in this house, Sam.
C: SAM
D: But only one with a smoking section.
E: fanning the air
N: She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish. Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs. He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit. Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders. Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the "Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: [Go change.]
E: Korean
N: Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: [You smell like a fireplace.]
E: continuing
N: A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.
C: MRS. HAN
D: It's the Governess... Hello, Hilda...
E: into phone
T: CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS
N: as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous. We cannot see her surroundings.

E: thru phone
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
C: MRS. HAN
D: We will see you next week... It appears I'll be taking you to school.
E: into phone hangs up; smiles to kids
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
N: In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.
C: JAVAL
D: Very good. You may go now...
N: He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors. Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess' upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest. He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.
S: INT. CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY
N: Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV. ANGLE ON TV A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to us from a local NEWS COPTER.
C: BOBBI
D: ...Good morning, Summit Day! It's gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of July, the Olympics and Woodstock all rolled into one! All over town there'll be parades, concerts, rallies, festivals... So get out there everyone, but plan your drive- time accordingly! This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...
E: on TV
N: We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about to board a helicopter.
C: MORNING ANCHOR
D: The President is on his way...
E: VO on TV
C: PRESIDENT
D: ...It's an honor hosting my fellow leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol city of the Pacific Rim...

C: MORNING ANCHOR
D: We'll see the menu for Mayor Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right after this...
E: on TV
N: We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events around town. BACK TO SCENE As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.
C: MIRANDA
D: I was watching that.
C: CARSON
D: If I hear one more Beach Boys song, I'll shoot myself.
N: Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.
C: CARSON
D: I said, if we were having sex once in a while, you wouldn't need to ride that fucking bike every morning.
E: continuing; while smiling
C: MIRANDA
D: Be right with you...
E: hasn't heard a thing
N: As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them. Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington; Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."
S: INT./EXT. CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY
N: Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes, is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter. Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."
C: MIRANDA
D: Have you gotten any sleep lately?
E: looks him over
C: CARSON
D: Shop's gonna tow the car in -- goddamn ignition's trashed.
E: ignores the question
C: MIRANDA
D: Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.
N: Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the rose bushes.
C: CARSON
D: You ask me, those suckers are a lost cause.
N: She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.
C: MIRANDA
D: It's not for you.
C: CARSON
D: You mean it's not for you.
C: MIRANDA
D: I don't chase car thieves in my underwear. C'mon, you'd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved.
C: CARSON
D: I'd die of shock, from finding anyone dumb enough to buy the place. Even for what it's worth now.
C: MIRANDA
D: Lots of people bought at the top of the market...
C: CARSON
D: That sure cheers me right up.
C: MIRANDA
D: I don't know why we even talk about it. The city's not the problem. So we move. It wouldn't matter. What's that saying: "Wherever you go, there you are."
N: Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces from the cut in his side.
C: MIRANDA
D: I hope you're current on your tetanus booster. Was it worth it?
E: continuing
C: CARSON
D: One cut... two assholes in the hospital... Yep.
N: Carson glances at his watch and gets up.
C: CARSON
D: Well, another day of baby-sitting my favorite bunch of people...
E: continuing
N: He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229, 9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker. Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.
C: MIRANDA
D: Ask for a transfer.
C: CARSON
D: They're not gonna transfer me. You know damn well why I was bumped down to guard duty... My outstanding people skills.
E: as he's leaving
N: Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she sadly watches him go.
S: EXT. CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY
N: A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus. He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street. He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket. The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.
C: CARSON
D: I hate this fuckin' town.
N: Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960. As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside. Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt SWEARING:
C: ANGRY VOICE
D: Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a shit...
E: OS
N: THEIR POV In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible. The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in the car with her schoolbooks in her lap. JOY turns to Mrs. Han:
C: JOY
D: Can we give Lisa a ride?
S: INT./EXT. MERCEDES - DAY
N: It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.
C: LISA
D: Hey, Joy... Sam...
N: Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.
C: LISA
D: Excellent -- I can't hear him!
E: continuing
C: SAM
D: The glass is an inch thick. Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb- proof.
E: raps on window points to doors, roof
C: LISA
D: Perfect car for L.A. Starts, too.
E: looks back at her Dad
S: EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
N: As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's van begins following it. INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate. DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket. He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE, (45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the outside world, with profound contempt. Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far corner of the property, just outside the high fence.
S: INT. FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee. Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female). They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.
C: ROBBINS
D: Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually escaped the office!
C: DAVE
D: I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em a chance to hose out my cage.
N: He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.
C: DAVE
D: Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?
E: continuing
C: ROBBINS
D: Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.
N: Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.
C: SABATINI
D: "Chuckles," as we're inclined to call him. Friggin' graveyard shift...
E: yawns; flops in a chair
C: ROBBINS
D: Love to know what dope made it the Bureau's job to give full-time protection to foreign consulates. Cup a mud?
E: offers coffee to Dave
C: DAVE
D: Not if you made it. Why don't you get Sabatini to brew the java? She's the alleged chick.
C: SABATINI
D: Blow me.
C: DAVE
D: Where's Carson?
C: SABATINI
D: On his way. Some creeps tried to rip off his Mustang last night. They cut the ragtop.
E: beat; solemnly
C: DAVE
D: Motherfuckers...
N: Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.
C: DAVE
D: Latest and greatest. Wireless network link-ups.
E: continuing
C: SABATINI
D: Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.
C: ROBBINS
D: Me, too.
C: DAVE
D: Ingrates.
S: EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
N: The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.
S: EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
N: As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes. Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a bag of oranges walks from car to car. Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.
S: INT. MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY
N: The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver glances in the rear-view: There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS. The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts. They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar. Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - SAME
N: Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote. INSERT Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.
S: INT. MERCEDES - DAY
N: The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.
S: EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
N: The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car. Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun. He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium. The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of BURNING magnesium shrapnel. WIDER The other drivers in the intersection see this and go completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards. Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic. The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car. Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs. Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away. Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down. He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it. He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over his dashboard to get a look at the action. Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the entire front of his car burst into FLAMES. Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.
C: JAVAL
D: You see that I'm serious in my intention, yes? If you cooperate, you and your children will be home for dinner tonight.
E: she nods
N: He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
N: He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs. Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other handcuff to Lisa. Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.
S: EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
N: Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground. His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out. ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.
S: INT. FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate. Dave follows.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.
C: COLONEL LEE
D: [You must stay here.]
E: Korean; to Ambassador Han
N: Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: Someone took my family!
N: The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.
C: SABATINI
D: You got no jurisdiction outside this property!
N: Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: My men are going!
N: Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost running Sabatini over.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: It's a white telephone van, driving west on Washington Boulevard.
E: continuing; to Sabatini
N: The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government Dodge is blocking theirs.
C: ROBBINS
D: Keys!
N: Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.
C: SABATINI
D: You're ridin' shotgun.
S: INT. DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.
C: ROBBINS
D: Cherry?
C: DAVE
D: Under the seat.
N: Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.
C: ROBBINS
D: Siren?
C: DAVE
D: I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin' hurry..!
S: EXT. FREMONT PLACE - DAY
N: Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate, Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.
S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He fishtails, making a U-turn. He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them. All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way. He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:
C: SABATINI
D: Someone snatched Han's family! White phone van, westbound on Washington!
N: Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.
C: CARSON
D: Give me a secure radio!
N: Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of- shit Dodge, trying to keep up.
S: EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY
N: Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good- looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by virtue of his quiet competence. A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.
C: CO-WORKER
D: Someone's been to Nordstroms, big time.
C: WALTHER
D: Clothes make the man.
C: CO-WORKER
D: But does the man make enough for the clothes?
C: WALTHER
D: The man makes payments on his Visa.
E: smiles
N: Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.
C: SECRETARY
D: Mr. Walther... priority line!
C: WALTHER
D: This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl Walther... What's the nature of your emer -- Aw, Jesus... not today... I'll inform channels and get a copter in the air. For God's sake, keep it quiet. Do what you can, but don't endanger civilians or the family!

S: INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

E: into radio
C: SABATINI
D: Think it's them?

C: SABATINI
D: Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!
S: EXT. WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
N: Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic. HIS POV As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government- issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo. JAVAL grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.
S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under the plastic tarp it's wrapped in. Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it. Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a deafening round through the roof of the van.
C: JAVAL
D: I need to concentrate!
S: EXT. WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
N: During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket... Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a vial of crack. NEW ANGLE The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.
S: EXT. LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY
N: Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a one-block lead on Carson and the others. Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up. Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the same direction as Javal is driving. Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and then quickly backs up into the garage.
S: INT. ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
N: As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap- buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed. Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED. Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly- constructed remotes:
S: INT. DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
N: Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid. A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine; Engage the transmission; And supply fuel to the carburetor.
S: EXT. ALLEYWAYS
N: The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal. The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and the rear walls of buildings...
S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
C: CARSON
D: He's gonna wrap it around something!
E: into radio
S: EXT. ALLEYWAYS - DAY
N: Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley. Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.
C: CARSON
D: Oh, shit...
E: OS
N: The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES. NEW ANGLE Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van. Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick. Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.
C: COLONEL LEE
D: You should not have interfered!
N: Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.
C: CARSON
D: I'm in no mood...
N: Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.
C: ROBBINS
D: Forget about him!
N: By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and whites and helicopters converge on the area.
S: EXT. ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY
N: A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming from a loudspeaker. Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.
S: EXT. ALLEYWAYS - DAY
N: The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So, accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities. Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

N: Off their perplexed looks, we
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
N: One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry. In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs, side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV. The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to the moon... and it terrifies her.
C: JAVAL
D: Does anyone need to use the rest room? This will be your last opportunity for a few hours. Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy, please sit here. And you... what is your name?
E: no takers indicates the Lazy Boys; then turns to Lisa
C: LISA
D: Lisa...
E: after a beat
N: Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:
C: JAVAL
D: No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.
N: He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.
C: JAVAL
D: You afford me some additional bargaining power. But not much.
E: continuing; sotto
N: She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator. He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth. He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it. We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a green light and the meters come to life.
C: JAVAL
D: There. No taping your mouths, no restraints. Please remain still while I explain. The meters on the left indicate sound pressure -- Decibels. There are microphones on your chair backs. If you raise your voices above certain level, putting your meter in the red zone for more than one sustained second, the circuit will be closed. The right meters indicate motion. There are pressure sensors inside the armrests and seats. The sensors don't like to get wet, so I hope you were honest about not needing to use the loo. If you make any excess movements, or try to leave your chair, the circuit will be closed.
E: continuing beat
C: MRS. HAN
D: I don't understand...
N: She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.
C: MRS. HAN
D: What happens if the circuit closes?
E: continuing; softly
C: JAVAL
D: Kaboom...
N: He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.
C: JAVAL
D: Easy... deep breath... Do each of you understand?
E: continuing to the kids
N: They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.
C: JAVAL
D: Keep your wits, and all will be fine.
E: continuing
N: He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere. COMMENTATOR #1 (on TV) ...Not since the '84 Olympics has the whole city had an such an opportunity -- Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.
S: INT. GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.
C: WALTHER
D: Carson? Walther. Who told the Ambassador?
E: Carson nods
C: CARSON
D: His Security Chief. There was a civilian with them -- fifteen-year-old girl from across the street. We're trying to reach the parents.

S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer. Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins, Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.
C: CARSON
D: I'm not so sure what happened here. Something smells. Asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him...
C: WALTHER
D: What the hell are you talking about?
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: Mr. Walther?
E: OS
N: Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with repressed emotion.
C: WALTHER
D: Ambassador Han... my deepest --
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: -- I have no wish for condolences. Just answers.
C: WALTHER
D: As soon as we have any to give...
N: Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands. Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp breath and sits on the steps.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: Yoon..?!
E: into phone
C: CARSON
D: Start a trace!
E: to FBI agents
N: Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

C: MRS. HAN
D: We are not hurt. But this man is very serious --
E: into phone

N: Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: There is a television in my office.
N: As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:
C: ROBBINS
D: We're screwed on the trace -- he's on a cell phone.
E: VO thru radio
S: INT. FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

S: INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
N: Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture. CLOSER There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera. CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.
C: CARSON
D: Oh, Jesus, those're explosives! Look at the TV -- this was just taken.
E: OS beat
N: BACK TO SCENE A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does, the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han picks up the phone on his desk.
C: JAVAL
D: There must surely be several people in the room; you may put me on the speakerbox if you wish.
E: VO thru phone
N: Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.
C: JAVAL
D: I am not a terrorist. Your countries' political posturing means nothing to me. So do not waste time trying to negotiate. The Federal Reserve Bank of Los Angeles can furnish ten million dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The required denominations are in the instructions, as is the method of packaging. Be in your car at 3:00 PM, and drive north on Highland Avenue. I will call with where to leave the money, which you will do at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will call again at 4:00 with the family's location and the method for removing them from their... predicament. Could you please refer to page one? Any deviation from these instructions and my device will fulfill its function at exactly 5:00 PM.
E: VO continuing; thru speakerbox beat they look at the photo
N: CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless. Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

C: WALTHER
D: Of course. The FBI's top Hostage Negotiator is on the way --
C: CARSON
D: -- Goddamn Negotiator's the last thing we need! This asshole sound like he was interested in bargaining?
N: Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:
C: WALTHER
D: We have people who are experts in these situations. We really feel it would be best if you let them coordinate everything...
N: Numb, Ambassador Han nods.
C: WALTHER
D: Let's get on it...
E: continuing; to Carson
S: INT. FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.
C: CARSON
D: ...You're gonna just pay up, count on his good nature to return the family?!
C: WALTHER
D: It's the President's intention to keep this quiet, move forward with the Summit, and work with the North Koreans. Jesus, you've already embarrassed the shit out of us over the phone surveillance --
C: CARSON
D: -- They know their phones are tapped! They tap our fucking phones!
C: WALTHER
D: That's not the point! The point is not acknowledging it! We got an international incident brewing, with a country we were practically at war with last year! Our best Negotiator is gonna run point. If you got a problem, you can take the goddamn rest of the day off.

C: CARSON
D: This Consulate is my responsibility.

D: Not any more.
N: Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.

N: Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him. Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)
C: CARSON
D: ...Our worst enemy'll be the city. There are events gearing up all around town, and a dozen world leaders arriving. Add the Friday rush hour and usual L.A. bad behavior and it'll be a nightmare out there by 3 PM. It all works to the advantage of the kidnapper, hinders our pursuit efforts... You don't agree?
E: frowns
N: WIDER The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson. It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over the breast pocket of her jacket.
C: MIRANDA
D: I'm wondering whether to believe him when he says he's strictly motivated by money.
C: CARSON
D: You see one word of Peoples'- Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about- this-week bullshit in this entire letter?
E: grabs faxes back
C: MIRANDA
D: I still want to check the MO against known politicals, terrorists --
C: CARSON
D: -- Already doing it. We're coordinating with the Secret Service, the NSA and the CIA.
C: MIRANDA
D: Have someone talk to the LAPD, give them a cover story for the media about the crash on La Cienega.
N: Walther comes in and looks at Carson.
C: WALTHER
D: Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll is your wife?!
N: This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.
C: CARSON
D: If she'd changed her name when we got married, I wouldn't have to.
E: while looking at Miranda
C: MIRANDA
D: I'm so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together...
E: to Carson
C: WALTHER
D: Jesus, forget I asked. The cash will be here in an hour. Any thoughts on the kidnapper's thoughts?
E: beat to Miranda
C: MIRANDA
D: Everything indicates he's working alone. And his concerns do seem to be solely about the money... so I agree that he's only using the Summit and the tension with North Korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom.
C: COLONEL LEE
D: I will bring the money to him.
C: CARSON
D: My ass.
C: COLONEL LEE
D: The hostages are citizens of the People's Republic of Korea --
C: CARSON
D: -- Hey, do I go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job?
C: WALTHER
D: All right, you're outta here! Is this the same insubordinate crap you pulled at Beverly Thrift?
N: Carson glares coldly at Walther.
C: CARSON
D: I'll coordinate the drop.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: Perhaps that is better. Inspector Carson knows the terrain --
C: COLONEL LEE
D: -- Then he can come with me.
N: Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.
C: WALTHER
D: It's settled.
E: firm; to Carson
C: CARSON
D: It sucks.

N: Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on. Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.
C: JAVAL
D: That's more like it...
N: He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills. He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves. EXT. PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea. Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling, gray, stifling, hopeless.
S: INT. WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY
N: In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly- decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS. Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA sits up front and listens passively. An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out the door.
S: EXT. WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY
N: Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.
C: OPERATIVE
D: ...They've got the Premier agreeing to the hard-line position --
E: into uplink device
N: He hears footsteps approaching (OS).
C: OPERATIVE
D: More to follow...
E: continuing; sotto
N: He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING... After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just before a GUARD rounds the corner.
S: EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
N: "Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere. WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.
S: INT. FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

C: DAVE
D: I wanted to be home by now, take the kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.
C: SABATINI
D: We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now, L.A. was supposed to be a brown blotch in the rear-view mirror.
N: She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags into two larger bags. Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife. He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.
C: MIRANDA
D: He'll expect a homing device --
C: CARSON
D: -- I expect him to expect it. He'll check the cash with an RF detector... Meaning he'll find this one. This only has a quarter-mile range, but on a frequency too low to detect. And I doubt the asshole will have an X-ray machine or a metal detector.
E: re larger transmitter re smaller transmitter turns off receiver
C: MIRANDA
D: Why must you always refer generically to criminals as "assholes?"
C: CARSON
D: Gosh, you're right. It could undermine their self-esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation.
C: MIRANDA
D: You been reading my magazines in the bathroom again?
N: She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:
C: JAVAL
D: "And my device will fulfill its function at exactly 5:00 PM..."
E: VO thru recorder
C: MIRANDA
D: He's really exhibiting pressured speech... big effort here to sound calm. Same with his vocabulary... if he were in control, he wouldn't feel such a need to sound that way.
C: CARSON
D: Just tell me if we can use it.
C: MIRANDA
D: If we needle him he could get sloppy and give us an opening, but I'm not going to risk it. This is the worst kind of perpetrator: anything makes him deviate from his carefully- scripted plan, he could become extremely volatile.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
N: During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor, pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

S: EXT. WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY INT. WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup. The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.
C: PRESIDENT
D: What the hell is the big crisis?
E: thru video link
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: We just received a missive from the North Korean attachÈ. They say the kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke and humiliate them during the Summit.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Bullshit. They're just ticked because we don't want the Chinese dragging their asses into the treaty talks.
E: thru video link
N: The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.
C: INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
D: We have a covert operative in place. He reports the hard-liners and moderates in the High Command are arguing about how to respond, should the Premier's niece and her children should be killed.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Respond?! Christ. What about the damn Premier?
E: scowls; thru video link
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: He's weak. He has to look tough to save face, keep control of hard- liners... otherwise he risks a coup.
C: CIA CHIEF
D: Which is a real possibility. Most of those old-fart Generals don't want to -more-
N: CIA CHIEF (Cont'd) be part of the Summit any more than we want them to. They're mad as hell he even talked to the Chinese.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I don't want to deal with this right now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell the North we'll pay the ransom for 'em... Placate 'em! And make damn sure we get that family back in one piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?
E: thru video link
C: FBI CHIEF
D: The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack team in place.
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: There's a Diplomatic Liaison from State, too.
C: CIA CHIEF
D: What about your man stationed at the Consulate... Carson? He was demoted from the FBI Hostage Program, couple years back. And this did happen on his watch...
E: to FBI Chief refers to notes
C: FBI CHIEF
D: There's no way he could've prevented this abduction! Besides, I've got one of my top Negotiators in charge --
E: irritated

E: thru video link
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES. Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side. Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is completely in the car.
S: EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
N: The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town is all done up with posters and banners. Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

C: CARSON
D: Must've bought a house same time we did.
E: to himself
S: EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
N: Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland near Hollywood Blvd. Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc. A BIKER CLUB of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn from the Boulevard onto Highland.
S: EXT. DEMILLE BARN - DAY
N: Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."
S: INT./EXT. JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
N: Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a Summit-related concert is being readied. Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.
S: INT. MERCEDES - DAY
N: Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the pavement. Carson looks around.
C: CARSON
D: There's about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here... So spread out.
E: into radio
N: Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.
S: INT. DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel, smacks his arm and points ahead:
S: EXT. DEMILLE BARN - DAY
N: Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above the bags of money.
C: DAVE
D: Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream truck!
E: into radio
S: EXT. ODIN STREET - DAY
N: Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.
S: INT. JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
N: Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.
S: INT. DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY
N: The van pulls away. Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving. He looks up... Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.
C: DAVE
D: Son of a bitch! He found the bleepers -- both of them!
E: into radio
S: INT. MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

E: into radio
C: DAVE
D: Toward the freeway.
E: VO thru radio
N: Carson hangs a U-turn.
S: EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
N: At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101, Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp. Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it. Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave. Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes. The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off... blocking Sabatini's way. Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101 North on-ramp.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while anxiously clutching her two-way radio.
C: MIRANDA

E: beat; into radio
S: INT. MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his AMD-74 machine gun.
C: CARSON
D: Watch it! We need him alive!
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
N: Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out. The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping against the cars around it. Carson pulls up closer... Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open... And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the back of the machine. He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a maniac back the way he came. Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving away from him.
C: COLONEL LEE
D: Turn around!
N: But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy traffic, until he spots what he was looking for: The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead. Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars, wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:
C: CARSON
D: FBI. Call our office, they'll take care of you.
N: Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend. They pull guns, knives, chains... They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5 machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:
C: BIKER
D: I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn dentist!
N: COLONEL LEE gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around. JAVAL continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes, driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland, leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake. WIDER When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.
S: EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
N: Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets into the southbound lanes. He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.
C: CARSON
D: Just don't kill yourself, you piece of shit...
N: Carson fishes out his two-way.
C: CARSON
D: Helicopter or two would be nice!
E: continuing; into radio
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.
C: MIRANDA
D: Love to be in the loop on this...
E: into radio
S: EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
N: Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.
C: CARSON
D: Not just now, dear...
E: to himself
N: Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson. Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art- deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.
C: CARSON
D: I coulda had a ranch... maybe some horses... but no, we moved to L.A.
E: continuing; grumbling
N: JAVAL speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun. A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him. Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.
S: EXT. ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
N: Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter. Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs. NEW ANGLE Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique, outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story concrete tower. He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate. Javal comes back out, panicking. He HEARS Carson coming up the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose. ANGLE WITH CARSON as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle, abandoned, lying on its side... And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead. Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside. HIS POV The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is hanging through the broken window. Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.
C: CARSON
D: He's on foot, at the base of the elevator tower!
E: into radio
N: But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...
S: EXT. HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY
N: Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.
S: EXT. ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
N: Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.
C: CARSON
D: Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!
E: into radio
S: EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
N: In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin. Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane. On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as they all try to catch up to Javal. The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill below Franklin.
S: EXT. VINE STREET - DAY
N: Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset. Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo. Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill. It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level. Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta. Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo. Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!
S: INT. PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.
S: EXT. VINE STREET - DAY
N: Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way. It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo. Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself against the inside of the Geo's roof. Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.
S: INT. PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere. The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...
S: EXT. VINE STREET - DAY
N: The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it. The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the bottom of the hill.
S: INT. JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.
S: EXT. SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY
N: The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12 floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like backwash. The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner. CLOSER From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear the copter is not going to stay where it is for long. The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the steering wheel to keep from falling out. ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse... anything to get away from the area below the impact. JAVAL reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the seat start to slide toward the open door. He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS again... he loses his grip... And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car. We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING... Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.
S: EXT. VINE AND SUNSET - DAY
N: Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering copter and Geo are right above it. Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work... Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets. All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle. Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose... Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body. With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away from the building. Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the street, diving for cover behind a car. BEHIND CARSON the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE. NEW ANGLE Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others. He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.
C: CARSON
D: Fingerprint it. He's not gonna tell us where to find the hostages... -more-
E: to Walther
N: CARSON (Cont'd) (looks at watch) Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to figure it out for ourselves.
C: WALTHER
D: Figure it out?! With what?!
C: CARSON
D: Miranda! We need a copter, pronto! Get back to his van. There were no plates, but check the VIN, look it over, then meet us at the Consulate.
E: ignores him; into radio to Robbins
N: Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.
C: CARSON
D: Go!
E: continuing
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini, Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.
C: CARSON
D: ...Scrounge us some bodies: National Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local PD's, meter maids --
E: to Walther
C: WALTHER
D: -- They're gonna search the whole city in a goddamn hour..?!
C: CARSON
D: Look, I don't need you to tell me how fucked we are!
C: WALTHER
D: Fuck you!! Every time you're on a case something explodes!
N: Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:
C: MIRANDA
D: Stop! The clock's running! Arguing is a luxury we can't afford! -more-
N: MIRANDA (Cont'd) (looks at Carson) What's done is done. There'll be plenty of time to point fingers later. Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.
C: SABATINI
D: I need some fuckin' ink!!
N: Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her. In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: This is impossible! How can you even begin to find them?
N: Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.
C: MIRANDA
D: Well, the normal procedure is to negotiate with the perpetrator...
N: Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.
C: CARSON
D: Let's take stock. We've got a picture of where he hid the family, and recordings of his calls --
C: MIRANDA
D: -- That's right! We can send them to our experts for analysis...
C: CARSON
D: Same with his fingerprints. But that means we need high-quality image and data transmission. We can piss away ten minutes coptering this shit to our offices in Westwood, or we can use your surveillance equipment.
E: to Ambassador Han
C: COLONEL LEE
D: There is no surveillance equipment. This is a diplomatic facility --
C: CARSON
D: -- You want to play games, fine.
N: He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: Take them upstairs.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
N: In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc. Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
T: hardly cutting-edge technology.
N: Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow. Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.
C: CARSON
D: South Korean Consulate's just down the street -- want to take a listen?
N: Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him. Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.
C: CARSON
D: Shitcan that thing, will you?!
E: continuing; re hand
N: She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a wastepaper basket.
C: CARSON
D: Got a digital scanner?
E: continuing; to Colonel Lee
C: COLONEL LEE
D: Analog.
C: CARSON
D: You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade. Dave -- get in here. Bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls.
E: looks equipment over into radio
C: DAVE
D: On my way...
E: VO thru radio
N: He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.
C: MIRANDA
D: Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe him to the Ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows.
E: to Colonel Lee
N: Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.
C: CARSON
D: This is Carson in L.A. There's a set of prints coming over. Narrow the search criteria: Male, thirties, Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss, maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and bombers first. We need an answer in fifteen minutes.

D: We got one of the best sound guys right here in town... Newman in Audio Analysis...
E: to Walther into phone
C: DAVE
D: Newman's gone.
E: OS
N: WIDER Dave comes into the room.
C: DAVE
D: He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a bed and breakfast in Wyoming.
N: Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.
C: DAVE
D: Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like to see the fight tonight.
E: continuing; looks around
C: CARSON
D: Get those tapes transferred to a sound guy. We need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada.
C: DAVE
D: Enchilada -- you saying that because I'm Mexican?
C: CARSON
D: No... 'cause you're fat.
C: MIRANDA
D: Photo enhancement... Isn't there some amazing tech with the LAPD --
E: picks up Javal's fax
C: DAVE
D: -- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle PD a month ago.
C: CARSON
D: Jesus H. Christ...
C: SABATINI
D: I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA earn their keep.
C: CARSON
D: Do it.
N: Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the dust on her fingertip.
C: MIRANDA
D: Given his behavior, this orange residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg. Amphetamines.
C: CARSON
D: Any significance?
C: MIRANDA
D: It's consistent with the lone wolf scenario: A handful of these is pure bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in. We could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally... if we had a couple of weeks, that is.
E: beat
C: CARSON
D: Get the Bureau on it.
E: to Sabatini
C: MIRANDA
D: Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.
C: CARSON
D: Look, goddammit, you start skipping no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now.
N: Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.
C: CARSON
D: He grabbed the family at 8:30. The last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the Consulate at 9:30.
E: continuing
C: MIRANDA
D: That gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb.
C: CARSON
D: He probably waited a while to pad the time -- he wanted us know the family was still alive... ...So these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either. I say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them.
E: sotto; re Koreans
N: He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown, Hollywood to Inglewood.
C: MIRANDA
D: The most densely-populated part of the L.A. basin. This narrows it down to about 200,000 dwellings.
N: A beat while this sinks in.
C: MIRANDA
D: He was traveling west --
E: continuing
C: CARSON
D: -- Bet he doubled back.
C: MIRANDA
D: C'mon, that's total conjecture --
C: SABATINI
D: -- I'd trust his instincts when dealing with maniacs. He is deeply disturbed.
E: re Carson
C: MIRANDA
D: You're telling me?
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup, is pacing on Air Force One.
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: ...North Koreans have gone ballistic, accusing us of botching the ransom drop on purpose.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: They're still harping on that "American plot" nonsense.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Meaning?
E: thru video link
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: They say the death of the Premier's niece and her family would justify immediate retaliation.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Are they out of their fuckin' minds?! What kind of retaliation?
E: thru video link
N: Everyone in the room looks at one another.
C: CIA CHIEF
D: They're threatening to pull a Saddam Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed at Jerusalem during Desert Storm? They're talking about firing a missile into Los Angeles --
E: beat
C: PRESIDENT
D: -- A goddamn WHAT??
E: thru video link
C: INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
D: Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range cruise -- their version of our Tomahawk, launched from offshore.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will find the city, but it's not too accurate beyond that.
C: VICE PRESIDENT
D: Still, for their purposes it's perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take out a city block or two...
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: To the eyes of the world it's a measured response -- like what Reagan did to Qaddafi. But actually striking at an American city would be a huge psychological victory for them.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I don't believe I'm hearing this! So if we know it's coming, we can knock it out of the fuckin' sky!
E: thru video link beat
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: These weapons fly subsonically, below radar... we don't have the defenses in place... If we'd had the time to deploy a string of Patriot anti- missile batteries across the coast --
C: PRESIDENT
D: -- You're saying we got all this lousy hardware and can't stop one goddamn missile??
E: thru video link

N: The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:
C: INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
D: The North Korean Premier holds what we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's able to destroy a missile in flight, right up to the moment before it achieves its target.
C: CIA CHIEF
D: Our Op says they've timed their retaliation to hit right after 5:00.
C: FBI CHIEF
D: And if the family turns up okay, they'll just make it self-destruct.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Shit! I really don't need this today!
E: thru video link
C: VICE PRESIDENT
D: We're forgetting one thing here: the family. Intelligence is sure the North will abort their attack if Mrs. Han and her kids are safely returned?
C: CIA CHIEF
D: Absolutely. Their whole game depends on claiming a legitimate provocation.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Still, we should let them know there'd be a response... if it comes to it.
C: PRESIDENT
D: I'd like to turn 'em into a radioactive parking lot.
E: thru video link
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: That's the problem: we can't. We're the last superpower. Our hands are tied by politics, alliances, goddamn stacks of treaties... most we could do is give 'em a "measured response" back again, or everyone starts crying that we're the bullies.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a stunt like this.
C: PRESIDENT
D: Believe me, the North drops one in my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in theirs. Get some bombers in the air. And don't tell me any more bad news!

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun. The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently. NEW ANGLE Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist, lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not. Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks it up, then turns away in horror. A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag with a spent shotgun shell in it.
C: YOUNG COP

He calmly SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE. The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts. Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile. Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile. Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

S: INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
N: The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...
C: JOY
D: Oh, my God...
N: The meters are hovering just below the red... SAM pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest. He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing... He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with a small piece of the gum. And his meter drops to zero. WIDER Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other... He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it. Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash... Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half, and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy. Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO... All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light stops flashing. Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

D: So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?
E: thru video link
C: INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
D: Uh, it's a code name... for weapons using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...
N: He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President about this.
C: INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
D: Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347 they attacked a Genoese fort, and catapulted infected corpses over the walls. The Genoese who survived carried the disease back to Europe... and it killed half the population.
E: continuing
C: PRESIDENT
D: Get to the goddamn point, Major.
E: thru video link
N: The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.
C: CIA CHIEF
D: Seems the missile is armed with a warhead carrying the Pneumonic Plague.
N: The President goes nuts.
C: PRESIDENT
D: The Black Plague?! Every time I talk to you fuckin' guys it gets worse! What happened to this "limited retaliation" shit?
E: thru video link
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: The North Koreans insist the missile carries a conventional payload. They say we're trying to trick them into aborting the attack.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Especially since the uplink from our Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.
C: CIA CHIEF
D: We think one of the Hard-liners switched the warhead without the Premier's knowledge. But he's not about to take our word for it, and he's too weak to risk the humiliation of backing down.
C: PRESIDENT
D: They use a biological weapon on American soil, they have to know we'll respond!
E: incredulous; thru video link
C: SECRETARY OF STATE
D: Maybe they don't think we got the guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause they think they can whip us, like what happened in 'Nam. Look who we're dealing with: a teetering, outlaw regime, and inside it, some wild-ass renegades working their screwy agenda!
C: PRESIDENT
D: What the hell are we doing in L.A.?
E: thru video link

D: We've deployed Marines from Pendleton and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft. Irwin, put 'em in protective suits, but it's 40 minutes before they're on the ground.
C: PRESIDENT
D: All right. Assuming the worst... What'll happen?
E: thru video link
N: The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his COMPUTER GRAPHICS.
C: INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
D: The warhead vents the plague bacteria above the target area, infecting about 50,000 people. First symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes become swollen; temperature rises to 105. Victims turn deep purple from lung hemorrhaging, usually die the same day. There are treatments -- streptomycin and tetracyclines -- but we'd be overwhelmed by the numbers and its extreme contagiousness.
E: beat
C: CIA CHIEF
D: We could have 500,000 infected in a week, who knows how many after that.
N: Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

D: I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have the Summit leaders been warned?
E: thru video link

D: Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A. 'til we give the all-clear.

D: And you're sure it's safe if we can get 'em to destroy the missile in flight?
E: thru video link
C: INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
D: The bacteria can't survive the heat of an explosion.
C: CIA CHIEF
D: I suggest none of this go any further -- not even to the agents working to find the family. Word leaks out to a city of 12 million people there's rocket full of the Plague coming at 'em, you'll create a panic of biblical proportions.

N: People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food, wine and beer... and crank up the Beach Boys TUNES. Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high rises -- Century City, Westwood, downtown, etc.
S: EXT. U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
N: A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa. Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts. They begin to TAKE OFF...
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY
N: The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic. Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners -- until he finds the reason for the jam-up: Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans. He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.
C: CARSON
D: We're hoofing it.
N: Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.
C: SABATINI
D: 'She's got the field experience'... To park the fuckin' car!
E: pissed
S: EXT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
N: A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
N: Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel Lee rush into the lobby. Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d, but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is ajar... He pushes it open... And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles. Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.
C: CARSON
D: Whoa... FBI..!
E: pulls out his i.d.
N: They lower their weapons.
C: CARSON
D: How the hell you get here so fast?
E: continuing

S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
N: The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10" on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out. Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing. He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly unlocks the door.
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
N: The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark. As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN. The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.
C: WOMAN
D: What the fuck..!
N: Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and shows them her FBI shield.
C: MIRANDA
D: Sorry...
N: Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot- wide, ornamental balcony.
C: CARSON
D: Wait here.
E: to Miranda
N: She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.
S: EXT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
N: The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the curtains into the window of Javal's apartment. He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty... the balcony SLIPS a little... He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline. Carson cautiously goes into the living room -- It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes, and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.
C: CARSON
D: I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight while I look around.
E: into radio
N: Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
N: The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.
C: MIRANDA
D: I like what you've done with the place...
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
N: The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand. SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.
C: COLONEL LEE
D: Wait!
N: Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.
C: SABATINI
D: Where's Carson?
C: COLONEL LEE
D: Inside.
N: Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty. He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open... He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a piece was cut, then neatly replaced. Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining NOISE coming from the kitchen. He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty. Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe. Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants: two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic. We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.
C: CARSON
D: NO! --
N: Too late... The front door opens.... Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door... As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room. Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
N: Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall. Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)
S: INT. MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
N: SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda. Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around... And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.
C: CARSON
D: I said keep everyone back!!
N: He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.
C: MIRANDA
D: Stop it!
N: Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.
C: CARSON
D: Get out of my sight.
E: to Colonel Lee
N: He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.
S: INT. NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

E: long beat
C: MIRANDA
D: The Bureau never would've let you. They want it by the book: talk them out.
N: Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT./EXT. BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY
N: Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to: A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball. The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges. Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed to protect themselves... The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES. Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
C: CARSON
D: Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.
C: MIRANDA

N: The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY
N: Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders, construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc. A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads: This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
N: The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther, then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.
C: CARSON
D: C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank records? What about cross-referencing possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!
N: Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off. Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:
C: MIRANDA
D: Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry! Where are the numbers for the outdoor ad companies?
E: reaches for phone
C: ROBBINS
D: Parker Center's making those calls.
S: INT. NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:
C: BOBBI
D: Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!
C: CAMERAMAN
D: Maybe it's true... probably is true. That's why they got a news blackout!
C: BOBBI
D: I'll rip your miserable eyeballs out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!
N: He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.
S: INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY
N: The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...
C: BOBBI
D: ...A warning was radioed to U.S. Intelligence that a biological weapon, allegedly containing the deadly Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los Angeles. While unconfirmed, the President and other leaders are all late in arriving...
E: on TV
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
N: The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report. Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a long column of telephone numbers.
C: DAVE
D: Finally got the call list from Javal's phone. Most aren't his; they're from the legit user who didn't know his number was cloned.
C: CARSON
D: Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours.
N: Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.
C: DAVE
D: Here's the call to the Consulate -- 965-5000. The rest are dupes... all from the other guy...
E: while scrolling
C: CARSON
D: Wait... go back... the one at seven this morning...
N: Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666. WIDER Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk. (FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button. (FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666." BACK TO SCENE Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently. Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact. Time stands still. Realization. Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster. Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.
C: CARSON
D: Get down!
N: Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door. The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console. Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor, while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction. Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first. Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder. Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.
C: CARSON
D: MIRANDA!
E: continuing
N: Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door. Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda. Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them. Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY. Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open. She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is mushroomed against the vest. She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him. Carson is overwhelmed with relief. Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head. OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...
C: MIRANDA
D: Go..!
S: EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
N: The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a drive in the country.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes. Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.
S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY
N: As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and Ambassador Han gets in.
C: CARSON
D: Get the fuck out of here!
N: Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson sighs and tears out of the driveway.
S: EXT. FREMONT PLACE - DAY
N: Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane, zooming past the snarl of cars.
S: EXT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.
S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Carson looks around at the chaos around them.
C: CARSON
D: Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out here!
N: Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:

E: into radio beat; into radio
S: INT. NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

C: MIRANDA
D: Listen: the best way to help them is to stay at your computer. If any information comes in, holler. Okay?

D: Okay...
E: into radio
S: EXT. SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: Several large military helicopters approach -- troop contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin. The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES and ARMY INFANTRY. Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.
S: EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
N: People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria. We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's. Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic... Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones. This is the mother of all rush hours.
S: EXT. WESTERN AVENUE - DAY
N: Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English. He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads -- in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down. Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.
S: INT. NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY
N: Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.
C: CARSON
D: ...The Colonel hired Javal, made it look like he was working alone. Then he made sure Javal got killed, so we'd never find your family -- and they'd have an excuse to drop their bomb. But what's in it for 'em?
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: There are men in my government whose power depends on North Korea staying as it is: Socialist, repressive, isolated from the world. They'll resort to anything, even war, to keep it that way. They have the Hitler Syndrome: if their country cannot exist the way they want it, they would rather see it destroyed.
S: EXT. WESTERN AVENUE - DAY
N: Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.

S: INT. APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher. Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel Lee, but there's no time...
C: VREELAND
D: Shit! Pull back!
E: to Pilot
S: EXT. COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
N: Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.
S: EXT. SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY
N: The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two tons of red-hot shrapnel.
S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

E: to TV camera beat; smiles
S: EXT. WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

C: VREELAND
D: Out of the air, or retreat 7,000 meters from target vehicle!

S: EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

S: INT. CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson looks at Ambassador Han:
C: CARSON
D: One of yours? What the hell do you need heat- seeking rockets for in L.A.?
E: Han nods
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: There could be another riot...

S: INT. NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY
N: Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand... WIDER The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station. Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter... Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:
C: BOBBI
D: Save it for someone who gives a shit!
S: EXT. STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
N: All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes. So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best. MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking lots. PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.
S: INT. COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers, angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
N: The windows on the Mercedes glide open.... Carson hurries to catch up to it... Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents through the passenger's side. The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air. The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing a portion of it. Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning wreckage. The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

D: I don't think so -- they said it was solid as a rock.
C: CARSON
D: No shit...
E: looks at his crumpled car
N: As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through. Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel Lee STRAFES the Volvo. Carson looks up just in time to see... A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder. Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck. The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: I can't believe I'm still alive...
E: dazed
C: CARSON
D: This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

S: INT. NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes. It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up. Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece of the seat harness, then slides the door open. He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.
C: CARSON
D: Pull hard to the left, on my signal...
E: to Pilot
N: He braces himself on door jamb... Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

S: EXT. HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

S: INT. NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket. The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor. Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.
S: EXT. HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
N: Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign. She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her. The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him, hitting him across the legs. Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away. VARIOUS ANGLES As Miranda comes down from the sign... Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101... The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up, lights flashing and sirens WAILING. Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the driver's door open before it's stopped. The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.
C: MIRANDA
D: Sorry...
S: INT. AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.
C: MIRANDA
D: You're completely deranged! Playing chicken with rockets!
C: CARSON
D: Well, what the hell were you doing out there?
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: What are both of you doing?
E: OS
N: Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.
C: CARSON
D: Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!
N: Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange. Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that are parting like the Red Sea for him.
C: MIRANDA
D: Even if we can pry him out with... Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll be very cooperative.
E: looks at her watch
C: CARSON
D: I'll just use my outstanding people skills.

C: CARSON
D: That car's like a rock, right?
E: continuing; to Ambassador Han
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
N: Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.
S: INT. COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
N: Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.
S: EXT. GLENDALE BLVD - DAY
N: Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd, running right alongside the lake. With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake. Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out. The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.
S: INT./EXT. COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
N: WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents... Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson with his AMD-74.
S: EXT. ECHO LAKE - DAY
N: Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim... And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water. Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them. CLOSER Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee SLASHES at Carson with a knife. Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper arm. Carson falls backwards. Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly, someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over. It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying. Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists. Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free... Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.
C: MIRANDA
D: Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps? Well, these are fuck you pumps! Where's the family?
E: pushes harder
N: Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

E: continuing; into phone
S: EXT. ECHO LAKE - DAY
N: While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.
C: AMBASSADOR HAN
D: Let him up.
N: Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp. Miranda removes her heel. Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.
C: COLONEL LEE
D: Victory!
N: Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin. Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood. WIDER Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other... Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches through his pockets, looking for something, anything.

C: JOY
D: Mother... Sam...
N: They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han understands... She hesitates, then:
C: MRS. HAN
D: Do it.
N: Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's sitting closest to the window. With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter, sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.
S: INT. PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY
N: Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door to the inner office and rush in.

N: The coast looms closer.
S: EXT. PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY
N: The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away. Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch... Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick, iron balcony railing. Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig 9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass door. He reaches through and unlatches it.
S: INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
N: The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun to creep across the floor and the ceiling. Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM. The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic. In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her mouth. She's freaking out. Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off. She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.
C: CARSON
D: Okay... work with me here!
N: He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.
C: LISA
D: Hurry, please hurry...
N: Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other. Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs. Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs for the front door. Just as she reaches it:
C: CARSON
D: DON'T!
N: He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.
C: CARSON
D: We have to go out the window.
E: continuing
C: MRS. HAN
D: Can't you disarm the bomb?
C: CARSON

D: Sam covered them with chewing gum.

C: SAM
D: You a bomb expert?
C: CARSON
D: Nope. But I've had some car alarms in my day. For all the goddamn good they do...
E: to himself
N: Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.
C: CARSON
D: Slide your arm forward... Watch the meter... Keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow...
E: continuing; to Mrs. Han
N: He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.
C: CARSON
D: It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate the weight of your arm... Okay... pick it up.
E: continuing
N: They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does. The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.
C: CARSON
D: Low-tech solution... Lean back... Carefully.
E: continuing; to Sam to Mrs. Han
N: Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around the seat and wraps it tightly. He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.
C: MIRANDA
D: How's it going in there?
E: VO thru radio in his pocket

As she stands, the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone head begin to PULL the gum away! Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm. Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero. WIDER The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa into the rescue harness. She's terrified.
C: CARSON
D: You'll be over in five seconds...
N: She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so his sister can go. ANGLE ON BOMB One minute... fifty-nine seconds... CARSON sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs. Han into it...
C: CARSON
D: Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line.
N: He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook. ANGLE ON BOMB Thirty seconds... twenty-nine... THE HARNESS slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and tries to undo the hook buckle with the other... But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing. Fifteen seconds to go... Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.
C: CARSON

S: EXT. PARK LA BREA - DAY

S: INT./EXT. APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
N: The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down. BELOW Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down. Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast. Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear as the helicopter lands. Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him... WIDER Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air; helicopters crisscross the scene.

C: MIRANDA
