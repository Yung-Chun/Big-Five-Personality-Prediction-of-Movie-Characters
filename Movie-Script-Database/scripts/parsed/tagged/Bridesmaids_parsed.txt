S: INT. CLEAN, UPSCALE. MODERN BATHROOM.
N: Annie is in nice lingerie, happily getting ready for the day. She puts a lot of effort into her appearance. Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no hair out of place. She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man sleeps. She sneaks back into the bed, carefully positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her good parts. She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend sleeps.
C: TED
D: Good morning. Annie pretends to wake up.
C: TED
D: Wow, you look beautiful.
E: CONT'D
N: ANNIE (ACTING EMBARRASSED) What? No. I don't. Oh my God its the morning. I look terrible. I just woke up.
C: TED
D: Last night was fun.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever... She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her long time lover.
C: TED
D: So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want to be up front with you. I'm not really looking for a relationship right now. Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him, nodding.
C: ANNIE
D: Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?
C: TED
D: I just want to be honest right off the bat.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. Annie struggles to maintain her composure.
C: TED
D: I'm just so busy and I don't have time for another person...I...
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, me too, I'm soo busy--
C: TED
D: And summer's coming--
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, summer, exactly. It's a crazy season. So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--?
C: TED
D: Yeah, I'm not gonna be in town much even in the fall--
C: ANNIE
D: You shouldn't be! Yeah, Halloween--
C: TED
D: I'm gonna be travelling a lot for work.
C: ANNIE
D: Me too, I'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awayâcause I'm doing really well at work.
C: TED
D: And honestly, I don't even know how I feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot of different people.
E: sits up
C: ANNIE
D: It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's science. I'm-I don't want a relationship either. Let's just say that. And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I'm just different from other girls.
C: TED
D: Yeah. Well anyway, I really should get going. I was gonna get a haircut today.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've cut hair before. He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.
C: TED
D: Well, like I said I got stuff to do. Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, me too. Gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy...
C: TED HOLLY
D: Cool, well I don't wanna be Get up the jib.. late. Ted gets up. Awkward moment leading into...
S: EXT. HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. MOMENTS LATER.
C: TED
D: Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, no problem. Made from scratch.
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY
N: Annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted repeatedly presses the button. She smiles at a neighbor.
C: TED
D: Sometimes it sticks!
C: ANNIE
D: No, I love it! The gate starts to open. Annie exits.
C: ANNIE
D: Byyyyee!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE THE GATE
N: Annie sits in her old shitty car. She lets out an exasperated sigh, then sees the clock.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, shit. The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.
S: INT. ANNIE'S CAR IN TRAFFIC. CONTINUOUS.
N: Annie gets out her phone and speed dials LILLIAN.
S: INT. LILLIAN'S BEDROOM.
N: Lillian is getting dressed. Upscale, professional clothes.
C: LILLIAN
D: It's summer?! What the hell does that mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?
C: ANNIE
D: I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid now.
C: LILLIAN
D: No he's stupid Ann, not you.
C: ANNIE
D: I think I might be a little bit stupid.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ew. Did you have sex with him?
C: ANNIE
D: No! But I gave him a blow job.
C: LILLIAN
D: What?!
C: ANNIE
D: Well, he kept putting it in my face. Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh.
C: LILLIAN
D: Well, at least he was honest with you so you don't waste your time with him.
C: DOUGIE
D: Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at all this sweat.
C: LILLIAN
D: Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm talking to Annie.
C: DOUGIE
D: Hey Annie.
C: LILLIAN
D: Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for women you know?
C: DOUGIE
D: Shit. Really?!
C: LILLIAN
D: It's not gonna do anything to you.
C: DOUGIE
D: Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger. He tries to rub up against Lillian.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ew, go take a shower. Dougie leaves.
C: DOUGIE
D: I'm gonna play with my new boobs in there.
E: O.S.
C: LILLIAN
D: I swear I cannot handle him right now. He has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it feels like I'm kissing my brother. I don't know what do. Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the car. A white blouse and navy skirt.
C: ANNIE
D: At least you have someone. God, wha's wrong with me?
C: LILLIAN
D: There's nothing wrong with you. But I think maybe, and don't get mad at me, I've said this to you before, you need to stop trying so hard.
C: ANNIE
D: I still don't think I do that.
C: LILLIAN
D: OK, so you had a first date last night. Did you bring him a present? Annie is silent.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ann, what did I tell you?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: I brought him lemon-bars because I was making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're right, that's weird.
C: DOUGIE
D: Shit!
E: O.S.
C: LILLIAN
D: What?!
C: DOUGIE
D: I just chipped a nail!
E: O.S
C: LILLIAN
D: Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what, but I wanna kill him.
C: ANNIE
D: Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist. Lillian laughs.
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh my God. We need to hang out. 'm coming to Milwaukee this weekend.
C: ANNIE
D: Are you serious?
C: LILLIAN
D: We'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll bring some shitty magazines, and I'm gonna spend the night.
C: ANNIE
D: God, I haven't seen you in months!
C: LILLIAN
D: I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. They hang up. Dougie is in the doorway wearing her nightie stretched over his body.
C: DOUGIE
D: Baby, I'm going through some changes...
C: LILLIAN
D: You're an idiot. We see she gets a kick out of him.
E: laughing
S: INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE.
N: Annie enters hurriedly pulling her hair into a bun.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here.
C: DONNA
D: Annie! Thank God. OK people! Gather around me please, in a tight semicircle. Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.
E: quickly
C: DONNA
D: Something terrible has happened. Donald will not be coming in to work today. He stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling. Employees mumble.
E: CONT'D slightly overdramatic
C: DONNA
D: Annie? Where's your tie? Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to put it on.
E: CONT'D
C: DONNA
D: Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment that I can't change or they'll will charge me. So someone will have to cover for Donald in engagement rings. Now I-- Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the air eagerly.
E: CONT'D
C: DONNA
D: Sandy? Today's your day.
E: CONT'D
C: SANDY
D: Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented with an opportunity at work today. That is eerie. That is eerie.
C: DONNA
D: Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes. You think you can handle it?
C: EMPLOYEE
D: Yeah, look out. There might be a bum- rush for letter openers... The employees snicker.
E: SOTTO
C: ANNIE
D: Sometimes there is, so....there have been. At times, there has been.
C: DONNA
D: Alright everybody, let's get to work! Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME! SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her.
C: ANNIE
D: Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really-
C: DONNA
D: Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English setting?
C: ANNIE
D: Five?
C: DONNA
D: I just made all of that up. None of that was real. I just put words together. You're not ready for the big leagues. Understand?
C: ANNIE
D: It's so hard to make commission over there.
C: DONNA
D: Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer?
C: ANNIE
D: Many times.
C: DONNA
D: She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here. He connects with the customer. And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it.
C: ANNIE
D: Okay. I do want it.
E: beat
C: DONNA
D: Good. Showing up on time is a wonderful place to start. Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.
E: smiling
C: DONNA
D: Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal. It's reckless! Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No? We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.
C: T.V. HOST
D: When Dave and Rhonda bought this house, it was a medical clinic. I've never seen so many cupboards!
S: INT. ANNIE AND STEVE'S APT. THAT NIGHT.
N: STEVE, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch shirtless and is enthralled by the show.
C: STEVE
D: Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart. Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute.
C: STEVE
D: There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over? As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her room.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going to bed?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Yes. I'm beat.
C: STEVE
D: Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what you said and just threw it away.
C: ANNIE
D: Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door behind her.
C: STEVE
D: That credit lady called! She wants to talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you. Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..
C: ALLEN
D: This is where they bagged the animals that didn't make it through the testing. We turned it into a cozy Moroccan reading room.
E: ON SHOW
C: STEVE
D: Gross/Amazing.
S: INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM.
N: She sits on her bed grabs a âSounds to Relaxâ CD with a post-it that reads, âLove, Momâ. She plays it and lies down. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing. NOT relaxing. She turns it off and curls up on top of her bed.
S: INT. JONI'S RESTAURANT. THAT FRIDAY NIGHT.
N: Annie and Lillian read magazines.
C: ANNIE
D: You're right. God, she's getting really skinny.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ann.

D: Your boyfriend just walked in. REVEAL: An orange-skinned BODY BUILDER with HUGE arms and legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts.
E: quietly
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my God! Look, he showed up with your mom. It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking boots. They laugh to themselves. Annie keeps reading.
C: ANNIE
D: Cool! They're making a WKRP movie.
E: CONT'D
C: LILLIAN
D: Here Annie, let me turn the page for you.
C: ANNIE
D: What? Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
C: LILLIAN
D: I just want to help you turn the page of your magazine for you...
E: playfully
C: ANNIE
D: Lillian! What is that?!
C: LILLIAN
D: I'm engaged.
C: ANNIE
D: What?!!
C: LILLIAN
D: He proposed at dinner last night. I wanted to tell you in person and show you this rock!
C: ANNIE
D: It's beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this is...this is crazy!
C: LILLIAN
D: I know Dougie and I have been fighting a lot, but I've been so stressed out with
N: WORK--
C: ANNIE
D: That's not I mean. I mean, I remember when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember?
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh you want to get into who's done what down at the lake?
C: ANNIE
D: No, I don't. It's just making me realize how long we've known each other.
C: LILLIAN
D: Well then, who better to be my Maid of Honor?
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my God! I don't know what to say!
C: LILLIAN
D: Annie, you're my best friend. Honestly I didn't even have to think about it.
C: ANNIE
D: Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God. I've never been in a wedding.
C: LILLIAN
D: It's no big deal, and I don't want to make it one. It's not gonna be a big crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple. What dessert are you gonna get?
E: beat
C: ANNIE
D: I know what you're doing. Don't downplay this. I'm happy for you. And someday when hell freezes over and I get married, you can be my Maid of Honor. But for right now, this is about you. OK? This is you're day, and it is a big deal.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ok, but I still don't want this to be a huge production. I just want to have all my friends meet each other, have fun, dance, drink, whatever.
C: ANNIE
D: Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys set a date?
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh God, not yet. I don't want a super long engagement, but there's a lot to do.
C: ANNIE
D: Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and-- Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.
C: LILLIAN
D: Can you hold that thought. I's my fiancee calling. Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.
E: mocking
C: ANNIE
D: Ooo, haha... Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room as her smile disappears. She remembers...

But some people I know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that. And people who are not nice...that's ugly to me. And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird. I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have better ones. The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone.

C: LILLIAN
D: Ann, stop.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party?
C: LILLIAN

D: Annie! Great job tonight..
C: ANNIE
D: I'm feeling slightly mortified.
C: HELEN
D: No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets...are you ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Vegas.
C: ANNIE
D: Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things?
C: HELEN
D: Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and--

C: HELEN
D: Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.
C: ANNIE
D: Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen.
C: GUEST
D: Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You have beautiful cursive.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.
C: HELEN
D: Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you couldn't do it. I'm sure you are aware of all your duties. We'll see--we'll see you soon. Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her.

C: MAN IN SURGEONS SCRUBS
D: No I will!
N: MAN IN RED BATHING SUIT I'll get it! I'm a lifeguard. Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her. The chaos forces Annie to make a DRAMATIC EXIT from the CASTLE. She runs down the stairs like Cinderella into the forest. They men begin to chase her. She runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to face with a sexy, sweaty, lumberjack, wh's chopping wood. It's CHRISTIAN BALE.

S: INT. ANNIE'S DRESSING ROOM.
N: Helen has flung open Annie's dressing room curtain, putting an abrupt end to her fantasy. She is wearing cream colored lingerie, showing off her TOTALLY amazing body. Annie is uncomfortable.
C: HELEN
D: Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh, is that the dress you like?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash--
C: HELEN
D: A sash? Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts.
C: ANNIE
D: Huh?
C: DANA
D: I told you Becca I can't wear strapless!
E: O.S.
C: BECCA
D: Why not?! Annie and Helen come out to see all the bridesmaids arguing.
E: O.S.
C: DANA
D: Because, I--
C: LESLIE
D: Why don't you two shut your traps? No one's going to be looking at us. Le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway.
C: MEGAN
D: I gotta say I'm still leaning towards the one that I found. It is a very ugly.
C: LESLIE
D: Absolutely not.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, what about this one? Everybody stops and looks at Annie.
C: ANNIE
D: I think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again. The sash comes in different colors not just this one.
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: Everyone! We can't all have the dress that we want. I've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, âIf invited, would I wear this a dress to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!â
C: DANA
D: Ooo, I never thought of it that way. All the girls agree.
C: HELEN
D: With that in mind, I say we wear this one. Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it.
C: ANNIE
D: Or this one! People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time.
C: HELEN
D: Only if they're nominated for the Sound of Music.
C: ANNIE
D: I think Lillian would like this one.
C: HELEN
D: Well, I think Lillian would like THIS one. Lillian walks in.
C: LILLIAN
D: Hey! I'm hearing lots of excitement in here. She touches Helen's dress.
C: LILLIAN
D: Oooo, I like this one. What about you guys?
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: I love it. Right guys? The girls all agree. Except Annie.
C: LILLIAN
D: Cool. Let's eat! Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows Lillian.
C: HELEN
D: I think it might look best in cream.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ooh, good idea. They exit.
C: LESLIE
D: Well, that was easy. The girls head back to change.
C: ANNIE
D: This dress is almost $500!
C: DANA/BECCA
D: That's not too bad/that sounds about right.
C: ANNIE
D: No, that's what I'm saying. That's a great price.
N: EXT. âOCCASIONZ RESTAURANT' BRIDAL-THEMED CAFE. PATIO. Andrea Bocceli music playing. Waiters in tuxes etc. The girls sit at a beautiful table looking at men's.
C: LILLIAN
D: This place is kind of amazing. I did't even know it existed.
C: BECCA
D: The southwestern cobb is really good. I come here and eat sometimes.
C: MEGAN
D: Great, there's a fly that really likes me.
C: ANNIE
D: They only have salads.
C: DANA
D: So Annie, what's your deal? Are you dating anyone?
C: ANNIE
D: No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago.
C: BECCA
D: Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What happened?
C: ANNIE
D: It just didn't work out.
C: HELEN
D: Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an STD? Everyone freezes.
C: HELEN
D: Lillian told me. Annie shoots Lillian a look.
E: CONT'D
C: LILLIAN
D: I'm sorry, I was just talking about you cause I was worried about you and--
C: ANNIE
D: No it's fine. But he didn't steal the money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is really common right now. Everyone looks around.
C: ANNIE
D: Around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives and by age fifty, eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital HPV infection.
E: CONT'D
C: LESLIE
D: Really?
C: ANNIE
D: About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year.
C: MEGAN
D: Ew, it's on the butter you guys. The fly's on the butter.
C: HELEN
D: Well, I don't have it.
C: ANNIE
D: Very few HPV infections show any signs or symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner. Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..
C: ANNIE
D: Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past. We weren't meant to be. My last pap-smear came back normal so that's cule. But you know, I'm dating, here and there...
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding?
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I didn't even think about that.
C: LESLIE
D: Who needs a date? Just go stag and make out with someone there.
C: DANA
D: If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you should come to karaoke night at my church. We sing hymns to rock beats!
C: BECCA
D: Wait. I have the perfect guy for you Annie. Mike Donahue. He went to school with Kevin.
C: LILLIAN
D: Mike from the fourth of July last year? Ooh, I've seen him Ann. He's hot.
C: ANNIE
D: Really?
C: BECCA
D: And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. But he's totally down to earth. You guys have to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now.
C: HELEN
D: I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.
C: MEGAN
D: The fly just committed suicide. Death by butter.
C: DANA
D: Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time!
C: LESLIE
D: Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel.
C: HELEN
D: Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today.
E: sotto
C: DANA
D: I was set up with Ernie. As soon as I met him, I knew.
C: LILLIAN
D: Yeah Annie, you never know.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY. ANNIE DRIVING BACK
N: Annie is lost in thought. She hears. Sirens.
C: ANNIE
D: What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches.
C: RHODES
D: Well, look who it is.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh hi.
C: RHODES
D: I see your still driving around with busted tail lights.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I forgot . You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?
E: laughing
C: RHODES
D: Nah... The reason I pulled you over today, is that-- you were driving too slow. Backing up traffic.
E: searching
C: ANNIE
D: I was?
C: RHODES
D: Yep. You were going ten miles under the speed limit. That's a moving violation. It's...underdriving. It's in the books. But, I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but I do have to um...write some stuff down on a piece of paper. He begins to write. Beat.
C: RHODES
D: Man I'm hungry. I'm doing the Master Cleanse. You ever heard of it?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
C: RHODES
D: Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff?
C: ANNIE
D: Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness.
C: ANNIE
D: Sorry.
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We had tampons in the pencil drawer. Sometimes my friends and I would say they were cigars and smoke'em. Okay. I have finished writing down the things I need to write, on this paper. OH! He hands her a business card.
E: beat
C: RHODES
D: This is a buddy of mine. Owns a body shop in Milwaukee. Might be able to help you out for a good price with those taillights. I'll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred you.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Thanks.
C: RHODES
D: That's my name right there. In case you forgot it from last time. It's Nathan Rhodes.
C: ANNIE
D: Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I get paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.
S: INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE. DAYTIME.
C: ANNIE
D: Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time. Nothing says âI'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.
C: ANNIE
D: We also have yo-yos you can engrave. In memory of...um, what's your friend's name? The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches.
E: CONT'D
C: SANDY
D: Paychecks. Here you go Annie. She and Sandy open their checks.
C: SANDY
D: Oh my God, I scored this week. 'm gonna buy Sharita a new Panasonic telephone. It's cordless and has intercom. What about you Annie?
E: CONT'D

S: INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM
N: Annie is on the phone as she gets ready for her date with Mike.
C: ANNIE
D: Help me! I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight.
C: LILLIAN
D: I don't know. Shoot, I can't talk now. I'm with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu about my dress. Ugh. I'm so sorry. She's calling! I gotta go. Have fun! Lillian hangs up. Steve walks in.
C: STEVE
D: That credit lady called you again. I told her you were at the tailors.
C: ANNIE
D: Listen, I'm going on a date. This? or this?
E: holds up a dress what she's wearing
C: STEVE
D: I don't like those pants.
C: ANNIE
D: What's wrong with'em?
C: STEVE
D: They give you four corners. Annie's not following.
C: STEVE
D: It's when a girls butt looks like it has four corners. It's not a good thing.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Shit. These are my only clean pants.
C: STEVE
D: Do you have a tube skirt?
C: ANNIE
D: Thanks Steve.
C: STEVE
D: Wait. If you stand like you are right now facing that angle, it looks good. She looks in the mirror again, grabs her bag and leaves.
S: INT. THAI RESTAURANT. THAT NIGHT. BAR AREA.
N: Annie sits next to Mike Donahue. He is tall, dark and handsome. They have cocktails.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but I've always been interested in it. So, yeah I totally agree. Mike smiles, he is cute!
C: MIKE
D: I have to admit, I told Becca 'm not really keen on set-ups. I know i's early, but so far so good.
C: ANNIE
D: Me too.
C: MIKE
D: And thanks again for coming from Milwaukee, I know it's quite a drive.
C: ANNIE
D: I can do that drive in my sleep these days.
C: MIKE
D: Next time maybe I'll come to you. Annie smiles.
C: MIKE
D: You have got great teeth.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Thank you. I brush'em every day. She flashes her teeth. The hostess comes up.
C: HOSTESS
D: Your tables ready.
C: MIKE
D: Finally! Mike guzzles down his cocktail as they read their menus.
C: MIKE
D: Well, I don't know about you but since we're at a Thai restaurant, I'm gonna try the dog. Mike laughs at his own joke and continues drinking.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: So, Becca tells me you play a lot of tennis.
C: MIKE
D: I try to squeeze in a game now and then. We should play sometime.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, yeah I haven't rea--
N: MIKE (GETTING LOUDER) Yeah, my game's pretty solid. I did win a couple tournaments at the club. I tend to- Jesus Christ! (whispers) It smells like B.O. in here huh? I think it's the people. A very effeminate waiter brings them their drinks.
C: WAITER
D: Here ya go. I'll be back to take your order in two secs. I'm swamped!
C: ANNIE
D: No problem.
C: MIKE
D: Whoa, get a load of our waiter. 'm surprised he didn't put pink umbrellas in our drinks... Annie laughs, but is a little uncomfortable.
C: MIKE
D: Or AIDS. Mike laughs. Annie is HORRIFIED. Mike swigs from his drink.
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Seriously, AIDS is crazy. You do't have it do you?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: No.
C: MIKE
D: Neither do I... He raises his eyebrows up and down at her.
E: singing
C: LATER.
D: Annie hasn't touched her food. He's eating with his hands and drunk. Other patrons are beginning to stare.
N: MIKE (LAUGHING) So I started to get a little chub, you know what that is. How could I not with those huge canteloupes waving in my face. Anyway, I looovee massages, am I right? As he's laughing he lets out a huge burp.
C: MIKE
D: Whoa-ho! Excyuuuuse me! I got that from Steve Martin. Still laughing, he pats his pockets.
E: CONT'D still laughing
C: MIKE
D: Oh shit. I forgot my wallet.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. MINI-MART. LATER THAT NIGHT.
N: Annie's car pulls up.
S: INT. MINI MART
N: Annie is on the phone, looking at the herbal drinks. âCalmâ âFocusâ âSex Appealâ âLeanâ. She finally picks âCalmâ. RHODES appears holding a bag of mini carrots.
C: ANNIE
D: Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night. Oh my God. Call me.
C: RHODES
D: Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car out there.
C: ANNIE
D: Very funny, Officer...Jones?
C: RHODES
D: Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was.
C: ANNIE
D: No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk.
C: RHODES
D: That's ok. Call me Rhodes. Trying to get âcalmâ?
E: notices her drink
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. Recovering from a date.
C: RHODES
D: Oh.
C: ANNIE
D: Finish your cleanse?
C: RHODES
D: Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods I like eating.
S: EXT - MINIMART. CONTINOUS.
C: ANNIE
D: Thanks for the drink. So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people?
E: beat
C: RHODES
D: A lot of people get up to high speeds on this road. I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral.
C: ANNIE
D: That's a very good point.
C: OFFICER RHODES
D: Want a carrot?
C: ANNIE
D: Yes. I'm starving.
C: CONTINUOUS:
D: They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots.
C: ANNIE
D: Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot.
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
C: ANNIE
D: The what?
C: RHODES
D: There's one in every bag. You should eat it.
C: ANNIE
D: No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.
C: ANNIE
D: No, no! Don't eat it! EW!!! She throws it on the ground.
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: Don't litter. He picks it up.
S: INT. RHODES' POLICE CAR.
C: ANNIE
D: I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life.
C: RHODES
D: Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems unnatural.
C: ANNIE
D: I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up.
C: RHODES
D: Just tell her the truth.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.
C: ANNIE
D: It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's unpredictable. I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students.
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors. You can stand at the same door forever if you want. Or you can open a different door. And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway, it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I knew I was a cop. And I love my job.
C: ANNIE
D: Hmm. I think I get it?
C: RHODES
D: Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road.
C: ANNIE
D: Moonpies. What?
C: RHODES
D: It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your car the first time I pulled you over.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh yeah.
S: INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT COUNTER. LATER
N: They are waiting in line.
C: OFFICER RHODES
D: When I get married I don't want the kind of wedding people have these days. I want it to be like a carnival. You know dunk tanks? People win prizes...
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight.
C: OFFICER RHODES
D: Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding and I'm talking about a carnival wedding.
C: ANNIE
D: Sorry. Yeah I'll have the number four, and can you make that Super Biggie?
E: to clerk
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: They are sitting in the restaurant, mouths full of BURGERS
C: OFFICER RHODES
D: And then she moved to Hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice. And supposedly she has really long armpit hair now. That's pretty much the last girlfriend I had.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I lived with broke up with me over the phone. Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that I'm still paying off. Because I can't find him.
C: OFFICER RHODES
D: Wow. You win.
C: ANNIE'S CAR. CONTINUOUS.
D: Annie in her car, engine running.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my gosh. It's twelve thirty! I should probably...
C: RHODES
D: Oh, before you go. There is something I want to give you. I was gonna wait but, I think you'll want this now. He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.
C: ANNIE
D: For me?!
C: OFFICER RHODES
D: Well I know you've had a terrible night. He gives it to her. Her phone rings.
C: ANNIE
D: Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec? She waves at Rhodes and mouths...
C: ANNIE
D: I guess I'll see you around?
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: Yeah. Don't forget about those taillights. They're really starting to bug me.
C: ANNIE
D: K. Bye. So, you're in town?
E: to Ted
S: EXT - TED'S HOUSE. NEXT MORNING.
N: He opens the front door, leading Annie out again.
C: TED
D: Next time I won't call so late.
C: ANNIE
D: No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I was just driving.
C: TED
D: Awesome. It's cool that we can just hookup and whatever. No strings.
C: ANNIE
D: Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.
C: TED
D: Cool. Bye.
S: EXT. GAS STATION. CONTINUOUS.
N: Annie pulls in, her tank is way passed empty. She looks in her purse frantically.
C: ANNIE
D: Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit card at the restaurant! Shit! She picks up her phone and dials.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi, Donna, it's Annie. Um, sorry but I just ran out of gas and I'm gonna be a little bit late. Yes, I know, 'm really sorry. I will get there as soon as I can. I promise, I'm so sor---hello?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE.
N: Annie comes running onto the floor putting her tie on.
C: HELEN
D: Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were late. Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.
C: HELEN
D: I had to come into Milwaukee for a charity luncheon right down the street and I thought I'd come in and say hi.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Hi!
C: HELEN
D: And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
C: ANNIE
D: Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't that technically be me? Honor?
C: HELEN
D: Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something. That would be fun. Where are the diamonds?
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy.
C: HELEN
D: Oh! And Annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes. Yes. I'm on it. Got some ideas. So I'll let you know.
C: HELEN
D: Can't wait.
S: INT. ANNIE'S APT. THAT NIGHT.
N: Annie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on the couch watching the same Home Improvement show.
C: TV HOST
D: Wow, well I have never seen a transformation like this. This old tour bus is stunning.
C: GIRL ON SHOW
D: Thanks.
C: STEVE
D: Unbelievable. You got another package from your mom.
E: to Annie
C: ANNIE
D: Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer.
C: STEVE
D: No problem. But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank. Especially cause you have such a shitty car.
C: ANNIE
D: Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas?
C: STEVE
D: Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a black hole but I must have it in my life. Does that make sense?
C: ANNIE
D: I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been.
C: STEVE
D: Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings. When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay?
C: ANNIE
D: No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride.
C: STEVE
D: Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets. Remember this morning? You cannot afford Vegas.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I could save up for it.
C: STEVE
D: No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday. Ooh, âNight Moves.â Can I have this? A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag.
C: ANNIE
D: Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We see these words: âDear bridal partyâ, âgreat ideaâ, âbachelorette partyâ, âFloridaâ, âSea World!â, âFree place to stay!â. She presses send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately rings.
C: ANNIE
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: Hi.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi.
C: HELEN
D: Hiiiii.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames.
C: HELEN
D: I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World?
C: ANNIE
D: Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days.
C: HELEN
D: But a bachelorette at Sea World?
C: ANNIE
D: Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it.
C: HELEN
D: Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie's other line rings.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, can you hold on? That's my other line. She clicks over.
C: ANNIE
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D
C: BECCA
D: Hi, Annie. It's Becca. Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says âThe Whitman'sâ
C: BECCA
D: I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute. Sea World. What about Turkey? That's where we went for for MY bachelorette.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Oh well, Turkey's really far away.
C: BECCA
D: It's super old though! They have awesome restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you ever seen Aladdin? It totally looks like that.
C: ANNIE
D: Hang on... Annie clicks back over to Helen.
C: ANNIE
D: Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back?
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: When?
C: ANNIE
D: Just a few minutes. I'll call you back. Annie clicks over.
C: ANNIE
D: Becca?
E: CONT'D
C: BECCA
D: Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me.
C: BECCA
D: I never get sick of it. I love blackjack. I have a system. Annie's other line.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call you back?
C: BECCA
D: When?
C: ANNIE
D: Soon. Annie clicks over.

C: DANA
D: I love your idea about Sea World.
C: ANNIE
D: Really?
C: DANA
D: Yeah, but then Helen just called me and said we should go to Vegas.
C: ANNIE
D: But Vegas is so hot, don't you think? It's like, hot and dry. People get sick there all the time.
C: DANA
D: I haven't had that experience. My skin always clears up there.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, I just think it's probably not-- Hold on. Hello?
E: clicks over
C: MEGAN
D: Annie, it's Megan. Megan is at work, in front of a wall of computer and television screens. It is a technical haven, looks like
N: NASA.
C: MEGAN
D: I can't talk right now, but I was thinking for the bachelorette, something more along the lines of a personal challenge weekend. Have you ever heard of the Nevada Project?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: No. Leslie in her Sopranos style living room on a treadmill. Her kids run around.
E: defeated
C: LESLIE
D: I gotta be honest. I've been married for nine years, this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and I want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the face at some point during this trip. I'll pay whatever I have to pay. Tyler stop it, put that back! Paul!
E: to the kids
T: QUICK CUTS BETWEEN:
C: BECCA
D: Vegas has these party busses that have flat screens in them and dance floors--
C: DANA
D: Or we could take hummer limos around everywhere.
C: ANNIE
D: That sounds really expensive.
C: HELEN
D: Oh but it's gonna be so much fun! Besides money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's our friend.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh no, no, I was just thinking about everyone else. That's all I'm saying.
C: MEGAN
D: What I'm saying is, they drop you off in the middle of the desert. You have to kill your own food and find your way back. Not everyone makes it. Seriously.
C: LESLIE
D: Seriously. I want balls in my face.
C: BECCA
D: So I think Vegas is a good idea.
C: DANA
D: I agree with Helen. Vegas.
C: MEGAN
D: Oh, you know what else is in Nevada? Vegas!
C: LESLIE

C: LILLIAN
D: I'm so sorry. I was at our travel agen's trying to figure out how to get my da's family out here, they all have to fly at different times, uggh. What's that on your arms? She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion.
C: ANNIE
D: Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it.
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one thing really quick. When is my hair consultation? Lillian frantically looks through her calender.

C: LILLIAN
D: It's our wedding night though!
C: ANNIE
D: You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed.
C: LILLIAN
D: I can't believe this. This sucks. Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you. Do you think for the cocktail party before the reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio?
E: beat
C: ANNIE'
D: Can you just realize what you just asked me right now?
C: LILLIAN
D: What?
C: ANNIE
D: You just said a string trio or horn trio. I thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just âkeep it simple.â âNot a big deal.â
C: LILLIAN
D: I know but now that I'm planning everything it's just...I wanna do it right. It's once in a life time. It's my wedding. Lillian's phone rings.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ugh! It's Dougie's Mom. She's mad at me because I won't let her invite everyone from her work. Oh! That reminds me. If you're not going to bring anybody, will you let me know? I gotta free up some spots. (into phone] Hello? Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is speechless.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ANNIE'S LAUNDRY ROOM.

C: HELEN
D: Annie, the shower needs to happen soon. We haven't heard from you and everyone is-
C: ANNIE
D: I know. I know. I'm trying to--
C: HELEN
D: Annie can I dialog openly with you? I know you're having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I did the shower. Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and I think what's important here is what's best for Lillian.
C: ANNIE
D: Wow.
C: HELEN
D: You don't have to give me an answer now
N: BUT--

S: INT. HARRINGTONS. LATER
N: Annie behind her counter.
C: GIRL
D: Excuse me!! A snotty thirteen year old, valley-type, rich girl stands at Annie's counter with an iced coffee chewing gum.
C: GIRL
D: I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Your best friend?
C: GIRL
D: Yeah.
C: ANNIE
D: For now.
C: GIRL
D: (sip] What do you mean?
C: ANNIE
D: Well, what's gonna happen when you get older? Did you ever think of that? What about when she makes new friends and they're more successful than you are? Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping.
C: ANNIE
D: Huh? And they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yo're stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's outfit cost more than your rent?
E: CONT'D
C: GIRL
D: Ummm....you're weird.
C: ANNIE
D: You're stupid.
C: GIRL
D: You have no chin.
C: ANNIE
D: You're gonna be a slut in high school.
C: GIRL
D: You are an old, single loser who has no friends, works in a jewelry store, colors her own hair, and will never know the feeling of owning a luxury car.
N: She sips in victory, slurps up the last drop noisily.
C: ANNIE
D: (quietly] You. Little. Cunt. The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show that the girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time.
S: INT. DONNA'S OFFICE
N: Donna stands across from Annie wh's cleaning out her locker. She sadly starts to leave.
C: ANNIE
D: Bye.
C: DONNA
D: You know, I knew a girl once. Karen Stippleton. She was really something. The life of the party, a concert pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night. But one evening at a dinner party I walked in on her in the bathroom putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last I heard, she was playing the saxophone outside of a drug store. And I'm gonna say something to you I should have told her. Don't waste your life. Find out what your gifts are and use them. Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room.
S: INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT. LATER THAT DAY.
N: Annie arrives completely depressed. Outside her doorstep is yet another package. Annie takes it inside.
S: INT. ANNIE'S APT.
C: STEVE
D: Ooh, another package from your mom?
C: ANNIE
D: Yep. It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her name and address in calligraphy. When Annie opens the lid, âCanon in Dâ plays and a real butterfly flies out.
N: She reads, âA Shower for Lillian.â Steve comes over to see. On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates. Annie takes the invitation out, opens it quickly.
C: ANNIE
D: Are you kidding me? The invitation reads:
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: Please join us for a Parisian Brunch at the home of Helen Harris III to celebrate the marriage of Lillian Donovan and Douglas Price. Let us âshowerâ Lillian with gifts and love.

I'm Helen Harris IV, and this is me saying au revoir! But before I do, here's a message from SUSAN SARANDON!
E: V.O.
C: SUSAN SARANDON
D: Hello, I'm Susan Sarandon, the movie star. I just wanted to say congratulations to Lillian and Dougie. Even though I don't believe in marriage, I do âbelieve in the church of basebalâ. Just kidding. That's a line from my movie Bull Durham. I- Annie hangs up quickly.
E: V.O.
S: INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT. DAYTIME.
N: Annie's relaxation CD is playing as she lies talking on the phone to her Mom, who is painting a very life-like picture of Enrique Iglesias in concert.
C: JUDY
D: Is there an animal over there?
C: ANNIE
D: No, it's a C.D. She rolls over and turns it off.
C: JUDY
D: So, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day of the shower cause I wanna get my hair done. Did you see that invitation? I didn't get the significance of the dead butterfly, but it looks like w're gonna have fun.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm not.
C: JUDY
D: Oh, c'mon.
C: ANNIE
D: I already know what it's gonna be like. It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I don't wanna go.
C: JUDY
D: Sweetie, listen to yourself. You ca't let her new friends get in the way of your being a part of one of the best days of Lil's life. NO way. You have a history with her that no one else has. So you walk into that party knowing that.
S: INT. ANNIE'S CAR.
N: Annie drives to Helen's. She sees a pink and white highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit sign) âLillian's Shower Rue. This exitâ
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my God. She turns into the gates of âWhitewater Estates.â There is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom. As she gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by. At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray.
C: BUTLER
D: Are you a guest of Helen Harris?
C: ANNIE
D: Yes.
C: BUTLER
D: The shower is one mile away. He hands her a pink lemonade.
C: ANNIE
D: I don't have a cup-holder. As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside her car.
N: ANNIE (CONT'D)
C: WHAT THE-
D: One flies in her car. They're Rose petals! Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and take it.
C: VALET
D: This will be placed in the gift room for you madame. He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.
C: ANNIE
D: I'll take those.
N: Annie watches the valet drives her car away. When she turns back around, there is a man with a white horse holding out his hand to her.
C: HORSEMAN
D: Would you like an assisted ride to the main house?
C: ANNIE
D: Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She dismounts. The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...
C: SHOWER GIRLS
D: This is the most amazing shower 've ever been to/Can you believe this?/What a lucky bride/What a good friend... Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round âsignâ that says âLillian and Dougieâ in puffy pink cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it.
C: BECCA AND LESLIE
D: Annie! They walk to her.
E: O.S.
C: LESLIE
D: Do you believe this shit? Annie is still staring at the sign.
C: BECCA
D: That's a big cookie huh.
C: ANNIE
D: Where? They point to the âsignâ. Annie walks closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie.
C: LESLIE
D: See. Sugar cookie.
N: Leslie takes a piece off, eats it.
C: LESLIE
D: It's even better if you dip it in the chocolate. REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big cookie, laughing. Helen is there taking their praise. Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a nearby table.
E: CONT'D
C: LILLIAN
D: Annieee!!! Lillian runs to her.
C: LILLIAN
D: Can you believe this?
E: CONT'D under her breath

E: under her breath
C: HELEN
D: What did you say?
C: ANNIE
D: I said I love this shower, and i's amazing. I said all that. Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets approach Helen and jam out in her face.

C: ANNIE
D: I'm sure they're perfect and amazing.
C: MEGAN
D: They're dogs!
C: ANNIE
D: What?
C: MEGAN
D: Yeah. And they're wrapped up like presents. They said we have to wait until we leave but I cant stop thinking about them. I gotta go tell Lillian.
N: EXT- HELEN'S BACK YARD- MOMENTS LATER Annie now stands next to the chocolate fountain. She looks around, drops her glass in it and unplugs it with her foot. It stops flowing. She looks around and throws some leaves in it and walks away. CONTINUOUS

S: INT. HELEN'S GREAT ROOM. LATER.
N: Everyone sits surrounded by decorations, pictures of Dougie and Lillian as babies, flowers, fire in the fireplace.

D: Everyone it's game time! Please take your piece of paper, put it on top of your head, and with your other hand try to draw what Lillian and Dougie's first baby is going to look like!!! Ready? GO! Everyone draws, giggles, looks at their stupid drawings, laughing. Annie cheats and draws it on her lap.
N: CONTINUOUS:

C: SHOWER GIRLS
D: Find the veil! C'mon Ellie! Come on Look! You can do it! It's right there! Ellie feels around in the huge pile of pillows. She finds the veil, holds it up in victory and then falls down from dizziness.

E: under her breath, to the woman next to her
C: HELEN
D: OK, last one. For the big prize. #10. What is the craziest place Lillian and Dougie....? Helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of saying, â...had sex?â Shower Girls Ooooh and Ahhhh.
C: ANNIE
D: Wow, looks like someone's a pervert. It's none of my business. She's gross.
E: under her breath
N: CONTINUOUS: GIRL 1 (very emotional) I'm putting a blue bead on this âadvice necklaceâ to represent the ocean. It may not always be smooth sailing but you can ride the waves together. Dana cries and takes a picture. Everyone applauds,
C: ANNIE
D: The ocean's are really polluted right now. Its not something to joke about.
E: to person near her
N: INT-HELEN'S GREAT ROOM - HALF HOUR LATER Lillian opens presents in front of huge photograph of herself.

E: opens it
C: ANNIE
D: Well, you registered for 'em so thank yourself, you picked them out. I did't do anything...

C: ANNIE
D: Nothing have fun at Sea World.
C: HELEN
D: Why don't we go in the other room and--
C: ANNIE
D: Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky little cream and white cashmere--.
C: HELEN
D: Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really don't know what you mean.
C: ANNIE
D: I think you do. Horses? Sculptures? Posters? Look at this stupid house! This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture! And look at that cookie! Would you please everyone! Speaking of that cookie. I never got a piece! Annie marches into the back yard.
E: laughs pointing outside
C: ANNIE
D: (shouting, we see her through the large
E: CONT'D
C: WINDOWS)
D: Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?! You know what!? 'll help you out! She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it. We watch her from the house. Fall over with the cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over, it's obviously too heavy. She tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground.
C: ANNIE
D: Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate! Hello swan, are you having fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers?
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone is watching Annie. She is fighting and punching the air like a crazy person, chasing a swan. A little girl starts crying. Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd holding her chocolate covered hands in the air.
C: ANNIE
D: I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That's not who I am. I make bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls. I don't like Mike Donahue cause he () on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her.
E: CONT'D
C: LILLIAN
D: Annie stop! I don't know what's going on.
C: ANNIE
D: Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit.
C: LILLIAN
D: I'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery. Do you know how selfish that sounds?
C: ANNIE
D: I'm selfish? You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you!
C: LILLIAN
D: This is my wedding and you've made it all about you.
C: ANNIE
D: Well at least my friendship's not for sale. This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms back inside.
C: HELEN
D: Do you think she still has body lice?
C: LILLIAN
D: Anyone else?! Anyone else have something they wanna say to me?! Dana can't contain herself.
C: DANA
D: I got my chin done! Becca stands up.
C: BECCA
D: Kevin smokes pot! Leslie stands up.
C: LESLIE
D: I'm pregnant! Megan stands up.
C: MEGAN
D: I took two dogs already. There in the back of my van!
S: INT. ANNIE'S CAR. MOMENTS LATER- HIGHWAY.
N: Annie is pissed. She sees a squirrel in the road (close up of squirrels big eyes). She tries to avoid it, slams on her breaks and BOOM! Annie is rear-ended! The driver behind her backs up, peels out and drives away.
C: ANNIE
D: Thank you! Her car won't start. Trying to keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway, trying not to cry. A cop car pulls next to her. I's Rhodes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Rhodes is looking under her hood.
C: RHODES
D: Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes. Taillights. I know!
C: RHODES
D: You should've taken it to my friend-
C: ANNIE
D: I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't--
C: RHODES
D: Whoa. Don't take it out on me. This is your fault.
C: ANNIE
D: HE hit ME!
C: RHODES
D: You had no taillights! You did't get them fixed! You don't get to blame anyoe else. It's your fault. Annie starts to walk away.
C: RHODES
D: Where you going?! Annie keeps walking.
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?! Another WISE decision!
E: CONT'D
N: ANNIE (TURNING AROUND) What do you know?!!
C: RHODES
D: I know that you not taking responsibility is why we're standing out here! YOU did not make an effort to fix that problem. This hits Annie. Rhodes is physically worked up.
N: RHODES (CONT'D) DO YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY THAT DRIVES ME?! SEEING YOU ALL THE TIME, AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN THOSE FIXED?! DO YOU KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING THAT IS?!
C: ANNIE
D: Why are you yelling at me?!
C: RHODES
D: It's dangerous! You're putting your life, and others in danger!
C: ANNIE
D: I'm! Sorry! He calms down.
C: RHODES
D: Look, all I know, is that you're kinda crazy. You're always stressed out or late, complaining about something, and now you're yelling at me! And for some reason, all I've ever wanted to do is ask you on a date.
C: ANNIE
D: Well save yourself the trouble, and don't.
C: RHODES
D: Yeah, I'm not much of a hickey guy anyway. Annie remembers her hickey. He saw it?!
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I have said ânoâ anyway.
C: RHODES
D: Well, then you have yourself a good night ma'am. Annie regrets that. He drives away leaving her there. She is alone.
S: EXT. BILL COZBI'S AUTO ELECTRIC.
N: Annie's car gets towed into the shop.
S: INT - BILL COZBI'S AUTO ELECTRIC

C: BILL
D: Rhodes told me a while back you might be stopping in. I'm Bill Cozbi.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, hi.
C: BILL
D: I was beginning to think we'd never see ya.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.
C: BILL
D: Nah, no one likes taking care of that stuff. But you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so.
C: ANNIE
D: A week?
S: INT. STEVE'S CAR. CONTINUOUS.
C: STEVE
D: So you kind of had a bad time at the wedding shower?
C: ANNIE
D: Yes I did. Everything's just... She starts crying. Steve hands her a tissue from the middle console.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm sorry, I just--this has been a really shitty day.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVE
D: Yeah. Ok, don't get mad at me, but it seems like you have a lot of those.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes I do! Right? Thank you.
C: STEVE
D: Have you considered the idea that maybe, possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes them shitty? Annie stares at him.
C: STEVE
D: I'm just saying, maybe it's your attitude.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: This is not about attitude. It's just the facts! My life hasn't turned it out the way I expected. I don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world.
C: STEVE
D: I think that might be your problem. I think you read too many of those magazines. You don't need things to be someone. Tyra said that. Tyra Banks.
S: INT. ANNIE AND STEVE'S APT.
N: Annie sits on the couch with Steve in a daze, watching
C: 'S

D: Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself.
C: ANNIE
D: Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do. Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good. NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING. But it's not your fault. Its me. It's me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her stuff and leaves.

D: We were all supposed to get spray-tans today and she never showed up. No on's heard from her. She could be anywhere, doing anything! She could be ANYWHERE--
C: LESLIE
D: Jesus Christ, give me the God damn phone. Leslie grabs the phone from Megan.
C: LESLIE
D: Annie, it's Leslie. Look, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. The weddin's the day after tomorrow, she's been really stressed, so she just probably freaked out and went somewhere. We just want to find her and probably talk her off a ledge. Any ideas?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Um, gosh I..I don't know. Um, I'll come to you guys. I'll be there in an hour and 45 minutes. I wanna help. Annie hangs up, grabs her keys. She stops, comes back and grabs a small paper bag, and runs out the door.

S: EXT. HIGHWAY. CONTINUOUS
N: Annie pulls over. She puts the piece of paper in the small paper bag. She gets out of the car, leaving it running. A few seconds later she comes back without the bag. Takes a deep breath and drives away.
S: INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. 2 HOURS LATER.
C: DANA
D: Maybe she's at the park.
C: HELEN
D: The park? Don't be stupid Dana.
C: LESLIE
D: Jeez, take it easy.
C: HELEN
D: Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying.
C: MEGAN
D: Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always hides in Mexico.
C: BECCA
D: I don't think she'd leave the country. Maybe she went to the reservoir.
C: HELEN
D: Why would she go to the reservoir? Its just a big tank of water.
C: DANA
D: Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning walk there. It's the next best thing to a lake.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh my God! I think I know where she is.
S: INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE.
N: The girls drive on a dark road.
C: LESLIE
D: How much further?
C: ANNIE
D: We're almost there.
C: BECCA
D: I'm think I'm getting carsick.
C: HELEN
D: Is that supposed to be a dig on my driving?
C: DANA
D: Well you do speed up and slow down a lot.
C: HELEN
D: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't take a stunt driving course in Renegade missions.
C: BECCA
D: Why do you always have to be so condescending?
C: LESLIE
D: Yeah, its getting really old.
C: HELEN
D: I was being funny!
C: DANA
D: Well it came out a little mean Helen.
C: HELEN
D: Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless.
C: BECCA
D: What was that?
C: DANA
D: Did we hit something!?
C: HELEN
D: Was it a person?
C: ANNIE
D: Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car.
C: BECCA/DANA
D: No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch dark out.
C: HELEN
D: Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.
C: LESLIE
D: You don't call 911 for a flat tire! A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit. The girls SCREAM!
C: ANNIE
D: Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards on. Helen puts them on.
C: LESLIE
D: I'm calling AAA.
C: BECCA
D: I'm calling Kevin!
C: ANNIE
D: Helen, do you have a jack?
C: HELEN
D: Probably?!
C: DANA
D: What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal?
C: ANNIE
D: Dana calm down.
C: LESLIE
D: Shit! I don't have any service.
C: BECCA
D: Me neither!
C: DANA
D: Oh my God! We're gonna die... Annie has had enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk, lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade] She goes up to the window.
S: INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. CONTINUOUS.
C: ANNIE
D: Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do. Annie puts the jack under car.
C: LESLIE
D: So, how can I help?
C: ANNIE
D: Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she's doing! The car is raising.
C: ANNIE
D: Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side. Dana and Becca stand with Helen.
E: CONT'D
C: DANA
D: That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire.
C: BECCA
D: I know. I can't believe she's doing it. Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone.
C: HELEN
D: Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.
C: DANA
D: So what are you doing now?
C: ANNIE
D: I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off.
C: BECCA
D: How does that little thing lift the whole car?
C: MEGAN
D: It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.
C: LESLIE
D: How do you know this stuff?
C: MEGAN
D: I like cars. There's a real artistry to them.
C: HELEN
D: Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night.
C: DANA
D: Annie is doing the best she can Helen. So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait.
E: quickly
N: Everyone's speechless.
C: HELEN
D: Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen.
C: DANA
D: I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up!!!?? Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.
C: DANA
D: Lillian probably left because of you anyway.
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: What!?
C: DANA
D: You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said âThat's not me.â And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time! Annie was right.
C: MEGAN
D: Yeah! Helen glares at Megan.
C: HELEN
D: What are you talking about? The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister. Weirdo.
C: MEGAN
D: I'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants. We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.
C: HELEN
D: Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
N: Everyone looks at Annie.
C: LESLIE
D: I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over. The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at- shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: Hey it's pretty late. What are you ladies doing? Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets behind the car.
C: ANNIE
D: Just changing the tire.
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: You guys need some man hands for that?
C: ANNIE
D: Nope I think we got it. But thank you. He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: Look, if you guys get tired, I live right up that hill. You ladies can just leave your car here, come on up and let us all lay down together. He starts to walk toward them. The girls are scared. Annie gives Megan a look. Megan tries to distract him.
C: MEGAN
D: Hey! Are those snowflake rims? The guy looks at Megan.
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: Yeah, found âem in a junk yard. Restored âem myself.
C: MEGAN
D: I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: Well, well. Someone knows her cars.
C: MEGAN
D: I'm in the Firebird club.
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: You don't say. I never met a lady in the FBC before. He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it.
C: MEGAN
D: You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton? Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They talk in a loud whisper.
C: BECCA
D: What's happening? What's happening?
C: DANA
D: I can hear animals.
C: BECCA
D: Be quiet! The guy is moving closer to Megan.
C: MEGAN
D: Remember Smokey and the Bandit?
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: It's my favorite movie. âGive me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it quick . I'm in a goddamn hurry.â He leans into her.
C: MEGAN
D: Why don't you show me what's under the hood? Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.
C: LESLIE
D: How's it comin'?
C: ANNIE
D: Almost there. The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He puts his hands on her ass.
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: You wanna get in the backseat?
C: MEGAN
D: Uh... He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.
C: MEGAN
D: Hey take it easy!
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: Hey what about me? He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by Helen. He falls.
E: O.S.
C: DANA
D: Oh my God!! Annie is frantically releasing the jack.
C: ANNIE
D: OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan, Helen let's go! All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie is finishing.
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: Hey you!
C: HELEN
D: Annie get in!
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: I'm gonna get you bitches!! He is coming towards Annie! She turns towards him with the jack.
C: ANNIE
D: Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out...your fucking..face!
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: Whoa, whoa. Alright. Alright. I'm leaving.
C: ANNIE
D: Get out!
C: TRANS AM MAN
D: I am! I live up the hill though if you change your mind. Annie backs up and jumps in the car. Helen peels away. The girls drive away fast.
C: CONTINUOUS
D: The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips.
C: LESLIE
D: Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up against you. That was a pretty gutsy move.
C: MEGAN
D: Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack.
C: ANNIE
D: Helen hit him over the head with a tree. They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.
C: ANNIE
D: There it is, turn left up here. Go down the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway. It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met.
E: CONT'D
C: LESLIE
D: God I haven't been here in forever.
C: ANNIE
D: The house is right up here. They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.
C: HELEN
D: Her car's not here.
C: DANA
D: Doesn't look like any lights are on.
C: BECCA
D: She's not here. Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.
C: ANNIE
D: I thought she'd be here. I really thought she'd be here. I'm sorry.
C: DANA
D: Annie, it's ok.
C: ANNIE
D: No, it's not. I don't know what happened. I messed everything up. Lillia's not even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening. Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent.
C: HELEN
D: Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you.. I don't have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there. And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I....I've never been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because... I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else. And I'm just good at throwing parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that.
C: ANNIE
D: Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled by the flash.
C: HELEN
D: I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm sorry that when I left the shower I told your neighbors you were shooting a porn.
C: HELEN
D: Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, well, sorry.
C: HELEN
D: I deserved it.
C: ANNIE
D: I must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events.
C: HELEN
D: Well, I'm really rich. They smile.
C: ANNIE
D: It is getting pretty late.
C: DANA
D: What should we do about Lillian?
C: ANNIE
D: She'll come home when she's ready.
S: INT. ANNIE HALLWAY. LATE THAT NIGHT (EARLY AM]
N: Annie enters exhausted to find Lillian sitting against her door. Annie walks up and slides down to sit next to her. After a minute.
C: ANNIE
D: You okay?
C: LILLIAN
D: Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry.
C: ANNIE
D: It's okay. I really am sorry.
C: LILLIAN
D: I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to turn out like this. I got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect.
C: ANNIE
D: Well its easy to get caught up.
C: LILLIAN
D: And it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all talked and everythings cool.
C: HELEN
D: Really?!
C: ANNIE
D: Yup, Helen and I are best friends now. We're going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow.
C: LILLIAN
D: She's really not so bad.
C: ANNIE
D: I know.
C: LILLIAN
D: I just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and Dougie. And now, it's become this thing I never wanted. I did want simple. I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to play all those stupid wedding songs.
C: ANNIE
D: It's not too late to have those things.
C: LILLIAN
D: I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you were going through too. Annie is clearly sad.
C: ANNIE
D: It's fine. I just feel really lost right
C: NOW AND--
D: Lillian hugs her.
C: LILLIAN
D: Nothing's going to change.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh God dont say that.
C: LILLIAN
D: I mean between you and me.
C: ANNIE
D: You want to come in? Steve's home. This could be your last chance as a single woman.
C: LILLIAN
D: Ooooo...
S: EXT HIGHWAY. VERY EARLY NEXT MORNING
N: The small paper bag sits on the side of the road. Cop car pulls up. This is Rhodes' spot, we've seen before. He gets out and walks over to it, confused. He picks it up and it says, âOfficer Rhodesâ. He's a little weary but opens it and pulls out a note. âI hear you like moonpies.â He looks in the bag and smiles.
S: EXT. WEDDING RECEPTION. BELMONT CLUB. DUSK.

S: EXT. RECEPTION. LATER
N: Annie and Lillian walking out of the reception.
C: LILLIAN
D: So when does school start?
C: ANNIE
D: A week. I'm scared. I'm gonna be the oldest one there.
C: LILLIAN
D: So what? Now you can have an affair with your teacher and it won't be gross. They walk down the steps.
C: LILLIAN
D: Thanks for everything today. Yo've been the best Maid of Honor ever.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNIE
D: Really?
C: LILLIAN
D: MMM. No. That's not true at all. You were pretty terrible. Today you were good. Annie sees the hotel shuttle.
E: kidding
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel.
C: LILLIAN
D: You're always gonna be my best friend. They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.
C: ANNIE
D: I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs. Price!
N: Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside. Annie runs towards the shuttle. She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She JUST missed it.
C: ANNIE
D: Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course. The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on the other side of it.
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: Need a ride ma'am? It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.
E: O.C.
C: ANNIE
D: How did you know I was here?
C: RHODES
D: It was really complicated. I remembered the name of this place, I called them up, told them I was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop] Annie smiles.
C: ANNIE
D: Wow. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
C: ANNIE
D: So, did you get the moonpies?
E: CONT'D
C: RHODES
D: Yes I did.
C: ANNIE
D: Did you like' em?
C: RHODES
D: Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
C: ANNIE
D: Ooo, I didn't think about that.
C: RHODES
D: You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something. Tupperware would've worked but then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm gonna kiss you right now so... He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about to kiss. Rhodes stops.
C: RHODES
D: I didn't want to miss my chance again.
E: CONT'D
N: ANNIE (SMILING) Me neither. They MAKE OUT. The end.
C: ALT ENDING
D: Annie is walking back to her hotel. A cop car pulls up next to her.
C: RHODES
D: Need a ride ma'am? She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her.
E: O.C.
C: ANNIE
D: How did you know I was here?
C: RHODES
D: I'm a cop. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
C: ANNIE
D: So, did you get the moonpies?
C: RHODES
D: Yes I did.
C: ANNIE
D: Did you like' em?
C: RHODES
D: Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
C: ANNIE
D: Ooo, I didn't think about that.
C: RHODES
D: The real reason I came here today is that I have something that belongs to you. He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles. He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets
N: in. They drive off into the sunset.
