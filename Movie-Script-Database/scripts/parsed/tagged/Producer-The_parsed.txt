E: to himself
N: SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.
C: LITTLE OLD LADY
D: I shall count the minutes.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Goodbye, my angel ... My angel! Hey, touch me ... wait! Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
E: calling after her
N: WE HEAR A MOUNTING CLATTER OF FOOTSTEPS AS THE LITTLE OLD LADY FLIES BACK UP THE STAIRS.
C: LITTLE OLD LADY
D: Yes???
E: eagerly
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me the check. Can't produce a play without money, ha, ha, ha.
N: CUT TO BLOOM. ONCE MORE HE STEALS A GLANCE AT THE STRANGER HIDDEN IN THE SECOND DOORWAY. ONCE AGAIN THE MAN GESTURES FOR HIM TO BE SILENT. CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY.
C: LITTLE OLD LADY
D: Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
E: opening her handbag and reaching inside
N: SHE TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND HANDS IT TO HIM.
C: LITTLE OLD LADY
D: I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
N: BIALYSTOCK TAKES CHECK AND READS IT.
C: LITTLE OLD LADY
D: Is it all right? I made it out to cash. You didn't tell me the name of the play.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Oh, it's fine. Fine. Good. Good. Bye. Bye.
C: LITTLE OLD LADY
D: Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
N: SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.
C: LITTLE OLD LADY
D: Ta. Ta.
E: descending
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Ta. Ta.
E: waving check at her
N: THE MAN, WHO HAS BEEN LURKING IN THE SECOND DOORWAY, SUDDENLY SPRINGS INTO ACTION. HE DARTS FORWARD AND QUICKLY TAKES THE CHECK OUT OF BIALYSTOCK'S HAND.
C: THE MAN
D: He who signs a lease, must pay rent.
E: LANDLORD
N: HE SHOVES THE CHECK INTO HIS POCKET AND STARTS DOWN THE STAIRS.
C: LANDLORD
D: That's the law.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Murderer! Thief! How can you take the last penny out of a man's pocket?
C: LANDLORD
D: I have to ... I'm a landlord!
E: turns back, shrugs
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Oh Lord, hear my plea. Destroy him. He maketh a blight on the land.
E: shouting to heaven
N: CUT TO LANDLORD ON THE WAY DOWN.
C: LANDLORD
D: Don't pay attention. He's crazy.
E: to the Lord
N: CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK. HE TURNS TO RE-ENTER HIS OFFICE.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Nnnnn. That hurt. I'll have to make another call.
E: biting his knuckle he sighs
N: HE STARTS IN AND STOPS. HE NOTICES BLOOM.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Have you been there all this time?
E: to Bloom, quietly
N: BLOOM NODS.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: And did you see and hear everything?
N: BLOOM NODS.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Then what do you have to say for yourself?
C: BLOOM
D: Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Who are you? What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don't you speak?
E: shouts
C: BLOOM
D: Scared. Can't talk.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: All right. Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
C: BLOOM
D: I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
E: breathes deeply. Words tumble from his mouth as he exhales he has run out of breath
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: "Caught you with the old lady." Come in, Mr. Tact.
N: CUT TO OFFICE. THEY ENTER. BLOOM ENTERS TIMOROUSLY. HE DOESN'T KNOW QUITE WHERE TO GO. HE LOOKS TO BIALYSTOCK FOR GUIDANCE. BIALYSTOCK STUDIES BLOOM CURIOUSLY FROM HEAD TO TOE.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: So you're an accountant, eh?
C: BLOOM
D: Yes sir.
E: timidly
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Then account for yourself! Do you believe in God? Do you believe in gold? Why are you looking up old lady's dresses? Bit of a pervert, eh?
N: BLOOM, WHO HAS BEEN QUAKING UNDER THE ASSAULT, REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE TATTERED CORNER OF AN OLD BLUE BABY BLANKET. HE TWISTS THE BLUE BLANKET NERVOUSLY IN HIS HANDS.
C: BLOOM
D: Sir, I ...
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Never mind. Never mind. Do the books. They're in that desk over there. Top drawer.
N: BLOOM DUTIFULLY GOES TO DESK. OPENS TOP DRAWER AND BEGINS REMOVING BOOKS.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: How dare you condemn me without knowing all the facts.
C: BLOOM
D: But sir, I'm not condem ...
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Shut up. I'm having a rhetorical conversation. How humiliating. Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
E: to himself
N: BIALYSTOCK SUDDENLY WHEELS AND SHOUTS AT BLOOM.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You know who I used to be? Max Bialystock! The King of Broadway! Six shows running at once. Lunch at Delmonico's. Two hundred dollar suits. Look at me. Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt!
N: HE RIPS THE BELT OFF AND HOLDS IT IN THE AIR.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I used to have thousands of investors begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock production.
N: HE PICKS UP THE PICTURE ON DESK ('HOLD ME, TOUCH ME') TAKES IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR PICTURES.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Look at my investors now. Voila! Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock's office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery.
E: gestures at pictures
N: HE PUTS PICTURE BACK IN ITS PLACE. LOOKS TOWARD BLOOM. CUT TO BLOOM. HE IS OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED BY THE GREAT MAN'S DILEMMA.
T: CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect. One ... Two ...
N: CUT TO BLOOM. HE IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION.
T: CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Do the books! Do the books!
N: CUT TO BLOOM. HE IS GREATLY RELIEVED.
C: BLOOM
D: Yes, sir. Thank you.
E: sighing
N: HE PLUNGES INTO HIS WORK. CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. HE GOES TO WINDOW, LOOKS OUT.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
E: to himself
N: HE WIPES WINDOW WITH HIS CUFF. LOOKS AT WINDOW. NO GOOD. LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF. GRIMACES. FROM HIS DESK HE TAKES THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES IT AGAINST THE WINDOW. HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE. HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING. BLOOM IS WATCHING. THEIR EYES MEET. BLOOM'S EYES RETREAT. BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW DOWN INTO THE STREET.
S: CAMERA: SHOT OF STREET. BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW. A
N: WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Look at that. A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
E: voice over as camera follows Rolls
C: BLOOM
D: Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
E: off screen
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention. Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
N: BLOOM IS WOUNDED.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I have hurt your feelings.
N: BLOOM NODS.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Good, what is it?
C: BLOOM
D: Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.
E: looking at his watch
C: BLOOM
D: Well, sir, it seems ...
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry. Hurry.
E: interrupting
C: BLOOM
D: In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
E: speedily
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
E: interrupting
N: IN HIS ANXIETY, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET TAKES OUT THE OLD BLUE BLANKET AND NERVOUSLY STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH IT.
C: BLOOM
D: Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function under these conditions.
N: BIALYSTOCK CURIOUSLY EYES THE BLANKET.
C: BLOOM
D: You're making me extremely nervous.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What is that? A handkerchief?
N: BLOOM QUICKLY BEGINS TO PUT AWAY HIS BLUE BLANKET.
C: BLOOM
D: It's nothing ... nothing.
N: QUICK AS A FLASH, BIALYSTOCK REACHES OVER AND SNATCHES IT OUT OF BLOOM'S HAND.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: If it's nothing, why can't I see it?
N: BLOOM LEAPS UP IN HOT PURSUIT OF HIS BLANKET.
C: BLOOM
D: My blanket. Give me my blue blanket.
E: shrieking in panic
N: BIALYSTOCK, TAKEN ABACK, HURRIEDLY GIVES THE BLANKET BACK TO BLOOM.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Here, don't panic.
C: BLOOM
D: I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket. It's not important. It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
E: clutching his blanket
N: HE KISSES IT AND SHOVES IT INTO HIS POCKET.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: They come here. They all come here. How do they find me?
E: to himself
C: BLOOM
D: Mr. Bialystock ...
E: recovering his dignity
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
C: BLOOM
D: This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
N: BIALYSTOCK MOVES AROUND THE DESK TO EXAMINE THE LEDGER.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Where? What?
C: BLOOM
D: According to the backer's list you raised $60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand. There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop. What difference does it make?
C: BLOOM
D: It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Why should they find out? It's only two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around. You can do it. You're an accountant. The word 'count' is part of your title.
C: BLOOM
D: But that's cheating!
E: aghast
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning. Other men sail through life. Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom, I'm going under. I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure. Bloom, I'm reaching out to you. Don't send me to jail. Help! Help!
N: DURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT ACROSS HIS CHEEK.
C: BLOOM
D: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Help!
E: faintly
C: BLOOM
D: All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
C: BLOOM
D: Oh, it's all right ... wha?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
C: BLOOM
D: Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much. I'm sure I can hide it somewhere. After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
E: pouring over the accounts
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little nap. Wake me if there's a fire.
E: crossing to couch
N: HE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH. CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.
C: BLOOM
D: Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
N: CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES. HE COMES TO THE END AND IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW. BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM. HE COMPARES PAGES.
C: BLOOM
D: Heh, heh, heh, amazing. It's absolutely amazing. But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
E: musing to himself
N: QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE. HIS EYES POP OPEN.
T: CUT BACK TO BLOOM.
C: BLOOM
D: Yes. Yes. It's quite possible. If he were certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune.
N: CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM. HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS. HE MOVES TO BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR MORE INFORMATION. BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Yes???
N: BLOOM LOOKS UP. HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO CLOSE TO HIS OWN.
C: BLOOM
D: Yes, what?
E: at a loss
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What you were saying. Keep talking.
C: BLOOM
D: What was I saying?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
C: BLOOM
D: Yes, it's quite possible.
E: smiling
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
N: BLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES BIALYSTOCK. HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A STUDENT.
C: BLOOM
D: It's simply a matter of creative accounting. Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Assume away!
C: BLOOM
D: Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really need.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What do you mean?
C: BLOOM
D: You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What did I do?
C: BLOOM
D: You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: So what? What did it get me? I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
C: BLOOM
D: Ahhhhhh! But that's where you made your error. You didn't go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
C: BLOOM
D: Exactly. And how long did it run?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: One night.
C: BLOOM
D: See? You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: But what if the play was a hit?
C: BLOOM
D: Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
C: BLOOM
D: What scheme?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
C: BLOOM
D: Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. It's just a thought.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
N: BIALYSTOCK STARTS MOVING IN ON BLOOM.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Don't you see, Bloom. Darling, Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so simple. Step one: We find the worst play in the world -- a sure flop. Step two: I raise a million dollars -- there's a lot of little old ladies in this world. Step three: You go back to work on the books. Phoney lists of backers -- one for the government, one for us. You can do it, Bloom, you're a wizard.
E: MORE
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Step four: We open on Broadway and before you can say 'step five' we close on Broadway. Step six: We take our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero.
E: CONT'D
N: BIALYSTOCK GRABS BLOOM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGINS TO LEAD HIM IN A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: "Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo, myo, meo ... "
E: sings
C: BLOOM
D: Mr. Bialystock. No. Wait. Please. You're holding me too tight. I'm an honest man. You don't understand.
E: afraid of the scheme, afraid of the dance, afraid of Bialystock
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
E: leading Bloom as he talks
N: AT THIS POINT, BIALYSTOCK SWEEPS BLOOM INTO AN ELABORATE DIP.
C: BLOOM
D: Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
E: the back of his head practically touching the floor
N: BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS FISTS TO THE HEAVENS IN DESPAIR. BLOOM, EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT, GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.

D: OOOOOHH! I WANT THAT MONEY!
N: CAMERA ON BLOOM AS HE LIES STRICKEN ON THE FLOOR.
C: BLOOM
D: Oh, I fell on my keys. I've got to get out of here.
E: to himself he shifts slightly to make himself more comfortable
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar. Don't you ever want to become a butterfly? Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
E: angrily hovering over Bloom
N: BIALYSTOCK FLAPS HIS ARMS LIKE A HUGE PREDATORY BIRD.
C: BLOOM
D: You're going to jump on me.
E: his eyes widened in terror
N: BIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY.
C: BLOOM
D: You're going to jump on me. I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What???
E: nonplussed
C: BLOOM
D: Poppea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me.
E: by now he is shrieking
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I'm not going to jump on you!
E: shouting and jumping up and down next to Bloom
C: BLOOM
D: Aaaaaaaaaa!
E: rolling away in terror
C: BIALYSTOCK

C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What are you afraid of? I'm not going to hurt you! What's the matter with you?
C: BLOOM
D: I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. I'm hysterical. I can't stop. When I get like this, I can't stop. I'm hysterical.
N: BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK. PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE.
C: BLOOM
D: I'm wet! I'm wet! I'm hysterical and I'm wet!
N: BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS, SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.
C: BLOOM
D: I'm in pain! And I'm wet! And I'm still hysterical!
E: holding his face
N: BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN.
C: BLOOM
D: No! No! Don't hit. It doesn't help. It only increases my sense of danger.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What can I do? What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
C: BLOOM
D: Go away from me. You frighten me. Sit over there.
E: he indicates the sofa
N: BIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Okay. I'm way over here. Is that better?
E: exasperated
C: BLOOM
D: It's a little better, but you still look angry.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: How's this?
E: he smiles sweetly
C: BLOOM
D: Good. Good. That's nice. That's very nice. I think I'm coming out of it now. Yes. Yes. I'm definitely coming out of it. Thank you for smiling. It helped a great deal.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you." Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight jacket. Feeling better?
E: for want of something sensible to himself to Bloom
C: BLOOM
D: Much, thank you. But I am a little lightheaded. Maybe I should eat something. Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: They certainly do. They certainly do. Come, let me take you to lunch.
C: BLOOM
D: That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy. I lowered your blood sugar, but least I could do is raise it a little.
E: interrupting
N: BLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: And I promise you faithfully, I won't discuss that silly scheme to make a million dollars anymore.
N: BIALYSTOCK DONS HIS CAPE AND "BELASCO" HAT. FROM A RACK HE SELECTS A GOLD-TOPPED WALKING STICK. HE GOES TO DOOR, OPENS IT, AND WITH A GRAND FLOURISH, MOTIONS BLOOM TO PRECEDE HIM.

C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Murray, I'm going to lunch. I took two dollars.
C: MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
D: Okay, Bialy, that makes six eighty you owe me.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I know. Don't worry. You'll get it. You'll get it.
C: MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
D: Well, don't forget about it. I need it. Nobody understands. I'm competing with giants. The Greater New York Fund. The March of Dimes. The Community Chest. They're driving me out of business.
E: tapping his way along
N: BLOOM COMES DASHING BACK WITH HAT IN HAND.
C: BLOOM
D: I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
E: out of breath
N: HE PROFFERS HAT TO BIALYSTOCK. BIALYSTOCK TAKES IT.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Thank you, Leo. And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max. It's only people I really like.
C: BLOOM
D: Okay ... Max! And you can call me Leo.
E: trying it on
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I already have. Come on.
C: BLOOM
D: Oh.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Where would you like to eat?
C: BLOOM
D: Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What do you think, Max?
N: BIALYSTOCK QUIETLY WINCES AT THE SURFEIT OF MAX.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day. Why waste it indoors. I've got it! Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
C: BLOOM
D: Coney Island??
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What's the matter, Leo? Don't you like Coney Island?
C: BLOOM
D: I ... I love it. I haven't been there since I was a kid. But it's nearly two o'clock. I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
C: BIALYSTOCK

C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job. Leading a grey little life.
E: sensing victory, he marshals his forces for the final assault
C: BLOOM
D: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm a nothing. I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than. Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share? I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!

N: CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. HE IS STANDING. AT HIS FEET LIES A SCRIPT. HE DANCES AROUND IT, HIS ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HIS CHEST.

E: looking up he turns to the pigeons
N: HE OPENS THE CAGES AND SETS THE BIRDS FREE.

E: astonished by the question
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: No kidding?
C: LIEBKIND
D: Oh, sure. I used to take him his hot milk and his opium. Achhh, those were the days. Vat good times ve had. Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing. You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Really, I never dreamed ...
C: LIEBKIND
D: That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies. But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they? Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie! Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi. He would say Narzis, Narzis. Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis. But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
E: flies into an indignant rage he gestures V for victory

N: LIEBKIND SIGNS. "THE RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES" REACHES ITS ZENITH. IT ECHOES THROUGH THE ROOM AS WE FADE OUT. FADE IN ON BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY WALK UP STREET AWAY FROM TENEMENT. IT IS LATE AFTERNOON. THEY ARE BOTH WEARING SWASTIKA ARM BANDS.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered. What's the matter with you?
E: triumphantly whacking the contract with the back of his hand he notices Bloom's dour expression
C: BLOOM

C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Okay, take it off, take it off.
E: placating him
N: THEY TAKE OFF THEIR ARM BANDS AND TOSS THEM INTO A LITTER BASKET. BIALYSTOCK SPOTS A PASSING TAXI. HE WHISTLES. IT STOPS.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: The Blue Gypsy.
E: to cab driver as he opens door
C: BLOOM
D: Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?!
E: about to enter cab with Bialystock
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: We are not going to The Blue Gypsy. I am going to The Blue Gypsy.
E: stopping Bloom from entering cab
N: BIALYSTOCK GETS INTO CAB AND SLAMS THE DOOR. HE CONTINUES SPEAKING TO BLOOM THROUGH THE WINDOW.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I have a rendez-vous with a lady of some means. You see dear Bloom, phase one is complete, the play is ours. We are now entering phase two -- the raising of the money. In the days to come, you will see very little of me, for Bialystock is launching himself into little- old-lady-land. Avanti!
E: to cab driver
N: THE CAB SPEEDS AWAY. SWISH PAN CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LITTLE OLD LADY #3. IN HER HAND SHE HOLDS A BUBBLING GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE. SHE RAISES IT TO BIALYSTOCK. PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY. THEY ARE SEATED IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A LITTLE VIENNESE CAFE. LITTLE OLD LADY #3 Here's to the success of your new play. BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS GLASS.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Our play, my love.
N: HE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST. IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY. THE TOAST IS A FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS VEST AND TROUSERS. LITTLE OLD LADY #3 Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Think nothing of it, my dear. A mere trifle. A mere trifle. Did you bring your checkbook?
N: LITTLE OLD LADY #3 It's right here in my purse and I made it out just as you told me -- to cash. That's a funny name for a play.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Think nothing of it.
N: SHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK. AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE. THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED. BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE OLD LADY CLUTCH HER HEART. BIALYSTOCK IS VERY UNHAPPY. HE QUIETLY BRINGS HIS FOOT FROM BENEATH THE TABLE AND PLACES IT DIRECTLY OVER THE FOOT OF THE VIOLINIST. CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S FOOT. BIALYSTOCK PROCEEDS TO CRUSH VIOLINIST'S FOOT. CUT TO VIOLINIST'S FACE. SOMEHOW IT CONVEYS TO US ALL THE MISERY AND PAIN OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. WITH EYES CROSSED BY GRIEF, HE LIMPS TO ANOTHER TABLE. BIALYSTOCK QUICKLY REACHES OUT AND SNATCHES THE CHECK. SWISH PAN CUT TO HANSOM CAB THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH CENTRAL PARK. NIGHT.

D: Clear the road! Clear the road!
N: LITTLE OLD LADY #5 (clutching Bialystock fiercely) Go, Bialy, baby, go! SWISH PAN CUT TO POSH PARK AVENUE APARTMENT. NIGHT. A PRIVATE CONCERN IS IN PROGRESS.

SEATED IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AROUND THE PIANO ON VARIOUS PIECES OF DELICATE EMPIRE FURNITURE IS AN AUSTERE GROUP OF ELDERLY DIGNIFIED PATRONS OF THE ARTS. SUDDENLY AN OLD LADY'S SHRIEK RENDS THE AIR. EVERYONE'S HEAD TURNS. LITTLE OLD LADY #6 (slightly flustered) Go on with the concert! Go on with the concert! It's nothing. Nothing. BIALYSTOCK STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD. LITTLE OLD LADY #6 (to Bialystock, smiling) You dirty man. SWISH PAN CUT TO NEW YORK STREET. OLD FASHIONED LIMOUSINE PULLS INTO VIEW. THE WINDOW SHADES ARE DRAWN. AS IT PASSES, WE DETECT STRANGE SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE INTERIOR. LITTLE OLD LADY #7 (off camera) Tee hee, ha ha ha, ho ho, ooo, ooo, teehee hee.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Heh, heh, heh. Hah, hah, hah.
E: off camera, simultaneously
N: THE CAR DRIVES OUT OF FRAME. SWISH PAN CUT TO SCULPTOR'S ATELIER. DAY. AN ANCIENT LITTLE OLD LADY WEARING A SCULPTOR'S SMOCK IS FEEBLY CHIPPING AWAY WITH CHISEL AND HAMMER AT A HUGE SQUARE BLOCK OF MARBLE. SHE MAKES NOT A SCRATCH ON IT. CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, HER SUBJECT, STANDING NUDE, EXCEPT FOR LOIN CLOTH, HOLDING UP AN ENORMOUS GLOBE. HE IS OBVIOUSLY ATLAS. LITTLE OLD LADY #8 (stepping back to admire her work) Well, Bialy, how's it coming?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: It's beautiful, Alma, beautiful. Oi.
E: to the heavens
N: SWISH PAN CUT TO LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. BIALYSTOCK, DRESSED AS A TURKISH SLAVE, IS ASLEEP ON THE SOFA. THE ROOM HAS BEEN DONE IN A BYZANTINE DECOR. THE STRAINS OF SCHEHERAZADE SOFTLY FILL THE ROOM. SUDDENLY A WHIP COMES FLASHING INTO THE FRAME AND WHACKS AGAINST THE TORSO OF THE SLEEPING BIALYSTOCK. SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL 'HOLD ME, TOUCH ME' WIELDING THE WHIP. SHE IS DRESSED IN AN 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' COSTUME.
C: HOLD ME, TOUCH ME
D: Dance! Dance, slave!

D: What are you doing?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I'm going to buy a toy. I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
C: BLOOM
D: A toy?
E: quizzically
N: DISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP, FACE OF A GORGEOUS BLONDE, ULLA. DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF HER. SHE IS INCREDIBLY WELL-ENDOWED. CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. THEIR EYES GLUED TO HER FORM.
C: BLOOM
D: That's a toy?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Yes. She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
N: BLOOM STARES AT HIM.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence. She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
N: QUICKLY PAN POSH NEW WALL-PAPER, FURNISHINGS, ETC.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
C: ULLA
D: Got dag pa dig.
C: BLOOM

N: ULLA LEAVES.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Nice girl.
C: BLOOM
D: Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending. I mean these offices and everything.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Why? Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
C: BLOOM
D: But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back. It would look better in court.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Stop talking like that, you white mouse! Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.

N: BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM REMOVE THEIR SHOES.
C: CARMEN

E: to Bloom indicating a rack of slippers to Bialystock, studying his mish mash attire
N: CARMEN LEADS THE WAY. BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCUFF AFTER HIM. WE FOLLOW THEM DOWN A NARROW CORRIDOR LINED WITH EXAMPLES OF CLASSIC GREEK SCULPTURE -- EACH ONE DEPICTING NUDE MALES IN VARIOUS POSES. INT: ELEVATOR. CUT TO ROGER DE BRIS' BOUDOIR SITTING ROOM. IT IS ELEGANTLY FEMININE. CHAISE LOUNGE, ANTIQUE MIRRORS, LOUIS XVI ARMOIRE AND DRESSING TABLE.

D: Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I presume. Ha, ha, ha, forgive the pun.
C: BLOOM
D: What pun?
E: to Bialystock
C: BIALYSTOCK

D: Max! He's wearing a dress.
E: shocked, whispers his mouth remains open
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Shhhhhh.
C: DE BRIS
D: I think it's a very important play. I, for one, never realized that the Third Reich meant Germany. I mean it's drenched with historical goodies like that.
E: continuing
N: DE BRIS IS SUDDENLY AWARE OF BLOOM'S EXPRESSION. (BLOOM'S MOUTH IS STILL AGAPE.)
C: DE BRIS
D: Oh, dear, you're staring at my dress. I should explain. I'm going to the Choreographer's Ball tonight. There's a prize for the best costume.
C: CARMEN
D: We always win.
E: smugly
C: DE BRIS
D: I'm not so sure about tonight. I'm supposed to be the Grand Duchess -- I think I look more like Tugboat Annie. What do you think?
E: looking in the mirror
N: HE PARADES BACK AND FORTH, EXECUTING SHARP TURNS LIKE A MODEL AT A FASHION SHOW.
C: DE BRIS
D: No be cruel. Be brutal. Be brutal. Because heaven knows they will. Well, what do you think, Mr. Bloom?

D: Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
E: very embarrassed
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: It's gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color. It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
E: jumping in
C: DE BRIS
D: Do you really think it brings out my eyes?
E: his eyes flashing flirtatiously
C: CARMEN
D: We can't tell a thing without your wig. As far as I'm concerned, you're only half-dressed.
E: irritated
C: DE BRIS
D: Ummmm. Well, if you're so worried about the wig, get it, o' wicked witch of the west.
N: CARMEN TURNS IN A HUFF AND LEAVES TO GET THE WIG. DE BRIS REACHES INTO CUT CRYSTAL CIGARETTE BOX, TAKES CIGARETTE, TAPS IT, AND HOLDS IT FOR A LIGHT.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Quick, light his cigarette. He likes you.
E: in a whisper to Bloom
N: BLOOM NERVOUSLY REACHES FOR A BOOK OF MATCHES, RIPS ONE OUT AND STRIKES IT. IT DOESN'T LIGHT. HE TRIES ANOTHER AND ANOTHER. ONE FINALLY CATCHES FIRE. HE TRIES TO HOLD IT STEADY, BUT HE IS TOO NERVOUS. DE BRIS FIRMLY PLACES HIS HAND OVER BLOOM'S TO STEADY THE FLAME.
C: DE BRIS
D: Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?
N: HE LIGHTS THE CIGARETTE BUT CONTINUES TO HOLD BLOOM'S HAND.

N: DE BRIS DROPS BLOOM'S HAND AND TURNS ON CARMEN.
C: DE BRIS
D: How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
C: DE BRIS
D: Please, please, that's what we're here for. Be careful, that hurt.
E: to Carmen, who is adjusting the wig
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger. Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
C: DE BRIS
D: Yes. Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns. Two-three-kick-turn! Turn- turn-kick-turn! It's enough to make you throw up! At last a chance to do straight drama! To deal with conflict, with inner truth. Roger De Bris presents history. Of course, I think we should add a little music. That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war. It's too depressing. We'll have to put something in there. Aaahghhh! I see it! A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn! Turn-turn- kick-turn!
E: gripped by his vision
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: That's genius. That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
C: DE BRIS
D: Wait a minute. This is a very big decision. It might effect the course of my entire life. I'll have to think about it. I'll do it.
E: in one rush
N: DE BRIS EXTENDS HIS HAND. BIALYSTOCK SHAKES IT.

C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Got to think... Got to think... Got to think... Got to think... Got to think...
E: dazed
N: CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD. HIS EYES ARE GLAZED WITH SHOCK. HE STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH HIS LITTLE BLUE BLANKET.

N: THEY TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS LIKE TWO FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOYS AND CAUTIOUSLY WALK IN. CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY ENTER. THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS MEEKLY, LIKE TWO LAMBS AWAITING THE SLAUGHTER. CUT TO STAGE. HITLER HAS OBVIOUSLY CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR. THE FUHRER IS SURROUNDED BY HIS GENERAL STAFF.
C: GENERAL

N: THE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD. FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS LIEBKIND. HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE.
C: LIEBKIND
D: I am the author of this play. You are the victims of a hoax. These are not my words. The Fuhrer never said baby. The Fuhrer was sweet, the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was good.

MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND. IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS. SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE. THE DOOR FLIES OPEN. THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER. ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS.

E: defensively
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
C: BLOOM
D: I'm turning myself in. It's the only way. I'm going to cooperate with the authorities. They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior. And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library. So long.
E: with hysterical conviction
N: HE TURNS THE KNOB. THE DOOR IS LOCKED. HE FIDDLES WITH THE CATCH. TOO LATE! BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH. HE BLOCKS THE DOOR.

N: OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL. AS THE CAMERA MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN. CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND. BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP. LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK LOOSE FROM WALL. BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP. BRICK COMES LOOSE.

C: LIEBKIND
D: Vait a minute. Vait a minute. Male to male? Male to female? Female to male? Female to female? Vait a minute. In people, male to female. But electricity is strange. It's male to male.

N: HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE. WHOOSH! IT IGNITES. THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION. LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH. HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS IT OUT.

C: BIALYSTOCK
D: We assumed that.
N: LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND SHOWS THEM A ROLL OF FUSE.
C: LIEBKIND
D: Here. You see. This is the slow fuse. It is much wider. It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
C: LIEBKIND
D: Yes. Amazing isn't it?
N: BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS CANE AND SMASHES LIEBKIND ON THE HELMET. BONNNG.

C: BIALYSTOCK
D: The coast is clear!
C: LIEBKIND
D: Good. Get down.
N: BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS. LIEBKIND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR. HIS EYES SUDDENLY GLISTEN WITH TEARS.
C: LIEBKIND
D: Goodbye, my foolish fancy. Goodbye, my misbegotten child. Goodbye, my tortured testament of twisted truths.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Do it! Do it!
N: LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE. HE STARTS AND STOPS.
C: LIEBKIND
D: I can't. I can't do it. It's a demon. It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
N: HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY. BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN. HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION. NOTHING HAPPENS. AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY.
C: BIALYSTOCK
D: Nothing.
E: quizzically
N: LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES DETONATOR.
C: LIEBKIND
D: Here is gut... of course, of course. In electricity, it's always male to female. But with people, it's not always so. Come ve must go back.
