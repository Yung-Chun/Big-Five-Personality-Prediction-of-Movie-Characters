D: In the movies, when you beat up the neighborhood bully; you suppose to live happily ever after. But around here; that's when all the drama begins...
E: V.O.
N: Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body. Two sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo. They flash their lights on him. CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.) Last Friday; I got fired for the first time. I got high for the first time. I got shot at for the first time and I kicked Debo's ass for the first time... They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the bushes like a knocked out prize fighter. The sheriffs laugh at him. Debo looks dazed and confused. The sheriffs help him out the bushes and start to cuff him. CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.) I was the man that night; and Debo ended up going to jail for a couple of years. But he told Ezal he was getting out next Friday. He said, when he see me, he was gonna smoke me on the spot... They walk him OUT OF FRAME...

S: EXT. LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING
N: OPENING CREDITS. It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks over the LA skyline. As the city starts to awake and the credits continue to roll; we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los Angeles. It seems that they all move to the same beat.
S: EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS
N: Debo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail. Still in his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the street. Everybody clears his path. SOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'. Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and directing traffic. Debo stops, the man starts to dance in front of him. He stares for a second, then he's on his way. Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the sidewalk (losing cool points). Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the latest dance steps on their way to school. Debo is walking towards them. They scream and take off in the other direction. He smiles. Briefly. Still walking; he stops at a corner. A SA boy waits to cross with his low-rider bike. A Metrolink train passes. After it goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike. He's on the ground holding his eye. Debo continues to ride through the city. He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's house.
S: EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Mr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house. A CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the lawn. It starts to BARK at Debo. He looks down at the dog and kicks him in the street. The DOG YIPES! Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house.
S: INT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's father), storms out of the bedroom. He struggles to put on his dog catcher's uniform. He stops at the bathroom door and knocks hard.
C: MR. JONES
D: Craig! Craig! Off yo' ass and on yo' feet; this ain't the time to beat your meat!
N: Mr. Jones laughs at himself.
C: CRAIG
D: I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
E: O.S.

D: Hurry up; today is Fri-day! And we gotta hit the high-way!
N: Mr. Jones continues on his way; dancing to the beat.
S: INT. BATHROOM - CLOSE-UP ON HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS

C: CRAIG
D: Soon as my pops found out what Debo said to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my uncle and little cousin in Rancho Cucamonga. Til' things calm down, or Debo went back to prison. Whichever comes first.
E: V.O.
N: He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting the finishing touches on his masterpiece. He licks, rolls and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans. CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.) I feel like the biggest punk around here. I wiped Debo's ass. He should be the one moving. He exits.
S: EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The front door opens. Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling back into the house.
C: MR. JONES
D: Craig! Let's go! I don't wanna hit that traffic.
N: He steps off the porch backwards and into "fresh Chihuahua shit." He slips and falls on the grass. MR. JONES (cont'd) I be got damn. Mr. Jones gets up. He brushes the grass off his uniform. He looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all over his back and butt. MR. JONES (cont'd) Craig! Craig! Craig emerges from the house with his bags in hand.
C: CRAIG
D: Here I come!
E: irritated

C: CRAIG
D: What's the matter?

C: DEBO
D: Craig! Get out the car, boy! This the rematch!
N: Debo reaches for his shank. Craig turns to Mr. Jones!
C: CRAIG
D: Daddy, punch it!
N: Mr. Jones floors it and hits Debo. He falls over the hood, off the car and in the street. The yellow truck speeds off. Debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises.
C: DEBO
D: You know I'mma find you! You can run ya' can't hide!
N: BACK IN CAR - CONTINUOUS Craig screams out the window.

C: CRAIG
D: Ya'll making me look like a punk.
E: with attitude
C: MR. JONES
D: It ain't about being a punk, son. It's about this...
N: Craig smells something in the air. MR. JONES (cont'd) My great, great grand daddy on my Momma side; had a saying... 'See a fool -- leave a fool.' Somebody else a get him. Plus, I don't want that fool shooting at my house trying to hit yo' ass.
C: CRAIG

C: CRAIG
D: I do.
E: holding his nose
C: MR. JONES
D: What it smell like?
C: CRAIG
D: Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
N: Mr. Jones grabs the air freshener from under the seat. He starts to spray too much. Craig's window won't roll down. CRAIG (cont'd) What's wrong with the window?
C: MR. JONES
D: I gotta get'em fixed. They don't roll down.
C: CRAIG
D: All damn.
C: MR. JONES
D: Just hold your breath.
S: EXT. CITY OF RANCHO CUCAMONGA - MORNING
N: They exit the freeway and pass a sign that reads, "Rancho Cucamonga" (the city away from the city).
S: EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Welcome to the suburbs. Where the "Smiley Happy People" live in peace and quiet. The neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story track homes as far as the eye can see. The yellow truck drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul-de-sac. Mr. Jones BLOWS the HORN.
C: MR. JONES
D: Nice neighborhood, huh?
C: CRAIG
D: It's alright.
C: MR. JONES
D: 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing. I still can't figure that one out.
C: CRAIG
D: Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
N: Uncle Elroy's house is royal blue with gold trim. All the other houses are painted in earth tones.
C: MR. JONES
D: Ah, son, don't be no hater. You know your uncle ain't got no taste. Just don't let him rub off on you.
N: Craig grabs his bags.
C: CRAIG
D: You coming in?
C: MR. JONES
D: No, I'mma go on to work. I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth. Now listen to me, Craig. It's gonna be different living over here. Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit. Understand?
C: CRAIG
D: Hey, Pops, I'm grown. Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
N: As craig gets out; the front door flies open. It's DAY-DAY (22), Craig's crazy younger cousin. He yells back into the house.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Daddy, Craig is here.
N: Day-Day walks out to the car and gives Craig a pound.
C: CRAIG

C: DAY-DAY
D: You. Hi, Uncle Willie.
C: MR. JONES
D: Hey, Day-Day. Where's yo' big head father?
C: DAY-DAY
D: There he is.
N: Just then, UNCLE ELROY (42) hits the door. Dressed in boxers and a T-shirt. This is Mr. Jones' (very loud) little brother.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
C: CRAIG
D: Naw, it ain't like that.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
C: CRAIG
D: Alright, I'll remember that.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: You know me? I would've shot his big ass. Hey, Willie, how's it going? Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
E: peeking into the ear
N: Uncle Elroy laughs. Mr. Jones isn't amused.
C: MR. JONES
D: Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.

D: Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro. He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby! This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent. Ain't that right, nephew?
N: Uncle Elroy hugs Craig by the arm.
C: MR. JONES
D: Craig, remember what I told you.

D: Send Betty my love. Boy you looking good. I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside. I got something to show you.
E: to Craig grabbing his bags
C: CRAIG
D: Thanks, Unc.
N: Uncle Elroy starts towards to the house.
C: DAY-DAY
D: You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last? Up at the family reunion.
C: CRAIG
D: I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
N: Day-Day laughs.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Yep. I forgot about him cussin' out everybody. Damn that was fun.
C: CRAIG
D: I know, we had a good time. But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
C: DAY-DAY
D: I know; this a long way from Watts. But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing. Just peace and quiet. Listen.
N: They do. It is quiet, except for a few BIRDS SINGING. DAY-DAY (cont'd) Shit sound good, huh? Just then, a maroon Cadillac low-rider on Daytons rolls up the block. It's the Jokers: JOKER (28), LI'L JOKER (21) and BABY JOKER (15). They pull into their driveway. DAY-DAY (cont'd) Aw damn. In SLOW MOTION: One by one they get out the car. They have a dog with them named "Cheeco." As they get to the front door they all look over at Craig and Day-Day. Day-Day looks away, while Craig keeps his eye on them. They disappear inside.
C: CRAIG
D: Who is that?
C: DAY-DAY
D: Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
C: CRAIG
D: They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
C: DAY-DAY
D: Naw, them dudes is assholes. Especially that dog - Cheeco. Watch this little ass, he's sneaky. Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.

D: Must be nice. I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million. We bought this house and I spent the rest on this. It's the bomb, huh?
C: CRAIG
D: This my baby. I feel like a new nigga in this car. I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
C: MISS HO KYM
D: Hi, Day-Day!
E: O.S.

C: CRAIG
D: Nice to meet you?
C: MISS HO KYM
D: Peace out, Craig.
S: INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Day-Day and Craig enter the house. They still have the furniture from the projects. Craig looks around. He spots at a few hanging pictures.
C: CRAIG
D: Man, this a cool house.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
E: picking up a picture
N: Mother's picture: she looks like Day-Day with a wig on. She's smiling and holding the winning lotto ticket. DAY-DAY (cont'd) But when she found out we won the money, she had a heart attack. You know the story.

D: Thanks for reminding me.
N: Day-Day exits. Craig is left to look around, until something outside catches his eye.
S: EXT. HOUSE
N: It's D'WANA (20), Day-Day's six-month pregnant girlfriend. She's walking on the right side of his BMW. With one hand she waves at Craig...with the other hand she's keying Day- Day's car with the skills of a retarded first-grader.
S: INT. HOUSE
N: Craig waves back, but something ain't right. Uncle Elroy steps in with SUGA (39), his nymphomaniac girlfriend. She's wearing a sexy nightie that's a size too small.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga. Suga, this is Craig.
C: SUGA
D: Oooh, ba-by!

C: DAY-DAY
D: Awwwww.... Awwwww....
E: staggering
C: D'WANA
D: I expect you to return all phone calls and take me to lunch today. I'll be back out here on my break. Nobody quits me.
N: D'Wana runs to her car. She speeds off. Uncle Elroy goes for the water hose. Craig grabs Day-Day.
C: DAY-DAY
D: I can't see! I can't see! Daddy!
C: CRAIG
D: Lay down, Day-Day. Stop moving.
N: Craig puts him on the grass.
C: DAY-DAY
D: She pepper-sprayed me, man! She pepper- sprayed me!
C: CRAIG
D: I know, be still.
N: Before he can say another word, Uncle Elroy nearly drowns him with the water hose.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Boy, you got you a little fatal attraction, huh? I had two or three of them in my day.
N: Day-Day is drowning. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) Craig, I hope you know how to deal with women better than this fool. Craig moves the hose.
C: CRAIG
D: That's too much water.
N: Now Day-Day is blind and choking.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Help him to his feet. Let's get him to the bathroom.
N: They get him up and into the house.
S: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: They rush Day-Day into the shower.
C: DAY-DAY

C: DAY-DAY
D: 20 minutes?
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Yeah, 20 minutes. Trust me. I've been pepper sprayed nine times. 20 minutes.
N: Uncle Elroy slams the door. Day-Day stands in the shower fully dressed and soaking wet. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) Let me show you my back yard. You know it's bigger than y'all back yard. They exit, leaving Day-Day in the shower.
S: EXT. ELROY'S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
N: Uncle Elroy and Craig start to walk around the back yard. In the B.G., we NOTICE giant weed plants everywhere.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig. I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs. But as soon as I got my check, I was gone. Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
C: CRAIG
D: You paid cash?
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Cash money. They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan. That's for suckas. They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago. I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
N: They walk over to the pool. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) You like that pool? It's half-full with dirty water. An upside-down lawn chair floats in it.
C: CRAIG
D: It's cool, but where's the water?
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
C: CRAIG
D: Y'all never use it?
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
E: humping the air
N: The Jacuzzi water has a purple condom floating in it. Uncle Elroy reaches over and picks it out. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) (shaking the water off the condom) You welcome get in it anytime you want to. Shit, you my brother's son.
C: CRAIG
D: That's okay, Unc. I can't swim, either.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Good.
S: EXT. CRACK HOUSE - MORNING
N: A run-down crack house sits alone in the middle of the block. It looks deserted with chipped paint, overgrown grass and security bars everywhere. Inside we can hear a FIGHT in progress.
C: CRACK DEALER
D: Ezal, I'm sick of you coming around here wit no money.
E: O.S.
N: Suddenly the door flies open and Ezal comes flying out on his ass.
C: EZAL
D: I be damned.
N: He gets up and brushes himself off. He heads back into the crack house. EZAL (cont'd) Now look here, man. I'mma preferred customer and I can take my credit card somewhere else. SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! Ezal is roughed up some more and flies through the picture window. GLASS rains down. EZAL (cont'd) Oh, my neck, oh, my back. Man, I quit! I'm retired! Officially! Life shouldn't be this hard for a crackhead! Ezal lays there in pain. Out of nowhere, a bicycle comes INTO FRAME. Ezal looks up at the rider. It's Debo.
C: DEBO
D: Where did Craig move to?
C: EZAL
D: I don't know, Debo.
N: Debo rolls on top of him with the front tire. Ezal is smashed and in more pain.
C: DEBO
D: What you say?
C: EZAL
D: He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
E: hurting
C: DEBO
D: Rancho Cucamonga?
C: EZAL
D: Yeah.
N: Debo thinks about it. EZAL (cont'd) I can't breathe. He rolls off of Ezal. Relief.
C: DEBO
D: Get on.
C: EZAL
D: Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
C: DEBO
D: Get on!
N: Ezal hops on the handlebars quick. They start to ride off.
C: EZAL
D: Just don't go over the curb.
N: Debo rides over the curb and into the street. The journey begins. EZAL (cont'd) Watch my balls!
S: INT. DAY-DAY'S ROOM - MORNING
N: Day-Day's room is junky. Clothes are everywhere. He's putting on his Pinky's Records and Disc T-shirt. Craig comes in.
C: CRAIG
D: You straight?
C: DAY-DAY
D: Yeah, I'm alright. Is my face still orange to you?
N: Day-Day's face looks sunburned.
C: CRAIG
D: Just a little.
C: DAY-DAY
D: I can't taste nothing.
C: CRAIG
D: What's the matter with your girlfriend?
C: DAY-DAY
D: Man, it's a long story. I met D'Wana three months ago. She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention. Come to find out, she six months pregnant. Saying I'm the daddy!
C: CRAIG

C: CRAIG

C: DAY-DAY
D: You don't know Baby D.
E: very serious
N: He looks at his watch. DAY-DAY (cont'd) I gotta get to Pinky's before I get fired like you. Day-Day exits. Craig is close behind.
S: EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: As they walk out the front door, someone catches Craig's eye. It's KARLA (23), the Joker brothers' fine sister. She's leaning against the lowrider, looking into her purse. She waves at them.
C: KARLA
D: Hi!
E: friendly
N: Craig and Day-Day are mesmerized.
C: BOTH
D: HEY!
E: waving back
N: Craig and Karla's eyes meet. She smiles.
C: CRAIG
D: Who is that?
C: DAY-DAY
D: That's the sister.
C: CRAIG
D: Yo know what? I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
C: DAY-DAY
D: I know what 'cha thinking. I thought the same thing. But it can't happen.
C: CRAIG
D: Why?
C: DAY-DAY
D: Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy. And I'm just trying to keep the peace. We moved out here to get away from that shit.
N: Day-Day walks over to his Beamer. Craig follows. CLOSE-UP Big scratch on the side of Day-Day's car. WIDER DAY-DAY (cont'd) It ain't that bad, is it? Craig is still looking at Karla. DAY-DAY (cont'd) Craig! It ain't that bad, is it?
C: CRAIG
D: Yeah, it's bad. And that scratch make it ugly.
N: Day-Day is starting to get mad. CRAIG (cont'd) It's long and crooked...make you not wanna even drive it.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Alright, alright... I see what you talking about.
N: Karla looks at her watch and starts to walk up the street. This is Craig's chance.
C: CRAIG
D: Hold up, Day-Day.
N: He trots after her.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Let it go.
N: Karla is still walking.
C: CRAIG
D: Hey! Hey!
N: She stops and waits for him. CRAIG (cont'd) I'm Day-Day's cousin, Craig. What's your name?
C: KARLA
D: Karla.
C: CRAIG
D: Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together. Where you going?
C: KARLA
D: To the Cucamonga shopping center.
C: CRAIG
D: Oh yeah, why you walking?
C: KARLA
D: My brothers won't give me a ride.
N: Day-Day is about to have a heart attack. He's looking back and forth between Craig and Karla, and the Joker's house where somebody is looking out the window.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Just get the number and come on. Just get the number and come on.
E: to himself
N: Back at the "Love Connection," Craig has Karla smiling.
C: CRAIG
D: You want us to give you a ride?
C: KARLA
D: I don't know.
C: CRAIG
D: What you mean, you don't know? Just wait here.
N: Craig starts to trot over towards Day-Day. Day-Day is frantically waving Craig to hurry. CRAIG (cont'd) What are you worried about? Day-Day's eyes get as big as golf balls.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Cheeco!
N: Craig turns to see the pit bull "Cheeco" running right after him.
C: KARLA
D: Cheeco, no!
N: Craig runs right towards Day-Day's BMW.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Oh shit, jump!
N: They both jump on top of Day-Day's BMW with CHEECO coming up fast. He's BARKING viciously. ACROSS STREET Joker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street laughing. Karla is embarrassed. ON BMW Craig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is terrified. DAY-DAY (cont'd) Hey, Joker! Stop playing, man! Call the dog back! They continue to laugh. Craig pulls his belt off. He swings it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the buckle. The DOG CRIES and runs back across the street. The Jokers aren't laughing anymore. Joker stares at Craig. Craig stares back. You can feel the tension. Joker kicks the dog.
C: JOKER
D: Get yo dumb ass in the back.
N: CHEECO HOLLERS. Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the BMW.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Look at my roof.
N: Big dents in the roof of his BMW. DAY-DAY (cont'd) Man, why you do that? I told you not to talk to that girl.
C: CRAIG
D: Why not? She was cool with it.
N: Day-Day gets into the car.
C: DAY-DAY
D: So.
C: CRAIG
D: What you mean, so?
C: DAY-DAY
D: If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that.
N: He slams the door, starts the car and backs up. Leaving Craig standing there. He sees Karla walking away. He looks over at the Jokers. They're still staring hard. Craig just looks away and walks into the house.
S: INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Craig steps into the house.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Nephew, you got perfect timing...
N: Uncle Elroy is sitting on the couch. He has a Phillies' Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) We about to start a little puff, puff give in this mothafucka. Are you down? Suga is sippin' on a glass of wine. She moves over, making room in the middle.
C: SUGA
D: Come on, Craig. Sit down right here.
E: patting the couch
N: Craig does. Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight. Uncle Elroy licks the cigar.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: I know you smoke weed, right?
C: CRAIG
D: Why you say that?
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: 'Cause your lips is getting black.
N: Uncle Elroy takes the razor and starts to cut the cigar the long way. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) All I smoke is blunts. Them fuckin' Zigzags don't do nothing for me. Uncle Elroy scrapes the cigar shavings into a nearby trash can (that's overflowing with cigar shavings already). Suga presses against Craig.
C: SUGA
D: Would you like a glass of wine, baby?
C: CRAIG
D: No thank you. It's too early.
N: Uncle Elroy stuffs the open cigar full of weed. He's concentrating.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Boy, I can roll a blunt better than them bitches in Havana. I know Willie don't let'cha smoke in the house, but I'm ya uncle. I don't care how high you get in my house. Long as you let me hit it...
N: He licks and rolls. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) Look at that. It's perfect.
C: SUGA
D: Fire it up, Roy.
N: Uncle Elroy grabs the lighter.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Now I'mma show you the real "Puff Daddy."
N: He lights the blunt. Craig's watching, so is Suga. Uncle Elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time. Maybe too long...'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke (cough with your mouth closed). And toke. And toke. And toke. It looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a big puff of smoke. Then he starts to cough, and cough, and cough out of control. Craig and Suga are amazed at this display. Uncle Elroy falls to the floor on his hands and knees. Still coughing. He falls on his back and passes the blunt to Craig. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) (still coughing) It's the Bombay. Craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips. He hits it, holds it in and looks at Suga. Suddenly, his eyes bulge out and he starts to toke, and toke, and toke, and toke. He starts to cough out of control and he falls next to Uncle Elroy who's still coughing. Craig passes the blunt to Suga, who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly INTO the CAMERA. (As if to say, "Shiiiiiiiiiiiit.").
S: INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER
N: All three are passed out on the couch. Uncle Elroy is snoring with a little slobber hanging. Craig's knocked out with his mouth open. Suga's head is not secure and she's starting to bob. She bobs so hard that her head falls in Craig's lap. He wakes up and looks down.
C: CRAIG
D: Suga.
N: He looks over at Uncle Elroy who's looking over at him.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
C: CRAIG
D: I don't know!
E: confused and dazed
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Suga!
C: SUGA
D: Huh?
E: face in lap
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: What you doing to my nephew?
C: SUGA
D: Ah, baby...I thought this was you. Craig, what are you doing to me?
E: lifting her head to Craig
C: CRAIG
D: I don't know, I think I passed out or something. I don't remember.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Passed out? Can't hang, huh? Boy, I knew you was a lightweight. Passed out on one funky ass blunt. They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
N: Uncle Elroy staggers to his feet. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) Come on, woman. I'm faded and feeling X- rated. It's Mr. Nasty time.
C: SUGA
D: Mr. Nasty time?
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl.
E: grabbing his back
C: SUGA
D: Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
N: Suga takes Elroy's hand.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Make yourself at home.
N: They both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone. It's too quiet now. He grabs the remote and TURNS ON the TV. Flicks a few channels. He picks up the blunt and the lighter. ON TV A public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center. It's SMOKEY!
C: SMOKEY
D: Hi, my name is Smokey. And I'm a bud- head. But here at the King/Drew Rehab Center, they help you curve your crave for marijuana but still let you get your drank on.
E: V.O.
N: He lifts a 22 oz. bottle of Olde English. SMOKEY (cont'd) (V.O.) It's too hard to stop everything all at once. So some days they let you smoke, but not drank. And other days you can drank, but not smoke. And if you're really making progress, the nurses will get fucked up wit you. Helping you kick the habit by smoking up all yo shit. So come down to the King/Drew Rehab Center and put down the joint, but B.Y.O.B., man! BACK ON COUCH Craig is high. He's looking at the TV with a slight smile on his face. It seems like the walls are shaking. He looks over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic Park. Plaster falls from the ceiling. He listens, it's Uncle Elroy and Suga making love.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Oh, baby, right there. Right there...bite the nipple, baby. Bite it! Bite it! Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come on, baby, get busy...
E: O.S.
N: His eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud KNOCK on the door. Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move. The KNOCKING gets LOUDER.
C: DELIVERY GUY
D: Delivery!
E: O.S.
C: CRAIG
D: Hold on.
N: Craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area. The KNOCKING CONTINUES.
C: DELIVERY GUY
D: Delivery!
E: O.S.
C: CRAIG
D: I said hold on!
C: DELIVERY GUY
D: Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
E: O.S.
N: Craig stops what he's doing and swings the door open. ON PORCH The DELIVERY GUY, a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts and a buzz cut, is looking into the house.
C: CRAIG
D: Can I help you?
C: DELIVERY GUY
D: Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
C: CRAIG
D: I don't play for no team.
C: DELIVERY GUY
D: Come on, jerky, you can tell me. Got a white wife, huh? Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for? You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
C: CRAIG
D: Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers. You want tickets?
E: in his face
C: DELIVERY GUY
D: Okay, buddy. Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me. It's just a certified mail delivery.
N: He hands Craig a letter. DELIVERY GUY (cont'd) Sign here. Craig signs.
C: CRAIG
D: What is it?
C: DELIVERY GUY
D: Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go. Wife stays here, of course.
N: He laughs and walks off singing the "Good Times" jingle. DELIVERY GUY (cont'd) '...temporary layoffs? Good Times...hustling and surviving... Good Times...ain't we lucky we got'em...' Oh shit! Cheeco starts to chase him down the street. Craig looks at the notice. "DELINQUENT! YOUR HOUSE WILL BE SEIZED AND AUCTIONED -- TOMORROW AT 9AM PAY TODAY!"
C: CRAIG
D: Oh damn.
N: He SLAMS the DOOR. We FOLLOW Craig upstairs TO Uncle Elroy's room. He knocks softly. CRAIG (cont'd) Uncle Elroy? No answer. CRAIG (cont'd) Uncle Elroy, you got a tax notice. Still no answer. He turns the knob. It's open.
S: INT. UNCLE ELROY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Craig steps into Uncle Elroy's freak palace. Black lights, candles, velvet posters - the works. There's even a leather fuck swing hanging from the ceiling. Uncle Elroy and Suga are asleep in a leopard-skin waterbed. Craig is amazed. He slowly walks over to the bed. Uncle Elroy is calling the hogs. Snoring.
C: CRAIG
D: Uncle Elroy...Uncle Elroy?
E: whispering
N: He's about to shake him when Uncle Elroy lets out a big grunt. It startles Craig. He looks over at Suga. She's completely under the covers. Uncle Elroy rolls over on his stomach, then he rolls on his back again. Craig shakes him. CRAIG (cont'd) Uncle Elroy, wake up. You got a letter today. No response. Craig tries again. CRAIG (cont'd) Unc. Uncle Elroy jumps up like a hibernating grizzly.
C: UNCLE ELROY
D: Come on here, Suga...
E: half asleep
N: He goes after Craig, who has to fight him off. UNCLE ELROY (cont'd) I like it rough now.
C: CRAIG
D: Naw, naw! Unc, wake up! It's me! Wake up!
N: Uncle Elroy grabs him in a bear hug and slams him on the bed. Craig finds himself caught between Suga and Uncle Elroy, but now everything is totally still and quiet. Uncle Elroy starts to snore again. He's asleep. The coast is clear now. Craig tries to make his escape. He crawls over Suga to get away. She grabs him and starts to kiss him.
C: SUGA
D: Ohhh, baby!
E: half asleep
N: Craig breaks away and tries to hurry out the room. On his exit, he hangs himself on the "fuck swing" and hits the floor with a thud. He scrambles to his feet, then he's out of there. Uncle Elroy and Suga lay asleep as if nothing ever happened. IN HALLWAY Craig tries to gain his composure. He gets an idea.
S: EXT. BUSY CITY STREET - AFTERNOON
N: Debo is riding Ezal on the handlebars.

C: EZAL
D: You too big.
C: DEBO

D: Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
C: ROACH
D: That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
N: Day-Day is still sad. ROACH (cont'd) I know how you feeling. And if I had my bong right now, I'd let you 'toke 'til you choke.' Dude, right here. All out. No lungs. All I got is this. Roach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it.
C: CRAIG
D: What's the green stuff poking out?
C: ROACH
D: That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
C: CRAIG
D: Naw, I already ate.
C: ROACH
D: Come on, Day, try it. For moms.
N: Day-Day shakes his head. Craig reaches into his fifth pocket.
C: CRAIG
D: It ain't a bong but, wa-la!
N: He has the joint from this morning.
C: ROACH
D: Wo!
N: Roach snatches it.
C: CRAIG
D: Hey.
N: Craig snatches it back.
C: ROACH
D: Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do that?
C: CRAIG
D: Black magic.
N: Day-Day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Give me dat. I'm the one with the problem.
N: Roach pulls out a mini-skateboard that's actually a lighter.
C: ROACH
D: Weed doesn't solve problems. It eases the mind, and the soul. Enjoy.
N: He lights the joint. Day-Day takes a hit.
C: CRAIG
D: I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
C: DAY-DAY
D: I don't.
E: letting out the smoke
C: ROACH
D: I do.

E: hitting it good
C: CRAIG
D: You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Ain't no windows in here.
C: ROACH
D: I got an idea.
N: He hands the joint to Craig. Gets up and closes the door. Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner. ROACH (cont'd) This is a little theory of mine... it should work. He plugs in the VACUUM and TURNS it ON. He puts the nozzle in Day-Day's face.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Blow.
C: CRAIG
D: That ain't gonna work.
C: ROACH
D: Fuck yeah.
N: Day-Day hits the 'J and blows into the nozzle. It quickly sucks up the smoke.
C: DAY-DAY
D: It works.
E: passing the 'J
C: CRAIG
D: Still gonna smell it.
C: ROACH
D: No way. Watch this.
N: Roach hits the joint harder than anyone else. Smoke starts to come out of his ears. Craig and Day-Day get a kick out of that.
S: EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS
N: A pink limo pulls to a stop. The chauffeur gets out wearing his suit just a little too tight. He opens the door and a pair of pink boots hit the pavement. The CAMERA PANS UP TO PINKY (35), the asshole owner.
C: PINKY
D: Look, man, you hittin' them goddamn corners too fast. Slow down. I almost spilled my Hennessy on this 300 dollar suit.
N: He walks over to the door. He thinks it's open. It's not. PINKY (cont'd) I be damn. He shakes the door. It's locked. He looks inside. No one's at the counter. Cassettes all over the floor. Pinky looks around making sure no one sneaks up on him. He reaches under his shirt and pulls out a Glock 9mm. Sticks his key in the door and steps in. BACK STORE AREA - CLOSE UP - ROACH is upside down. All the blood has rushed to his head. He has Chinaman eyes and a big smile on his face.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Roach, what are you doing?
C: ROACH
D: R-U-S-H Intensely.
N: A big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and hits the deck. ROACH (cont'd) My spleen. Craig and Day-Day laugh at Roach. The VACUUM is still GOING but the room is very smoky. Craig jumps in.
C: CRAIG
D: This vacuum don't work. Where's the restroom?
E: unplugging the vacuum
C: DAY-DAY
D: Out the door and to the left.
C: ROACH
D: I thought the vacuum would work.

C: PINKY
D: Don't move or I'll blow your head smooth off.
E: whispering
N: Craig throws his hands up. PINKY (cont'd) Now back up slowly... and don't say a word. He obeys. Pinky backs Craig into the store. PINKY (cont'd) Get on the floor. Craig gets down. PINKY (cont'd) Little mothafucka trying to rob me. I'mma show you how I do 'em.
C: CRAIG
D: I ain't trying to rob you...

C: PINKY
D: I said shut up! Now who sent you?
C: CRAIG
D: Nobody!
C: PINKY
D: If you say another word, it's over. I'm not playing!
N: Pinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets. PINKY (cont'd) You ain't got no gun, but where's the weed at? I smell it. Craig says nothing. PINKY (cont'd) I'mma tie you ass up! Pinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard. The gun goes flying and so does he. Pinky falls on his ass. The 9mm lands in front of Craig. There's a big scramble for the gun. BACK STORAGE AREA The mood is serious.
C: DAY-DAY
D: I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
C: ROACH
D: You could sell your Beamer.
N: Day-Day gives Roach the evil-eye. ROACH (cont'd) My bad.
C: DAY-DAY
D: I don't know. I hope Craig got a good idea. We gotta ask him when he comes out. Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
C: ROACH
D: Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
C: ROACH
D: I know.
N: BACK INSIDE STORE Pinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun. The store looks like a tornado hit it. Twice. Craig comes up with the pistol. Pinky jumps on the ground.
C: PINKY
D: Don't kill me.
N: Craig is exhausted. He stands over Pinky with the gun.
C: CRAIG
D: Shut up. I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin. They're right there in the back.
C: PINKY
D: Whatever you say, man. I didn't see shit. The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
N: Just then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back.
C: DAY-DAY
D: Craig, what the hell are you doing?

D: Nothing.
C: PINKY
D: Day-Day, is this your cousin?
C: DAY-DAY
D: Yeah.

C: PINKY
D: I smell weed.
N: He looks up at Craig. PINKY (cont'd) And you...you lucky. I was just about to get in yo' ass. Now give me my pistol back and get the hell out my store. Craig looks at Day-Day. Day-Day looks back at him. Nobody's high now.

C: ROACH
D: My board!
N: The Joker Bros. back their low-rider into the driveway. They have no sympathy. Cheeco (the pitbull) is in the back yard. He's happy to see them. They stroll into the house with three Mexican girls with them. Joker spots our trio looking.

C: DAY-DAY
D: You make it sound so easy.
C: CRAIG
D: It is easy. You know why? 'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.

ROACH (cont'd) Ooooohhhh I love to eat it everyday if you ask me what I'll say. We can hear TINY FOOTSTEPS RUNNING at Roach. ROACH (cont'd) Cheeco's got to be the dumbest fuckin' mutt in the whole wide U.S.A. CHEECO is running at Roach full speed. He jumps on the fence and starts to BARK with everything he's got. Roach drops the baloney. CRAIG AND DAY-DAY ...hear the DOG BARKING and freeze in their tracks. Day-Day tries to run. Craig grabs him, again.

D: No, keep working.
N: In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the curtain. The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye looking in. Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt off and two half-naked girls on his arms.
