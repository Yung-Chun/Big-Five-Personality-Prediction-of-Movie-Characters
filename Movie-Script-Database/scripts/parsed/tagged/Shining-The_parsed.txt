C: WATSON
D: Fine.
C: ULLMAN
D: Jack is a schoolteacher.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK.
C: JACK
D: Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
C: WATSON
D: What line of work are you in now?
E: OFF
C: JACK
D: I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. WATSON.
C: WATSON
D: Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK
C: JACK
D: Well, I'm looking for a change.
C: ULLMAN
D: Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and, for once, I agree with them.
E: OFF
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN
C: ULLMAN
D: Let's see, where were we? Yes. I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK
C: JACK
D: Do you mind if I ask why you do that? It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
C: ULLMAN
D: Oh, it sure would be
E: OFF
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN
C: ULLMAN
D: but the problem is the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to the Sidewinder open. It's a... It's a 25 mile stretch of road - gets an average of 20 feet of snow during the winter, and there's just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear. When the place was built in 1907, there was very little interest in winter sports, and this site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: M.L.S. ULLMAN over WATSON & JACK.
C: JACK
D: Well, it's certainly got plenty of that.
N: JACK laughs.
C: ULLMAN
D: That's right. And did they give you any idea in Denver about what the job entails?
C: JACK
D: Only in a very general way.
C: ULLMAN
D: Well...
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN
C: ULLMAN
D: ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK
C: JACK
D: Well, that sounds fine to me.
N: ULLMAN grunts off.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN
C: ULLMAN
D: Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK
C: JACK
D: Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
E: MORE
C: JACK
D: five months of peace is just what I want.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN
C: ULLMAN
D: That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK.
C: ULLMAN
D: can of itself be a problem.
E: OFF CONT'D
C: JACK
D: Not for me.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN.
C: ULLMAN
D: How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?

D: They'll love it.
C: ULLMAN
D: Great...
E: OFF
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN
C: ULLMAN
D: Well, before I turn you over to Bill, there is one other thing I think we should talk about. I don't want to sound melodramatic, but it is something that's...
E: MORE
C: ULLMAN
D: been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK
C: JACK
D: I'm intrigued.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN.
C: ULLMAN
D: I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK shakes his head.
C: JACK
D: I don't believe they did.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. BILL WATSON.
C: ULLMAN
D: Well, my predecessor in this job
E: OFF
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN.
C: ULLMAN
D: hired a man named Charles Grady, as the winter caretaker. He came up here with his wife and two little girls of about eight or ten. And he had a good employment record, good references and from what I've been told, I mean, he seemed like a completely normal individual. But at some point during the winter, he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: ULLMAN
D: He ran amok and eh... killed his family with an axe,
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK
C: ULLMAN
D: stacked them neatly in one of the rooms in the West Wing, and then he um... then he put eh both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.

E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK
C: ULLMAN
D: shut in together over long periods of time.
E: OFF CONT'D
C: JACK
D: Well, that is eh quite a story.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. ULLMAN laughs.
C: ULLMAN
D: Yes, it is. Oh, it's still hard for me to believe that it actually happened here, but it did and eh... I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK.
C: JACK
D: Ah, I certainly can, and eh... I also understand why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me.
N: JACK laughs.
T: CUT TO:
N: U.S. ULLMAN laughing.
C: ULLMAN
D: Well, obviously some people can be
T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. JACK.
C: ULLMAN
D: put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
E: OFF CONT'D
C: JACK
D: Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.

D: But eh what was the matter with him?
C: DOCTOR
D: Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained. They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. DOCTOR.
C: DOCTOR

T: CUT TO:
N: M.C.S. WENDY - she shakes her head.

N: WENDY inhales.
C: DOCTOR
D: How did he manage to do that?
E: OFF
C: WENDY
D: Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night. And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
T: CUT TO:
N: M.S. DOCTOR
