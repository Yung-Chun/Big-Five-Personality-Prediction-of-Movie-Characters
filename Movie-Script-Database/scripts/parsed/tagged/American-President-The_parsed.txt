N: As the OPENING TTTLES ROLL against a series of shots of statues and paintings of former presidents, we HEAR shards of dialogue from various presidential speeches. MAIN TITLES END ON
S: EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
N: It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment before we
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY
N: A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.
C: AGENT COOPER
D: Liberty's moving.
N: Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is followed a step or two later by PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD. SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy, professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.
C: JANIE
D: The 10:15 event's been moved inside to the Indian Treaty Room.
C: SHEPHERD
D: The 10:15 is American Fisheries?
E: to Janie
C: JANIE
D: Yes, sir. They're giving you a 200-pound halibut.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Janie, make a note. We need to schedule more events where somebody gives me a really big fish.
N: JANIE starts to make a note.
C: JANIE
D: Yes, sir.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Janie, I was kidding.
C: JANIE
D: Of course, sir.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Hey, Cooper.
E: to the AGENT at the elevator
C: AGENT COOPER
D: 'Morning, Mr. President.
N: SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...
C: JANIE
D: Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Is he upset about the speech last night?
C: JANIE
D: He seemed concerned.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning unless Lewis was concerned about something I did Sunday night.
N: The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32, LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night, though that doesn't seem to slow him down.
C: LEWIS
D: You skipped the whole paragraph.
C: SHEPHERD
D: And Monday morning it is.
E: to Janie
N: LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the double doors leading to the South Lawn.
C: LEWIS
D: "American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society"...and then nothing. You dumped the whole handguns paragraph.
C: SHEPHERD
D: This is a time for prudence, Lewis.
C: LEWIS
D: That was the kick-ass section.
N: The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West Wing.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I thought what with being the President and all...
C: LEWIS
D: Sir, of course I didn't mean to imply--
C: SHEPHERD
D: I thought you'd be turning cartwheels this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job approval.
C: LEWIS
D: That's great news, sir, but...
N: They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.
C: GROUNDKEEPER
D: 'Morning, Mr. President.
N: Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting, JANIE quickly and quietly said--
C: JANIE
D: Charlie.
C: SHEPHERD
D: 'Morning, Charlie.
C: LEWIS
D: Sir, the press is gonna need an explanation.
C: SHEPHERD
D: For what?
N: SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make their way through the corridors of
S: INT. THE WEST WING - DAY
N: They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES AND OFFICE WORKERS.
C: LEWIS
D: Because you dropped the whole kick-ass section, now we've got this thing hanging out there.
C: SHEPHERD
D: There's a thing hanging out there?
C: LEWIS
D: "Americans can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society." Then ...nothing. No explanation. No context. So now it's just this thing.
C: SHEPHERD
D: And it's hanging out there?
C: LEWIS
D: Yes, sir.
N: SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Maria--
C: STAFFER
D: Good morning, sir.
E: MARIA
C: SHEPHERD
D: Did they tell you I'm gonna need--
C: STAFFER
D: --overall consumer spending and not just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have it for you in 15 minutes.
E: MARIA
C: SHEPHERD
D: Thanks.
N: SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.
C: LEWIS
D: Mr. President, I really feel we need to focus on...
C: SHEPHERD
D: Lewis, however much coffee you drink in the morning, I want you to reduce it by half.
C: LEWIS
D: I don't drink coffee.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Then hit yourself over the head with a baseball bat, would you please?
N: Another STAFFER crosses their path--
C: JANIE
D: Happy birthday, Laura.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Hey, Laura, happy birthday.
C: STAFFER
D: Thank you, sir.
E: LAURA
N: Once out of earshot--
C: SHEPHERD
D: I should send her some flowers.
E: to JANIE
C: JANIE
D: You already did, sir.
N: And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into
S: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
N: In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary, is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD walks in--
C: MRS. CHAPIL
D: Good morning, Mr. President.
C: SHEPHERD
D: How're you, Mrs. Chapil?
C: MRS. CHAPIL
D: Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left the detailed breakdown of the approval poll for you. He seemed to indicate that it was very good news.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.
N: And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading, listening, and talking at the same time.
C: MRS. CHAPIL
D: Lucy called just a moment ago. You forgot to sign her permission slip for her class--
C: JANIE
D: --the museum trip. I'll go get it.
C: SHEPHERD
D: What time does she get home today?
E: to JANIE
C: JANIE
D: Three-twenty.
C: SHEPHERD
D: How's my afternoon look?
C: JANIE
D: Very crowded.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Schedule some time for me at 3:30.
C: WOMAN
D: Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.
E: O.S.
N: This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico?
C: ROBIN
D: I didn't truly appreciate it until I came back and discovered that America isn't a great society.
C: LEWIS
D: He dumped a whole section.
E: to ROBIN
C: SHEPHERD
D: Now there's a thing hanging out there.
C: ROBIN
D: Not a great society, sir?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Well, with you out of the country, it wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back, we're great again.
C: ROBIN
D: There's a press room full of people saying "What did he mean by that?"
C: LEWIS
D: See?
C: SHEPHERD
D: A.J., did you get one of these?
E: re: a memo he's been looking at
N: This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor, he's the President's closest and oldest friend.
C: A.J.
D: Is that the letter from Solomon at the GDC?
C: SHEPHERD
D: It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. These people are outta control.
C: A.J.
D: I think they're just frustrated, Mr. President.
C: ROBIN
D: Are they blaming the President for global warming?
C: A.J.
D: Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean.
N: (continuing; to SHEPHERD) Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point.
C: LEWIS
D: What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions.
C: A.J.
D: It won't pass at 20 percent.
C: LEWIS
D: We haven't really tried.
C: A.J.
D: Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers. If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor. But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull their support, fine. At 63 percent job approval rating. I don't need their help getting a bill passed. We gotta get going-- where's Leon?
C: A.J.
D: Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him the President's--
E: to an AIDE
N: A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on pedestrian collision in the outer office--
C: MRS. CHAPIL
D: Aaagh!
E: O.S.
C: KODAK
D: Sorry! Sorry, my fault.
E: O.S.
C: A.J.
D: Never mind.
E: to the AIDE
N: LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close over the past few years.
C: KODAK
D: Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.
C: SHEPHERD
D: You all right?
C: KODAK
D: They keep moving that big ficus plant.
C: A.J.
D: We're all here, Mr. President.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Okay. First, I wanted to say congratulations. Three years ago, we were elected to the White House by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job.
C: KODAK
D: Wait a second. You wanted me to poll registered voters?
N: Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...
C: SHEPHERD
D: But the poll also tells us what we already knew: We don't get this crime bill of ours through Congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. So, starting today, we're shifting it into gear.
C: ROBIN
D: Can I tell my morning press gaggle that gun control--
C: A.J.
D: Crime control, Robin. Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime.
C: LEWIS
D: Hang on, are we not--
C: A.J.
D: Lewis--
C: LEWIS
D: Are we not putting back the handgun restrictions?!
C: A.J.
D: We're leaving 'em out.
C: LEWIS
D: Sir, we campaigned on this issue. Now, I understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now.
C: SHEPHERD
D: After the elections.
C: LEWIS
D: Sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again. Let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do.
C: SHEPHERD
D: We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis. We need it to get re-elected. For reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun-related crime.
C: A.J.
D: Robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. As of today, the crime bill's priority one on the President's domestic agenda.
C: ROBIN
D: Got it.
C: A.J.
D: Leon, you're gonna run the war room. We're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week. And, Leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do what the N.R.A. does.
C: KODAK
D: Scare the shit out of 'em?
C: A.J.
D: Yeah.
C: KODAK
D: I can do that.
C: A.J.
D: Lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this. You're gonna run the show on the hill.
C: LEWIS
D: Can I just say, to return to the subject for one moment, that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we weren't arming drug dealers.
N: SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a temper.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights we can win.
C: LEWIS
D: Yes, sir.
C: A.J.
D: We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today. The last nose count put us 18 votes short.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you, everyone. Janie, what's next?
C: A.J.
D: Thank you, Mr. President.
N: The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank you, Mr. President"'s as they exit.
C: JANIE
D: Security briefing, sir.

S: INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: LEO, a white-haired man in his early 60's is meeting with SUSAN SLOAN, a 40'ish lawyer who seems to go out of her way to create an issue where none exists.
C: SUSAN
D: Did the President read the letter?
C: LEO
D: The President's pissed as hell, Susan. That letter was a stupid move.
C: SUSAN
D: It was aggressive, and we should stand by every--
C: LEO
D: This isn't the guy who needed us four years ago, Susan. He's incredibly popular. He's gonna win re-election in a walk, and he could give a shit what we stand by! If the President passes the most important piece of environmental legislation in history, and does it despite our negative endorsement, our political weight in the future will rank somewhere below the Save the Spotted Owl Society. I'm bringing in some help.
E: beat
C: SUSAN
D: We don't need another environmental expert to confirm what every other environmental expert--
C: LEO
D: Not an environmental expert, a professional political strategist. We're playing hardball with Andrew Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.
C: SUSAN
D: Who?
C: LEO
D: Sydney Ellen Wade.
C: SUSAN
D: Oh Christ. That woman doesn't know the first thing about the environmental lobby.
C: LEO
D: She's a closer, Susan. She gets the job done.

E: entering
C: LEWIS
D: What did you tell him?
C: ROBIN
D: I told him I couldn't speak for the President, but for my money: Bermuda.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Perfect.
N: JANIE steps in--
C: JANIE
D: Mr. President, your cousin Judith's come down with the flu and won't be able to join you Thursday night.
C: SHEPHERD
D: That's too bad. Remind me to give her a call later.
C: JANIE
D: Yes, sir.
C: ROBIN
D: You gonna go stag?
C: SHEPHERD
D: That's not a problem.
C: ROBIN
D: No. We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower.
N: The words came out casually, but they instantly freeze everyone.
C: ROBIN
D: My God. I can't believe I said that. Mr. President, that was an incredibly thoughtless remark. I would never dream of insulting you or the memory of your wife.
E: continuing beat beat
C: SHEPHERD
D: That's okay, forget it. What time is it?
E: to JANIE
C: JANIE
D: It's 3:45, sir.
C: SHEPHERD

C: JANIE
D: You have the Attorney General at 4:00 and the trade representative at 4:30. Somewhere in there you promised NPR five minutes.

S: INT. THE RESIDENCE - DAY
N: We HEAR the sound of a TROMBONE being played--not well--from one of the rooms. SHEPHERD comes around and down the corridor. He walks into--
S: INT. LUCY'S ROOM - DAY
N: LUCY, Shepherd's 12-year-old daughter, stops playing.
C: SHEPHERD
D: No, keep going. I liked what you were playing? What's it called?
C: LUCY
D: Scales.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Well... you play it with gusto!
C: LUCY
D: Are my lips swollen?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Are they supposed to be?
C: LUCY
D: Yeah.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Then you're doing fine.
C: LUCY
D: Whatcha got behind your back?
C: SHEPHERD
D: A little gift.
C: LUCY
D: Is it a dirt bike?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Nope.
N: He hands her an old textbook ...
C: LUCY
D: Is it a really old seventh-grade textbook of yours that you're gonna make me read cover to cover and discuss at dinner and drive me crazy with?
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm not comfortable with the "really old" part, but everything else you said was true.
C: LUCY
D: "Understanding the Constitution."
E: reading the cover
C: SHEPHERD
D: Your social studies teacher said your class would be starting on the Constitution this week.
C: LUCY
D: You talked to Mr. Linder?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher Conference. Mr. Linder and I were the key player in that discussion. Why don't you like social studies, Luce?
C: LUCY
D: I like it fine, Dad.
C: SHEPHERD
D: All your other teachers say you're happy, you're enthusiastic, you've always got your hand up...Mr. Linder says you don't participate unless he calls on you, and even then it's a one-word answer.
C: LUCY
D: I don't know what to say, Dad. I guess I'm just not...I don't know.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Luce, take a look at this book. This is exciting stuff. It's about who we are and what we want. Read what it says on the first page.
C: LUCY
D: "Property of Gilmore Junior High School."
E: reading
C: SHEPHERD
D: The next page.
C: LUCY
D: "We, the People, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union..."
E: reading
C: SHEPHERD
D: See? Grabs you right off the bat. It's a page-turner.
C: LUCY
D: I can't wait.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Good, 'cause it's possible the subject might come up at dinner tonight.
C: LUCY
D: Do you see it as part of your job to torture me?
C: SHEPHERD
D: No, it's just one of the perks. See you tonight.

C: DEFENSE SECRETARY
D: The C-STAD hardware's been in place for a month. We've got 22 instructors from the Army Air Defense School waiting to go down and train the Israelis.
C: A.J.
D: How soon can you deploy them?
C: CHAIRMAN
D: We can airlift 'em in the morning. They'll have C-STAD operational in 20 days.
C: A.J.
D: Any security concerns?
C: SECURITY ADVISOR
D: If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd have hit it by now.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Okay. Let's move on it. Thank you, gentlemen.
N: SHEPHERD and A.J. leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of "good-bye" 's and "Thank you, Mr. President"'s. They pass MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil.
E: continuing
C: MRS. CHAPIL
D: You too, Mr. President.
N: SHEPHERD starts his walk from the West Wing back to the residence. It is the exact reverse of the path he took to the OVAL OFFICE in the morning.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'll see you in the morning, Janie.
C: JANIE
D: You will, Mr. President.
N: A SECRET SERVICE AGENT follows at a distance. AGENT #2 (sotto) Liberty is moving.
C: A.J.
D: Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun at the GDC.
C: SHEPHERD
D: It's about time.
C: A.J.
D: She's a lawyer from Virginia named Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman well. She's had a lot of success getting congressmen elected.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Maybe we should try to steal her. Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that.
C: A.J.
D: You know, if you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello. It might smooth the way.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Mention it to Janie.
C: A.J.
D: Good.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Then let's clear this off the table and get everybody focused on the crime bill. I don't want to win this. I want to win it by a couple of touchdowns.
C: A.J.
D: We will, Mr. President.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Good.

E: to the GUARD
C: SUSAN
D: He doesn't know what Capra-esque means.

C: EDUCATION SECRETARY
D: I know the proposal only scratches the surface, but it's the least we can do.
C: SHEPHERD
D: We're already doing the least we can do, but I can't think of anything better, so we'll go with this for now. Jerry, say hello to Linda for me. And if I don't see you again, have a good Thanksgiving.

T: CUT TO:
N: INT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY
C: A.J.
D: Your concerns are not falling on deaf ears. The environmental lobby has known no greater alley in the White House than President Shepherd.
C: SYDNEY
D: Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.
N: SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable--
C: SUSAN
D: Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney alone now. He's already given us more time than--
C: SYDNEY
D: Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's not yet done what he needs to do today.
C: SUSAN
D: Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the deep end of the pool on her first day. She hasn't even had a chance to read the report of the Quebec Conference.
N: SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes, check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides, instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.
C: SYDNEY
D: You're right. I haven't read it. If someone had asked me yesterday, I'd have told them the Quebec Conference was made up of six professional hockey teams. But what I do know is that it's time for the President to run for president again. Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and I'm certain he's told the President exactly what I'd tell him: Nail down Michigan and California, where they make cars and airplanes -- and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if I had read these eight hundred pages, I would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the GDC is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration...
C: SUSAN
D: It's really time to--
E: to SYDNEY
C: SYDNEY
D: Susan, I promise you, the White House Chief of Staff will not let us leave here until he's broken the bad news.
N: No one in the room really understands what's going on... except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire SYDNEY but, of course, can't.
C: A.J.
D: I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although not about Michigan and California. The President has asked me to convey to you that he's sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of 10 percent.
E: pause
N: There's an uncomfortable silence in the room...
C: A.J.
D: The President is willing to go it alone on this, but he's asking for, and frankly he's expecting, the full support of the GDC.
E: continuing
C: SYDNEY
D: The President's expecting our full support?
C: A.J.
D: Yes, he is.
C: SYDNEY
D: The President's dreamin', A.J.
C: SUSAN
D: Sydney!
C: SYDNEY
D: --the President has critically misjudged reality. If he honestly thinks that the environmental community is going to whistle a happy tune while rallying support around this pitifully lame mockery of environmental leadership just because he's a nice guy and he's done better than his predecessors, then your boss is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.
C: VOICE
D: Let's take him out back and beat the shit out of him.
E: O.S.
N: SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in person, The President of the United States. She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on her head right now.
C: A.J.
D: Good morning, Mr. President. How are you today?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Couldn't be better. I apologize for the interruption, but A.J. asked me to stop and say hello. You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by any chance, would you?
E: to the GROUP
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President, I'm...don't know what to say. I'm speechless.
C: SHEPHERD
D: All evidence to the contrary.
C: SUSAN
D: Mr. President, we haven't met. My name is Susan Sloan. I used to work with Congressman Myers. I hope this episode in no way--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney?
C: SYDNEY
D: Yes, sir?
C: SHEPHERD
D: You got a second?
C: SYDNEY
D: Of course.
E: quietly
N: SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s office and into the hallway.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I thought maybe we might have a word in private. Someplace a little less intimidating. Janie?
E: calling
C: JANIE
D: Yes, sir.
C: SHEPHERD
D: This is my personal assistant, Janie Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms. Wade into the rec room. I'll be there in a second.
E: to SYDNEY
N: SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues down the hallway.
C: JANIE
D: This way...
E: to SYDNEY
N: JANIE leads SYDNEY into...
S: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
N: ...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of the United States, the bust of Lincoln... SHEPHERD strides in--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sorry to keep you waiting.
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Is it okay if I call you Sydney?
C: SYDNEY
D: Of course. Mr. President--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Have you ever been in the Oval Office?
C: SYDNEY
D: I've just been on the regular tour. It didn't include...
C: SHEPHERD
D: I hear it's pretty good.
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President, what you saw in there was nothing more than vanity run amok. I was showing off for a colleague who doesn't think very much of me. It'd be a real injustice for you to hold the GDC accountable for my behavior today. On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry for having insulted you like that.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Are you under the impression that I'm mad at you?
C: SYDNEY
D: Well...
E: pause
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney, seldom does a day go by that I'm not burned in effigy.
C: SYDNEY
D: Not by a professional political operative standing 30 feet from the Oval Office.
C: SHEPHERD
D: No, I'll give you that.
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Did you know that when the City Planners sat down to design Washington, D.C., their intention was to build a city that would intimidate and humble foreign heads of state? It's true.
C: SYDNEY
D: I didn't know that.
C: SHEPHERD
D: The White House has the single greatest home court advantage in the modern world.
C: SYDNEY
D: Learned that one the hard way.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney, this bill is important to me.
C: SYDNEY
D: Yes, sir, I'll convey your message.
C: SHEPHERD
D: But you don't believe me?
C: SYDNEY
D: The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.
C: SHEPHERD
D: It's not gonna pass at 20 percent. It's a long shot at 10.
C: SYDNEY
D: How do you know that until you put the full weight of the White House behind--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes shy in the House. It can't be done. But I tell you what. I'll make you a deal with you. If you can get 24 votes, I'll get you the last 10.
C: SYDNEY
D: Twenty-four votes?
C: SHEPHERD
D: If you can swing 24 votes by the State of the Union, I'll promise you full White House support.
C: SYDNEY
D: Do I have your word on that, sir?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry? I skipped breakfast. You wanna have some coffee? A donut or something?
C: SYDNEY
D: Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my surroundings, and yes, I've gotten off to a rocky and somewhat stilted beginning, but don't let that diminish the weight of my message: The GDC has been at every president for the last decade and a half that global warming is a calamity, the effects of which will be second only to nuclear war. The best scientists in the world have given you every reason to take the GDC seriously. But I'm gonna give you one more. If you don't live up to the deal you just made, come New Hampshire, we're gonna go shopping for a new candidate.
N: SYDNEY heads for the door--
C: SHEPHERD
D: You can't do that, Sydney.
C: SYDNEY
D: With all due respect, Mr. President, who's gonna stop me?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Well, if you go through that door, the United States Secret Service. That's my private office. You need to go out that way.
E: pointing
C: SYDNEY
D: Ah.
E: beat
N: SYDNEY, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the Oval Office. SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT
N: SHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second floor residence. His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is something he does almost as well as being President. A.J. stands to the side with his pool cue.
C: A.J.
D: McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know we're making our move on the crime bill. They're circling the wagons on the assault weapons.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Should I meet with them?
C: A.J.
D: Let Lewis take a pass at them first.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Fine. 2 in the side.
N: SHEPHERD sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket.
C: A.J.
D: Nice shot, Mr. President.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't call me by my name when we're playing pool.
N: A.J. assesses the table.
C: A.J.
D: I will not do it playing pool, I will not do it in a school, I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am.
C: SHEPHERD
D: At ease, A.J., and get away from the pocket. 9 in the corner.
N: SHEPHERD makes the shot.
C: A.J.
D: Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was thrilled with the deal you made this morning.
N: SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I forgot to tell you.
C: A.J.
D: It's a waste of time.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Not our time. GDC makes a big push for the votes, and when they come up short, we move in with the softer bill, to get passed, we're everybody's hero. 3 in the side.
C: A.J.
D: Also, Sydney Wade called.
N: SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney Wade?
C: A.J.
D: She wanted to apologize one more time for her behavior. 3 in the side.
E: beat
C: SHEPHERD
D: Did she say anything about me?
C: A.J.
D: Sydney Wade?
E: beat
C: SHEPHERD
D: When she called.
C: A.J.
D: Did she say anything about you? 13 in the corner.
C: SHEPHERD
D: No, it's just that we had a nice couple of minutes together. She threatened me and I patronized her and we didn't have anything to eat, but I thought there was a connection.
N: A.J. is staring at him in disbelief.
C: SHEPHERD
D: She didn't say anything about me?
C: A.J.
D: Well, no, but I could pass her a note before study hall and--
E: quietly
C: SHEPHERD
D: Tell me this: Hypothetically, what would happen--
C: A.J.
D: I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in the corner.
N: He misses the shot.
C: SHEPHERD
D: --if I called Sydney and asked her to be my date at the State Dinner Thursday night?
C: A.J.
D: You're not serious.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Don't I sound serious?
C: A.J.
D: The President can't just go out on a date.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.
C: A.J.
D: You're not--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Wilson was widowed during his first term. He meets a woman named Edith Gault. He dated her, courted her, married her, and somewhere in there managed to form the League of Nations.
C: A.J.
D: Mr. President, this is an election year. If you're looking for female companionship, we can make arrangements that'll insure total privacy and--
C: SHEPHERD
D: I don't want you to get me a girl, A.J. What is this, Vegas?
C: A.J.
D: No, sir, this is the White House.
C: SHEPHERD
D: And I'm talking about something that in no way is at conflict with my oath of office. I'm a single adult, and I met a woman that I'd like to see again socially. How's that different from what Wilson did?
C: A.J.
D: The difference is he didn't have to be the president on television. You've said it a million times: If there were a television set in every living room 60 years ago, this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair.
C: SHEPHERD
D: What are you saying?
C: A.J.
D: We'll take a hit.
C: SHEPHERD
D: How big?
C: A.J.
D: I don't know. Five points. Maybe more.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Five points we're standing here talking about?!
C: A.J.
D: It could be more.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I drop five points when Wisconsin doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl. 5 in the corner.
C: A.J.
D: Do you want me to have Kodak put together some numbers so we know what we're talking about?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Yeah. No. No. I don't want to check a polling sample to see if this is okay, like I'm asking permission to stay out an hour past curfew. This isn't the business of the American people.
E: beat
C: A.J.
D: Mr. President, the American people have a funny way of deciding on their own what is and what is not their business.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I like her, A.J. Stop being my chief of staff for one minute.
E: pause
C: A.J.
D: Give her a call.
E: beat
C: SHEPHERD
D: Janie! She didn't say anything about me?
E: calling out to A.J.
C: A.J.
D: She said you're taller than she thought you'd be.

N: Lined with red-brick, three-story walk-ups.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as evidence that SYDNEY's staying with her sister BETH temporarily. BETH, still in hospital scrubs from a 12-hour shift, opens a bottle of wine while SYDNEY, in a bathrobe and wet hair, tries to get off the phone.
C: SYDNEY
D: Richard...Richard, it wasn't funny. I acted like a college freshman at a protest rally.
E: into phone
C: BETH
D: Tell him the part about walking out the wrong door.

D: Oh God, I forgot about that. No, Richard...Richard, I don't want to hear your Andrew Shepherd imitation...
E: back into phone
C: BETH
D: I wanna hear it.
C: SYDNEY
D: I'm hanging up now, Richard... Tonight? I was gonna go to bed early and wake up when there's a new president.
N: She hangs up.
C: SYDNEY
D: The President must think I'm a third- rate jerk.
E: continuing
C: BETH
D: If he thinks you're a jerk, I'm sure he thinks you're a first-rate jerk.
C: SYDNEY
D: I'll tell you one thing, boy. I regrouped, you gotta gimme that. I pulled it together at the end. I stood in the middle of the Oval Office and I made it very clear that from now on, he who doesn't take the GDC seriously does so at his peril!
C: BETH
D: And then you walked out the wrong door.
C: SYDNEY
D: Are you gonna be throwing that back at me the rest of my life?
C: BETH
D: That's my current plan, yes.
N: The TELEPHONE RINGS...
C: SYDNEY
D: That's gonna be Leo Solomon. He said he'd call at nine.
N: SYDNEY picks up the phone--

N: SYDNEY doesn't recognize the voice--

D: Leo?
E: into phone

N: SYDNEY looks at BETH and rolls her eyes, then explains to her--
C: SYDNEY
D: Andrew Shepherd. You're hilarious, Richard. You're a regular riot.
E: back in the phone
N: And we CROSS-CUT between SYDNEY and SHEPHERD.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Uhh...this isn't Richard, it's Andrew Shepherd.
C: SYDNEY
D: Oh, really. Well, I'm so glad you called, because I forgot to tell you today what a nice ass you have. I'm also impressed that you were able to get my phone number, considering I don't have a phone. Good night, Richard.
N: SYDNEY hangs up the phone.

N: He's just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings. He picks up the phone--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Hello.
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President, I'm sure there's an appropriate thing to say at this moment. Probably some formal apology for the nice-ass remark would be in order. I just don't quite know how to word it.
C: SHEPHERD
D: It's my fault. I shouldn't have called you at home. Should I call you at the office tomorrow?
C: SYDNEY
D: No, sir, of course not. I mean -- yes, you can call me anytime you want -- this is fine. Right now is fine. When I said "of course not," I meat that...You know what? The hell with it -- I'm moving to another country.
C: SHEPHERD
D: What did you mean when you said you don't have a phone.
E: smiling
C: SYDNEY
D: I just moved to Washington over the weekend, and my apartment isn't ready yet. This is my sister's apartment. Come to think of it, how did you get this number?
C: SHEPHERD
D: How did I get the number. That's a reasonable question. I don't know. Probably the FBI.
E: beat
C: SYDNEY
D: The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want to find someone and you're the president, that's who you would call.
E: trying to pretend it's just another guy on the phone
C: SHEPHERD
D: You know who else is good at that?
C: SYDNEY
D: The C.I.A.?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the Internal Revenue Service. They have computer files that...Well...I should stop stalling. As I'm sure you know, the French have elected themselves a new president, and we're having a formal state dinner at the White House, and I was wondering -- and you're under no obligation at all -- but I thought it might be fun... I was wondering if you maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh... there it is. That's why I was calling.
N: There's a long silence on the phone.

E: beat
C: SYDNEY
D: No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what do I do? I, I mean, where do I go? Should I meet you? Will you...
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm gonna have a very nice woman named Marsha Bridgeport call you. She's the White House Social Director, and she'll help you with anything you want. Now when she calls you and tells you her name is Marsha Bridgeport, it'll help if you give her the benefit of the doubt.
C: SYDNEY
D: Of course.
C: SHEPHERD

N: A large conference room at OEOB has been converted for the use of a half-dozen STAFFERS as well as ten or twelve interns, some of them high school age. A sign on a corkboard reads, "17 Votes in 69 Days." The two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following numbers in descending order. There is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns: FOR, LEANING TOWARDS, UNDECIDED, LEANING AGAINST, and AGAINST.

D: I don't believe it. You. New guy. "Jarrett, Democrat, Minnesota." Slide his name on over to "for." We just had his name laminated under "Undecided." How'd you get the fence pole out of his butt?
E: to an INTERN to Lewis
C: LEWIS
D: I wish I could take credit. He just said, "Lewis, I support the President a hundred percent ." Not the bill, the President.
C: LEWIS
D: We're gonna win this in a walk. It's like a kissing booth at a carnival. Give us a vote, get a photo-op with number 63.

N: It's a beautiful night. The White House, lit up and shimmering in its golden glow, would appear now to be exactly what the poet was looking at when he described The Shining City on a Hill. Limousines, several of which fly the flag of foreign diplomats, pull up one by one, their doors opened by white- gloved MARINES. White lights from television cameras mix with the fireworks of flashbulbs from the print media.
S: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The GUESTS -- of whom there are a couple hundred -- in black tie and evening gowns, are entering the receiving area. All this happening, of course, under the eye of the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, both American and French, who are strategically placed throughout. The light from a TV camera comes on as a reporter begins a quick stand-up interview with ROBERT RUMSON, a handsome man in his late forties.
C: REPORTER
D: I'm standing here with Senate Minority Leader Robert Rumson, just one of the many guests arriving at what, for a few hours at least, is a non-partisan White House. Senator, the latest public opinion survey shows the President with approval ratings that would make him all but unbeatable, come next November. Is there a Republican who can mount a serious challenge, and are you that candidate?

E: affectionately
C: SYDNEY
D: I don't know what happened. One minute I was calling him a mockery of an environmental leader. The next minute I had a date.
C: ESTHER
D: Men like being insulted by women. It makes them feel loved. Don't ask me why.
C: A.J.
D: Sydney, when you meet the French President, don't make him feel too loved, all right? We just signed a new trade agreement.
C: SYDNEY
D: Got it.
N: The French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach.

D: Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt. The receiving line is in place.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney, it sounds like our table's ready.
N: SHEPHERD's guests make their way out of the residence, leaving SHEPHERD with SYDNEY and the FRENCH PRESIDENT and MDME. D'ASTIER.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
N: SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters the East Room. The GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so that the two of them can have some privacy.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Once we hit the bottom of the stairs, I gotta do a thing. You'll be escorted...
C: SYDNEY
D: They took me through it.
N: After a slight pause--
C: SYDNEY
D: Do you do this often, sir?
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: This is, actually, only our second State Dinner. The first was for the Emperor of Japan, who died shortly after that, so we stopped having them for a while, just in case.
E: beat
C: SYDNEY
D: I meant do you go out on...do you-- often--do you--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Do I date a lot?
C: SYDNEY
D: Well, yeah.
C: SHEPHERD
D: No. How 'bout you?
C: SYDNEY
D: Me? Lately, I seem to be going out on a lot of first dates.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Then you're experienced at this.
C: SYDNEY
D: Oh yeah, you can ask me anything.
C: SHEPHERD
D: How are we doing so far?
C: SYDNEY
D: It's hard to say at this point. So far it's just your typical first date stuff.
N: And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East Room-- --The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four ruffles and flourishes.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Damn. And I wanted to find a way to be different from the other guys.
N: A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces--
C: VOICE
D: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
E: O.S.
N: And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision --
C: SHEPHERD
D: By the way, nice shoes.
N: --SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF. The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud. The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite swept up.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. EAST ROOM - NIGHT
N: The room is beautifully appointed, with the Marine Corps Dance Band playing dinner music -- and the SECRET SERVICE strategically positioned.
T: CUT TO:
N: AT SHEPHERD'S TABLE STEWARDS are clearing away the main course and refilling wine glasses. In addition to the two main couples, and ESTHER MacINERNEY and TWO OTHER COUPLES are seated at the President's table.
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President, the President and Mrs. D'Astier look bored. They're not talking to anybody.
C: SHEPHERD
D: They're hammered. Esther, do you speak French?
C: ESTHER
D: Latin.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I thought you spoke French.
C: ESTHER
D: No, Latin.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Great, next time Julius Caesar comes to town, you're our gal. Sydney, I don't suppose that you speak any--
C: SYDNEY
D: Monsieur le President, nous sommes tous habilles, nous avons ce merveilleux orchestre, une piece magnifique...comment se fait-il que les invites ne dansent pas?
E: taking over-- to D'Astier
C: SHEPHERD
D: That's my date.
E: proudly to A.J. and Esther
C: D'ASTIER
D: Je ne connais pas la tradition en Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les invites de Louis XVI et Marie Antoinette avaient ose danser devant le roi et la reine, ils auraient perdu la tete.
C: SYDNEY
D: Really?
C: MADAME D'ASTIER
D: Absolument.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney, you didn't dissolve the NATO treaty, did you?
C: SYDNEY
D: I just said that we're sitting in this beautiful room, listening to the music of this wonderful orchestra, and I wondered why nobody was dancing.
C: D'ASTIER
D: And I informed Ms. Wade that in my country, a guest at the palace of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would soon find their head in a guillotine if they made the impertinent gesture of dancing without so much as a by-your-leave from the King and the Queen.
C: A.J.
D: I'll bet no one accused Louis of being soft on crime.
C: SYDNEY
D: There's a lesson there, Mr. President.
C: SHEPHERD
D: More beheadings at the White House?
C: A.J.
D: Bob Rumson would embrace it.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm sure he would, but I have a better idea.
N: SHEPHERD stands, holds out his hand to SYDNEY.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Would you like to dance?
E: continuing
C: SYDNEY
D: Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, yes, sir, I'd love to.
N: SHEPHERD and SYDNEY move to the dance floor, accompanied by the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the GUESTS. The dance band begins, and SYDNEY and SHEPHERD dance... ...beautifully.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE GUESTS each and every one of them, have stopped all conversation and are fixating on this captivating sight. As we go around the room, we can observe the subtle reactions of, at first, various anonymous GUESTS, then
T: CUT TO:
N: A.J. AND ESTHER MACINERNEY, holding hands smiling as they watch their old friend, and we
T: CUT TO:
N: RUMSON'S TABLE where the Minority Leader's game face can barely conceal the gears that have slowly begun to turn in his head, as we
T: CUT TO:
N: SHEPHERD AND SYDNEY DANCING
C: SYDNEY
D: I don't know how you do it.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Arthur Murray. Six lessons.
C: SYDNEY
D: That's not what I mean. Two hundred pairs of eyes are focused on you right now, with two questions: "Who's this girl, and why's our president dancing with her?"
C: SHEPHERD
D: First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes aren't focused on me. They're focused on you. And the answers are "Sydney Ellen Wade" and "Because she said 'yes.'"
N: LEWIS AND ROBIN looking on from the back of the room.
C: LEWIS
D: They make a nice couple.
C: ROBIN
D: Lovely.
C: LEWIS
D: We've got troubles.
C: ROBIN
D: Huge.
N: As PEOPLE start onto dance floor, we
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. A BLACK LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
N: as it pulls away from the White House and into the night. In the back, SYDNEY slips a shoe off and rubs her foot. She smiles, then turns around to look out the back window as the White House slips out of view.

N: MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE are at their respective desks as SHEPHERD walks in.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Good morning, Mrs. Chapil.
C: MRS. CHAPIL
D: Good morning, Mr. President. Mr. Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the office, sir. They said they needed to speak with you before scheduling.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Fine. Janie, can you get me the number of a local florist?
C: JANIE
D: I'll take care of it, sir. Where do you want them sent?
C: SHEPHERD
D: I want to do it myself. I just need the phone number.
C: JANIE
D: I don't understand.
C: SHEPHERD

E: beat
C: SHEPHERD
D: I want to send some flowers, Janie. I want to do it myself. I don't want to staff it out, and I don't want to issue an Executive Order. I just want a phone number.

E: to Robin
N: JANIE enters and hands SHEPHERD a piece of paper.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Thank you, Janie.
E: continuing
N: She exits.
C: LEWIS
D: Who are we calling, sir?
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm calling the Organization of the United Brotherhood of It's-None-of- Your-Damn-Business, Lewis. I'll be with you in a minute.
C: LEWIS
D: Yes, sir.
N: LEWIS and ROBIN exit the Oval Office. SHEPHERD picks up the phone.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Yeah, good morning. How do I get an outside line? Really? That's simple. Thank you.
E: to the OPERATOR
N: SHEPHERD dials the phone number JANIE's given him.
T: CUT TO:
N: LEWIS and ROBIN hovering near the outer office.
C: LEWIS
D: Janie?
C: JANIE
D: Yes?

N: OVAL OFFICE
C: JANIE
D: Sir, it's a tree and a flower.

E: O.S.
T: CUT TO:
N: SHEPHERD AT HIS DESK
C: JANIE
D: They're in storage in Wisconsin with the rest of your personal items.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Ah. Listen, what might be better is if you just bill me for the flowers. I'm sure it'll be okay with your boss. Well, I don't know if you recognize my voice, but this is the President. The United States. Hello, hello...

S: INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: SYDNEY enters.
C: SYDNEY
D: Leo, you wanted to see me?
C: LEO
D: So there I was, thinking maybe I should give Sydney a call. She's new in town, doesn't know many people...
N: LEO produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo of SHEPHERD and SYDNEY dancing.
C: SYDNEY
D: Leo--
C: LEO
D: Then I picked up the Times--
C: SYDNEY
D: It was crazy. He called me at home.
C: LEO
D: What's going on?
C: SYDNEY
D: Nothing. It was innocent. His cousin got the flu at the last minute.
C: LEO
D: Did you sleep with him?
C: SYDNEY
D: What?
C: LEO
D: Did you sleep--
C: SYDNEY
D: That's none of your business, Leo.
C: LEO
D: Yeah, it is, Sydney.
C: SYDNEY
D: You wanna tell me how my personal life in any way--
C: LEO
D: Because when it's the President, it's not personal. Sydney, I hired your reputation. I hired a pit bull, not a prom queen.
C: SYDNEY
D: That's unfair.
C: LEO
D: It's incredibly unfair. But you've spent a lot of time over the year telling me the trouble with the environmental lobby is that we don't understand the fundamental truth that politics is perception. This is a bad time to develop ignorance.
C: SYDNEY
D: You're making way too much of this.
C: LEO
D: Am I? This is your time, Sydney. You're sitting at the grown-ups' table. You have a chance to get everything you want -- run a national campaign, be a major player inside the party. But this relationship had better go all the way, because with the leader of the free world there is no halfway. Politics is perception, and if thing don't work out, the amount of time it'll take you to go from being a hired gun to a cocktail party joke can be clocked with an egg timer.
N: There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in with a strange-looking package.
C: SYDNEY
D: Leo, there is no relationship. It was one night. It's done.
C: LEO'S SECRETARY
D: Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered by White House messenger. It's marked "Perishable."
C: LEO
D: The White House has sent me something perishable?
C: LEO'S SECRETARY
D: It's for Ms. Wade.
C: LEO
D: Here we go...
N: SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package.
C: SYDNEY
D: Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a formality.
C: LEO'S SECRETARY
D: It's from him.
E: exited
C: LEO
D: Of course it's from him.
C: SYDNEY
D: So he had some staff flunky send me a fruit basket.
C: LEO'S SECRETARY
D: He wrote the note himself.
C: SYDNEY
D: I'm sure he didn't take the time to--
C: LEO'S SECRETARY
D: The messenger said he was waiting in the Oval Office for ten minutes while the President wrote the card.
C: SYDNEY
D: Okay, listen, so he-- --it took him ten minutes to write a card?!
E: to LEO'S SECRETARY
C: LEO'S SECRETARY
D: Apparently he went through several drafts.
N: SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is.
C: LEO
D: What is it...what is it?
C: SYDNEY
D: A ham.
C: LEO
D: A ham?
E: beat
C: SYDNEY
D: He sent me a Virginia ham.
C: LEO'S SECRETARY
D: Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the President's girlfriend.
N: SYDNEY's smile fades away...she looks at LEO.
C: LEO
D: There's never an egg timer around when you need one.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
N: SHEPHERD is conferring with LEWIS and ROBIN.
C: ROBIN
D: Sir, they're gonna be pressing today about whether the White House is prepared to soften the assault weapons section of the crime bill.
C: LEWIS
D: There is no need to entertain that at this point.
C: ROBIN
D: How do you want me to handle the Sydney issue?
C: SHEPHERD
D: The Sydney issue?
C: LEWIS
D: We should have a consensus on how the White House is going to handle it.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I sure hope the Sydney issue refers in some way to a problem we're having with Australia, because if it's anything else...
N: JANIE pokes her head in.
C: JANIE
D: Mr. President, Ms. Wade is here to see you.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Tell her she can come right in. I'm finished here.
C: JANIE
D: Yes, sir.
C: SHEPHERD
D: There is no Sydney issue.
E: to LEWIS and ROBIN
N: SYDNEY enters, crossing paths with LEWIS and ROBIN. They exchange pleasantries.
C: SYDNEY
D: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
E: to SHEPHERD
C: SHEPHERD
D: No problem. Did you get the ham?
C: SYDNEY
D: I got the ham, yes. Thank you very much.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I wanted to send you flowers, but there seem to be some kinks in the system. I'm really glad you stopped by. I had such a good time last night.
C: SYDNEY
D: So did I. It's just that...
N: JANIE enters.
C: JANIE
D: They're 45 seconds away, sir.
N: During the following, JANIE will go to the desk, pick up two briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm delivering a luncheon speech at the Governor's Conference this morning. I'm sorry to--
C: SYDNEY
D: No, no, that's fine. I just stopped by to...
C: SHEPHERD
D: Are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
C: SYDNEY
D: Dinner?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Casual. In the Residence. Without the United Nations. My daughter'll be with us, so it may seem like the United--
C: SYDNEY
D: I'd love to meet Lucy, but...
N: An AIDE has slipped in and hands SHEPHERD a note.
C: SHEPHERD
D: She's gonna like you. Excuse me -- Jeff!
E: reading to himself as he talks SYDNEY calling to the AIDE
C: SYDNEY
D: Actually, I have some concerns that--
N: The AIDE (JEFF) steps back in--
C: JEFF
D: Yes, sir.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I can't do this.
E: reading the note
C: JEFF
D: Which? Robbins or Stackhouse?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Either one. I have to be in and out.
C: JEFF
D: Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just needed 10 minutes. I think he wants to talk about the assault weapons.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Stackhouse wants to talk about grazing rights. Trust me.
C: JEFF
D: Got it.
N: And he's gone.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sorry. You have concerns.
E: to Sydney
C: SYDNEY
D: Yes. Not many. A few. One. I have one concern.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Does it having anything to do with one of us being the President?
C: SYDNEY
D: You like to make jokes about this, but--
C: SHEPHERD
D: I am not mocking you, honest. I'm just a guy asking a girl over for a meal.
N: And, as if from out of nowhere, a LOUD CLAAAMMERING, like the sound of a jackhammer against cement, comes from somewhere outside -- growing louder and closer --
C: SYDNEY
D: What's that?
C: SHEPHERD
D: My ride's here.
N: And, sure enough, coming into view outside the windows of the Oval Office, is MARINE-1, the President's helicopter. JANIE comes back in and helps him on with his coat and scarf.
C: SYDNEY
D: Leo Solomon has serious concerns about my exploring a social, you know, scenario, with the President of the United States.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Yeah, well, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound that great to me either.
C: SYDNEY
D: It's just not--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Have dinner with Lucy and me. It's meat loaf night -- how presidential can it be?
N: As SHEPHERD rushes out...
C: SHEPHERD
D: Seven-thirty.

E: standing up, smiling
C: LUCY
D: Lucy Shepherd.
C: SYDNEY
D: Nice to meet you.
C: LUCY
D: My dad told me to tell you he's on the phone with his dentist and that I should behave myself and entertain you till he gets here.
C: SYDNEY
D: Your father's on the phone with his dentist?
C: LUCY
D: No. He told me to tell you he's on the phone with his dentist. He wants you to think he's a regular guy.
C: SYDNEY
D: Who is he on the phone with?
C: LUCY
D: The Prime Minister of Israel.
C: SYDNEY
D: They're probably not discussing his teeth.
C: LUCY
D: No. They're talking about that abbreviation I can never remember.
C: SYDNEY
D: C-STAD?
C: LUCY
D: Yeah.
C: SYDNEY
D: Capricorn Surface To Air Defense.

D: Everything all right with your teeth?
C: SHEPHERD
D: My teeth?
C: SYDNEY
D: The dentist.
C: SHEPHERD

S: INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: The look and feel of old money. Rumson is holding court with a half-dozen political insiders. Some smoke cigars; others sip their drinks.

D: Voters aren't interested in how to achieve economic growth, and they don't want to hear our plans to strengthen foreign policy.
E: continuing
N: STAFFER #1 So it comes down to character. STAFFER #2 The press like him, Senator. The networks, the newspapers, they're--
C: RUMSON
D: Reporters like him. Networks and newspapers like ratings and circulation. For all the bitching we do about liberal bias in the press when it comes down to a character debate...
N: STAFFER #3 The press is an unwitting accomplice.
C: CARL
D: Bob, the character debate didn't work out for us.
C: RUMSON
D: Because it couldn't. Our polling told us that attacking his character less than a year after he'd lost his wife was gonna be a turn-off and was gonna make people feel sorry for him. We couldn't run the campaign we wanted because the opponent was a widower.
C: CARL
D: He's still a widower. Time's passed, but--
C: RUMSON
D: You'll have to forgive my friend. He's been on a hunting trip and cut off from the world.
E: to the rest

D: What's going on?

D: Dad--

D: You're not having fun?
C: LUCY
D: This is a nightmare. This is a social studies nightmare.
E: to herself
C: SHEPHERD
D: They're doing a mock Congress. Each kid is playing one of the original delegates, and they debate the Amendments. Now what's not fun about that?
N: LUCY gets up from the table and kisses her father.

N: This is the "museum" area of the White House, the part you see when you take the official tour. Only a few lights are lit, and while the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS give SHEPHERD plenty of breathing room when he's in the residence, we'll still catch a glimpse of one of them rounding a corner in the distance or checking a doorway ahead.
C: SYDNEY
D: I thought C-STAD wasn't gonna be operational until January.
C: SHEPHERD
D: It was ready ahead of schedule. We've just been waiting for the personnel.
C: SYDNEY
D: The Israelis?
C: SHEPHERD
D: No, our guys. We've sent a team of Army instructors to train the Israelis.
N: SYDNEY and SHEPHERD enter the:
S: INT. THE CHINA ROOM - NIGHT
N: Named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full place settings of the official White House china and silverware from every administration since Jackson.
C: SHEPHERD:
D: I think this is the dish room.
E: remembering
C: SYDNEY
D: It's not the dish--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Yeah, it is. It's the room with all the dishes.
C: SYDNEY
D: It's the China Room.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm more of a West Wing President. If you're curious about the mansion, there's probably a book you can get--
C: SYDNEY
D: There're about seven-thousand books. I'll get one for you.
N: SYDNEY's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows, she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of incredibly flattering moonlight. The vision isn't lost on SHEPHERD. They stare at each other for a moment.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney.
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President -- have you ever noticed how similar the Van Buren flatware is to the Buchanan flatware?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Do you think there will ever come a time when you can stand in a room with me and not think of me as the President?
C: SYDNEY
D: This isn't a state of mind. You are the President. And when I'm in a room with you, oval or any other shape, I'm always gonna be a lobbyist, and you'll always be the President.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I got news for you, Sydney. As a lobbyist, you would never be alone in a room with the President.
N: This last statement is not lost on SYDNEY. He moves toward her until they are both bathed in the moonlight. He puts his arms around her.
C: SYDNEY
D: You think this is a good idea?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Probably not.
N: They lean in to kiss each other. They barely make contact when... AGENT #3 (O.S.) Mr. President... An AGENT is standing in the doorway -- SHEPHERD and SYDNEY break apart. AGENT #3 We have a secure call from the sit- room. SHEPHERD knows what that means.

D: What time does the night crew go on?
C: DEPUTY
D: They're on now, sir.
C: SHEPHERD
D: A.J.?
C: A.J.
D: It's immediate, it's decisive, it's low risk, and it's a proportional response.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Someday somebody's going to have to explain to me the virtue of a proportional response.

C: LEWIS
D: General Rork says around O-Eight Hundred.
C: ROBIN
D: Sir, what do you think about a national address?
C: SHEPHERD
D: The last thing I want to do is put the Lybians center stage.
C: KODAK
D: I think it's a great idea, sir. You know Rumson's gonna be talking about your lack of military service.
C: SHEPHERD
D: This isn't about Rumson. What I did tonight was not about political gain.
C: KODAK
D: But it can be, sir. What you did tonight was very presidential.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now there's a janitor working the night shift at the Libyan Intelligence Headquarters. He's going about his job 'cause he has no idea that in about an hour he's gonna die in a massive explosion. He's just going about his job 'cause he has no idea that an hour ago I gave an order to have him killed. You just saw me do the least presidential thing I do.

C: SALLY
D: Is there anything at all about the C-STAD weapons system that could have been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence as offensive rather than defensive?
C: SHEPHERD
D: No. We did everything but show them the blueprints. The hardware was sitting in a airplane hangar for a month. They didn't hit it until the
N: American personnel got there. Leslie.

C: BETH
D: It's always something.
C: SYDNEY
D: I've gotta nip this in the bud. This has catastrophe written all over it.
C: BETH
D: In what language?! Sydney, this man is the leader of the free world. He's brilliant, he's funny, he's handsome, and he's an above-average dancer. Isn't it possible our standards are just a tad high?

N: But SYDNEY doesn't take her coat off.
C: SYDNEY
D: Mr. President, this isn't gonna work.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sure it will. You button the top button, and it doesn't fall off the hanger.
C: SYDNEY
D: That's not what I...
C: SHEPHERD
D: I didn't think so. Listen...
C: SYDNEY
D: I've really enjoyed the time we've spent together, but this has catastrophe written all over it. Please, Mr. President, don't pursue me outside the political arena.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Well, I have no intention of pursuing you inside the political arena, so that leaves everything out, and that's unacceptable to me.
C: SYDNEY
D: If I were on your staff, I would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character attacks, and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the Western world.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Let's clear up a couple of things. Number 1: I seldom prance. Number 2: I have no intention of engaging in a character debate, and Number 3: You're not on my staff.
C: SYDNEY
D: Yes, of course, but if you'll follow the immutable--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Why is that, by the way?
C: SYDNEY
D: Why's that?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Why aren't you on my staff?
C: SYDNEY
D: You can't afford me.
C: SHEPHERD
D: How much do you make?
C: SYDNEY

C: SHEPHERD
D: The name's Andy. How much money do you make?
C: SYDNEY
D: What the hell does it matter how much money I--
C: SHEPHERD
D: You would raise your voice to the President?
C: SYDNEY
D: I'm only thinking about the health of your Presidency. You think this morning's press conference was the end of it? Bob Rumson's gotta be drooling over this.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Are you attracted to me?
C: SYDNEY
D: I beg your pardon?
C: SHEPHERD
D: I asked if--
C: SYDNEY
D: That's not the issue--
E: of course she is
C: SHEPHERD
D: Well, I tell you what. Let's make it the issue. Let's try something new, 'cause I know that most couples, when they're first getting together, are inclined to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about Bob Rumson's drool.
C: SYDNEY
D: You're not most people.
C: SHEPHERD
D: You know what your problem is?
C: SYDNEY
D: What's my problem?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sex and nervousness.
C: SYDNEY
D: Sex and nervousness is my problem.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Yes. Last night when we were looking at the different place settings in the dish room, I realized that those place settings were provided by the First Ladies. And I'll bet none of those First Ladies were nervous about having sex with their President husbands. And you know why?
C: SYDNEY
D: No, but I'm sure you'll explain it to me.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I will. Because they weren't presidents when they met them. Not the case here.
C: SYDNEY
D: Ahhhhhh.
C: SHEPHERD
D: You see what I'm getting at?
C: SYDNEY
D: Yes. May I use your bathroom for a moment?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sure. It's right through there.
C: SYDNEY
D: I want to freshen up.
C: SHEPHERD
D: As you pass through, you'll see a large closet on your left. And if you feel comfortable, hang up your coat, and when you come back I'll have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on the couch, and I will explain to you my plan.
C: SYDNEY
D: You have a plan? Don't make me wait. You're on a roll.
N: SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area. SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a couple of drinks.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Okay. You're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the President. It's not always gonna be that way, and the reason I know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the President, and I know what a big step that was for you. So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's my plan: We're gonna slow down. When you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen.
E: speaking up
N: SYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of SHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward him.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Perhaps I didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the "Slow Down" plan.
E: continuing
C: SYDNEY
D: You explained it great.
N: She moves closer to him.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Are you nervous?
E: pause
C: SYDNEY
D: No.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Good. My nervousness exists on several levels. Number 1 -- and this is in no particular order -- I haven't done this in a pretty long time. Number 2: Any expectations you might have, due to the fact that I'm, you know...
C: SYDNEY
D: The most powerful man in the world?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Exactly, thank you. Just so you remember that's a political distinction that comes with the office. I mean, if Eisenhower were here instead of me he'd be dead by now. And number three...
C: SYDNEY
D: Andy...
E: gently
N: They're both standing, facing each other... They gently kiss. They just stay with it until it becomes easier and better and exactly what they want.

C: SYDNEY
D: Hi.
C: SHEPHERD
D: What are you doing?
C: SYDNEY
D: I wanted to leave the building before the press corps got here.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I have those same thoughts every day of my life. Say, you know Lewis Rothschild, don't you? Well, he's...
C: SYDNEY
D: Sure. Boy, Lewis'd go nuts if he knew I'd spent the night.
N: There's a KNOCK on the door.
C: SHEPHERD

C: SHEPHERD

N: A.J. KNOCKS on the open door and walks in.
C: A.J.

C: LEWIS
D: How do we exit Sydney from the building and what do we say to the press at that point?
C: ROBIN
D: We need a diversion.
C: SYDNEY
D: A diversion.
C: ROBIN
D: You understand that by diversion I'm not saying we set the White House on fire.
C: SHEPHERD
D: No, please, let's do.
C: LEWIS
D: Can I state very clearly that I can't be party to anything illegal.
C: A.J.
D: Good for you, Lewis.

C: LEWIS
D: Okay. Good. Now, the press statement.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Sydney, when you leave here, you're gonna run into reporters and photographers. Your picture's gonna be taken every day, and you're gonna be asked questions every day. Answer them, don't answer them -- it's entirely up to you. The White House has no official position except to say "no comment."
E: to SYDNEY
C: ROBIN
D: No comment?
C: SHEPHERD
D: The White House doesn't comment on the President's personal life.

N: NEWS ANCHOR #2 (on T.V.) While the President spent the day at Camp David, G.O.P. presidential hopeful Robert Rumson continued his attacks on President Shepherd's character. During the Saturday morning news program Capitol Review with Kenneth Michaels, Senator Rumson suggested that GDC political director Sydney Ellen Wade, whose personal relationship with the President has been causing the White House headaches over the past two months, may have traded sexual favors for key votes in the Virginia State Legislature while lobbying for the Virginia Teachers Association.

D: I'm not asking you to. I can take care of myself. This isn't about me. How can you keep quiet? How do you have patience for people who claim they love America but clearly can't stand Americans?
C: SHEPHERD
D: I have one more election left, Sydney. I don't have the luxury of losing my patience.
C: SYDNEY
D: I want to say something, but I'm gonna fumble it a little bit, so I'd just like you to wait till I'm done before you respond. I'm in love with you. I'm certain of it. And I want to be with you more than anything. But maybe things would be better for you if I disappeared for a while.

D: No, the GDC's political director didn't tell us anything. Sydney Wade told her boyfriend and her boyfriend's best friend that she had a lousy day.

N: KODAK sits at his desk staring at a computer printout. LEWIS is nearing the end of a phone conversation that isn't going well. He's pacing around with the phone...desperate and intense. The tote board reads: "1 Vote in 2 Days." ROBIN enters.
C: ROBIN
D: How're the numbers?
E: to KODAK
C: KODAK
D: Bad.
C: ROBIN
D: How bad?
C: KODAK
D: Forty-one. Character across the board.
C: ROBIN
D: Who is Lewis on with?
C: KODAK
D: Jarrett. He's trying to keep his finger in the dam.
C: LEWIS
D: You're supposed to be a United States Congressman, for the love of Christ.
E: into phone
N: ROBIN and KODAK appear in the doorway, sensing a surprise development. LEWIS is losing it on the phone.
C: LEWIS
D: But you're not gonna stay at 41. The numbers are gonna be go back up. But they're gonna go back up. George... Congressman... Congressman Jarrett... George, it's crunch time. It's personal. This is one of those moments. It's just you and the President. Now that's it gonna be?
E: continuing; listens listens listens listens listens listens
N: LEWIS looks over at ROBIN and KODAK ...his face telling the story.
C: LEWIS
D: Yeah. Yeah. Hey, George? Can I tell you something? We're gonna win this thing. We're gonna get the votes and we're gonna win. And after we do, I mean that very night, I'm gonna go to Sam & Harry's, I'm gonna order a big steak, and I'm gonna make a list of everybody who tried to fuck us this week.

D: Lewis!

C: LEWIS
D: Vote your conscience, you chicken- shit, lame-ass--
E: into phone
N: LEWIS hangs up the phone. He takes a deep breath, slumps down in the nearest chair, and looks up at ROBIN and KODAK. There's a long silence before LEWIS says--
C: LEWIS
D: We lost Jarrett.
E: continuing
C: KODAK
D: I hope so. 'Cause, you know, if that was an "undecided," then we need to work on our people skills.
E: beat
N: LEWIS picks up the phone and punches in a few numbers. Even before that line starts ringing, he picks up another phone and punches in a different set of numbers.

D: Karen, it's Lewis. Could you hunt down Congressman Quincy for me. I need to talk to him right way.

D: We lost Quincy, too.

D: Did he give a reason?
C: LEWIS
D: He thinks your numbers aren't likely to rebound.
C: KODAK
D: We're three votes down again, sir.
N: There's a pause before ...
C: KODAK
D: Mr. President, as of this morning, Sydney only needed one more vote. The Motown Three have gotta be scared blind. I don't think there'll be a better opportunity.
E: continuing
C: ROBIN
D: The press is expecting an announcement on the crime bill by the Sate of the Union.
C: KODAK
D: If you agree to stick 455 in a drawer until after the elections, they'll give you the three votes.
C: ROBIN
D: And we declare victory, sir.
E: beat
C: SHEPHERD
D: We said as a last resort.
C: KODAK
D: We're there, sir. The State of the Union is 48 hours away.
C: SHEPHERD
D: No. Come on. There's gotta be three votes someplace else.
C: KODAK
D: There isn't.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Bullshit, Leon. There's gotta be somebody we haven't--
C: KODAK
D: There isn't, sir.

D: I beg your pardon?
C: SHEPHERD
D: What about Storch?

N: SHEPHERD is stopped.
C: A.J.
D: Mr. President, I think we have to do it.
C: SHEPHERD
D: She is one vote away, A.J. It's important legislation that for the first time has a legitimate chance. I think she deserves every possible opportunity to--
C: LEWIS
D: She? You meant "it," didn't you, sir? You meant the "important legislation" deserves every opportunity.
C: A.J.
D: Lewis, shut up.
N: There's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has locked eyes with LEWIS.
C: SHEPHERD
D: You got something to say to me?
C: LEWIS
D: Respectfully, sir. I think we should examine the new poll for more than its value as a box score.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Examine what? They don't like that I'm going out with Sydney.
C: LEWIS
D: It's not that simple, sir. I think this poll helps bribg a murky problem into specific relief.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Whose problem we talking about, Lewis? Yours? You worried about your job? This poll isn't talking about my Presidency. This poll is talking about my life. Two hundred and sixty-four million people have decided--
C: LEWIS
D: Mr. President, two hundred and sixty- four million people don't give a damn about your life. They give a damn about their own.
C: A.J.
D: All right, that's enough.
C: LEWIS
D: Mr. President, you've raised a daughter almost entirely on your own, and she's terrific. What does it say to you that in the last seven weeks, 59 percent of this country has begun to question your family values?
C: A.J.
D: The President doesn't answer to you, Lewis.
C: LEWIS
D: Oh yes, he does, A.J. I'm a citizen, this is my president, and in this country it is not only permissible to question our leaders, it is our responsibility. But you already know that, Mr. President, because you have a deeper love of this country than any man I've ever known, and I want to know what it says to you that in the past seven weeks 59 percent of Americans have begun to question your patriotism?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Look, if people want to listen to Bob Rumson--
C: LEWIS
D: They don't have a choice! Rob Rumson's the only one doing the talking. People want leadership. And in the absence of genuine leadership, they will listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone. They want leadership, Mr. President. They're so thirsty for it, they'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand.
C: SHEPHERD
D: Lewis, we've had Presidents who were beloved, who couldn't find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight. People don't drink the sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis. They drink it 'cause they don't know the difference.
E: evenly

C: SUSAN
D: I want to go on the record and apologize for my attitude toward you since your arrival.
C: SYDNEY
D: I didn't notice. Was there an attitude?
N: A PHONE RINGS, and one of the staffers takes it. SYDNEY tries to rejoin the party, but--
C: SUSAN
D: I think I have a lot of pent-up hostility.
C: SYDNEY
D: Well--
C: SUSAN
D: I wonder who I can blame it on.
C: SYDNEY
D: I'm not really qualified to--

N: SYDNEY comes out.
C: SYDNEY
D: Have you seen a gray cableknit sweater?
C: SHEPHERD

N: SYDNEY continues her search.
C: SYDNEY

D: Yes. Do you know if it was sent with your dry cleaning by any--
C: SHEPHERD
D: What's in Connecticut?
C: SYDNEY
D: Richard Reynolds' campaign. He may be able to get me a job.
C: SHEPHERD
D: When did you decide to get a new job?
C: SYDNEY
D: Not long after Leo Solomon fired me from my old one. Beth's gonna kill me. She loves that--
C: SHEPHERD
D: Why did he fire you?
C: SYDNEY
D: Total failure to achieve any of the objectives for which I was hired. I told him he was being unreasonable. After all, I did get to dance with the President and ride in Air Force One a couple of times. But you know those prickly environmentalists. It's always gonna be something with them. If it's not clean air, then it's clean water. Like it isn't good enough that I'm on the cover of People Magazine.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'll call him.
C: SYDNEY
D: You'll call him? You mean you'll call him yourself? Personally? It'll come from the President? That's a great idea. I think you should call Leo and make a deal. He hires me back for, say, 72 days. I go around scaring the hell out of Congress, making them think that the President's about to drive through a very damaging and costly bill. They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm the President's Friday Night Girl. Now I don't know if you can dip into this well twice, especially since I've lost all credibility in politics, but you never know, I might just be able to pull it off again. I might be able to give you just the leverage you need to pass some ground-breaking piece of crime legislation -- like a mandatory three-day waiting period before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi. Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to learn to live with disappointment.
N: She starts to exit
C: SHEPHERD
D: What do you think went on here today?
N: She stops.
C: SYDNEY
D: I know exactly what went on here today. I got screwed. You saw the poll, you needed the crime bill, you couldn't get it on your own, so I got screwed.
N: SHEPHERD The environment got screwed. Nothing happened to you today, Sydney. Governing is choosing. Governing is prioritizing. I've made no secret of the fact that the crime bill was my top priority.
C: SYDNEY
D: Well then, congratulations. It's only taken you three years to put together crime prevention legislation that has no hope of preventing crime.

D: Has Rumson lied in the last seven weeks?
C: A.J.
D: Has he lied?
C: SHEPHERD
D: Other than not knowing the difference between Harvard and Stanford, has he said something that isn't true? Am I not a Commander-in-Chief who's never served in the military? Am I not opposed to a Constitutional amendment banning flag burning? Am I not an unmarried father who was sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist down the hall from my twelve-year-old daughter?

C: SHEPHERD
D: What do you mean?

N: It just starts spilling out in a stream--
C: LUCY
D: Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean, I'm not sure. You know a lot more than I do -- but still, I have these feelings, and I don't think they're wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm not so sure it's all right to burn a flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot of people, and I don't know why you think it's okay. I hear Senator Rumson talk, and some of the things he says sounds right to me, and I think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?! I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad hates this guy! Why am I agreeing with him" And then I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not like Dad either." But the point is I'm the President's kid, and people pay attention to what I say, and if I say something different from what you say, it'll be embarrassing for you. So I can't just get up in social studies class and say whatever I want.
N: SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely no idea... He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know what's coming...

N: SHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands, and gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and holds her in a tight embrace...
C: SHEPHERD
D: In your lifetime, you will never embarrass me. It could never happen. You're not the President's daughter, Lucy, you're mine. And no one's gonna vote me out of that job. You're my daughter, and everything else is a distant second. School is for you, Lucy. You say what you want. The only thing you have to do to make me happy is come home at the end of the day.
E: continuing more
N: LUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a long moment.
C: SHEPHERD
D: One more thing. I don't dislike Senator Rumson because of his political views. And even if you voted for everything he would vote for, that wouldn't make you like him. There's a fundamental difference between you and the Bob Rumsons of the world.
E: continuing
C: LUCY
D: What's that?

C: SHEPHERD
D: Yes, he will. 'Morning.
C: ROBIN
D: Good morning, Mr. President.
N: SHEPHERD takes the podium. There's a palpable BUZZ in the room as video operators adjust their equipment, etc. People starts to stand.
C: SHEPHERD
D: That's all right, you can keep your seats. For the last couple of months, Senator Rumson has suggested that being president of this country was, to a certain extent, about character...
N: ANGLE - ROBIN who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in four numbers. She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the rest of the room.

E: into phone
C: SHEPHERD
D: ...and although I have not been willing to engage in his attacks on me, I've been here three years and three days, and I can tell you without hesitation: Being President of this country is entirely about character.
N: LEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.
C: SHEPHERD
D: For the record: Yes, I am a card- carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But the more important question is why aren't you, Bob? This is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the Bill of Rights, so it naturally begs the questions.
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: Why would a senator, his party's most powerful spokesman and a candidate for president, choose to reject upholding the Constitution? If you can answer that question, then, folks, you're smarter than I am, because I didn't understand it until a couple of minutes ago. Everybody knows American isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship.
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say, "You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating, at the top of his lungs, that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free, then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest." Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free. I've known Bob Rumson for years. I've been operating under the assumption that the reason Bob devotes so much time and energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it. Bob's problem is that he can't sell it. Nobody has ever won an election by talking about what I was just talking about.
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: This is a country made up of people with hard jobs that they're terrified of losing. The roots of freedom are of little or no interest to them at the moment. We are a nation afraid to go out at night. We're a society that has assigned low priority to education and has looked the other way while our public schools have been decimated. We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious men to solve them. And whatever your particular problem is, friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: Making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections. You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle- income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and personal character. Then you have an old photo of the President's girlfriend. You scream about patriotism and you tell them she's to blame for their lot in life, you go on television and you call her a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you, Bob. She has done nothing but put herself through law school, prosecute criminals for five years, represent the interests of public school teachers for two years, and lobby for the safety of our natural resources.
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: You want a character debate? Fine, but you better stick with me, 'cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league. I've loved two women in my life. I lost one to cancer, and I lost the other 'cause I was so busy keeping my job I forgot to do my job. Well that ends right now.
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: Tomorrow morning the White House is sending a bill to Congress for its consideration. It's White House Resolution 455, an energy bill requiring a 20 percent reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years. It is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming. The other piece of legislation is the crime bill. As of today it no longer exists. I'm throwing it out. I'm throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense. You cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns. I consider them a threat to national security, and I will go door to door if I have to, but I'm gonna convince Americans that I'm right, and I'm gonna get the guns. We've got serous problems, and we need serious men, and if you want to talk about character, Bob, you'd better come at me with more than a burning flag and a membership card. If you want to talk about character and American values, fine. Just tell me where and when, and I'll show up. This is a time for serious men, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up. My name's Andrew Shepherd, and I am the President.

N: SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his wake. The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.
C: ROBIN

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY
N: A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President.

C: LEWIS
D: He's got the whole White House Press Corps asking each other how to spell "erudite."
C: A.J.
D: Lewis, call the printer.
C: LEWIS
D: I know. Gotta rewrite the State of the Union.
C: A.J.

E: continuing
C: A.J.
D: Where are you going?
C: SHEPHERD

C: A.J.
D: How're you gonna do that?
C: SHEPHERD
D: I haven't worked that out yet. But I'm sure groveling will be involved.
C: A.J.
D: You're just gonna drive over?
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful army in the world. You don't think I can drive ten blocks?
C: SYDNEY
D: Just stay away from DuPont Circle. I hear it's murder this time of day.
N: SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing in the doorway, but of course he does anyway.
C: SYDNEY
D: Hi, A.J.
C: A.J.
D: It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If anybody needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.
N: A.J. exits.
C: SYDNEY
D: I heard your speech. I was in my car, and it just kind of steered its way over here.
C: SHEPHERD
D: I'm glad.

S: EXT. THE CAPITOL - NIGHT
N: It's lit up and glowing on this cold, clear night.
C: ANCHOR

E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. A VIP ROOM - NIGHT
N: It's off the main corridor, and it's being used as a green room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JANIE, and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around in a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff links.

C: SHEPHERD
D: Don't stop what you're doing.
C: LEWIS
D: That's kind of you, sir, but I realize I've been a little insensitive about some personal...
C: SHEPHERD
D: No, you were right. Two hundred and sixty-four million people don't give a damn about my life.
C: LEWIS
D: Just so you know I've never been one of them, Mr. President.
C: ROBIN
D: This way, people. Let's go.
C: SHEPHERD
D: See you after.
E: to LEWIS
N: The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit, ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as she herds people out the door. LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered textbook and has it opened to a specific page...
C: SHEPHERD
D: Whatcha got there, Luce?

C: LUCY

C: A.J.
D: Sounds right up your alley.
N: SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then pulls him into a strong embrace. A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--
C: A.J.
D: Give 'em hell, Andy.
E: continuing

C: A.J.
D: You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.
E: continuing
C: SHEPHERD
D: Thank you. I'll see you afterward. I want a critique.
E: to LUCY
N: The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.
C: SHEPHERD
D: There's been something I've been trying to give you since our first date. I tried a bunch of times, but somehow I've always managed to trip over my job. Anyay...
E: continuing beat

C: JANIE

C: SHEPHERD
D: No, walk with me.
N: They exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS, SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and, most prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK. SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double doors to the House Chamber--

C: SHEPHERD
D: Do what?
E: raising his voice above the cheering
C: SYDNEY
D: Manage to give a woman flowers and be President at the same time.

N: SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as-- --the doors to the Chamber fly open--
C: DOORKEEPER
D: Mr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!!!
N: The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation, shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery... At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both hands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking hands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and we
T: FADE OUT.
