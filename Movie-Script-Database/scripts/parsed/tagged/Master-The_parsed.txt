N: FREDDIE
C: DOCTOR
D: Why don't you turn honest? You seem like an intelligent fellow. 'Quick on your feet - you like to drink?
C: FREDDIE
D: It's a weakness. But I like it.

C: FREDDIE
D: Alright. I intend to do that. You saying you have a job for me? What? As an orderly?
C: DOCTOR
D: You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have to learn. But maybe you could run an elevator, something of that sort.

D: I want to get out of here, but I also like it here. You think I was gonna die?
C: DOCTOR

D: Everything's there isn't it? On the tape? Sure is, we just need to get it working with all the other pieces in synch-ro- nization. No good if it's not plugged into the wall. Can't hear it. But the sounds are still there. No good if those speakers aren't there. Can't hear it.
E: CONT'D
N: (MORE)
C: MASTER
D: But that doesn't mean it's not there, does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy little piece of tape is just nothin' without all the other equipment lined up properly, isn't it? We CAN access the past, traumas and seeds that abberate us in present time and once we access them - we challenge them and throw them away. Previously, I'd established how to access these aberrations and painful memories to pre-birth/cellular times. But the new studies prove there is a time beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which we are now working. At last count, perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our studies show... Besides the everyday struggles of how we become better, more able, more productive homo sapiens, the uses for this new science is the location and removal of certain leukemias, apathies, manics. Depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas. This is the province and science of Cause. If you'll forgive me, I must sit down. Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg injury and limp damndest thing. You see it happens every time I come to Manhattan Island, its a wound I've never conquered and I'll tell you how I found out about, because I never knew what in the H was happening... Well I did some processing to find out. Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me back...we processed over three hours! And something came up. It was this: I lived a life before and suffered a great injury. Knee injury... It was just around 1888. A great number and year. Significant as the creation . year of the new york city sewer system if I'm not wrong... I was a thief and criminal, working late into the night robbing a bank in the western side of the island.
E: CONT'D
N: (MORE)
C: MASTER
D: The crime was committed with a revolver in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I made it clear across town when we were ambushed by the local authorities. -- but I made a slip away. A digression into the under constructed sewer system. It was here that I could no be found - or so my thinking went. All my confidence and all my arrogance was brought upon me. Full in the face. For I was nose to nose with a twenty-five foot alligator in the New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a scare I was in for. Now if you've veer seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR - you'll remember the fear. You see, this being an island, and in those days more inhabited by creature than man, why wouldn't I meet such a beast? In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented drain hole just around 125th Street... present day Harlem County I believe today. Yes. Yes. I stuffed it and made a getaway from both man and beast âshattered my knee in five different places-turned into a piece of glass..woke up early in the morning somewhere near the present day Times Square-which was nothing more than a farm..quite a farm..but that's another story. So what does this say? Injuries stay with us don't they??..They sure do. How's it gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna fix this knee. How are any of us going to get better? More able? We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is not enough. We have Lived Many, Many, Many Lives. So anybody tat is not processing the whole of time - is doing a disservice to man and Will Not Get Better. I cannot put it more simply.
E: CONT'D
N: (MORE)
C: MASTER
D: And as for me now: I just need to find the time away from all of my writing to go back down and DO IT so I don't walk around with the darndest limp everytime I come to town! This story is greeted. with equal parts excitement/complete CONFUSION. MRS. PURCELL slightly nervous.

N: STUFF HIS POCKETS. (OC DIAL. PLAYS...)
C: ANGLE, MAIN LIVING ROOM.
D: MASTER has finished his demonstration and is opening it up for questions/discussions. An OLDER MAN stands up to speak:
E: MR. JOHN MORE, 50's, scholarly, wearing a prominent HANDKERCHIEF Throughout this another OLDER WOMAN has a terrible cough from the back of the room.
C: JOHN MORE
D: Some of this seems quite like hypnosis, is it not?
C: MASTER
D: Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ.
C: JOHN MORE
D: What is the difference between this and psychotherapy?
C: MASTER
D: Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees.
E: he, he
C: JOHN MORE
D: But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and modern psychotherapy, does it not?
C: MASTER
D: No it does not. This is an exact science, you see. Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler. It's engineering. Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed. So that's that.
C: JOHN MORE
D: And how long does this take?
C: MASTER
D: That depends. But it can be quite fast. Quite fast. Or it can take some time. Sometimes less than 36 hours.
C: JOHN MORE
D: 36 hours? And you're saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what you've just said?
C: MASTER
D: Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested. 22 cases cured. Those are the results.
C: JOHN MORE
D: You can understand scepticism, can you not?
C: MASTER
D: Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it.
C: JOHN MORE
D: Are you a religious people?
C: MASTER
D: We are not incorporated as a religion, no. But remember this: that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy. Philosophy is senior to religion. You could call us a religion of religions.
C: JOHN MORE
D: Are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook?
C: MASTER
D: No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see. And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to
N: MANKIND -
C: JOHN MORE
D: Do you think it can?
C: MASTER
D: I not only think it can, I know it does.
C: JOHN MORE
D: You mentioned 'good science' and what it does.. .but doesn't that, by definition, allow for more than one opinion?
C: MASTER
D: Indeed, indeed. Which is why our gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -
C: JOHN MORE
D: Otherwise you merely have the will of one man - which is the basis of cult, is it not?
C: MASTER
D: T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are, all of us, working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it's original state of perfect - whilst righting civilization.
C: JOHN MORE
D: I must say that I find it quite --
N: MASTER AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE WHAT ELSE YOU HAVE TO SAY YOU SLIMY LITTLE PIECE OF CUM FUCK. YOU ARE NOTHING. AND WORTHLESS AT THAT. YOU PUNY LITTLE NOTHING OF NOTHING. IT WORKS IF YOU USE IT. WHO IS THIS MAN?

C: JOHN MORE
D: I'm sorry if you're unwilling to defend your beliefs in any kind of rational
N: WAY -- MASTER I HAVE TAKEN MY FUCKING TIME WITH YOU AND YOU ARE OVER NOW. YOU SLIMY PIG SHIT. The WOMAN that's been coughing cannot stop: MASTER (CONT'D) STOP COUGHING. STOP COUGHING YOU HORRIBLE OLD WOMAN. YOU DON'T GET IT. YOU DON'T

D: I'm from there. Master and headquarters there for a year.
C: FREDDIE
D: .how'd you see them?
C: CLARK
D: I read the first book. I worked at Boeing for three years. When I read the book, I didn't want to waste my time there anymore. I came to help the Cause.
C: FREDDIE
D: What did it say?
C: CLARK
D: I'm skeptical of everything. Always have been. All I know is I used to not be able to sleep. Now I sleep through the night. I spent 18 months at the Presidio with every Army head-shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as Book One did. That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met Elizabeth, so...
C: FREDDIE
D: That's good.
C: CLARK
D: He changes things. And the research is hard to keep up with. None of this is done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy to get lost.
C: FREDDIE
D: He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I don't understand myself but - more time with it and I might - I feel better - I feel like I've more to do with my life since I met him... and I JUST met him. So - that can't be a bad thing, right?

N: (MORE)
C: CLARK
D: Master walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript... . threw It on the table. . .and flung himself out of the skyscraper window... Master took the book and hid it where no one could get to it...it's inside this book: all the history. All the facts. All too dangerous. He re-wrote it, using what he could as the basis for what we are able to accept and learn today.. .that's Book One that we all study and know. . .but the real stuff.

N: AMA...
C: FREDDIE
D: Stop talking...
C: MASTER
D: You're fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago. An Invader Force played games with your spirit as it.moved from one body to the next - free for a moment - it was free and the invader force captured it - spun you around in a device not unlike a grinder and hit you with waves of high wattage electrical impulses - quaver bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped in scalding hot water, then freezing cold - a control mechanism - any legal action, a summons to court, the sight of a police officer, exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order,
N: TRIGGERED - the mere threat of arrest will make a psychotic breakdown. This happened to you and you are free to stop it. Their game and implants are no match for you. Laugh in their face. Laugh at it. These triggers are useless now. You created THEM so YOU can DESTROY THEM. MASTER pulls away ... FREDDIE looks at him. HOLD.
