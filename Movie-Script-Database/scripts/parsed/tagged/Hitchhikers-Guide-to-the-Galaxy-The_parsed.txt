C: GUIDE. GUIDE VOICE
D: It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.
N: A small square image appears on screen. Home video. The dolphin stadium at Sea World.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact, entirely accurate.
E: CONT'D
N: The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth. They had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means.
E: CONT'D
N: They leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher...
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double- backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but in fact the message was this... "So long and thanks for all the fish."
E: CONT'D
N: TITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES) Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles. Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the dolphins have vanished. END TITLES As night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then...
C: VOICE ON RADIO
D: ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San Diego reporting their dolphins have mysteriously disappeared overnight.

S: INT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
N: CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates. A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room. IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror. He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA KETTLE WHISTLES O.S.
S: INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS. He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia) at a costume party. He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he sees the bulldozers. The tea cup shatters on the floor.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his house. He yells into his mobile phone.
C: ARTHUR
D: What do you mean he's gone out to lunch? You just said he was still at breakfast!
E: into phone
N: MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him.
C: PROSSER
D: Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever.
C: ARTHUR
D: I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.
C: PROSSER
D: This bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. You should have made your protest months ago.
C: ARTHUR
D: The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me right away of course. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he told me.
N: 5 4. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 CONTINUED: 5 The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase.
C: PROSSER
D: Look. These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year.
C: ARTHUR
D: On display? I had to go down to a cellar!
C: PROSSER
D: That's the display department.
C: ARTHUR
D: I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'.
C: PROSSER
D: Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?
C: ARTHUR
D: How much?
C: PROSSER
D: None at all.
C: FORD
D: Arthur!
E: O.S. American accent
N: Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill, pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and bags of peanuts. This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense. As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket. He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.
C: ARTHUR
D: Ford?
N: He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.
C: FORD
D: Arthur! There you are. Here drink and eat with me. We need to talk.
C: ARTHUR
D: Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford They're going to demolish my home,
C: FORD
D: Whoa. You already know? How?
N: Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer. 5 5. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 CONTINUED: (2) 5
C: FORD
D: Oh. When you say "they" you mean they. Got it. Listen, I gotta tell you something important, and I gotta tell you now.
E: CONT'D
C: ARTHUR
D: But what about my house?
N: Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the bulldozer driver. He pushes the cart over to him. ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die. The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer and eating the peanuts. Ford returns to Arthur.
C: FORD
D: C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers.
C: ARTHUR
D: Can we trust him?
C: FORD
D: I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.
C: ARTHUR
D: And how far's that?
C: FORD
D: About twelve minutes away.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. VILLAGE PUB - MIDDAY
N: Ford and Arthur enter the half-full pub. Ford hurries to the bar. Arthur follows, cell phone to his ear.
C: FORD
D: Six pints of bitter. And quickly. The world's about to end.
C: BARMAN
D: Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.
N: He starts to pull pints. Ford shoves bar peanuts into his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone...
C: ARTHUR
D: Well, when does he get back from lunch? Or is he going straight out for tea?!
N: He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.
C: ARTHUR
D: This is shaping up to be a crap day.
E: CONT'D
N: 6 6. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 CONTINUED: 6
C: FORD
D: It's about to get a lot crappier.
C: BARMAN
D: There you are, six pints.
N: Ford slaps down a Â£50 note. The barman's impressed.
C: FORD
D: Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to spend it.
N: Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur.
C: ARTHUR
D: Three? At lunchtime?
C: FORD
D: Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
C: ARTHUR
D: Very deep. You should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you.
C: FORD
D: Drink up.
C: ARTHUR
D: Why three pints?
C: FORD
D: Muscle relaxant. And eat these. You'll need the salt.
E: grabbing more peanuts
C: ARTHUR
D: What's going on. Ford?
C: FORD
D: What would you say if I told you I wasn't really from Guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Eetelgeuse?
C: ARTHUR
D: Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely to say?
C: FORD
D: Remember when we met? That car was racing toward me, I was trying to greet it, you pushed me out of the way?
N: 7 7. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 QUICK CUT TO A STREET - MID-DAY 7 Ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand to a fast approaching car. Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him out of the way as the car zooms past. (6 cont) BACK TO FORD IN THE PUB: (6 cont)
C: FORD
D: Didn't you find it a little strange that I was trying to shake hands with a car?
C: ARTHUR
D: I assumed you were drunk.
C: FORD
D: I thought cars were the dominant life form. I was trying to introduce myself.
E: shaking his head
C: ARTHUR
D: And that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies?
C: FORD
D: You saved my life that day. Now I'm saving yours.
E: nodding
N: Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.
C: ARTHUR
D: This must be Thursday. I never could get the hang of Thursdays.
C: FORD
D: Look, if it's about your house...
C: ARTHUR
D: No, it's not that. It's....
N: He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone.
C: ARTHUR
D: I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I found her, and then I let her get away. You remember that fancy dress party I told you about?
E: CONT'D
C: FORD
D: This isn't a long story, is it? We've only got six minutes.
N: Arthur shakes his head. Ford checks his watch. 6 8. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 CONTINUED: (2) 6
C: FORD
D: Okay. Talk and drink. Fancy dress party.
E: CONT'D
C: ARTHUR
D: At that flat in Islington. I told you about it. Last week, remember?
N: FLASHBACK TO:
S: INT. ISLINGTON FLAT - NIGHT
N: Crowded flat. Everyone is in costume. Loud music BLARES.
C: ARTHUR
D: I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't want to go, would have much rather stayed home and, I don't know, brush the dog. Anything. But there I was -- and then, there she was...
E: V.O.
N: Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet, sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.
C: TRICIA
D: Who are you?
E: O.S.
N: Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid 19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks beautiful. Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.
C: ARTHUR
D: I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.
C: TRICIA
D: No, I mean who are you?
C: ARTHUR
D: Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um... Livingston, I presume. Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on short notice.
E: sheepishly tipping his hat pointing to her attire
C: TRICIA
D: You're the first person who's got it right. Everyone keeps calling me Sherlock.
C: ARTHUR
D: Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.
N: 8 9. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 CONTINUED: 8
C: ARTHUR
D: Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.
N: He pets the dog. She smiles. He smiles back. A CAMERA FLASH FLASHES. JUMP CUT to... THE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of he and Tricia on his cell phone. They look at the screen image and laugh.
C: ARTHUR
D: She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics, another in biology...
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: TRICIA
D: I've got so many degrees I am officially unemployable. Let's drink to that!
N: They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.
C: ARTHUR
D: And just as I was asking myself, "Why is this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day, out of nowhere she says...
E: V.O.
C: TRICIA
D: Let's go somewhere.
C: ARTHUR
D: Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a lovely little cafe around the corner...
C: TRICIA
D: I was thinking Madagascar.
C: ARTHUR
D: Is that a new club on Dean Street?
C: TRICIA
D: No. It's a country. Off the coast of Africa.
C: ARTHUR
D: Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go then. Good God, you're serious.
E: then realizing...
N: 9 10. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 CONTINUED: 9 She nods. Arthur isn't sure how to react.
C: ARTHUR
D: Well...that's...an extraordinary proposition. But...I can't just up and go. What about my job?
E: CONT'D
C: TRICIA
D: Quit. Get a new one when we return.
C: ARTHUR
D: I can't just...what about my house? Who would feed my dog?
C: TRICIA
D: Bring him with.
C: ARTHUR
D: He's a Welsh Collie. He'd feel all out of place in Madagascar.
N: Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.
C: ZAPHOD
D: You don't want to go to Madagascar.
E: O.S.
N: They both turn to face ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX - very charming, extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other worldly." Knee high boots, a yellow sash...
C: ZAPHOD
D: Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy -- of course, you probably already know that. I'm headed for a lost and distant planet. Would you like to see my spaceship?
E: CONT'D
C: ARTHUR
D: I went to refresh our drinks. When I came back, she was gone.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BACK IK THE PUB - CONTINUOUS
N: Arthur stares into his beer, plagued by this loss.
C: ARTHUR
D: "Would you like to see my spaceship?" Really, what sort of chat up line is that?
C: FORD
D: More popular than you'd think.
C: ARTHUR
D: I've left messages, sent letters... It's like she's vanished off the face of the earth.
N: HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
C: FORD
D: Hey, it happens. Speaking of... We've got two minutes. So drink up.
E: pulling a blinking electronic device from his satchel
N: There's a ROAR OF ENGINES and a LOUD CRASH outside. Arthur and everyone else in the pub look up.
C: ARTHUR
D: My house!
N: He runs out. Ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket.
C: FORD
D: A round for everyone, on me.
C: BARMAN
D: You really think the world's going to end? Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over our heads or something?
E: Ford nods
C: FORD
D: If you want.
C: BARMAN
D: Will it help?
C: FORD
D: Not really.
N: He gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute, exits.
C: BARMAN
D: Last orders, then?
S: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE PUB - MID-DAY
N: Arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being bulldozed. Ford strides casually behind in the distance.
C: ARTHUR
D: STOP! STOP, YOU BASTARDS!!
N: Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY. 11a A GIGANTIC YELLOW SPACESHIP (picture a concrete tower 11a block)) sweeps overhead. Ford hits the deck. Arthur is blown sideways. Trees are uprooted. Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthur's house. He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes up with -- A TOWEL. He hurries to Arthur's side. 1 12. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 1a CONTINUED: 11a Another ship screams over, blowing them down again. Rain is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big THWUMP! Everywhere is soaked.
C: ARTHUR (CONT'D}
D: WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE THINGS?!
C: FORD
D: Ships from a Vogon Constructor Fleet. I picked up their signal this morning.
N: He shows Arthur his blinking Sens-0-Matic device.
C: FORD {CONT'D}
D: Here. You'll need this.
N: He tosses Arthur the towel. Then, he removes a short black rod, his ELECTRONIC THUMB. He sticks it out.
S: INT. SATELLITE TRACKING STATION
N: Picture mission control in Houston. WORKERS scramble. Monitors line the wall showing hundreds of news reports from around the globe; panic, chaos and pandemonium. Suddenly, there's a loud HUM through the speakers, followed by loud GARGLES and SCREECHING. Then...
C: JELTZ {THROUGH SPEAKERS)
D: People of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace planning council.
S: INT. A SUBURBAN BREAKFAST ROOM. CONTINUOUS
N: A FAMILY at breakfast, baffled that their cutlery, bowls and glasses resonate with the sound of Jeltz's voice.
C: JELTZ
D: As you are probably aware, plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system...
E: VOICE ONLY
S: EXT. OXFORD STREET ELECTRONICS STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: Several PATRONS watch the wall of TV's, all projecting a snowy, distorted image. Jeltz's voice blares through the speakers.
C: JELTZ
D: ...and, unfortunately, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you.
N: Through the window behind them, throngs of people stampede down Oxford Street, screaming. 1 13. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
S: 5 EXT. SATELLITE TRACKING STATION 15
N: A TECHNICIAN speaks urgently into a microphone while his co-workers watch the chaos on the monitors behind.
C: TECHNICIAN
D: Hello! Can you hear us? Please respond!
S: INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: The VOGON BRIDGE is like a waterlogged old Skoda.
C: JELTZ
D: There's no point in acting all surprised about it. The plans and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge formal complaints.
E: INTO THE P.A.
S: EXT. FIELD BY ARTHUR'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS
N: Ford grabs hold of Arthur's shirt, extends the Thumb.
S: INT. THE PUB. CONTINUOUS
N: PULL BACK FROM JUKE BOX. The pub seems deserted.
C: VOGON CAPTAIN
D: What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.
E: through juke box
N: PULL BACK FARTHER - people lay on the ground with PAPER BAGS on their heads.
S: INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP BRIDGE. -- CONTINUOUS
N: Jeltz turns. He's large, green and walrusy.
C: JELTZ
D: Apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all. Energize the demolition beams.
N: One of his walrusy FIRST OFFICERS pushes a yellow button. BIG SHOT. FROM SPACE. LOOKING DOWN ON EARTH As all the Vogon ships simultaneously send down a beam of yellow light. Glowing fireballs travel down the beams toward Earth. On impact, they bore into the surface.
C: JELTZ
D: Detonate.
E: O.S.
N: 2 14. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 0 CONTINUED: 20 Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES. Just collapses in on itself. Gone. The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS. Then a distant RED GLOW appears. As it gets nearer we see that it says..."THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY."
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book...
N: The title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an electronic book with lots of buttons.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: ...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor.
E: CONT'D
N: The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations...
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD PERSON, ANYWAY?
E: CONT'D
N: Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in large friendly letters on its cover.
E: CONT'D
N: The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee. PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face. 2 15. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
S: 2 INT. HOLD OF VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP - NIGHT 22
N: Arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide.
C: ARTHUR
D: So you're not from Guilford, which would explain the accent -- which I've always wondered about...and you're not an out of work actor -- but rather a writer for this...this...book thing.
N: Ford nods. Arthur rubs his weary brow.
C: ARTHUR
D: I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.
E: CONT'D
N: Ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.
C: FORD
D: Here. Eat these. If you've never been through a transmat beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein.
N: Arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. Ford feels his way around the room, looking for something.
C: ARTHUR
D: If I asked where we were would I regret
C: FORD
D: We're safe. For now.
C: ARTHUR
D: Good.
C: FORD
D: We're in a storage hold in one of the ships of the Vogon constructor fleet ...
C: ARTHUR
D: Obviously some strange usage of the word safe I wasn't previously aware of.
C: FORD
D: Is it?
E: not getting the sarcasm
C: ARTHUR
D: Tell me you're joking.
C: FORD
D: Okay. I'm joking.
C: ARTHUR
D: And do a reassuring little laugh.
N: Ford does a reassuring little laugh.
C: ARTHUR
D: Now tell me where we really are.
E: CONT'D
N: 2 16. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 2 CONTINUED: (2) 22
C: FORD
D: In the storage hold of a Vogon constructor ship.
N: Ford continues his search. Arthur's breathing quickens.
C: ARTHUR
D: Get me home. Ford.
C: FORD
D: Home? Arthur...your home... is...
C: ARTHUR
D: Oh God - it was demolished! I've got to reach my lawyer! He must be back from lunch by now...
N: He pulls out his cell phone. Desperately punches numbers. Ford flips on a light switch, revealing a messy chamber full of alien junk and old mattresses.
C: FORD
D: You don't remember, do you? Okay. I've got something to tell you. It ain't gonna be easy, but you're gonna have to just deal, okay?
E: taking his cell phone
C: ARTHUR
D: Good god. Is this really the interior of a flying saucer?
C: FORD
D: Yeah. Why?
N: SHOT: DEEP SPACE. THE VOGON FLEET IN FLIGHT
C: ARTHUR
D: Well, it's a bit squalid isn't it?
E: V.O.
C: FORD
D: Hey man, you're in denial.
E: V.O.
S: INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP BRIDGE
N: Jeltz consults one screen after another. At last he sees Ford and Arthur. His walrusy eyes narrow. BACK IN THE SLEEPING QUARTERS - MINUTES LATER
C: ARTHUR
D: Blown up? BLOWN UP?! Couldn't you have done something?!!
C: FORD
D: I did. I saved you.
N: 2 17. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 5 CONTINUED: 25
C: ARTHUR
D: But there's six billion other people.
C: FORD
D: And all those ants.
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes, but ants aren't exactly people!
C: FORD
D: And now you're thinking like a Vogon. I saved your life, okay? Which makes us even. Next thing.
E: before Arthur can respond
N: Ford throws Arthur a towel. Arthur looks confused.
C: FORD
D: It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive out here, you really gotta know where your towel is. Now gimme a hand over here.
E: CONT'D
N: Arthur joins Ford near a rusty ventilation pipe.
C: FORD
D: Careful, it's hot.
E: CONT'D
N: He slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of it, Arthur does the same.
C: FORD
D: We've got to get off this ship before the Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers. Which is why they make ships with walls that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to pass through. So we've got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride. Pull.
E: CONT'D
N: They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe.
C: ARTHUR
D: What's a Vogon?
C: FORD
D: Ask the guide. Say "Vogons."
N: Ford continues turning dials. Arthur lifts the Guide.
C: ARTHUR
D: "Vogons."
N: The word "VOGONS" floats up into his field of vision.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Vogons.
N: 2 18. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 5 CONTINUED: (2) 25 CHARACTER, HISTORY, HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH, HOW TO ANNOY, WHAT TO AVOID. Arthur touches CHARACTER.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire-lighters.
E: CONT'D
N: Arthur touches 'HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH.'
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat.
E: CONT'D
N: Arthur touches 'WHAT TO AVOID'.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you.
E: CONT'D
C: FORD
D: They can't think, they can't imagine, most of them can't even spell. They just run things. And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be. They've destroyed a planet today, that always makes them a little feisty.
E: turns dial opposite direction
C: ARTHUR
D: It can't be gone. It can't be! (grabbing the Guide, shouting} Earth!
C: FORD
D: Shhh!
C: ARTHUR
D: EARTH!!
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Earth.
N: An image of the Earth appears on the Guide's screen.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Harmless.
E: CONT'D
N: Arthur waits...and waits. The Earth image fades away. 2 19. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 5 CONTINUED: (3) 25
C: ARTHUR
D: That's it? That's all this idiotic book has to say about my home? "Harmless?"
C: FORD
D: Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors. No one knew much about Earth. That's why I was there. To expand the entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded.
C: ARTHUR
D: What does it say now?
C: FORD
D: Mostly harmless.
N: Before Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears.
C: ARTHUR
D: Ahhh, what the hell is that?!
C: FORD
D: Here. Put this in your ear.
N: Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles.
C: ARTHUR
D: WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH...
N: The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to get the fish in Arthur's ear. JELTZ (ON SPEAKER)
C: ARTHUR
D: Argh! What's happening...?
N: As he succeeds, the noise mutates to the Vogon Captain's voice. Arthur looks incredulous.
C: JELTZ
D: This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention!
E: ON SPEAKER
C: FORD
D: The fish. It's translating for you.
C: JELTZ
D: According to our instruments we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended and...
E: ON SPEAKER
N: 2 20. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 5 CONTINUED: (4) 25 Arthur doesn't want to hear any of this...pulls the fish back out of his ear. JELTZ {ON SPEAKER) (CONT'D) Ford struggles, shoves it back in Arthur's ear again.
C: JELTZ
D: ...and this is not a taxi service for degenerate freeloaders.
E: CONT'D
N: The door BURSTS open. A VOGON GUARD enters. Grabs Ford and Arthur. They struggle.
C: VOGON GUARD
D: Resistance is useless!
N: The struggle continues. As they're dragged out the door, Arthur continues to try to yank the fish out of his ear. Ford wrestles with him, trying to keep it in.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The Babelfish is small, yellow, leechlike, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe.
S: INT. VOGON SHIP CORRIDOR.
N: A bleak corridor. The Vogon guard pushes a still struggling Arthur and Ford down it.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language.
N: Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal window. He backs up to look out.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable thing that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved in the Universe purely by chance that many thinkers have chosen to see this as a final clinching proof of the NON-existence of God.
E: CONT'D
N: 26a ARTHUR'S POV -- of space through the window, beautiful 26a purple-orange clouds of swirling stars and gasses.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The argument goes something like this... "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."
E: CONT'D
N: 2 21. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 6a CONTINUED: 26a It's finally sinking in -- he's in deep space.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: "But," says Man, "the Babelfish is a dead give-away. It proves you exist, and so therefore you don't. QED." "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
E: CONT'D
N: The guard yanks Arthur away, pushes him forward with Ford.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid from making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book, 'WELL THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP FOR GOD.'
E: CONT'D
N: Arthur looks lost and confused. They approach a set of double doors. He stops. The Guard shoves him forward.
C: VOGON GUARD
D: Resistance is useless!
C: ARTHUR
D: Ford...
C: FORD
D: Don't panic. If we're lucky, they'll throw us out into space.
C: ARTHUR
D: And if we're unlucky?
N: Off Ford's apprehensive look we CUT TO...
S: INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Arthur and Ford are strapped against two concrete pillars with hundreds of elastic bands. A STRANGE AND LETHAL LOOKING DEVICE DESCENDS FROM THE CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- BLAM! Jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it. We hear FEEDBACK. It's a microphone (like ones used to introduce boxers). He taps it. This thing on? It is. He faces them, holds up a book entitled... " " -- smirks, then begins to read Vogon poetry.
C: JELTZ
D: Oh freddled gruntbuggly! Thy suppurations are to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.
N: Ford WRITHES in pain, as does Arthur but less so. 2 22. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 7 CONTINUED: 27
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe.
N: Ford VIBRATES like he's having an epileptic seizure. Arthur just looks like he has a migraine.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid- Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off.
E: CONT'D
N: Spasms wrack Ford's body. He SCREAMS. Arthur squints.
C: JELTZ
D: Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheaon, see if I don't!
N: Ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp. Arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The absolute worst poetry was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix. It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was.
C: JELTZ
D: So, Earthlings, I present you with a simple choice. Either die in the vacuum of space, or -- tell what you thought of my poem.
N: Ford is spent, can't say a word. Arthur looks up.
C: ARTHUR
D: Actually...I rather liked it.
N: Jeltz looks surprised. Ford notices, whispers to Arthur.
C: FORD
D: Good tact. Run with it.
C: ARTHUR
D: Um...some of the words I didn't understand, but I found the imagery quite effective.

D: And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity...
C: FORD
D: Vogonity!
C: ARTHUR
D: ... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate, er...
C: FORD
D: ... whatever it was ...
C: ARTHUR
D: ... the poem was about.
N: Jeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly.
C: FORD
D: Damn.
C: ARTHUR
D: What?
C: FORD
D: I think you just saved my life again.
C: JELTZ
D: An astute analysis. Very impressive. Throw them off the ship.
E: turning to the Guard
N: The guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge.
C: VOGON GUARD
D: Resistance is useless!
C: JELTZ
D: Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor..." Death's too good for them.
N: Jeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab.
S: INT. VOGON SHIP CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER
N: The Guard shoves them into the airlock.
S: INT. AIRLOCK -- CONTINUING
N: They sit, panting. Arthur stares forward.

D: So this is it? We're going to die?
N: 2 24. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 9 CONTINUED: 29
C: FORD
D: Yes. No, wait! What's this switch? No, it's nothing. We are going to die.
E: reaching for it
N: Arthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself.
C: ARTHUR
D: You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.
C: FORD
D: Why? What did you she tell you?
C: ARTHUR
D: I don't know. I didn't listen.
N: Ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up toward Arthur. He raises an eyebrow. Will this help?
C: FORD
D: You're sweating.
N: Ford dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then -- PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out.
S: EXT. DEEP SPACE -- CONTINUOUS
N: Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: "Space..." says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the market, but that's just peanuts compared to space..." and so on.
N: The weightless guide twirls away. Arthur reaches for it. The words "DON'T PANIC" alight.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: It also says that if you hold a lung full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds -- but with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1 against...

D: ...which, by a staggering coincidence, is also the telephone number of the Islington flat where Arthur once went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to connect with.
E: CONT'D
N: He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips. His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away. 30a Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny 30a hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside out. Arthur and Ford are enveloped, then replaced by a stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD.

E: ON TV
N: PULL BACK to reveal ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX, leaning toward the TV, watching with a very satisfied grin...
C: FEMALE VOICE
D: Three to one...two to one...
E: O.S.
N: Annoyed, he turns. There's a woman with red hair (TRILLIAN), her back to him, reading numbers off a console display and speaking into a microphone.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Probability factor of one to one...we have normality, I repeat we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon.
E: into microphone
C: ZAPHOD
D: Hey. Do you mind? I can't hear.
N: TRILLIAN turns -- and we now recognize her as Tricia from the fancy dress party. Her hair is shorter and bright red. She looks amazing.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Can we put your ego aside for one moment? Something important has happened.
C: ZAPHOD
D: If there's anything more important than my ego on this ship, I want it caught and shot now.
N: He turns back to the TV and turns it up.

C: TRILLIAN
D: We have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay.
N: His head jerks upwards. He quickly grabs it with his hands and shoves it back down.

C: TRILLIAN
D: When you engaged the Improbability Drive.

C: ZAPHOD
D: That's impossible.
C: TRILLIAN
D: No. Just very, very improbable.
C: ZAPHOD
D: I don't have time for this! We've got the police of half the Galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, eh?
N: He reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall. She stops him.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Don't. I'll send Marvin. Marvin!
E: calling
N: Zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its seat behind them. This is MARVIN. He trudges slump- shouldered toward Zaphod.

D: I won't enjoy it.
C: ZAPHOD
D: She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do it will you?

C: MARVIN
D: I'm not getting you down at all am I?
E: CONT'D
C: TRILLIAN
D: No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just part of life.

S: INT. BRIDGE OF VOGON DESTROYER SHIP - NIGHT
N: A light blinks on a console. A VOGON CAPTAIN turns a dial, listens through his head set. He punches a few buttons. COMMANDER KWALTZ (green and walrusy like Jeltz) appears on the large monitor, sitting in his chair at Command Headquarters.
C: VOGON CAPTAIN

D: We're having a bit of a chat if you don't mind.
N: Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly, Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots all the up way revealing a second head that lives somewhere under his chin. ZAPHOD HEAD 2 You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up or I'll kick you in the gones!
C: FORD
D: There's the Zaphod I remember.
N: Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists. Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur buckles and hits the floor. ZAPHOD HEAD 2 You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford. He's a guest on my ship.

HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 9 CONTINUED: (2) 39 He does this for the other two forms as well. Questular watches dumbfounded as Kwaltz hands the papers back to the messenger who turns and runs off.

N: Zaphod's Head 2 is still up, beaming. ZAPHOD HEAD 2 Damn, I'm good. Hands slam Head 2 down. Zaphod (Head 1) turns to Ford.
C: ZAPHOD
D: So -- you along for the ride or am I dropping you somewhere?
C: FORD
D: Depends. Where you going?
E: still wary of the two heads
C: ZAPHOD
D: Into the pages of history, cousin. And when you see what I'm about to show you, you'll beg me to take you with us.
N: WITH TRILLIAN -- who notices Arthur looking ill.
C: TRILLIAN
D: You okay?
C: ARTHUR
D: Normally I would say "I'll live," but given the circumstances... Is there any tea on this spaceship?
E: wiping his brow
C: TRILLIAN
D: This way.
N: She exits. Arthur follows. Zaphod steps back, blocking his way.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Hey, apeman. Earthman. I'm sorry, what was your name again?
C: ARTHUR
D: Arthur.

C: ZAPHOD
D: Right. No hard feelings, okay? And sorry to hear about your planet, but don't mention it to the girl because if you do I'll...I'll...
N: He smiles broader. Then Head 2 pops up and finishes... ZAPHOD HEAD 2 I'll pull your spleen out through your ass! Zaphod slams Head 2 back into place..then smiles again. Arthur furrows his brow and Zaphod and follows Trillian.
C: FORD
D: Two heads. Interesting choice.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Apparently you can't be President with a whole brain.
C: FORD
D: So you carved it up?
C: ZAPHOD
D: Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests -- or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is-- --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and that's when I realized I had this.
E: thinking

N: CLOSE ON - the NUTRI-MATIC MACHINE. Brownish liquid flows into it a Martini glass, topped with dry-ice fog. Arthur removes the glass. Sips. Grimaces
C: TRILLIAN
D: I suppose I should have said it resembles tea.
C: ARTHUR
D: So two heads is what does it for a girl, then? I mean, if I'd had two heads. Or three?

D: Well, what am I supposed to be like? Green? Bleeping? What?
C: TRILLIAN
D: Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it hurt?
C: ARTHUR
D: No, I suppose it wouldn't..
C: TRILLIAN
D: I mean...
N: She points to his jaw, he nods, she picks up her BACKPACK.
C: TRILLIAN
D: I might have an aspirin.
E: CONT'D
N: She unzips it. TWO MICE scurry out and scamper off, a hair-clip is clipped to one of the mice's tail.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Hey. What are they doing in there?
E: CONT'D
N: Before she can catch them, they scurry under the door.
C: TRILLIAN {CONT'D)
D: They were from my lab at university. Odd...
C: ARTHUR
D: So all that's left is me and you, "mostly harmless," and two lab rats.
N: She furrows her brow. What does he mean?
C: ARTHUR
D: Look, there's something I should tell you...
E: CONT'D
C: ZAPHOD
D: Showtime, Trill!
E: O.S.

C: ZAPHOD
D: --and when I saw what I'm about to show you, that's when I realized why I did what I did to my brain -- or it least, I think that's why.
N: ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN -- The screen brightens. A BRAND LOGO appears (a circle made of a dotted line with an "M" in the middle) then a sub- title: MAGRATHEAN PUBLIC ARCHIVE. Zaphod fast forwards until a noisy picture DISSOLVES TO...
S: EXT. OUTSIDE TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT -- DAY
N: A procession surrounds a CHARIOT. Two young philosophers, LUNKWILL and FOOK (20'S) ride it into a grand TEMPLE.
S: INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT.
N: The aisles are lined with Priest-Technicians. Ahead is DEEP THOUGHT - a huge Buddha-esque computer. The procession peels away to both sides. Lunkwill and Fook dismount and approach.
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence?
E: deep and sonorous
C: LUNKWILL
D: Your task, O computer...
C: FOOK
D: Hang on. Did you say second greatest?
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: Second greatest. Yes.
C: FOOK
D: But we designed you to be the greatest computer so you could...
C: LUNKWILL
D: You're not talking about the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?

C: FOOK
D: Then what's the problem?
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: I am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help. Which, one day, you are going to need.
C: LUNKWILL
D: Let's just ask the question.
E: to Fook
C: FOOK
D: Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We want you to tell us -- the Answer.
N: Long pause. Deep Thought bleeps and bloops.
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: The Answer...to what?
C: LUNKWILL
D: You know. The answer. To Life...the Universe...Everything.
C: FOOK
D: We'd really like an answer. Something simple. Can you do it?
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an answer. But I'll have to think about it.

S: INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT --
N: Lunkwill and Fook enter the now modern temple, flanked by a crowd. They have beards and look like they're in their 40's. Deep Thought rises, looks lifeless. WORRIED MUTTERS FROM THE CROWD. Slowly, Deep Thought groans to life.
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: Can I help you?

D: Deep Thought. Do you have...
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: An answer for you? Yes. I have.

E: O.S.

D: Give us the Ultimate Question then!!
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: I can't. But there is one who can. A computer that is to come after me, one that I will design. A computer to calculate the Ultimate Question, one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program. I shall design this computer for you. And it shall be called...

C: FORD
D: I mean, why do you want to know the Ultimate Question?
C: ZAPHOD
D: Oh. Well -- partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's for the fame and the money.
N: He continues preparing the ship. Trillian consults the huge MANUAL, turning dials, flipping switches...
C: ARTHUR
D: But -- you're President of the Galaxy, aren't you?
C: ZAPHOD
D: Yes, Arman.

D: There. To find Deep Thought. On Magrathea.
C: FORD
D: Magrathea!? Magrathea is a myth, a legend...
C: ZAPHOD
D: No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.
C: FORD
D: You mean to tell me you carved up your brain so you could become President so you would get invited to the launching ceremony of this ship...so you could steal it... so you could go to Magrathea -- which, according to most sane people, doesn't even exist?

C: ARTHUR
D: You're guessing?
C: ZAPHOD
D: Hey, anyone who's not up for that, there's the door. Now who's in?
C: FORD
D: For a trip to a place that doesn't exist? I'm in. My editor will think I'm crazy, but what the hell -- he already thinks I'm dead.
N: He takes out the Guide. Zaphod looks to Trillian.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Definitely. I'm in.
N: They're all standing together. They turn to Arthur. Arthur looks to Trillian. She stares back -- waiting.

D: Do I even have a choice?
N: Zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery.
C: ZAPHOD
D: No!
N: Arthur looks at the button.

N: Improbability Drive Effect -- as the ship flips across space and disappears, leaving nothing but shimmers. 5 47. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 0 CONTINUED: 50
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the appropriate re-entry point. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well understood.
N: Seconds later, the Vogon Destroyer comes out of hyperspace and slows to cruising speed.
S: INT. VOGON DESTROYER SHIP. BRIDGE - NIGHT
N: Vogon controllers and copilots turn dials and push buttons, scrambling to regain a signal.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy.
N: Kwaltz and Questular appear on the monitor.
C: KWALTZ
D: Well, Captain...?
N: Controllers turn more dials, trying to find the ship.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Many respectable physicists said they weren't going to stand for that sort of thing partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.
C: VOGON CAPTAIN
D: We had them sir. These are the coordinates. But -- they're not here.

D: I can see that. WHERE ARE THEY?
N: The captain shrugs. Kwaltz heaves a walrusy sigh. 5 48. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
S: 2 EXT. DEEP SPACE - NIGHT 52
N: We hover above a greenish/purplish planet. IMPROBABILITY EFFECT - space RIPPLES. Something begins to materialize, something big and gray - tumbling toward us. We now see the big, gray thing is a GIANT RHINOCEROS -- which ripples, flips inside out and becomes the Heart of Gold. 53a INT. HEART OF GOLD.

D: Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should I pursue?
C: KWALTZ

C: QUESTULAR
D: But I'm acting president!

The creature points down the street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen and paper. Zaphod signs an autograph and moves on. The alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under several arms. More mist rises. FOLLOW IT UP revealing: A LARGE BUILDING -- a temple with two giant arches. The others follow. CAMERA TILTS UP and we see this building looks like a nose lying horizontally, the "giant arches" are the nostrils.
S: INT. ARKLESEIZURE TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

A congregation of worshipers faces front where HUMMA KAVULA stands behind a podium. He's a humanoid wearing a white robe and night-vision sun glasses.
C: HUMMA KAVULA
D: The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are you ready? Let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us.
N: Instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward. Zaphod marches down the center aisle while Humma prays.

N: ZAPHOD HEAD 2 During the campaign, Humma -- you said I was stupid.
C: HUMMA KAVULA
D: This Humma you speak of no longer exists. He came here in his consolation position as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his wicked ways. He now goes by the holy name Tazelo the Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his devoted followers.
N: ZAPHOD HEAD 2 I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!! The 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY GUARDS aim their weapons. One runs up and smacks Zaphod in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Thank you.
N: The 3rd arm disappears. The gun falls. A BODY GUARD picks it up. WITH ARTHUR, FORD AND TRILLIAN
C: ARTHUR
D: Why do I get the feeling he's going to get us all killed?
C: FORD
D: Probably because it's very possible. Just don't save me, okay? We're even.
N: Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to the base of his torso.

N: PUSH IN ON HUMMA -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses.

D: I kept a few souvenirs from my former life. Ah, the heady days of space piracy... so young, so foolish..,
E: CONT'D
N: Another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma removes a PINK CUBE (like Zaphod's blue cube.)

C: HUMMA KAVULA
D: I need a hostage, something you hold dear. Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?
N: ON ZAPHOD'S SECOND HEAD -- peeping out of the collar looking terrified. Humma smiles. Bingo. He signals the guards. They grab Zaphod who looks back to Trillian, offers a weak smile.

An arrow points to Zaphod's Head 2 -- which is shouting... ZAPHOD HEAD 2 IDIOT! ZARKING MORON!! COME BACK!! YOU NEED ME!! COME BAAAAACKKKK!!!!

S: EXT. VILTVODLE 6. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
N: Zaphod, held aloft on Ford and Arthur's shoulders, staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the Heart of Gold is parked. His neck is wrapped with a blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.
C: ARTHUR
D: Are we sure this is the right way?
C: FORD
D: Yes! I think. I don't know. Maybe not.
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes, thank you for clearing that up.

C: ARTHUR
D: Tricia!

D: My instructions were clear...
N: From a slot in his chair, he pulls his instructions -- signed in triplicate of course. He reads...

C: ZAPHOD
D: Hey -- my third arm. I had one, didn't I?
C: ARTHUR
D: We have to go after her!
N: The computer fires to life, BLEEPS and BLIPS. Only now it has an effete, effeminate, almost matriarchal voice.
C: EDDIE
D: Boys, please! Not so rough. You're damaging my joystick.
N: They all look at the source of the voice, confused.
C: FORD
D: Who is that?
C: MARVIN
D: Ghastly, isn't it? I was asked to change the personality type, this was the emergency back-up.

C: ARTHUR
D: Can you change it back?
C: MARVIN
D: I can -- but I won't enjoy it.
C: EDDIE
D: I'm wait-ing...
N: Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to sleep instead -- with a contented smile. Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat normally reserved for the likes of Han Solo. He scans the console. Ford sits in the seat beside him.

We hear the sound of the pod approaching (but hold on the crab) as EEEOOOO-KA-KFFFZZZ! The crab runs back into the swamp. PAN LEFT to see the pod rammed into the ground, steam rising. The door opens.

N: Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of ELECTRONIC BERET, pulls it snugly onto Zaphod's head.

D: Okay, don't think of anything. Don't have ideas or theories -- nothing.
E: CONT'D
N: A beat. They all strain to think of nothing. Several paddles shoot up. Smacking them.

C: ZAPHOD
D: I have an idea. Run!
E: SMACK!
C: FORD
D: Ever the politician.
N: They take off running. A forest of paddle stalks erupts out of the ground around them, smacking violently. They come to rest at the side of a Vogon building.

C: EDDIE
D: Hi, fellas. Hold on to your hats!
E: back to his normal voice
C: ZAPHOD
D: Eddie! Welcome back!
N: The ship suddenly BLASTS forward. Their heads are slammed back into the seats as they VIBRATE VIOLENTLY.
C: FORD
D: WHAT'S HAPPENING, ZAPHOD?! WHERE DID YOU TELL IT TO GO?!
C: ZAPHOD
D: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!
N: Arthur looks to the console and sees the two mice sliding across it, getting thrown across the ship. They continue to vibrate -- even more violently.
C: FORD
D: ARE YOU SURE WE REATTACHED THIS THING THE RIGHT WAY?!
N: Zaphod is all smiles, hanging on as if he were on a rollercoaster ride.
C: ZAPHOD
D: ISN'T IT GREAT?!
N: DEEP SPACE-- ...the H.O.G. is but a blur as it streaks along. BACK IN THE H.O.G. - LATER Stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace.
C: EDDIE
D: Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma Z8B530.
N: Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and moves away from the console. A planet appears on screen. Zaphod and Ford lean forward.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Okay, that's it...I think. Computer? Is that...where are we headed again?
C: FORD
D: Magrathea?
C: EDDIE
D: Hang on, fella, and I'll check.
N: 8 74. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 3 CONTINUED: 83 Arthur turns, look over at... TRILLIAN -- who stares out a portal window into the emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek. Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say.
C: ARTHUR
D: Look, you're right. You deserved to know and I should've told you. I don't blame you if you're angry.
N: She turns and stares, wipes the tears away. Can't speak.
C: ARTHUR
D: Right. Anyway...I'm sorry.
E: CONT'D
C: EDDIE
D: Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee.
E: O.S.
N: Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Take us in.
E: tasting it
N: 83a EXT. NIGHT DEEP SPACE - MAGRATHEA 83a They all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which gets closer and closer. Suddenly, their faces are awash with light. Two suns rise behind the planet. It's breathtaking.
C: ZAPHOD
D: The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...
N: Marvin (both arms in tact) rises in the back, peers out.
C: MARVIN
D: It's rubbish.
N: 83b Suddenly,a ghostly white swirl of light, vaguely in the 83b shape of a man, appears on the screen before them.
C: GHOSTLY IMAGE
D: Greetings. This is a recorded announcement as we're all out the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. If you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted, kindly do so at the tone.
N: BEEP. Then stunned silence. 8 75. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 3b CONTINUED: 83b
C: ARTHUR
D: Closed? How can a planet be closed?
C: ZAPHOD
D: For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay, computer. Keep going. Take us down.
C: EDDIE
D: Happy to!
N: The ship eases forward. The image appears again.
C: GHOSTLY IMAGE
D: It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated. As a token of our appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles we've just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure on-going quality of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank you.
N: The image vanishes. A beat. Then...
C: EDDIE
D: Guys, I'm delighted to tell you there are two thermonuclear missiles headed right for us. Should I take evasive action?
N: 83c The screens show two huge rockets thundering at us, 83c Zaphod just smiles. Ford steps up.
C: FORD
D: Um...yes, computer. Evade!
N: Massive acceleration! An illuminated dome lowers from the ceiling over the crew seats - creating a safety pod.
S: EXT. ABOVE MAGRATHEA. DAWN
N: The Heart of Gold streaks away. Two large missiles follow and mimic the H.O.G.'s every move.
S: INT. THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: The crew are thrown from one side of the pod to the other.

D: There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems. Impact minus 45 seconds. Call me Eddie if it'll help you relax.
N: (84 cont) EXT. SKY OVER MAGRATHEA - CONTINUOUS (84 cont) The H.O.G. streaks forward. The missiles are gaining.

C: EDDIE
D: Sure thing, fellah. Handing over manual control. Good luck!
N: Big swell of Muzak. The ship drops like a stone. THE MISSILES -- miss, then turn in a screeching curve. (85 cont) INT. THE SAFETY POD - (85 cont) Zaphod tries to wrestle with three controls.
C: ZAPHOD
D: I can't do this without my other arm!
N: (84 cont) THE H.O.G. -- spirals wildly, missiles narrowly missing. (84 cont) (85 cont) IN THE SAFETY POD - everyone is thrown. (85 cont) (84 cont) IN THE SKY -- the missiles are dead ahead, shooting (84 cont) straight for us. (85 cont) IN THE SAFETY POD-- (85 cont)
C: ZAPHOD
D: Did we lose them?
C: FORD
D: No. They're right behind us.
N: He looks down, sees the IMPROBABILITY DRIVE BUTTON.
C: ARTHUR
D: Look, why don't I just hit this thing?
C: ZAPHOD
D: NO! We're here! No telling where it will send us!
N: (84 cont) IN THE SKY-- (84 cont) The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster. (85 cont) ON THE BRIDGE-- (85 cont) They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass lid.
C: ZAPHOD
D: NO!
N: Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON. WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing madness!
S: EXT. SPACE. - NIGHT
N: Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS. 8 77. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03
S: 7 INT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 87
N: It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact same place they were - dazed.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Um...where are we?
C: TRILLIAN
D: Exactly where we were, I think.
C: ZAPHOD
D: And the missiles?
C: FORD
D: Have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale.
N: He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by.
C: EDDIE
D: At an improbability factor of eight million, seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to one against.
N: They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even? He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile.
C: ARTHUR
D: I could really use a cup of tea.
S: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
N: The H.O.G. arches away. The whale in mid-air, stops rising, starts falling.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: It is important to note that suddenly, and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more. This is what it thought as it fell.
N: The camera moves around the whale as it falls. 8 78. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 4 CONTINUED: 84
C: WHALE
D: Ahhhh!!!! What's happening? Excuse me! Who am I? Hello? Why am I here? What's my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? What is this 'I' that I want to know what it is? Calm down, get a grip now ... ooh! This is an interesting sensation...
E: V.O.
N: ANGLE: From below. The whale is wriggling a bit.
C: WHALE
D: Oh! This is an interesting sensation, what is it? It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in ... well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite strong now. And hey,what's this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do. Perhaps I can give it a better name later when I've found out what it's for! It must be very important because there certainly seems to be an awful lot of it. Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call it a tail - yeah! Tail!
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight.
C: WHALE
D: Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good, can't I? Wow! Wow! Doesn't seem to achieve much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on. How. Have I built up a coherent picture of things yet? No. Never mind. Hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, ao much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation ... Or is it the wind? There really is an awful lot of that now, isn't there?
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: It's eye tries to look down. Camera pulls back from the whale, abandoning it ...
C: WHALE
D: And hey! What's this thing coming suddenly coming towards me very fast, so big and flat and round it needs a big wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round ... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if it'll be friends with me?
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: We hear a sickening thud o.s. 8 79. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 4 CONTINUED: 84
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was "Oh no, not again."
N: We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING.
C: GUIDE VOICE
D: Many have speculated that if we knew why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.
E: CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. HEART OF GOLD. MAGRATHEA SURFACE - DAY
N: The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the H.O.G. parked in the b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it -- along with a few petunias. They all grimace. BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks, aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight. They walk toward it.
S: EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY
N: Arthur walks behind the others, his head down.
C: FORD
D: Hey...this looks familiar.
E: O.S.
N: Arthur looks up, registers surprise. THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer. The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN
T: DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS"
C: FORD (CONT'D}
D: Must be portal doors.
C: ARTHUR
D: You mean -- the hippies were right?
N: In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH." Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone. Trillian and Ford follow. Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob, anything. He must've hit something because the front of the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Okay. In we go.
N: 9 80. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 0 CONTINUED: 90
C: ARTHUR
D: What?! Are you out of what's left of your mind? We can't step into that...that.
C: FORD
D: We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the right one, we come back and pick another. No biggie.
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the last door we ever step through? What if it rips us into tiny little atomic particle...thingies.
N: Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere, covers her ears - trying to block them out
C: ZAPHOD
D: It's the right one. I have a hunch.
C: ARTHUR
D: Ford..?
C: FORD
D: He's got good hunches. I say we go.
C: ARTHUR
D: Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? Are you insane?!
C: ZAPHOD
D: Hey, I think I resent that.
C: ARTHUR
D: I don't care what you think you think...
N: They all start arguing over each other. We focus on Trillian -- Anger and frustration building, she covers her ears -- then screams....
C: TRILLIAN
D: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
N: And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery? They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex. She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a rung mop, then sucked inside. Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air. Ford is semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.
C: ZAPHOD
D: That's supposed to happen...I think.
N: Ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a scarf and dives through. Same thing. Bent, twisted... 9 81. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 0 CONTINUED: (2) 90
C: ZAPHOD
D: Hey, wait for me!
E: CONT'D
N: He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in. Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.
C: ARTHUR
D: No. No! NOOO!!!
N: He bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like Zaphod did, desperately looking for a way to open it. He collapses and buries his head in his hands.
C: MARVIN
D: I told you this would all end in tears.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a cobblestone street. Zaphod's body falls to the ground next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright beside them. Trillian is already heading down the street toward the Temple. Ford and Zaphod hurry to catch up to her.
S: EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY
N: Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.
C: ARTHUR
D: Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?
C: MARVIN
D: Don't talk to me about life.
C: ARTHUR
D: Here I am, God knows how far from home...
C: MARVIN
D: Don't talk to me about God.
C: ARTHUR
D: ...and this is where I see the most spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on. We only had the one sun at home. Planet called Earth.
N: 9 82. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 2 CONTINUED: 92
C: MARVIN
D: I know. You keep going on about it. It sounds awful.
C: ARTHUR
D: Oh no, it's beautiful. Or at least, it was...
C: MARVIN
D: Did it have oceans?
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes. Great wide rolling blue oceans.
C: MARVIN
D: Can't bear oceans.
N: Arthur looks up at Marvin.
C: ARTHUR
D: So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on a dead planet -- with a manically depressed robot.
C: MARVIN
D: You think you've got problems? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Excuse me.
E: 0.S.
N: Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES.
C: ARTHUR
D: Aah!
N: He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.
C: ARTHUR
D: Who are you?
E: CONT'D
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: My name is not important.
N: Arthur continues to scramble away from the man.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: You must come with me. Terrible events are afoot. You must come or you'll be late.
E: CONT'D
C: ARTHUR
D: Late? What for?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: What is your name, Earthman?

D: Dent. Arthur Dent.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Late as in "the late Dentarthurdent." It's a sort of threat you see. Never been much good at them myself, but I'm told they can be terribly effective.
N: He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom."
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Your friends are safe. You can trust me.
E: CONT'D
C: ARTHUR
D: Trust a man who won't tell me his name?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: My name? Very well... My name is...Slartibartfast.
E: heaves a sigh, reluctant
N: Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: I said it wasn't important.
E: CONT'D
N: Slartibartfast motions to the door. He looks to Marvin.
C: MARVIN
D: I could calculate your chances of survival -- but you won't like it.
N: Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: I must warn you. We are about to pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It may disturb you. It scares the willies out of me.
N: He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you. Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.
C: ARTHUR
D: Whaa!
N: He is bent, twisted and sucked away. Slarti follows. Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to... 92a THE SKY-- 92a where the fleet of Vogon ships has now arrived.
C: MARVIN
D: Funny how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.

N: Arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: I told you you might find it a bit disturbing.
C: ARTHUR
D: I have found this whole day a bit disturbing.
N: Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices... ...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only instead of cars there are models of various planets.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Did you know we built planets?
N: No. Arthur didn't know that. He looks perplexed.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines was always my favorite. Used to have endless fun doing all the little fiddly bits round fjords. But the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom- built planets are something of a luxury commodity... At any rate, there's been a terrible mix up with your planet. You must come with me or it's all going to blow up in our faces. The best laid plans of mice, you know...
E: CONT'D getting back on subject
C: ARTHUR
D: ...and men.

D: I don't think men have got much to do with it.
N: Arthur looks confused. Slarti motions him to a door. Arthur readies his towel at his mouth as Slarti hits a button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT CARTS move past -- like a kids ride at Disneyland. They step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart MOVES through a curtain, out into DEEP SPACE. PULL BACK - till the cart is no more than a speck being pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.
S: INT. - PLANET FACTORY - NIGHT

S: INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT -- CONTINUOUS
N: Ford, Zaphod and Trillian enter the dimly lit temple. They hear a faint, tinny sound. They follow it. FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR... The sound gets louder. Tinny music. And laughter... Flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.
C: ZAPHOD
D: This is it!
N: He quickens his pace. Trillian and Ford follow. They round the corner to find... DEEP THOUGHT -- sitting there majestically. The TINNY MUSIC emanates from somewhere near him. Zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of the TINNY MUSIC. Deep Thought is watching TV. A violent, stupid cartoon.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Deep Thought...!
E: CONT'D
C: DEEP THOUGHT
D: Shhh. This is a good bit.

D: Ask your companion.

C: ZAPHOD
D: Great. This is just great. Let's go find something else for my entire life to be about.
N: He starts to march off. Ford grabs his arm.
C: FORD
D: Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us for? We have to get it. You gave the guy your head.
C: ZAPHOD
D: I know. Why did I do that?
N: He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns...
C: FORD
D: Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have a g...
N: Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A robotic arm pushes it forward. Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away, CORRIDOR LEADING AWAY FROM DEEP THOUGHT Ford hands Zaphod the gun.
C: FORD
D: Here. Take it. I don't do guns.
E: CONT'D
N: Zaphod takes it with a smile...
C: ZAPHOD
D: Thank you.
N: ...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has happened.

N: The transport cart moves past two half-finished planets and on toward a 3rd planet. Construction gantries and clouds obscure our view.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you see. Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that. No one doing the boring jobs.
C: ARTHUR
D: Oh, you had that problem, too?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: In spades. So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax inspectors, traffic wardens, government officials. We were commissioned to build a special planet for them. Problem was, some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face.
C: ARTHUR
D: What? You did that? I've been there!

C: ZAPHOD
D: Why so edgy?
N: She can't believe he's asking this. She aims the gun, CLICK!
C: ZAPHOD
D: Of course you're edgy, your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around the Galaxy with the guy who signed the order
E: CONT'D
N: CLICK. She shoots him again.
C: ZAPHOD
D: You actually wanted to know the Question because you always thought there was more to life, and now you're crushed because you find out there really isn't.
E: CONT'D
N: She's getting angrier and more hurt. CLICK.
C: ZAPHOD
D: You've got no home, no family, no one to be with -- and you're stuck with me, another in a long line of men who doesn't appreciate you because he's too busy appreciating himself.
E: CONT'D
N: Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes to well with tears. She lowers the gun. Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off. But he realizes what he said and doesn't like it.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Give me that thing.
E: CONT'D
N: He grabs the gun, points it at her.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Won't affect me. I'm already a woman.
N: Before he can react, A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES BEHIND THEM. They turn, shielding their eyes.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Uh oh -- oh. It's okay, it's only a couple of...
N: FLASH! KEEEOOOW! They are engulfed in WHITE LIGHT. BACK TO:
S: EXT. DEEP SPACE (FACTORY FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS
N: The transport cart continues toward the 3rd planet.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Here we are, then. Look familiar?
N: Arthur turns and looks. There before him is... 1 91. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 O1a EARTH -- Arthur is thunderstruck...then confused. 101a
C: ARTHUR
D: So -- it wasn't destroyed?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Actually, it was. This is a back-up. Earth Mark II.
C: ARTHUR
D: So you're saying you ... made the Earth?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Well, not me alone. It was a group effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard of a place, I think it's called Norway?
N: 101b Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds, towards 101b Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: That was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry to hear about it being blown up. Shocking cock up. The mice were furious.
E: CONT'D
C: ARTHUR
D: Mice? Who cares about bloody mice?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Are you a fan of plate tectonics?
N: Arthur looks up. Slartibartfast points down. 101c ANOTHER MAN pushes a button causing mountains to spring 101c up noisily.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Voila! Himalayas. Good, eh?
E: CONT'D
N: Arthur is working very hard to process all this. 101d JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses 101d a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Earthman, you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was built. Ten minutes later, we would have been free and clear. But we gave them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to retrieve this back-up copy. And they've brought you with them.
E: CONT'D
N: The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean. 1 92. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 01d CONTINUED: 101d
C: ARTHUR
D: They brought...I'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: These creatures you call "mice" are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese must've been a front. They were experimenting on you, you see. A vast computer program...
C: ARTHUR
D: Ah. I see where you're confused. You see -- we were experimenting on them.
N: 101e Over the ocean, a "Perfect Storm" wave rolls toward them. 101e
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Oh, I gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there. But you were actually elements in the computer program. They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.
E: looking down
N: 101f They move toward the white cliffs of Dover. A man stands 101f on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it.
C: ARTHUR
D: So -- you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep Thought designed the Earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: That's bureaucracy for you.
C: ARTHUR
D: Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ...
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that.
S: EXT. EARTH II. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS
N: A & S swoop down and soar over the English countryside -- partially constructed; tall tree stocks with branch and leaves lying beside them, waiting to be attached. Men rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc. 1 93. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 02 CONTINUED: 102
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired, but I always think that the chances of finding out what's really going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy than right any day.
C: ARTHUR
D: And are you?
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: No. That's where it all falls down of course. Here we are, then.
E: slowing the platform
N: l03 The platform slows to a stop. Arthur steps out and is 103 stunned to see... HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his house alright.
C: ARTHUR
D: Is this...?
N: Slartibartfast nods. Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward the house. 103a INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 - CONTINUOUS 103a Arthur enters his house. There is no furniture, no photographs or books or any evidence of his existence there. He feels the walls, the countertops. He's home?
C: TRILLIAN
D: Arthur!
E: O.S.
N: Arthur pokes his head around a wall to find... FORD, ZAPHOD AND TRILLIAN -- sitting at an elegantly set table -- stuffing their faces with a meal fit for a king. 103a INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 - 103a
C: ARTHUR
D: What -- what are you doing? What happened to you?
N: They talk while continuing to stuff food in their mouths.
C: FORD
D: Funniest thing. Our hosts attacked us with Dismodulating Anti Phase Stun Mist then brought us to this amazing meal as a way to make it up to us . Try the mutton. It's fantastic.
E: chew, chew chew, chew chew, chew
N: 1 94. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: 103a
C: ZAPHOD
D: Zarking incredible.
E: mouth full
N: They can't seem to stop eating, like they've been drugged.
C: ARTHUR
D: Hosts attack you --? And then you sit down for -- is that tea?
N: Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip, Closes his eyes, enjoying it.
C: ARTHUR
D: Now that's a cup of tea.
E: CONT'D
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: We're glad you like it, Earth creature.
E: O.S.
N: He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a silver platter.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: After ten million years on Earth, and a rather large chunk of that time in England, it would be utterly humiliating if we didn't know how to make a decent pot of tea.
N: Arthur stares in shock...can't speak.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse and Franky mouse . They control a large sector of the Universe in our dimension . I'm sorry, I thought you were told about the mice...
E: chew, chew chew, chew
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it.
N: He steadies himself on the table.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Sit, Earthman. Eat.
N: Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the end slides backward.
C: ARTHUR
D: In a moment, perhaps. I can't seem to let go of this table.
N: Slartibartfast steps forward. 1 95. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: (2) 103a
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Pardon the interruption, but I'll just be getting back to work now.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Smarty fart blast?
E: cracking up, like he's stoned
C: BENJY/FRANKY
D: Eat!
C: ZAPHOD
D: Right.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: It looks like we won't be needing the new Earth after all, now that we've found the only living native of the planet.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: But...they've nearly finished the oceans.
C: FRAHKY MOUSE
D: That will be all, Slartibartfast.
N: Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.
C: ARTHUR
D: I'm sorry, when you say "the only living native" -- do you mean me? What about her?
N: Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on the ship. She's half-native. Her real father was a Blahardid, the hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet Olbed, who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one Ms. Francis McMillan.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Which explains a lot.
E: looking up, mouth full
N: She goes back to eating. Arthur is taking this all in.
C: ARTHUR
D: So -- mostly harmless and me. That's it.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: We're sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly, but once we learned you were the only full-blooded Earthling in the universe, it was important that we get you here by any means necessary.
N: 1 96. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: (3) 103a
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: We've spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question, and the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me to no end. Which is why you're here.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Sit, Earthling. Sit.
N: Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him.
C: BENJY/FRANKY
D: NOT THERE!
N: Arthur jumps. The others look up. Benjy and Franky cover their outburst with a smile.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: This chair is much more -- comfortable.
N: Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Drink.
E: CONT'D
N: He slides the cup of tea over. Arthur takes a sip.
C: ARTHUR
D: Mmmm. This really is delicious.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Good. Glad you like it. Now -- to business.
N: Ford and Zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors.
C: FORD/ZAPHOD
D: To business!
N: Benjy and Franky fire them a look.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Sorry. Thought you were proposing a toast.
C: BENJY/FRANKY
D: EAT!
N: Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting the hill.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: About this Ultimate Question. You see, we've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're very much inclined to take it.
N: 1 97. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: (4) 103a
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: But - and here's the point - we have to have product. Which means we still need an ultimate question.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.
C: FRANKY HOUSE
D: Yes. Got to sound good.
C: ARTHUR
D: An Ultimate Question that sounds good... From a couple of mice...for a chat show.
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: And as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain. Which is why we need it. More tea?
N: Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a little woozy. Did he hear them right?
C: ARTHUR
D: I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain?
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Yes. To extract the question.
C: ARTHUR
D: You can't have my brain. I'm using it.
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: Barely.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: We can replace it if you think it's important. An electronic brain maybe.
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: A simple one should suffice. Who would know the difference?
C: ARTHUR
D: I would!
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: No, you wouldn't. We could program you not to.
N: Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles.
C: ARTHUR
D: Ford! Zaphod! TRILLIAN!!
N: 1 98. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: (5) 103a They're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it.
C: ARTHUR
D: What are they-- what's in the food?! WHAT WAS IN THAT TEA!?
E: CONT'D
N: The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.
N: The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur. Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away. Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.
C: ARTHUR
D: Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING MINUTE!!
N: The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop eating and listen.
C: ARTHUR
D: You want the question that goes with the answer "42" How about "What's six times seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one, "How many roads must a man walk down?"
E: CONT'D
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Hey, that's not bad.
N: Through the opposite window (in much the same way bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons arriving.
C: ARTHUR
D: Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?
N: He shakes his head.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: We don't want to be happy. We want to be rich.
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: Take his brain.
N: 1 99. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: (6) 103a Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to their feet.
C: BENJY MOUSE
D: Shoot him!!
N: They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy. Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.
C: FRANKY MOUSE
D: Oh, shit.
N: Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat. The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze, Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick.
N: Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down the hill toward the house. He leans over the table, bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND. ON THE HILL JUST BEYOND -- An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it. Amongst them... MARVIN -- marches as well, a gun held to his head.
C: MARVIN
D: I must warn you, I'm feeling very depressed.
E: to the Vogon
C: KWALTZ
D: Mr. President! We are here for your protection!
N: Zaphod appears at the front door and waves Presidentially.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Thank you!
N: The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others flee as the barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun, goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead? BEHIND THE TRUCK -- FORD looks at MARVIN lying face down in the dirt - his head emitting smoke. 1 100. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 06 CONTINUED: 106

D: Okay -- that thing I said about not saving my life because we're even? Scratch that. Save at will.
C: TRILLIAN
D: We need that gun.
C: ZAPHOD
D: We need tighter gun control!
E: campaign sound-byte
C: FORD
D: We need his other head. Okay -- I'll create a distraction.
E: an idea
N: He holds up his towel.
C: ARTHUR
D: Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.
E: sarcastic
C: FORD
D: You know -- I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying.
E: squinting at Arthur
N: More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards... ...THE VOGON POLICE FORCE -- who see him coming, his towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.
C: FORD
D: AHHHHHHHH!!!!
E: CONT'D
N: The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Now!
N: She and Arthur both run out toward the gun.
C: ARTHUR TRILLIAN
D: I thought I was...what are I thought I was...I'll get you... get back... okay it... you already... fine, fine... fine
N: They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes...
C: QUESTULAR
D: It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!! GET HIM!!
N: The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP. The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS. 1 101. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 08 CONTINUED: 108 The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang. Ford looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks forward, sees Marvin raising the gun.
C: FORD
D: Duck!
C: ZAPHOD
D: Where?
N: He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as... MARVIN FIRES THE POV GUN, Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.
C: VOGON POLICE FORCE
D: Oh what's the point?
E: in unison
N: They turn their weapons on themselves and... ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up. 108a All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the ground 108a including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing. He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his head. He drops to his knees.
C: QUESTULAR
D: Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.
N: Zaphod takes the gun, fires it at Questular. He rises -- and paints on a big smile.
C: QUESTULAR (CONT'D}
D: What am I so pissed off about? I'm great? I'm zarking incredible! Everyone loves me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at me...etc.
N: Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his clothes and jumps in.
C: ZAPHOD
D: Marvin. You saved our lives.
C: MARVIN
D: I know. Wretched, isn't it?
C: QUESTULAR
D: Oh man! I love being me!!

N: Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes. Me.
N: He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow. Really? She smiles.
C: TRILLIAN
D: Let's go somewhere.
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes, You name it. I'll go.
C: ZAPHOD
D: I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.
C: FORD
D: And I'm hungry. After we get your head let's grab a bite. I know this great restaurant at the end of the universe.
N: As they walk away, we CUT TO... SLARTI'S FACTORY ELEVATOR -- where they all board.
C: SLARTIBARTFAST
D: Okay. Hold tight.
N: Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go.
C: VOICE
D: Stand-by for commencement of life cycle. All systems checked and cleared. Commencing.
E: O.S.
N: We hear KL-KLUNK. BZZZZZZZ... and watch nature burst into life - animals run - flowers bloom - waterfalls cascade - mountains rise in the mist - monkeys bathe in hot springs etc. Set to a wonderful, uplifting piece of music ("WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD?"). Tilt up to the sky. The day turns to night. Stars appear. The Heart of Gold streaks through the stars. THE END
