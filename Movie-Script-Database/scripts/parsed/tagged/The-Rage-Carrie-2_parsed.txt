N: "I wish that I could write you a melody so plain That would save you dear lady from going insane" Bob Dylan, Tombstone Blues BLACK MUSIC UP: Slow, sad, ethereal. Perhaps even eerie.
T: FADE IN:
N: On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without waves or ripples. A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint. The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood. FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal...
S: INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out. A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can, then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall: until it reaches &pleated drape -- -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.
C: A PUPPY,
D: a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird. The dog looks over to...
C: A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
D: standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the verge of tears.
N: The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral, forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame. Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel to the floor, extending around a modest living room. Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn, haggard- She hasn't slept in a while. The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a little frightening. RACHEL Mommy BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip. This is a very careful line.
C: RACHEL
D: Momma, come play with me. In my room. But her mother keeps painting across a door.
C: RACHEL
D: Right now, mommy, okay? BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's
C: RACHEL
D: I got a idea, we could-- -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush
C: THE KITCHEN
D: A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a wheep whe ep siren, then:
N: AMBULANCE VOICE (CANNED; TINNY) If you need help, dial nine one one. If you need help, dial nine one one.
C: A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
D: RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1. BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background.
C: RACHEL
D: Hello? It's my mom. She's doing some... some wrong things. She's doing wrong things, so, and, you should come.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT
N: A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE Its dashing red lights CRUISER with its doors flung open. splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and robes, watching... TWO E.M.S. WORKERS drag a struggling BARBARA across a lawn, her hands in plastic restraining cuffs. A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a poncho over her head.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Rachel? Rachel, are you okay? She keeps staring off, watching her mother being stuffed into the ambulance.
C: RACHEL
D: Momma! She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Honey, she just has to go somewhere, to get some rest, so she'll feel better. As the AMBULANCE pulls away, RACHEL catches a glimpse of her mother in the rear windows, watching her.
C: POLICEMAN
D: is your dad around? When's he get home from work? I don't have a dad. The POLICEMAN collects himself.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Okay. Then we're going to take you someplace nice, with a family, a really nice family, till we get all this sorted out.
N: (QUIETLY) No. POLICMIAN WE'LL JUS
C: RACHEL
D: She breaks free, races into.
S: INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside, as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it -- SLAMS by itself, right in his face. FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.
C: HER ROOM
D: She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To her left... A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into
C: A CLOSET
D: where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms. The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.
C: FROM ABOVE
D: In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy. There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: NT. A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her shoulder blade. Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it. There's a knock on her bedroom door.
C: WOMAN

T: FADE INTO:
N: A PAN AROUND RACHEL'S ROOM the usual teenage mess, clothes strewn everywhere. A POSTER of Jim Morrison reads: "No One Here Gets Out Alive." RACHEL stands before her dresser mirror, in a ratty bathrobe, putting on a small nose stud. She dons her daily armor -- -- Slipping on multiple earrings. -- Applying Kohl around her eyes. -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate captioned "Manson Sucks". -- Disheveling her long black hair. Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open ground floor window. Sorry, Walt. And gently lowers him outside.
S: EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING
N: It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is run down and in the section of town where people have cars in their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is overgrown, there's broken glass on the street.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
N: The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house. EMILYN, 40's, is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter. A groggy BOYD, 40's, enters, he's a trucker and looks like one.

E: lowers her eyes, mumbles
C: EMILYN
D: Your mom's making progress isn't she, on the new medicacions, the tricyclics?
C: RACHEL
D: Yes, ma'am.
N: (BEAT) May I be excused? Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl. (casually, a routine) And you should take that thing outta your nose. Don't you have enough holes in your head? As she turns away, RACHEL makes a face, but replies.
C: RACHEL
D: Yes, sir.
S: EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
N: RACHEL stands outside, clad in a long dark overcoat, with a black backpack. WALTER sits next to her, behind a fence. A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up.
C: RACHEL
D: Later, Walt. On WALTER, bummed.
C: WITHIN THE SCHOOL BUS
D: A gaggle of young KIDS in faded denims and pastels. RACHEL moves to the back, sits with LISA PARKER, who could be her younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal. LISA has a HEART-THORN TATTOO around her arm, like RACHEL's.
N: LISA (SMILES) Well, hullo.

S: EXT. BERGEN HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

C: CRUSH CARLIN FRIDAY!
D: The school mascot, a scrappy BULLDOG wearing a CROWN tilted at a rakish angle, is also drawn on the banner. FADE IN -- KNOTS of STUDENTS, like spectral figures. The two major school cliques are... on the front steps. Land of burnouts, step-kids, Metalheat s skateboard junkiei-and other lost souls. A STONER KID kicks his skateboard up and catches it. HIS BUDDY follows suit and misses, suffering the embarrassment of watching his board shoot down the steps whose metal rail separates Freak Hall and..,
C: THE PATIO
D: a courtyard with concrete tables where the school's royalty hold court. The cleancut "Patio People" are the jocks, student government types and others who have no idea what it is to be alone on a Saturday night. At the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter jackets reading "Bulldogs", some sport caps marked "Dawgs: There's JESSE RYAN, handsome, longish hair, a young Eddie Vedor if Eddie ever played football. Next to him is... MARK BING, good looking, with a body like a fist. Behind them, arrayed around a concrete table are the large, doltish BRAD, hearty rich boy CHUCK, and the arrogant ERIC. CHUCKS looks over a plain looking GIRL on the Patio.
C: CHUCK
D: Hey, Mark, the girl over there, how many if I do her?
E: aside, low
N: Six. BRAD (MIFFED) Hold it. I did her last week, I only got five.
C: MARK
D: She was having a bad hairday. A group of PATIO GIRLS sit at another table. Among them is MONICA, a stunning brunette, AMY a cute redhead and TRACY, an icy BLONDE who could spend all day checking her makeup. JESSE looks over. TRACY graces him with a smile and turns away. MARK leans in to JESSE.
C: MARK
D: Hey, Jess. Tracy, she wants you, man. Jump her bones.
C: I JESSE
D: Yeah, whatever.
C: CHUCK
D: What's the matter with you, she's got an ass stamped "Made in Heaven
C: JESSE
D: I don't know, you ever have a conversation with her? It's like talking down a well. She only wants me cause I'm on the football team.
C: MARK
D: So what? You want her to want you cause of your dazzling personality? Look, you want someone to talk to, you got us. H, you screw.
C: THE SCHOOL BUS
D: RACHEL and LISA hop off and walk past the Patio. CHUCK watches LISA pass.
N: CHUCK (ASIDE) Woof- Coyote date.
C: JESSE
D: That's harsh, man, keep it down.
C: ERIC
D: What's a coyote date?
C: MARK
D: When you wake up in the morning, and she's sleeping on your arm, and the only way to get up is to wake her. So you gnaw your arm off instead. BRAD snorts a laugh. A goatee'd ENGLISH TEACHER nods to both camps as he passes.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Hello Montagues, hello Capulets. A BELL goes off and the STUDENTS start filing into school. LISA waves the tips of her fingers to RACHEL, bye-bye. RACHEL looks over, catches a glimpse of JESSE, across the line of demarcation. For a piece of a second it seems as if he's looking back. She drops her head, walks away.
S: INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
N: The ENGLISH TEACHER strolls among the student's desk. RACHEL is in social Siberia, sitting in the back.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Okay, then how many saw the movie? A show of hands, all the girls, some of the boys.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Now, how many read the play?
C: AS ASSIGN
D: A few tentative hands, including JESSE.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: I thank you for your honesty, but I am saddened. I'd like to think we're here to study William Shakespeare, not worship at the altar of Leo DiCaprio. Scattered laughs.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: I was going to calk about the language. But since you haven't Z&&d the language, let's talk about the plot.
N: Sighs of relief
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Romeo and Juliet, a tale of two lovers meant for each other, pulled apart by their families, society, and, some might say, by fate.
N: (BEAT) Why is it that we are so moved by love stories that end with separation? The STUDENT' s faces are blank.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: What are some other stories with this theme?
N: (NO RESPONSES) How about, Dr. Zhivago? Casablanca? Still blank. AMY timidly raises her hand.
C: AMY
D: You meair like in Dumb and when the girl's husband showed up? The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Okay, well. Perhaps at some level we know that Lauren Holly's husband AIM to show up? What say? Anyone?
N: (BEAT) Rachel? I don't know that I believe in it.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Believe in what?
C: RACHEL
D: Love. JESSE looks at her, pensive.
N: ENGLISH TEACHER (SYMPATHETIC) Well, then you've got bigger problems than passing this crass.
C: ARNIE
D: Love is fifteen seconds of squishing noises. Unquote. Johnny Rotten. Scattered laughs. JESSE overhears TRACY as she nods at RACHEL, whispers to AMY...
E: raises his hand
C: TRACY
D: Who would love her?
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Do you think that all love stories are tragedies? I mean, unless they die at the same time, all lovers are eventually separated by death.
C: JESSE
D: Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a tragedy, because the only way they could really be together was in death.
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Very good. A foul cynic, most cliche. A true romantic, how refreshing. Kids scoff at JESSE, but RACHEL eyes JESSE, struck by this side of him. The BELL rings and ARNIE leads the exodus.
E: nods at Rachel turns to Jesse
C: ARNIE
D: Food!
C: ENGLISH TEACHER
D: Next assignment, Brave New World, the book, not the TV movie.

He catches a pass, but two DEFENSIVE BACKS converge on him and he gets bone-jarringly plastered. JESSE hits the ground with such force his helmet flies off. For a moment, it looks like he's been decapitated. RACHEL (STANDS) Jess! THE HOMETOWN CROWD rises to their feet as... JESSE stays down, hurt.
C: RACHEL
D: Oh, no. RACHEL strains to see him as the team circles around JESSE.

C: RACHEL
D: What?
C: BRAD
D: The one you played.
C: MARK
D: Yeah, yeah, what was the score? Chuckie, pass me the scoreboard, I wanna show Rachel how she helped Jesse win the game. CHUCK pulls the BLACK NOTEBOOK next to the CD's off a shelf, pretends he's a quarterback hiking a ball. Twenty-four, twenty-six, hut, hut, hut. He drops back to pass the NOTEBOOK.
C: CHUCK
D: Go long, Bradzilla. MARK laughs as BRAD circles around RACHEL, twists between other dancers. CHUCK tosses the NOTEBOOK over RACHEL and BRAD leaps up to catch it.
C: BRAD
D: Post-pattern, Mark! Ducking around DANCERS, MARK raises his hands for the pass. KIDS start to notice their antics and start laughing. BRAD passes the book over to MARK who catches it, mimes spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance. MONICA laughs and turns to RACHEL, who laughs, even though she still looks a bit befuddled.
C: MARK
D: Rachel, catch! He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.
N: BEHIND RACHEL -- THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights, but suddenly there's an almost subliminal -- FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES. RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK, unsure of what to do with it. The boys are a little out of breath, but still grinning and dancing.
C: MARK
D: Open it. Go 'head, read off the scores.
C: BRAD
D: Start with Eric.
C: CHUCK
D: Yeah, start with poor Eric. She opens the book, looks at the pages with a quizzical expression. She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the page with lists of girls beneath each one. Every girl has a number next to her with a total at the bottom.
C: MARK
D: What's Eric's score?
C: RACHEL
D: Twenty-two? RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.
C: MARK
D: What's up, Rach? You know someone on that list?
C: RACHEL
D: Lisa.
E: under her breath
C: MARK
D: Oh, yeah, Lisa, forgot about her.
C: CHUCK
D: How many points was she?

C: MARK
D: Rach, look under Jesses's name, how many points you get?
N: MONICA (CHEERLEADING) Two, four, six, eight--
C: AMY
D: Who do we appreciate! RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten.
C: MARK
D: No, more than that, remember, we thought Rach was a dyke. He got extra-points for the conversion.
C: BRAD
D: points? Try thirty. RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of it.
C: MONICA
D: Look at her face, this is priceless. At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV.
C: ERIC
D: Hey, man, what did the scout say? Behind Rte... THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments appear of...
N: A COUPLE MAKING LOVE -- from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the boy is JESSE. DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's going on behind her.
C: MARK
D: See, we didn't think Jess could do i so he offered to get evidence, proof that he'd scored you.
C: MONICA
D: Here comes Jesse's big play!
C: MARK
D: Lookie, lookie, Rachel. RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her, then laughing at her. She turns and sees... The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV. Her face goes slack with horror.
C: RACHEL
D: Oh, God MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE.
C: MARK
D: Jess was disappointed with the picture quality, but I told him it was better than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape.
C: CK
D: Rach, was it good for you too? Sure looks like it, don't it?
C: MARK
D: Why don't we ask Jesse? He turns and calls out.
C: MARK
D: Hey, Jesse! Over here! JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her
E: CONT'D
C: JESSE
D: What... JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck.
C: TRACY
D: He told me he was thinking of me when he fucked you.
N: Seeing MARK laughing, JESSE realizes what's going on.
C: JESSE
D: Rachel... He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms and pull him back into the crowd.
C: JESSE
D: Rachel! MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD.
C: MARK
D: Rachel! Rachel! She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting. Rachel!
C: MONICA
D: Rachel! Rachel! Drowning out JESSE's cries. RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS, smirking and pointing at her.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
C: FAST CLOSE-UPS
D: of RACHEL and JESSE making love. The assault of music, chanting and images crescendo with... BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO forcing her to face the TV screen.
C: BRAD
D: Hey, is that a zit on your ass? RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time since she was four years old. She bows her head.
C: A LAUGHING BRAD
D: glances down at RACHEL's arm. The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging up her arm. He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and...
C: THE HEART TATTOO
D: on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm.
C: BRAD
D: Holy shit. He releases her. RACHEL raises her head, eyes glowing with pain and rage, her broken heart turned to stone., The delicate THORN VINE has grown across her chin, cheekbone and forehead, swirling around to end on her other cheek. A stunned BRAD backs away from her. JESSE breaks free of ERIC's grip, slugs CHUCK and pushes his way towards RACHEL. Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and sees JESSE coming at her, his arms out to take her in his embrace.
C: A KNIFE
D: on the bar dances and rattles, then... A WHIP PAN finds... JESSE, as his back arches in pain and he screams. The KNIFE embedded in his open palm, nailing his hand to the wall. MARK and the other boys stare in shock.
C: MARK
D: What the fuck? ON JESSE -- as he screams again. A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand, at waist level. The SCREW spins around, burrowing into his flesh.
N: Everyone on that side of the room stops dead, taking in the bizarre sight. RACHEL straightens up and... The kitchen door CLOSES... The glass doors to the back yard slide SHUT... The front door SLAMS. TRACY (LOOKING AROUND) What's going on Mark? I dunno. The floor starts to shake like a small earthquake. All the PARTYGOERS go still, looking around at each other. The room is frozen, even though the music keeps pounding. MARK looks at RACHEL, her disheveled hair partially obscures her features, but her eyes are glowing.
C: THE GLASS WINDOWS
D: surrounding the room, begin to RATTLE, then CRACK in a spider- web pattern. Then... THE WINDOWS BURST inward. FOLLOW the deadly hail of shards as they cut through the
C: CROWD.
D: FROM ABOVE -- The outer edge of the CROWD are mowed down as if by a machine gun and... A WHIP PAN -- Finds a BOY impaled by a large, jagged shard.
C: TWISTED SHADOWS
D: are splayed across a wall of KIDS falling to the ground. The hard-edged music keeps playing while... CHUCK's decapitated head rolls across the floor and onto... A plate. The BEEFY BOY spins around, clutcning at a shard protruding from his neck, his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn sprinkler.
N: On a GIRL as his blood sprays across her face and... The BOY turns, arcing blood across... The Jackson Pollock PAINTING, which blends into the multi- colored canvas. Reeling into the stereo, the BOY scatters CDs everywhere. On RACHEL, clothes spattered red, tears streaming down her cheeks. TRACY straightens up, having been protected by MONICA, who`s screaming, her face a lacerated pulp with glass, shards sticking out of it like a pincushion. Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet and try to flee, stampeding over each other. , TRACY, ERIC and BRAD shove their way through the crowd.
S: EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: As SUE and BAR.BA k leap from the Volvo.. SUE hears the screams from within the house, takes in the shattered windows.
C: SUE BARBARA
D: Oh, not Rachel! They race to the door as...
C: WITHIN THE HOUSE
D: BRAD runs to the front door. An IRON FIREPLACE POKER lifts up one end, then flies like a javelin towards BRAD's back as...
N: DOOR - N BARBARA and SUE approach the door when the end of the bursts from the center of it, nearly spearing a surprised BARBARA in the face as it sticks out about a foot. She jerks back, then pushes the door open with an effort. WITHIN THE HOUSE -- They enter and freeze as the door slams shut behind them, revealing a dead BRAD speared through the throat, pinned to the door. Oai, my god. Where's Rachel? They see JESSE, then RACHEL covered in tattoos. A panicked itMY smashes into BARBARA, then runs toward a window. RACHEL sees AMY and her eyes narrow... MUSIC CDs fly off a shelf and... Spin through the air at high velocity. One of the deadly frisbees buries itself in AMY's back, spinning her around. More CDs embed in her stomach, chest and throat. MARK and ERIC smash their way through the chaos as MARK's eyes flash from a collapsing AMY to RACHEL
C: MARK
D: God, it'ls her! She's doing it! SUE moves towards RACHEL.
C: SUE
D: Stop! Stop it! RACHEL has her gaze locked on... MARK, who realizes he's a dead man. He moves toward a shattered window, through which some PEOPLE escape. But RACHEL turns her head slightly and... A TELEKINETIC PULSE travels across the row of LIQUOR BOTTLES at the bar, exploding them one-by-one, spraying alcohol which douses SUE. A FLAMING LOG erupts from the fireplace... Striking the alcohol-drenched BAR, setting a blazing trail and lighting the curtains on fire, creating a wall of FLAMES before the windows.
C: SUE
D: Stop it! You don't want to-- And RACHEL snaps her head around, launching another LOG from the fireplace which strikes SUE in the back, whose alcohol drenched clothes catch flames... and she , A.
N: A screaming SUE pitches forward, rolls on the floor to put out the flames, but caly succeeds in lighting another trail of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard windows. In the eye of the storm is BARBARA, shaking her head in denial, muttering, as her mental state rapidly deteriorates.
C: BARBARA
D: No, this isn't happening. It isn't happening, isn't happening... MARK pulls ERIC by the shirt collar and they careen down...
C: A HALLWAY
D: where each of the DOORS ahead of them SLAM SHUT as they approach. Utter CHAOS, but RACHEL calmly turns into the hallway, following MARK, as if in a trance.
C: MARK
D: lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into.
C: A DEN
D: where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting trophies. MARK and ERIC are smashing a standing glass case containing pistols and rifles. TRACY leans panting against the wall. MARK slips a HANDGUN into his belt.
C: TRACY
D: Screw that, get the shotguns! Shaking, freaked out, they gather weapons.
C: THE HALL
D: d ERIC see RACHEL the end of the hall, silhouetted from behind. They take off in the other direction, TRACY bringing up the re Barrelling shoulders first into a door, the boys burst through and into...
N: EXTâ¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool. Toting their rifles, MARK, ERIC and TRACY turn to find RACHEL, at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them. TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their shoulders. TRACY slips on her glasses.
C: MARK
D: Wait till she's closer. TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger. RACHEL's eyes narrow and... TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood milky fluid. Aaaaa... She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his shredded lap, then falls over. MARK looks at his dead friend. Oh, shit. .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty feet behind him. He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him, and hauls ass. RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up. He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.
C: HIS HAND
D: grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a stranglehold.
N: His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees RACHEL standing over him. He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it. RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold, splashing into the pool. But she jolts on two...
C: GUNSHOTS
D: RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt with his pinned hand and fired. She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood. MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers. He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a mechanical whirring, and turns. A POOL COVER starts to unfold. At that moment...
C: RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM
D: bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool.
N: UNDERWATER -- As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting out the light from above. MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but the POOL COVER blocks his escape. He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as his feet kick to keep him afloat. ON THE SURFACE -- The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg, slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers slip under as the cover completely shuts. M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing.
C: BARBARA
D: Rachel! A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA. RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared little girl reaching for her mother.
E: O.S.
C: RACHEL
D: Mama. Maury? BARBARA'S P.O.V. o but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos. BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, reaching for her. Mama, please. BARBARA blinks and it's now... The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos. She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.
C: BARBARA
D: What are you? You're not my little girl. No. The devil's in you.
N: RACHEL (CRYING) Don't leave me, mama. But her mother disappears into the shadows.
C: RACHEL
D: Please, I don't have... anyone. She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT.
C: RACHEL
D: Please, God, let me die... And she tightly shuts her eyes.
T: DISSOLVE BACK TO:
C: THE LIVING ROOM
D: A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies. The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward... JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head and starts in fear as... o the center of the room, facing him. He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her gaze to...
C: THE TV SET
D: with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying
C: ON JESS
D: He looks back at her.
C: JESSE
D: Rachel, listen. I swear, d know they were taping us. d never hurt you. She looks at his pleading eyes.

And the VCR rewinds and replays.. ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you" to her while she was asleep. RACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She turns back to JESSE, amazed. A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her. JESSE (COUGHS) Rachel. Gat out, now. Go. And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him. He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over to hear. She whispers again...
C: RACHEL
D: .love you. JESSE tenderly kisses her lips. And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body Love. Her face is serene. JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's nightmare. JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter open.
C: RACHEL
D: Leave. Get out Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate. RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH...
S: EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: And a BODY is flung out the back window like a rag doll, clothes in flames. The BODY goes fifteen feet and falls onto the pool cover, its weight bowing the cover enough for water to rush over it. BACK T0: INTâ¢ THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT RACHEL on her back, looking up, eyes open, a slight smile on her lips. SHE SEES -- The BURNING CEILING collapse, raining death on her.

N: MOVING down a. dormitory hall. The room doors feature rock posters and "Fighting Irish" stickers and pennants.
S: INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
N: JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks and a notebook. An all-night study session. His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on one side of his face. Over the desk is a MIRROR and a "Fighting Irish" pennant. The only light comes from his desk lamp. He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M.
C: JESSE
D: Jesus. WALTER, Rachel's dog, hops on his lap, licks at.his face. The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him. In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING MIDNIGHT: One, two... As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise: Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in front of him: kINg of HELL Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads: Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again: kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL JESSE lowers the dog How did...

C: JESSE
D: Ssshhhh. Relax, boy. He takes a-deep breath, flips the page on the notebook, resumes his cram session. On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then scurries under the bed. JESSE is writing, in the MIRROR above h A WOMAN' s FIGURE anding in the French doors, her face hidden up, sees the WOMAN reflected, spins to watch her stop forward into the light. It's RACHEL, in hAk slip dress.

Filled only with his study notes. The dog, WALTER, is awake on the bed, blinking, having been stirred by the scream.
C: JOS
D: He recovers, runs his hands through his hair. Starts reading. The DIGITAL CLOCK reads: 11:59 A.M. In the distance, the CLOCK BELL begins'chiming midnight: One, three... JESSE reads, but in his ayes he's waiting for the savant chime. The BELL CHIMES: Four The FRENCH DOORSNinat JESSE spins. The wind. Nobody there. He turns back to his reading, his heart BEATING WILDLY again. Glances up at the mirror. Nothing. His HEARTBEATS and the BELL CHIMES get increasingly LQ= as,.. . He reads, glances up at the mirror, shivers, and it isn't in the cold.
N: Move, to ANOTHER ANGLE : Where his image is MULTIPLIED TO INFINITY in the two mirror! Fear is written on his face. And we know he'll be looking over his shoulder... Until the day he dies.
