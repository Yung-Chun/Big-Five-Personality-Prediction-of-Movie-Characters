C: WERNER
D: His mother gave birth to another baby...
E: V.O.
S: INT. NURSERY - DAY (PERIOD)
N: The serene baby. Any mother's joy. The angry baby. Fuming. PULL BACK to reveal: The two of them are in the same crib. The leg of the angry baby.

C: JULIUS
D: I know it is the cradle of democracy and the land of the free; besides, I speak twelve languages -- I'm sure I can get a job.

N: C13 OMITTED C13
S: INT. JULIUS'S HUT - DAY
N: It's a blend of modern technology and the tropical environment -- floor-to-ceiling book-cases, computers, a hammock shrouded in a mosquito net. Julius is hurriedly packing a small leather suitcase, watched by Werner. Werner hands over a photograph: it's a picture of a younger Werner, Traven, and the six fathers.
C: JULIUS
D: It's your only copy --
C: WERNER

C: A14 CONTINUED: A14 WERNER
D: And...?
C: JULIUS
D: Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me. That often happens with twins, you know.
C: WERNER
D: Julius -- please -- don't get your hopes up. Your brother doesn't even know you exist.
N: Julius gets in the boat and casts off. The boat takes off like a streak. Julius, in perfect rhythm, increases the pace. The boat is almost flying across the water.
C: JULIUS
D: Of course he does. I've always known there was something missing in my life! And deep down, I'm sure Vincent feels the same way! He's probably just like meeeee!
E: loudly as he disappears in the horizon
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM (L.A.) - DAY
N: VINCE BENEDICT lies in bed, looking extremely pleased with himself. A SEXY YOUNG WOMAN is nestled asleep against him. The digital bedside ALARM PURRS and starts to PLAY MUSIC -- something romantic that Vince hums along to.
C: VINCE
D: You sleep well, honey?
C: CARLA
D: Mmmm... like a baby.
E: SEXY YOUNG WOMAN
C: VINCE
D: Me, too. I love this new mattress. It's soft but it's hard at the same time. And I love this new clock.
N: Carla snuggles against Vince as he surveys the bedroom like a house-proud new owner. TWINS - Rev. 5/25/88 B6A. *
C: CONTINUED: VINCE
D: You've done a great job on this room, Carla.
E: A1
C: CARLA
D: You really think so? Even the curtains?

C: CARLA
D: You were great last night, Vince.
E: melting
C: VINCE
D: Naaaw... I think we're going to be very happy here. Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a man's voice drifts up the stairs:

N: TWINS - Rev. 4/15/88 6A.
C: MAN
D: Honey! I'm home!
E: O.S.
C: VINCE
D: What's he doing back so early?
E: a bit surprised but not panicked
N: Vince jumps out of bed, starts pulling on his clothes while Carla slips into a bathrobe.
C: MAN
D: Carla? You gonna cook me some breakfast or what?
E: O.S.
C: CARLA
D: Be right down, sweetheart! Vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror, straightens his Armani suit, brushes his hair, pulls it into a fashionable ponytail. He cuts a stylish figure. Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top, he covertly pockets it.
N: Carla pushes him towards the open French doors.
C: CARLA
D: Hurry up! I gotta make breakfast!
C: VINCE
D: You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.
N: TWINS - 4/14/88 7.
S: EXT. BALCONY - DAY
N: Vince steps out and jauntily climbs over the rail. It's very clear he likes the danger, being on the edge. In another life, he was probably Errol Flynn. Now, he gives Carla an Errol Flynn smile -- -- and with that, he leaps into space!
T: CUT TO:
S: 16 EXT. AL'S HOUSE - AWNING BELOW - DAY 16 *
N: As Vince gracefully lands, bounces off it onto the ground. He bends, picks up a flower, puts it in the outside pocket of his Armani suit, heads toward a new Mustang * parked not far away.
T: CUT TO:
S: 17 EXT. AL'S HOUSE - MUSTANG - DAY 17 *
N: As Vince gets in, starting to sing.
C: VINCE
D: 'Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day'... Now he does something surprising -- not starting to drive, we expect that. What we don't expect is his destination -- because what he does is simply turn the nearest corner and drive right back to the house he just snuck out of.
E: he's got a good voice
C: VINCE
D: ... 'everything's going my way'... CUT TO:
E: exiting the car, still singing

E: CONT'D as she gives him a look
N: The kitchen door opens and AL GRECO enters. He is sing- ing "Happy Birthday" and carries a wrapped gift held out in front of him. He's dressed in overalls with an insignia on his breast pocket that reads "AIRPORT
C: PARKING." VINCE
D: Stop with that horrible song, you know how I hate birthdays; they're worse than Christmas. Al presents him with the gift.
C: VINCE
D: For me?
E: coy
C: AL
D: Carla and I figured, since you were always admiring mine, what the hell...
N: TWINS - Rev. 4/27/88 9. Vince struggles to contain his delight at this irony.

N: TWINS - Rev. 4/27/88 10.
C: AL
D: You put the money on a stock? *
C: VINCE
D: A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane * Brothers.
C: CARLA
D: You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market?
E: unbelieving

S: B28 INT. AIRPORT PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY B28
N: CLOSEUP ON a large painted number 25 then PAN DOWN to reveal a new BMW. Vincent approaches the BMW and pretends to be searching for his keys while he waits for another car to pull out and drive away. The second it's gone, Vince deftly opens the BMW door with a "slim-Jim." He gets behind the wheel, hot wires the ignition and drives away. Vince is a pro.
S: C28 INT. BODY SHOP - DAY C28
N: The green BMW is already being repainted by some Men wearing goggles and using spray guns. Vince comes out of an office, counting a wad of bills, followed by the OWNER of the chop shop. TWINS - Rev. 4/15/88 12/13.
C: C28 CONTINUED: C28 VINCE

S: INT. AIRPLANE - ON STEWARDESS
N: Coming down the aisle, checking the passengers, as we hear:
C: JULIUS
D: 'Put on your red dress, baby 'Cause we're going out tonight...' A few passengers turn and look back at --
E: V.O. singing
C: JULIUS
D: seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and his head bobbing.
C: JULIUS
D: 'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.'
E: singing
N: The STEWARDESS removes his headphones and considers Julius with amusement.
C: STEWARDESS
D: I knew you were trouble the second I laid eyes on you. Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized.
C: JULIUS
D: Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it. * She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.
E: realizing
C: STEWARDESS
D: The captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because we're expecting a little turbulence.
C: JULIUS
D: Thank you, Betty Lou.
E: reading her name tag
N: TWINS - Rev. 4/27/88 15. *
C: STEWARDESS
D: I bet you're a football player.
C: JULIUS
D: Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher.
C: STEWARDESS
D: Right. And I'm a brain surgeon.
N: As the Stewardess heads back up the aisle, a MAN jumps up, grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes a gun in his other hand.
C: HIJACKER
D: Nobody moves, or else we're gonna have a serious draft in here. Get the captain. I want to discuss our final destination.
E: MAN to passengers turns to another stewardess
N: He continues maneuvering the Stewardess up the aisle. His back is totally to Julius now.
C: JULIUS
D: turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.
C: JULIUS
D: Excuse me, ma'am.
E: whispers
N: As he takes the book from her, quickly draws back his arm --
T: CUT TO:
N: HIGHJACKER The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not even to think about moving -- -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air, hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall- ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand.
T: CUT TO:
N: TWINS - Rev. 4/27/88 16. * BUNCH OF PASSENGERS grabbing him, all of them brave and heroic -- a lot of commotion -- shouts of "I've got him," "Don't move," etc.

N: OLD WOMAN as Julius smiles reassuringly, returns her Bible to her, sits back in his seat.
C: JULIUS
D: His mischief shall return upon his own hand, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head -- Psalm 7:16. In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass- engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in control. Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the music. CUT TO:
E: gently; calming her

S: INT. BAR - DAY
N: As Vince sidles into a booth, watched by a BARTENDER who clearly dislikes him.
C: BARTENDER
D: It's him. He's back.
N: A pretty young cocktail waitress called MARNIE turns and stares daggers at Vince. Marnie is a fireball of a girl, all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton candy on the inside, sort of a Jean Harlow valley girl. She approaches Vince, who greets her with effusive warmth.
C: VINCE
D: Marnie! How are you? Is your * sister around? *
N: Marnie pointedly scoops up the tip left by the previous occupants of the booth. Marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into his lap.
C: MARNIE
D: You total Linda's car. You pawn * her stereo. You declare us as * dependents on your tax return!?
C: VINCE
D: What an amazing memory --
C: FEMALE
D: Vince! I knew you'd come back!
E: O.S.
N: Marnie's sister, LINDA, also a cocktail waitress, slips into the booth and gives Vince a big kiss. Linda, although just as attractive as her younger sister, has a completely different personality: she's trusting, dependent, and legally blind when it comes to Vincent.
C: VINCE
D: I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.
E: to Linda
C: LINDA
D: Like what?
C: MARNIE
D: Linda!
N: TWINS - Rev. 5/2/88 18.
C: LINDA
D: I'm not going to give him any money. Just take care of my station for a minute.
E: to Marnie
N: Marnie exchanges an exasperated glance with the Bartender and walks away. Linda distances herself a little from Vince in the booth, not meeting his eyes.
C: VINCE
D: I didn't come here for a loan, sweetheart. I came to say goodbye. * It's not safe for me here. People are trying to kill me. Vince starts to rise but Linda pulls him back down.
E: emotionally beat
C: LINDA
D: What did you do, Vince?
C: VINCE
D: I got involved in the stock market.
C: LINDA
D: I promised Marnie I wouldn't give you money. Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her eyes.
E: getting nervous
C: LINDA
D: Don't look at me like that... Don't do that with your eyes... I shouldn't even be here with you.
C: VINCE
D: You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you... Linda. I only have eyes for you.
E: softly
C: LINDA
D: That is so beautiful. How do you make up that stuff? You're such a poet.
E: moved
N: TWINS - Rev. 5/2/88 19.
C: VINCE
D: You inspire me. CUT TO: *
S: INT. BAR - DAY
N: A man enters. He starts looking around, checking the booths. He looks like a professional enforcer, which in fact, he is. He is also the smallest of the Klane brothers: BURT KLANE. Vince ducks down under the table.
C: VINCE
D: It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out. Burt Klane strolls to the middle of the room, then suddenly turns and faces Linda.
E: whispers
C: BURT KLANE
D: Where's the little shit?
C: LINDA
D: You gotta be more specific, considering our clientele.
E: very nervous
C: BURT KLANE
D: Benedict.
C: LINDA
D: He wouldn't show his face around here. Right, Marnie? She looks down at -- VINCE
E: laughs
N: He silently starts to crawl away in the direction of the back door.
C: MARNIE
D: Who, Vincent? *
E: enjoying calling him names MORE
N: TWINS - Rev. 5/2/88 20.
C: MARNIE
D: -- That weasel, that creep -- that oily little slug -- that two-bit, two-timing, waste of space -- that pathetic, low-life pocket Romeo.

E: cutting her off
S: A37 EXT. BAR - BACK DOOR - DAY A37

S: B37 INT. BAR - DAY B37
N: Vince is thrown in, forcefully, into a table. He crashes onto the floor.
C: BOB KLANE
D: Look what I found crawling around out back.
T: CUT TO:
S: C37 INT. BAR - DAY (LATER) C37
N: A booth at the back of the restaurant: Vince is seated with the two Klane brothers. He hands over the money he picked up from the BMW -- $4000. The smaller Klane counts it quickly.
C: BURT KLANE
D: This is only four thousand --
C: VINCE
D: The rest is invested. We're gonna make a fortune.
N: Bob suddenly punches Vince in the side knocking the breath out of him.
C: BOB KLANE
D: Shut up.
E: ominous
N: TWINS - Rev. 5/2/88 21/22.
C: C37 CONTINUED: C37
D: Linda comes over -- Very nervous, she looks around, then hands over an envelope.
C: LINDA
D: I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him.
C: BURT KLANE
D: There you go -- -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow. *
E: he counts Linda's money
C: VINCE
D: Twenty -- ? But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again.
C: BURT KLANE
D: That's just the interest. The * twenty's the principal. *
S: INT. BAR - NEAR DOOR - DAY (LITTLE LATER)
N: Linda is walking Vince out.
C: VINCE
D: That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me --

S: A38 EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - MAGIC HOUR A38
N: Vince brushes himself off, hesitates a moment, pulling on his left ear with his right hand. Immediately behind him, facing the opposite direction, is another man, also pulling on his left ear with his right hand. It is Julius -- -- Their backs are to each other. Without ever catching sight of one another, they move off, going their separate ways. Now, from this --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN HOLLYWOOD STREET - NIGHT
N: Downtown Hollywood in all it's sleeze. There's a wax museum and a scientology center and every fast food place imaginable and people shouting as they sell things, "flowers" and street food and there's a porno house * showing Tight 'n Tender and there's young people dressed like punks and old people boozed out and pimps and druggies and guys slumped unconscious in the gutter and crowds of tourists walking this way, that way, and there's noise and litter and one more thing -- -- There's Julius, case in hand, staring around, taking it all in. We're a long way from his island now. He studies all the humanity swirling around him --

C: JULIUS
D: ... How wonderful...
E: almost a whisper

S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
N: Julius, eating a hot dog, is walking along a street in Hollwyood. In his island peasant garb, he doesn't look all that unusual considering his surroundings. TWINS - Rev. 5/2/88 24. But Julius is pretty noticable no matter where he goes.
T: CUT TO:
N: TWO HELMETLESS MOTORCYCLISTS watching Julius. More specifically, they are watching the expensive-looking leather-edged suitcase he carries in his hand. They look at the case a moment more, then Biker #2 gets his MACHINE PURRING softly.

D: How did you know?

C: MARNIE
D: Excuse me. She reaches past Julius to take a copy of Cosmopolitan. Julius drops the Playboy, which falls open on the ground, with the centerfold revealed. Flustered and blushing, he bends down to retrieve it, watched by Marnie, who can't take her eyes off the sheer beauty of his physique.

D: I liberated this from my file at the orphanage. Read it and weep. Julius takes the paper and reads aloud.
C: JULIUS
D: Dear Sister Anderson, your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied. According to our files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles. Vincent's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid. Vince snatches the paper back. Julius stares at him, just stunned.
C: VINCE
D: That's right, Julius, she abandoned me.

N: Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men stand up from a nearby table. They each grab one of Julius's arms.
C: BURT KLANE
D: Meet my cousins. Get these jerks outside.
E: to the Klanes
N: Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in the head. They're out cold before they realize they've been attacked. Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with each others' head. They, too, are now out cold. Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might, on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five Klanes are out cold.
C: VINCE
D: How many of those... rules do you have?

D: Where you going?

E: with a wink
N: Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to the door.

D: What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight -- We've got this great room. It just doesn't get any better than this.

E: stunned
N: Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills the overhead lights, all the while providing him with glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. She gets into one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.
C: MARNIE
D: Good night.
C: JULIUS
D: Good night. Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the other lamp. Silence...
C: MARNIE
D: This mattress is awful. Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look up, and gets into the other bed.
C: MARNIE
D: Sorry. Good night.
C: JULIUS
D: Good night.
N: Silence...

D: Anything.

They approach the fortress-like gated entrance, gazing around at the magnificent scenery. Both men carry flowers and seem self-conscious about the prospect of finally meeting their mother.

D: both with their hands up, look at one another and begin arguing.

D: I had escaped. I was on my way to Brazil -- when I felt you.

D: Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience!
C: JULIUS
D: Nobody ever said being good was easy.
N: Webster uneasily monitors their argument.
C: VINCE
D: How am I going to survive out there? What are my friends going to think?
C: JULIUS
D: You haven't got any friends.
E: smiling
C: WEBSTER
D: Just what are you two talking about?
C: VINCE

C: VINCE
D: -- Hold it, don't I get a say in this? Webster points the shotgun at Vince, starts to squeeze the trigger when --
C: JULIUS
D: pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows Webster's weapon out of his hands. Webster screams in pain, clutching his hand, dancing around.
C: VINCE
D: You can be an irritating pain -- but sometimes you come in handy. -- Where'd you get the gun?
E: amazed
C: JULIUS
D: From the dead man in the car.

D: I lied.

D: I had to. Vince beams with deep fraternal pride. Then he turns to Webster and snatches the case back.
C: VINCE
D: Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy.
N: Webster shrugs and takes out a cigarette. TWINS - Rev. 5/9/88 135. * F173 CONTINUED: (4) F173
C: WEBSTER
D: You got lucky.
N: He lights it with his lighter. Suddenly Julius smells something. Bad.
C: WEBSTER
D: But your luck just ran out. A stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that Webster punctured whilst he was shooting at Vince. It runs in a broad stream across the warehouse floor, right beneath Julius and Vince's feet. Webster is holding his cigarette out, ready to drop it in the fuel and incin- erate them.
E: smiling
C: WEBSTER
D: Drop the gun and give me back the case, or we're gonna have ourselves some barbecued Benedict. Julius drops the gun and Vince slowly hands back the case. Webster smiles and backs off down the stream of gas, still holding out the cigarette. He stops at the very edge of the building.
C: WEBSTER
D: Well, I guess this is goodbye. He raises the cigarette, ready to throw it.
C: JULIUS
D: Wait a minute. Webster looks up.
C: JULIUS
D: You've forgotten something. Webster grips the case tighter.
C: WEBSTER
D: I don't think so.
N: Julius nods.
C: JULIUS
D: The third rule in a crisis situation.
N: Julian leans calmly against the warehouse wall, supported by one arm. TWINS - Rev. 5/9/88 136. * F173 CONTINUED: (5) F173
C: WEBSTER
D: The third rule?
N: Julius's hand has pressed a button in a metal cage.
C: JULIUS
D: Duck. Suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane smashes into Webster's back, and then dumps on him, burying him in rubble.
E: smiling
C: VINCE
D: Duck? Duck? You are developing real style, Julius.
E: even more amazed can't believe it
C: JULIUS
D: drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money.
C: JULIUS
D: You came back for me.
