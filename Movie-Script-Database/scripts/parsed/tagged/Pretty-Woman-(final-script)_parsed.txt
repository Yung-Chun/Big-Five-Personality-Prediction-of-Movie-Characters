S: PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PATIO - EXTERIOR DAY
N: We are in Philip Stuckey's residence on the Hollywood Hills. Apparently, a party is in progress. Close Up on the Magician's hands and the hands of two ladies. The magician is doing tricks with coins in the ladies' hands. MAGICIAN (voice over) So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ? On lady has got three coin in her hand, and the other one only one. The magician takes the three coins from the first lady's hand, and closes it. Then he takes the only coin from the other lady's hand, but leaves it open. He puts the four coins in his hand and closes it. Credits appears in white capital letters on the screen. MAGICIAN (voice over) You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all four. Just take a look. He opens his hand, which is empty. Then he opens the first lady's hand, which contains the four coins. WOMAN (voice over) Oh ! MAGICIAN (voice over) But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this one's only worth about a penny. He takes one of the coins from the first lady's hand, hides it in his hand, and makes it appears again changed into a huge penny coin. End of the first set of credits. MAN (voice over) Hmm. MAGICIAN (voice over) And if you wonder where the other one went, watch. His left hand moves to the first lady's' ear, and gets the missing penny out of it.
C: PHILIP
D: A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ?
N: Philip Stuckey, the host, walks behind the magician. Philip is a short man in his forties, with receding hair. He looks, at the same time, obsequious and domineering. His guests laugh at his joke. Philip moves toward a young man. The camera follows Philip.

C: EDWARD
D: Look, the limo is buried back there. Darryl can't get it out.

On the side of the ambulance is written : «Los Angeles Fire Department», and below : «Paramedic».

C: THE POLICEMAN
D: Come on, guy. We just pulled her out of a Dumpster in the back. Who was her pimp ?
N: The camera follows Vivian, but we keep hearing what the two men are saying. THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over) Cocaine her pimp. She a strawberry. She be out on these streets day in, day out, trading her sorry self for some crack. Vivian stops, and looks at something we don't see on the sidewalk. She turns her head away, not feeling well because of what she has just seen. THE POLICEMAN (voice over) And what do you do ? Back to the two men.
C: THE AFRO-AMERICAN
D: I'm cool.

D: Esther Williams ! Where you belong !

D: Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch.
N: She walks away on the boulevard. Kit turns toward Vivian.
C: KIT
D: Am I really a grouch ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Yes. Sometimes.
C: KIT
D: Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat.
N: We hear someone whistling, and then : MAN (voice over) Hey, girls. Kit turns toward the boulevard, where the voice is coming from.
C: KIT
D: Hey, yo, baby !
N: Medium shot on an open convertible red car driving along the boulevard. In the car, three young men, two in the front, one in the back. The man sitting next to the driver, yells to the girls.
C: MAN IN THE CAR
D: How about a freebie ? It's my birthday.
N: The car keeps on moving on the boulevard and out of view. Back on Vivian and Kit.
C: KIT
D: Dream on !
C: VIVIAN
D: It's looking really slow tonight.
N: She takes her cap off.
C: KIT
D: Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you.
C: VIVIAN
D: And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No.
C: KIT
D: You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much.
C: VIVIAN
D: Do you think I look like Carol Channing ?
N: Kit puts her hands on Vivian's blonde wig.
C: KIT

N: Full shot on the boulevard. The Lotus is driving along the boulevard. The car bounces a little, while the gears are grinding. Back to the two girls watching the car. Vivian points to it.
C: VIVIAN
D: Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit.
N: We see the car passing in front of the girls. Apparently, it has stopped a little further on the boulevard, because we hear its brakes screeching. Reverse angle shot showing the two girls with the stopped car behind them.
C: KIT
D: No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot tonight. Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when you're through. Take care of you.
N: Vivian hugs Kit.
C: VIVIAN
D: Take care of you.

D: Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I am probably safer.
S: LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT
C: EDWARD
D: I like that. That's very good. Should have that printed on your business card.
C: VIVIAN
D: If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.

S: HOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT
N: Back on the shot through the windshield.
C: EDWARD
D: You know about cars. Where did that come from ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with, they were really into American heavy metal : Mustangs, Corvettes.
C: EDWARD
D: Ah.
S: LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT
C: VIVIAN
D: They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention. So how is it you know so little about cars ?
C: EDWARD
D: My first car was a limousine.
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh.
C: EDWARD
D: So where is this...
N: He tries to shift gears and gets another grinding noise.
C: EDWARD
D: ...heavy metal... home ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is a standard «H».
C: EDWARD
D: Standard «H». Like I know what that means.
N: She laughs.

The car starts very fast, but also very smoothly : it is now driven by very expert hands. Several shots of the car racing along the streets. Shot of the the couple through the windshield.
C: VIVIAN
D: This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size nine.
S: LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT
C: VIVIAN
D: You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist ?
N: She shows her arm to Edward, who chuckles.
C: VIVIAN

C: EDWARD
D: A hundred dollars a night ?
C: VIVIAN
D: For an hour.
C: EDWARD
D: An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking.
S: LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT
C: VIVIAN
D: I never joke about money.
C: EDWARD
D: Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff.
N: She puts her right hand on Edward's zipper.
C: VIVIAN

N: Quick medium shot on the uniformed attendant watching the scene with curiosity from the entrance of the hotel. Back to Vivian and Edward.
C: EDWARD
D: I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an hour ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Yeah.
C: EDWARD
D: Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.
C: VIVIAN

N: They start walking toward the entrance of the hotel
C: EDWARD
D: Edward.
C: VIVIAN
D: Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !
N: He smiles.
C: EDWARD
D: No ?!
C: VIVIAN
D: I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is.
C: EDWARD
D: Why don't you put this on ?
N: He puts his coat, which he was carrying on his arm, on Vivian's shoulders, and then wraps it around Vivian's body, in order to cover as much as he can of Vivian's very conspicuous outfit.
C: VIVIAN
D: Why ?
C: EDWARD
D: Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that rents rooms by the hour.
C: VIVIAN
D: Ah.
S: REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Medium shot on Edward and Vivian crossing the hotel lobby. While walking, Vivian puts her arms into the sleeves of the coat. Then she raises her eyes to look at the luxury around her.
C: VIVIAN
D: Wow !
N: EDWARD (voice over) It's all right. Medium full shot on the guests seated in comfortable armchairs near the front desk. All these guests are very elegantly dressed, and mostly middle-aged. They all look with curiosity at the strange couple that just walked in. VIVIAN (voice over) Holy shit.
C: EDWARD
D: You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting. Another medium shots on seated guests staring at the couple.
N: Edward walks to the reception desk, with Vivian following him. A very neatly dressed female receptionist is behind the counter.
C: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
D: Good evening, Mr. Lewis.
C: EDWARD
D: Hello. You have messages ?
C: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
D: Yes, we have several.
C: EDWARD
D: Thank you.
N: While Edward is looking through his messages, Vivian is leaning on the wall near the reception desk and looks around her. She takes her cap off, but one still can see her strange outfit underneath the slightly open coat. She stares at a passing female guest who stares back at her.
C: EDWARD
D: Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?
C: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
D: Of course.
N: She picks up the phone.
C: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
D: Room service for Mr. Lewis, please.
N: Edward slowly walks away from the desk, taking Vivian along with him. Medium shot on the elevator doors. Edward and Vivian reach the elevator, and Edward presses the call button. A middle-aged couple is already waiting for it. They both look at Vivian. Vivian turns around and notice their disapproving look. She raises her leg and puts the tip of her boot on the high ash-tray set near the door of the elevator, showing her thigh to the couple, and especially to the man.
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in my pantyhose.
N: She laughs and turns to the middle-aged couple.
C: VIVIAN
D: I'm not wearing pantyhose.
N: We hear the ding of the elevator bell. Vivian puts her leg down. The elevator door opens on Dennis, the young elevator attendant. Vivian is the first one to walk in.
C: VIVIAN
D: Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two.

C: EDWARD
D: First time in an elevator.
N: THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE Ah... She turns her head toward her husband. THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE Close your mouth, dear. The door of the elevator closes.
S: REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Dennis doesn't look at the couple behind him, but he still has a very broad smile. Vivian stands up from the sofa.
C: VIVIAN
D: Sorry, I couldn't help it.

D: Try.
N: The elevator moves up. Dennis tries to look casual, but doesn't really succeed.

N: Vivian gets out of the elevator.
C: EDWARD
D: To the left.
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh.
N: Edward gets out of the elevator. Dennis can't keep his eyes off Vivian, and watches her walking in the hallway. Edward turns around and looks at him a bit severely. Dennis wipes the smile off his face, goes back into the cabin of the elevator and closes the doors. The camera follows Edward walking away to the door of the penthouse, where Vivian is waiting for him. He gets his magnetic card out of his pocket. Close Up on Edward's hands trying to insert the magnetic card into the slot in the lock of the door. He sighs.
C: EDWARD
D: Oh, I miss keys.

N: Medium shot on the penthouse living room with the front door in the background. Everything - the rug on the floor, the furniture - is nice and very classy. All the lights are on. The front door opens. Edward walk in first, followed by Vivian. He switches more lights on. Vivian closes the door and starts walking around the huge living room. Edward looks at her.
C: EDWARD
D: Impressed ?
C: VIVIAN
D: You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour.
C: EDWARD
D: Sure they do. Edward has been taking a newspaper left by an attendant on a small table near the front door. He crosses the room and and drops the newspaper on the desk. He sits down behind the desk, and starts looking through his mail, while Vivian walks out on the terrace.
N: VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace) Wow, great view ! I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here.
C: EDWARD
D: I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.
N: Vivian walks in the room through another French window-door on the other side of the desk. She puts her bag on an armchair.
C: VIVIAN
D: Why don't you go out there ?
C: EDWARD
D: I'm afraid of heights.
C: VIVIAN
D: You are ?
N: Edward nods his head.
C: VIVIAN
D: So how come you rented the penthouse ?
C: EDWARD
D: It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the first floor, but I can't find one.
N: Vivian takes off Edward's coat and puts in on a sofa.
C: VIVIAN
D: Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do with me ?
C: EDWARD
D: Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.
C: VIVIAN
D: No ?
C: EDWARD
D: I hadn't exactly planned this.
C: VIVIAN
D: Well, do you plan everything ?
N: She takes her red jacket off.
C: EDWARD
D: Always.
C: VIVIAN
D: Yeah. Me too. She sits down on an armchair.
C: VIVIAN
D: I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of «fly by the seat of my pants» girl. You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's... Yeah.
N: Edward, still seated behind his desk, watches her with a strange look in his eyes. He suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasn't done something very wise in bringing Vivian with him.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe break the ice.
C: EDWARD
D: Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.
N: He takes his wallet out of this jacket.
C: VIVIAN
D: Cash works for me, yeah.
N: She stands up and walks to the desk. Edward puts the money on the desk. She takes the money and sits on the desk. She puts the money in one of her high boots.
C: EDWARD
D: You're on my fax.
C: VIVIAN
D: Well, that's one I haven't been on before.
N: She doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way. Edward takes his fax, but doesn't seem to react at Vivian's suggestive movements.
C: EDWARD
D: Cute. Very cute. Thank you.
N: She laughs, and zips one of her boots down. Out of the boot, she takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper.
C: VIVIAN
D: All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you say ? Hmm ?
C: EDWARD
D: A buffet of safety.
C: VIVIAN
D: I'm a safety girl.
N: Edward stands up from his desk. Immediately Vivian reaches for his zipper.
C: VIVIAN
D: All right, let's get one of these on you.
C: EDWARD
D: No, no. I...
N: He laughs awkwardly.
C: EDWARD
D: Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?
N: He takes his jacket off, and puts it on the back of the desk chair.
C: VIVIAN
D: Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure ?
C: EDWARD
D: Business, I think.
N: He walks away from the desk across the room.
C: VIVIAN
D: Business, you think.
N: She zips her boot back up, stands up and follows him across the room.
C: VIVIAN
D: Well... let me guess.
N: Edward, now in his shirtsleeves, but still with his necktie and his vest on, has seated himself in an armchair.
C: VIVIAN
D: That would make you... a lawyer.
N: She sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair.
C: EDWARD
D: A lawyer ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Mm-hmm.
C: EDWARD
D: What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?
C: VIVIAN
D: You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.
C: EDWARD
D: I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.
C: VIVIAN
D: I've known a lot of everybody.
N: The doorbell chimes. They both stand up.
C: VIVIAN
D: What is that ?
N: He turns around and find his face very close to Vivian's face, and seems a little disturbed by it.
C: EDWARD
D: Champagne.
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load off.
N: The doorbell chimes again. Vivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it. A room service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray. Vivian closes the door behind him.
C: ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
D: Good evening.
C: VIVIAN
D: Hi.
C: ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
D: Uh, where would you like it ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Where would we like it ?
N: Edward has seated himself back in the armchair.
C: EDWARD
D: Uh, over by the bar.
N: The attendant seems a little surprised by Vivian's outfit, but, being a good luxury hotel attendant, he pretends not to notice, and carries the tray onto the bar. After he has put the tray down, he turns around and almost bumps into Vivian, who was standing behind him.
C: VIVIAN
D: Excuse me !
N: She giggles.
C: ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
D: It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.
C: EDWARD
D: Thank you.
N: The attendant doesn't move away and remains close to Vivian, staring at her.
C: VIVIAN
D: What are you looking at ?
N: The attendant clears his throat.
C: VIVIAN
D: What is he looking at ?
N: Edward walks toward the attendant, and gives him some tip money.
C: EDWARD
D: Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.
C: ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
D: Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.
N: The attendant walks out of the room. Edward walks to the bar.
C: VIVIAN
D: A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh. Stupid.
E: in a much softer voice
C: EDWARD
D: Don't worry about it. Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar.
C: VIVIAN
D: You mind if I take my boots off ?
N: She sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it in two slightly different levels.
C: EDWARD
D: Not at all.
C: VIVIAN
D: So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?
N: She zips one of her boots down.
C: EDWARD
D: I have both.
C: VIVIAN
D: Where are they ? Shopping together ?
N: She takes her knee-length sock off. We hear the champagne bottle cork popping off.
C: EDWARD
D: My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home... with my ex-dog.
N: He brings her a glass of Champagne, which he sets down on the floor besides her. Vivian is taking her other boot off.
C: EDWARD
D: There you go.
N: He walks back to the bar to take his own glass.
C: EDWARD
D: My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of my apartment even as we speak.
N: He looks at her, a bit surprised. Vivian is draining her glass empty. Edward comes near her, with a silver bowl in his hands. In the bowl are some fresh strawberries.
C: EDWARD
D: Why don't you try a strawberry ?
N: He takes the lid off the bowl and shows it to her.
C: VIVIAN
D: Why ?
C: EDWARD
D: It brings out the flavor in the champagne.
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh, groovy. She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and brings it back on the bar. He sits down on a stool.
C: VIVIAN
D: Pretty good. Don't you drink ?
C: EDWARD
D: No.
C: VIVIAN
D: Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing, okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it along ?
C: EDWARD
D: Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue with you.
N: He stands up.
C: EDWARD
D: Why don't we just get through that right now ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Great, let's get started.
C: EDWARD
D: How much for the entire night ?
C: VIVIAN
D: Stay here ?
N: (SHE SNICKERS) You couldn't afford it.
C: EDWARD
D: Try me.
C: VIVIAN
D: Three hundred dollars.
C: EDWARD
D: Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.
N: He takes the glass off her hand. She stands up.
C: VIVIAN
D: Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.
N: She walks to the bar, where Edward is filling the glass with Champagne.
C: EDWARD
D: To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone tonight.
N: He gives her the glass, and she immediately drinks it. He sits down on the stool.
C: VIVIAN
D: Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?
C: EDWARD
D: No.
C: VIVIAN
D: I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays.
C: EDWARD
D: I bet you have.
C: VIVIAN
D: So what do you want me to do ?
N: He doesn't answer immediately, remains pensive for a couple of seconds, and then looks at her. He laughs.
C: EDWARD
D: I don't know. I really don't know.
S: PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close Up on the sink, and Vivian's hands been washed. She turns the faucet off and takes an white towel to dry her hands. The camera tilts up to Vivian's face, who walks to the door.
C: VIVIAN
D: I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to me.

N: Close Up shot on the TV screen, where an old black and white episode of «I love Lucy» is being played. It is episode 23 from Season 5, called «Lucy's Italian Movie». Lucy is standing close to a huge bucket full of grapes, and seems a bit reluctant to climb into it. Behind her, a fat Italian lady is speaking Italian to her. We hear recorded laughs coming from the TV set. The camera moves away from the TV set. We hear Edward's voice speaking on the telephone. EDWARD (voice over) Yes, that may be true, Vance. We hear Vivian laughing. EDWARD (voice over) Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse Industries. On the TV screen, the Italian fat lady is climbing into the bucket full of grapes. The camera keeps on moving away from the TV set, and we discover Vivian sitting on the floor and drinking Champagne. And, behind her, we see Edward sitting on an armchair near a small table on which the telephone set is resting. Edward is writing on a document resting on his laps.

D: Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank you very much.

On the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes stomping. Still resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it. On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the grapes, but the sound shuts off. Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig. Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are now dancing on the grapes. Back to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off. She opens his shirt on his chest, and bends on it. Close Up on their two faces, very close to each other.

D: Well, Miss Vivian. Things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Now, Mr. Lewis, however, is a very special customer, and we like to think of our special customers as friends.

N: Vivian takes the loose jumbled banknotes from her bag and shows them to Barney.
C: VIVIAN
D: Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody will help me.

But Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking around for her. As Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian. Medium shot on Edward. There is a look of surprise in Edward's eyes when he recognizes Vivian. Back to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark- colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly styled. Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds. She stands up from the bar and walks toward him.
C: VIVIAN
D: You're late.
C: EDWARD
D: You're stunning.
N: She laughs.
C: VIVIAN
D: You're forgiven.
C: EDWARD
D: Shall we go to dinner ?
N: He gives her his arm. She puts her arm inside his arm and they walk across the lounge toward the exit.
S: RESTAURANT «LE VOLTAIRE» - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: High angle shot of the whole restaurant. It looks like a very expensive place. Tables are scattered around the room and on the gallery, but not too close to one another. In the middle of the room, a larger table used only by the waiters. We see Edward and Vivian crossing the room, with a maitre d'hotel walking in front of them.
C: MAITRE D'HOTEL
D: This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.
C: EDWARD
D: Stop fidgeting. Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated.

C: JAMES MORSE
D: Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.
N: They shake hands.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: This fireball is my grandson, David.
C: DAVID MORSE
D: Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is true enough.
C: EDWARD
D: I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.
C: VIVIAN
D: Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.
C: EDWARD
D: Mr. Morse. David.
N: She shakes hands with both men.
C: EDWARD
D: Please, sit.
N: The maitre d'hotel pulls the chair for Vivian. The men wait for Vivian to be seated to sit down. Vivian has James Morse on her right, Edward on her left, and David in front of her.
C: VIVIAN
D: Excuse me.
E: SOFTLY
N: She stands up. Immediately, the maitre d'hotel pulls her chair, and the three men stand up, to Vivian's surprise.
C: EDWARD
D: Where are you going ?
N: She smiles to the two other men.
C: VIVIAN
D: I'm going to the ladies' room.
N: The two Morse men smile back to her.
C: EDWARD
D: Upstairs, to the right.
C: VIVIAN
D: Okay. Excuse me.
N: She starts walking away.
C: EDWARD
D: Shall I order for you ?
N: She turns around.
C: VIVIAN
D: Yeah.
N: She stops, exhales, and says, in a more polite tone :
C: VIVIAN
D: Please do so. Thank you.
C: EDWARD
D: I'll do that.
N: She walks away. The three men sit down. Close Up shot on a plate being laid in front of one of the guests. On the plate, four appetizers, actually four canapés. DAVID MORSE (voice over) Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a company... The camera moves up from the plate to the guest's face. The guest is Vivian, and she looks a bit worried by what has been brought to her. DAVID MORSE (voice over) ...should control its destiny. Vivian turns to Edward.
C: VIVIAN
D: Where's the salad ?
N: David looks at Vivian, a bit surprised by what she just said. Edward whispers to Vivian
C: EDWARD
D: Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.
C: VIVIAN
D: That's the fork I knew.
N: David smiles. Vivian takes one of her forks and looks at it, then she puts it back. DAVID MORSE (voice over) Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions are. Sensing Vivian's embarrassment, James Morse smiles to her.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure which goes with what !
N: He points to the different forks around his plate. Vivian laughs. David seems a bit annoyed by the fact that the conversation keeps on deviating on menial subjects. James Morse takes one of the canapés with his fingers and eats it. Vivian smiles, and also takes the canapé with her fingers. She wipes something out of it before eating it. Edward smiles. He is happy that Vivian and James are getting along so well. Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. We see the waiter's hand putting down a plate of snails in their shells. DAVID MORSE (voice over) You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of cities. Men like my grandfather made this country. Vivian looks at the snails and then at the waiter.
C: VIVIAN
D: Who ordered this ?
N: David seems more and more annoyed by the situation with Vivian. THE WAITER (voice over) The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appétit. Edward looks at Vivian.
C: EDWARD
D: These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a delicacy. Try it. David ?
N: David bends down on the table. His grandfather looks at him.
C: DAVID MORSE
D: Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the company ?
N: Vivian is trying to figure out how to work the snail pincers. Edward looks at David
C: EDWARD
D: Break it up and sell off the pieces.
N: Edward is trying to mime to Vivian how to use the snail pincers. Closer shot on James Morse.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea... of your turning forty years of my work into your garage sale.
N: Vivian is still fighting with her snail pincers. Close Up on Vivian's plate and her hands trying to use the snail pincers. EDWARD (voice over) At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are going to be a very rich man. James Morse looks at Edward.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.
N: Eventually, Vivian had succeeded in fitting one snail into the snail pincers, but it flies away from the pincers. The waiter, a white-hair man with a gentle face, catches it. Edward looks at the waiter and then at Vivian. VIVIAN SMILES
C: VIVIAN
D: Slippery little suckers.
N: Both Morse gentlemen smile. THE WAITER (smiling) It happens all the time. Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. A ball of green ice cream, in a silver cup, is being put down on the table. Medium shot on the Morse gentlemen.

C: JAMES MORSE
D: He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.
C: EDWARD
D: No, I have the franchise on that.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: Does that make him proud ?
C: EDWARD
D: I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.
C: VIVIAN
D: I'm sorry too.
C: EDWARD
D: Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you ?
C: JAMES MORSE
D: Leave my company alone.
C: EDWARD
D: I can't do that. I own ten million shares.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: I'll buy your stock back.
C: EDWARD
D: You don't have the money.
C: DAVID MORSE
D: We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.
C: EDWARD
D: There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there.
C: DAVID MORSE
D: And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ?
N: JAMES MORSE (voice over) Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David. Quick shots at Edward with a slight ironical smile on his face, and then at Vivian, looking embarrassed.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: Mr. Lewis plays hardball.
C: EDWARD
D: Yes, yes, I do.
N: David slams his napkin on the table
C: DAVID MORSE
D: I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure to meet you. I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis. He stands up and walks away.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.
N: He stands up.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.
N: Edward stands up. James Morse comes close to him.
C: JAMES MORSE
D: Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart.
C: EDWARD
D: I look forward to it, sir.
N: He walks away. Vivian looks more and more embarrassed.
C: EDWARD
D: Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ?
N: He sits down.
C: VIVIAN
D: He seems like a nice man.
C: EDWARD
D: I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does it ?
C: VIVIAN
D: I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his grandson.
N: Two waiters puts down plates in front of Edward and Vivian.
C: EDWARD
D: Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he does, but he does.
N: He makes a sign to the waiters who were wondering about the missing guests.
C: EDWARD
D: No, just the two.
N: THE WAITER (voice over) Yes, sir. From her purse, Vivian takes out a little ketchup sealed pack, as found in fast food restaurants, and starts tearing it open. Edwards looks at her and smiles. Close Up on Vivian's plate, where there are a piece of meat, a cob of corn, a jacket potato sliced in two halves, and some salad. We see Vivian's hand pouring ketchup from the pack on her meat. Medium shot on the maitre d'hotel walking toward the waiter and whispering in his ear. The waiter nods his head toward Vivian. Close Up on Vivian's plate. She spread the ketchup on her meat with her fork. The maitre d'hotel walks away, bobbing his head in a deprecating manner. Vivian looks around and senses that something is wrong.

D: It's ketchup.
N: The waiter smiles.
C: THE WAITER
D: Yes, sir.
N: EDWARD (voice over) Check, please.
C: THE WAITER

N: He looks down at the feet of his chair.

S: PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

N: She starts leaning back a little.

S: PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
C: EDWARD
D: I will not let myself become emotionally involved in business.
C: VIVIAN
D: I know. Kit's always saying to me, «Don't get emotional when you turn tricks». That's why no kissing. It's too personal.
N: Edward is smiling.
C: VIVIAN
D: It's like what you're saying : You stay numb, you don't get involved. When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do it.
N: Edward looks at her with an ironical smile on his face. Vivian sighs and smiles.
C: VIVIAN
D: I mean... except with you.
C: EDWARD
D: Oh, of course, not with me. You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money.
N: Vivian looks embarrassed.

N: He stands up.
C: EDWARD
D: Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli tomorrow. He strokes her chin very delicately. She stands up.
C: VIVIAN
D: Where are you going ?
C: EDWARD
D: I'm going downstairs for a while.
S: PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Later in the night. Close Up on the TV screen. We see the closing scene of the film «Charade», directed in 1963 by musical comedy actor Stanley Donen. Regina (played by Audrey Hepburn) is talking with Peter (played by Cary Grant). REGINA (voice over from the TV) Did you say marriage license ? PETER (voice over from the TV) Now, don't change the subject, just give me the stamp. Regina throws her arms around Peter's neck REGINA (voice over from the TV) Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your name is. The picture from the film, who was filling the whole TV screen, suddenly becomes a smaller one in the center of the TV screen. Four other pictures, from four other films, appears in each corner of the TV screen. REGINA (voice over from the TV) Oh, I love you. The camera moves back and we see the back of the sofa.

N: Full shot of the room, which is very dark. In the background, we see a stage with music stands on it. In front of the stage, Edward, in shirtsleeves, is playing on a concert piano.

N: Edward grabs her, lifts her, and sits her on the piano. We hear the piano keys being pounded by Vivian's feet. Edward strokes her hair. He wants to kiss her, but she moves away. Eventually, she puts her head into his neck, and kisses him on the neck. The bathrobe has fallen down on the piano. Edward spreads Vivian's legs apart, and squeezes himself between those open legs. Vivian lies down on the piano, while Edward is having sex with her. The camera slowly moves away from the piano, giving us a full shot of the entire room. We hear the piano key being pounded, and the camera goes down behind some unspecified piece of furniture, making a fade-out to black screen.

Vivian is still wearing her blue very short skirt, but the upper half of her body is covered by a white shirt, knotted at the waist and with the sleeves rolled back on her arms. She is also wearing regular woman's shoes, so she doesn't look like a prostitute any more.
C: VIVIAN
D: People are looking at me.
N: They now walk on the sidewalk.
C: EDWARD
D: They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.
C: VIVIAN
D: The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.

C: HOLLISTER
D: Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that. That's why when you came in... Edward takes Hollister's elbow and walks slightly away.
C: EDWARD
D: Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?
C: HOLLISTER
D: ...we knew from the first...
C: EDWARD
D: We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You understand that.
N: Vivian smiles behind Edward.

C: THE SALESWOMAN
D: Oh, this is absolutely divine.
N: Another saleswoman, also with a dress in her hand, is coming from the other side. Medium shot on Edward behind the counter. In the background, we hear female voices, but we don't understand the words. Hollister walks toward Edward.
C: HOLLISTER
D: Excuse me, sir, uh,
C: EDWARD
D: Yeah ?
C: HOLLISTER
D: Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about ? Just profane or really offensive ?
C: EDWARD
D: Really offensive.
C: HOLLISTER
D: I like him so much !
N: Edward takes the phone to his ear, and Hollister walks away. We hear the orchestral music from the title song : «Pretty Woman» Vivian is still seated on her armchair, looking at all the clothes that the saleswomen are bringing to her. She has a very bright red dress in her hand and she looks at Edward. Edward makes a face and nods «No». A saleswoman put a black hat on Vivian's head. Edward smiles and nods «Yes».

I was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation. I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would take it.
