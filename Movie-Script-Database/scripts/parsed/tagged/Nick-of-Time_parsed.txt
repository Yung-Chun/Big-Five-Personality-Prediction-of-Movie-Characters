S: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM
N: Union Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still grand. A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00. Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter. THE TIME - We see the big hand slam into "7". A loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from San Diego, Del Mar...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM
N: The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow, grinding stop.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and Irvine is now arriving at Gate Nine.
E: V.O.
N: Doors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Amtrack 264 will be departing in fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for Oxnard, Ventura...
E: V.O.
S: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM
N: A MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors. He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his beefy counterpart.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc...
E: V.O.
N: THE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo...
E: V.O.
N: Then he looks up to the big clock. The minute hand slams into the "8".
C: ANNOUNCER
D: ...and points north.
N: He resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Look sharp.
N: They stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the crowd.
C: MS. JONES
D: That one.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Nah. Hates his wife.
N: They're talking about a couple in their forties. She motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband follows with the suitcases. WHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by.
C: MS. JONES
D: I hate rollerblades.
S: EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM
N: The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within the train:
C: GENE
D: Lynn! Lynn!!
N: GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. He takes a relieved breath when he sees her.
C: GENE
D: Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?
N: As he comes down the steps:
C: GENE
D: I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
C: LYNN
D: Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
C: GENE
D: We made it.
N: LYNN nods back.
C: LYNN
D: We made it.
S: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:08PM
N: WHOOSH! A SECURITY GUARD approaches the two ROLLERBLADING TEENS. They circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away, laughing. MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as they come through the gate.
C: MS. JONES
D: Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Keep your eyes peeled.
C: MS. JONES
D: What about them?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Too old.
N: They're talking about a COUPLE IN THEIR SIXTIES, warmly greeting each other.
C: MR. JONES
D: Him!
C: MR. SMITH
D: If you ever had an idea it would die of malnutrition. First those blue hairs then some Spic. Leave this to me. I know people. It's my job. I'm a people person.
N: MR. SMITH laughs at his joke.
C: MS. JONES
D: What the fuck are you looking for?
N: MR. SMITH has spotted someone.
C: MR. SMITH
D: I'm looking for them.
C: MS. JONES
D: Where?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Right there.
N: He starts walking towards the exit gate.
S: INT. UNION STATION -ARRIVAL CONCOURSE - DAY - 12:09PM
N: GENE has emerged with LYNN. They pause there, getting their bearings. Next to them, a YOUNG COUPLE is kissing. They can't keep their hands off each other.
C: GENE
D: I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do you see a phone?
N: LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them, covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE laughs.
C: GENE
D: Come on, you.
N: They start walking across the concourse, towards MR. SMITH and MS. JONES.
C: GENE
D: Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
E: to LYNN
C: LYNN
D: On TV.
C: GENE
D: You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
N: LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level. MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move around them, and keep going.
C: GENE
D: Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You can talk about her all you want. You know that, don't you?
E: to LYNN
N: LYNN nods.
C: GENE
D: So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
C: LYNN
D: No way.
C: GENE
D: How did you see us kiss?
N: LYNN gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss.
C: GENE
D: That's it? That little peck of a kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some kisses.
N: LYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at the big clock.
C: GENE
D: Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.
S: INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PM
N: MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target: the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE. WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them. MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on the couple.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
C: MS. JONES
D: Young love.
N: The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR. SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Foreigners! Fuck!
E: sotto voce
C: MS. JONES
D: Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
N: MR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with.
S: INT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PM
N: GENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has wandered a few yards away.
C: GENE
D: Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but... Hey, hey!
N: He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN, one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.
C: GENE
D: Watch that! Lynn, come here!
N: She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES. MR. SMITH has noticed GENE. GENE at the phone.
C: GENE
D: Sorry. There's some crazy kids on skates. Listen, the train just got in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few minutes late.
N: The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand- filled ashtray next to him.
C: GENE
D: Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as I can. Bye, now.
N: He hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS.
C: GENE
D: Ready?
E: to LYNN
C: LYNN
D: Nods.
C: GENE
D: Let' s do it.
N: He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing nasty things to knees and wrists.
C: GENE
D: Whoops.
N: He stands over them with LYNN.
C: GENE
D: Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
C: LYNN
D: Right.
N: ANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PM
C: MR. SMITH
D: Perfect.
N: He starts forward.
C: MS. JONES
D: Perfect.
E: not so sure
N: She follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Could I see some identification, sir?
C: GENE
D: What?
C: MS. JONES
D: I.D. Could we see some?
E: ditto with the badge
C: GENE
D: Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? Will a driver's license do?
C: MR. SMITH
D: That'll do just fine.
N: GENE pulls out his wallet, surprised and confused. MR. SMITH looks at it.
C: GENE
D: Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
C: MR. SMITH
D: You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
C: GENE
D: Yes.
C: MS. JONES
D: Where's that?
C: GENE
D: Near Lompoc, north. What's...
C: MR. SMITH
D: Come with us, sir.
C: GENE
D: I'd like to know what...
C: MR."SMITH
D: Don't cause a ruckus, sir.
N: He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not- so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
C: MS. JONES
D: Come with me, honey.
N: MS. JONES swoops LYNN up and heads for the station entrance.
C: GENE
D: Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
C: MR. SMITH
D: Don't worry. She's good with kids.
N: GENE hurries after MS. JONES. MR. SMITH grabs up the suitcases.
S: INT. UNION STATION - SOUVENIR SHOP - DAY - 12:11PM
N: MS. JONES nears a souvenir stand. The OWNER is looking the other way. Without breaking stride, MS. JONES reaches out, snatches a child's coloring book and crayons.
C: LYNN
D: You stole that.
C: MS. JONES
D: No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
N: And they're out the door, GENE hurrying after. The big hand on the big clock moves.
S: EXT. UNION STATION PARKING LOT - DAY - 12:12PM
N: MS. JONES heads for-a van with smoked windows. She gets inside with LYNN. GENE stops a few feet away.
C: GENE
D: What is going on?
N: MR. SMITH prods him in the ribs.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.
N: GENE looks desperately around for help. There is none. He lets MR. SMITH push him toward the van.
S: INT. VAN -.DAY - 12:13PM
N: LYNN and MS. JONES are in the back.
C: MS. JONES
D: Let's get your seatbelt on. Always gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that right?
N: LYNN resists.
C: LYNN
D: I want my daddy.
N: GENE climbs into the front passenger seat.
C: MS. JONES
D: There's your daddy. See? We're your daddy's friends.
N: MR. SMITH climbs into the driver's seat.
C: MR. SMITH
D: That's right. The policeman is your friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?
N: GENE looks down. MR.. SMITH has pulled his gun. He points it casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general direction of the little girl.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Daddy?
C: GENE
D: Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
C: MS. JONES
D: Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
C: LYNN
D: Everybody does?
C: MS. JONES
D: Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
N: She puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in end.
C: MS. JONES
D: This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
C: LYNN
D: Laughs.
C: MS. JONES
D: It goes in that little hole.
C: LYNN
D: Let me do it.
N: She plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN gets a big smile on her face.
C: LYNN
D: It's loud!
E: loudly
N: She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, etc., oblivious to all else.
C: MS JONES
D: Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the seat. She begins to type in several characters.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Let's get down to business.
C: GENE
D: Who are you? You're not the police.
C: MS. JONES
D: Brilliant.
N: MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag. He looks back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun. It hurts.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
C: GENE
D: You wouldn't...
C: MS. JONES
D: Try us.
N: He looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair.
C: GENE
D: Get your hands off her.
N: He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Mr. Watson, you're not paying attention. Your daughter's life depends on you. Do you understand that?
N: GENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having a hard time focussing. She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR. SMITH Do you understand?
C: GENE
D: Yes, yes, I understand.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Good.
N: He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in GENE'S lap.
C: MR. SMITH
D: This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
C: GENE
D: Yes, I'm listening.
C: MR. SMITH
D: She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
N: He gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises.
C: MR. SMITH
D: When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take this.
N: MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.
C: MR. SMITH
D: ...and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that?
N: It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain.
C: GENE
D: You're out of your mind.
C: MR. SMITH
D: What's your point?
C: GENE
D: I will do no such thing.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
N: A "snap!" from the back seat. GENE looks. MS. JONES has broken a carrot stick. She breaks another.
C: MS. JONES
D: Don't worry. We'll take good care of the kid.
N: She gives half the carrot stick to LYNN, pops the other half in her mouth and grinds it to pulp. MR. SMITH is checking his watch.
C: MR. SMITH
D: It is now 12:16. If the woman in the picture is alive at 1:30... ...I call my partner, your daughter is dead.
E: holds up a walkie- talkie
N: He looks in the rear-view mirror to MS. JONES.
C: MR. SMITH
D: And what happens if I don't call you?
C: MS. JONES
D: I kill her anyway.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do you understand?
N: He taps the manila envelope.
C: MR. SMITH
D: The woman in the picture...
N: He indicates the back seat with his head.
C: MR. SMITH
D: ...or your daughter.
N: GENE looks at his daughter.
C: GENE
D: Oh, my God...
N: MR. SMITH reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope into GENE'S pockets.
C: MR. SMITH
D: God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
C: MS. JONES
D: Only you.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You're wasting time.
N: He reaches across GENE, opens the door and pushes him out, then follows him. LYNN takes off the ear-phones, tries to undo her seatbelt.
C: LYNN
D: Where is my daddy going?
N: MS. JONES wraps a big arm around her.
C: MS. JONES
D: He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
C: LYNN
D: My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
C: MS. JONES
D: Just like Power Rangers.
S: EXT. UNION STATION PARKING'LOT - DAY - 12:18PM
N: MR. SMITH activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Let's test this thing. You on?
N: He holds it up for GENE to hear.
C: MS. JONES
D: Reading you.
E: O.S. filtered
N: MR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You'11 need some cash. I'll hang onto this for the time being. Oh, and...
E: re: the wallet
N: He grabs one of GENE's hands.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You'll need these.
N: He dumps six bullet's into GENE's palm from a cloth Chivas Regal bag.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a wastin'.
N: GENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him a shove away from the van and into the midst of...
S: EXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - BUS STOP - DAY - 12:19PM
N: ...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried along like a leaf in a stream. Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets, turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see... The van is gone! ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step. A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: Mama!
N: She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder. Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station. It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more confident. Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in behind him speaking in his ear.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead. Do it.
E: into walkie-talkie
C: MS. JONES
D: Go ahead, sugar Die.
E: O.S. filtered
C: LYNN
D: Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling Daddy. Come in, Daddy.
E: V.O. filtered
N: GENE grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man.
C: GENE
D: Lynn!
C: LYNN
D: I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
E: V.O. filtered
C: GENE
D: Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
C: MR. SMITH
D: That's enough.
C: MS. JONES
D: 'Daddy has to go now.
E: V.O. filtered
C: LYNN
D: He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
E: filtered
C: GENE
D: Over and out.
N: MR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
C: GENE
D: At one thirty my little girl is dead.
E: softly
C: MR. SMITH
D: Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
N: He pushes GENE on, toward a cab.
C: MR. SMITH
D: And don't forget I'll be watching you.
N: GENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the stand.
S: EXT. UNION STATION - CAB STAND - DAY - 12:21PM
N: The CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab.
C: CABBIE
D: Where to, sir?
C: GENE
D: The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
N: The CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into the cab.
S: INT. CAB - DAY - 12:21PM
N: The CABBIE gets in and they take off. GENE stares at the manila envelope in his hand. He starts to open it, is stopped by:
C: CABBIE
D: Amtrack?
C: GENE
D: What?
C: CABBIE
D: You just come in on Amtrack?
C: GENE
D: Uh, yes..
C: CABBIE
D: Business or pleasure?
C: GENE
D: Business.
C: CABBIE
D: Where'd you come from?
C: GENE
D: San Diego.
C: CABBIE
D: Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego. It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops. Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
C: GENE
D: Sorry.
C: CABBIE
D: 'S okay. What do you think?
C: GENE
D: Huh?
C: CABBIE
D: Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
C: GENE
D: I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
C: CABBIE
D: Aw, too bad.
N: They lapse into silence. GENE starts to open the envelope again.
C: CABBIE
D: Somebody close?
C: GENE
D: What?
C: CABBIE
D: The grave. Somebody close?
C: GENE
D: Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were separated. She was thinking about a divorce.
N: GENE notices the dashboard clock - GENE leans forward.
C: GENE
D: Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
C: CABBIE
D: Oh, yeah?
N: He hits the horn and swerves to the left.
C: CABBIE
D: Jesus! Watch it, buddy!
S: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY - 12:22PM
N: GENE looks out his window and finds himself staring at MR. SMITH, staring back at him, driving the van, next to him. He throws himself back in the seat.
S: INT. CAB - DAY - 12:22PM
N: The cab pulls into the drive front of the Bonaventure Hotel and stops.
C: CABBIE
D: I'd love to hear about your problem, but the ride's over. Three-fifty.
N: GENE looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to the curb on the other side of the street.
C: CABBIE
D: Three-fifty. I hope your problem doesn't have anything to do with my three-fifty.
N: GENE looks back at the CABBIE, waiting for his fare.
C: GENE
D: Right. Right.
N: GENE digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his business cards. He hurriedly writes on it: "HELP. VAN KIDNAP CHILD." He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the CABBIE'S hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.
S: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM
N: GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.
S: INT. CAB - DAY - 12:23PM
N: The CABBIE finds the secreted card, but looks at the wrong side.
C: CABBIE
D: What do I want with an accountant?
N: A DOORMAN leans down at the window.
C: DOORMAN
D: I got one for the airport. You free?
C: CABBIE
D: You bet.
N: The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away, the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it up.
S: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM
N: GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what it is. He looks around. VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and going. No one pays particular attention to him. GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away. GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately hanging onto the last glimpse of it. MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE goes into the hotel.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM
N: GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air- conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants, waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance. HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by someone high above. CLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM GENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he starts tracking all around him, seeing...something.
C: GENE
D: Oh, my God. Oh, no.
N: He desperately fumbles in his pocket. Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a huge, rolled up banner. GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of it in your best red, white, and blue: "RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR" And an addendum: "HERE TODAY!"
C: GENE
D: Oh, shit.
N: It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere. On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several years her junior. These have the caption, "Governor Grant and husband Brendan".
C: GENE
D: Oh, sweet Jesus...
N: His eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance, walkie-talkie in hand, watching him. GENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and gives GENE a move of the head - "Get to it." GENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate him, then slides out the itinerary. The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00 noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant". GENE checks his watch. He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy, GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays.
C: GENE
D: Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
N: GUSTINO points up.
C: GUSTINO
D: Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the signs.
N: GENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns back.
C: GENE
D: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
N: GUSTINO smiles.
C: GUSTINO
D: No problem.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:26PM
N: GENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs.
S: INT. "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:2 6PM
N: The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene ascends. GENE forces himself not to look at MR. SMITH behind him. His nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination.
S: INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM
N: GENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room. He walks that way. MR. SMITH follows.
S: INT. THIRD FLOOR - SHOP ARCADE AREA - DAY - 12:27PM
N: GENE and MR. SMITH pass gift shops, snack bars. The walkway is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS, POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME TAGS. GENE plows on through... ...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Whoops!
E: laughs
N: The two men reel back from each other. A SECURITY MAN, earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them. BRENDAN GRANT is a charmingly smooth man.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Nice body check.
N: He continues on, talking to an ATTRACTIVE WCMAN COMPANION. BRENDAN GRANT What the Governor really admires, Mrs. Wentzel, and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion, are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it into a positive force. He slides a familiar hand around her waist.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: You know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. They are felons and they should be treated as such. A drivers license is a privilege, not a right.
N: And he is hustled away. Right past an election poster featuring him and Governor Grant. Still stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches the Governor's husband, but keeps walking.
S: INT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM
N: It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. GENE comes in. A WOMAN is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's just copped.
C: GENE
D: Excuse me, is the...thing over?
C: WOMAN
D: Yes. You didn't miss much. The food...chicken again.
C: GENE
D: Eleanor Grant is gone?
C: WOMAN
D: Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same at all these...
N: But GENE has turned away. The WOMAN gives him a face, grabs another centerpiece and exits. A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing through a combination of relief and agony. MR. SMITH is suddenly next to him.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Check your itinerary. Move along.
N: GENE gets out the itinerary. "12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/ Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant - INVITATION ONLY - Bona Vista Lounge".
C: GENE
D: This says "invitation only".
C: MR. SMITH
D: Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
N: MR SMITH digs into the manila envelope, comes out with a handful of security badges, name tags, invites. He plucks the name tag that MS JONES printed earlier. It has a red ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign. He fastens it to Gene's lapel.
C: MR. SMITH
D: This'11 get you in anywhere. Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
C: GENE
D: Where did you get these? Who are you?
C: MR. SMITH
D: I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
S: INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE "RED" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM
N: GENE approaches. He notices a flurry of movement, a small GROUP OF PEOPLE moving determinedly through the lobby. It is GOVERNOR ELEANOR GRANT with a small entourage! She is a handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the elevator. KRISTA pushes the button.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: They-didn't hear a word I said. The mike was too low on the podium.
C: KRISTA
D: How much did we pay for that room?
C: CHIEF AIDE
D: We didn't.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Somebody did.
N: KRISTA turns to an Aide.
C: KRIST
D: A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.
N: The elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to close. Gene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go? GENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard.
C: BODYGUARD
D: Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor. You can take the next one.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest supporters.
N: She smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- it? I love saying that.
N: GENE steps aboard, shakes her hand.
S: INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM
N: The elevator begins to rise.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch? I'm about to bust as it is.
C: KRISTA
D: We'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con.
N: INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR We are on the third floor. The doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise.
C: GENE
D: Governor...
N: It comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned, his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed.
C: GENE
D: I need your help.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
C: GENE
D: Its'...ah...about my daughter....
N: The elevator slows and stops on the next floor above. INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR We are on the fourth floor. Behind GENE, the doors open.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Room for one more?
E: O.S.
N: GENE freezes.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I think we can accommodate you.
N: She offers her hand to MR. SMITH as he steps on board.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent.
C: MR. SMITH
D: A pleasure to meet you, Governor.
N: The car begins to rise again. ELEANOR .GRANT turns back to GENE.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: You were saying? Your daughter....?
C: GENE
D: I...
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Yes?
N: ANGLE ON MR SMITH Yes??? ANGLE ON GENE What to do now?
C: GENE
D: She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Of course. I wish everything were that easy.
C: KRISTA
D: I've got the pen if you've got the paper.
N: GENE looks at her. She smiles back.
C: KRISTA
D: How about that?
N: He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, the one MR. SMITH gave him.
C: KRISTA
D: Is that something precious?
C: GENE
D: No, that's,..that's fine
N: He gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen. GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the envelope.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: What's her name?
N: GENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR. SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt - do it! GENE pulls his eyes away.
C: GENE
D: Her name? Her name is Lynn.
N: ELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket. Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA talking to him.
C: KRISTA
D: It's funny. I don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic.
N: He gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the sweat from his face.
C: KRISTA
D: If it wasn't for double A batteries I'd be in big trouble.
N: He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where his gun is. He looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security. There is the hint of a gun on his hip. GENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is the SECURITY MAN staring at him? ELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Are you all right? Elevators make me queasy, too.
N: GENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to stop the shakes. The doors open, startling him.
S: INT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:2 9PM
N: ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage exit to greetings and applause. GENE stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with MR. SMITH. The doors close and the elevator descends.
S: INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM
N: MR. SMITH is fuming, his face red. He explodes.
C: MR. SMITH
D: She was right in front of you! What's wrong with you!?
N: His fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs GENE into a corner, physically terrified.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Are you 'fucking with me!?
C: GENE
D: The gun...
C: MR. SMITH
D: What about the gun?
C: GENE
D: It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You...
N: He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE, controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket, expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You won't get many chances like that, Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. Don't blow the next one.
N: He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes. GENE looks out and down. GENE'S POV The van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the Bonaventure, on Flower Street.
S: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:29PM
N: LYNN is coloring a picture in her stolen book. MS. JONES takes a look.
C: MS. JONES
D: That's pretty good.
C: LYNN
D: I've done much better ones than this.
C: MS. JONES
D: You have, huh?
C: LYNN
D: Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
C: MS. JONES
D: That's good. That's good, sweetie pie.
E: checks her watch
S: INT. RED ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:29PM
N: The elevator continues its descent and the van disappears from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible. MR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket.
C: MR. SMITH
D: There, all loaded. Ready for the hunt.
N: The elevator, doors open into the lobby.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - YELLOW ELEVATOR LOBBY -
N: DAY - 12:29PM MR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping his wife with a video camera. VIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM We see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith. He turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a read-out of the TIME: 12:31:00.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM
N: Back in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside the Men's Room. "Huey's Polished Act" and below that, hand- lettered, "Disabled Veteran" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish black man, reads a "Smithsonian" magazine. He sees GENE and perks up - a customer.
C: HUEY
D: Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they...?
N: But GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room.
C: HUEY
D: You don't see your face, you don't pay!
E: calling after him
N: HUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine.
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM
N: Gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes. He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in, grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire. Gene spins around. It is MR. SMITH, of course. MR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY
N: GENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:32PM
N: HUEY sets down his magazine again.
C: HUEY
D: Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
N: It's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times. GENE looks around. MR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view.
C: HUEY
D: Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective.
N: GENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair. The gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary. ECU - ITINERARY 12:45 - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Rim Multi-Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor GENE looks at his watch. ECU WATCH The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches. ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM He works away at GENE's shoes.
C: HUEY
D: So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in The City of Angels?
N: It's more of HUEY's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.
C: GENE
D: I'm...I'm visiting.
N: GENE watches MR. SMITH frown and amble toward the shoeshine stand.
C: HUEY
D: What do you do, if I may be so bold?
C: GENE
D: I'm just an accountant.
E: looking at MR. SMITH
C: HUEY
D: Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants? They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
N: ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:33PM He takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his chair. ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM
C: HUEY
D: Now you take tips. Time was a tip was between a man and his customer. Not any more. They've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies. They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning "in the middle", but if you ask me it means "just plain mean". Why you can have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure. Doesn't seem quite right., does it?
C: GENE
D: No. No, it doesn't.
N: The Bellboy GUSTINO walks by, calls out to HUEY.
C: GUSTINO
D: Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?
C: HUEY
D: It's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it.
N: GUSTINO laughs, waves.
C: GENE
D: I have to do something.
C: HUEY
D: What's that? You have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
E: taps his ear
C: GENE
D: I said I have to do something.
C: HUEY
D: I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
C: GENE
D: Is within himself.
N: GENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here. She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists all over the house. HUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his chair?
C: GENE
D: Drove me crazy. There must have been one on me. I didn't add up so she left. That's what attracted me to her In the first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn't sit around waiting for...whatever. She'd do something. She'd do something.
N: HUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a live one.
C: HUEY
D: Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks.
N: HUEY gestures for GENE to get down. GENE steps to the floor. He pays HUEY with a twenty.
C: HUEY
D: You got anything smaller?
C: GENE
D: Keep it.
C: HUEY
D: It's a twenty.
C: GENE
D: Keep it.
N: GENE is thinking about something.
C: HUEY
D: Well...thanks muchly...
N: GENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket.
C: GENE
D: Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
C: HUEY
D: Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
N: HUEY nods toward the bar.
C: GENE
D: Thanks.
N: GENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for the boys in white.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:35PM
N: GENE looks towards the Flower Street entrance. The van is still there. A bus pulls up. GENE walks past MR. SMITH.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You get another chance in ten minutes.
C: GENE
D: Then I have time for a drink.
N: He heads up to the bar.
C: MR. SMITH
D: All right, Mr. Watson, but make it just one. I don't want you...
N: But GENE is long gone.
S: INT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM
N: GENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked.
C: REPORTER
D: So where was I?
C: BARTENDER
D: I don't know. Something about the Governor's new regime.
N: GENE hears this and glances towards them.
C: REPORTER
D: Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers.
N: GENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street.
C: REPORTER
D: The white boys are in for it. When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United Nations.
N: The BARTENDER laughs. GENE quickly cuts across the lobby and out the smaller door onto Flower Street.
C: REPORTER
D: We're talking Custer's Last Stand here. The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest.
S: EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY - 12:3 6PM
N: GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving through the traffic. Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door, one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks inside the cab. No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks out the gun.
S: INT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM
N: The first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead.
C: GENE
D: Lynn!
E: a gasp
C: MS. JONES
D: Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.
E: O.S.
N: MS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on. GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles.
C: MS. JONES
D: What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff. The thing you gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind the seat?" Now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target. Maybe a thirty-eight? A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. How's about a three-fifty-seven? It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. What do you think? What's my poison?
E: softly
N: GENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. He lowers the gun, defeated.
C: MS. JONES
D: Well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-Jones to pull that thing out. Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger we've still got to see.
S: EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY
N: GENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away.
S: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:38PM
N: MS. JONES puts her gun down, raises a walkie-talkie.
C: MS. JONES
D: He's coming back in.
E: into the walkie-talkie
C: MR. SMITH
D: I've got him in the crosshairs.
E: filtered
S: INT. BUFFET AREA - DAY - 12:38PM
N: MR. SMITH near the entrance, eating some food. He watches GENE walk past him. Their eyes meet.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:39PM
N: GENE looks at his watch, then checks the itinerary once more. ECU - ITINERARY 12:45 - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Kim Multi- Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor ANGLE ON GENE-NEAR BUFFET AREA - 12:39PM GENE addresses another Bellboy, HECTOR who is moving luggage out to the street.
C: GENE
D: Pool Deck?
C: HECTOR
D: Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.
N: GENE thanks him and moves across the lobby MR. SMITH follows GENE
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - BAR AREA - DAY - 12:39PM
N: GENE heads toward the escalators. Ahead of him, he sees ELEANOR GRANT and BRENDAN GRANT surrounded by AIDES and SECURITY MEN facing a crowd of PRESS PEOPLE. The Governor and her husband have an arm around each other. They are smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple. They give each other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment. GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference. ANGLE ON BRENDAN GRANT - 12:3 9PM He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding questions from a few remaining REPORTERS. Farther on, ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage can be seen taking the escalator up. GENE heads that way, passing BRENDAN GRANT.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: My wife is not interested in negative campaigning. She wants to accentuate the positive. I don't know about you but I find that refreshing.
C: A REPORTER
D: Have you ever thought of running for office yourself?
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Me?
E: smiles, charmingly
N: A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN walks by. The Governor's husband's eyes follow her appreciatively as he says:
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: I'm just a business man.
N: ANGLE ON GENE - 12:40PM He nears the escalator. It's crowded and GENE is pulled into the midst of NEWS PEOPLE, TV, RADIO, PRESS. He joins the flow and lets it pull him along. GENE rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the crowd up two flights of the circular stairs. Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck.
S: EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - POOL, DECK - HIGH ANGLE - 12:41PM
N: About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and microphones in front of a podium.
S: EXT. POOL DECK - CLOSE ANGLE ON GENE - 12:41PM
N: GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics, turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along, trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a 2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side. 2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I can take you over here. GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm - which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among: PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts with a quick laugh. POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in a crowd like this. He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in an easy way. GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him. He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:
C: MR. SMITH
D: I know what you're thinking.
E: O.S.
N: GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him. He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.
C: GENE
D: What would you do in my place?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Me?
N: He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.
C: MR. SMITH
D: The bitch would be dead. Course I ain't sayin' which bitch.
N: He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie- talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the sidewalk four stories below. MR. SMITH goes ballistic. GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.
C: GENE
D: There's a plot to kill the Governor. If you don't believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun.
N: OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: So do you, Mr. Watson.
N: And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie- Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: You got this under control?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Yeah.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: It doesn't look like it.
C: MR. SMITH
D: It's under control.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: It better be.
N: OFFICER TRUST walks away. MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie- talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him to an isolated corner.
C: MR. SMITH
D: I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur.
C: WAITER M
D: Gentlemen...
E: O.S.
N: The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.
N: GENE shakes his head.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.
N: GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on.
C: MR. SMITH
D: There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch.
N: We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Nobody could make me laugh like him. We closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this image of himself. Thought he was con man. Always trying to shave the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always miss him. Tell me why.
C: GENE
D: What...?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Tell me why I miss him.
C: GENE
D: He's dead?
C: MR. SMITH
D: That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
C: GENE
D: How should I...?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Tell me why he's dead.
N: GENE stares at him for a beat.
C: GENE
D: You killed him.
C: MR. SMITH
D: That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
N: He moves in on GENE, crowding him. He breathes hard, looks like one insane piece of work.
C: MR. SMITH
D: I loved that motherfucker but I got the call and I put him down like a sick animal. So if you've got any doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver let me tell you something. I'd make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black Irish cocksucker's meat.
N: A wave of applause catches their attention. ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way. ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM He turns' back to GENE.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Do what you're supposed to do. Do it now.
N: He grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the mob. He searches, trying to spot him.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Shit!
N: ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on something ahead: It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this way and that, greeting supporters. GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at the end of his rope. He is going to do it. ANGLE ON ROSTRUM A local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone. LOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor of Los Angeles. The honorable Tom Bradley. The CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his way forward.
C: TOM BRADLEY
D: It is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you...
N: ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM He is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away. He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD.
C: TOM BRADLEY
D: ...a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
N: GENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and...
C: KRISTA
D: Feeling better?
E: O.S.
N: KRISTA BROOKS, the young woman from the elevator is next to him, smiling. He looks at her in confusion.
C: TOM BRADLEY
D: An iconoclast with class...
C: KRISTA
D: The elevator. You weren't feeling well.
N: GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT.
C: TOM BRADLEY
D: A genuine lady who's not afraid to get into the trenches...
C: KRISTA
D: Are you better now?
N: GENE turns, scans the crowd - no sign of MR. SMITH.
C: TOM BRADLEY
D: ...and go to the mat with greedy special interests...
N: GENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit unnerved.
C: TOM BRADLEY
D: The finest Governor our state has ever had...
N: Again GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around, facing the crowd, facing him.
C: TOM BRADLEY
D: My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor Grant!
N: ELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks.
C: GENE
D: My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
C: KRISTA
D: Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
C: GENE
D: You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
N: Krista looks at Gene.
C: KRISTA
D: Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
C: GENE
D: Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
N: Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help.
C: KRISTA
D: Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist you, he's our...
N: Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only, unnoticed by anyone else.
C: GENE
D: No! You have to listen to me.
E: sotto voce
N: Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene.
C: KRISTA
D: I'm listening, I'm listening.
N: ANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM ELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming LOCAL POLITICO.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: My friends, my good friends...
N: ANGLE ON THE CROWD Gene and Krista are gone.
S: EXT. BEHIND THE PLATFORM - DAY - 12:47PM
N: Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a ringing speech, accented with applause.
C: GENE
D: Please...please...you have to believe me... They have my daughter. They want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or they'll kill my daughter.
N: KRISTA tries to edge away.
C: KRISTA
D: All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
C: GENE
D: No! You can't! They're in on it.
C: KRISTA
D: I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
C: GENE
D: I don't know. One of them is following me. If he knew what I'd just told you they'd...
N: GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking he's going to shoot her.
C: GENE
D: Look, how did I get in here with this!?
N: KRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact.
C: KRISTA
D: I don't know.
C: GENE
D: You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
C: KRISTA
D: It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
N: GENE looks at her intently.
C: GENE
D: You're right, it is. Here.
E: beat
N: GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her fingers.
C: GENE
D: Will you trust me now?
N: She stares at the gun, at the strange man.
C: KRISTA
D: I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's one person we can go to.
C: GENE
D: The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
C: KRISTA
D: He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
N: She steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S voice is heard.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: ...I remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday. A phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible news...
E: O.S.
N: KRISTA checks her watch.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: My husband and child senselessly killed by a drunk driver.
E: O.S.
C: KRISTA
D: We've got about ten minutes.
C: GENE
D: Are you sure?
C: KRISTA
D: I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him. We will.
C: GENE
D: But...
C: KRISTA
D: Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
C: GENE
D: Okay...
N: She starts to lead him away.
C: GENE
D: Hey.
N: He stops her, points to the gun she still holds.
C: GENE
D: I think you better put that away.
C: KRISTA
D: I think you're right.
N: She pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away.
S: EXT. POOL DECK - DAY - 12:4 9PM
N: MR. SMITH still roams the crowd, looking for Gene.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy us, has a curious way of giving us strength.
N: He sees OFFICER TRUST who gives him a questioning look. He ignores it.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I doubt if I would be before you now, if I hadn't been put through that crucible of loss.
N: MR SMITH notices the JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE we met before. The man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle. MR. SMITH glances up toward what the man is shooting. Consternation and anger fill his face. ANGLE ON RED BONAVENTURE TOWER - 12:4 9PM What he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising. KRISTA stands at the glass looking down. Behind her, just glimpsed, is GENE. ANGLE ON MR. SMITH
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: And though I can never forget William and Bill Junior or the love I felt for them...
N: MR. SMITH cuts a wake through the CROWD.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I have found joy again in serving this great state. I have found love again in my second husband Brendan...

C: HALL GUARD
D: Ms. Brooks ...
C: KRISTA
D: Is he in?
C: HALL GUARD
D: Yes, ma'am.
N: They walk past him. He's a bit curious about GENE, but shrugs it off. GENE and KRISTA reach a door and knock.
C: GENE
D: Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
C: KRISTA
D: I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
N: The door opens. BRENDAN GRANT is framed there.
C: BRENDAN GRANT

C: KRISTA
D: We need to see you, Brendan.
N: She grabs GENE and pushes inside.
S: INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:51PM
N: Upscale suite. BRENDAN GRANT'S coat is draped on a chair. KRISTA moves past him, pulling GENE.
C: GENE
D: We have to hurry.
E: to KRISTA
C: KRISTA
D: I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: What? What are you talking about?
C: KRISTA
D: We need people we can "trust. We only have a few moments...
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: This is...this is insane. How do you know this?
C: GENE
D: I know it because I'm the one who's supposed to kill her.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: You are!? You brought this man here!? You brought this man to my room!?
E: to KRISTA
C: KRISTA
D: I had to. Her Security people may be involved...
N: There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, perhaps wearing glasses.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Is there a problem, Brendan?
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: There certainly is. This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor.
C: GENE
D: Not hired. They're blackmailing me.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Who is this "they"?
C: GENE
D: I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. Grant! They have my daughter. I'm not some lunatic. Your wife is in trouble. Someone is trying to kill her. Someone is trying to make me kill her. Please, listen...
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: And on the strength of this story, you bring this man to Brendan's suite? Does that show good judgment, Ms. Brooks? I'm just a friend of Brendan's, but it seems to me...
C: KRISTA
D: He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: What?
E: beat
C: KRISTA

C: KRISTA I
D: Have it.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
C: KRISTA
D: It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Could I see it?
N: KRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it awkwardly, examines it.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: My goodness. It certainly looks real.
N: He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: What's your opinion? You're the expert in these matters, supposedly.
N: GENE turns, to see who he is talking to. ANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak, MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the couch. He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Jesus Christ!
C: MR. SMITH
D: (calmly, staring at
C: GENE)
D: Yeah, I'd say it's real.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Are you out of your fucking mind!?
N: The door opens. OFFICER TRUST slides in quickly.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
E: sees KRISTA's body

D: Help me get her off the rug.
N: OFFICER TRUST checks the hall, shuts the door. They begin to drag her body to the bathroom. The MYSTERY MAN watches.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: What have you done to me!? Christ almighty!
N: GENE's eyes follow them. As if rousing from a sleep he comes to life.
C: GENE
D: No!
N: He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there, gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's
T: cutting off his air.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You fucked up.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: That's enough.
E: O.S.
N: The MYSTERY MAN grabs MR. SMITH'S arm, tries to pry him loose. MR. SMITH is beyond reason.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You want me to kill your kid!? You want me to kill you!?
N: GENE's eyes begin to roll back in his head. Everything begins fading to black. The blackness retreats in a rush and GENE finds himself staring at the butt of MR. SMITH'S gun, visible under his coat. He reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank into MR. SMITH, again, again. MR. SMITH'S shocked face falls away. GENE heads for the door.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Don't let him go!
N: OFFICER TRUST steps between GENE and the door. GENE shoots him down and is out the door.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: GENE stumbles out in the hall, gun in hand. He hurries down the hall, looking back to see the MYSTERY MAN and a wounded OFFICER TRUST spill out of Room 2503. The HALL OFFICER pulls his weapon MYSTERY MAN Get him! GENE fires at the HALL OFFICER who goes down. GENE rushes down the hall. One of the guest room door's opens and a MAN staggers out. It is a bloody, wounded MR. SMITH! GENE stops in shock.
C: GENE
D: I killed you.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You fucked up.
N: And MR. SMITH grabs him by the collar and throws him over a railing.
S: INT. THE LOBBY - MID-AIR - DAY
N: GENE is falling, falling. He passes the ascending elevator and gets a glimpse of MS. JONES and LYNN, pressed against the glass, her face a mask of terror. The floor rushes up to meet GENE and...
S: INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:5 6PM
N: ...he hits the floor, thrown there by MR. SMITH. His escape has been a dream. A wrist-watch fills the frame. It is GENE's. We are seeing his P.O.V. He's laying on the floor, his watch-hand in front of his face.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!
E: O.S.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Nearly doesn't count.
E: O.S.
N: Lose the P.O.V.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: I'm on record. I never wanted this. I wanted simplicity; a telescopic sight, a powerful rifle, but no. What was good enough for Oswald wasn't good enough for you two. You had to get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off the street, stick a gun in his hand.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: It's academic now. She had to be killed.
C: MR. SMITH
D: What were you going to do, Brendan? Lock her in a closet? You're in the fucking kitchen now. Get used to the heat. He's been seen all over the hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes. We even got him on video. It'll work. Don't worry about it.
N: GENE stirs on the floor.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Is he awake?
E: about GENE
C: MR. SMITH
D: Yeah.
N: He yanks GENE to his feet.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Oh Great. Why don't we just give him our home phone numbers while we're at it?
C: MR. SMITH
D: It doesn't matter what he hears.
N: He pulls GENE over to the bathroom door. Throws it open. GENE reacts to what he sees within.
C: MR. SMITH
D: That's what it looks like. She was alive a minute ago. Now she's dead. Because you wouldn't do what I told you to do.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Get going. You've only got a few minutes to pull it together.
N: MR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall. The door closes. Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are alone BRENDAN GRANT I don't know if we should go through with this.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: It's too late for that.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: There is a dead woman on my bathroom floor!
C: MYSTERY MAM
D: What about it? She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic. Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker.
E: breathing easier
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: He won't be doing any work once I get through with him.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: And in a few months you're in the Governor's mansion. The people'd make you king of California if they could.
N: BRENDAN GRANT laughs.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 12:57PM
N: OFFICER TRUST exits from the room and engages the HALL OFFICER in conversation down the hall. GENE and MR. SMITH turns the other way, walk. In an undertone:

C: MR. SMITH
D: Do you now, Mr. Watson?
C: GENE

C: MR. SMITH
D: Come back.
E: into the walkie-talkie
C: GENE
D: How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Come Back....Fucking Radio.
E: into the walkie-talkie
N: MR. SMITH is getting nothing but static. He angrily keys off, hisses at GENE:
C: MR.SMITH
D: I told you she'd be alright, if you do your job.
C: GENE
D: And I'm supposed to trust you?
C: MR. SMITH
D: What choice do you have?

N: The van can be seen below on Flower Street.
C: MR. SMITH

C: MR. SMITH
D: Do it!
N: He jabs the walkie-talkie next to GENE's ear.
C: LYNN
D: Daddy...?
E: V.O. filtered
N: And then a scream. The horrible sound of a little girl in terrible pain. It cuts through GENE like a stab in the heart.
C: GENE
D: Lynn!
N: He struggles to turn around. MR. SMITH kidney punches him, hard! GENE goes down on one knee. The car stops. SOMEONE starts to board it, stops in surprise. MR. SMITH sticks a badge in their face.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Security. Take the next car.
N: They back off. The doors close, the car continues its descent. MR. SMITH lifts the walkie-talkie.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Again.
C: GENE
D: No, please...
E: a gasp
N: Another bone-chilling scream from the walkie-talkie. GENE is ripped to his soul. MR. SMITH hauls him to his feet, shoves him against the glass.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You got one last chance. Half an hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill her myself. I'll rip her fucking head off right in front of you!

S: INT. THIRD FLOOR "GREEN" ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY - 12:59PM
N: GENE gets out of the elevator, almost getting caught in the closing doors. He can't even fight back at the doors. They pound him a couple of times before he is able to step clear of the elevator.

C: LYNN
D: Daddy, did you hear me scream?
E: O.S. filtered, giggling
S: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:00PM

E: O.S.
N: OMIT
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:01PM
N: GENE staggers over to the row of sinks. Leaning on one sink with both hands, his body shudders violently. And he throws up. A man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks. He sees GENE retching, turns away in disgust, and leaves quickly. GENE turns on the faucets.to wash the mess away. He tries to clean up, but catches his reflection in the mirror. He has trouble looking himself in the eye.
S: INT. THIRD FLOOR LOBBY - DAY - 1:01PM
N: MR. SMITH is fuming. Into the walkie-talkie:
C: MR. SMITH
D: The next time I tell you to do something, you goddamn well do it!
S: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:01PM
N: MS. JONES tries to be private on the walkie-talkie.
C: MS. JONES
D: Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit a screaming kid in traffic, come out here and do it yourself. He got the message, didn't he?

N: GENE walks over, climbs into a chair.
C: HUEY
D: Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective.

C: HUEY
D: So, are you a visitor or are you lucky enough to...
N: ...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes.
C: HUEY
D: You got a complaint?
E: as he looks up

C: GENE
D: You remember me?
C: HUEY
D: I remember. The big tipper.
C: GENE
D: Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
C: HUEY
D: Oh, man...
C: GENE
D: Please. Something is going to happen...
C: HUEY
D: What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
C: GENE
D: Please...
C: HUEY
D: Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change? You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
N: HUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up. From behind him:
C: MR. SMITH
D: Come on, let's get some privacy.
C: GENE
D: He's deaf.
N: It spills out of GENE almost without volition. There's a note of pleading hidden in it. GENE slowly points a thumb at HUEY's "Disabled Veteran" sign.
C: GENE
D: He can't hear a word we're saying.
N: MR. SMITH looks at the sign. HUEY stops what he's doing - "What the fuck?" He almost says it aloud, then:
C: MR. SMITH
D: You wouldn't be kidding me now, would you, Mr. Watson? Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't hear me? Nigger?
E: to HUEY's back
N: HUEY's face settles into something cold. What's he going to do? He stands, looks at GENE, who stares back at him, then slowly turns around, looks at MR. SMITH - and breaks into a jive-ass grin.
C: HUEY
D: Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient just got multiplied by two. What do you think of that? You'll have to forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm deef as a post. Compliments of the United States Army... ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a shine, sir? You don't see your face, you don't pay.
E: does a snappy salute
N: MR. SMITH is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Yeah, sure, give me a shine... ...shine.
E: loudly looks at GENE
N: HUEY goes to work on his shoes.
C: MR. SMITH
D: I'm putting your toy back in your pocket, Mr. Watson.
N: Unseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun being transferred to GENE's pocket.
C: MR. SMITH
D: It's all wound up. Now let's get out your itinerary.
N: GENE does. "1:'30 - California Leads the Nation into the 21st Century - California Ballroom - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant and Brendan Grant" It is the last entry.

C: MR. SMITH
D: You know what I'm gonna do.
E: glances again at HUEY
C: GENE
D: What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
N: MR. SMITH doesn't reply.
C: GENE
D: It would be a lot less trouble just to let me talk to her.
N: They stare at each other for a few beats. Then MR. SMITH checks HUEY out and gets out the walkie-talkie.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Come Back.
E: into it

D: Yeah.
E: O.S. filtered
C: MR. SMITH

E: O.S. filtered
C: LYNN
D: To be a hero?
S: INT. BONAVENTURE LOBBY - DAY - 1:05PM
N: MR. SMITH, GENE and HUEY in situ.
C: GENE
D: No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
C: LYNN
D: All right.
E: O.S. filtered
C: GENE
D: He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
C: MR. SMITH
D: That's enough.
N: He reaches for the walkie-talkie, but GENE stares him down. Back to the walkie-talkie:
C: GENE
D: Will you promise me that?
C: LYNN

N: He reaches down, snaps his fingers in HUEY's face. HUEY looks up.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You done yet?
C: HUEY
D: Just about.
N: He gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away.
C: HUEY
D: Two dollars, if it pleases you.
C: MR. SMITH
D: It doesn't. I remember when it was a fuckin' quarter.
N: He throws a couple dollars to HUEY. To GENE as he stalks away:
C: MR. SMITH
D: Twenty-five minutes.
N: TO HIS BACK:
C: HUEY
D: Thanks for the tip.
N: HUEY turns back to GENE. They stare at each other.
C: HUEY
D: Mister, what are you dragging me into?
C: GENE
D: I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
C: HUEY
D: Cover your mouth.
C: GENE
D: What?
C: HUEY
D: This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
C: GENE
D: That's right.
C: HUEY
D: Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
N: GENE lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. HUEY pretends to work on his shoes.
C: HUEY
D: That was your kid on the walkie- talkie?
C: GENE
D: My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
C: HUEY
D: In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
C: GENE
D: There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
C: HUEY
D: What are you supposed to do?
C: GENE
D: Kill the Governor.
N: HUEY checks his perimeters, then:
C: HUEY
D: I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
C: GENE
D: One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
C: HUEY
D: Who?
C: GENE
D: The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
C: HUEY
D: Oh, Jesus ...
C: GENE
D: No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
C: HUEY
D: Then why'd you drag me into it?
C: GENE
D: It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
E: getting emotional
N: He gets out her picture, stares at it.
C: GENE
D: It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter. That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
C: HUEY
D: Yeah, all right, listen...
C: GENE
D: So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
E: running on
N: HUEY takes his wooden brush and whacks GENE on the foot, snapping him from his downward spiral.
C: HUEY
D: Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
C: GENE
D: I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
C: HUEY
D: Yeah, now listen. I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
C: GENE
D: What are you going to do?
C: HUEY
D: I haven't the faintest idea. Go on now. I'll get word to you.
N: GENE gets down.
C: GENE
D: If nothing else, someone heard my story.
N: He gives HUEY a twenty.
C: GENE
D: Keep the change.
C: HUEY
D: Don't think I won't.
N: GENE just stands there. HUEY has to give him a little push.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:09PM
N: GENE turns and walks across the lobby toward the bar. His mind is racing. As he passes MR. SMITH...
C: GENE
D: I need a drink.
N: MR. SMITH rises immediately, looks back at HUEY. HUEY gives him a symbolic tip of the hat. MR. SMITH follows GENE.
S: INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY - 1:11PM
N: GENE finds a stool at the empty part of the bar. The place is half-full, noisy. The television is showing a game show. The BARTENDER comes over.
C: GAME SHOW HOST
D: ...and time is running out...
E: O.S. over television
C: GENE
D: Give me a ...a gingerale?
N: MR. SMITH sits -at the other end of the bar. The BARTENDER gets him a beer. GENE and MR. SMITH lock eyes in the mirror. Between them, a couple of T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS are grabbing a quick beer. A video camera resides on the bar by them. GENE notices OFFICER TRUST, walking by on a level above, watching him. T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Man, I thought she was going to get out the violins.
C: TV REPORTER
D: No shit. If I hear that stop the violence routine one more time I'm going to shoot somebody.
N: A WAITRESS appears suddenly at GENE's elbow, surprising him. She puts a basket of pretzels next to him and a coaster next to his drink.
C: WAITRESS
D: Here's your Ginger Ale, sir.
C: DOWN THE BAR:
D: T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Politicians.
C: TV REPORTER
D: They're all the same.
N: The WAITRESS is tapping a long fingernail against the bar. GENE looks down and sees it. A note on the coaster. "Men's Room - Huey." The WAITRESS turns the coaster over, and leaves. GENE looks down the bar at MR. SMITH, drinking, unaware.
C: TV REPORTER
D: You know what bothers me?
N: GENE looks at his watch.
C: TV REPORTER
D: When they get all weepy eyed about the "ordinary citizen", the "regular Joe", the "normal American". Gimme a break. There ain't no such animal. We're a nation of two hundred forty million special interest groups.
N: GENE stands.
C: GENE
D: Well, I'm just a regular guy.
N: The T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS stare at him.
C: TV REPORTER
D: Is that right?
C: GENE
D: Yeah, that's right. But I've built a good solid business out of nothing. Don't underestimate the regular guy.
N: He heads for the open lobby.
C: BARTENDER
D: Sir, you haven't paid.
C: GENE
D: It's on the Special Interest at the end of the bar.
N: GENE jerks a thumb at MR. SMITH and is gone. MR. SMITH starts to follow him. The BARTENDER is right with him.
C: BARTENDER
D: Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop.
N: MR. SMITH slaps some money on the bar and leaves. T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Left field bleachers heard from.
C: T.V. REPORTER
D: Laughs.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:13PM
N: MR. SMITH scans the lobby trying to spot Gene. OFFICER TRUST comes up behind him.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: Where is he? Did you lose him?
C: MR. SMITH
D: Shut up.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM
N: Elsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be clocks everywhere. A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris. The souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display, with the logos of various LA sports teams.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - RESTAURANT AREA - DAY - 1:14PM
N: The restaurant, the travel agency, the newsstand, all have clocks. 1:14 . Everywhere he turns. GENE has to look at his watch. 1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once. GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick over one number in a thunderous chorus.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM
N: He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the chair - "Gone to Lunch" and there is a clock face with moveable hands. "We'll be back at 1:30."
C: GENE
D: Let's all hope so.
E: sotto voice
N: And he enters the Men's Room. Across the lobby MR. SMITH spots him, heads that way.
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM
N: GENE enters to find HUEY and GUSTINO the Bellboy. HUEY runs to the door, keeping a lookout.
C: HUEY
D: Quick, off with the shoes and pants. Trade with Gustino. The big guy's coming.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:16PM
N: MR. SMITH marching towards the Men's Room.
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM
N: HUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other, uncomfortable, to say the least.
C: HUEY
D: C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.
N: GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same. GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small for GUSTINO. GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door. HUEY comes back from the door.
C: HUEY
D: Gustino! Drop 'em!
N: GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's pants still up. He drops them.
C: HUEY
D: And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses you?
N: HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only". He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in. His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles. MR. SMITH smirks and leaves. The Janitor raps on GUSTINO's stall with the mop.
C: JANITOR
D: Fue.
E: Gone.
S: INT. SERVICE HALL - DAY - 1:17PM
N: HUEY and GENE move down a drab service corridor. Boxes stacked on both sides, floor buffers at rest, shelves with cleaning supplies. GENE notices for the first time that HUEY has a pronounced limp. They come upon IRENE the Cleaning Woman. She joins them moving down the corridor.
C: HUEY
D: Meet Irene.
C: GENE
D: Hi.
C: HUEY
D: Irene is going to help.
C: GENE
D: Thank you.
N: IRENE takes GENE's hand and leads him along at a half-trot.
C: GENE
D: Where am I going?
S: INT. BONAVENTURE - SERVICE ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 1:17PM
N: They come through a short corridor and onto the service elevator.
C: HUEY
D: You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
C: GENE
D: Yeah.
C: HUEY
D: You're going to go see her.
C: GENE
D: What!?
N: The elevator doors close.
S: INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAT - 1:17PM
N: IRENE punches the button for the twenty-fifth floor.
C: HUEY
D: You sure she's asleep?
C: IRENE
D: I took up extra pillows. She take a nap before her big speech.
C: GENE
D: What am I supposed to say to her?
C: HUEY
D: It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
N: HUEY takes a pillow and a blanket from IRENE'S cart and puts it into GENE's arms IRENE You don't have to save me. I got nothin' to do with it. You ain't gettin' no key from me.
C: HUEY
D: Irene...?
E: shocked
N: The service elevator stops. IRENE pushes her cart out into the hall signalling them to stay put for a second. She starts moving out into the hall, the card key falls on the floor.
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM
N: At the other end of the hall the HALL OFFICER turns when he hears her approach.
S: INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY -
N: GENE and HUEY hover in the door of the service elevator. Gene reaches down and snags the card key at his feet.
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM
N: The HALL OFFICER has to move his table aside so Irene can pass with the cart. As he turns,
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY
N: HUEY pushes GENE across the hall to the door of the Governors bedroom. The Service Elevator door closes.
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM
N: HALL OFFICER turns quickly at the noise.
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY
N: GENE holds totally still in the alcove outside her room.
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM
N: HALL OFFICER looks suspiciously, and finally sits back down.
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY
N: GENE uses the key to let himself into
S: INT. ROOM 2510 - 1:18PM
N: Lit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands over her, not knowing how to begin.
C: GENE
D: Excuse me...
E: softly
N: ELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Who the hell are you?
N: She sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting his hand on top of hers on top of the phone.
C: GENE
D: No, please.
N: They stare at each other for a beat. She bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up to the bed. Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not fearless.
C: GENE
D: Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: My security people are right next door.
C: GENE
D: I appreciate that.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
C: GENE
D: If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: That's...a comfort to hear.
C: GENE
D: I have a problem.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Ah.
C: GENE
D: Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
N: She studies him.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I remember you...in the elevator.
C: GENE
D: That's right.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: You were very nervous.
C: GENE
D: It was because I had this...in my pocket
N: He slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in.
C: GENE
D: I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to say.
N: She smiles.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Of course. But suppose we set up an appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you're cutting into my nap time.
E: friendly as can be
N: Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of constituent...
C: GENE
D: Krista Brooks is dead.
N: She freezes, slowly replaces the phone.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: How do you know that?
C: GENE
D: I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
N: She turns to him.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: You shot her?
C: GENE
D: No.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Who did?
C: GENE
D: I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: What?
C: GENE
D: And your husband works for somebody else.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: What the hell are you saying?
N: GENE glances at the bedside clock. He looks back to the Governor.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:19PM
N: An increasingly edgy MR. SMITH is looking at the Men's Room door. He glances over to OFFICER TRUST who's keeping an eye on him. He looks at his watch again, then gets up and heads for the Men's Room.
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:19PM
N: MR. SMITH enters. HECTOR is at the urinal. MR. SMITH checks out the feet under the stall. He has to bend over to check properly. GENE''s shoes, GENE' s pants legs. HECTOR notices MR. SMITH'S actions. MR. SMITH is aware that he's been noticed, but he is very suspicious. HECTOR flushes the urinal. MR. SMITH stays by the stall. He is going to look over the top of the stall. He rises on his tiptoes. But HECTOR is staring at him like he's a pervert. MR. SMITH is suddenly embarrassed. He backs away from the stall. HECTOR washes his hands, watching MR. SMITH in the mirror. MR. SMITH leaves. HECTOR dries his hands. He walks over to the stall and knocks on the door.
C: HECTOR
D: He's gone.
N: And GUSTINO tosses a Bellboy jacket over the top of the stall. HECTOR puts it on.
C: HECTOR
D: Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? You need to eat more fiber.
C: GUSTINO
D: You got anything to read?
E: O.S.
S: INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:21PM
N: The clock on the nightstand. ELEANOR GRANT sits against the headboard. GENE sits on the edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in his hand.
C: GENE
D: I knew you wouldn't believe me.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
C: GENE
D: I don't blame you. I don't have any proof. But nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. You can't be totally oblivious. You must suspect something. You're doing things which are making people angry. People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. You know them better than me. How much does it mean to them? How far would they go to hang onto it?
N: Her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. GENE sees it, hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor. Excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.
C: GENE
D: There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
E: smiling, covering her inner thought
C: GENE
D: It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
N: GENE, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. He takes the plunge.
C: GENE
D: This? I've never even fired one.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Indeed.
N: ELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging the room into blackness.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Franco! Franco.'
E: in the blackness
N: GENE slips out into the hall as the connecting room door flies open. Light from the other room spills in. FRANCO rushes in, pulling a gun.
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 1:22PM
N: The HALL OFFICER jumps from his chair and runs into the suite
S: INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY
N: GENE quickly moves to the Service Elevator and pushes the button.
S: INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:23PM
N: ELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame.
C: FRANCO
D: What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?
N: She hesitates.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream, Franco.
S: INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1:23PM
N: The service elevator opens and GENE rushes out. He hurries down the dim service corridor. Suddenly an arm snakes out of the blackness and grabs him! HUEY steps into the light.
C: HUEY
D: Well?
C: GENE
D: I don't know.
C: HUEY
D: What are you going to do now?
C: GENE
D: I don't know. I have to get back.
N: GENE keeps moving fast. HUEY limps to keep up
C: HUEY
D: What are you going to do!?
C: GENE
D: This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
N: HUEY watches him disappear.
S: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:23PM
N: MR. SMITH sees the T.V. TECHNICIAN and REPORTER leaving the bar with their equipment.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: Where is he?
E: O.S. alarmed
N: MR. SMITH looks at the man who has appeared behind him.
C: MR. SMITH
D: In the john.

C: OFFICER TRUST
D: Get moving.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
C: OFFICER TRUST
D: It's time. It's time now.
N: MR. SMITH scowls and heads for the Men's Room.
S: INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:24PM
N: A different watch. The minute hand moves to: It is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie, puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car.
C: LYNN
D: Where are we going?
C: MS. JONES
D: Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
N: She pulls the van out into traffic.
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:24PM
N: MR. SMITH bursts into the Men's Room. He goes to the stall and lifts his fist to pound on the door.
C: MR. SMITH
D: Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's up!
N: The stall door opens and GENE comes out, zipping up his pants. He brushes right past MR. SMITH, heads for the door. MR. SMITH reaches out, grabs him.
C: MR. SMITH
D: You forgot to wash your hands.
N: He throws him against the sinks. GENE washes his hands. MR. SMITH leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above the sink, GENE sees the stall door swings open. GUSTINO Is huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. MR. SMITH doesn't notice.
C: MR. SMITH
D: I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I know you're not just a regular guy, see, I know that. Even if you don't know it yourself. Maybe that's why I picked you.
N: GENE steps between MR. SMITH and the open stall door.
C: GENE
D: I know what I have to do. I'll do it. Let's go.
N: And'they exit the Men's Room. GUSTINO slumps with relief.
S: INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:25PM
N: Other lights have been turned on. ELEANOR GRANT is fixing her hair in the mirror. FRANCO is cleaning up the broken lamp. There is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it opens, revealing BRENDAN GRANT. The MYSTERY MAN hovers in the background.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Hey, El, how's the head?
N: She turns, locks eyes with the MYSTERY MAN.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Eleanor.
N: She nods, turns back to the mirror.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: It's an important speech.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: I'd say critical, not that it's any of my business.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: It's just another speech in a Tower of Babel so high that Nimrod himself would be put to shame. Cancel. Make my apologies.
N: In the mirror she takes note of BRENDAN GRANT and the MYSTERY MAN exchange a look.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Excuse me.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: I'll trot along. Nice to see you, Eleanor.
N: BRENDAN steps into the room, shuts the door.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: What's he doing here?
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Who, him? Just visiting.
C: ELEANOR GRANT T
D: Hings have changed, Brendan. I thought you understood that.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: He's my friend. And he did help you to get elected, after all.
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Don't remind me.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: What happened here?
E: re the broken lamp
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Nothing. I broke a lamp.
N: Brendan steps behind Eleanor and puts his arms around her affectionately.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Eleanor, please. I'll put it this way. This speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do you say?
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
N: ELEANOR GRANT looks at him, almost sadly. She steps toward the dressing table to fix her hair
C: ELEANOR GRANT
D: All right, I'll do it.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: That's my girl.

C: T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
D: I can't get through. Walkie-Talkies don't work from here. There's too much concrete and stuff.

ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT She spots Gene in the crowd, pushing toward her, gun drawn. Her eyes widen in fear. BRENDAN GRANT follows her gaze. His eyes widen in something other than fear.

C: GENE
D: Look out!
N: Pandemonium. Total chaos. People scattering. The Gun in the booth swings from Gene to ELEANOR GRANT. Mr. Smith fires, but his target is blocked by a panicked guest who is hit.

He falls onto ELEANOR GRANT and they both fall down hard on the steps. Blood is everywhere. ANGLE ON GENE He looks over and sees ELEANOR GRANT, beneath FRANCO, looking very dead. He careens toward a door. ANGLE ON PODIUM On the dais, BRENDAN GRANT crawls over to where FRANCO lays, half on top of ELEANOR GRANT. They are both still, eyes closed. BRENDAN looks down at his wife's face, splattered with blood.
C: BRENDAN GRANT
D: My God, he did it!
N: The Governor suddenly and violently gasps for breath. Her eyes snap open and burn into BRENDAN. She has heard her worst suspicions confirmed. BRENDAN'S a great liar, but even he can't hide the shock and fear on his face.

S: INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY
N: The dais. FRANCO takes a shuddering breath. ELEANOR GRANT pulls herself free, leans over him. She rips opens his shirt revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm. His eyes flutter open.
