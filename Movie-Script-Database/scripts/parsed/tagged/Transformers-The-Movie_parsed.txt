T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. SPACE
N: A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction. Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it. PUSH DOWN TO:
S: EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE
N: Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as Vesuvius erupted. ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very different context, but for now, he is running from the ever- growing mist that threatens to engulf him. ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.
C: ARBLUS
D: Transform and flee, Kranix! You must warn all you meet of the horror of Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid.
C: KRANIX
D: Arblus! No!
N: ANGLE ON KRANIX The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a small rocket ship and... TRACK WITH KRANIX AS... He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere, we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb with a gaping maw and a field of electricity. PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct collision course with... MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish metal one.
C: NARRATOR
D: It is the year 2005. The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron. But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland.
N: CLOSER ON GREEN MOON At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then, pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on Cybertron. ANGLE ON IRONHIDE He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned on Cybertron.
C: IRONHIDE
D: Every time I look into this thing, my circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna start bustin' Deceptichops?
N: ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion plans for Cybertron.
C: OPTIMUS PRIME
D: We still don't have enough Energon cubes to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.
C: IRONHIDE
D: Then let me make another run to Autobot City on Earth. I'll bring you back more cubes than you'll know what to do with.
N: ANGLE ON PRIME He solemnly hands down an order
C: PRIME
D: Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.
N: ANGLE ON IRONHIDE He raises a fist in a warwhoop!
C: IRONHIDE YAHOO!
D: Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.
E: looking into monitor
N: A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN" Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.
C: OPTIMUS PRIME
D: Jazz, report security status.
E: V.O.
N: COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES
C: JAZZ
D: No sign of Decepticons in this sector, Prime.
C: PRIME
D: What about Moon Base 2?
C: JAZZ
D: Jazz to Moon Base 2.
N: PAN UP and through the sky to -
C: ANOTHER MOON
D: This is the second moon. It is much closer to Cybertron than the first one. This is where Bumblebee and Spike are stationed.
C: JAZZ
D: Jazz to Moon Base 2.
E: V.O.
N: ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE They stand together a communication console. Spike is now 35 years old. Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart) Cybertron. I (club) Decepticons.
C: BUMBLEBEE
D: Bumblebee and Spike here.
C: JAZZ
D: We're about to send up the bird. Any Decepticon shenanigans in your sector?
E: V.O.
C: BUMBLEBEE
D: All clear, Jazz.
E: pause
C: SPIKE
D: Hey, Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I miss him, and tell him I'll be coming home as soon as we've kicked Megatron's tail across the galaxy.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE SHUTTLE
N: Ironhide and Prowl sit at the controls, running a series of pre-launch tests.

N: ANGLE ON PRIME, CLIFFJUMPER, AND THE OTHERS Standing at the Command Center, watching:
C: PRIME
D: Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.
C: CLIFFJUMPER
D: Five...Four...Three...Two...
N: THE LUNAR "MOUNTAIN" Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.
C: CLIFFJUMPER
D: One....
N: Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or something blows away revealing -- The shuttle!
C: CLIFFJUMPER
D: Liftoff.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of fire. As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in smoke and fire which slowly clears. ANGLE ON PRIME As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.
C: PRIME
D: Now, all we need is a little Energon and a lot of luck.
N: ANGLE BEHIND PRIME We see a bank of computers. Suddenly, a small tape deck pops open... a cassette pops out and transforms into... ...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.
T: DISSOLVE TO:

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE SHUTTLE
N: Ironhide is at the controls.
C: IRONHIDE
D: If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can sure as shootin' dodge a couple of asteroids.
N: Suddenly, there is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship, and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.
C: PROWL
D: You were saying?
C: IRONHIDE
D: That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast of light and they turn to see...
E: IRKED
N: ANGLE ON THE SHIP The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see - MEGATRON! In all his glory.
C: MEGATRON
D: Die Autobots!
N: Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms and Starscream fires.
C: BRAWN
D: is cut in half by Megatron's blast.
C: ON PROWL
D: as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.
C: THE INSECTICONS
D: ...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for... ...an ARMY of other Decepticons including Laserbeak who enter, firing.
N: IRONHIDE AND RATCHET While FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER... ... then blasted apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments. ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons flood past them, taking positions and searching for other living Autobots.
C: MEGATRON
D: This was almost too easy, Starscream.
C: STARSCREAM
D: Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat: the Autobots moon base.
C: MEGATRON
D: You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another one.
E: MORE
C: MEGATRON
D: But when we slip by their security systems in their own ship and destroy Autobot city, the Autobots will be vanquished forever!
E: CONT'D
C: IRONHIDE
D: Fat chance, Megatron!
N: Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings him against the wall.
C: MEGATRON
D: Such heroic nonsense!
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. EARTH - CLOSE SHOT- MINIATURE RADAR SCREEN
N: A child's hands hold a scanner device which tracks a TRAVELING BLIP across a star map towards a pulsing dot which represents the Earth.
C: DANIEL
D: The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint zeta.
E: V.O.
C: ON DANIEL
D: Daniel, a classic twelve year old American boy watches the portable viewer which is like an over-sized Boy Scout compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an old fashioned "fishin' hole" on Earth - surrounded by weeping willows, assorted trees and shrubs, and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt, the line floating lazily out on the water.
C: DANIEL
D: Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device, hits a button, and watches, it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy hillside we change angle to feature...
C: HOT ROD
D: an "adolescent" Autobot. He is in robot mode, sitting with his fishing rod held between two fingers, looking bored with it all.
C: HOT ROD
D: Talk about dull......!
E: CONT'D
N: Then, he tosses the rod into the water. ON DANIEL RIDING HIS HOVERBOARD UP THE HILL
C: DANIEL
D: Hurry or we'll miss it!
E: calling excitedly
C: HOT ROD
D: lopes up hill after Daniel.
C: HOT ROD
D: If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in style! Hot Rod catches up with Daniel, scoops him off his hoverboard, TRANSFORMS to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST OF HILL with Daniel in the front seat.
E: CONT'D
N: ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about. (DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions of volts. Near all of these various things are energon compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up into neighboring hills for an overview of the - CIRCULAR LANDING AREA which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure and natural surroundings.
C: DANIEL
D: Hey! Let me out.
C: HOT ROD
D: Why settle for a peek when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain?
C: DANIEL
D: But we're not supposed to go beyond City limits!
C: HOT ROD
D: Chromo-Chicken!
N: ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS KUP - a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod barrels through a sign which reads: "STOP -THIS AREA OFF LIMITS", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind
C: KUP
D: disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the mountain.
C: KUP
D: Cam bustin', turbo revvin' young punk.
E: CONT'D to sound like swearing
T: CUT TO:
N: MOUNTAIN ABOVE AUTOBOT CITY- LOOKOUT POINT Hot Rod arrives at a viewing platform carved in mountainside and TRANSFORMS back to humanoid mode. Daniel rushes to a set of PUBLIC VIEWING BINOCULARS and peers into them.
C: HOT ROD
D: This is it! Now take a squint through those babies.
C: DANIEL
D: Hot Rod, look! There's a hole in the shuttle!
C: HOT ROD
D: What!?
N: DANIEL'S P.O.V - BINOCULAR MATTE - THE SHUTTLE The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle mars the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship. ANGLE ON DANIEL AND HOT ROD Hot Rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out of his eyes. HOT ROD'S POV - THE SHUTTLE Hot Rod's vision, now, infinitely better than human vision, spots something truly disturbing -- -- Starscream, and several Constructicons inside the ship!
C: HOT ROD
D: Decepticons!
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE ON HOT ROD Drawing his gun, he starts FIRING on the shuttle.
C: HOT ROD

N: ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE Suddenly it cracks open, and Decepticons shoot out of the wreckage like toys from a pinata. CLOSE - MEGATRON In mid-air
C: MEGATRON
D: Attack!
E: shouting to forces he looks down and fires
N: HOT ROD AND DANIEL Hot Rod pulls Daniel back as Megatron's BLAST SHEARS OFF the VIEWING PLATFORM which crumbles and falls down the steep mountain!
C: HOT ROD
D: Hang on!
N: Putting Daniel under one arm, he pivots and kicks up at... ...Hook and Scavenger who are descending on him in humanoid mode... ...causing them both to crash against the mountainside which starts a... ...landslide which Hot Rod "rides" down the slope, pursued by... ... Decepticon FIRE.
C: HOT ROD
D: WHoooooooaaah

C: SHRAPNEL
D: who is flying nearby.
C: BLITZWING
D: transforms to robot mode and turns as... Kup comes flying, feet first, into Blitzwing knocking him off the mountain ledge.
N: FOLLOW Kup as he lands in front of Hot Rod, who is just coming to a stop at the bottom with Daniel.
C: HOT ROD
D: Not bad for an old timer!
C: KUP
D: Old timer?! That's something you'll never be if you don't get back to the city. You know what we used to do with cocky, insubordinate upstarts?
E: gruffly
C: HOT ROD
D: Save it.
E: interrupting
C: STARSCREAM
D: transforming into jet mode, fires on them with laser bursts which...
N: ... chew up the ground beside them. HOT ROD AND KUP with Daniel race toward Autobot City, transforming into vehicle mode as shots gouge the terrain around them.

C: PERCEPTOR
D: transforms to humanoid and runs toward...... ... Three new Autobots, ARCEE, a lovely female Autobot of about Hot Rod's age, SPRINGER, a very muscular and bantering "Indiana Jones" type Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS, the large and soldierly City Commander.

C: STARSCREAM
D: There's no escape...Uuuuh! Just then, the floor of the courtyard STARTS TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the floor snaps shut like the halves of a gigantic steel shelled clam, trapping Starscream's foot.
C: STARSCREAM
D: Agggggggh! My foot!
N: ANGLE ON SPRINGER AND ARCEE as they make it through an archway which TRANSFORMS INTO A STEEL SHIELD as they run through ON STARSCREAM - HIS FOOT STILL CAUGHT IN "CLAM" OF COURTYARD He struggles to get free before he is crunched by the still transforming city. In the nick of time, he shoots a "shoe horn" like projection from his wrist and pulls his boot free, then... ...dodges away. ... The "clam" shape RETRACTS COMPLETELY and more armored shielding SLIDES INTO PLACE TO COVER where the Courtyard was. He winces in mid-air and flies away as the city continues to transform to a fortress below.

Decepticons fire on him, but he takes the shots, and... Spinning and whirling like the Sundance Kid, he takes a lot out. Then, Decepticons attempt to block his charge and Prime... ...

C: MEGATRON
D: Enshrine me!
E: weakly clutching at Starscream's hand, gasping
C: STARSCREAM
D: Take this scrap to Cybertron! Astrotrain, transform and get us out of here!
E: drops Megatron's hand coldly, calls to other Decepticons
N: ANOTHER ANGLE- ASTROTRAIN as he MOVES ONTO SCENE in Humanoid mode, showing battle burns and scars. Then, he converts to train mode, and rolls through a crowd of generic Decepticons, crushing many under his wheels, as he makes his way towards Starscream. ANGLE ON THE EXODUS Ramjet, Thrust, Dirge, the Constructicons, Soundwave and his cassettes, et.al. run towards Astrotrain. ANGLE ON KUP AND ARCEE They fight for a moment, then they notice their attackers are beating feet...

N: ANGLE ON ASTROTRAIN The shuttle takes off, leaving a number of generic Decepticons behind, who immediately raise their hands upon realizing that they are surrounded by Autobots.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: OPTIMUS PRIME
D: as he lies on an improvised bier-like platform, a profusion of electricity discharging tubes and "plasma" bottle devices hooked up to his arms and into his gaping middle wound.
C: SCANNERS
D: emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic patterns but sounds and wave patterns are steadily growing weaker and weaker.
C: PERCEPTOR
D: is bent over Prime, in microscope mode, examining him... He then transforms and straightens up, his voice strained and cracking with emotion.

D: Until that day...
E: voice failing, pressing on with it
N: Until all are one... Continue the struggle... (sags, gasps, hanging on) Transfer the Matrix of Leadership. TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then, pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light, reaches in, and lifts out -- THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX, -- and holds it for a moment in his hand. ANGLE ON ALL The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal, seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest, closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary, and extremely powerful glow from his eyes. ON KUP, HOT ROD, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR They are all full of great sorrow. ON PRIME - HE DIES All of his lights go out, including his eyes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:

C: UNICRON
D: You exaggerate.
C: MEGATRON
D: The point is, he is dead! And the Matrix died with him.
C: UNICRON
D: No. It has been passed to their new leader. Get it for me.
C: MEGATRON
D: Why should I? What's in it for me?
C: UNICRON
D: Your bargaining posture is highly dubious, but very well, I will provide you with a new body, and new troops to command.
C: MEGATRON
D: And...
C: UNICRON
D: And nothing.
N: You belong to me now.
C: MEGATRON
D: I belong to nobody.

T: CUT TO:
N: THE DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES - STARSCREAM This is the closest thing the Decepticons have to a throne room. It is a massive, circular room with tombs of old leaders, and a raised area where Starscream stands. STARSCREAM AND OTHERS The Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on his shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held high, but ready for action should anybody question Starscream's rule.

S: INT. ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE - "COCKPIT"
N: shuttle ROCKS WITH DIRECT HITS as Ultra Magnus struggles with controls
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Remember what we did off Beta Four!
C: KUP
D: I remember it well.
N: ON THE SHUTTLES They fire (O.S.) at... A LARGE ASTEROID With incredible precision, the rays strike the asteroid, splitting it in two parts. ANGLE ON ONE OF THE ASTEROID HALVES It shoots through space and strikes another asteroid, which, breaks into several pieces, many of them angling back towards...
C: GALVATRON'S SHIPS
D: which swerve to avoid them as....
N: THE OTHER ASTEROID PART Hits another moon or asteroid or general rock in space, doing the same thing... WIDEN SHOT to show that the pieces are shooting around like pool balls after an incredibly violent break... ... zinging into each other... .... Narrowly missing Galvatron's ship... ... Filling space with incredible amounts of Dust, lava from inside the moons, multi-colored gasses, explosions and generally making a mess of space. (Note: think of this scene as the "Asteroids" video game.) ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOT SHUTTLES As all of this is going on, they jam into hyperspace... ... Corkscrewing and arcing off into the galaxy, leaving only blurred images of themselves as...
C: GALVATRON'S SHIP
D: emerges from the chaos.
N: ON CYCLONUS
C: CYCLONUS
D: The explosions jammed my sensors. I have lost track of the Autobots!
E: pause

N: DEEP AND SERENE SPACE - ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE AND DINOBOT
C: SHUTTLE
D: Possible song - optimistic adventure with the suggestion that all dreams might not happen.
N: as both shuttles soar majestically through the vast depth of infinite space.
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Congratulations Autobots, we've lost 'em at least for a while. So rest up. We'll refuel on the Junk Planet and work out our battle plan there.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DINOBOT SHUTTLE - KUP
N: Kup sits spinning yarns, leaning back in chair as Grimlock, Sludge, Slag and Swoop lie, lounge, sit with chin on hands, all listening like little kids to a bedtime story - in rapt attention
C: KUP
D: Yep, I remember the dust was so thick off Beta 4 had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors....
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me, Grimlock, know all about wipers! Want to hear good part of story!
E: impatiently
C: SWOOP
D: Good part, Kup! Tell Swoop good part!
E: beating wings rapidly, excitedly

D: Good part...tell
E: excitedly beating tail on Unh unh unh.... floor
N: ...tell...
C: KUP
D: Okay, Okay. The dust was really thick and then this gigantic Ick Yak...
N: ON HOT ROD He is practicing sparring with a SPINNING AUTO-COMBATANT - a very high tech quintain with many arms, legs, and weapons that test the user's skills, and reflexes. Hot Rod wears sparring gauntlet, and holds a small LASER DAGGER and special shield. As he lowers shield and reacts to Dinobot reactions to Kup's story.
C: HOT ROD
D: Don't you think we have better things to do now than tell stories Kup?
C: KUP
D: Like what?
C: HOT ROD
D: Like maybe figure out how we're gonna stay alive.
C: DINOBOTS
D: As he is speaking, Auto-Combatant "sees" its opening and gives Hot Rod a swift kick in the rear, sending him flying
E: ALL SHUSH HIM o.s.
N: THE AUTO COMBATANT Then hammers its fists on top of his head... ON HOT ROD Irked.
C: HOT ROD
D: Time out, for Cybertron's sake!
E: continuing
N: ON AUTO-COMBATANT'S FACE as it sticks out a metal tongue and gives him a LOUD RASPBERRY BACK TO SCENE as Hot Rod rises and draws his fist back to clobber the Auto- Combatant
C: AUTO COMBATANT
D: Time out, time out, time out! Suddenly, the shuttle rocks from impact and SPARKS and flames shoot out of large hole in wall
E: mechanically, quickly
N: ON ULTRA MAGNUS AT CONSOLE INTERCOM
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Kup! Raise your force fields at once! They're armed with.....
N: ON GALVATRON ON "BRIDGE" OF FLAT TOP as he presses firing button ...
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Moleculon Missiles!
E: V.O.
N: ANGLE ON GALVATRON'S CARRIER Particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out. ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE It zooms towards a whopper of a planet, surrounded by several small moons. We will later learn that this planet is Quintesson, but for now, it's mysterious. The moleculon missiles streak after it like sidewinders.
S: INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE
N: Kup and Hot Rod pilot the thing for all it's worth.
C: HOT ROD
D: They're closing on us!
C: KUP
D: Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon!
C: HOT ROD
D: Yeah, how'd you beat them?
C: KUP
D: I'm trying to remember...there were an awful lot of casualties that day...
N: ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE AND MISSILES The missiles streak toward them.
C: KUP
D: Oh yeah, we inversed polarities.
E: O.S.
C: HOT ROD
D: That'll tear the ship apart!
E: O.S.
C: KUP
D: You got a better idea?!! With that, the ship seems to stop, on a dime, in mid air! The missiles zoom past it.
E: O.S.
S: INT. THE SHIP (KUP AND HOT ROD)
N: Hot Rod watches wide-eyed, as Kup watches ahead warily, hands on the controls.
C: HOT ROD
D: Okay, so you were right.
C: KUP
D: Don't run your programs until they're debugged.
N: ANGLE OUT THE VIEWSCREEN Suddenly, the moleculon missiles, reverse course and start coming back.
C: HOT ROD
D: They're coming back.
C: KUP
D: Let's just hope we've screwed up their trajectories.
N: ANGLE ON THE MISSILES The missiles sidewind towards them, then their paths cross and BOOOM! Everything flashes white. ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE
C: HOT ROD
D: Whew!!!
S: INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE
N: Kup and Hot Rod look forward, their eyes, blinking, as if strained.
C: KUP
D: Yep, I thought we'd had it that time for sure.
S: EXT. ANGLE ON THE SHIP
N: It sits next to a gigantic alien-made moon. Suddenly, a hatch opens and a massive grabber that looks like a lobster claw shoots out at it. ANGLE ON HOT ROD He sees the claw coming out of the viewscreen.
C: HOT ROD
D: Dive!
N: ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN The claw snaps on the front of the ship, smashing the window and...
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: crushing the area between Hot Rod and Kup.
N: SPACE - ANGLE ON THE SHIP As it explodes, flinging the Autobots inside down toward the Quintesson's planet.
T: CUT TO:
N: GALVATRON PURSUING ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE - ULTRA MAGNUS, SPRINGER
N: as they man control panel in cockpit. In the background, Blurr and Arcee work to patch other holes in hull and Daniel helps them. Perceptor slowly plots coordinates on light-up table, oblivious to SHAKES AND ROCKINGS of their ship.
C: SPRINGER
D: Kup and Hot Rod just bought it!
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: I can't deal with that now.
C: SPRINGER
D: Face it, Magnus, the Decepticons 're gonna dog us until they see us dead! Ultra Magnus nods solemnly
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Then that's exactly what they're gonna see.
E: cryptic
T: CUT TO:
N: THE DECEPTICON FLAT TOP AND CYCLONUS' ARMADA
C: ON GALVATRON
D: as he works controls which eject more Moleculon Missiles.
N: HIS P.O.V. - ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE electrical outline envelopes it and there is a... ... blinding flash after which... .. remnants of the hull and superstructure explode toward camera and past camera accompanied by explosive sound and then, silence! ... Where the shuttle had been there is now...nothing! Just loose asteroids and clouds of space dust
C: CYCLONUS
D: The Autobots have been terminated!
C: GALVATRON
D: Excellent. And soon we shall say the same of that infernal Unicron. Suddenly, Galvatron's body begins to twist, and he writhes in pain.
C: GALVATRON
D: Aaaah! Take me to Unicron...Aaaah!
E: CONT
N: LONG SHOT ON THE HUGE FLAT TOP as it veers off and away from the space cloud, followed by Cyclonus' Armada. Hold for a beat, and then CLOSE IN on the dust cloud as... ... part of Ultra Magnus' shuttle flies into the clear. ANGLE ON THE COCKPIT Arcee, Perceptor, Springer, Blurr are crowded together in cramped remnant of cockpit as Daniel and Ultra Magnus sit at the control deck
C: ARCEE
D: Did we have to detonate three- quarters of the ship?!
C: SPRINGER
D: Seeing how they would have detonated four quarters, I think it was a good choice. SUDDEN SHUDDER AND THE SHIP DROPS SHARPLY, all holding on to each other and to any protruding handhold
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Perceptor....can you still locate the Junk Planet?
C: PERCEPTOR
D: Gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities, however.....
E: looks at Ultra Magnus
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Holds his head in his hands as Springer grimaces
N: RESUME ON PERCEPTOR realizes he's overdoing it again, clears his throat
C: PERCEPTOR
D: Ahem.....yes I think I can.
N: LONG SHOT- SHUTTLE CHANGING COURSE TOWARD LARGE DISTANT PLANET which we see as dim shadow on the edge of space
T: CUT TO:
N: A small, falling object appears high above Quintesson and hurtles down, down, over and over until it is in view and we see it is...
C: HOT ROD
D: still cartwheeling down toward the planet below, trying to change the angle of his fall
N: HOT ROD - TRACKING He plummets down through layers of atmosphere and continues to fall past shiny rock pinnacles of unusual construction as we CHANGE ANGLES TO AERIAL VIEW OVER A VAST SEA OF LIQUID ENERGY as Hot Rod falls into the sea, we CUT TO THE SILVERY ENERGY SEA Hot Rod sinks to the bottom where he collides with... ... a metallic reef, bounces, manages to right himself, shaking his head as he regains equilibrium, and... Then he transforms into auto mode modified for undersea action and starts riding off as he calls through intercom.
C: HOT ROD
D: Kup....Grimlock? Slag!....Anybody? WE FOLLOW him through undersea world as he rounds a "corner" of the Reef Wall and reacts
E: bubbling, filtered voice
N: HIS P.O.V. - A HUGE, MECHANICAL 0 SQUID CREATURE The ROBOTOID SQUID is tearing Kup to pieces and tossing the pieces across the ocean floor with its silvery metal tentacles ON HOT ROD
C: HOT ROD
D: Kup!
N: He transforms and blasts...
C: THE SQUID
D: angrily streaks toward Hot Rod.
C: HOT ROD
D: Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of tentacles, but the squid keeps coming...
N: ... Wraps his tentacles around Hot Rod and starts crushing... ... Hot Rod looks like he's about to be crushed, but he... ... Shoots ... Its hideous Optical Sensor.
C: THE SQUID
D: releases a laser print ink stream which boils out in the water in a series of dots and "x" shapes and retreats.
C: HOT ROD
D: Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.
C: HOT ROD
D: lowers his head and blows blast of air through head-piece. The air blast clears the water, revealing Kup's head and torso half buried in the "sand"
N: ON HOT ROD AND KUP'S HEAD as hot Rod kneels
C: HOT ROD
D: Kup! Say something!
N: CLOSE ON KUP'S HEAD as he turns head around to look up at Hot Rod and spits out a mouthful of sand
C: KUP
D: Fix me!
E: bubbling as he speaks
C: HOT ROD
D: Sure, Kup....right away! Hot Rod rapidly PULLS KUP'S SCATTERED BODY PARTS TOGETHER.
T: CUT TO:
N: KUP AND HOT ROD ON THE RED DESERT SHORE OF THE ENERGY SEA Kup stands impatiently while Hot Rod reassembles them.
C: HOT ROD
D: Well...what do you think? Kup feels his elbow joint, twists his neck side to side and gets creaks and squeaks and moves legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying himself out.
C: KUP
D: There's a piece missing.
E: a beat, then grimaces
C: HOT ROD
D: No way.... See, this wasn't yours...it's some kind of prehistoric ion cruncher....and this doohickey looks like a funky energon funnel... and this...
E: sifts through pile of SCRAP METAL PARTS lying at Kup's feet
C: KUP
D: (moving up and back, bending arms and hands, CREAKING,
C: CLUNKING, SQUEAKING)
D: Well, I still think I'm short a part! But all things considered, you did an amazing job, lad! Amazing!
E: sees Hot Rod hang his head
C: HOT ROD
D: Really?
E: brightening
C: KUP
D: Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on my rotator! Now, let's find the Dinos and get off this twisted planet!
E: rotates arm rapidly
C: ON KUP
D: as he transforms it's evident that a fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides unevenly with much chugging and oil spewing
C: KUP
D: Of all the circuit glitched diode blowin' dim-wittery... I told you a part was missin'.
E: V.O. in vehicular mode
N: we watch Hot Rod and Kup move off into the distance as we:
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: ANOTHER PART OF QUINTESSON Kup and Hot Rod walk along a swampy, marshy area. Suddenly, there are several loud gurgles, and we can see the shapes of something terrible emerging through the muck. Hot Rod spins to fire, but Kup bats down his arm. PAN TO SHOW EIGHT SHARKTICONS (in humanoid mode) surrounding them. The Sharkticons are smaller than the Autobots, but they look ugly and vicious.
C: KUP
D: Don't act hostile. I'll use the universal greeting.
C: HOT ROD
D: Universal Greeting.
C: KUP
D: Watch. I'll have them eating out of my hand.
C: HOT ROD
D: Or our faces.
N: Kup holds out his hands to show that he has no weapon. Then, he addresses them...
C: KUP
D: Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...
C: HOT ROD
D: Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong... The Sharkticons look interested.
E: mocking, mimicking
N: SHARKTICONS (GROWL VERSION OF THE SAME THING)
C: KUP
D: See, the Universal Greeting works every time. Now, without making any sudden moves, give them an Energon goody. Kup reaches into his belt, presses a button and pulls out an Energon cube. Hot Rod, somewhat suspicious of the whole process does the came.
E: pause
N: They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat. Then, the other six show up looking for cubes.
C: HOT ROD
D: This is getting expensive.
C: KUP
D: Don't worry, they'll reciprocate. They each hand out three Energon goodies to the remaining six Sharkticons... The Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they back off, eyeing the two Autobots with menace.
C: HOT ROD
D: I thought they were supposed to reciprocate.
C: KUP
D: Customs vary from place to place. Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them.
E: not sure of himself
N: The two robots, taken by surprise, fall backwards. PAN FROM the fallen robots to an area behind a tree. For just a moment, we see a small yellow Autobot in robot mode. There, then, as quickly as we realize what it is, it transforms into automode and vanishes in a flash. It was Wheelie. THE SHARKTICON CAMP ON QUINTESSON - KUP, HOT ROD AND SHARKTICONS Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a HOLDING PEN within a walled compound. As we FOLLOW THEM INTO PEN we PULL BACK and PAN to establish that entry procession is being watched by...
C: THE QUINTESSONS
D: slender, spindly framed robotic creatures with oversized five sided heads, each side bearing a different mechanistic face with a different expression on each - smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh, dissonant, metallic and terrifying music plays, underscoring the brutal evil they face,
C: KUP
D: Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on Golgonath Seven....
E: V.O.
C: HOT ROD
D: Every place reminds you of some place else.....
C: KUP
D: Experience, lad. You should learn to appreciate it.
E: V.O.
C: HOT ROD
D: A lot of good it's done us so far!
N: ON HOT ROD AND KUP as Hot Rod looks around and reacts sharply HIS P.O.V.- THE QUINTESSONS as we feature the Leader Quintesson who is taller and wears a different color robe from others. He is watching arrival of Kup and Hot Rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling face to suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace. RESUME ON HOT ROD AND KUP as Sharkticons shove and prod them, JOLTING them into the holding pen and locking the gate. Then, they install RESTRAINING BOLTS.
C: HOT ROD
D: I can't transform!
C: KUP
D: They're restraining bolts, lad.
C: HOT ROD
D: We got to get a new travel agent.... What is this place?
E: looking around
N: PAN FROM HIS P.O.V. - A SHADOWED, ALCOVE LIKE HUT as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh, bass'o voice. It is GRANIX. We saw him in the first scene, escaping from his planet when Unicron ate it. {Note: The script says *G*ranix here. Not my mistake.}
C: KRANIX
D: The world of the savage Sharkticons and their cruel masters the Quintessons. They hunt down those who try to escape the wrath of Unicron, and put them on trial.
C: KUP
D: But what if they're innocent?
C: KRANIX
D: Guilty or innocent, the sentence is always the same - death!
C: HOT ROD
D: Unicron?! Who's Unicron?
C: KRANIX
D: A planet six times the size of this one that absorbs everything in its path.
C: KUP
D: So that's the monster's name.
C: HOT ROD
D: I wonder if there's any connection between it and Galvatron.
N: Suddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in...
C: QUINTESSON GUARD
D: That one!
E: V.O.
N: All turn and look off, reacting as two Guards thunder in, grab Granix and pull him back out of the door. {NOTE: Another instance of the spelling of Granix} ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE LEAD QUINTESSON as he points at Kup and Hot Rod
C: QUINTESSON GUARD
D: Soon, you too shall receive your sentence.
N: THEIR POV - OUT THE WINDOW THE ARENA Kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board over a watery (or oily) pit teeming with Sharkticons.
C: LEAD QUINTESSON
D: Jury, have you reached a verdict?
N: JUROR #1 We have your honor.
C: LEAD QUINTESSON
D: Guilty.....Or innocent. I repeat.
E: to jury of Quintessons
C: KRANIX
D: Spare me this mockery of justice.
C: LEAD QUINTESSON
D: I repeat, guilty...or innocent.
C: JURORS
D: Guilty!!
N: Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a DEATH'S HEAD ON GRANIX {NOTE: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy. In moments, he is no more. ANGLE ON KUP He watches grimly through the bars.
C: KUP
D: Not the end I'd wish for, lad.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE EDGE OF A HUGE, SHADOWY PLANET IN SPACE as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is BUFFETED BY WINDS AND STORMS as it enters the atmosphere of JUNKION.
S: INT. THE SHUTTLE
N: as it SHAKES AND RATTLES VIOLENTLY
C: DANIEL
D: Where are we, Springer?
C: SPRINGER
D: The place where everything ends up after you throw it out.
N: TIGHT ON BLURR as he holds up hands and CROSSES fingers. RESUME ON SPRINGER Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as we see mountains of junk whizz past the window.
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: Brace for impact!
N: ON SHUTTLE - TRACKING It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk, narrowly avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk pinnacles or sides of junk walls, and causing avalanches of junk. By the time the ship lands, it is nearly indistinguishable from the junk.
S: INT. THE SHUTTLE
N: Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr, Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway, Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body sticking through the hull
C: SPRINGER
D: Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise... Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders
E: pulling himself free of hull wall
C: DANIEL
D: Wow! That was better'n the Roller Coaster at Future World!
C: PERCEPTOR
D: The composition of this planet seems to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non-ferrous articulations.
E: working scanner, computer device, thoughtfully
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: How's that?
E: baffled
C: SPRINGER
D: (opening hull door with a
C: RIPPING OF METAL)
D: He says the planet's made of junk.
N: SPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR as they look out on landscape of "living" junk
C: SPRINGER
D: Yep, this dump is a dump......
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: as he straps on TOOL BELT
C: ULTRA MAGNUS
D: We might be able to salvage this thing. Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans as Daniel moves out to join them
E: checks LASER DRILL, turns it on, off
C: DANIEL
D: Can I help, too?
C: SPRINGER
D: It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside and play with crayons or something.
C: ARCEE
D: as she steps forward with a smile, a strange GRID LIKE "SUIT" in her hand
C: ARCEE
D: I think Daniel can make himself useful with....this! It used to be Spike's.
E: holds Grid-like metal frame "suit"
C: DANIEL
D: Wow! Dad's exo-suit. He told me about it but I never saw it.
C: ARCEE
D: Here, try it on.
N: She starts helping him into the exo-suit.
C: ON DANIEL
D: as he gets inside the "suit" which fits over his body like a grid-work metal "cage."
N: Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the gridwork which makes him taller and broader. He moves awkwardly, barely able to advance a step
C: SPRINGER
D: Just think about what you want to do before you do it!
C: DANIEL
D: brows knitted, thinking.
C: SPRINGER
D: Don't fight it Dan-O.
N: He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways, then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces off walls... ..spinning upside down, then flips over several times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and that - amused, startled and unhurt.
C: DANIEL
D: It's kind of tricky....
E: continuing
N: He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his feet and leans way over against Arcee for support. She laughs and pats his shoulder
C: ARCEE
D: For the first time out, you were great!
N: ON SPRINGER AT DOOR as he sends down RAMP and motions to the others curtly
C: SPRINGER
D: Show time's over! We've got work to do!
E: he starts out
S: EXT. THE SHUTTLE
N: as Springer, Arcee, Daniel et.al. come down the ramp and look around at the lush "vegetation" of growing junk clumps all around them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of weathered junk-rock.
C: DANIEL
D: This must be the junk capital of the universe!
E: V.O. whistles
N: LONG SHOT- DANIEL AND THE OTHERS as they start DIGGING for parts to repair the ship, sinister Junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them. Their leader, WRECK-GAR, speaks to his fellow Junkions.
C: WRECK-GAR
D: Stop thief! No welcome-wagon, "hello stranger!" that good coffee flavor
E: in guttural, rusty, metallic rumble
C: OTHER JUNKIONS
D: Yeah, or your money back! Wreck-Gar shows large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor sharp fins and rusty little rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer like barrel
C: WRECK-GAR
D: Operators are standing by! They laugh in guttural, clanking sounds and look out at Springer and the others who keep working as we
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE GATE TO THE QUINTESSON PALACE
N: At first, we see only the face of a sinister Quintesson gatekeeper, backed up by heavily armed Sharkticons.
C: QUINTESSON
D: Greetings, noble strangers.
N: ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at your door wondering if you can come out and play, than like serious robots on a serious mission.
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock search for friends.
N: ANGLE ON QUINTESSON AND GRIMLOCK The Quintesson, showing his friendly face, smiles.
C: QUINTESSON
D: And who might they be?
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Autobots. Hot Rod and Kup.
C: QUINTESSON
D: Oh yes. A young one and an old one.
E: feigning recognition
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Yes. You know friends. Where are they?
C: QUINTESSON
D: They went down that path. He points to...
C: A PATH
D: It probably isn't lined with primroses, but it should be.
C: GRIMLOCK
D: GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock. I reward you, sometime.
N: With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose path." ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile.
S: EXT. UNICRON
N: Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely contorted position.
C: GALVATRON
D: Why do you torture me?!
N: VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but this place sure is spooky.
C: UNICRON
D: You have failed.
C: GALVATRON
D: No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead.
C: UNICRON
D: Then where is the matrix?
C: GALVATRON
D: Destroyed, with him.
C: UNICRON
D: The matrix can not be destroyed. And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And bring the matrix to me.
E: pause
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. THE PRIMROSE PATH
N: They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister things start to happen all around them. ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap," and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up. Swoop walks past it in humanoid mode. SNAP! It misses him by an inch.
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup close! Get thump, thump, thump...
E: taps his head hard
N: ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag revealing a spiked pit...
C: SLAG
D: Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony. He is just about to fall in when...
N: ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him away an instant before he steps into the hole...
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium salami! Slag gets up...
C: SLAG
D: Beryllium balony!
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Argh!
N: ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground, between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns and sees the thing stocking in the ground.
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap model.
C: SLAG
D: Like your head! Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s.
E: laughs at own joke
C: SQUEAKY VOICE
D: Friends find. Look behind.
E: WHEELIE
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Who say that?
E: furious
N: HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed, killing everybody else in his party. He wears a necklace of Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing, especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts into the clear... ... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto... ... Slag's head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock
C: WHEELIE
D: Friends find. Look behind. Many Face lie. You fool! You buy!
N: GRIMLOCK AND WHEELIE
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me, Grimlock, "fool?"
E: eyes blaze, furious

C: GRIMLOCK
D: Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he's a second stringer, and scampers away.
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of them, while...

C: THE CHASE
D: The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other Sharkticons, are going to catch them.

That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver. They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock, war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense. "Slice 'em dice 'em... And that's all folks or your money back..."

ANGLE ON UNICRON He looks down on the swarm of fighters and... ...Breathes fire down on them. The fighters POP and burn like popcorn in a blowtorch. In moments they disappear like sparks from a fire. ANGLE ON CYBERTRON Decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as... ... Unicron's huge hand reaches down... ... scraping buildings and... ... tearing out gun emplacements.

N: LONG SHOT- HOT ROD'S CRUISER AND THE JUNKION SPACE SHIP as hatches open and the Dinobots start FLYING OUT.
S: INT. - CRUISER
N: Hot Rod shoves joystick forward and Cruiser DRIVES TOWARD UNICRON whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass canopy ON JUNKION SPACE SHIP as it pulls up beside Hot Rod's Cruiser so they are both in a line.....The Dinobots behind both ships ...all diving toward Unicron's nose
S: INT. JUNKION SHIP - WRECK-GAR AT CONTROLS
N: As Wreck-Gar also has joystick shoved down and watches Unicron's face loom closer, closer, closer LONG SHOT- CRUISER, JUNKION SHIP AND DINOBOTS IN FORMATION as Unicron smiles and cups both hands together, preparing to catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach
C: UNICRON'S CHEST
D: Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up at... ... A bright panel on Unicron's chest...
N: BLAAAM! He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the gigantic robot to flicker momentarily. ANGLE ON UNICRON The monster lets out a ROAR! Then, reaches down, picks up Galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin. ANGLE ON GALVATRON He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly avoiding both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing teeth.
S: EXT. THE SPACE BATTLE - SAME TIME
N: As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst of fire... ... Flames lick the ship, but when the fire subsides, nothing has happened.
C: WRECK-GAR
D: Patented enamel resists fire, rain and corrosion. Five year warranty, satisfaction guaranteed.
E: V.O.
C: OTHER JUNKIONS
D: Or your money back!
N: The ship fires back, dumping rays into... ... Unicron's face, but not really doing any damage. UNICRON AND JUNKION CRUISER Unicron grabs the Junkion cruiser with both of it's hands and...
C: CLOSER
D: ... tears it in half.
C: WRECK-GAR
D: Unshakable, unbreakable, unbeatable. And for a limited time we include...

C: PERCEPTOR
D: Most unscientific, but... effective.
E: V.O.
S: EXT THE SPACE BATTLE
N: As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face.
C: THE CRUISER
D: Is suddenly struck by a ray from Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked off.
S: INT THE CRUISER
N: Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys. ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN They are heading right to Unicron's eye. ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses. The Cruiser crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew!
C: UNICRON
D: Graaaaaaaaaaa!
E: V.O.
S: INT. UNICRON'S HEAD - SAME TIME
N: The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's brain. ANGLE ON THE SHIP As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates. ANGLE ON HOT ROD He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we can assume is a robotic sinus or something)
S: EXT. THE BRAIN AREA
N: Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor in the giant, flickering chamber.
C: DANIEL
D: Where's Hot Rod?
C: SPRINGER
D: Sees something in the distance.
C: SPRINGER
D: I don't know, but I hope they didn't get him.
N: WHAT HE SEES Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the Autobots. ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS
C: KUP
D: Debugoids!
C: ARCEE
D: Quick! This way.
N: They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the central nervous system or something.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANOTHER CHAMBER - LATER
N: Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of miscellaneous junk. ON HOT ROD He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber. WHAT HE SEES Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk, until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix apparently suspended in mid air.
C: HOT ROD
D: The Autobot Matrix!
N: Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron.
C: GALVATRON
D: It will do you no good, Autobot. It cannot be opened.
N: ON HOT ROD He stands up and walks towards Galvatron.
C: HOT ROD
D: Not by a Decepticon.
N: ANGLE ON HOT ROD AND GALVATRON Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron.
C: GALVATRON
D: It is strange that we should find ourselves as allies...
C: ON GALVATRON
D: Suddenly, his body is violently twisted, and his arms are almost broken off.
C: GALVATRON
D: Uhhhh...
C: UNICRON
D: Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from limb to limb.
C: GALVATRON
D: Of course, my master!
N: ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod. ... Hot Rod dives away, as electricity seems to flash everywhere.
C: ON GALVATRON
D: He peers into the gloom.
N: GALVATRON'S POV - PANNING THE ROOM Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk.
C: ON GALVATRON
D: Weapon drawn.
C: GALVATRON
D: Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's courage. There is no response.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE
C: ASSORTED SHOTS
D: Unicron now stands atop Cybertron, fighting the various ships that swarm around him like bees. ... Rays streak from his one good eye. ...
E: MORE
C: ASSORTED SHOTS
D: His hands smash fighters... ... Fire shoots from his mouth.
E: CONT'D
C: THE DINOBOTS
D: Now reaching Unicron's butt, start kicking.
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me Grimlock kick Butt.
N: ANGLE ON UNICRON Suddenly; he looks down, sending down a searing blast of fire. ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS They transform to robot mode and fly away.
C: GRIMLOCK
D: Me, Grimlock, need new strategy.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE CORRIDOR IN UNICRON -- SAME TIME
N: Kup, Arcee, Springer and Daniel dash down the corridor. Suddenly, Daniel's foot is caught in a maze of wiring. ANGLE ON THE OTHERS Not noticing, they keep running. ANGLE ON DANIEL He tries to pull his foot out. No luck. Then, he looks up. WHAT HE SEES The Robotic Antibodies are drawing very close to him.
C: DANIEL
D: He looks o.s. towards the others.
C: DANIEL
D: Help...
N: ANGLE ON KUP AND ARCEE They turn around and see Daniel about to be munched by the antibodies.
C: ARCEE
D: Daniel!
N: ANGLE ON SPRINGER, KUP AND ARCEE They dash down the corridor firing on... THE ROBOTIC ANTIBODIES Their shots hit some, knocking them to scrap, but there are so many of them, that they can't hold back the tide as it... ANGLE UNDER THE ANTIBODIES Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head, munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free.
C: DANIEL
D: I'm okay. They don't even see me.
N: ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS It looks like Custer's last stand as they are surrounded by the vicious antibodies.
C: KUP
D: They must not programmed to catch flesh creatures.
C: SPRINGER
D: Us, on the other hand...
C: ARCEE
D: Daniel... Try to find help! Arcee fires...
N: HER SHOT - TRACKING Misses the Antibodies, but strikes a large tube. ANGLE ON THE TUBE When it is hit, it pours a torrent of liquid which... ... Goes over the swarm of Antibodies, but hits Daniel... ... Carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid. ON DANIEL - TRACKING He shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. UNICRON - A FLOWING TUNNEL
N: Daniel rips through what seem to be endless caves on the torrent of liquid, until he is dumped down a high waterfall into... .... A glowing lake. ... He stays under for a moment, and then bobs up to see...
C: UNICRON'S STOMACH
D: This is the central processing area for Unicron's "food" and "energy." A long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear, bubbling vat, where it is separated into raw material and energy. The energy, which comes out in raw form, goes into a machine and is crunched into energon cubes, while the solid material, is separated into it's component metals and plastics, formed into ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.
C: DANIEL
D: watches this with awe until he sees...
N: ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE ... Several Decepticon troopers hanging from cables like shirts at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat, and in moments converted to nothing... ... Then, Cliffjumper and Jazz roll out of the line...
C: ON DANIEL
D: He dashes to the shores of the glowing lake...
C: DANIEL
D: Cliffjumper! Jazz!
N: And then Spike comes rolling down, followed by Bumblebee!
C: DANIEL
D: Bumblebee! Dad!
N: ON CLIFFJUMPER, JAZZ, AND SPIKE They look down, but can't move because they are held by massive pincers.
C: SPIKE
D: Shut off the control, Daniel. Daniel looks around.
N: Then, he sees.
C: A CONTROL
D: .. which controls the whole thing.
C: ON DANIEL
D: He runs up a catwalk towards it....
N: ANGLE ON DANIEL He reaches the flickering panel.
C: DANIEL
D: What do I do? It doesn't have any buttons or anything.
N: ANGLE ON SPIKE - TRACKING He looks down.
C: SPIKE
D: Shoot it, Son.
C: DANIEL
D: But I don't have a gun.
C: SPIKE
D: Use your exo-suit.
N: ANGLE ON DANIEL He looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can. Then, a spark comes out. It grows longer. ANGLE ON THE MACHINE Spike and the Autobots are about to go in.
C: CLIFFJUMPER
D: Hurry!
C: DANIEL
D: Starts frying the command console!
N: ANGLE ON THE LINE It keeps moving. Then, Cliffjumper is dropped in! ANGLE ON DANIEL He looks back, and to his horror sees Jazz, Bumblebee and his father about to be dropped in. He keeps firing. The panel starts exploding!
C: DANIEL
D: I can't stop it!
N: ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE Jazz drops in, then Bumblebee, then Spike.
C: DANIEL
D: turns around and sees this.
C: DANIEL
D: Dad!
N: There is no answer. Play the moment. Then...
C: SPIKE
D: Son.
N: ANGLE ON THE VAT It is empty. The Autobots and Spike sit at the bottom, smoking but alright.
C: SPIKE
D: You did it!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE DARK CAVERN WITH GALVATRON AND HOT ROD
N: Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room. Looking everywhere for Hot Rod.
C: GALVATRON
D: Come out, Autobot. We all must die sometime.
N: Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and grabs Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face.
C: GALVATRON
D: stumbles backward.
N: ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD Galvatron jumps at Hot Rod... ... Hot Rod transforms to a car and races away... ANGLE ON GALVATRON He transforms to cannon mode and fires... ... Hot Rod transforms to humanoid mode and the shot goes through his legs. ... Then, he fires back at Galvatron... ... Hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and angering him. .Raises his gun, then lowers it.
C: GALVATRON
D: No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot Rod transforms back to car and tries to race away... ... Galvatron jumps after him and catches him... ... Hot Rod, nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to humanoid mode.
N: ... Galvatron wrestles him to his back.. ... The Adolescent Robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger. ... Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts squeezing. ... We hear the crunching of metal.
C: GALVATRON
D: First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily or I might have a sense of satisfaction now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls at Galvatron's hands...
S: EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE
N: Unicron shoots down more Decepticons with his remaining eye, while he crushes the Junkion ship.
S: INT. THE JUNKION SHIP
N: The walls crush in. The Junkions and the Autobots are being smashed together.

C: OPTIMUS PRIME
D: Arise, Rodimus Prime.
C: HOT ROD
D: Optimus!
N: ANGLE ON GALVATRON He fires at Hot Rod as...
C: GALVATRON
D: Nooooooo!
N: ... Hot Rod gets up. ... The shot doesn't even dent him.
C: HOT ROD
D: This is the end of the road, Galvatron. With that, he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through...
S: EXT. UNICRON - SAME TIME
N: ... Unicron's side...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE DARK CAVERN
N: Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix. Sticks his hand in the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier. There is no shock. Then, like pulling the pin on a hand grenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb! ASSORTED SHOTS - INVASION OF THE MATRIX The matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires causing floods and generally causing havoc.
S: EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE
N: Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion ship, sending it hurtling.
S: INT. THE JUNKION SHIP
N: It tumbles through space. AUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS (THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION) ANGLE ON UNICRON Suddenly, he starts tearing into his body.
S: EXT. SPACE
N: Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off a leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE CORRIDOR WHERE KUP ET.AL ARE TRAPPED
N: They are overrun by the antibodies. One takes a whopper bite out of Springer's chest.
C: SPRINGER
D: I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above
N: HIM. Then another explodes, then another. SPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and through the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel, Cliffjumper and Jazz. ANGLE ON THE BATTLE The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.
C: SPRINGER
D: That's what I call the nick of time.
N: ANGLE ON ALL Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at things.
C: JAZZ
D: Let's burn rubber!
N: ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL They transform. The humans jump in. THE CHASE - TRACKING They race up the tunnel, one step ahead of Unicron's hand which shoots after them, pulling apart what we know must be pieces of his brain... Then, they reach what seems like a dead end. In fact, it is the back side of Unicron's good eye. The hand comes in after them! ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the Autobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus Prime.
C: KUP
D: I knew you had potential, lad!
N: ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME
C: RODIMUS PRIME
D: Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots also transform. Daniel and Spike jump into him. Then, in a continuous line, he shoots off, the other Autobots racing behind him.
T: SMASH CUT:
S: EXT. UNICRON
N: Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye... Followed by the others. ANGLE ON UNICRON An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly, Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot out of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And then... BANG! We get the big visual explosion.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. SPACE - MUCH LATER
N: Unicron's head orbits Cybertron. PAN to Cybertron where and PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus, Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch construction being done on Cybertron below.
C: RODIMUS PRIME
D: Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian wars as we move forward to a new age of peace and happiness....
C: ALL
D: Until all are one!
N: THE END
