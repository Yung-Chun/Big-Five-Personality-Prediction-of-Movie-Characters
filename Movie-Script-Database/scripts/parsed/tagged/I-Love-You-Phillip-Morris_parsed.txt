E: V.O.
N: He continues to CRY uncontrollably as he raises a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and dumps all the pills into his mouth. He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a bottle of Galliano to wash it down. He starts up the car.

D: Like the fact that he was a big queer?
C: DEBBIE
D: Yeah, like that.
C: KEMPLE
D: But suicide, my god.
C: DEBBIE
D: Well he does tend to overreact.
C: KEMPLE
D: I feel like I don't even know him. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 25.
C: DEBBIE
D: Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not really sure he knows who he is. He's searching, at least that's how I figure it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is he's looking for.
C: KEMPLE
D: Can you tell me exactly what he did?
E: to cop
N: As they CONTINUE TO TALK, they fail to notice Steven getting out of bed and looking around blearily. He picks up a bedpan, reaches into his gown and absent- mindedly PISSES-- missing the pan completely.
C: COP
D: He has several warrants out in Texas. Fraud, forgery, embezzlement...
C: DEBBIE
D: What?
C: KEMPLE
D: I should have known... I should have said something.
C: DEBBIE
D: Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest.
C: KEMPLE
D: That would be a warning sign...
C: DEBBIE
D: And all that Peter Allen music on his Walkman.
C: KEMPLE
D: Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel so bad now.
C: DEBBIE
D: I just never thought. But now stealing?
C: KEMPLE
D: He's probably been doing it for years. I say to myself he did it just to buy me things but I don't think that's true. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 26.
C: DEBBIE
D: It's bigger than that. I'm sure.

N: Steven escorts Arnie through the prison, waving to various inmates and guards along the way.
C: STEVEN
D: You're gonna catch a beating any day now, that's just the way it is. I lost three teeth and cracked a vertebrae. Anyway, all you need to do is fight back. Win or lose, just fight back. Or you could try to suck the guys' dick. Your choice.
E: upbeat then
N: He moves on.

C: STEVEN
D: Law Library. I pretty much live here. I don't really have anyone on the outside except my ex-wife- so I just hunker down here learning everything there is to know about the law. Ask me anything.
N: Arnie has no response. Steven points across the library where a menacing OLDER INMATE studies a law book.
C: STEVEN
D: See him. Over there? Him? Anything you want from outside, he's the guy. Candy, cigarettes, drugs, whatever. He's the guy. Just keep in mind- it's gonna cost you a lot of money. Or you could suck his dick. Your choice.

N: Arnie notices one of the INMATES working in the kitchen SPITTING a loogey into the mashed potatoes. He mixes it in and CACKLES with glee. Steven pays no mind.

N: Steven and Arnie arrive at the doorway of their cell.

C: STEVEN
D: Do you think I broke his heart? Sorry. Sometimes I forget it's just the machine... I'll try you again next time. One O'clock. Don't forget.
E: CONT'D thinking, drifting snapping out of it
N: He hangs up. Bored and lonely, he has a moment of repose. Just then, a loud RUCKUS across the COMMON AREA gets his attention. Steven watches as a group of ROWDY PRISONERS throw whatever they can find at a small BIRD as it flies around, trapped in the cavernous hall. The men LAUGH and HOOT as the bird is struck down and lies motionless on the ground. As the prisoners resume their activities, Steven notices a GENTLE LOOKING INMATE approaching the bird. Rapt, Steven watches as the inmate sympathetically scoops up the bird and walks off. Steven is quite taken.

D: I'm sorry.
C: STEVEN
D: Don't be sorry. It's just across the yard.
C: PHILLIP
D: Well I don't go into that yard so it might as well be Oklahoma. Just figures with my luck. I was born Friday the 13th...
E: then
C: STEVEN
D: It's not gonna change a thing, Phillip. In fact, Friday the 13th's my lucky day. Don't worry, this right here. This is destiny.

C: STEVEN
D: Don't you touch him!
C: PHILLIP
D: Steven-
C: STEVEN
D: Don't worry Phillip- I'll-
C: GUARD
D: Shut up and move.
N: They drag him off. Phillip watches with deep worry as another guard keeps him there. He grows more and more upset, pacing and working himself up. Finally, the guard leaves and Phillip exits his cell and bolts down the tier after Steven.

C: STEVEN
D: We gotta get a bigger place.
C: PHILLIP
D: Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor- Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest.
C: EUDORA
D: Pleasure Steven.
C: STEVEN
D: Eudora...
C: PHILLIP
D: Eudora owns a little building in Montrose and she's having a hell of time with the builder. He sounds like a real asshole.
C: EUDORA
D: His plans were useless and he's trying to sue me to pay him! I need your expertise Steven. Phillip says maybe you can help.
C: STEVEN
D: I could certainly try.
C: EUDORA
D: Can you still practice law, having been to prison?
C: STEVEN
D: Sure- why not?
C: EUDORA
D: I just thought- Oh what do I know? I'd just be glad to have someone I could trust. I'll pay your normal fee.
N: Steven doesn't miss a beat. He smiles wide.
C: STEVEN
D: It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my speciality.

S: INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM, 1995 - DAY
N: STEVEN'S POV: A beautifully ornate courthouse LIGHT FIXTURE hangs from a courthouse ceiling. ON STEVEN, staring up at it with admiration.
C: JUDGE
D: Mister Russell?
E: O.S.
N: Steven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting JUDGE.
C: STEVEN
D: It's a beautiful fixture.
C: JUDGE
D: I know. It's your turn.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh... Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed.
E: then
C: LAWYER
D: The terms of that contract were ambiguous at best. The truth is, defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment.
C: STEVEN
D: Your honor I have, in my briefcase, fourteen other contracts, all on public record, in which Mr. Evans entered into litigation with past clients of his!
N: Eudora glances into Steven's opened BRIEFCASE. It contains only a SANDWICH and a PHOTO OF PHILLIP. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 54. The shocked LAWYER turns to his client (EVANS).
C: LAWYER
D: Is this true?
E: whispers
C: EVANS
D: No.
C: LAWYER
D: You're making me look like an idiot.
N: He regroups and addresses the judge.
C: LAWYER
D: Your honor, I don't have to tell you that none of this is admissable or applicable to the case at hand. Mr. Russell's histrionics do not erase the fact that his client is in breech of contract.
E: CONT'D
C: JUDGE
D: He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have to say?
N: Steven is stonewalled. He looks to Eudora as if to say, "What do I do now?" and it terrifies her. Desperate, Steven bangs his fist on the table and looks resolutely to the judge.
C: STEVEN
D: I demand to be seen in chambers!!
N: The judge and lawyer seem mystified by this response.
C: JUDGE
D: Okaaaaaaaay...
S: INT. HOUSTON JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, 1995 - DAY
N: The Lawyer sits impatiently while Steven peruses a wall of plaques, photos and diplomas. He focuses on a law school DEGREE from INDIANA COLLEGE OF LAW. Next to it, a PHOTO of the judge as a YOUNG MAN on a farm. He's from humble roots. A moment later, the Judge enters.
C: JUDGE
D: Okay gentlemen, let's get this over with, the two for one at the Crab Boiler ends at five o'clock. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 55.
C: LAWYER
D: This seems to be cut and dried here, sir. I don't even know why we're back here. Mister Russell is treating this like an episode of Matlock.
C: STEVEN
D: I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't go to Yale. My education was modest. I went to a small school. I grew up on a small farm. But I passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and I am not going to let him push around this humble woman.
N: This scores with the judge.
C: JUDGE
D: Point taken Mister Russell...
N: He glares at the other lawyer with scorn.
C: JUDGE
D: ...but where are you going with this?
E: CONT'D
C: STEVEN
D: I think it's obvious where I'm going with this sir.
N: A long SILENCE. The Judge waits and waits until something occurs to him.
C: JUDGE
D: Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?
N: Steven doesn't know what this means... But the other lawyer does. And he's not happy.
C: LAWYER
D: Shit...
E: sotto
N: Seeing this, Steven puffs with confidence.
C: STEVEN
D: Your honor, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
N: The Judge slowly nods to himself as he considers this.

D: YES! I did great! Can you believe how great I did!?
C: EUDORA
D: Yes. You did very well, Steven. Thank you.
E: wary
C: STEVEN
D: I mean, I did great! Really great! I'm so proud of myself! You want half my sandwich?!
C: EUDORA
D: Um...

D: No! We're going out! I'm paying!!

N: Phillip stands flabbergasted next to Steven in the middle of a large modern apartment.
C: PHILLIP
D: Oh my God, it's amazing.
C: STEVEN
D: I thought you'd like it honey.
C: PHILLIP
D: Can we afford this?
C: STEVEN
D: You let me worry about the money sweetheart.
C: PHILLIP
D: Okay, well I guess I better start packing boxes.
C: STEVEN
D: Not this weekend.
C: PHILLIP
D: Why not? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 57.
C: STEVEN
D: I think we both need a vacation. Key West?
N: Phillip smiles. I/E. KEY WEST COVE - 1996 - VARIOUS PALM TREES undulate on the constant breeze, inviting us to a beautifully solitary cove. Eventually Steven and Phillip's voices are heard.
C: PHILLIP
D: I've been meaning to ask you something.
E: O.S.
C: STEVEN
D: Yeah?
E: O.S.
N: DIALOGUE CONTINUES OVER VARIOUS SHOTS of their romantic getaway to the Keys. In a SERIES of SHOTS we see where they've been and what they've been doing in the moments AFTER they've been there. - A Hammock blowing in the breeze. - A quaint COTTAGE nestled in the vegetation. - Half empty glasses of beer on the porch. - Dirty dishes in the cottage sink. The remains of a romantic meal on a table. The swaying palms are visible through the windows. - Footsteps in the sand. - Two beach chairs facing the surf. - Etc... etc...
C: PHILLIP
D: That birthday cake you got me in the pen? Where'd you get those candles?
E: O.S.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh you know... just... people I knew.
E: O.S.
C: PHILLIP
D: Yeah, I know. But how? "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 58.
E: O.S.
C: STEVEN
D: Remember that guard? Skinny guy? Smoked a lot?
E: O.S.
C: PHILLIP
D: Lance? He couldn't been more than 98 pounds.
E: O.S.
C: STEVEN
D: Yeah, that's him.
E: O.S.
C: PHILLIP
D: Oh he was such an asshole.
E: O.S.
C: STEVEN
D: Actually- I was in the yard once. Another guard asked him to pay him back five. He opened his wallet and I saw this picture of a little girl about Steffie's age. So I brought it up to him once, just to get him talking. That's the thing about having kids, you know? Gets people talking. Shared experience. Builds bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he tells me he's worried about her- mamma was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That's all. I brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened... And the next day, bedtime, there they were.
E: O.S.
S: 91A EXT. PALM BEACH COVE - 1996 - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 91A
N: The dialogue continues on the beach as we finally see Steven and Phillip enjoying the sunset by the light of a small fire on the beach.
C: PHILLIP
D: How'd you know he'd do that?
C: STEVEN
D: I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for you... and I found a way to do it. That's all.
N: Phillip smiles, eyes never leaving the sunset.
C: PHILLIP
D: Just listenin' huh?
C: STEVEN
D: That's it... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 59.
N: And as the sun sets on the shimmering water--
S: EXT. OCEAN, 1996 - DAY
N: An empty 21-foot MOTORBOAT bobs atop placid seas, fishing poles dangling over the side. The SOUND of two men enjoying themselves can be heard. After reaching their inevitable conclusion, the VOICES gasp for air.
C: PHILLIP
D: I'm gonna get a Coke... you want a Coke?
E: O.S. winded
C: STEVEN
D: Uh huh... *
E: O.S.
N: Phillip spits something over the railing... * STEVEN (CONT'D) * Aw, you don't love me... * And as Phillip smiles and wipe his chin. *
C: STEVEN
D: With Phillip I felt strong. I felt invincible. I promised myself he would never want for anything ever again. That meant I needed a real job. Something dependable. And- no more scams.

S: INT. USAMM HQ - LINDHOLM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY
N: A bored Steven waits in the middle of a big wig's office. He looks at PHOTOS on a nearby wall of a broad-shouldered all-American man dressed in a NASA jump suit performing various astronautical training tasks. He picks up a small ASTRONAUT FIGURINE and examines it.
C: LINDHOLM
D: Sorry to keep you waiting Steven.

N: Steven turns to find Dan Lindholm, the broad-shouldered man himself.
C: LINDHOLM
D: I'm Dan Lindholm. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 60.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVEN
D: Were you a spaceman?
C: LINDHOLM
D: Yep. Never got out there though. NASA's a real political place. Never could figure out whose ass to kiss to get a mission. All in the past. Barely even think about it now...
E: then
N: CUT TO REVEAL a HUGE MODEL of the SPACE SHUTTLE that engulfs half the room. Steven puts the figurine back.
C: STEVEN
D: A spaceman, huh? How do you crap up there?
C: LINDHOLM
D: Ass gasket. Have a seat.
E: draws on his coffee
N: Steven sits across the desk from Lindholm .
C: LINDHOLM
D: With the popularity of HMO's in today's health care system, doctors need help managing their billing-- so they can focus on their patients. That's where USA Medical Management comes in. Hundreds of millions of dollars pass through our system from the HMO's to the doctors. It's a critical business. A powerful business... So when I read your resume, I wasn't sure what to think. Your level of education and your past experience would factor heavily into this decision and frankly...
E: CONT'D beat
N: Steven deflates in expectation.
C: LINDHOLM
D: ...you were head and shoulders above the rest. I mean, I could hardly believe it. But when I called your references-- well they couldn't speak more highly of you.

S: INT. NEW HOUSTON APARTMENT KITCHEN - 1996 - DAY
N: Steven makes breakfast in his tightie-whities while talking on the phone. Phillip is in the background doing a crossword puzzle at the kitchen table.
C: STEVEN
D: I could not speak more highly of Steven Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight shooter. We were damn lucky to have him at Prudential as long as we did.
N: In his own world, Phillip chimes in.
C: PHILLIP
D: Brando's wet debut?
N: Steven covers the phone with his hand.
C: STEVEN
D: On the Waterfront.
N: BACK TO:
S: INT. LINDHOLM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY
N: Dan continues to wax on about Steven.
C: LINDHOLM
D: Employee of the year two years running? Developing software with IBM? You're the kind of people we need here Steven. We want you as our Chief Financial Officer. So what do you say? I want your answer right now. C'mon Steven- let's light this candle.
N: As Steven pretends to mull--
S: INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY
N: An uptight assistant (RHEBA) leads Steven into his fancy new office.
C: RHEBA
D: ...for example "he's in a meeting" sounds better than "he's away from his desk" at least I think so, but whatever you prefer.
C: STEVEN
D: That's fine... sure. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 62.
N: She leads him to his new desk which is stacked with folders, files, printouts and reams of data.
C: RHEBA
D: I pulled all the claims for the last two years as well as the statements, transfers and confirmations from the bank. Most of it's routine and I think you can get up to speed in a day or two. Anything else I can do for you?
E: then
C: STEVEN
D: Uh.... cup of coffee?
C: RHEBA
D: I'll do it today but I don't do that really.
N: Steven nods and turns his attention to the sea of numbers before him. He looks concerned as he begins to leaf through.
S: INT. USAMM BOARDROOM - 1996 - DAY
N: Steven sits in a board meeting, surrounded by all of the company honchos. Dan Lindholm lords over the gathering at the head of the table while a suit (MARK) reads from a report to the group.
C: MARK
D: Crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in Q4 as projected... As for Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with training wheels.
N: Everyone LAUGHS, but no one quite as hard as Steven who desperately tries to fit in. Larry Birkheim, the CEO of USAMM sits beside Dan Lindholm. He chimes in.
C: BIRKHEIM
D: Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've only had the one quarter to play catch up but I tell you, we can't wait to get some insight here. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 63.
C: STEVEN
D: Sure. What about?
C: BIRKHEIM
D: Mark's projections.
C: STEVEN
D: Mmm hm. Sure.
C: BIRKHEIM
D: They seem kind of flat.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh. Okay. Ummm...
N: Steven fumbles through some folders and vamps a while.
C: STEVEN
D: Well I did a lot of work here and uh... I think maybe... well I could just read it to you but uh... it might be better to just uh...
E: CONT'D
N: The group looks at him quizzically. Just as it seems Steven has been up to nothing--
C: STEVEN

D: Okay... mmm hmm...
E: CONT'D
N: Through the glass wall outside the phone room, we watch as Steven continues to absorb the bad news. He hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the CACOPHONY of the prison masks any sound of his grief.

C: STEVEN
D: I wasn't going to lose Phillip. No way. I broke Jimmy's heart and I was not gonna break Phillip's. I was gonna make everything alright. No matter what it took, I was going to escape.
E: V.O.
N: He gives a quick look around and prepares another syringe. After another injection, he prepares another. And then ANOTHER and ANOTHER...
S: INT. HOUSTON POLICE CRUISER - 1996 - A SHORT TIME LATER
N: The DRIVING COP watches the road blankly until his nose catches a putrid scent in the air.
C: DRIVING COP
D: Fuck... what is that?

D: Grand Theft. You?
C: FIRST PRISONER
D: B and E.
N: The Second Prisoner turns to Steven...

S: INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL, HOUSTON - 1996 - LATER

S: INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY
N: Steven finishes filling the sink in his cell and pulls out a GREEN MAGIC MARKER. He breaks it open and drips the ink into the water. And as the water turns GREEN, Steven removes his white scrubs and plunges them in the sink.
S: INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL GUARD STATION - 1996 - NIGHT
N: The NIGHT GUARD watches his monitors when a rap on the glass gets his attention. He looks up to see Steven in newly (and badly) dyed GREEN SCRUBS, awaiting exit on the other side, holding the stolen ID BADGE against the glass.

N: The judge finishes filling out the form and PLACES IT AT THE EDGE OF HIS BENCH for Steven to see. It clearly reads his bail amount, his charge, everything. As the Attorney PRATTLES ON in the background, Steven just STARES AT THE FORM LONG AND HARD.

I don't even think you know who you are. So how am I supposed to love something that don't even exist? You tell me.

N: Phillip listens in devastated silence.
S: EXT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER - 1998 - DAY
N: Steven looks worse than ever in his semi-private bed, looking out the window at the clouds with a catatonic gaze. He's at peace. It is the moment of his death.

I am still angry with you, but I need you to know something. Even if sometimes I don't know who you are, I love you. I never stopped loving you. You and me are just fools for love I guess- written in the stars or some crap like that. But it was never better, never more real than with you Steven. I realize now that all that crazy shit you did- in your fucked up way- it was always for me. Always for us. You are the most amazing man Steven. It takes my breath away. And even though I can't be with you now, I will always be yours... Forever.

D: Uh- my friend in the infirmary... Uh, they got a call from that long term care place and uh, well a few days ago Steven- ...I'm so sorry Phillip.
E: CONT'D then
N: Phillip nods as it washes over him. He sends Samuel on his way with a look. Once he's alone, Phillip lets go and SOBS. He buries his face in his pillow. After a long while- CLANG. A sound gets his attention. A BOSSY GUARD stands at the door of his cell.
C: BOSSY GUARD
D: Morris. Come with me.
N: Phillip composes himself and follows the guard out.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY CORRIDOR - 1998 - DAY
N: The guard leads Phillip down the corridor. Still coming out of his mournful haze, he becomes curious. They arrive at a door marked, "MEETING ROOM 2".
C: PHILLIP
D: Where are we going?
C: BOSSY GUARD
D: Your lawyer's here.
N: He swings open the door to reveal STEVEN, alive and well and wearing a thrift store suit. Phillip is aghast, frozen. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 106.
C: STEVEN
D: Did I forget to mention I didn't die? Yeah, I didn't die. Faked the whole thing.
E: V.O.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1997 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - NIGHT
N: FLASHBACK. Steven is curled up in a ball, sobbing as he stares at a picture of Phillip pasted to the wall.
C: BUNKMATE
D: Shut the fuck up, I'm trying to sleep.
E: O.S.
C: STEVEN
D: Fuck you. I got a broken heart here.
N: We see now his Bunkmate is Cleavon.
C: CLEAVON
D: Well then do something about it mother fucker- `stead of crying like Whitney Houston looking for her crack pipe.
N: Steven takes his kind words to heart.
C: STEVEN
D: Yeah I know...
C: CLEAVON
D: Damn right. Love creates miracles motherfucker. Ain't you ever read the Bible? So get off your ass and go forth unto the Canaanites you faggot bitch.
N: Steven returns his gaze to Phillip's photo.
C: STEVEN
D: When you're right you're right Cleavon...
N: Long pause.
C: CLEAVON
D: Wanna suck me off?
C: STEVEN
D: No thanks.
C: CLEAVON
D: Well sweet dreams then. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 107.
C: STEVEN
D: Lying there in all my misery, I had a moment of clarity. It became clear to me- I had to get to Phillip. No matter what. Even if it meant dying...
E: V.O.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1997 - CAFETERIA - DAY
N: FLASHBACK. Steven sits over an untouched tray of food, staring at it detached.
C: STEVEN
D: Faking your death from AIDS is no easy task, believe me. But after watching Jimmy die, I thought I could make it convincing. First, you have to starve yourself- I ate half as much every day for ten months. After that, you have to fake all sorts of symptoms.
E: V.O.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1997 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL- NIGHT
N: FLASHBACK. Steven kneels over the toilet in his cell, sticking his finger down his throat until he pukes.
C: STEVEN
D: You gotta keep this up for months until you lose about, say, 80 pounds.
E: V.O.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - MORNING
N: FLASHBACK. Months later, Steven sits up in his bed. He now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he has lost an unhealthy amount of weight.
C: STEVEN
D: But the hardest part is falsifying your records.
E: V.O.
S: 197 INT. TX STATE PEN, 1998 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL(LAWRENCE) DAY
N: Steven enters an inmate's cell (LAWRENCE) with a BIG BAG OF COFFEE.
C: STEVEN
D: Hey Lawrence- you still work in the infirmary?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Mmm hmm... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 108.
N: Steven holds up a three pound BAG OF COFFEE.
C: STEVEN
D: You like coffee?
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - INFIRMARY OFFICE - DAY
N: Lawrence sweeps up in an empty office. He looks to see if the coast is clear and bolts for some file cabinets. After some searching, Lawrence pulls out a file entitled "Russell, Steven A". Reading from a scrap of paper, he scrawls something with a pen. Lawrence then reaches into his pants and pulls out some forged forms- stuffing them into the folder.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - INFIRMARY - DAY
N: FLASHBACK. OPEN CLOSE on the gaunt and grey-skinned Steven. A MALE NURSE places a thermometer in his mouth and looks at Phillip's medical history. CLOSE ON THE FILE- a doctor's entry reads "HIV+ since 91" A few flips of the pages reveal FORGED BLOOD TEST DOCUMENTS. Buzzwords like T-CELL COUNTS and other terms catch the Nurse's eye. He looks concerned.
C: MALE NURSE
D: I'll be right back.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - INFIRMARY EXAM ROOM - DAY
N: FLASHBACK. Steven sits before a YOUNG PRISON DOCTOR who looks through his records.

C: STEVEN
D: How long do I have?
N: And off the Doctor's grave face-- "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 109.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY
N: Steven lays in his hospital bed. A FAT NURSE puts a pill in his mouth and follows it with some water. She exits. Once she's clear, Steven reaches into his mouth and pulls out the pill. He secretly places it into a small HOLE in his mattress for safe keeping.
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY
N: FLASHBACK. Again, we are at the first hospital scene of the movie. The cardio ALARM blares. Steven watches as a DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside.
C: DOCTOR
D: Where's the crash cart!?
N: He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard. With the staff distracted, Steven reaches into his mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills. He stuffs them into his mouth as fast as he can.
C: STEVEN
D: But the hardest part by far is getting transferred to a private care facility. It's standard procedure for late stage patients, but convincing them I was about to die would involve taking a few risks.
E: V.O.
N: He chases the pills down with a glass of water.
S: EXT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY
N: Steven is helped from a corrections van into a wheelchair outside the Restful Acres facility.

C: STEVEN
D: This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin Center, Houston. I'm looking for AIDS patients for a study we're... "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 110.
N: And as he talks--
C: STEVEN
D: And once I got settled in, I just called the Department of Corrections and convinced them I was a state-sponsored doctor looking for late stage AIDS patients for an experimental treatment. As luck would have it, they had one patient that was eligible...
E: V.O. CONT'D then
N: Steven continues his Dr. Rios imitation on the phone.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh you do? Steven Russell? Could you spell that?
N: CAMERA SETTLES on a nearby CALENDAR. It reads: "MONDAY, JANUARY 5"
T: MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY
N: The calendar reads "FRIDAY, MARCH 13" An ORDERLY enters with a WHEELCHAIR.
C: ORDERLY
D: Mister Russell, the clinic sent a taxi here to pick you up.
N: I/E. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY Later that day, Steven is helped out of his wheelchair into a waiting taxi.
C: STEVEN
D: And for all that time- all those doctors, all those nurses and all those facilities... not one of them ever thought to give me an AIDS test...
E: V.O.
N: The door SLAMS and off he drives.
C: STEVEN
D: Fucking Texas...
E: V.O.
S: INT. TAXI, 1998 - DAY
N: Once clear, Steven speaks to the driver. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 111.
C: STEVEN
D: I had a special request when I ordered the cab. Did they tell you?
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Yeah- right here.
N: He lifts a GREASY BROWN BAG into view.
C: STEVEN
D: Thank God.
N: Steven grabs it and begins to gorge himself on BURGERS.
C: STEVEN
D: A week later, the hospice was to get a call from Doctor Rios, telling them Steven Russell had died undergoing treatment. And after all that hard work dying? Where's the first place I go?
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. TEXAS STATE PEN MEETING ROOM, 1998 - DAY
N: BACK TO MEETING ROOM. Phillip stands frozen before Steven
C: STEVEN
D: Funny, huh?
E: V.O.
N: The guard pushes Phillip past the threshold. The door SLAMS SHUT behind him. He staggers toward Steven as a kaleidoscope of emotions plays across his face. Bewilderment, relief, sorrow, joy and finally, anger- WHACK! He slaps Steven across the face.
C: PHILLIP
D: You're such a fucker!
C: STEVEN
D: I know- I'm sorry- You weren't supposed to find out.
C: PHILLIP
D: Well I did!
C: STEVEN
D: I couldn't take a chance telling you. You know that. I couldn't. But Phillip, I only did it so I could get here to you. Just to talk to you. And here I am. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 112.
E: then
N: Phillip tries to take this to heart. After a moment...
C: PHILLIP
D: You're so skinny.
C: STEVEN
D: I'm fine. Just hungry.
C: PHILLIP
D: Steven I don't-
C: STEVEN
D: Wait. Listen. I just came here to tell you one thing and that's it. You don't have to take me back, I just want to say one thing.
N: Phillip is listening.
C: STEVEN
D: I know you thought we were nothing but a lie- but underneath all those lies there was always something that was real. I thought about what you said to me. You said you don't know who I am. But I have to tell you- I know now. I know who I am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an escape artist. Those Steven Russells are dead. And now, all that's left is the man that loves you. That's all. Nothing else. I'm just the man that loves you. And if you can see that... believe it... then I promise I'll never be anything else ever again.
E: CONT'D then
N: A LONG, LONG SILENCE. Phillip looks to him.
C: PHILLIP
D: How do I know you're not bullshitting me again?
N: Steven pauses. He looks Phillip square in the eye.
C: STEVEN
D: You don't.
N: And as Phillip stares at him-
T: CUT TO BLACK:
N: "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 113. A long SILENCE. Then finally...
T: FADE IN:

N: At a window, a CLERK stamps a few documents and hands them to Steven, who is dressed in his lawyer attire. Steven exits the line and ducks into a nearby bathroom.
S: INT. TEXAS COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM - 1998 - DAY
N: At the urinal, Steven whistles to himself. SUPER: "Steven Russell was arrested two weeks later trying to secure Phillip's release." Steven turns his head to find the man at the next urinal staring at him. It's a very surprised Birkheim with a badge affixed to his jacket reading, "JUROR". Steven SMILES at him.
S: INT. TEXAS COURTROOM - 1999 - DAY
N: Steven sits in court while a FEMALE D.A. argues her case. SUPER: "An embarrassment to the State of Texas and Governor George Bush, Steven was given an unprecedented life sentence." She nods to the audience where Lindholm sits smiling. SUPER: "Coincidentally, the D.A. who prosecuted him was the Sister in law of Dan Lindholm- Steven's former boss"
S: INT. LOCKDOWN CELL, 1999 - NIGHT
N: Steven smiles wide, shackled in a solitary 6 by 7 cell. SUPER: "Steven sits in 23 hour-a-day lockdown, with only one hour a day for supervised showers and exercise." Steven stares at his Key West CALENDAR with a small photo of Phillip attached to it. The cell brightens, everything around Steven blooms with white light. He looks to see. "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 114.
S: EXT. OCEAN - DAY

T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: SUPER: "On average, there are 1.7 Friday the 13ths a year.
S: EXT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY - DAY
N: A SIREN BLARES over a wide of the facility. Small in frame, we see Steven running from the prison gaining ground on the two guards chasing him. THE END
