S: EXT HARLEM STREET ­ DAY
N: A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street lamp. An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on. A book bag drops onto the pavement. Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk. Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they stop abruptly. Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES. Something inside the bin has caught her attention. Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book staring back up at her is unintelligible. She pushes debris aside to get to it. The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee. The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches. Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the sounds of the oncoming car close in. Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES. The car sounds incredibly close. Precious looks sharply to her left. AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD! Precious, almost hit, falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the intersection and down into a drain. She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the street lamp with her eyes closed. The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and SCREECHES off. The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side until settling, to a stop. An ambulance eases up to the intersection. When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past Precious in no hurry. A moment later, its sirens BLARE and it speeds off into the distance. The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and turns to Precious. He licks her face. Tom Cruise walks up to her. Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. Tom gives her a hand up.

S: INT. CLASSROOM ­ DAY
N: Precious sits in the last row behind 26 children half her size, 3 years younger and mostly African American. Noise and projectiles fill the air. MR. WICHER -A FRAIL MAN IN A BOW TIE AND TWEED COAT, stands at the head of the class trying to establish order.
C: MR. WICHER
D: Class, would you please turn to page 122 ...Class! 122!
N: Precious' book stays closed as the other students find the page. TWO BOYS in front of Precious giggle boisterously at some private joke. Mr. Wicher looks annoyed but accustomed to this.

Now I'm tryin' to have a motherfuckin' conversation back here if you don't mind Mr. Bitcher, I mean, Mr. Wicher. The boys fallout slapping hands. The class turns to Mr. Wicher in unison to see what he will do.
C: MR. WICHER
D: I want to see you boys after class.
N: BOY# 2 Sorry Mr. Wicher but you ain't my type. Grow some tits.
C: MR. WICHER
D: Just be quiet.
N: Mr. Wicher tries to carry on throughout the boys' unrelenting defiance. Other students are continually distracted by the boys. Precious looks bothered the most as Mr. Wicher's soft voice loses the battle.
C: PRECIOUS
D: I feels sorry for Mr. Wicher. He do his best but he ain't got no voice. He scared too. I feels sorry for him.
E: V.O.
N: The boys break out in RIOTOUS LAUGHTER until ... CRASH! A desk slams against the floor. The boys whirl around to see two large hands take hold of them and snatch them out of their chairs. Precious has had enough.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Shut up motherfuckers, I'm trying to learn something! Hard enuff wiffout you stupid clowns carryin' on!
N: BOY# 1 (trembling) ...sorry Precious. BOY# 2 (trembling) We cool. Precious shoves them down in their seats and huffs.

N: Precious turns her desk upright and sits back down. Mr. Wicher looks grateful.
C: PRECIOUS
D: I'm like the polices for Mr. Wicher. Tha's why I can't be late to maff.
E: V.O.
N: KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Someone is outside the classroom. Mr. Wicher waves her inside. MRS. LICHENSTEIN, A SKINNY WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES WEARING A DARK SKIRT SUIT enters, squints to find Precious, points briefly and then whispers something to Mr. Wicher. Precious rolls her eyes.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Now dis ...

C: PRECIOUS
D: You gonna be okay Mr. Wicher?
C: MR. WICHER
D: Of course Precious. Thank you.
E: forcing a smile
N: An unconvinced Precious grins sadly as Mrs. Lichenstein motions for Precious to step out ahead of her. Mr. Wicher looks abandoned. The door closing behind Precious might as well be to a prison cell block. Noise inside the classroom returns immediately.

N: Precious heads down the hall without looking back. Mrs. Lichenstein's CRIES are still audible.
S: INT. PRECIOUS' APT 444 LENOX AVE. - DAY

D: You get my cigarettes?
E: O.S
N: Precious freezes. Her HEART BEATS loudly.
C: PRECIOUS
D: No Mama, I dropped some of my thangs on the way to school.
E: delicately
N: A SCREECHING CAR echoes distantly. MARY - INCREDIBLY LARGE, OILY SKIN, ILL-FITTED WIG AND HOUSE DRESS sits on the couch with her back turned to Precious. This woman looks as if she is one with the furniture. A cigarette smolders between her fingers as she watches "THE PRICE IS RIGHT" on television. Precious, still waiting for the other shoe to drop, looks momentarily relieved and returns to the dishes until ... CRACKKKK! A thick glass ashtray smashes into Precious' head. Precious falls and lands ...

S: EXT. RED CARPET - NIGHT
N: Blinding flashbulbs pop everywhere. Precious walks the red carpet with Tom Cruise. They head toward the entrance of the theatre stopping occasionally to sign autographs. Both sport matching sunglasses. The paparazzi is going wild. THUNDER RUMBLES. Precious removes her sunglasses and searches the sky. A LIGHTENING CRACK ROARS. Rain starts to fall as ...

E: O.S. at the top of her lungs
S: INT. KITCHEN 444 LENOX AVE. - DUSK
N: Eyes closed with ashes and tears on her face, Precious lays still on the floor. Her hands are still wet from the dishes. GOOOSH! 2 gallons of water splash down on her. Her eyes spring open. Mary stands over Precious with a large dripping pot in her hands. She drops it on the floor and returns to the couch to watch another program.
C: MARY
D: ...I ain' gon' say it again.
S: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
N: Pots and pans sizzle on the stove. Precious, now wearing a dry T-shirt, tends to dinner meticulously until ... ANNNNT! The sharp sound of a BUZZER rings. Mary and Precious turn to the door in unison.
C: MARY
D: Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell.
N: Here is our first good look at Mary. She wares way too much make up. Precious wipes her hands and heads for the door though Mary sits much closer to it.

S: EXT. 444 LENOX AVE. - NIGHT
N: A young man exits the building smoking a cigarette. Mrs. Lichenstein puts her hands together, dramatically pleads for a smoke and gets one. She puts it in her mouth and lights hers to his. Bouncing to stay warm, she nods in gratitude as the man walks off.
C: PRECIOUS

N: Precious leans against the refrigerator glowing.
C: PRECIOUS
D: My heart is all warm...Mr. Wicher say I'm a good student.
E: V.O.
N: There is silent movement behind Precious. Mary approaches quietly wielding a skillet. Mary swings for a head shot but Precious easily sidesteps the blow. The refrigerator takes the hit and a new dent. Precious stares calmly at her mother. Mary almost looks ashamed. Still aglow, Precious grins absently at her mother and then leaves the kitchen.
C: 15A.

S: EXT. HARLEM CITYSCAPE - DAWN
N: The sun rises into the sky. The shadow of a tree draws shorter as does that of an open gate. PRECIOUS' BEDROOM - DAY The clock on the night stand reads 8:29. We drift back to find Precious sitting on the side of her bed fully dressed with neon yellow leggings and her red scarf as she stares at the clock. Various sheets of colored construction paper display Precious' handprints on the wall. Their sizes increase progressively and end beside a poster of Cyndi Lauper. When the clock reads 8:30, Precious stands, looks in a mirror, sees a pretty blond white girl and leaves the room.

S: EXT. 125TH STREET - DAY
N: Precious walks amongst a crowd of people and stops to stare at the Hotel Theresa, a beautiful pre-war building.
S: INT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY
N: Precious enters the lobby. An older black man in a blue uniform sits in a chair reading the Daily News through thick glasses. He doesn't move, react, speak to or look at Precious as she passes him. Precious glances back at him as she reaches the elevators, presses the button and waits. The elevator doors open. Precious steps inside and turns around. Her eyes widen and time slows down. The sound of WIND rises. Moments later, Precious snaps out of her daze and hastily pushes button 19. The doors close.

N: Precious rises....5....8....14....15....and.... DING! 19. The elevator doors fly open.

N: A TICKING CLOCK accompanies ... ...misspelled words ...eraser shreds ...tapping feet ...sweat ...giant letters ...tapping thumb ...tapping pencil ...frowns ...giant numbers ...eraser shreds ...sighs BZZZPFFT! Precious looks up sharply. A square fluorescent light in the ceiling blinks and buzzes as if struggling to stay alive. We tilt down from the blinking light to find that we are in a different place ...
S: INT. DIFFERENT CLASSROOM - DAY
N: A YOUNGER PRECIOUS with uncombed hair sits with her back to us in a bright pink dress. She is at the very back of the classroom. The many children seated in front of her are all blurs that gradually fade into darkness while raising their hands. As we drift towards young Precious, the stains on her dress become more apparent. As we continue drifting, the PLAYGROUND VOICES OF OTHER YOUNG CHILDREN ECHO out... GIRL # 1 (O.S.) ...What that on your dress Precious? GIRL # 2 (O.S.) She don't say nuffin'. She don't talk to nobody. GIRL # 1 (O.S.) She nasty. GIRL # 3 (O.S.) When the last time yo head was combed? Precious mumbles something to herself. GIRL # 4 (O.S.) ...What?! Shut up Precious. You talk funny. You was better when you was on mute.
C: BOY
D: Here come the wide load...
N: Boys makes a lengthy FARTING sound triggering a CHORUS OF LAUGHTER. Our drift finally lands on a puddle of urine at her feet. GIRL # 5 (O.S.) Teacher! Teacher! Precious peeded herself again! GIGGLES fill the air. A small pencil falls into the puddle making a large ripple.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - PRESENT
N: Precious' pencil point has broken but she still holds the pencil as if about to write. Precious sits with an absent look on her face and a bead of sweat on her temple. A moment later, a shadow moves over her test.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: Claireece, do you need another pencil?
E: O.S.
N: The administrator stands over Precious waiting for an answer.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: Claireece ...
N: Precious looks up to her blankly.
C: ADMINISTRATOR
D: Are you finished?
N: Precious nods absently. The administrator gently takes the test from Precious' desk and leaves. Precious lingers pensively in the back of the room.

S: INT. 444 LENOX AVE. KITCHEN - DAY

E: V.O.
N: Precious stops and looks up at something. Before her stands a fast food restaurant with a giant sign atop it that says KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN. Precious looks around, takes a deep breath and steps inside.
S: INT. KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN - DAY
N: Precious approaches the counter with a strained "nonchalance". A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN IN A HAIR-NET waits behind the register. Precious sets her notebook and pencil down on the nearest table.
C: WOMAN
D: What you want baby?
C: PRECIOUS
D: Give me a basket please.
C: WOMAN
D: Sides?
N: Precious' eyes wander from the fry bin all the way over to a refrigerator towards the back.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Ain't sure. still thinkin'. Watchin' the weight you know.
N: The woman chuckles and then leaves for the chicken. The digital clock on the wall reads 8:53. Precious whirls around to see A YOUNG MAN CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH spraying the door with glass cleaner and then wiping it from the bottom up. Precious turns back around to find her server selecting pieces of chicken from a huge tray with large silver tongs. The clock on the wall reads 8:54. Precious turns to the door again to find the young man still cleaning it. Precious turns back around to see her server returning with a basket of chicken.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Potato salad! Thas it.
N: The woman nods, sets the chicken on the counter and heads back towards the refrigerator in one fluid motion. The young man wipes the top of the front door and looks to be about finished.
S: EXT. KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN - DAY
N: Precious bursts out of the restaurant with the bucket under one arm and sprints off down the block. A SCREAM from inside follows.
C: WOMAN
D: REGGIE!!! GET HER!!!
E: O.S.
N: A second later, Reggie, the young man who cleaned the glass, dashes out after Precious. Precious looks back while sprinting and scarfing down pieces of chicken at a remarkable rate. Across the street, SHEILA, Reggie's pregnant girlfriend, screams at him.
C: SHEILA
D: Reggie, where you been? I've been paging your tired ass all night.
N: Reggie stops dead in his tracks. Shit! Busted. He lights up a cigarette, about faces and prepares for her rant.
C: SHEILA
D: Nigga, I knew that was you. And who you running after, some fat bitch. Get your ass over here.
N: Precious turns the corner of 126th street and onto Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard still devouring chicken. A SKINNY DISHEVELED MAN sitting on a standpipe calls out to her.
C: SKINNY MAN
D: You gon catch indigestion Mommie.
S: EXT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY
N: Precious finishes off the chicken at the exact moment she reaches the Hotel, stuffs the bones and basket into a trash bin and dashes into the building.
S: INT. HOTEL THERESA ELEVATOR
N: Precious looks at her watch and then freezes as if something terrible has just dawned on her. 30A.
S: INT. KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN - DAY
N: Precious' notebook and pencil sit on the table where she left them.
S: INT. HOTEL THERESA ELEVATOR
N: Precious looks crestfallen. A glance at her watch makes it worse. Her stomach GROWLS. She suddenly looks unwell.
S: INT. HOTEL THERESA 19TH FLOOR - DAY
N: The elevator doors open. Cornrows speaks on the phone while picking her nails. Several lines are ringing. She waves from behind her desk as Precious walks by.
C: CORNROWS
D: ...What else would get away with clouding your mind, messin your heart and leaving the goddamn toilet seat up? Wait a minute girl....

S: A49 INT. HOTEL THERESA HALLWAY - DAY A49
N: Precious, nauseous, makes her way down the hallway.
S: B49 INT. HOTEL THERESA HALLWAY OUTSIDE MS. RAINS ROOM - DAY B49
N: Precious lunges for a trash bin into which she promptly vomits. She quickly catches her breath. Wipes her mouth and looks 10 feet away at a brightness coming from an open doorway. Her HEART BEATS loudly. Precious stands up. She seems to be there for a considerable spell. A blur of a young girl darts into the room from the other end of the hall without looking at her.
C: 31A. B49 CONTINUED: B49
D: MS. RAIN, PETITE, AFRICAN AMERICAN, BEAUTIFUL, THIRTIES, ALERT EYES enters the hallway looking at her watch and then up to Precious.
C: MS. RAIN

C: MS. RAIN
D: Are you in the A.B.E. class?

C: MS. RAIN
D: You in or you out? This door closes in thirty seconds.
N: Ms. Rain disappears again. Precious' feet finally transport her into the bright doorway. Its blinding light envelopes her completely.
S: INT. CLASSROOM -DAY

Four of them are occupied by girls roughly Precious' age: RHONDA JOHNSON -AFRICAN AMERICAN, STOCKY AND EVEN TALLER THAN PRECIOUS, RITA ROMERO -LATIN DESCENT, MEDIUM BUILD, FRIENDLY FACE AND DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK, JERMAINE HICKS WIRY, LEAN, SEATED AND DRESSED LIKE A BOY and CONSUELO MONTENEGRO - LATIN DESCENT, PETITE GLOWING AND GORGEOUS. She twirls her hair incessantly with slender painted fingertips. A seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath the windows. The girls all stare up at Precious blankly as she enters the room. Precious looks to be in a mild state of shock as she gazes around from the girls to Ms. Rain to the clouds outside the windows.
C: PRECIOUS
D: First thing I wonder is where is everybody -the boyz, the noises ...this feel like a Sunday school or crazy house...or something like bof' but different. Smell different too.
E: V.O.
N: Precious' eyes land on the lone desk in the rear of the room.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Have a seat.
E: O.S.
N: Precious looks from the distant desk to one up front and then back to the distant desk. She sits with the other girls delicately, as if she were a visitor in a complete stranger's home. Ms. Rain finishes marking the roll sheet, places the cap on her pen and holds up a notebook identical to the one Precious left at the Kickin Fried Chicken.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Does everyone have her notebook?
N: Precious sucks her teeth in self-disgust as she looks around to find that all the other girls have theirs. JO ANN ROGERS -CAREFREE, CUTE AND SMUG, then breezes into the room with an air of insubordination.

C: MS. RAIN
D: We're all in this together Rita. Class?
C: ALL BUT RITA
D: E!
N: Rita picks up the largest shard of chalk from the floor and writes E on the board. She hands the chalk to Precious and Precious writes F. The entire class sits simultaneously and then giggles at their synchronicity.

C: MS. RAIN
D: Precious?
C: PRECIOUS
D: I can't do that Miz Rain.
C: MS. RAIN

N: Precious looks mortified and starts breathing heavily. RAPID MONTAGE - DOOR SLAMS, MOANS, PANTING, PLATES BREAKING, MEAT SIZZLING, ZIPPERS, GRUNTS, SQUEAKING BED SPRINGS, LAUGHTER, SCREAMS, A RAZOR SLICING YOUNG FLESH, SWEAT and DAYTIME TELEVISION all assault her mind's senses. Ms. Rain speaks with a dire look of concern on her face but no words come out. She places a hand on Precious' shoulder and the kaleidoscope of sounds sucks away into the air. The words from Ms. Rain's mouth finally register.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Precious. Honey are you okay? Try to relax. Should I call an ambulance? 911? Your moth ...
C: PRECIOUS

E: beat
C: PRECIOUS
D: The words.
N: Ms. Rain sighs. She sits back for a moment and looks as if she's processing more than just the tragedy of this particular situation but what is that of countless others. In a decisive, almost militaristic movement, Ms. Rain sits up again.
C: MS. RAIN
D: I think I understand you Precious but I still want you to try. You're going to have to push yourself.
N: Precious looks back down at the page. There are people of various colors on a beach.
C: MS. RAIN
D: What do you think the story is about?
C: PRECIOUS
D: Peoples at the beach?
C: MS. RAIN
D: That's right.
N: Ms. Rain points to the letter A. It is the first word on the page.

C: MS. RAIN
D: 'Shore'. That word is 'shore'. That's almost like 'beach'. Very good. Can you read the whole thing?
N: Precious nods.
C: PRECIOUS
D: A-Day-at-the-Shore.
N: Amazed the words that escaped were from her very own mouth, Precious' jaw drops. She whirls to Ms. Rain. Ms. Rain smiles. We ease away from the office as the two of them continue working down the page.

N: A picturesque plate of pork chops and mashed potatoes. Precious delivers it to the couch with a fork and knife. THE APARTMENT HAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE PRISTINE WORLD OF THE TV SITCOM THEY WERE WATCHING. Precious and Mary are well- dressed and done-up like TV stars.

N: Precious eats reluctantly.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT
N: Pots and pans sit drying on the counter. Precious wipes her hands on a dishcloth. The room is quiet and empty now. Precious stares blankly out of the window. ...She goes to the television, presses the remote and sits down. "THE COSBYS" is still on. Tired and full, she turns the TV off. She watches Mary's face snoring rhythmically but with extremely unpleasant noises. Finally, she backs away and goes to her bedroom.
S: INT. PRECIOUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Precious falls back across her bed with her arms spread. She stares up at the crack in her ceiling... A hand darts into frame, touches Precious' side and then quickly withdraws. Precious ignores it. The hand returns for another jab. Precious restrains a grin. Finally the hand tickles her fiercely. She giggles uncontrollably. The hand belongs to Tom Cruise. He wears a leather jacket with a cherry red motorcycle helmet tucked under one arm. The helmet has a golden bow stuck on its crown. ...Precious chases him out of frame for some revenge tickling as they both laugh quietly. ...The helmet falls to the floor with a bounce.

N: TOOSIE, A WOMAN IN HER LATE 50'S RADIATING A TOUGHNESS OF PRIOR GENERATIONS, enters the apartment in a business-like manner with MONGO, A SMALL, DISTRACTED AND OBVIOUSLY HANDICAPPED CHILD. Toosie has a bag of groceries in her other arm. Precious watches TV beside her mother. Both appear as if they've just woken up. Mary attempts to put on her wig and make up. Toosie gives Mongo to Mary, whose eyes never leave the television, and then hands the groceries to Precious, who takes them directly to the kitchen as Toosie leaves without a word.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Mongo?
E: O.S.
C: MS. WEISS

E: O.S.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Alla dat.
E: O.S.
N: The child seems only mildly aware of what is going on. The DOORBELL rings again. Precious opens the door. A HISPANIC WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES with an attache case enters. As the woman steps inside, we see that Mary has finished tidying herself. Mary and the woman exchange small talk while Precious listens. Mary has never seemed so congenial.
C: PRECIOUS
D: My grandmuver Toosie, brangs Little Mongo over on days social worker come so it look like Mongo live wif us. Then my mama get the check 'n food stamps for me 'n Little Mongo. But it's my baby. Little Mongo is money for me, not her!

D: How do you respond to them?
C: PRECIOUS
D: I say, "Check wif my muver." After that, they just look at me and go down through the floor. The family downstairs is vampires so that's where they should go.

N: Jo Ann poses like an Egyptian hieroglyphic. Consuelo examines her nail polish.
S: INT. CLASSROOM -DAY
N: Ms. Rain writes briskly across the blackboard. As she makes her way across the frame, a barrage of letters and numbers peel off the board, fly across the room, converge and enter Precious' forehead. Just before the letters and numbers reach Precious, lifelike holographic images flank them. They are SPINNING PLANETS, FLYING PTERODACTYLS, STAMPEDING ELEPHANTS, EMMETT TILL, MLK, JFK, MALCOLM X, CIVIL RIGHTS MARCHERS, FIRE, TIDAL WAVES, A VOLCANIC ERUPTION, CONTINENTS, MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS, LIGHT BULBS AND THE INVERTED WORDS "JANIE", "SULA" AND "CELIE" ... A few letters, numbers and images try to reach Jo Ann but most just bounce off of her and fall away. Consuelo bats a few mathematical symbols off as if they were flies. Finally we land on Precious as she confidently stabs her hand into the air to answer a question.
S: INT. CITY BUS - DAY
N: Precious rides on one of the side seats towards the back while wearing her red scarf. The New Yorkers surrounding her are all men of various backgrounds. All wear the exact same suits and raincoats. Precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down at her. We pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other passengers studying Precious in silence as well.
C: PRECIOUS
D: I liked'd that museum so much I went back by myself... Peoples ...They only look when my belly big. They minds all made. But do they know? No. They do not know that I am a girl for flowers and thin straw legs?
E: V.O.
C: PRECIOUS
D: If other peoples could see that the way I do, they would see that I am a real person inside.
E: V.O.
N: Our long circular pan finally lands on Precious' seat but sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from Precious' bedroom mirror wearing Precious' clothes. The bus grinds to a stop. A man smiles at Precious and steps off the bus. The original Precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his empty seat and tries to read it. Precious stops to watch two "society" ladies in hats and gloves push antique buggy style baby carriages along the sidewalk.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Miz Rain say the longest journey begin wif a single step. I wonder what step they journeys begin on. Mama always talk about how there be all different types of welfare. I want filfy rich white folks welfare. Mama crazy but Mama not stupid.
E: V.O.
N: Precious continues observing pensively as the ladies pass a bearded and bedraggled elderly white man laying on the street in tattered clothes. As Precious studies him, her expression changes ever so slightly. Enormous handwritten letters forming "NOT STUPID" overtake her face as we DISSOLVE TO the PAGE upon which she wrote it.
S: INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Precious writes in her notebook. All of the other girls do the same.
C: PRECIOUS

C: PRECIOUS
D: Listen Baby, Muver love you. Muver not dumb. Listen:

N: PRECIOUS (CONT'D) PRECIOUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) (in a whisper) Thas the alphabet. Twenty-six ABCDEFGHIJKLPMN letters in all. Them letters O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z. make up words. Them words everything. Precious looks up from her page gazing in an otherworldly way. One by one, the other girls stop what they're doing and stare at Precious curiously. Their eyes turn downward in unison. CLOSE ON Precious' legs. A gush of water pours down between them as if it were a tidal wave.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: SILENT MONTAGE ...The wheels of a speeding gurney waggle to remain straight. ...Fluorescent lights stream by overhead. ...Name tags dangle from the chests of attendants pushing the gurney.

T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: We are close on Precious. Her eyes focus intently and occasionally dart up and down. Nurse John is doing the same thing. His hands lay on top of Precious' with their palms touching. We glimpse both of their searching eyes again. Suddenly, Precious whips her hands over and SLAPS the back of John's before he can pull them away.
C: PRECIOUS

C: PRECIOUS
D: Dear Miz Rain, All the years I sit in class I never learn, but now I got baby again by my fahver.

S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Jo Ann bounds into the room with the journal in her hand, swipes an apple from Precious' tray and takes a bite. Precious snatches the journal and opens it quickly.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Dear Precious, It seems the opposite to me. If you keep Abdul you might have nothing. You are learning to read and write, that is everything. Come back to school when you get out of the hospital. You're only seventeen. Your whole life is in front of you.
E: V.O.

N: Precious climbs the stairs growing short of breath holding Abdul, her bags and her coat folded over one arm. Once on the landing, she searches for her keys while trying to balance Abdul and everything else. After turning several locks, she pushes into the apartment...

N: Mary charges into frame to ram Precious and Abdul like a bull. Precious sidesteps the charge as Mary leaves a huge indentation in the wall knocking over a side table and a potted plant in the process. She grabs her shoulder in pain. Precious backs away around the living room to flee. Mary hurls what's left of the plant at Precious from down on the floor. Precious turns her back to shield Abdul. The pot strikes her in the back. ABDUL SCREAMS louder. Dirt covers Precious.

She checks Abdul immediately. He is smiling. A DOOR OPENS followed by GRUNTS and a CRASH. Precious looks up to find the broken television tumbling down the steps towards them. At the last second, Precious manages to roll them both out of the way as the television crashes to the landing shattering some more.

N: Bare light bulbs hang from the ceiling. Precious lays on a bed breast feeding Abdul and staring up at the ceiling while covered in a blanket. We sail away to find they are surrounded by scores of rudimentary beds, many of which are filled with other women of varying ages. A BUG LADY lies next to her with unkempt hair and sores on her skin.
C: BUG LADY
D: ...Put your bags in bed with you. Put your bags in the bed with you. Put 'em in. Tuck 'em in bed with you...

C: BUG LADY
D: Give the chile back her blanket!
C: FEROCIOUS WOMAN
D: Fuck you. I ain' giving back shit.
N: The woman walks away. Physically and emotionally spent, Precious sighs and then lifts her bed's top sheet, beneath which is a plastic-covered mattress. She then wraps the sheet around Abdul and herself and hunkers down. Precious rocks Abdul gently as her eyes wander around the cavernous armory.

D: Where my baby?! Where my baby at?!
N: The Bug Lady casually points to the exit. The large ferocious woman heads for the exit with Abdul in one arm and Precious' bag in the other. She looks down at Abdul making "baby" faces and sounds. Precious dashes after her but winces in pain grabbing her pelvic area along the way. The Bug Lady follows Precious as a speed walker might. Precious snatches Abdul and promptly knees the ferocious woman hard in the gut. The ferocious woman MOANS as she falls to the ground. Precious continues kicking and stomping her without abandon. The bug girl observes stoically. Abdul WAILS. As she trounces the woman, Precious' eyes fill with a rage we haven't yet seen. Finally, two other women pull Precious away while she still kicks at the woman. The ferocious woman, now bloodied, falls over on her back with her eyes closed and her mouth hanging open.

Ms. Rain clears the table of plates and take-out containers. WHITNEY HOUSTON IS PLAYING LOUD. KATHERINE, A SEXY BLACK WOMAN who it seems has just awoken, descends the stairs. She's not in a good mood.

C: PRECIOUS
D: Mama say homos is bad peoples ...
E: V.O.
N: A hand intercepts the bottle. It is Ms. Rain's. She then pours it into her own glass and takes the bottle with her as she returns to Katherine.

Precious stands beside Ms. Rain holding a small trophy and a check. The other girls flank them standing very straight. All wear big grins. FLASHPWOOWF! Nurse John, without his uniform, has just taken a picture of everyone. The girls go straight for the cookies and punch waiting atop an orange tablecloth on Ms. Rain's desk. They begin a Soul Train Line and dance around the desk as Nurse John approaches Ms. Rain to converse.

N: Precious looks both confused and relieved. Ms. Rain sits while motioning for Precious to do the same.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Me? I never...
E: sitting
N: Precious stops as Ms. Rain looks away as if gathering her thoughts. Finally...
C: MS. RAIN
D: Last night I had a conversation with my mother, and that never happens cause our relationship is.... complicated. We don't speak, and when we do, it always ends in a fight about my filthy misguided existence. Most times I feel terrible for days afterwards wondering whether all the hateful things she said are true. Those days I just feel like...like...
C: PRECIOUS
D: Nuffin?
C: MS. RAIN
D: ...Yeah. I didn't feel so bad this time though. Cause this time I thought about how strong you've had to be and then I decided that I had nothing to be ashamed of and that my mother was wrong about me, my dad and 5 or 6 hundred other things. You ask if you can help me? Baby, you already have.

D: Suit yourself.
E: standing
N: Ms. Rain motions to the other end of a long folding table. Precious takes hold of it and they carry it across the room together. As we watch from a distance...
C: PRECIOUS
D: Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples. I think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before. And in that tunnel, maybe the only light they had was one that was inside of them and then -even long after they escaped that tunnel, they still be shining for everybody else. Thas Miz Rain to me.

S: INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE: PRECIOUS' ROOM - DAY
N: Precious' trophy sits on the windowsill beneath a thin a layer of dust. A stack of books sit on her bureau. Colorful letters and numbers hang on the wall. Beneath them hang postcards featuring Zora Neal Hurston, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou and Oprah Winfrey. Abdul sleeps in his crib. Precious makes her bed.
C: PRECIOUS
D: In a book I read, a lady escaped to a 1/2 way house. And the lady, she asked the people there just what a 1/2 way house was.

D: It's not Rhonda.
N: Precious stops.
S: INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
N: Precious descends a staircase to a long corridor clearly deep in thought every step of the way. She stops momentarily to straighten her clothes. When she finally reaches a day room at the other end of the hall, she looks through its window for a moment. Mary sits inside crushing and dwarfing the couch upon which she waits. She looks frail. Her wig is half combed. She's nervous. Her sweaty hands crumple her cigarette package. Precious covers her nose a moment, lowers her hand, readies herself and then steps into the room.
S: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
N: Once inside the room, and for the first time, Precious' soft face looks like stone. Mary looks up with a brief but quickly fading smile that is pathetic, apologetic and grim. Precious waits. The air is thick without a single word between them. Finally, Mary looks down.
C: MARY
D: Your daddy dead.
N: Precious looks surprised for a moment but still composed. Mary waits for a response.
C: PRECIOUS
D: ...Is that all?
C: MARY
D: No. Carl ...Carl had that AIDS virus.
E: beat
N: A previously unseen woman sitting across the room looks up from behind a newspaper. Precious stays stone-faced until she finally GASPS as the aftershock of the revelation hits her squarely. The man across the room collects his hat and coat and leaves. INSERT -GLIMPSES OF CARL REMOVING HIS BELT, CARL THRUSTING ON TOP OF PRECIOUS, PRECIOUS FOLLOWING ABDUL TAKING EARLY STEPS. We return to the dayroom as Precious opens her eyes and lifts them to Mary slowly.

C: PRECIOUS
D: You better go to the doctor Ma.
N: Mary looks up delicately.
C: MARY
D: You welcome back home.
C: PRECIOUS
D: I'm home here. I better go see 'bout Abdul and do homework.
E: beat
N: Mary doesn't move as Precious leaves. Mary sits staring at the floor at the far side of the room.
S: INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE: PRECIOUS' ROOM - DAY
N: Precious enters, takes Abdul from his crib, holds him closely and sits on her bed. Moments later, a TAPPING on the window draws her attention. Precious rises to find Tom Cruise hurling pebbles up at her window in a leather jacket. A MOTORCYCLE sits a few feet away from him. He beckons her. She stares down at him with solemn eyes. Tom finally mounts his bike and vanishes into thin air while revving its engine. Mary then crosses the frame where he was. Precious turns to Abdul and kisses him on the head.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Precious walks over the crest of a hill deep in thought with her hands in her pockets. The constant HUM of the city seems lower than usual as Precious' FOOTSTEPS make the most prominent sound. From this distant view, it appears as if she is almost walking in place.
S: INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Ms. Rain stands before the blackboard with a piece of chalk in her hand pointing to the word "unrelenting", which is written behind her. Consuelo is missing and TWO NEW GIRLS, AISHA, INDIAN AND FROM GUYANA AND BUNNY, VERY THIN WITH BAD TEETH have joined the class.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Rita, what do I mean when the author describes her protagonist's circumstances as "unrelenting"?
C: RITA
D: I don't know Miz Rain.
C: MS. RAIN
D: C'mon Rita, think about the question before you just give up like that...
N: Ms. Rain's voice trails off as we find Precious lost in thought.
S: INT. CLINIC - DAY
N: Precious waits in a small gray office. A FEMALE COUNSELOR WITH SYMPATHETIC EYES carrying a file sits across from her. Her eyes say everything. The counselor places a hand on top of Precious'.
S: INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY

N: Precious doesn't respond.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Precious?
N: The entire class looks up at Precious. Ms. Rain waits for a response.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Precious, bring your journal to me.
N: Precious waits a moment and then shakes her head without looking up. Ms. Rain goes to her desk and picks up the journal without resistance. The words "Why me?" sit alone on the page with lines crossed through them. Ms. Rain returns the journal to Precious' desk still opened to the same page.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Precious, would you come to my office for a moment?
N: Precious doesn't respond. The class still watches curiously. Ms. Rain, steps back, sits on the edge of her desk and folds her arms.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Preci-
C: PRECIOUS
D: Nurse say I am H.I.V. positive.
N: The air changes sharply. Everything stops. Precious exhales.
C: PRECIOUS
D: I don't have nuffin to write today and I don't hate no one. Not even my muhver. My head is all dark inside so I don't have nuffin to write today...Maybe nuffin never.
N: Rita rises, walks to Precious and embraces her. Tears well in Precious' eyes. Still trying to stay composed, Precious wipes her face. Ms. Rain rises, walks to Precious and rubs her back as she looks around to the other girls who are still stunned.
C: RHONDA
D: Your baby okay?
N: The class waits on pins and needles. Precious doesn't answer at first and just looks down until ...
C: PRECIOUS
D: Yeah. He good...Won't bress feed him no more to be safe.
C: MS. RAIN
D: One time in your journal you told me that you had never really told your story. write.
E: to Precious softly
N: Precious' eyes well up some more. She wipes her face again.
C: PRECIOUS
D: What for? How?! I feel like I am drowning inside a giant river Miz Rain. Thas what...
N: Precious stops herself abruptly as if being overwhelmed by a sense of futility.
C: MS. RAIN
D: I think telling your story will get you over that river Precious ...
N: Precious erupts hurling her journal sharply across the room. It bounces hard off the blackboard and stops abruptly on the floor facedown.
C: PRECIOUS
D: FUCK YOU! YOU DON'T KNOW NUFFIN WHAT I BEEN THROUGH!!! I NEVER HAD NO BOYFRIEND! MY DADDY SAY HE GONNA MARRY ME BUT HOW HE DO THAT, FUCKING ME ILLEGAL? I NEVER BEEN NO CHILD! NOT EVEN ONE DAY!!!
N: The class looks shocked. Precious' wet eyes are filled with fury. A moment later, Ms. Rain walks calmly across the room, retrieves the journal and places it back on top of Precious' desk.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Open your notebook Precious.
C: PRECIOUS
D: I'm tired Miz Rain!
E: exasperated
C: MS. RAIN
D: I know you are but you can't stop now. You gotta fight through this. You still have to live your life and do the best you can with the hand you've been dealt. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
N: Precious HUFFS cynically.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Nobody love me. Thas a lie.

D: People do love you Precious.
C: PRECIOUS
D: Please don't lie Miz Rain! Love?! Me?! Love rape me, beat me, call me animal, get me sick and make me feel wurfless. I had enough love.
C: MS. RAIN
D: That wasn't love. There are people in this room who love you. Your child loves you too. Is that clear Precious? Now if Rita decided to just give up? Would you let her?
N: Precious doesn't answer.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Would you?!
C: PRECIOUS
D: No.
E: reluctantly
C: MS. RAIN
D: And why not?!
N: Precious doesn't answer.
C: MS. RAIN
D: Because you love her...as much as she loves you.
N: Precious looks to her side and finds Rita smiling reassuringly through her crooked teeth.
C: MS. RAIN

C: MS. RAIN
D: No! So stop worrying about it. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Trust me -no, trust yourself. My concern now is that if this Ms. Weiss is someone you're working with and can't trust, she's out! We gotta find somebody else.
