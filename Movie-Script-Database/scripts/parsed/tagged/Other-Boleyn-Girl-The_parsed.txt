M: FEBRUARY 2006
S: EXT. FIELD - DAY
N: We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of children's laughter. Excited shrieking. A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE, and sister, ANNE, (10). Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head skimming along the sheaves. REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).
C: SIR THOMAS
D: I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne. From the Carey family.
E: a beat
N: SIR THOMAS indicates to ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired. Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: But that's wonderful.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: I turned it down.
N: LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'
C: SIR THOMAS
D: And offered them Mary instead.
N: SIR THOMAS indicates MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired. Pretty. Sweet-natured.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do (better than a merchant's son.
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: You underestimate Mary.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer.
N: The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart.
N: On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished. SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Bravo! Anne!
E: applauding his favourite
S: EXT. BELL TOWER - TEN YEARS LATER
N: Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church.
S: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door.
C: ANNE
D: May we come in..?
N: ANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle..
C: ANNE
D: Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful than me. Married before me. I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn Girl.'
E: a beat
C: MARY
D: Hardly.
C: GEORGE
D: No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity?
N: GEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An intimate moment.
C: MARY
D: No, George. Never. I'll be married, that's all.. Apart from that - it won't change a thing.
E: a beat
N: The three of them hug together, tightly..
S: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
N: A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air is thick with incense. And winter cold.. The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled on one side. FATHER, MOTHER, the DUKE and DUCHESS of NORFOLK, brother GEORGE, and finally ANNE..
C: PRIEST
D: Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobis..
N: The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY, (35), puts it on MARY's finger. few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.
S: INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT
N: The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom, (WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and other GUESTS..
C: WILLIAM
D: Are you happy?
C: MARY
D: Very.
C: WILLIAM
D: You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title?
C: MARY
D: No. I want a husband who loves me. And who thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night.
C: WILLIAM
D: Then you've found the right man.
N: IN ANOTHER CORNER: ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church..
C: ANNE
D: Who is that? He was staring at me in church?
C: GEORGE
D: That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in England.
N: ANNE's eyes widen in interest, "Really?"
C: GEORGE
D: But don't get your hopes up. He is already betrothed.
N: GEORGE indicates a tall, haughty-looking FIANCEE beside PERCY..
C: ANNE
D: Betrothed is not married, brother George. A lot can happen before you reach the altar.
N: ANNE stares over at HENRY PERCY. Who stares back. IN ANOTHER CORNER: he DUKE OF NORFOLK, the most powerful nobleman in the room, and close personal friend of the KING's walks with his growling DOGS to where SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and LADY ELIZABETH are sitting. SIR THOMAS gets to his feet..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Thomas..
N: he DUKE ignores THOMAS, and goes instead to his sister, (LADY ELIZABETH), and kisses her..
C: NORFOLK
D: I think I have managed to persuade the King to come and stay with you on progress. A week-end's hunting in late summer.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much.. Did you hear that, Elizabeth?
E: he turns to ELIZABETH
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: Yes.
E: hates the idea
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court.
N: LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves..
C: NORFOLK
D: These are difficult times. I have it on good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved. a beat) It cannot be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: What? And make a bastard King of England?
C: NORFOLK
D: A legitimized bastard. What choice does he have? Obviously, I've given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same?
E: a beat
N: NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: What about Anne?
N: SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's dancing with GEORGE...
C: SIR THOMAS
D: I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not officially a `Howard', but as your sister's daughter..
C: NORFOLK
D: But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: If Anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say `yes'. But she's not.
N: SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: She's anything but.
S: INT. BOLEYN CASTLE - DAY
N: SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH stand in a corner, watching the party continue. ELIZABETH's face darkens..
C: ADY ELIZABETH
D: don't like it. It would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit. Money we don't have.
E: MORE
N: And what if theDY ELIZABETH(cont'd) LA king doesn't like her? Or if she sleeps with him but gives him a girl?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: And what if you were to look on the bright side? Just once?
N: An ominous clap of thunder outside..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Risk nothing, you gain nothing.
N: ADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband..
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Easy for you to say. You've had power and wealth all your life.
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: Until I married you, Thomas. And I was happy to give it up.
N: LADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: ANNE knocks on the door of her father's study. She waits. Presently, the door opens. We see SIR THOMAS inside..
C: ANNE
D: You asked to see me father?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Yes. Come in.
N: SIR THOMAS closes the door.
S: INT. HEVER CASTLE - NIGHT
N: MARY is in a bathroom. Being prepared by ANNE for her wedding night. ANNE brushes her sister's hair. Rubs oil in her skin.
C: MARY
D: o - the King himself is coming to Hever. I'm so happy for George.
C: ANNE
D: Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems he has ambitions for me, too.
E: a beat MORE
N: He thinks I'm ANNE(coage dnow...and of not of an nt' ) unpleasing appearance...
C: MARY
D: What? What are you saying..?
C: ANNE
D: It's known the King has a wandering eye. Imagine...if he were to like me?
C: MARY
D: But...you could never be more than his mistress. And that's no substitute for a husband.
C: ANNE
D: But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to? a beat) Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least.
C: MARY
D: But what about your happiness? Your future?
N: ANNE shrugs, smiles..
C: ANNE
D: I could be a happy Duchess.
S: INT. BEDROOOM - NIGHT
N: 0 10 MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares at the bed. A child. Suddenly terrified.
C: ANNE
D: Are you nervous?
C: MARY
D: A little.
C: ANNE
D: You'll tell me everything in the morning?
C: MARY
D: I promise.
C: ANNE
D: No details spared?
N: The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional. The door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes. MARY stares at her husband.
C: MARY
D: Hold me a moment?
N: WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms.. MARY (cont'd) I'm so lucky to have a man who is content with what he has. MARY looks at him.. MARY (cont'd) You are, aren't you? WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride..
C: WILLIAM
D: I am the luckiest man in the world.
N: WILLIAM reaches for the wine.. WILLIAM (cont'd) Drink? MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists.. WILLIAM (cont'd) You should. It will hurt less. MARY nervously drinks.. WILLIAM (cont'd) Lie back. MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls down his trousers. MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly lowers himself on top of her. He enters her. MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one might not have imagined. But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her. MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it? WILLIAM (cont'd) Thank you. WILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused. aybe this is how it's meant to be.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust. The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake. The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS, who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS.. It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not, This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end. Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome, in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough, intimidating lot. Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books.. Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS. Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance, etc. Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting. And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS, and a second STANDARD BEARER..
S: EXT. HEVER - DAY
N: 2 12 The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance.. Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder approaching. His expression changes...
S: EXT. HEVER - ESTATE - DAY
N: Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as STAFFORD calls out, "The King!"
S: INT. HEVER - DAY
N: ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside, she rushes over to the window to see the approaching RIDERS. ANNE looks out of the window. Scans the approaching RIDERS until she finds the KING..
C: ANNE
D: There he is!

C: ANNE
D: You think he will like me?
C: MARY
D: Of course, sister. How could he not?
N: ANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly.
S: EXT. HEVER - DAY
N: The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens). MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside her. The proud PARENTS. Everyone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Your Majesty, you are most welcome.
N: The King dismounts athletically. His DOGS are unleashed, bark excitedly..
C: HENRY
D: Sir Thomas. kisses hand) Lady Elizabeth..
N: A SERVANT in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings wine on a tray. HENRY takes a glass..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: May I present my son, George.
N: GEORGE, visibly nervous, bows deeply from the neck. But HENRY's attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind GEORGE..
C: HENRY
D: Your Uncle tells me I should have you at court. Should I?
E: while staring at MARY
C: GEORGE
D: It would be a great honour, Sir.
N: MARY dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: And our daughter, Anne.
N: ENRY turns to see ANNE.
C: ENRY
D: No one said anything of a daughter.
N: ANNE curtseys deeply...
C: HENRY
D: Had we known, we might have come sooner.
C: ANNE
D: Your Majesty..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you around our modest house?
C: HENRY
D: A pleasure.
N: ANNE offers HENRY her hand. He takes it, then leads ANNE away. MARY shoots ANNE a look, `Good luck'.

C: HENRY
D: What's that?
N: HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..
C: ANNE
D: falcon, your Grace.

D: I can see that. But what's it doing there? More to the point.. ..not just there, but in every corner in the house?
E: turns 360
C: ANNE
D: I have no idea. Ask my father. a beat) Perhaps because falcons are vaguely associative with field sports - field sports with aristocracy - and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms.. ...a man with ambition will do the strangest things.
E: shrugs
N: HENRY is delighted by ANNE's candour..
C: ENRY
D: That's a sharp tongue you have. a beat) I wonder what it might say about me behind my back?
C: ANNE
D: Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from me. Unless he fears an excess of compliments.
N: HENRY smiles, visibly charmed..
C: HENRY
D: Really? And what would they be..?
N: WATCHING FROM ABOVE, MARY smiles to herself, "Well done, Anne", as HENRY and ANNE continue down a corridor..
S: INT. BOLEYN HOUSE - EVENING
N: The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled, frantically changing ANNE from her day attire to her finest evening clothes. SIR THOMAS watches..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Bravo, Anne! The King was quite smitten! Told me so himself. And has requested you sit beside him at dinner.
N: SIR THOMAS adjusts her hair..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I knew you would up to the task.
N: MARY watches. A momentary stab of jealousy at FATHER's attention. But as ANNE looks over at MARY for support.. MARY smiles. Shakes herself out of it. It's her sister. What was she thinking?
S: INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT
N: MUSIC is being played. Everyone is dressed in their finest, a packed banquet hall. MUSICIANS come to a climax, loud and enthusiastic applause from everyone. HENRY gets to his feet..

D: ..I had it from the lips of the Spanish ambassador himself. That our musicians are the envy of all Europe.
C: BRANDON
D: ..then he was flattering you, your Grace.
C: HENRY
D: Our Universities and philosophers, too.
C: BRANDON
D: ...another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans.
C: HENRY
D: What of our painters, then?
C: RANDON
D: Years behind their Italian counterparts. The truth is far from leading the world, we're a provincial outpost, lagging far behind.
C: HENRY
D: What? Is no one proud to be English? Anne? What say you?
E: turns to ANNE
N: ANNE gulps. The clanking of cutlery. All eyes on her.
C: ANNE
D: Me, my Lord? clears throat) I know little of such matters, but I've not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a generation.
C: ENRY
D: Well said.
C: ANNE
D: Or our navy? The finest in the world.
C: HENRY
D: It's true.
C: ANNE
D: The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More?
C: HENRY
D: Never!
C: ANNE
D: I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more prosperous..
C: HENRY
D: She's right, by God! She's right!
N: HENRY is delighted. SIR THOMAS stares proudly across the room at ANNE. Who's hand, we notice, is shaking. Her heart pounding in her chest.
S: INT. STAIRCASE - BOLEYN HOUSE - NIGHT
N: SIR THOMAS stops ANNE on her way upstairs.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: You did well tonight. Very well. Quite enough to be invited to court, I am sure of it.

C: SIR THOMAS
D: Now go to bed. Get a good night's sleep. Because there's still the hunt tomorrow. a beat) You must excel at that.

S: EXT. HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY
N: The following morning.. Thirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired Lurchers), barking frantically. t's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation. The MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful, ornate saddlery. number of OTHER LADIES are also going hunting, and we notice they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN, sitting behind them, holding onto them.. inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns..
C: HENRY
D: Good morning, Anne.
N: ANNE curtseys deeply..
C: ANNE
D: Good morning, your Grace.
C: HENRY
D: ho will you be riding with?
N: It's clearly an invitation. He indicates there is room for ANNE on the back of his saddle. But ANNE fails to read the signal.
C: ANNE
D: On my own your Grace.
C: HENRY
D: Your own..?
N: A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse.
C: ANNE
D: They have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own.
N: ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..
C: HENRY
D: ut with no man to hold onto? How will you stay on the horse?
C: ANNE
D: Why? The same way you hold onto yours, your Grace.
N: A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE has made.
C: HENRY
D: We'll see.
N: ENRY yanks the reins on his horse..
C: HENRY
D: Let's away!
N: ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows.
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

S: EXT. FIELDS - DAY
N: 3 23 Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head.. The sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching footsteps, like thunder. The STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest.
S: EXT. FIELDS - DAY
N: The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost delirious with primal agitation.. Among the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts.. n the advanced group, are HENRY, several COURTIERS, his GUARDS and, of course, ANNE.. They jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see.. ANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades. He urges his horse to greater speed..
C: HENRY

C: HENRY
D: Then we must follow.
S: INT. FOREST - DAY
N: HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind.. Sharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches, and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly impervious to the whipping branches..
C: ANNE
D: Hah!
N: Ahead, the DEER darts and weaves. The HOUNDS give chase.
S: EXT. FOREST - RAVINE - DAY
N: 7 27 alf a mile ahead.. A steep ravine, with a sheer drop of twenty-five feet deep. At the bottom, a brook with dangerous rocks, then another sheer climb of twenty-five feet the other side. The DEER arrives, looks, then scampers down the ravine, pursued by the HOUNDS. he remaining RIDERS arrive. They see the DEER scramble up the other side, followed by the DOGS, slipping in the mud, and struggling with the brook. everal DOGS fall. Yelping in fright and pain as they lose footing and fall on the rocks. The KING pulls up his horse.. HENRY raises his hat, and salutes the DEER.
C: ENRY
D: he King of England defeated by a humble fawn.

D: Hah!
E: suddenly kicking horse
N: The COURTIERS gasp in disbelief as ANNE lurches forward, and leaps into space, heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine. orse and rider almost tumble down the vertiginous, lethal drop. But, reaching the bottom, the horse leaps across the brook, then scrambles up the other side. She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her. long silence. Nothing but the sound of wind in the trees..
C: COURTIER
D: Please, your Majesty. It's not safe.
N: HENRY turns and stares daggers at the COURTIER, `Silence'. He stares across the ravine at ANNE. Their eyes meet. hen he kicks his horse, `Hah!', and lurches forward. He heads down the sheer ravine. The COURTIERS gasp, rush to the edge of the ravine to watch. ANNE goes to the edge her side. ENRY's horse slides perilously down the ravine, then struggles to clear the brook, and lands heavily in the water. he KING struggles to keep control, and as the horse tries to scramble up the bank the other side, it loses it's footing in the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air.. he COURTIERS cry out in horror, ANNE covers her mouth as.. The KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks.. Pandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of horror, raising the alarm. ANNE's FACE: what has she done?
S: INT. HEVER - NIGHT

D: What?!?
S: INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME
N: WILLIAM STAFFORD watches from the doorway as the DUKE of NORFOLK, WILLIAM CAREY and SIR THOMAS smile delightedly, staring at MARY..
C: NORFOLK
D: ou're to pack and leave first thing in the morning.
N: MARY shoots a desperate look at her husband..
C: NORFOLK
D: The King himself has secured you a position in the Queen's household.
C: MARY
D: ut I don't want to go to court. Nor does my husband.
N: Silence.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: ell her.
N: WILLIAM CAREY clears his throat. Avoids MARY's eyes..
C: WILLIAM
D: The King has also offered me a position. As Gentleman of the Privy Council.
C: MARY
D: What?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Y'hear that? Gentleman of the Privy Council! Attending to the private and personal needs of his Majesty himself! That's the inner sanctum!
N: MARY's shell-shocked, lost for words..
C: MARY
D: But what about our future? Here in the country?
C: NORFOLK
D: Put it out of your mind. From now on your home is at court.
C: MARY
D: William, please! Don't you understand what this means?
N: MARY stares imploringly..
C: MARY
D: They will separate us. Put me in different accommodation. Where the King can always...find me.
N: WILLIAM CAREY averts his eyes..
C: NORFOLK
D: Happily your husband understands the value of such an opportunity. For us all.
E: a beat
C: MARY
D: What about Anne? Couldn't she go instead?
N: SIR THOMAS's expression darkens. A flicker of pain.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: The way that girl behaved this week-end, she can count herself lucky she still has a home.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
N: ANNE'S FACE, outside the door: it's as if a knife had been plunged into her gut. She turns and runs down the corridor..
S: INT. WILLIAM CAREY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: WILLIAM and MARY lie in bed. MARY is equally wretched. Tears are also running down her cheeks. She stares at her husband..
C: MARY
D: How could he DO this to me? My own father. a beat) What if we just refused?
C: WILLIAM
D: We would be cut off. He made that clear.
C: MARY
D: But would that be so bad?
N: MARY stares at him..
C: MARY
D: Position means nothing to me. Nor wealth. We could find somewhere. A small farm. Away from everything.
C: WILLIAM
D: You say that now - but when you're older? And our children are grown up? This won't last long. A year. Maybe two. And at the end of that - we'll we have everything we want. It's for our FUTURE.
E: comforting her a beat
C: MARY
D: ut can't you see? Do this, and we might not HAVE a future.
S: EXT. BOLEYN HOME - STABLES - DAY
N: MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang', walks straight into ANNE. A tense moment. The two SISTERS stare at one another..
C: MARY
D: I'm so sorry..
C: ANNE
D: What for? You think I want the King? Or to be used and abused by him? No! You're welcome to him. I have my own plans, which don't involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded.
E: puts on brave smile
N: MARY stares, saddened, `Oh, Anne', but there's no time to talk. She has to go. ANNE is left. Her eyes blazing.
S: EXT. PALACE - DAY
N: 7 37 MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates. MARY's face: as the heavy gates open. She shoots a last look at the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace gates. `CLANK', the heavy doors shut behind her. The outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'. mong them: is HENRY himself. He stares out of the window. Sees MARY. Then he lets the curtain fall.
S: INT. COURT - DAY
N: KATHERINE of ARAGON, (late-30's), imperious, intimidating, Spanish. Surrounded by other LADIES IN WAITING, (mostly high- born, Spanish, and the QUEEN's age). A SERVANT announces..
C: SERVANT
D: Mary Carey, Ma'am.
N: QUEEN KATHERINE looks up..`Who?'
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: Who?
C: SERVANT
D: The new Lady in Waiting.
N: P M
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: Really? But I was not expecting anyone.
C: ERVANT
D: Appointed by...his Majesty the King.
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: By my husband? Really?
N: The air crackles with tension. It's school bullying.
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: Well, then she must be some kind of gift. He must have seen in her some special talent that would please me. Tell me. What special talent is it that you have? with icy contempt) Apart from your obvious youth and beauty? errified, MARY stammers..
C: MARY
D: I...I..
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: oetry, perhaps?
C: MARY
D: N-no..
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: Or dressmaking?
C: MARY
D: I..I..
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: Music! That's it! You compose? Or sing?
C: MARY
D: ..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty.
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: Come, you're too modest. turns to a MUSICIAN) Signor Vasquez.
N: The Spanish GUITARIST obliges by starting to play a well-known tune of the period..
C: MARY
D: No..really..I beg you, your Majesty.
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: I command you to SING!!!
E: barks, suddenly terrifying
N: MARY flinches. Blushing deeply, her skin glowing with perspiration and terror, she begins to sing.. Normally she sings well. But her voice now is strangled with fear. MARY stands rigid, her knuckles whiten, nails digging into her hands, drawing blood. Finally, MARY finishes. The room is silent. All eyes on KATHERINE, who stares coldly. A formidable adversary.
C: QUEEN KATHERINE
D: Bravo! A nightingale! Welcome at court!
E: the cruel satisfaction of victory
S: INT. CORRIDORS - WHITEHALL PALACE - AFTERNOON
N: MARY walks through the packed corridors of court, her face burning from the humiliation. The sound of a voice behind her..
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: ait! Mary! Stop!
N: But MARY does not hear. She continues walking, distressed, and distractedly enters.. Finally, she is caught by JANE PARKER, whom we had seen at the window earlier. Younger, also English, a kindred spirit..
C: JANE
D: I know that must have been agony, but put yourself in her shoes. She knows the only reason the King has asked you here is because he desires you. For a wife that must be very difficult. a beat) She's a good woman. Trust me.
N: JANE smiles. MARY manages a smile.. ANE (cont'd) Jane Parker.
C: MARY
D: Mary Carey.
N: The two girls shake hands.
C: JANE
D: You have a brother, don't you? George?
C: MARY
D: Yes.
C: JANE
D: I've seen him a few times at court. And like him...very well. But I don't think he has noticed me.
E: a beat
C: MARY
D: I can't imagine. Should I mention you to him?
E: a beat
C: JANE
D: Would you?
C: MARY
D: Of course. Happily.
N: ANE PARKER smiles. But as soon as MARY's back is turned, the
T: smile fades.
S: EXT. TILTYARD - DAY
N: A large dusty yard, where KNIGHTS train for combat, and practise their fighting skills. MARY is with GEORGE, who is putting on his armour..
C: GEORGE
D: Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course I have. How could I not? She looks like a goat.
C: MARY
D: Well, she likes you, and asked me to give you this..to remember her by.
N: MARY hands over a handkerchief..
C: GEORGE
D: Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or that you forgot.
N: GEORGE hastily gives it back.. GEORGE (cont'd) There is something about that woman that makes me feel... (he shudders) GEORGE gets to his feet, indicates to his MALE COURTIER friend that he is coming..
C: MARY
D: And our sister? Any word?
C: GEORGE
D: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
C: MARY
D: Yes, I know.
C: GEORGE
D: And no amount of interventions on my behalf would make her believe you hadn't done it intentionally.
C: MARY
D: But you KNOW I would never do anything like that.
C: GEORGE
D: I know.
N: GEORGE finds his helmet, puts it on.. GEORGE (cont'd) Just give her time. She'll come round. MARY watches GEORGE go to join the other MALE COURTIERS.
S: INT. MARY'S ROOM - COURT - DAY
N: MARY enters her room, and closes the door. She begins undressing, taking off her clothes, then catches sight of a DOG in the shadows. She gasps. It's the KING's dog.
C: HENRY
D: Please, don't be alarmed.
E: O.S.
N: ENRY steps out of the shadows.. MARY covers herself in modesty, and falls to her knees in a deep curtsey of deference. HENRY steps into the light, walks towards her.. H
C: ENRY
D: I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so I might say a few words to you in person.
N: ENRY turns, looks around the room..
C: HENRY
D: I hope your accommodation is comfortable. I realise it's no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country.. But please, give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here..
E: a beat MORE
N: (a beat) NRY(cont'd)
C: HE
D: The moment I met you, I realised I..
N: HENRY tails off as MARY unbuttoning her dress..
C: HENRY
D: What are you..?
E: tailing off
N: MARY's dress comes off her shoulder. The KING's eyes, however, instead of staring at MARY's beautiful, exposed body, stay focused on her eyes. An uncomfortable moment..
C: HENRY
D: I am sorry. You obviously misunderstand me.
E: delicately putting her clothes back on MARY
N: HENRY bows in respect, then turns, and takes his leave, leaving MARY standing in the room..
S: INT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - NIGHT
N: The DUKE of NORFOLK stares in disbelief at MARY. His dogs lie intimidatingly at his feet.
C: NORFOLK
D: What? If all the King wanted was coition, he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. a beat) What he wants is YOU. a beat) To woo you. And be wooed in return. And could'nt you look just a little happier? There isn't a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn't wish to be in your shoes.
E: a beat
C: MARY
D: Your opinion, Uncle.
N: MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head..
C: MARY
D: Mine is that it's the greatest insult of all.
C: ORFOLK
D: What?
C: MARY
D: Asking a whore to have feelings, too.
N: WE'RE INTO A BRIEF MONTAGE:
S: INT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY
N: An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass, in Latin, for the Royal Household. he King sits at the front, on the left. With the men. The ladies are separated, as is traditional, and sit on the right. HENRY is lost in prayer. It's not long, however, before he turns to look at MARY.
S: EXT. COUNTRY CHAPEL - DAY
N: Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away. local PRIEST arrives. He sees two HORSES tethered to a tree by the side of the church. He dismounts. Checks no one has followed him. hen he enters the church.
S: INT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY
N: 5 45 In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood.. But, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues to stare at MARY. inally, she looks up. Their eyes meet. MARY blushes, averts her gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks back. This is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. Everyone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them can concentrate..
S: INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY
N: In the country church: The PRIEST's eyes become accustomed to the dark. Everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness..
C: PRIEST
D: Are you there?
N: Presently, a WOMAN steps into the light. It's ANNE. Dressed in a shawl.
C: PRIEST
D: No one saw you?
C: ANNE
D: No.
C: PRIEST
D: You brought the money.
N: ANNE hands over a purse of coins. They walk to the altar..
C: PRIEST
D: And the groom? Is he here?
N: Up ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see his face. It's HENRY PERCY.
C: RIEST
D: Good. Then let us begin.
S: EXT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY
N: Back at court: the service ends. Everyone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered.. The extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge evidenced by.. ..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected. MARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised at how good it feels. To be the number 1.
S: INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it. Presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes widen in excitement. The King? She hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away in a drawer. She gets out of bed. Anxiously straightens her hair, then goes to the door, to find.. GEORGE, her brother, who bursts in..
C: MARY
D: George? It's the middle of the night.
C: GEORGE
D: t's Anne.
C: MARY
D: hat?
C: GEORGE
D: he's married Henry Percy!
C: MARY
D: What?
E: horrified
C: GEORGE
D: In secret. Without telling anyone!
N: MARY's face falls..
C: MARY
D: Oh, no...!
C: GEORGE
D: tailing off) You don't look pleased.
C: MARY
D: Why would I be pleased?
C: GEORGE
D: It would make her the future Duchess of Northumberland. Our sister!
C: MARY
D: But they'll never allow it, don't you see? He's already precontracted to Mary Talbot, and if word of the consummation gets out her reputation will be ruined..
N: MARY pulls back her sheets..
C: MARY
D: ...I have to tell Father. Before it's too late..
C: GEORGE
D: What?
N: GEORGE watches MARY go to the door..
C: GEORGE
D: Mary..! Wait! Come back!
S: INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - BOLEYN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY
N: A FAMILY MEETING: ANNE and HENRY PERCY, (the HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN from Mary's wedding), stand in front of the DUKE of NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and GEORGE..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: What were you thinking? The marriage of a senior noble is a matter of state. Something only the King can decide..
N: HENRY PERCY looks down, avoiding eye contact..
C: NORFOLK
D: Who knows about this?
C: ANNE
D: No one.
C: NORFOLK
D: Then that is how it shall remain. Forever.
C: ANNE
D: But you cannot undo what has been done before God. And consummated too.
E: defiant stare
N: `Snap', NORFOLK's quill breaks. SIR THOMAS almost chokes. GEORGE's eyes widen..
C: NORFOLK
D: WHAT?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: There have been improper intimacies, too?
E: struggling to contain his anger
C: ANNE
D: I have lain with my husband. There is nothing improper about it..
C: NORFOLK
D: SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter I'd thrash you within an inch of your life..
N: ANNE recoils, terrified..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: The boy will return to Northumberland - where he will marry the Talbot girl. As arranged.
N: Y ( SIR THOMAS gives the signal for WILLIAM STAFFORD to escort PERCY out.
C: ORFOLK
D: As for you. You will go to France and stay there until you have learned your lesson.
C: MARY
D: What?
C: ORFOLK
D: How could you do this to your sister? You know full well her friendship with the King is at an extremely delicate stage. Any scandal or black mark against Mary's name now could be fatal.
N: SIR THOMAS dismisses her..
C: NORFOLK
D: You will join the court of the French Queen. And stay there until your father has forgiven you.
N: ANNE goes. GEORGE follows..
S: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE - DAY
N: MARY paces anxiously in the corridor. Presently, ANNE emerges from the room. Burning with humiliation. Their eyes meet. MARY is about to speak, but ANNE cuts her off..
C: ANNE
D: ou told them, didn't you? a beat) How COULD you?
C: MARY
D: Because you would never have got away with it. And it would have ruined your prospects forever. Believe me. I did it for your good.
E: a beat
C: ANNE
D: Really? For MY good? I'll try to remind myself of that. While I'm in exile. And you're here, in the King's bed, and unchallenged for our father's affection. a beat) That it was for MY good. Not yours.
C: MARY
D: ANNE, wait..!
N: ANNE storms out. GEORGE shoots MARY a look, "I'll deal with this", and runs after ANNE.. OVER THIS: we fade in MUSIC and the sound of laughter..
S: INT. BALL-ROOM - PALACE - NIGHT
N: 1 51 A grand MASQUE BALL. We're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom. MUSICIANS play. Large formations of DANCERS perform elaborately choreographed moves. Among them we pick out.. SIR THOMAS BOLEYN stalking the party. Ever watchful. On duty. Vigilant. He is distracted by the sight of... His son, GEORGE BOLEYN, surrounded by FRANCIS WESTON and his FRIENDS. GEORGE is clearly in his element. Laughing in delight. Very fond and intimate with FRANCIS WESTON.. SIR THOMAS looks concerned for the first time. n another corner, MARY is in costume, but looking forlorn. She watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. Presently, a voice behind her..
C: MASKED MAN
D: Why look so glum, Mary?
N: MARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her.
C: MARY
D: What reason have I to be happy?
C: MASKED MAN
D: ou have two men, the King of England and I, both fighting for your love.
N: The MASKED MAN is tall. His voice is quiet, but strong.
C: MARY
D: Do I know you?
C: MASKED MAN
D: You know me, Mary - but not half as well as I know you. I know you better than anyone here. And love you better than anyone here, too. And if God had made ME your husband instead of William Carey, one thing I know.. I would never have let you go.
E: a beat
T: MARY's smile fades..
C: MARY
D: Wait! Who ARE you?
N: B M MARY lunges for the MAN's MASK to try and remove it, but the MAN retreats into the safety of the shadows. Meanwhile.. All around MARY the crowds part, and a deep voice booms out. ASKED MAN #2 Ah! Who have we here?!? MARY turns to see a SECOND MASKED MAN, (unmistakably the KING), surrounded by COURTIERS.
C: MARY
D: My name is Kindness.
N: MASKED MAN #2 wonder, will you be kind to me?
C: MARY
D: What is it you desire?
N: MASKED MAN #2 our love, fair Lady.
C: MARY
D: You demand a great deal.
N: MASKED MAN #2 No more than I would give in return. MARY notices her FATHER is among the masked COURTIERS. His eyes giving MARY cues..
C: MARY
D: It is easy for a man to declare love from behind a mask.
N: ASKED MAN #2 ut if I remove it, you might reject me.
C: MARY
D: If your feelings were sincere, I would never reject you.
N: MASKED MAN #2 But you do not know who I am? I could be ugly. Or poor.
C: MARY
D: o matter how you looked. Or who you were.
N: MASKED MAN #2 Really? Then I shall hold you to your word. And unmask..! With a flourish, the KING rips off his mask..
C: MARY
D: Your Majesty..!
N: SIR THOMAS urgently nods, `Go on!' MARY theatrically swoons. Falling into the KING's arms. A gasp among the COURTIERS..
C: HENRY
D: he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms! Call my physicians..!
N: SIR THOMAS quickly picks MARY up. He carries her through the crowds, out of the ball-room.. QUEEN KATHERINE watches from a distance. A flicker of pain. Then, with great dignity and pride, she turns back to watch the entertainment..
S: INT. KING'S APARTMENT - COURT - NIGHT
N: `Thump', the doors open, and MARY is carried into the King's apartments. HENRY fusses, brings water. Opens windows.
C: ENRY
D: Go! Leave us! Go!
N: SIR THOMAS bows to the KING, shoots MARY meaningful look, `Don't fail me', and retreats. HENRY closes the doors. He and MARY are left alone. HENRY makes her comfortable.
C: MARY
D: Thank you, your Grace.
C: HENRY
D: `Henry', please. The first rule of this room, is to leave `Your Grace's' and `Your Majesty's' outside.
N: ENRY looks up..
C: HENRY
D: Is there anything I can bring you?
C: MARY
D: No.
C: HENRY
D: Nothing to increase your comfort or well- being?
C: MARY
D: You might ask your servants to bring me some water.
N: HENRY goes to get water himself..
C: HENRY
D: There. There ARE no servants.
N: MARY's eyes widen. The KING of ENGLAND brings her a drink! MARY takes a sip of her drink and watches as HENRY goes behind a screen and begins to remove his costume. His mask. MARY notices a mirror, and watches in the reflection of the mirror how HENRY removes the costume and status of KING and becomes a MAN. Private. ENRY visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. He breathes out deeply. His face becomes softer. More gentle. Then he puts on a comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen. HENRY goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down - and smiles at MARY.
C: MARY
D: So, this is it? This is where the King of England sleeps?
C: HENRY
D: And reads. And writes. And finds a few moments each day... ...for himself.
E: gestures
N: HENRY smiles at MARY.. HENRY (cont'd) You look surprised?
C: MARY
D: I am. I suppose it's more..
N: MARY looks at the bed, the books, the pages of writing on the desk..
C: MARY
D: ..simple than I imagined.
C: ENRY
D: There's no need for show. I am only ever here alone.
C: MARY
D: And yet you invite me here?
C: HENRY
D: Because I trust you.
C: MARY
D: You hardly know me.
C: HENRY
D: A man in my position develops an instinct. a beat) You would never lie, could never lie to me.
N: MARY smiles, admitting he's right.
C: MARY
D: No.
C: HENRY
D: I also sense...that you might relish an opportunity to be yourself, too.
C: MARY
D: Yes.
C: HENRY
D: Well, here you only say what you like, do what you like.
C: MARY
D: Very well.
N: MARY smiles. Stretches out her legs. Relaxes..
C: MARY
D: I'd like an apple, please.. ..Henry.
E: can't believe she's saying this
N: HENRY jumps to his feet, brings MARY an apple. MARY laughs, `Thank you'. Bites into the apple..
C: MARY
D: Now it's your turn.
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: MARY
D: To say something, or do something you couldn't outside.
C: HENRY
D: There are many things I cannot admit to in public. Sadness, for example. And loneliness.
C: MARY
D: But when you are loved as much as you are? How can you be lonely?
C: HENRY
D: Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage?
C: MARY
D: Yes. I do now.
C: ENRY
D: married my brother's widow because my father ordered it. As a duty. To keep the alliance with Spain. And she is a remarkable woman. And wife.
N: HENRY looks at MARY..
C: HENRY
D: But I never looked at her or longed for her the way I do you.
N: HENRY reaches out. Their hands meet..
C: HENRY
D: Imagine how different it might have been. For both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves..
N: HENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY resisting. Then harder.. ensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the canopied bed, and lays her down.. They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine.. MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets..
S: INT. PALACE - DAYBREAK
N: HENRY and MARY, entwined in one another's arms, as the sun rises...
S: INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HENRY'S APARTMENTS - DAY
N: Several hours later: WILLIAM STAFFORD is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor outside. Finally, the door opens. And MARY emerges from the KING's apartment.
C: TAFFORD
D: Good morning. TAFFORD jumps to his feet. Waking rapidly..
C: STAFFORD
D: I have orders to bring you to your father.
N: MARY stares at STAFFORD. As he straightens his shirt..
C: MARY
D: My father..? a beat) Well, we'd better not keep him waiting.
N: STAFFORD turns, leads the way. MARY follows.
S: INT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - DAY
N: The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by the fire. Slurping hungrily. The entire family is gathered. SIR THOMAS, LADY ELIZABETH. Also present is WILLIAM CAREY.
C: NORFOLK
D: Well..?
N: MARY stares at her husband..
C: NORFOLK
D: Did he have you?
N: MARY's eyes burn..
C: MARY
D: Yes.
C: NORFOLK
D: More than once?
N: MARY stares daggers..
C: NORFOLK
D: You'd better get used to talking about it. Once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more.
C: MARY
D: Yes. More than once.
N: WILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain..
C: NORFOLK
D: So he was satisfied?
C: MARY
D: I believe so, Uncle.
C: NORFOLK
D: ood. This is where our work begins. It's one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him.
N: NORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a piece of livestock..
C: NORFOLK
D: I want you to keep her spotless, hair washed every day. She must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion. She must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That's how he likes his women. And if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost killed her.
N: ut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from a palace window as, in a stableyard down below.. GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the stable-boys.. SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy between them..
T: SIR THOMAS's smile fades.
S: INT. PALACE - DAY
N: `Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a magnificent ship on a table. He sits with SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK.
C: HENRY
D: The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. ..I'd like to name her after your daughter. The "Mary Boleyn".
E: We notice SIR THOMAS's clothes have become more expensive, grander
N: SIR THOMAS looks up in disbelief..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Majesty! I'm...I'm speechless..
C: HENRY
D: onsense. She's an angel. It's the least she deserves. And if there's anything else I can do for YOU, my friend..as an expression of my gratitude..let me know.
N: SIR THOMAS's tails off. Thinking..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: s it happens..there is one thing.
C: HENRY
D: Name it.
N: SIR THOMAS has clearly not stopped thinking about what he saw between GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: ur son, George. He's of an age now..
C: HENRY
D: You want me to make him a match?
N: SIR THOMAS bows. Deadly serious..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Yes, your Majesty.
C: HENRY
D: Do you have anyone in mind?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: There is one lady, Sir..
C: HENRY
D: Go on..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Who I fear is too high-born for us. And following the unfortunate matter between Anne and Henry Percy, I didn't want my children to overreach themselves again..
C: HENRY
D: verreach themselves?
N: HENRY can't help smiling..
C: HENRY
D: One is currently in the King's bed. If they are good enough for me, I suggest they're good enough for anyone else. So.. Who is it?
E: gestures
N: OVER THIS: we hear GEORGE's distraught voice..
C: GEORGE
D: Jane Parker..?
E: O.S.
S: INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - LONDON - DAY
N: GEORGE BOLEYN, visibly shocked and distressed, stands in front of his father.
C: EORGE
D: I beg you, Father. No.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: She's well connected, her father is cousin to the King. And there's money, too.
C: GEORGE
D: But must I actually...marry her?
N: SIR THOMAS's expression changes..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: thought you had ambitions for this family. G
C: EORGE
D: I do.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: And that you wish to make a contribution yourself. Not just stand back and watch your sisters.
N: EORGE nods..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Then my advice would be to start behaving like a man. A real man. Do I make myself clear?
N: SIR THOMAS walks out. GEORGE stares after him..
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, Sir.
E: quiet
S: INT. BALL-ROOM - PARKER FAMILY CASTLE - NIGHT
N: MUSICIANS play. We're at GEORGE's wedding. Attended by the KING and QUEEN, all the senior LORDS. It's a markedly grander and posher affair than MARY's earlier wedding, a clear indication of the BOLEYNS' new, elevated status. A formation dance is in progress. At the centre of it: GEORGE dances with a radiant, triumphant JANE PARKER. GEORGE's eyes meet those of FRANCIS WESTON across the room. y contrast: HENRY dances with MARY. A couple with eyes on for each other. Locked to one another. Blissfully unaware of and uninterested in anyone else. Silently counting the minutes before they can tear off one another's clothes.. EVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: Their intimacy is witnessed by WILLIAM CAREY, who we notice is now drinking heavily, drowning his jealous sorrows.. ELSEWHERE: SIR THOMAS BOLEYN is dancing with his wife, LADY ELIZABETH. He hisses through a fixed smile..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: For God's sake, it's the wedding of our youngest child attended by the King of England and the greatest Lords in the Land. Would a smile be too much to ask?
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: What's to smile about? I'm a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like he's been condemned to death.
N: he indicates GEORGE, who dances with JANE PARKER..
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: Another banished abroad, in disgrace. And a third whoring in public with an adulterer.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: For the moment she's happy.
N: SIR THOMAS watches MARY who dances with the KING..
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: But will she be happy when he leaves her? Because you know that's how it will end.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Only God knows how anything will end.
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: God..? He turned his back on all this a long time ago.
N: SIR THOMAS stares coldly at his wife. He applauds as the dance comes to an end. IN ANOTHER CORNER: MARY and the KING also clap. HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side... MARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly.
C: WILLIAM
D: You're in love with him, aren't you?
C: MARY
D: illiam, you're drunk.
C: WILLIAM
D: How is it? With him?
N: MARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him.
C: MARY
D: He pleases me. Is that what you want to hear?
C: WILLIAM
D: What does he do to you? Tell me. I want to know..
N: MARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY sees this from across the room..
C: WILLIAM
D: I know you look at me with contempt. But I had no choice. Your father insisted I stand aside. What was I expected to do?
C: MARY
D: Say `no', husband. That was all you had to do.
E: a beat
N: MARY pulls her arm away, and goes. She walks across the room, visibly shaken, and joins the KING.
S: INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: 9 59 HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of themselves.. Hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms. MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms. She lovingly strokes his hair. Watches him breathe. Her face is glowing. Content. And the look in her eyes tells us more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet.. ...that she has fallen in love.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - COURT - DAY
N: The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open door, we see MARY hunched over her basin, vomiting. resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands instinctively covering her belly. MARY's eyes widen with the implications.
S: INT. KING'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK stare at MARY. Also present are several PHYSICIANS and GEORGE BOLEYN..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Are you certain?
C: MARY
D: Yes.
N: SIR THOMAS looks at the PHYSICIAN, who nods..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: n that case...I suppose...someone should tell the King.
S: INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Shooting through a half-open door.. SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK are having a private audience with the KING. SIR THOMAS whispers something in HENRY's ear.. (WE DO NOT HEAR THE WORDS - WE DO NOT NEED TO). HENRY's face breaks out in a smile. He delightedly shakes SIR THOMAS's hand. OVER THIS: the sound of a voice..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Keep them shut...still shut..
E: O.S.
S: INT. COURT - ACCOMMODATION - DAY
N: A blindfolded MARY is led through doors by SIR THOMAS..into a suite of grand, unfurnished rooms, the most prestigious accommodation at court..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Now open!
N: MARY removes her blindfold. She gasps in disbelief, turns 360 degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: There's more. Thanks to you, I am to become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount.
N: EORGE smiles at MARY, who's eyes widen.. SIR THOMAS (cont'd) In addition, we have received a number of new grants and estates. pointedly, to LADY
C: ELIZABETH)
D: So our debts are paid off.
N: But LADY ELIZABETH remains granite-faced..
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: Just be aware. These `gifts', this `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes. These rooms belonged to the Duke of Buckingham. Once the King's closest friend. Now his head rots on a spike..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Because he committed treason.
C: ADY ELIZABETH
D: But what is `treason'? It's anything the King or his lawyers decide it to be. Anything that offends him, or causes him displeasure. a beat) And can you assure me we'll never do that?
N: LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. MARY looks anxiously at SIR THOMAS, who gestures dismissively..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Pay her no heed..
S: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: MARY wakes up. She gets out of bed. She goes to the window and draws the curtains. Then MARY looks down, and gasps. The floor has fresh drops of blood on it. MARY goes to her bed, and rips back the sheets. Her eyes widen in horror. There is blood all over the sheets. MARY covers her mouth. Lets out a loud cry. The sound of approaching footsteps as SERVANTS come running..
S: INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: MARY lies on the bed being examined by several PHYSICIANS. SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK look on in concern. Finally, the PHYSICIAN turns, washing his hands..
C: PHYSICIAN
D: Happily, the baby lives. She's not miscarried. SIR THOMAS's face. Overcome with relief..
C: PHYSICIAN
D: But the placenta is weak. For the sake of the child..
N: The PHYSICIAN clears his throat. This will not be easy..
C: PHYSICIAN
D: She must begin her lying-in immediately.
C: MARY
D: What?
E: horrified
N: MARY looks up. Her heart sinks.
C: MARY
D: But I'm only three months..
S: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - COURT - DAY
N: MARY lies in her bed, watching with a forlorn expression as MIDWIVES and MAIDS prepare the apartment for lying-in. APESTRIES with soothing biblical images are hung on the walls. CURTAINS are drawn for darkness. A large CRUCIFIX is placed in a corner. As each TAPESTRY is hung, the room becomes darker... ..and darker. ..and darker. MARY cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as possible, but before long.. ..her face slips into darkness, and the room into total silence. And effective imprisonment.
S: INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Darkness. The KING stands at the foot of MARY's bed. He is clearly uncomfortable in these `maternal' surroundings..
C: HENRY
D: ou poor girl. All alone in here. But the time will fly by.
C: MARY
D: Will it? It's six months?
C: HENRY
D: I know. But the most important thing is a healthy child.
N: ENRY takes MARY's hand.. HENRY (cont'd) I'll come and see you as often as I can. I promise. ENRY kisses MARY, then goes. 8 68
S: INT. COURT - DAY
N: The KING's birthday. The MASTER OF REVELS has organised a lavish ball. The entire court is assembled and dancing, but HENRY appears sullen, distant. Unable to celebrate. He misses MARY. he QUEEN has several of her prettiest SPANISH LADIES-IN WAITING surrounding the KING. Giggling, fragrant butterflies. But HENRY shows no interest. The DUKE of NORFOLK notices this. A flicker of concern.
S: EXT. GARDENS - DAY
N: An archery competition is in progress. But HENRY pays no attention. He sits listlessly to one side. Ill-tempered and missing MARY. mong the GUESTS are SIR JOHN SEYMOUR and his CHILDREN. They notice the KING, all alone. They talk among themselves. Sensing an opportunity, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR advances, and presents his pretty daughter JANE to the KING. The DUKE of NORFOLK, (never far away), notices how modestly and demurely young JANE SEYMOUR flirts. She has been well trained. But she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away. Not remotely interested. or the moment.
S: INT. MARY'S ROOM - LYING-IN - EVENING
N: The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands and are talking intimately. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: This is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding..
C: NORFOLK
D: For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs.
N: NORFOLK looks up...
C: NORFOLK
D: What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is absent.
N: SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind.
C: NORFOLK
D: What? Speak..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: It's just...I was going to suggest Anne.
C: NORFOLK
D: You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now?
C: SIR THOMAS
D: I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed.
S: INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..
C: MARY
D: Why?
N: Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE..
C: GEORGE
D: I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough.
C: MARY
D: But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else.
C: GEORGE
D: They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance.
C: MARY
D: But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine.
N: GEORGE turns, looks all around him.. GEORGE (cont'd) Why DO they make this room such a dungeon? Does it really need to be this dark? GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression..
C: GEORGE
D: Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. Besides, the most important thing is..
E: a beat
N: GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape..
C: GEORGE
D: The three of us will be together again.
N: MARY's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile..
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: EXT. KENT COUNTRYSIDE - COAST - DAY
N: The thunder of galloping horses. alf a dozen RIDERS, among them a HOODED WOMAN, riding side- saddle, tearing across the countryside..
S: EXT. VILLAGES - DAY
N: The RIDERS and the WOMAN gallop through villages, spraying mud. VILLAGERS stop and stare.. A MOTHER pulls a child out of the path of the RIDERS.
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
N: The RIDERS and the WOMAN ride in silhouette against a perfect full moon..
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: HENRY and several of his COURTIERS return from a hunting trip. Several dead STAGS are carried on horseback. The atmosphere is celebratory. It's been a good day. Dogs bark in excitement.
S: INT. GREENWICH PALACE - THAT NIGHT
N: A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the table, loud laughter. ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation. It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his conversation. resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time, HENRY loses patience..
C: HENRY
D: What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think!
N: At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet..
C: BRANDON
D: It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing.
N: HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent..
C: HENRY
D: I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly!
N: SIR THOMAS BOLEYN gets to his feet..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: It's my elder daughter, Anne, your Majesty. She has returned to court.
C: HENRY
D: What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one that almost killed me? You allowed her back?
E: a beat
C: SIR THOMAS
D: The time abroad has done her good, your Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much improved.
C: HENRY
D: Really..?
N: HENRY looks down the table..
C: HENRY
D: Well, come on. Where are you, other Boleyn girl? Show your face.
N: ANNE slowly gets to her feet. HENRY looks up. When he sees ANNE's face, his face falls.. ANNE is a woman transformed. Gone are the simple clothes, puppy fat and lack of confidence. ANNE has become a glorious, head-turning siren; dressed in daring French clothes. er hood is half-crescent, and reveals the hair. Her neckline plunges sexily. Her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring flashes of arm and elbow.. Like every other red-blooded MAN in the room, HENRY is utterly mesmerised. Speechless..
C: HENRY
D: So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we might hear and judge for ourselves?
N: ANNE dark, intelligent eyes stare back at HENRY. Suddenly, all sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though they are the only two people in the room..
C: ANNE
D: I was just giving my thoughts on the new French King.
C: HENRY
D: Which are..?
C: ANNE
D: That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.
C: HENRY
D: Hah!
C: ANNE
D: And is SO consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think.
C: HENRY
D: eally? And who is this rival?
C: ANNE
D: A neighbouring King, who's name one is forbidden to mention at court. Whose reputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams.
N: ipples of laughter, as people guess..
C: ANNE
D: Whose armies and navy thwart his every endeavour. Whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and wide.
N: ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..
C: ANNE
D: In order to restore his confidence, this French King spends a fortune on anything that glitters, on building of castles with large towers..
N: ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..
C: ANNE
D: But these symbols of wealth and virility fail to convince. Talk among the ladies at court in France suggests.. ANNE stops herself...
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: ANNE
D: That in this department too, the King has his shortcomings.
N: ANNE's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). HENRY stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far? Then HENRY smiles. Delighted. DOGS bark in bewilderment. Soon everyone in the room laughs too. xcept for the SEYMOURS, (SIR JOHN and his sons, EDWARD and THOMAS), who glower, mute, at the end of the table beside their sister JANE..
S: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: SIR THOMAS beams with excitement and satisfaction...
C: SIR THOMAS
D: You should have seen the Seymours! Their faces!
N: MARY lies in bed. Sitting by her side is her father..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: They must have thought that with you out of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale-faced thing of theirs, Jane...
N: SIR THOMAS smiles as he remembers.. SIR THOMAS (cont'd) But Anne put pay to that. Last night, the King only had eyes for us Boleyns. MARY shoots a private, knowing look..
C: MARY
D: Or HER, you mean.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: What?
C: MARY
D: 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you.
C: MARY
D: Really?
N: MARY stares hollow-eyed.. MARY (cont'd) Then ask yourself this. If she is really so concerned for my well-being... (a beat) (MORE) ...then why hasRY(conot dcome to see me MA she nt' ) since she returned?
S: EXT. TILTYARD - DAY
N: HENRY and several of his closest COURTIERS are sparring close- combat sword fighting. It's tough, physical, no-holds barred stuff..
S: INT. ARMOURY - DAY
N: 9 79 AFTERWARDS: HENRY and his COURTIERS, (among them GEORGE), are being undressed and washed by their PAGES and SQUIRES..
C: HENRY
D: You're a fortunate man, George. To be blessed with G two such sisters.
C: EORGE
D: Yes, my Lord.
N: There is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE.
C: ENRY
D: Tell me. Are they as different in temper as they are in looks?
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct virtues. Mary for example..
C: HENRY
D: I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about Anne's.
C: GEORGE
D: Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say `difficult'.
C: ENRY
D: Headstrong. With a fiery temper.
C: GEORGE
D: But with it comes great passion, too. It's both the best and the worst thing about her. a beat) There are no half measures with Anne.
C: HENRY
D: Careful, you'll make me think I chose the wrong Boleyn girl.
N: 8 A
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the right choice. You will have a serene, happy, life with her. The risk is with Anne, it might be like being caught in a wild summer storm.
C: HENRY
D: Is that so..?
N: GEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the wrong thing.
C: HENRY
D: storm, you say..?
S: INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - COURT - FOLLOWING DAY
N: 0 80 A small, precious-looking GIFT BOX sits on a table.
C: ERVANT
D: From the King, madam.
N: ANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the unmistakable royal seal.
C: ANNE
D: Open it.
N: A SERVANT stares..
C: ANNE
D: I said `open it.'
N: The SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps. ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful.. But from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..
C: ANNE
D: Now close it again. And send it back.
N: The SERVANT stares in disbelief.. ANNE (cont'd) You heard me. The SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a look of mischief in her eyes. She's up to no good.
S: INT. KING'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: The SERVANT nervously stands in front of the KING, holding the box..
C: HENRY
D: She did what?
C: SERVANT
D: Sent it back, your Grace.
N: HENRY's face. Confounded..
C: HENRY
D: Sent it back?
S: EXT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY
N: A ROYAL MESSENGER, in the King's livery, holding a larger, more expensive looking GIFT BOX, walks towards the Boleyn house..
S: INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY
N: ANNE shakes her head, and sends the gift back. She looks anxious. Knows this is a high risk game she's playing.
S: INT. KING'S APARTMENTS - DAY
N: The MESSENGER stands in front of the KING, holding the rejected BOX in his hands..
C: HENRY
D: What? Again?
S: EXT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY
N: The same ROYAL MESSENGER walks towards the BOLEYN house. This time holding an even larger, more expensive-looking GIFT..

T: fades.
S: INT. CORRIDORS - COURT - DAY
N: `Crash', the KING, flanked by several of his most intimidating COURTIERS, bursts through doors, and storms along a corridor. It's an impressive sight.. People scatter to get out of the way.
S: INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - COURT - DAY
N: The KING bursts in. Everyone leaps to their feet. SERVANTS stop and stare and curtsey. LADY ELIZABETH bows, clearly thrown..
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: Your Majesty.
N: HENRY turns full circle, looking for someone..
C: HENRY
D: Your daughter. Where is she?
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: Mary..?
C: HENRY
D: Anne!
S: INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY
N: ANNE hears the KING's voice. Her eyes widen. She looks down. Sees HENRY. ANNE smiles privately - it's confirmation that her strategy has worked. t that moment, HENRY sees her, calls out, `Anne!'. ANNE's smile
T: fades.

C: ANNE
D: On the contrary, my Lord. They pleased me greatly.
C: HENRY
D: Then why did you return them?
N: Now ANNE opens the door. She appears wearing a stunning outfit..
S: INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY
N: ANNE steps into the corridor. Closes the door behind her.
C: ANNE
D: ecause my sister lies in bed with your child. If you wish to please me, Sir, then send her the gifts you send me.
C: HENRY
D: I have shown Mary enough kindness and generosity. It's you I want, Anne.
C: ANNE
D: beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What has changed so?
C: HENRY
D: YOU. Don't you see? YOU have changed.
C: ANNE
D: But Mary is still the mother of your child. And even if she weren't..

S: INT. SIR THOMAS'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
N: SIR THOMAS is asleep. The sound of voices. A commotion outside. The sound of banging on his door..
C: STAFFORD
D: Sir Thomas! It's Mary..!
S: INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: 5 95 MARY cries out in pain. The contractions become stronger. MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS urgently do their business. Pots of boiling water. Primitive surgical instruments. PRIEST arrives, ready to perform the last rites..
S: INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: The DUKE of NORFOLK, SIR THOMAS, and GEORGE BOLEYN arrive in MARY's bedroom, and stare anxiously as the labour begins in earnest..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Does the King know?
C: GEORGE
D: He's on his way.
N: ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress. MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way. Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair.. No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands. PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments.. Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Any moment, your Grace.
N: But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands beside her.. All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE might as well be in a rose garden..
C: HENRY
D: Anne..
N: ANNE stares ahead at MARY's bed..
C: HENRY
D: Anne, I love you..
C: ANNE
D: Your Grace, this is not the time..

D: I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking about you. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep..

N: NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen..
C: ANNE
D: When I have seen how you have betrayed first your wife. And now my sister.
N: HENRY takes ANNE to one side...
C: HENRY
D: I vow from this moment forth I will never lie with my wife, or speak to your sister again. I will do anything you ask..
N: MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then..
C: ANNE
D: Then don't acknowledge the child.
N: HENRY is thrown..
C: HENRY
D: What?
N: With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see..
C: PHYSICIAN
D: A boy!
N: SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness..
C: SIR THOMAS
D: It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong, healthy boy.
N: HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he has waited for. A son. ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again..
C: ANNE
D: What my sister has given you, I could, too.
N: HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are full of conflict, then..he silently nods. ANNE's face breaks out in a smile..
C: ANNE
D: Very well.
N: Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is, HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it. The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand..
C: MARY
D: Henry..?
E: a dagger in her heart
N: HENRY gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without looking in the direction of MARY or the BABY. MARY (cont'd) My Lord..? MARY stares after the KING, but he does not turn around. Instead, MARY's eyes meet ANNE's. ANNE's eyes stare back. The ultimate moment of revenge. barely perceptible smile of satisfaction, then ANNE turns and goes. The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly embarrassed by what they have just witnessed. The clearing of throats, averting of eyes. Then they get on with their work to the sound of the MARY's cries..
S: INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - NIGHT
N: `Crash', SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst into the study, angrily slamming the door closed behind them. ANNE is inside.
C: NORFOLK
D: Damn you! Three years we've been working on this! Not a single detail was left to chance! And now, in the moment of our greatest glory..
N: NORFOLK stares at ANNE..
C: NORFOLK
D: All I can say is you'd better have a plan. And it had better work.
N: ANNE stares back defiantly..
C: ANNE
D: Or what...Uncle?
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do about Mary? And the child? Or have we forgotten them already?
C: ANNE
D: Mary should go back to her husband.
N: Not a flicker of emotion on her face.
C: ANNE
D: She has been inconvenienced long enough by this family.
C: ADY ELIZABETH
D: Fine. Then you can be the one to tell her.
N: ADY ELIZABETH stares at ANNE..
C: LADY ELIZABETH
D: I think you've earned that privilege.
N: LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. ANNE's smile fades.

S: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
N: 9 99 ANNE stares into the room through a crack in the doorway. A flicker of doubt. What has she done? To her own sister? ANNE checks herself. Enough sentiment. She swallows it. nd enters.
S: INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: 00 100 MARY looks up as ANNE enters, and freezes..
C: MARY
D: How can you show your face in here?
C: ANNE
D: I understand you're angry - but be assured. I did nothing, except remind him of you.
C: MARY
D: Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately. As revenge. And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done.
E: a beat
C: ANNE
D: Well, hasn't it?
C: MARY
D: Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from my experience. Because he'll only do to you what he has done to me.
C: ANNE
D: Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm a greater thing by far. That he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer.
C: MARY
D: You'll never get Henry Percy back, if that's what you mean.
C: ANNE
D: That's not what I mean.
N: ANNE's eyes burn with anger..
C: ANNE
D: And don't you ever mention his name to me again. I'll never forget how you betrayed me.
C: MARY
D: If that's what you think, fine. Tell yourself that.
C: ANNE
D: I did, sister. Every day for three years.
N: ANNE turns, and walks out.
S: EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
N: MARY is leaving COURT. Pale. Weak. Her belongings have been packed into boxes. Ahead of her, the BABY is being carried by MIDWIVES, led by WILLIAM STAFFORD. MARY walks across a courtyard, then stops in her tracks. VER BY THE STABLES: the KING and ANNE are mounting horses to go riding together. HENRY lifts ANNE up into the saddle behind him, (how she has learned!). ANNE holds tight, her arms wrapped around his waist.. At that moment, ANNE looks over and sees MARY. Their eyes meet. They stare for a beat, then.. ANNE kicks HENRY's horse, `Hah!', and they ride out. Galloping into the distance. MARY's face: fighting to hold onto her dignity. WILLIAM STAFFORD watches her, his eyes burning with sympathy. REVERSE ANGLE: to reveal, this is all being watched by QUEEN KATHERINE, from a palace window above.. QUEEN KATHERINE turns, and coldly lets the curtain drop..
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: MARY and her entourage travel through the countryside in a small caravan of horses and wagons. It's raining heavily.
S: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
N: The rain continues. MARY's carriage approaches the manor house. At one time this was everything she wanted. Now it's a prison.
S: INT. MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
N: MARY sits at the dinner table with her husband, WILLIAM CAREY, who's health has deteriorated. He drinks heavily. A shadow of his former self. He stares at the BABY..
C: WILLIAM
D: Have you christened the child?
C: MARY
D: Henry.
C: WILLIAM
D: I see.
N: A painful smile..
C: WILLIAM
D: And is he to take my name? Or is he to be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast...
C: MARY
D: He is to be Henry Carey.
C: WILLIAM
D: I see.
N: A silence, then..
C: WILLIAM
D: Well, then, here we are.
N: WILLIAM stares at MARY. Clearly still in love with her.

E: a beat
N: MARY's face. Manages a brave smile.
S: INT. CAREY'S HOUSE - COURT - NIGHT
N: MARY lies in bed, her eyes open and staring blankly at the moon outside, as WILLIAM CAREY makes love to her. After a short, frenzied thrashing..he climaxes, then as before, rolls over and falls asleep. MARY stares at the ceiling. ADE TO BLACK:
S: EXT. PALACE - SUMMER

S: EXT. GARDENS - DAY

D: Well, I have done what you asked. Will you give yourself to me, now?
C: ANNE
D: As what?
C: HENRY
D: My one true mistress. To whom I am loyal above all others?
C: ANNE
D: But it's not true. You are loyal to the QUEEN above all others.
C: HENRY
D: My wife? I barely see her.
C: ANNE
D: But she sits on a throne beside you. Accompanies you to every state function.
C: ENRY
D: For appearance sakes only. In every other regard, our marriage is a sham.
C: ANNE
D: Still, she is your WIFE. And ever present. And I feel her eyes on me. And those of her spies.
N: ANNE nervously looks left and right..
C: ANNE
D: And look at us. Forever reduced to meeting in secret like this. Speaking in whispers. a beat) Hardly conducive to passion?
C: HENRY
D: Well, what would you have me do?
S: INT. COURT - DAY
N: ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to WOLSEY. We do not hear their dialogue, but the two MEN are having a heated discussion. Voices are raised. WOLSEY pleads with the KING to be reasonable. HENRY silences him angrily, then walks out..
S: INT. COURT - ANNE'S APARTMENTS - WINTER - DAY
N: ANNE enters a lavish drawing-room, and sits down. She picks up a book, and pretends to be reading. HENRY enters, sidles up behind ANNE, putting his arms around her, then..
C: HENRY
D: Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the Queen to be sent to a nunnery.
N: HENRY kisses ANNE on the neck..
C: HENRY
D: She will protest, of course. She won't go quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her exile. HENRY kisses ANNE) Which leaves you all alone at court..
N: He begins to unbutton her dress..
C: HENRY
D: ...queen in all but name. Mother to any future heir.
N: ENRY unbuttons and kisses lower, lower.
C: HENRY
D: So, is this assurance enough? Will you give yourself to me now?
N: A flicker behind ANNE's eyes, then..
C: ANNE
D: I'd like to. But I'm afraid I find the insult too much to bear.
C: HENRY
D: What insult?
N: B (
C: ANNE
D: Because as long as we remain unmarried, any child I gave you would forever be daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'.
C: ENRY
D: ut what alternative is there? throws hands up in exasperation) My love for the Queen may have died, but even you must concede, she is still very much alive. A
C: ANNE
D: Katherine of Aragon is alive. That woman is not worthy of the title `Queen'.
C: ENRY
D: Oh, Anne.
C: ANNE
D: I really do not know why we waste time talking of convents when you could annul the marriage.
C: HENRY
D: Annul it?
C: ANNE
D: That woman married two brothers and therefore sinned against God.
C: HENRY
D: But she never consummated the marriage with my brother.
C: ANNE
D: They were married six months.
C: HENRY
D: Arthur was a sick man.
C: ANNE
D: And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that her position as Queen would never be safe until she bedded your brother. Talk to your advisers. They will tell you as much.

C: ANNE
D: But that's wonderful.
N: ANNE's smiles, then notices..
C: ANNE
D: Why do you look sad?
C: HENRY
D: Because she will contest it. Which means putting her on trial. And hearing these delicate matters in public.
C: ANNE
D: es. But any court made up of YOUR Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour. And declare the marriage invalid.
N: Now it's ANNE's turn to start kissing HENRY round the neck..
C: ANNE
D: hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to remarry. Then I can give myself to you fully. kissing him lower, lower..) And give you everything you.. ..desire.

C: MARY
D: Please be sure to thank them - though one wonders what's kept them so busy that not a single one of them found time to visit the new baby.
C: STAFFORD
D: It's Anne. She's turning this country on its head. She has persuaded the king to test the validity of his marriage, and put the QueenM on trial.
C: MARY
D: What?
C: STAFFORD
D: She continues to hold out. Expertly witholding her favours until...
C: MARY

C: STAFFORD
D: ow is your husband? I heard he was unwell.
C: MARY
D: He is.
C: STAFFORD
D: I'm sorry.
N: STAFFORD stares at her. Their eyes meet. STAFFORD opens his mouth, for a moment it looks as if he's about to finally declare his feelings, then..
C: WILLIAM
D: Mary..!
E: O.S.
N: WILLIAM CAREY's voice calls out from inside. STAFFORD's expression changes. Now's not the right time. He kicks his horse, and rides off.

C: ANNE
D: Then what troubles you?
C: HENRY
D: One or two friends have refused to lend their support. Among them, Thomas More. And then there's the small matter of my conscience.
E: a beat
C: ANNE
D: Why? You have justice on your side.
N: HENRY stares, conflicted..
C: HENRY
D: Do I?
N: ANNE strokes his head. Pacifying him. But the look on her face tells us - this is getting harder and harder.
S: INT. HENRY'S QUARTERS - COURT - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
N: HENRY sits at breakfast. Reading official correspondence. Legal documents. And private letters. e sorts through the various scrolls, matters of state, then finds one. A letter in a hand he does not recognise. A quizzical look. HENRY cracks the seal and begins to reads the letter. Presently, his expression changes. Then his face darkens ominously.

E: MORE
N: You want me toUEEN KATHERINE(cont'd) Q retire and withdraw my daughter's claim as sole rightful heir to the throne? Well I shall not.

She makes no reply to the CRIER, instead walks over to where the KING sits, and falls onto her knees.. MARY looks at ANNE, who is visibly shaking. And tries to compose herself. Throughout the courtroom, people exchange looks. Gasp. KATHERINE is completely disregarding the court, Campeggio and Wolsey, and appealing directly to her husband..
C: KATHERINE
D: My Lord, how have I offended you? For twenty years, I have been a true, obedient wife. I have loved all those whom you loved, and given you children though it has pleased God to take them away. If there is any just cause that you can allege against me, I will happily depart to my shame and dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my witness, there is none.

C: SIR THOMAS
D: But they are continuing with the trial. And the Bishops will still find in the King's favour.
C: ANNE
D: Yes. But without the Pope's blessing, the result will seem hollow. a frustrated gesture) If only the King would take matters into his own hands.
C: ADY ELIZABETH
D: And do what? His only option would be to reject the Catholic Church? And his faith would never allow it.
C: SIR THOMAS
D: Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome would isolate England politically. Leave us at the mercy of the Protestants.
C: ANNE
D: But the alternative is leaving this country without an heir. Failing in his duty as a King. And risking civil war.
N: ANNE stops thinks.. ANNE (cont'd) omehow I need to make him understand that it is a fair price for a legitimate heir. ANNE looks at MARY.. ANNE (cont'd) One he could hold in his arms..

C: STAFFORD
D: Mary...I love you. There..I've said it. From the moment I joined your family..

C: ANNE
D: God, I look hideous.
C: EORGE
D: Does it hurt?
C: ANNE
D: Little nips and stabs.
N: MARY isn't listening. She is lost in thought.
C: GEORGE
D: Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt to the next King of England.
C: ANNE
D: But if it isn't? The King will take that as evidence of God's displeasure. And will turn further against me. He's already become so cold.
N: ANNE touches her stomach anxiously..
C: ANNE
D: They say you can tell by the shape of the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy or girl?
N: ANNE tails off when she sees MARY. Miles away.

D: Well done...

C: SIR THOMAS
D: Perfectly, Sir.
N: HENRY stares, hollow-eyed. Finally..
C: ENRY
D: Well, if we can have a healthy daughter, we can have a healthy son.
N: HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and leaves. ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking.. MARY stares at ANNE. A stab of compassion. Not long ago the same thing happened to her. Hoping to console ANNE, MARY hands her beautiful new BABY over to her... ..ANNE takes the BABY in her arms. Filled with love for something that will almost certainly mean her destruction. Her shoulders shake with tears.
T: FADE TO BLACK:

C: MARY
D: Lady Somerset, I believe.
C: ANNE
D: Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador. The day before with the Countess of Salisbury. How could he DO that to me? So SOON?
E: a frustrated gesture
N: ANNE stares at MARY..
C: ANNE
D: Now I know how it must have been for you.

S: INT. MARY'S ROOM - COURT - NIGHT

E: O.S.
N: SLAP', the sound of someone being struck.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: ANNE and MARY are together. ANNE is combing her hair. Strands of it come loose in her hands. Her eyes are hollow with stress. Her skin pale and covered in a film of perspiration..
C: ANNE
D: I struck him today. What am I doing? I am destroying this all on my own..
N: ANNE looks left and right. Makes sure no one is within earshot. Goes to check outside her door, then returns..
C: ANNE
D: I can't sleep at night! And without sleep I cannot think!
C: MARY
D: Oh, Anne..
C: ANNE
D: nd it's getting more and more difficult to arouse him. Some nights he cannot do it...at all. I have to resort to ever more disgusting...then he hates himself in the morning...hates me even more for what I made him do...
N: ANNE eyes stare. She rocks back and forth..
C: ANNE
D: It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it.

C: SIR THOMAS
D: And..?
N: The PHYSICIAN's face: he nods.
S: EXT. RIVER THAMES - WINTER PARTY - MONTHS LATER - DAY
N: A magnificent winter party to celebrate ANNE's pregnancy. The River Thames is frozen over. It's a lavish spectacle. Jousting on ice-skates, bear-baiting with dogs, MUSICIANS, skate- dancing, sledges and fire-eaters and Muscovite tumblers. The KING threads his way through COURTIERS and ENTERTAINERS. Wherever he goes, people stop their conversations, bow in fear. Inimidated. ANNE, visibly pregnant, sits on a throne. Alone. She looks drawn, frightened, and tired. An unmistakable echo of QUEEN KATHERINE at the masked ball earlier.
C: EORGE
D: And so, it's come to this. Our sister is with child, and all England's fate is in the balance.
N: EORGE indicates ANNE.. GEORGE (cont'd) If it's a boy, the King will have been vindicated in getting rid of his first wife, and his authority will be unassailable. But if it isn't. Or if, God forbid, she miscarries. EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark, malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.
C: GEORGE
D: The King will have to move swiftly to silence his enemies. He will claim innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by someone more `acceptable'. And we Boleyns will never be able to show our faces at court again.
E: a beat
C: MARY
D: That's no bad thing.
N: MARY shudders to herself. Holds her children protectively.
C: MARY
D: Anyone with any sense would have run away from this hell-hole already. As far as they could go.
C: GEORGE
D: ike the wise William Stafford.
N: MARY turns...
C: MARY

D: You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left for the country. Just like that. Gone to live in some place called..
C: MARY
D: ..Tatton.
E: under her breath
C: GEORGE
D: Where he grew up, apparently. Did you know he came from a better stable than all of us? His grandmother was a Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he never mentioned it. Who'd have guessed?
E: shrugs
N: EORGE shrugs, and skates off with FRANCIS WESTON. We pull back to reveal they are being watched by JANE PARKER.. ..who looks drained. Lonely. Worn out by the humiliation of her failed marriage and the agony of unrequited love.
S: INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: `HAAARRGGH', ANNE bolts awake in the middle of the night. Her face is pale. She is covered in a thin film of perspiration. She flinches in pain. Holding her stomach.. Immediately doors open, and several SERVANTS and LADIES appear. But ANNE composes herself.
C: ANNE
D: I'm fine, thank you. Just a bad dream.
E: visibly paranoid
N: Reassured, the SERVANTS fill ANNE's glass with water..
C: ANNE
D: But fetch my brother and sister, will you?
E: flinches as she speaks

S: INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - COURT - NIGHT
N: MARY and GEORGE arrive breathlessly in ANNE's room, to find.. ANNE is on the floor before the fire, her arms wrapped around as if she were hugging herself. On the floor beside her is a bloodstained bundle of sheets. ANNE looks up through the trailing locks of her hair..

D: I lost it. Almost without pain. And so fast it was over in a moment.
N: MARY looks down at the bundle of sheets..
C: MARY
D: Oh, Anne..
E: heart cracks
N: MARY hugs ANNE tightly. All animosity now gone..
C: ANNE
D: ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get rid of it somehow. No one must know.
N: EORGE rushes to a cupboard, and pulls out a cape. He wraps it around ANNE. Then he pours wine into a glass. MARY wraps ANNE in a blanket to warm her. And begins making the bed with fresh linen..
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: AN HOUR LATER: ANNE is composed. Staring into the fire. MARY and GEORGE sit on either side of her.
C: ANNE
D: It's not the first. Miscarriage.

C: ANNE
D: They will take it as proof that I cannot bear children. That I am cursed by God. And should be dispensed with.
C: MARY
D: Why? There's still time. You could sleep with the King, and fall pregnant again. No one would know..
C: ANNE
D: he King would never lie with me now, and risk damaging the `child' he believes I'm carrying.. a beat) Besides, he is barely capable anymore. And I couldn't go through that again.

D: What..? horrified) No..!
C: MARY
D: Stop it, Anne! It's madness..
C: ANNE
D: Don't you see? This affects all of us. If I go down, so do all of you. The only way to save ourselves..is to do this.. And pray it's a boy.
E: a beat
N: MARY covers her mouth in horror, gets to her feet..
C: MARY
D: I can't listen to this.. ...this is monstrous..
E: feeling nauseous
C: ANNE
D: Mary, sit down..
C: MARY
D: No, Anne! I understand you have had a shock tonight. A terrible shock. But there is no need for this..
N: MARY reaches the door, turns to GEORGE..

D: It's all right. You will be spared. The King as good as gave me his word.
C: ANNE
D: The King saw you?
C: MARY
D: Yes.
N: ANNE manages a rueful smile..
C: ANNE

C: MARY

C: ANNE
D: And now look?

C: MARY
D: e will spare you. I am sure of it.
N: ANNE takes a deep breath. Tries to look serene..
S: EXT. TOWER HILL - DAY
N: A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across Tower Hill to the scaffold. She shoots MARY an anxious look across the crowds.. MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and faces the CROWDS. Finally the jeers subside..
C: ANNE
D: I...I come here to die...a loyal subject..
N: More spit, jeers and abuse. MARY stands on tiptoe, cranes her neck. Anxiously scans the CROWDS for the GUARDS that will free ANNE..
C: MARY
D: Come on..
C: ANNE
D: ..I..I do not blame the King. Never was there a more just or goodly Lord..
N: Presently, MARY sees two SOLDIERS pushing through the CROWDS towards her. Her heart leaps..
C: ANNE
D: ..I beg God's forgiveness and his mercy..
N: ANNE looks up to see the SOLDIERS reaching MARY, and handing her a letter. ANNE smiles in relief. MARY opens the letter and reads..
C: CROMWELL
D: "Madam..."
E: V.O.
S: INT. CROMWELL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: THOMAS CROMWELL, the former assistant to WOLSEY, who has now replaced him, sits at his desk, writing the letter..
C: CROMWELL
D: ..the King has spared you because of his respect and affection for you and because you are the mother of his son."
E: V.O.
S: EXT. TOWER HILL - DAY
N: MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by
T: the EXECUTIONER..
C: CROMWELL
D: "But you risked your life coming to court and you are advised you not to do so again. You will not be shown the same clemency a second time. Your sister Anne was tried and found guilty, her crimes were high treason and she deserves to die. Cromwell."
E: V.O.
N: MARY, who is reading, looks up in horror..
C: MARY
D: No!
N: ANNE looks up. She sees the look on MARY's face. MARY's eyes. ANNE's eyes. `WHOOSH', the masked EXECUTIONER swings his sword. ANNE is beheaded. MARY almost chokes.. The CROWD falls eerily silent. A stunned calm descends on Tower Green. Nothing but the sound of the wind. MARY sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. She falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms.. ..WILLIAM STAFFORD, who has followed her to London. Suddenly the CROWDS burst into life. A great, bloodthirsty ROAR echoes around Tower Green as ANNE's head is lifted aloft.. WILLIAM STAFFORD carries MARY in his arms. They walk against the flow, of teaming CROWDS, and newly-arriving FAMILIES coming to watch the spectacle..
T: SLOW FADE TO BLACK:
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: SIR THOMAS BOLEYN sits by a window. Staring out at the fields beyond. Ashen-faced. Broken. CAPTION #1: "WRETCHED AND DISGRACED, SIR THOMAS BOLEYN DIED TWO YEARS LATER OF A BROKEN HEART."
S: EXT. FIELDS - DAY
N: We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of children's laughter. Excited shrieking. CAPTION #2: "AS SOLE HEIR, MARY INHERITED THE ENTIRE ESTATE." s in the opening scene: three CHILDREN, a BOY and two GIRLS, run through the fields, playing. Touchingly, they are barely taller than the corn, heads skimming along the sheaves.. CAPTION #3: "SHE AND WILLIAM STAFFORD LIVED HAPPILY AWAY FROM COURT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES." REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched from a distance by MARY and WILLIAM STAFFORD, standing outside Hever Castle. MARY smiles, shielding her eyes from the sun.. CAPTION #4: "MARY's SON, HENRY, WENT ON TO BECOME CLOSEST FRIEND AND ADVISER TO HIS COUSIN ELIZABETH.." We CLOSE on YOUNG HENRY and ANNE's unmistakable red-headed daughter ELIZABETH.. CAPTION: "WHO WENT ON TO BECOME QUEEN ELIZABETH I, ONE OF THE GREATEST MONARCHS IN BRITISH HISTORY." THE END
