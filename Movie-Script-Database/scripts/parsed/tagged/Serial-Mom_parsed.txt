DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by trade, divides the morning paper up between himself and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in high-school.

Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels of MOM'S car skid to a stop. The car door opens and MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme" builds.

MOM looks over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD advancing on her. Ducking behind a giant speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head. The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL LIPS" sickening theatrics. A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground. MOM's eyes light up in fury when she sees SCOTTY still alive, crawling out from under the lights, semi-conscious and bleeding. BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood.

SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS" plays the final deafening note of their song and the crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the act. DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD look to the stage in horror. DAD gasps in fear. MISTY and CHIP stare speechless as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over. BIRDIE comes to and then faints again. The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames light up again. MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears, mimicking that the music is much too loud. DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her. DAD puts his arms around CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE as they hang their heads in sorrow. "CAMEL LIPS" and the entire audience of grunge-punks boo and jeer the police as they drag MOM out as she smiles innocently in suburban lunacy.
