S: EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
N: Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.
C: TESS
D: And love slipped the bonds of restraint... At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties, funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring at Andy.
E: V.O.
C: TESS
D: His touch was like a cosmic `yes'. Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad, writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: EUSTACIA
D: `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck you to hell!' Scott stepped back from the cell door as the gob of spit flew.'
E: V.O.
S: 1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A
N: Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ; a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes, books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian - Thomas Hardy. He is writing.
C: GLEN
D: This complex contemporary matrix is what Hardy meant by `the ache of modernism.' He regards it.
E: V.O.
C: GLEN
D: Crap. He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Inchcombe had seen it all before. He'd seasoned it: the metallic smell of blood and gunshot; forensics hunched like vultures. The dreadful mundanity of murder, he thought.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED.
N: Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure.
C: NICHOLAS
D: He approached Patel, who was stricken. She was one for whom a corpse was still an obscenity. Inchcombe realised a disturbing truth. His lack of feeling was almost...
E: V.O. He stops writing. Sighs
C: NICHOLAS
D: Pathological...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PLAYGROUND.
N: A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from a magazine.
C: CASEY
D: `I've been wearing the wrong size all my life,' said Katie. `I was always popping out. Turns out I'm a 30GG,' she says. `Now my bras finally fit - though Simon prefers me without one.' Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs.
S: 4A INT. DAY. KITCHEN. 4A
N: A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty, she's now mumsy and countrified. She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection. Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.
C: BETH
D: Do you think I should be reminding them to drink enough? It's very hot out there...
C: MARY
D: Beth - they're writers, not babies. You run round after `em too much.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 3.
S: EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
N: Glen walks outside, breathing in the fresh air. Beth approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits.
C: BETH
D: Can I tempt you, Glen?
C: GLEN
D: Wow, thanks. Glen picks up a scone.
C: BETH
D: I often take something snacky down to Nicholas at this time of day. I know how the brain needs feeding. How are you settling in?
C: GLEN
D: Great. The last writer's retreat I stayed at kind of froze my balls off, you know?
C: BETH
D: Oh.
C: GLEN
D: Screeching firedoors, curried lasagne and a needy poet - from whom I still bear the scars.
C: BETH
D: We try to keep it peaceful here; far from the madding crowd.
C: GLEN
D: Well, it's paradise.
S: EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - VILLAGE STREET. TRIANGLE.
N: The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's shatteringly dull. Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom is epic. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 4. An open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the junction. The tones of Classic FM blare out, much to the enjoyment of the middle aged couple within.
C: CASEY
D: Frock horrors. This weeks top of the shocks goes to Katie Pound in an off the shoulder lime by Roberto.
C: JODY
D: She looks like a bug. Wankers!
E: Car hoots
C: CASEY
D: You wanna sack your stylist girl.
C: JODY
D: Bet they did that on purpose, dressed her up like an insect. Casey agrees. They zoom away.
S: EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS.
N: Glen lowers himself into a comfy garden chair, his mouth full of cream and jam. Behind him, Nicholas' shed.
C: GLEN
D: Perfect harmony.
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED.
N: Nicholas is panicking down the phone.
C: NICHOLAS
D: In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff are you doing there? I haven't told her yet.
S: 8A EXT. EWEDOWN. THE STREET NEAR THE BUS STOP. 8A
N: Nadia is walking up the road from the station in her high heels, carrying an overnight bag. She is weeping into her phone.
C: NADIA
D: Why not? You keep saying you want to be with me. Jody and Casey are all ears.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I can't tell her just like that. It's twenty five years; a marriage.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 4A.
C: NADIA
D: Come on Nicholas. Or I'm going to get in a taxi and find your farm. Come up there and -
N: NICHOLAS NO -
C: NADIA
D: Drag you out -
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 5. NICHOLAS NO, NO DON'T!
C: NADIA
D: I want to be with you. I thought you'd be pleased...
S: 8B POV. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD / INT. DAY. NICHOLAS' SHED 8B
N: Through the window Nicholas sees Beth leaving a scone by Diggory, a sleeping poet in a pretentious hat.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go to the pub and stay there. I'll come when I can.
C: NADIA
D: Are you going to tell her?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Just give me a couple of hours - He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking the phone back on to its holder.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Cock pie. Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: How's the worker?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Good actually. Just about to embark on forensics.
C: BETH
D: Well give me your pages and I'll get started. Nicholas hands her several pages.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Reckon I might pack it in a bit early today. Need to think about my blood smears. Might take a drive; have a pint. Stir the old grey matter up.
C: BETH
D: Who were you talking to just then?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Judy. She says the Impala contracts should be through in a day or two.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 5A. Beth immediately knows he is lying. The lie pains her. She goes to the door. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6. Beth decides to try and call his bluff.
C: BETH
D: I could come with you.
C: NICHOLAS
D: What?
C: BETH
D: For a drive. I don't know when we last went out. Buying time by biting his scone:
C: NICHOLAS
D: This is absolutely yummy.
C: BETH
D: We could go into Hadditon, get a meal.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Yes but. What about the guests?
C: BETH
D: Mary's got Casey to help.
C: NICHOLAS
D: But I'm supposed to be thinking, you know about the -
C: BETH
D: You can run it by me. I'm good at forensics. Nicholas has run out of excuses.
S: EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
N: Beth approaches Andy with her scones and biscuits. Nearby, Glen is sitting back in a sun-lounger. Diggory sleeps on.
C: BETH
D: Can I tempt you, Andy? Andy takes a scone with a wide smile.
C: BETH
D: That's Glen, our new academic. Turns out he's working on Thomas Hardy. Said he might have some farming questions.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Needs an expert yokel, does he?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6A.
C: BETH
D: Would you mind? And the writers are eating al fresco tonight; could you check there's no bird shit on the seats? Sorry. Beth looks distant, troubled.
C: ANDY
D: You OK?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7.
C: BETH
D: Yes. Nicholas and I are going out to dinner. As she walks away, Andy glances at the shed, a look of puzzled dislike on his face.
S: 9A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 9A
N: Glen settles back in his chair.
C: GLEN
D: It's paradise...
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED.
N: Nicholas, dreading his predicament, is staring out at a cow's arse. The cow starts to piss. He shuts his eyes in desperation. 10A I/E. DAY. TAMARA'S CAR. 10A Shooting from inside the car, we pass the sign "Ewedown".
S: EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET.
N: The same car drives through the village. Jody and Casey appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it. They both land on the windscreen.
C: JODY
D: Fucking bingo! Jody and Casey run away, laughing.
S: 11A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 11A
N: The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She looks around shocked, for the culprit. The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as well be a landfill site.
C: TAMARA
D: What a dump. As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7A.
S: EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM.
N: Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move. 12A DELETED 12A
S: EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM.
N: At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown, neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of recent abandonment. Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She backs away. She doesn't know what to do.
S: EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER.
N: Jody and Casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop. Three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the T-junction. One of them almost lands in the shop. An old lady comes out, shoo-ing them away.
C: JODY
D: We could walk up the garage.
C: CASEY
D: I'm supposed to be helping my mum up at Stonefield.
C: JODY
D: They keep you busy.
C: CASEY
D: Yeah.
C: JODY
D: You never stop, you! Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and Casey are not impressed.
N: DELETED. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 8.
S: EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO).
N: The writers are sitting round a table lit with tea-lights in jars. Casey is helping her mum, Mary, an efficient local woman in her late thirties. She wobbles the heavy serving dishes dangerously.
C: GLEN
D: It was called `From Hearth to Heath - Doomsday and Revelation in Victorian verse.'
C: TESS
D: What was it about?
C: GLEN
D: Oh you know. Pale poets on laudanum, dark towers and sunless seas - a little sturm and drang in a teacup.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 9. At an upstairs window we can see Beth hold a dress up to herself and then abandon the idea.
C: TESS
D: Did it sell?
C: GLEN
D: Well my kind of books aren't about sales. I mean that's not why I write. So... no.
C: TESS
D: What are you working on next? Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a blouse.
S: INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. BETH'S BEDROOM.
N: Beth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror. She's full of hope that Nicholas will take her out - and dread that he'll find some excuse.
S: EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS (PATIO).
C: GLEN
D: Thomas Hardy.
C: DIGGORY
D: Is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore?
C: GLEN
D: Excuse me but there is nothing dull about Hardy. That is a misconception.
C: TESS
D: At least you've been published. I'm seething with envy; I'd love to be published.
C: EUSTACIA
D: I publish myself on the internet.
C: TESS
D: Oh, do you earn money doing that?
C: EUSTACIA
D: No.
C: GLEN
D: So what do you write?
C: EUSTACIA
D: Lesbian crime.

S: INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS.
N: The door to the garden is open, letting in the eveing air. Nicholas is waiting for Beth by the mirror. He is full of unease - but can't help finding himself handsome. His phone bleeps; a text. He reads it anxiously. NICHOLAS (CALLING) Beth, why don't I just pop out on my own? Beth, determined to force things, comes downstairs.
C: BETH
D: But I'm ready. Come on. She's on her way to join him.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Is that - I mean - are you wearing that?
C: BETH
D: Oh.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Just looks a bit... hot. Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off, gutted.
C: NICHOLAS
D: You know, Haddition's always packed with pissed Londonites on a Friday. I doubt we'll get a table anyway. Let's do it properly next week; make an occasion. I'm always taking you for granted. I'm vile I know; you should kick me really, but - He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: Who is she? The question hangs in the air. Nicholas' smile is frozen.
C: NICHOLAS
D: What? For a moment, he tries to find a lie.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Oh come on, Beth.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: Tell me. Who?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 11.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Look, it's nothing. It's been once or twice, that's all. Beth, it's not anything. Beth is raw with pain.

N: Nicholas coughs up.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Just a researcher with Radio 4.
C: BETH

D: Nadia, Nadia Patel. This hits a nerve.
C: BETH
D: Patel? She's in your book.
C: NICHOLAS
D: No, no I met her when I was on Desert Island Discs.
C: BETH
D: You put her in your book!
C: NICHOLAS
D: Just the name.
C: BETH
D: And Desert Island Discs was a year ago.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Yes but -

D: Joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam, in freedom - His phone beeps.
C: BETH
D: That's from her isn't it? Are you keeping her waiting? Nicholas finally snaps.
C: NICHOLAS
D: We've talked a lot about the creative mind and we agreed that it needs freedom to explore!
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12A.
C: BETH
D: Take your freedom. I can't live like this any more. It makes me feel WORTHLESS!
E: leaving the house
S: EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO/PORCH).
N: Casey gawps, fascinated. Nicholas is following Beth outside. Her agony travels through the quiet evening air. The writers are open-mouthed.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Calm yourself down!
C: BETH
D: Go set up home with Patel. See if she does your tax return.
E: O.S.

D: Will you please -

D: Do you love her?? Diggory's fork stays in mid-air. Glen is horribly fascinated.

C: BETH
D: Is she young?
C: NICHOLAS
D: For heaven's sake.
N: BETH IS SHE? NICHOLAS
C: YES!

C: BETH
D: If you leave here tonight to be with her... Don't come back.
E: O.S.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Beth... For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise.
C: NICHOLAS
D: You're making fools of us both. Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit.
C: BETH
D: Liar. Glen cringes. Beth slams the door. Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the writers to get to his car.

S: INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. TAMARA'S BATHROOM
N: Tamara is in a deep bubble bath. She glances at herself in the mirror, scrutinising her beauty. She fingers her nose. Slowly a look of doubt steals over her - as if she's not quite comfortable in her own skin.
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN.
N: Glen is eating his breakfast looking at all the Hardiment's family memorabilia in the kitchen. Andy is eating toast.
C: GLEN
D: So the Hardiments have lived here centuries, huh?
C: ANDY
D: No, `bout twenty years. Still strangers by local standards. Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard.
C: BETH
D: Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I think she's coming into heat. She goes out.

N: Glen wanders into Beth's office. The wall in front of him is dominated by a framed newspaper profile of Nicholas, surrounded by framed covers of Inchcombe books. The whole room is a shrine to Nicholas' career. Glen is in the hall looking at Beth's prints and pictures; old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers who have stayed at the retreat. He stares at a print of farm workers in the nineteenth century. Glen sighs.

D: But if that's your decision, I'll have to learn to live with it. Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end the call. For Beth's benefit:
E: O.S.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I told you. I love my wife. Don't ever phone me again. Glen is shocked by this duplicity.
E: Into his phone
C: NICHOLAS
D: Beth...
C: BETH
D: No don't touch me, don't you dare. Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them - too late.
E: CONT'D
C: NICHOLAS
D: I'm sorry.
C: BETH
D: Not good enough. Not any more.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I'm sorry.
C: BETH
D: You do what you like and then you're sorry?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 18A.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I hate myself. I hate myself. Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him. Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty.
E: O.S.
C: BETH
D: Where were you?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Drove her back to London. Took all night.
C: BETH
D: You drove her home?
C: NICHOLAS
D: She was in a state.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 19.
C: BETH
D: Do you think she'll get over it?... Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I'm sorry. Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms, holding each other.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I don't know why I'm like this. I couldn't do without you. Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again. Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating. He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: I've got to go to the bottle bank.
C: NICHOLAS
D: OK... Let's talk later.
C: BETH
D: Yes. The goat's come into heat.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Has it?
C: BETH
D: I love you so much.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Me too. Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange. He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas' lies.

C: GLEN
D: I've just seen the Hardiments kiss and make up.
N: DIGGORY (IRRITATED) The hat is on.
C: GLEN
D: Looks like she's taking him back.
C: DIGGORY
D: When the hat is on, it means don't speak.
N: GLEN (WITH IRONY) So... Peace is restored. The sound of a burglar alarm suddenly blares over the garden. Diggory sits up, infuriated.
S: EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LIMBURY).
N: Glen is following Andy down the hill from Stonefield. The cows are too close for Glen's comfort. He hurries through.
C: GLEN
D: I don't like cows. I mean really. They exude bovine malice.
C: ANDY
D: Yeah, these girls are killing machines. They don't like Americans either.

D: It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died a while back. Place is empty.
C: GLEN
D: You think it's being robbed?
C: ANDY
D: Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do round here except make trouble.

N: Glen and Andy are going up the hill towards Winnards.
C: ANDY
D: Used to belong to my dad, this place.
C: GLEN
D: Really?
C: ANDY
D: But it all went tits-up. Land was flogged to a consortium and the house was sold to Londoners; the Drewes.
C: GLEN
D: So this is your ancestral pile?
C: ANDY
D: Was. Born in that room up there. He points up at the back bedroom window.
C: GLEN
D: You must have been pretty resentful.
S: 1995. EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE LANE.
N: An eighteen year old Andy jumps off a stile into the lane behind a slim, fifteen year old girl on a horse.
C: ANDY
D: Hey.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21A. The girl turns. She has a huge nose.
C: ANDY
D: This farm's mine, big nose.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 22. The girl kicks the horse into a trot, her nose in the air.
S: EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM.
N: Andy and Glen turn the corner to the back of the house. Tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box.
C: ANDY
D: Hey, what're you doing? Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack.
C: ANDY
D: Who are you??
E: CONT'D
C: TAMARA
D: Andy, you moron; it's me. Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition.
C: ANDY
D: Tam?... Hardly recognise you. Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal.

D: You won't do it that way.
E: CONT'D
C: TAMARA
D: Then help me!
S: INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN.
N: Andy turns the alarm off. Tamara enters the dusty kitchen.
C: ANDY
D: Used to do bits of work for your mum. Been keeping an eye on the place since she died.
C: TAMARA
D: What sort of work, graphics?
C: ANDY
D: I do horticulture now.
C: TAMARA
D: You're a gardener? Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 23.
C: GLEN
D: This is a great old house.
C: TAMARA
D: Would you like to buy it?
C: GLEN
D: I'm not really the property-owning kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand luggage.
C: ANDY
D: That's why you're back, to flog it?
C: TAMARA
D: Yes.
C: ANDY
D: Make a nice second home for some banker wankers.
C: TAMARA
D: Andy if you want it, why don't you make me an offer?
C: ANDY
D: Because sadly I'm still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land.
C: TAMARA
D: Unlucky. Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles.

S: 1996. INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - A SHED.
N: Tamara pulling down her pants; Andy unbuttoning his jeans. She jumps up on the worktable, pushing a stack of turnips out of the way. They kiss passionately.
C: ANDY
D: You should find someone you're in love with.
C: TAMARA
D: You stupid prick. Andy looks at her. She is sincere.
C: ANDY
D: You saying you love me, frosty tits?
C: TAMARA
D: You first.

S: INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN.
N: Tamara is watching Andy walk away with Glen. Her eyes follow him curiously - then she firmly turns her back. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24A. Tamara rips a bin liner off the roll and shakes it out. She takes a deep breath. She opens the cupboard and begins to bin the distressing mountain of empty wine bottles.
S: EXT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
N: Beth is standing at the hedge looking down at the valley with Nicholas at her side.
C: BETH
D: Thinking of the first time we saw this place...
C: NICHOLAS
D: You've made it a wonderful home Beth.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 25.
C: BETH
D: Not wonderful enough. She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back.
C: NICHOLAS
D: If you can't put this behind you, then we're stuck.
C: BETH
D: Well I'd better sort myself out then.
C: NICHOLAS
D: What has to happen? I am sorry - Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it; draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the depth of Beth's physical love for him. At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration.
C: GLEN
D: Just taking the air. Flustered, he knocks into a tub of lobelias. Beth and Nicholas remain. The moment between them is gone. Round the corner, Glen is cringing.

C: JODY
D: So? They turn to a big spread on a band called Swipe.
C: CASEY
D: Swipe.

D: Ben Sergeant... I'd walk through fire to do him.
C: CASEY
D: The drummer?
C: JODY
D: He's not just the drummer. He writes the lyrics; it's his band. He's the fucking genius, not Steve Culley or any of these wankers. It's Ben.
C: CASEY
D: OK. I'd do Ben.
C: JODY
D: I wanna be her, in that dress with him licking my teapot lids.
C: CASEY
D: Yeah... me too.
S: EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
N: Casey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of nibbles on the patio. She stands among the writers, watching a fly get caught in one of the vol-au-vents.
C: DIGGORY
D: People talk about the muscularity in prose. I want a similar muscularity in my verse. I don't want a poetry that's flabby or obese - that's why I adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes: Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen.
C: DIGGORY
D: ABB ACC DEE D. They give you the armature, the beating heart, the nerve ends...
C: NICHOLAS
D: So has the muse shone on you, Greg?
C: GLEN
D: I've been pretty distracted. Most recently by those delicious cookie things that Beth brought round this afternoon.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Oh yes. Of course we call them biscuits here.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 26A.
C: GLEN
D: And by the place itself, the people.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Sometimes wish I could get distracted. Ten page a day man, rain or shine.

D: Wow, that's scary. Ten pages; how do you do that?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Well, Greg -
N: GLEN GLEN -
C: NICHOLAS
D: I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips.
C: GLEN
D: Matter of fact I read one of your books. Another distraction but I thought it was decent stuff.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Well. He's offended.
C: NICHOLAS
D: How do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg. Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his breath, Glen impersonates:
E: CONT'D
C: GLEN
D: `We call them biscuits, here.' Nicholas raises his glass for a toast.
C: NICHOLAS
D: To the muse, however you find her. He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts, his glass still in the air.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Who's that? Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen.
E: CONT'D
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28.
C: GLEN
D: That's Tamara Drewe.
C: NICHOLAS
D: No it isn't.
C: GLEN
D: I met her with Andy.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Good God. What's happened to her?
C: POPPY
D: She's had a nose job, Dad.
C: NICHOLAS
D: She's completely different.
C: GLEN
D: That's what Andy said.
C: BETH
D: Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She used to come and help you wash the car, didn't she Nicholas? I think she liked a bit of family after her dad left.
C: TESS
D: Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the column in one of the Sundays?
C: BETH
D: Used to. Writes for the Independent now.
C: TESS
D: She spent weeks going on about her nose job. Smart way to pay for it I suppose. Was her old one an awful conk?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Yes.
C: BETH
D: She's poured herself into those shorts. I hope they don't give her thrush.
C: TESS
D: What's the etiquette with nose jobs? Do we mention it, or... Tamara has arrived in earshot. Absolutely everyone, including a very curious Casey, is staring at her nose.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28A.
C: TAMARA
D: Hello. Sorry to intrude. Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards her, full of warmth.
C: POPPY
D: Hey, Tamara.
C: TAMARA
D: Poppy, how are you?
C: POPPY
D: Love your new hooter.
C: TAMARA
D: Thanks. It isn't actually new; just smaller...
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 29. At last Beth remembers her manners.
C: BETH
D: Tamara, so sorry about your mum.
C: TAMARA
D: Thank you...
C: BETH
D: Are you staying down for a while?
C: TAMARA
D: I'll have to. There's so much to be done.
C: BETH
D: You must let us know if we can help.
C: TAMARA
D: Actually, I was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms. I've got a skip coming tomorrow and -
C: BETH
D: Nicholas? - Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word.
C: GLEN
D: I'm available. I do skips.
C: DIGGORY
D: I... No.
C: TAMARA
D: Well thank you. You're very kind... Is Andy around at all? Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.
C: BETH
D: Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons.
S: EXT. NEXT DAY. WINNARDS FARM.
N: Tamara and Glen are carrying junk out to a skip. Tamara is in big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30.
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN.
N: Beth is preparing lunch, talking to Poppy. Nicholas is going through his typed-up manuscript; not really listening.
C: BETH
D: She's had the writers down there helping her all day. I hope she realises they're here to work...
C: POPPY
D: Can't believe what a difference her nose makes.
C: BETH
D: Well I think it's a mistake; taken away all her character.
C: POPPY
D: Come on; she looks ten times better.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Huh.
C: BETH
D: And she knows it. I found those shorts really irritating. Going around with half her bum hanging out. I mean, why?
C: POPPY
D: To annoy people like you. Might get a pair myself.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Of course you won't.
C: POPPY
D: Why not?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Because you're not desperate, are you? Always something a bit desperate about Tamara Drewe. Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on.
S: EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM.
N: Tamara and Glen are having a rest.
C: GLEN
D: So why did you change your face?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30A.
C: TAMARA
D: Changing my face is the best thing I ever did. And I don't care what anyone thinks.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31.
C: GLEN
D: Would it work for me?
C: TAMARA
D: Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.
C: GLEN
D: Oh, you're just coming on to me... Tamara laughs. She starts work again.
C: GLEN
D: In your column, you write about yourself... Does that come easily?
C: TAMARA
D: No... But it feels right. My first novel's definitely going to be autobiographical.
C: GLEN
D: Your first novel? You're going to dash one off just like that?
C: TAMARA
D: Ideally, I'd like to make it into fiction before I'm thirty.
C: GLEN
D: And then maybe a swimwear collection, a chat show, a pasta sauce range?
C: TAMARA
D: What?
C: GLEN
D: Life sure is easy for the beautiful.
C: TAMARA
D: You know before I got the nose job I had no trouble getting taken seriously. Maybe, when they removed that bit of cartilage, they pulled my brain out by mistake - what do you think? Glen smiles, won over.
S: INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB.
N: Glen is coming from the bar with a pint for Andy and a half for himself. He has just been served by Zoe.

D: She's single, man. Andy looks over at Zoe.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31A.
C: ANDY
D: Well it's not exactly a relationship; we just have an occasional thing. Zoe doesn't want to be tied down and -
C: GLEN
D: Not Zoe! Tamara... You should get in there. Marry the girl. Then you get to live back in your ancestral home.
C: ANDY
D: No way. Not her type.
C: GLEN
D: The trouble is Andy, you think like a loser. And I know that because I'm the loser that losers turn to for tips. I'm the losers loser.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 32.
C: ANDY
D: I'm a pedigree loser. I had a graphics business; went bust. And then with my great business acumen I invested in a polytunnel full of ganja.
C: GLEN
D: Wow. How'd that go?
C: ANDY
D: Made a tit of myself. Spent about six years stoned out of my box and I'm only just getting it back together. Besides, even if I was the last man in the world, Tamara Drewe wouldn't have me.
C: GLEN
D: Why not?
C: ANDY
D: I dumped her.
C: GLEN
D: Oh, you are a loser.
C: ANDY
D: I was twenty. My mates thought I was cradle snatching... And they used to call her Beaky.
S: 1996. EXT. DAY. OUTSIDE THE PUB.
N: Tamara in her school uniform, is gutted.

D: Beaky?... We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.
S: INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB.
N: Glen is preparing to leave.

N: ANDY (SMILING) Piss off, Glen. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33.

D: Have you?
C: TAMARA
D: The bit where Doctor Inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy's daughter. Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth closer to his.

C: NICHOLAS
D: Think it's time you went. Tamara is mortified.
C: NICHOLAS
D: You're making yourself ridiculous. This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and throws it over the car - and Nicholas.

C: GLEN
D: A man can dream, huh? Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what he's talking about.
S: INT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM.
N: Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom. She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up. She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks lost.
S: EXT. DAY. ANOTHER FARM - THE GOAT PEN.
N: Tamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to Andy. He is watching Ingrid meet Darcy, a billy goat.
C: ANDY
D: Go on Ingrid; have some kids.
C: TAMARA
D: Pretty direct isn't he? He's not even bought her a coke. Andy turns. Sees her.
C: TAMARA
D: And he stinks.

C: ANDY
D: We should go for a drink sometime, Tam. You know, for old times sake.
C: TAMARA
D: So we can reminisce about how I smashed your nose?
C: ANDY
D: You didn't smash it.
C: TAMARA
D: Yes I did.
C: ANDY
D: It just bled. The memory is between them.
C: TAMARA
D: I've got to do the house up before I sell it. It looks like an eighties timewarp. Would you like the job? He just looks at her.
C: TAMARA
D: Painting it and tidying the garden? Good hourly rate.

D: It can't be easy down there, Tam.
C: TAMARA
D: What d'you mean?

D: You'd do that?

D: I'll get it tomorrow. I'm on my way down to Winnards. Doing one or two jobs for Tamara.
C: BETH
D: She's got you helping her too?
C: ANDY
D: Just painting, decorating, sorting the garden. Beth is quite put out.
C: BETH
D: Andy, that sounds like a lot. I need you here.
C: ANDY
D: I can easily do both.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 37A.
C: BETH
D: As long as you're not working for her in the hours that I pay you. Without thinking, she has made Andy feel like a servant.
C: ANDY
D: Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 38. He walks on, leaving Beth feeling very uncomfortable - and somehow slightly bereft.
S: INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GROUNDS / KITCHEN.
N: Andy comes in. He shouts into the house.
C: ANDY
D: Tam? Got some colour charts for you to see. He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill.
C: TAMARA
D: What would you choose for in here?
C: ANDY
D: Well... I'd have this one. And then upstairs in the bedroom -
N: TAMARA
C: OK.
D: She starts gathering her things.
C: ANDY
D: So what d'you have to do to get a cup of tea round here?
C: TAMARA
D: Make it.
N: (SHE POINTS) Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge. (SHE GRINS) I'm off to work. Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away.
S: EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE PERIMETER FENCE.
N: Pounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A security guard is already running towards them.
C: JODY
D: This is our village. Our fucking field.
N: GUARD OUT! GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 39. JODY COME ON YOU BASTARD LET US IN! Jody is ready for a fight but Casey pulls her back.
T: CUT.
S: EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS
N: Beth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched, breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She smiles. At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires.
S: EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE MAIN STAGE.
N: Swipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime. There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford. The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer, Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic. He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is getting more and more furious. In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods. Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate the boys. Ben takes a microphone.
C: BEN
D: Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no more. Steve Culley is a cunt. Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Ben! Ben! What's happening?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40.
C: BEN
D: He's seeing Fran. I won't work with that tosser again.
C: FRAN
D: Steve! Don't! Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben.
C: STEVE
D: You fucking baby. Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name. Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.
C: TAMARA
D: Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: TAMARA
D: I'm supposed to be interviewing you - for the Independent. She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair.
C: TAMARA
D: It was scheduled for later but maybe now's a better time...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER.
N: Jody, Casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider.
C: JODY
D: They should let us in free.
C: RYAN
D: Too right. They come here, drink our water, use our fields, they leave all their crap in our drains - Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him.
C: JODY
D: Ben! Ben! She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving.
C: CASEY
D: What are you doing?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40A.
C: JODY
D: That was Ben from Swipe! Ben!!
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 41. Jody and Casey scream with delight, chasing the car.
S: EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM.
N: Ben skids his Porsche to a halt right next to Tamara's car. He jumps out. Boss follows. Tamara is walking towards the door. The distant festival is still audible. Tamara backs towards the door, with Ben inches away.
C: BEN
D: That's Boss.
C: TAMARA
D: Hi Boss.
C: BEN
D: You're not allergic are you?
C: TAMARA
D: To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are your influences, Ben?
C: BEN
D: Everyone asks that. This your place?
C: TAMARA
D: I'm selling. D'you want it?
C: BEN
D: No, I want something else. Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill, breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door.
C: JODY
D: Who the fuck's she?
C: CASEY
D: I seen her up at Stonefield. She's got a nose made of plastic.
C: JODY
D: How come she gets Ben? I've loved him since March. Just as Ben's about to kiss her, Tamara coolly opens the door and draws him into the house.
C: CASEY
D: Wow... Jody is gutted; feeling the full injustice of her life.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 42.
S: INT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM - KITCHEN
N: Tamara leads Ben to the kitchen. The hall has been stripped.
C: TAMARA
D: Would you like a beer?
C: BEN
D: Yep. Maureen Tucker.
C: TAMARA
D: Who? Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't kissed her and he's just about to.
C: BEN
D: Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five foot nothing. Used to stand up to play. Put the snare drum on its side and hit it with mallets. Mentalist.
C: TAMARA
D: You write all the songs; that's pretty rare for a drummer.
C: BEN
D: Everything you've ever heard about drummers is total shit.
C: TAMARA
D: You mean you don't spontaneously combust?
C: BEN
D: Only sometimes. She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her.
C: BEN
D: Any more questions? Tamara is speechless. He kisses her.
E: CONT'D
S: 65 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD AND THE COPSE - NEXT MORNING (LARKHAM).
N: Andy is walking in the copse up to Tamara's. He spots a couple of wild mushrooms and picks them. In the distance he sees Glen bending and stretching. A cow is looking at him over the fence. Glen sees it and startles. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 43. The sight makes Andy smile. He carries on towards Winnards Farm in high spirits.
S: EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM.
N: Andy comes up to the house. He sees the yellow Porsche; then a large boxer dog sitting by the front garden. It starts barking at him. Andy calms him right down.
C: ANDY
D: Hey, hey - who are you, mate - lost, are you? Andy strokes Boss.
S: 66A EXT. DAY. BACK OF WINNARDS. 66A

N: Andy opens the kitchen door.
C: ANDY
D: Tam? You want breakfast? Boss bounds inside and disappears.
N: ANDY WOAH - Andy is puzzled. He steps into the hall.
C: ANDY
D: Do you know about this dog, Tam - He notices two half-drunk beers. He wanders into the hall. He sees Ben's boots and most of Tamara's clothes, abandoned. The unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from Tamara's room. He turns on his heels, pained.
S: EXT. DAY. THE FIELD. (WINNARDS).
N: Andy strides back across the field, chucking the mushrooms in the mud on his way. AUTUMN. 68aa POSY DRAWING 68aa GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 43A.
S: 68A EXT. DAY. WINNARD'S FARM. 68A
N: Postcard of Winnards Farm. The exterior is half-decorated. Two cars parked - Tamara's and the yellow Porsche, which looks more like a permanent fixture. The garden has been cleared and dug, ready to plant. Andy is stoking a bonfire. He is smouldering like the embers. He gives the yellow Porsche an angry look.
S: 68AA EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE FIELD. 68AA
N: Nicholas and Glen are both walking in the field. They pass each other, each managing a painful smile.
C: NICHOLAS
D: How goes the opus?
C: GLEN
D: Fine Nicholas, just fine... Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen into deep anxiety.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 44.
S: EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD.
N: Beth is mending the engine of her huge mower. Glen, now wearing a scarf, is sitting on the seat watching her work.
C: GLEN
D: It's his most obscure novel `The Well- Beloved'. Most people have never even heard of it. About this guy of twenty who falls in love with a beautiful young woman. Then when he's forty, he meets the woman's daughter and he falls in love with her. And finally, when he's sixty he meets the
N: GRANDDAUGHTER -
C: BETH
D: Oh he doesn't.
C: GLEN
D: Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy was like that in his life, too. Even as he aged, he only had eyes for young women. Like, in one essential way he never grew up.
C: BETH
D: In his trousers.
C: GLEN
D: He was still at it in his eighties. You know? Snow on the rooftop but fire in the cellar...
C: BETH
D: Why won't it come for you Glen? The way you talk about it's so engaging.
C: GLEN
D: Yeah but there's an academic style, you know?
C: BETH
D: Who are you writing for? Who's your ideal reader?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 45. Glen can't answer.
C: BETH
D: Because if you wrote the way you spoke... it would make me want to read Hardy.
C: GLEN
D: Really?
C: BETH
D: Yes. If you wrote like you were talking to a friend... Pass me that thing. Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt.
C: BETH
D: Try it now. Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused.
T: 69A CUT 69A
S: INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE DINING ROOM.
N: A cosy dinner for all the writers - more ladies in their forties and fifties. Nicholas is topping up his glass.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I simply pander to popular taste.
C: CAITLIN
D: Oh your books are far more than that.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Just airport fodder... Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich.
C: CAITLIN
D: Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe - for all his flaws - is a man with total integrity.
C: GLEN
D: Who did you base him on, Nicholas?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 46. NICHOLAS (IGNORING GLEN) My books don't say anything profound. I can't pretend to be an intellectual - not like Glen here, illuminating our ignorance with his critical glow - but I do love prose. And I think I can turn a reasonable story. Glen peers into the kitchen. Beth is serving desserts.
C: GLEN
D: Excuse me. He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like cups around a teapot.
C: GLEN
D: Let me help.
C: BETH
D: They need dusting with this.
C: GLEN
D: I went to my room and I wrote for three hours. The time just vanished.
C: BETH
D: That's great, that's brilliant.
C: GLEN
D: I feel like a man who's just passed a gargantuan stool.
C: BETH
D: Super. Sprig of mint on the top. Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens to Nicholas as he serves them.
C: NICHOLAS
D: The real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie. A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Because that's what storytellers are. Thieves and liars...
E: CONT'D
C: GLEN
D: `The basis of all excellence is truth.' Samuel Johnson. Glen's intellect wins the day. Nicholas smarts.

N: The room - her mother's - is empty except for a mattress on the floor, clothes rail, designer bean bag and desk. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 47. Tamara is sitting at it, tapping away on her PC, almost pained with concentration. Ben is bored.
C: BEN
D: Are you done yet?
C: TAMARA
D: I'm just starting something.
C: BEN
D: That poxy column? Can't it wait?
C: TAMARA
D: Not the column. Just stuff coming out. Don't want to stop it.
C: BEN
D: Do it later. Play with me. Ben strums his guitar, determined to get her attention.
C: BEN
D: She is such fun she's sexy And she lives on an old farm But something gnaws away at me It's causing me real harm. Tamara, what can you do with it? What can you do with her name? Its stands there lonely and rhymeless It's driving me nearly insane.

C: BEN
D: Hey - Andy? Andy looks up. Ben is at the bedroom window, naked.
E: O.S.
C: BEN
D: Can you let my dog in? Thanks mate. Jody and Casey watch from behind the hedge as Andy angrily goes to let the dog in.
E: CONT'D
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 48.
C: CASEY
D: He must like kissing plastic.
C: JODY
D: He doesn't love her. He's just on the rebound from losing Fran; numbing his pain with loads of empty, rampant sex. What he really needs...
C: CASEY
D: Is a fifteen year old from Ewedown.
C: JODY
D: So? Stranger things happen. He's only ten years older and that's nothing. If he met me, if he just met me...
C: CASEY
D: It'd be love, right?
C: JODY
D: Yeah.
N: (SHE GRINS) But I'd settle for sex.
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE BARN
N: Beth is feeding the hens.
C: BETH
D: Coo-er... In your parents' bedroom? Still I suppose being an exhibitionist is part of his job - strutting about on stage.
C: ANDY
D: He doesn't strut; he's a drummer. He sits on his arse.
C: BETH
D: Very good-looking, isn't he? Poppy You-Tubed him and we both got quite hot and bothered. Is that his car - the yellow Porsche?
C: ANDY
D: Yep.
C: BETH
D: Bit brash, vrooming through the village... But fancy our Tamara bagging a bone fide rock star. She was such an ugly duckling. She must be thrilled to bits.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 48A. Andy can't listen to any more.
S: INT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PUB.
N: Andy peers through the door. Zoe is setting tables. He knocks. Zoe let's him in.

C: ZOE
D: Don't know if I can stick a winter here. The way the light disappears; it's doing me in. I'm a blue sky girl. Got to have some warmth. Andy just looks up at her, smiling his understanding.
C: ANDY
D: We all need a bit of that, don't we.
S: 76AA EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 76AA
N: Boss is outside, sniffing round the front door. Sounds of the end of an epic shag from the upstairs window. He sits, bored. He hears the noise of crows in the field. He is off like a shot.
S: 76A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE FIELD IN FRONT OF NICHOLAS' SHED.
C: 76A
D: Boss is having the time of his life chasing the cows. Penny Upminister, an uppercrust landowner in a horrible coat is trying to catch him.
N: 78 I/E. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED / THE FIELD (LIMBURY) The whole herd is now on the rampage, Boss in pursuit, Penny bringing up the rear. Nicholas sees them heading straight for his shed.

S: INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM.
N: Tamara is opening a Tiffany's box. There is a ring inside it. She looks at Ben, almost in disbelief. Boss can be heard, barks fading in the distance.
C: TAMARA
D: What's this?
C: BEN
D: What's it look like?
C: TAMARA
D: Ben... For which finger?
C: BEN
D: Whatever one you like. That's a nice one. Why not put it on that? He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 49A.

N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50.
C: BETH
D: Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out. Nicholas is approaching.

D: It beats me why you people want to live in the country. You've got no sense of responsibility.
C: BETH
D: It's not our dog!
C: NICHOLAS
D: Hello, Penny. How's tricks? Penny is suddenly all coy.
C: PENNY
D: Oh - Nicholas...

C: PENNY
D: What, this old thing?
C: NICHOLAS
D: You look like royalty.
C: PENNY
D: Well, I try... Can't wait for your next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce- pot. Giles is always says `What are you reading Penny? You've got steam coming out of your ears...' She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding away with the dog, infuriated.
E: laughs, delighted
S: INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM
N: Ben has put a ring on Tamara's finger.
C: TAMARA
D: So what's the ring saying, Ben?

E: CONT'D
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50A.

N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 51.
C: TAMARA
D: That you were in love with me.
C: BEN
D: The ring says I'm platinum with a long guarantee. So give me a reply. Tamara is grinning from ear to ear.
C: TAMARA
D: You're the best fun in the world. I'd love to marry you. She throws her arms around his neck.
C: TAMARA
D: Can I say it then?
E: CONT'D
C: BEN
D: Say what?
C: TAMARA
D: I love you. Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings.
N: BEN (ANSWERING IT) What? She's being proposed to.
S: EXT. DAY. TEN MINUTES LATER. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
N: Ben's Porsche skids to a halt, music blaring. Diggory is looking on in irate astonishment. The hat is on.
C: BETH
D: Shhh! There are writers here, trying to write. Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms.
C: BETH
D: This is a Buff Orpington. She's looking a bit peaky today. Not a great layer but she's very decorative. Beth puts down the hen.
C: BETH
D: We're fully organic - but I like to think that our champion product is the written word. Nicholas approaches, his hand held out, heartily.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 52.
C: NICHOLAS
D: The famous Ben - Swipe, eh? Ben just about manages to shake it.
C: BEN
D: Swipe's over. Thought the whole world knew that.
C: NICHOLAS
D: It wasn't on Newsnight, no.
C: BETH
D: Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't that lovely? He'd just popped the question when I rang.
C: NICHOLAS
D: She said yes? Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted.
C: BETH
D: We're delighted for you both. Boss leaps up, straining against a chain.
C: BEN
D: Why's he on a chain?
C: BETH
D: He was out of control.
C: BEN
D: How'd you like to be chained up?
C: BETH
D: He was chasing livestock. He could've got shot.
C: BEN
D: They shoot him; I'll fucking shoot them. He takes Boss. Beth and Nicholas are left alone.
C: NICHOLAS
D: I think the word is gobshite.
C: BETH
D: I hope he makes her happy. It's hard for girls when their dads walk out. Gives them bad taste in men.
C: NICHOLAS
D: What's that supposed to mean?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 53.
C: BETH
D: Just saying her father left when she was a girl and -
C: NICHOLAS
D: That is ten pence psychology! You don't know what you're talking about, do you? He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback.
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED/ EXT. WINNARDS
N: Nicholas, wearing a woolly hat and scarf, is writing.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Patel's eyes were open, eloquent in death... He looks up. In the distance, he can just see Tamara talking to Andy in the garden at Winnards Farm. Nicholas opens his desk. He finds a pair of old binoculars. He focuses them on Tamara. She holds out her hand with the ring on it. Andy has his arms wrapped around himself, his shoulders hunched. He nods, affecting congratulations. Nicholas tries to close in on Tamara. But she turns and goes indoors. Also the yellow Porsche arrives. Nicholas puts the binoculars down.
E: V.O.

C: BEN
D: `Mai Buff Orpingtons. Oh, the written word. That's what the country does to you; turns you into one. What's up?
C: TAMARA
D: It's a shame it doesn't fit. Perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it.
C: BEN
D: Yeah but I didn't know you then.
C: TAMARA
D: So... when did you buy it?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 54. Ben realises his mistake. Tamara laughs, shocked.
C: TAMARA
D: Was this for someone else? Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns.
E: CONT'D
C: TAMARA
D: You gave it to Fran didn't you?
E: CONT'D
C: BEN
D: So? It's yours now. She never wore it. She didn't want it.
C: TAMARA
D: You asked her to marry you...?
C: BEN
D: It was a gesture, OK, when she started seeing Steve. Backfired, anyway. Look, I love you now. Tamara doesn't believe him. She is devastated.
C: BEN
D: It's not the ring that matters. I mean fuck the ring. It's just a consumerist piece of zinc. What matters is I want to marry you.
E: CONT'D
C: TAMARA
D: Do you?
C: BEN
D: Yeah. With my whole heart. And all the other stuff. Like my brain and my entrails and my whatever, pancreas. It all wants to marry you. He hugs her, starts kissing her but Tamara hardly responds.

C: BETH
D: She wondered if you had a delivery date in mind. I told her Easterish. Mind that cocoa, it's hot. Across at Winnards, Tamara's bedroom light comes on. For a moment, she gazes out. Nicholas gazes back.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 55.
C: BETH

N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 57.

D: Is that Claire with an `i'? Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side.
C: BETH
D: What about you, Glen? Where will you be?
C: GLEN

D: You know, this is the best mince pie I've ever had.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: Oh?
C: GLEN
D: If it was possible to have an orgasm from mere food, this mince pie would do it.
N: BETH (EMBARRASSED) Golly. She moves away. Glen heads for the wine, kicking himself. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 58. Tamara and Ben walk in. Ben looks at the country casuals in undisguised horror.
C: BEN
D: What the fuck are we doing here?
C: TAMARA
D: It's kind of research; I want to write about them. They're funny, Ben - come on. They move through the crowd.
C: VINTNER

C: TAMARA
D: Besides, I want to show you off.

D: Can we get out of here?
C: TAMARA
D: Wait.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 58A. She abandons him. Glen has turned away. Ben stands amid the nice chat, like a man being tortured. Meanwhile, Tamara is jumping the queue at Nicholas' desk.
C: ARMY GEEK
D: In Field of Tares, you made Fred a corporal. But there's no such thing in the Royal Artillery. They call them bombardiers.

N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 59.

S: INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM.
N: Jody sniffs Ben's aftershave, longingly. Casey plucks his guitar. They listen to the note in hushed awe. Jody puts her foot into one of Tamara's killer stilettos. She picks up Ben's drumsticks and kisses them, reverently.

D: We gotta live the dream, Casey. Live the dream... Jody and Casey jump up and down on the unmade bed. Jody pulls a black T-shirt from under a pillow. She holds it to her face.
C: JODY
D: Ben... Casey is looking out of the window. The yellow Porsche is heading up the lane.

S: INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN.
N: Tamara and Ben are having a heated discussion.
C: BEN
D: Why don't you sell it like you keep saying?
C: TAMARA
D: Because... I've started writing.
C: BEN
D: You can write anywhere.
C: TAMARA
D: But this is proper. Not just stuff for the paper. 'It's about my teens - and is working for me here.
C: BEN
D: Well it might be memory lane for you but it's doing my fucking head in. I want London. I want some Urban, OK? Are you with me or what? Cos I've had it with this place. Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed.
C: TAMARA
D: Of course I'm with you...
C: BEN
D: It's drab. It's depressing. And every time I look out of the window I see Andy's arse - what's that about?
S: EXT. NEXT DAY. STONEFIELD - ANDY'S CORRUGATED SHACK.
N: Andy is bending down, the top of his arse peeking out in the morning sun. Ben stares at it with distaste. Andy is plucking a goose, putting all his frustration into it.
C: BEN
D: We're leaving. Thank God. Andy looks at him.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 61.
C: BEN
D: Tamara says you sell Christmas geese.
C: ANDY
D: Yep.
C: BEN
D: Can I have one?
C: ANDY
D: Right now?
C: BEN
D: Yeah. Andy smirks, pointing at a big white duck.
C: ANDY
D: That one's spare.
C: BEN
D: Is that a goose?
C: ANDY
D: You can take it now if you like.
N: BEN (DISGUSTED) Oh come off it.
C: ANDY
D: What?
C: BEN
D: It's fucking alive.
C: ANDY
D: Oh, you want it from Tesco, all plucked and headless sitting on a bandage. Ben's curiosity gets the better of him.
C: BEN
D: How d'you do it then? Andy points towards an upturned traffic cone, held in place by a metal frame.
C: ANDY
D: Gently put it's head down there; then quick in the skull with an air rifle. Pluck it while it's warm, little pot to catch all the blood -
C: BEN
D: Do you enjoy doing that?
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 61A.
C: ANDY
D: No, but in my low wage economy, this flock's worth a lot.
C: BEN
D: You're a sick fuck, Andy. Andy has had enough.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62.
C: ANDY
D: Grow up.
N: BEN (SQUARING UP) What did you say? Andy stands. He's at least two inches taller than Ben.
C: ANDY
D: I said grow up, little drummer boy. Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods.
C: ANDY
D: Tamara rang me this morning. Said to finish the house. It goes on the market in the spring and that's it; over.
C: GLEN
D: Why does the asshole always get the girl? He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back.
C: ANDY
D: Come on. Or you'll miss that train.
S: INT. SIX WEEKS LATER. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM.
N: Snow falling outside. Jody and Casey are in school uniform. Jody curled up on the bed; Casey at Tamara's PC. The room has been redecorated.
C: JODY
D: It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll be an event. I'll be wearing like a gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada. Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and... We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door frame, giving her a smouldering look.
C: JODY
D: He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all taut over his buff bod and underneath Calvin Klein Boxers, black. Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if he's found the love of his life.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62A.

E: V.O. CONT'D
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 63. Ben lifts Jody on to the bed. They marvel at each other. He bends down to kiss her.
C: JODY
D: And he tries to stop himself but I'm a vision and he gets drawn into my power and it'll be like Uhhh... But also respectful. And my `V' plates will melt into nothing. She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC.

C: JODY
D: Are you listening?
E: CONT'D
C: CASEY
D: I like this.
C: JODY
D: What?
C: CASEY
D: There's this bit right, where her dad takes her for dinner and she thinks it's some big treat but what he's doing, right, is telling her he's leaving them. And she, right, she's gutted and she yaks all her food into a napkin and puts it on his plate.
C: JODY
D: So?
C: CASEY
D: It's painful. But funny. It's about her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad, Jode.
C: JODY

D: What?
C: BEN
D: Isn't it obvious who sent it? That tosser Andy Cobb.

D: Fuck's sake.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 70. He pushes her away, harder than he meant to. She lands on the sofa, shocked. BEN (CONT'D) (WITHOUT APOLOGY) I'm taking the dog for a crap. He grabs the lead and opens the door. It slams shut. Tamara's dread overwhelms her.

C: BETH
D: Why's your father on there - and poor Andy? It's so tasteless.
C: POPPY
D: You know how subversive she is. She once sent me a valentine from Prince Harry - and I believed it. It's her sense of humour; she likes causing trouble. At school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift.
E: helping with the sheets
C: BETH
D: She taught you to shoplift?

C: CASEY
D: How come she's with a different bloke every week and when Lesley Hunt's sister shagged Jeff Dobson - just once, after he lied he loved her - she gets called a dirty slag.
C: JODY
D: That's cos she does it in five star resorts around the world - and not The Feathers carpark. Over the page, Ben canoodling in a freezing park with Fran.

S: 109C INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109C
N: The inside of the house has been transformed by Andy. The drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone, replaced by warm tones which bring out the beauty of the house. Tamara wanders through. She turns around taking it all in. She never knew the house was so beautiful.
S: INT. DAY. EWEDOWN - JODY'S BEDROOM.
N: Jody is weeping into her mobile phone.

N: Tamara's car pulls up. Jody and Casey wheel around closer on their bikes. Tamara tries the door. The pub is shut. She looks in through the glass and sees Zoe up on the bar, clinging to Andy in a long embrace. Tamara is frozen. Andy kisses Zoe, long and tender. Tamara turns. She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare mutely as she drives away.

D: You can throw me right out. Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Just say and I'll go. She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is big and fatherly and comforting. Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real, vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the door. Tamara closes her eyes. Their kisses become more urgent.
S: INT. DUSK. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM.
N: Tamara is lying in Nicholas' arms in the growing darkness. He looks blissfully post-coital. Tamara is gazing ahead. A tear rolls down her cheek. It lands on Nicholas' chest.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Are you crying?
C: TAMARA
D: No. Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Don't cry. Am I really that bad? Tamara shakes her head, glad of him.
C: TAMARA
D: I'm just not myself.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 76.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Yes you are. She looks up at him.
C: NICHOLAS
D: You're relentlessly, rudely, uncompromisingly yourself. A smile appears on Tamara's face.
E: CONT'D
C: TAMARA
D: I used to watch you out of my window helping your daughter learn to skateboard up the lane. Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Is that why you're crying?
C: TAMARA
D: No.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Am I here as revenge on your ex?
C: TAMARA
D: I don't know why you're here. Why are you here, Nicholas?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Because... since you climbed over that stile in the summer I haven't thought about very much else. She doesn't believe him.
C: TAMARA
D: You can use me in one of your books.
S: INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL.

C: TAMARA
D: Isn't life complicated enough? Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her.
S: INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN.
N: Nicholas strolls in. He's ecstatically happy. Beth is getting something out of the Aga.
C: BETH
D: Oh poor you - was it awful?
C: NICHOLAS
D: Bloody terrible. Didn't move till well past Chiswick. But look, I nipped into Fortnums... He hands her a package.
C: BETH
D: All my favourite teas - Oh! He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth.
C: BETH
D: My goodness. You feel like my buzzy toothbrush just after I've charged it up. You should go up to London more often.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Maybe I will... Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig. Do carry on...
C: LUCETTA
D: I'm trying this magic realist bit at the end of chapter three, where the characters slowly turn into
N: BIRDS -
C: NICHOLAS
D: That sounds very innovative...
C: LUCETTA
D: Do you think so? It's sort of the key to the structure, which I'm thinking of as a nest shape...
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 78. Nicholas listens benevolently as Lucetta shares. His good humour is so out of his recent character that Beth watches him with increasing unease. There is something in her eyes akin to suspicion. SPRING. POSY DRAWING.
S: EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE STATION / BETH'S CAR.
N: Beth is putting Glen's luggage into the boot.
C: GLEN
D: So after two years of radio silence I contact my editor. And she loves - I mean loves the chapters I did in the fall.

E: shot the same way as the earlier scene
C: GLEN
D: Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers! Let's egg the self-regarding sacks of shit.
S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN.
N: Glen is helping Beth prepare the evening meal. They are both animated, enjoying one another's company. GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 79.
C: GLEN
D: There's this theory he gave his wife syphilis, right? No evidence but the symptoms fit. The poor woman gets kind of eccentric and moves her bed up to their attic -
C: BETH
D: The bastard -
C: GLEN
D: Meanwhile, Hardy falls in love with a woman who is thirty nine years younger than him.
C: BETH

D: Thomas Hardy.
C: NICHOLAS

D: Yes, actually. Nicholas returns to the paper.
C: BETH
D: He gave his wife syphilis.
C: NICHOLAS

E: Points at the screen
C: TAMARA
D: I'm well-known for it.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Seriously. It's very moving. Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified.
C: TAMARA
D: Thank you.
C: NICHOLAS
D: So... have I done my duty?
C: TAMARA
D: Admirably.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Now do I get my treat? Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen.
C: TAMARA
D: You are so cheesy. Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste.
S: EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. BUS SHELTER.
N: Jody and Casey share a magazine and a spliff in the bus stop.
C: JODY
D: Zero Ben sightings in two whole months.

N: (MORE) GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 81.

D: She's probably topped herself. I would if Ben dumped me.
C: CASEY
D: Jode. Don't say that. What if she's done something?
C: JODY
D: Like got in the bath with her heated tongs?
C: CASEY
D: Like taken a stack of pills? We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her mouth coated with dried froth and vomit.
C: JODY
D: D'you think she might be lying there all choked in vomit and drug froth?
C: CASEY
D: That'd be dire.
C: JODY
D: If we find her we'll get in the papers.

D: Oh my God.

To her surprise, she sees Andy on the threshold, looking spruced up and handsome. The contrast with Nicholas couldn't be more apparent. She finds herself genuinely pleased to see him.
C: TAMARA
D: Andy... Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of disappointment at seeing her alive.
C: JODY
D: Bollocks.
C: ANDY
D: Haven't seen you for a while. Thought you might be ill or something. Or depressed or -

C: TAMARA
D: I'd love to, but...
C: ANDY
D: Shake off the winter blues. Come celebrate the spring.
C: TAMARA
D: I can't... I'm kind of on one with my writing. Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is unaware that he has seen.
C: TAMARA
D: Can we do it soon though? I'd really like to; just not right now. He nods at her in disbelief.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY (COOLLY) Sure. He turns on his heels and goes. Tamara closes the door. Outside, Andy is leaning over his land-rover, sickened.
C: JODY
D: D'you think he's in with a chance?
C: CASEY
D: No way.
C: JODY
D: Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.

D: It's him. From Stonefield.
C: JODY
D: The dirty cheating sod.
S: INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN.

E: all for Tamara
C: LADY IN THE CROWD
D: No!
C: NICHOLAS
D: Inchcombe will be meeting a very sticky end. And it's one murder I'm really looking forward to.
C: LADY IN THE CROWD
D: How could you?
C: INTERVIEWER
D: This might be a good moment to take a few questions. Yes, the lady in the apron...
C: BETH
D: You write a lot about adultery. Is that from personal experience? Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Madam, what a saucy question!
C: BETH
D: Why do you cheat persistently on your wife? Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly humiliated. He decides not.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Because she lets me. Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it.
S: EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE GROUNDS BY THE MARQUEE.
N: Tamara is striding away from the Marquee, red with shame. Nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up.

N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 96.
C: NICHOLAS
D: You're right. I can't go on using her, lying to her. Won't be fun but I've got to do it.
N: TAMARA LISTEN -
C: NICHOLAS
D: I don't feel alive with Beth! I haven't been living for years. She's had me smothered in a comfy blanket -
C: TAMARA
D: Nicholas, listen to me. She makes him look at her.
C: TAMARA
D: We had fun. But it's wrong. And it's over.
E: CONT'D
C: NICHOLAS
D: But... I'm in love with you.
C: TAMARA
D: I'm sorry. Nicholas looks as if he's just been punched.
C: NICHOLAS
D: No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck supper!
C: TAMARA
D: Will you keep it down?
C: NICHOLAS
D: My God, you're cold hearted.
C: TAMARA
D: Please don't shout.
C: NICHOLAS
D: You don't feel a thing, do you?
C: TAMARA
D: I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing away inside all the time. Why do I do these things? What am I doing with you? The question hangs between them.
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 97.
C: NICHOLAS
D: There's someone else isn't there...
C: TAMARA
D: Oh for God's sake.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Not that narcissist drummer?
C: TAMARA
D: Goodbye.
C: NICHOLAS
D: It's that ignorant lunk isn't it? That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.
C: TAMARA
D: Andy Cobb is a far better man than you! In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away. Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful distance. He approaches. Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Thank you.

N: I/E. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - HALL / TAMARA'S BEDROOM Jody knocks on the door. It's open. She pushes it.

C: BEN
D: Hello Jody... Jody spins round. The door closes. Ben is standing behind it. He is wearing a tight black T-shirt; the man of her dreams.
C: BEN
D: Dog minder? I guessed you might be the somebody who's been getting in here, pissing about, sending e-mails and fucking people up. D'you know what I'm saying? You've been breaking in.

C: BEN
D: So that's nice. Least someone does.
C: JODY
D: I used to lie awake thinking about you being here... in Ewedown, the bumhole of nowhere. It was the best thing to happen ever. I've been so in love with you. And when you left I couldn't bear it. I thought the valentine would make you come back...
C: BEN
D: D'you still love me, Jody? Even though I wanna lock you up in a young offenders institution? Jody nods, unsure.
E: CONT'D
C: BEN
D: What would you do for me then? Would you do anything, like a proper fan? Jody looks at him, scared. She manages a nod. Ben approaches her.

S: INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS.
N: Beth is taking Nicholas' awards down and chucking them in a box. Glen is trying to save them from smashing.

C: BETH
D: Breeding goats? Baking fucking biscuits? It's meaningless! Beth bawls. Glen holds her.
C: GLEN
D: Beth... When I was lost with my book you helped me more than you know. You asked who I was writing it for... He starts to really hold her. The sobbing subsides.
C: GLEN
D: You. He kisses her. Beth looks at Glen; a revelation. The future opens up. She kisses him back.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Excuse me. Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey.
C: NICHOLAS

N: BETH LIAR -

D: Please don't tell my mum.
C: BEN
D: I knew it was boring round here but for fuck's sake...

C: BEN
D: Jody. Jody, shamefaced, prepares to cough up.
S: EXT. DAY. A FIELD.
N: Boss is lolloping round. He stops. The whole herd of cows is staring at him. Boss regards the animals with curiosity. He wags his tail. Will they play? He starts to bark.
S: EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS.
N: Nicholas sees Glen sitting on the edge of an old rusting trough. Fury overwhelms him.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you.
C: GLEN
D: It's Glen, asshole. Nicholas is stomping through the mud and cowshit.
C: NICHOLAS
D: You fucking devious bastard.
C: GLEN
D: I'm devious? I'm a bastard?
C: NICHOLAS
D: You think I haven't noticed how you've been worming your way in? You keep your hands off my wife, you low-rent pedant.

C: GLE
D: I can give her / integrity!
C: NICHOLAS
D: Obscure literary shit not worth ten
N: PENCE -
C: GLEN
D: You know if I made my pile fantasizing rapes and homicides I wouldn't be so proud.
N: NICHOLAS (SHOVING HIM) You cunt.
C: GLEN
D: Fuck you. Glen grabs him round the middle. They struggle like overgrown schoolboys.
C: NICHOLAS
D: Beth'll come to her senses. You need an income to run Stonefield. And mine's bigger than yours! Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.
E: CONT'D
C: GLEN
D: Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk about this like grown men. Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.
C: GLEN
D: Oh my God. Nicholas... Glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat, the drumming of hooves. The herd of cows come over the brow of the hill and down towards them. Boss is chasing them, barking. The beasts are terrified, stampeding.
E: CONT'D
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 104. They are heading straight for the trough. Nicholas is trying to get up on his knees.
C: GLEN
D: Nicholas! Get up! Run! Glen puts out a hand to help him. But before Nicholas notices, he instinctively retrieves it. Glen turns on his heels and runs, terrified. He throws himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past. They disappear down the hill, Boss still behind them. Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving. Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident been seen? No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to touch him. Fear overwhelms him. He runs away.

D: It was you? Jody can't look her in the eye.
C: BEN
D: Jody has explained that she did it out of deep love for me. To Ben's astonishment, Tamara smiles. He grabs his moment.
C: BEN
D: Tamara... It's an apology. Tamara takes Ben's hand and leads him through to a dresser in the hall. She opens it.
E: CONT'D
C: TAMARA

C: TAMARA
D: You'll get to it through Byley farm. His skull is broken. It's smashed. No I haven't but... it's obvious. His wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from his face with water from the trough.
C: TAMARA
D: They're on their way... Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. She touches Beth's shoulder.
C: TAMARA
D: Beth? Help is coming - Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies out. It slams into Tamara's face. Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood.
C: TAMARA
D: It's broken! - She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the biggest wake-up call of her life. Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done - then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.

N: Tamara sits beside a dewpond, gingerly washing the blood off her face.

D: I'd better get up to Stonefield. Come with me. We'll get this sorted.

C: ANDY
D: Then get Ben to take you to London. Make sure he looks after you. Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead.

S: 171B INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. GLEN'S ROOM. 171B
N: Glen, sick with dread, is drying his face with a towel. He picks up his muddy shoes and clothes, wraps them in a bag and shoves them in his case. His eyes alight on his poster of Thomas Hardy. He pulls it down.
S: EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN.
N: Ben and the girls have dug a grave for Boss. Casey is putting flowers on the top. Ben starts to cry like a broken-hearted little boy. Jody instinctively puts her arms round him. The girls are immensely moved. Jody looks over at Casey. She MOUTHS:
C: JODY
D: Pap me! Pap me! Casey waits until Ben is not looking. Then she takes pictures with her mobile phone. Jody cradles Ben in her arms, doing her best moved-but-sultry pose. Casey tries not to laugh. Jody is ecstatic. The man of her dreams is in her arms. Her wish has come true.
S: 172A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE COURTYARD. 172A

D: I shooed him away! The police said it was an accident but...

C: GLEN
D: Beth. I have to tell you...
N: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 110-111. For a moment, confession and silence hang in the balance. Glen opens his mouth to speak.

D: Glen. Stay with me. Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future together. Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all. Beth leans into him, seeking comfort.
