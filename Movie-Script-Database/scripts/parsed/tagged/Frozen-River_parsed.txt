T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - DAY
N: A sign reads "Bridge to Canada." A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St. Lawrence River. Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs officials inspect and question impatient drivers. Beyond them a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for you".
S: EXT. BELOW THE BRIDGE - DAY
N: The river stretches for miles in either direction, frozen, and still with trees on either side.
S: EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD, MASSENA NEW YORK - DAY
N: RAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open, smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in the cold morning air. Her bare feet rest on the cold ground. Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE. Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride. Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land. After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR., leans out the trailer door.
C: T.J.
D: We're out of Capt'n Crunch.
N: His breath is visible in the cold.
C: RAY
D: Just give him toast.
C: T.J.
D: We got no butter, we got no jelly.
N: Ray is out of ideas. He expects her to move, but she stays still. He looks around the yard.
C: T.J.
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: RAY
D: Listening for the trucks.
C: T.J.
D: Are they really coming?
C: RAY
D: Yeah.
C: T.J.
D: Where's dad?
N: She is silent.
C: T.J.
D: Where's dad?
E: CONT'D says it slow
N: She looks at him.
C: RAY
D: I don't know how he found it, T.J.
C: T.J.
D: Found what?
N: Ray takes a drag off her cigarette. T.J. walks over to the car.
C: T.J.
D: The money?
E: CONT'D
C: RAY
D: I locked it in my glove compartment.
N: T.J. looks in at the OPEN AND EMPTY GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
C: T.J.
D: That was stupid.
C: RAY
D: Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened.
C: T.J.
D: Did you tell him you had it?
C: RAY
D: Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.
C: T.J.
D: Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!? That's the stupidest place you could have put it.
C: RAY
D: He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay!
C: T.J.
D: Did he leave anything?
N: She shakes her head.
C: T.J.
D: What are you gonna do?
E: CONT'D
C: RAY
D: Nothing.
C: T.J.
D: You could look for him?
C: RAY
D: He could be anywhere.
C: T.J.
D: We should look for him.
C: RAY
D: Where?
C: T.J.
D: The Rez,
C: RAY
D: With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now.
C: T.J.
D: So let's go, let's find him before he blows it all.
N: (CONT'D)
C: RAY
D: I can't.
C: T.J.
D: What do you mean?
C: RAY
D: I just can't do it anymore.
C: T.J.
D: But he'll lose it all.
C: RAY
D: T.J., we can't make him stop.
C: T.J.
D: He stole our money. Call the Troopers.
C: RAY
D: It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too.
C: T.J.
D: So you're just gonna sit there?
C: RAY
D: I'm sorry.
N: In the distance the RUMBLE OF TRUCKS. Ray hears it. It gets louder.
C: T.J.
D: Another Christmas in the tin crapper.
N: T.J. goes into the shed and slams the door. Ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer.
S: INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY
N: She looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized RENTAWORLD furniture including a big screen TV. An enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her eye. In it, her husband, TROY, SR., 40, wearing a forced smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture. Ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into a pair or jeans and a t-shirt. A sleepy-eyed, toe-headed boy, RICKY, 5, walks in, shirtless in pajama bottoms, eyes shining.
C: RICKY
D: Is it here?
N: Ray stops what she's doing when she sees him and kneels down.
C: RAY
D: Hey, little sleepy head.
C: RICKY
D: Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.
N: He drags a suitcase full of plastic dinosaurs around the corner. The RUMBLE OUTSIDE GROWS LOUDER. Ricky BOLTS out of the bedroom and down the hall to the trailer door.
C: RAY
D: Wait a sec-
N: He bursts into the yard where:
S: EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY
N: A PICK-UP TRUCK DRAPED WITH A "WIDE LOAD" banner leads TWO SEMIS hauling halves of a DOUBLE WIDE MOBILE HOME wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind. Ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly, trying not to pee himself. T.J. comes out of the shed. The Doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard. GUY VERSAILLES, pot-bellied, in a green velour running suit, squeezes out of his truck. On the door: "MASSENA MODULAR AND MOBILE HOMES, NEW AND RECONDITIONED." Ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and tries to climb the side of it. The TRUCK DRIVER looks down from his cab.
C: T.J.
D: Get down.
E: to Ricky
N: Ray peeks out the kitchen curtain. After a moment she comes out of the trailer, with a pasted-on smile.
C: RAY
D: We're all ready for ya'.
N: She points to the new concrete foundation. He consults a clipboard.
C: VERSAILLES
D: We'll need the balloon payment to unload.
N: T.J. looks at Ray.
C: RAY
D: We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-
C: VERSAILLES
D: Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?
C: RAY
D: It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back-
C: VERSAILLES
D: When's he gonna be back?
C: RAY
D: As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you.
N: T.J. could crawl out of his skin.
C: VERSAILLES
D: This is the second time you've dragged me out here. If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit.
E: ironic smile
N: He walks toward his car. She follows him.
C: RAY
D: Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house-
N: He gets in the car.
C: VERSAILLES
D: Call me when you have the balloon payment.
N: He makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's rev their engines and grind into reverse.
C: RAY
D: I'll call you...
N: Her voice is DROWNED OUT by REVVING engines. Ricky rushes to her.
C: RICKY
D: Wait, where are they going?
N: She takes his face in her hands.
C: RAY
D: Listen to me. We'll get them back.
C: RICKY
D: But why are they leaving?
C: RAY
D: Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey.
C: RICKY
D: That's our house!
N: He BREAKS AWAY from her and RUNS down the road chasing after the semis. Ray chases after Ricky until he runs out of steam and stops, panting. She catches up to him and tries to hug him. He pushes her away. She gets down on her knees and takes his face in her hands.
C: RAY
D: We're gonna get it back.
N: She picks him up and walks back to the trailer. Ricky looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down the road.
C: RAY
D: You better hurry or you're going to miss the bus. Let's get your clothes on, Ricky.
E: CONT'D to T.J.
N: T.J. just stares at her.
C: T.J.
D: I can get a job you know.
C: RAY
D: You're 15, T.J.
C: T.J.
D: They won't ask any questions.
C: RAY
D: You're finishing school.
C: T.J.
D: Come on, you don't think we can live on what you make at All for a Dollar do you?
C: RAY
D: You're going to school.
N: She goes inside. T.J. follows.
C: T.J.
D: I bet I could make more than you do.
N: She ignores him.
S: INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY
N: Ray helps Ricky into his clothes and puts his backpack on his back.
C: RICKY
D: Where's daddy?
N: Ray and T.J. look at each other.
C: RAY
D: He'll be back.
C: T.J.
D: Aren't we even gonna look for him?
C: RAY
D: No! I'm going to work and you're going to school.
C: T.J.
D: That's it?
C: RAY
D: The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same.
C: RICKY
D: Where did he go?
C: RAY
D: He had to take a business trip.
N: T.J. rolls his eyes.
C: T.J.
D: Aren't you even gonna look for him?
C: RAY
D: And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack.
N: T.J. stares, sullen.
C: RAY
D: Go on!
E: CONT'D
C: RICKY
D: When is daddy coming home?
C: RAY
D: I don't know, Ricky.
C: T.J.
D: I can't believe you're not even gonna look for him.
C: RAY
D: Where? Where do I look?
E: He can't answer
C: T.J.
D: The reservation.
C: RAY
D: I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now.
N: She helps Ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss.
C: T.J.
D: The glove compartment. That's so stupid.
E: shakes his head
C: RAY
D: You're going to school.
N: He follows Ricky out the door to catch the school bus rolling up out front. Suddenly, Ray remembers:
C: RAY
D: Wait, wait.
E: CONT'D
N: They turn around. She digs in her pockets.
C: RAY
D: Here. Lunch money.
E: CONT'D
N: They take it and keep running for the bus. Ray looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes. She takes out her second to last one. She lights it and takes out her mascara. She tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears keep getting in the way.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ALL FOR A DOLLAR STORE - DAY
N: RAY stacks shelves with a knock-off version of plastic "My Little Pony" in a messy aisle of boxes. MATT, 22, her boss, bone thin with bad skin walks by.
C: RAY
D: Matt. Could I talk to you?
E: soft
N: He looks at her.
C: RAY
D: I need to come on full-time.
E: CONT'D
N: Matt blinks with a blank expression then:
C: MATT
D: I see you as a short timer.
C: RAY
D: What is that?
C: MATT
D: A short timer. Not here for long, not really committed.
N: Ray follows him to the stock room.
C: RAY
D: When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago.
N: He opens a can of RED BULL and takes a sip.
C: MATT
D: It's my opinion.
C: RAY
D: Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late.
N: He stares blankly at her. She can think of nothing else to say. He walks out. Ray resumes unpacking ponies. A moment later PAT, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. As Pat hangs up her coat, Ray glimpses a tatoo just above her low riding pants with the words "How You Doin'?". Ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and heads out the back door.
C: RAY
D: See ya' tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
S: INT./EXT HORIZON, ROUTE 37 - DAY
N: Ray drives down a two-lane highway. It is empty flat land but for a few trailer homes and barns. She passes a lonely sign: "BRIDGE TO CANADA." Up ahead another sign: "AKWESASNE LAND OF THE MOHAWK." From the car, the Reservation consists of shabby houses with no siding, tax-free gas stations and dive bars with homemade signs. Ray slows a little to check out the parking lots scanning for her husband's car. Up ahead she sees a sign: "WOLF MART TAX FREE GAS AND CIGARETTES.
S: EXT. WOLF MART GAS STATION - DAY
N: Ray pulls in to the combo gas station, restaurant and mini mart. A MOHAWK TEENAGER wearing a bandana RUNS out to the CAR without a coat, rubbing his hands together to ward off the cold.
C: MOHAWK TEENAGER
D: Fill it up?
N: She rolls down the window, digging for change under the seat of her car. She counts it out.
C: RAY
D: Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four.
C: MOHAWK TEENAGER
D: Two seventy four.
N: He nods and goes to the pump. She finds a wadded up five dollar bill.
C: RAY
D: Make that seven seventy four.
E: yells out window
N: She spots a sign for "TRAILWAYS" bus in the window.
C: RAY
D: Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night?
E: CONT'D
C: MOHAWK TEENAGER
D: Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked until 9 PM. You can ask inside.
N: Ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for a few older Mohawk women.
C: RAY
D: No, that's okay.
C: MOHAWK TEENAGER
D: Did you want to support our Mosquito Lacrosse League. It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids three to five.
N: Ray shakes her head.
C: MOHAWK TEENAGER
D: Thanks, anyway. Have a good day.
E: CONT'D
S: INT./EXT. ROUTE 37 INDIAN RESERVATION - DAY
N: Ray continues down the highway through the reservation. She comes to a huge warehouse, the "MOHAWK BINGO PALACE." She glances over at the sea of cars surrounding it. At the end of a row she spots it: a BLUE ACCLAIM. Ray abruptly turns in.
S: EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Ray pulls up alongside the Acclaim and recognizes it by the "EASY DOES IT" bumper sticker. She gets out and looks inside. There is a small plastic T- Rex on the floor of the backseat. She leans against the car for a moment.
C: RAY
D: Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you...
N: After a moment Ray looks up at the Bingo Palace and heads for the entrance.
C: RAY
D: You son of a bitch!
E: CONT'D

D: It's $5 dollars for admission.
C: RAY

C: TICKET TAKER
D: I'm gonna need the five.
C: RAY
D: I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there.
C: TICKET TAKER

C: RAY
D: He's gambling away the money for our house.
C: TICKET TAKER
D: What does he look like?
C: RAY
D: Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.
C: TICKET TAKER
D: He's not in there.
C: RAY
D: Can I just look?
C: TICKET TAKER
D: I told you, lady, he's not in there.
N: Ray walks away. The ticket taker watches her.
S: EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE, PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Ray walks out of the front entrance back across the parking lot toward the Horizon through rows of cars... Across the parking lot, LILA LITTLEWOLF, 20, a Mohawk girl with long black hair bursts out of the "Employees Entrance" and hurries across the parking lot pulling off her scratch card apron as she walks. Ray catches sight of her, but before Ray reaches the Horizon, Lila reaches the ACCLAIM, GETS IN IT AND BACKS OUT.
C: RAY
D: Hey!
N: But Lila drives off. Ray JUMPS back in the Horizon and TAKES OFF AFTER HER.
S: EXT. RESERVATION ROADS - DAY
N: Ray follows the Acclaim down Route 37 and catches sight of it turning off on a dirt road. Ray makes the corner just in time to catch sight of the Acclaim bouncing off on a path through the woods. Ray follows it through the woods to a clearing: the Acclaim stops in front of a rusted out BUBBLE CAMPER. Lila gets out. Ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her window.
C: RAY
D: That's my car.
N: Lila SPINS around.
C: LILA
D: Huh?
C: RAY
D: What are you doing with my car?
E: points to the Acclaim
N: Lila fingers the keys in her hand.
C: LILA
D: That? I found it.
C: RAY
D: You stole it.
C: LILA
D: The keys were in it.
C: RAY
D: So you just took it...?
N: Lila goes in the bubble camper and shuts the door behind her. Ray gets out of the Horizon and walks up to the camper door and takes out her cell phone.
C: RAY
D: We'll just see what the troopers say about that.
E: CONT'D
C: LILA
D: Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here. This is Mohawk territory.
E: O.S. From inside camper
N: Ray stops dialing closes up her phone, then goes to her car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper.
C: RAY
D: You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now.
E: knocks with the gun
N: There is no reponse. Ray waits for a moment and then:
C: RAY
D: Troy, are you in there?
E: CONT'D low voice
N: There is no response.
C: RAY
D: If you're in there you better come out.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY
N: Lila sits on an army cot in the dingy camper next to a lamp on the floor. Her clothes are scattered among empty Pringles cans.
C: RAY
D: Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit. I think we need to talk about this, so come on out. Troy? Troy?
E: O.S. tentative, controlled pause Pause
S: EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY
N: Ray aims the gun and FIRES into the camper door.
S: INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY
N: The shock of the blast throws Lila off the cot. She looks at the SMOKING HOLE.
C: RAY
D: I'm not kidding, honey, come on out.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY
N: Keeping behind the door for cover, Lila opens it. Ray looks inside: there is no sign of Troy.
C: LILA
D: The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses.
E: from behind the door
N: Ray looks at her.
C: RAY
D: This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys!
N: Lila throws the keys out the door. Ray picks them up off the ground. Lila shuts the door with her foot.
S: EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY
N: Ray gets in the Horizon and pulls it in behind the Acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope. She ties one end to the Acclaim's back fender and the other to the Horizon's front fender. Lila watches out the camper window. Ray gets in the Acclaim and starts it up slowly TOWING the Horizon a few feet before the rope SNAPS. Ray gets out and looks at the broken rope. She begins digging in the trunk for more rope. Lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole.
C: LILA
D: This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this.
C: RAY
D: Then you should quit stealing cars.
E: over her shoulder
C: LILA
D: I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus.
N: Ray stops.
C: RAY
D: Did you see where the bus was headed?
C: LILA
D: New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure.
N: Ray RE-TIES the tow line with the remaining rope. This time the Horizon goes an inch or two before the rope SNAPS. Ray gets out.
C: RAY
D: Shit!
E: under her breath
N: Ray RIFLES through the trunk for more rope. "Home on the Range" plays on the cell phone in Ray's back pocket. Lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to Ray's conversation from the doorway. Ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of the cars. Ray gets back in the Acclaim and tries TOWING the Horizon once again. This time the right side of the front fender SNAPS OFF and droops to one side. Ray gets out and looks at Lila.
C: RAY
D: I'm not leaving this here.
E: CONT'D
C: LILA
D: I got a friend who might buy that.
E: points at the Acclaim
C: RAY
D: It's not for sale.
C: LILA
D: He'll pay more than it's worth.
N: Ray ignores her.
C: LILA
D: Maybe two thousand.
E: CONT'D
C: RAY
D: Why's that?
C: LILA
D: He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks.
N: Ray thinks about it.
C: LILA
D: He don't need papers or anything.
E: CONT'D
C: RAY
D: Does he use them to rob banks or something?
N: Lila shrugs.
C: LILA
D: All I know is he pays good for a car like this.
C: RAY
D: Where does he live?
C: LILA
D: Through the woods. Not far.
C: RAY
D: What's in it for you?
C: LILA
D: He'll give me something for finding it.
C: RAY
D: If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this.
C: LILA
D: Yeah.
S: INT. ACCLAIM IN RESERVATION WOODS - DAY
N: Ray drives with one hand and holds the gun with the other. It is pointed at Lila in the passenger seat.
C: LILA
D: Turn up there.
C: RAY
D: Where?
C: LILA
D: Where that stump is.
N: Ray makes the turn with one hand and the car bounces through an overgrown path in the woods. Ray reaches the stump.
C: RAY
D: There's no road.
E: nervous
C: LILA
D: There's a path.
N: Ray hesitates.
C: LILA
D: It's not far.
E: CONT'D
N: Ray turns and drives into deeper woods. The gun jiggles around in Ray's hand as they bounce along between the trees. Lila tries to ignore it.

N: The car emerges from the woods at a BOAT RAMP leading to a mile-wide section of the FROZEN ST. LAWRENCE RIVER.
S: INT. ACCLAIM AT BOAT RAMP - DAY
N: Ray looks out at the ice. Tire tracks make a path across the snow-covered surface between carefully set out CUT EVERGREEN TREES.
C: LILA
D: Not too fast. There's ruts.
C: RAY
D: I'm not crossing that!
C: LILA
D: Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees. There's no black ice.
C: RAY
D: That's Canada.
C: LILA
D: No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides of the river.
C: RAY
D: What about the border patrol?
C: LILA
D: There's no border.
C: RAY
D: I'm still not crossing that.
C: LILA
D: Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've seen semis cross it.
N: Ray looks at Lila suspiciously.
C: LILA
D: The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that. .
E: CONT'D points at the gun
N: Suddenly, A TRUCK driven by a MOHAWK TEENAGER ROARS out of the woods and SWERVES around the Acclaim FISHTAILING then SPEEDING out across the ice.
C: LILA
D: They plow it and everything.
E: CONT'D
N: Cautiously, Ray lets off the brake and rolls down the boat ramp towards the smooth surface of the river.
C: RAY

E: under her breath
C: LILA
D: Not too fast, there are ruts.
S: EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY
N: The Acclaim moves across the smooth surface of the river.
S: INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY
N: Ray stares straight ahead clutching the wheel, barely breathing. Lila glances at the gun in Ray's hand, then out at the river, unfazed. They reach the midpoint of the river and pass it silently.
C: LILA
D: You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank.
N: Ray speeds up. The Acclaim bounces up the steep bank.
C: LILA
D: It's just on the other side of those trees.
E: CONT'D

N: Ray and Lila pull into a used-car lot surrounded by a chain link fence. There is no sign of life. Ray stops.
C: LILA
D: Honk the horn.
N: Ray honks. Suddenly, from under a gutted truck, A HUGE BLACK DOG, part wolf, SPRINGS onto the hood of the Acclaim. Ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog. Lila GRABS the gun out of her hand and points it at Ray.
C: LILA
D: Just keep your mouth shut.
E: CONT'D
N: Ray stares at the snarling dog.
C: LILA
D: Just keep it shut. Okay?
E: CONT'D
N: Ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog. Lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out of sight. Out of the garage comes JIMMY, 33, a stocky Mohawk, eating a sandwich. Jimmy looks suspiciously at Ray before he sees Lila. Thunder growls.
C: JIMMY
D: Thunder! SHUT UP!.
N: The dog GROWLS ferociously at Ray.
C: JIMMY
D: Get back under there!
E: CONT'D
N: Thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the trunk. Jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car. Lila rolls down her window.
C: LILA
D: Hi, Jimmy.
N: Jimmy glances at Ray.
C: JIMMY
D: He don't like whites, Lila.
C: LILA
D: Sorry.
C: JIMMY
D: And your late.
C: LILA
D: Sorry.
C: JIMMY
D: I shouldn't even be dealing with you.
C: LILA
D: I know. Sorry.
N: He hands her a paper bag. Jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door. TWO YOUNG CHINESE MEN in cheap jogging suits follow him out, looking around.
S: INT. ACCLAIM JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - DAY
N: Lila hands the paper bag to Ray and points the gun at her, keeping it low and out of sight.
C: LILA

C: LILA
D: How much is there?
E: CONT'D
C: RAY
D: Twelve hundred.
N: Lila opens the glove compartment and presses the trunk release. Jimmy motions to the Chinese men to get in the trunk. Jimmy shuts it. He taps twice on the hood of the car and walks back to the garage.
C: LILA
D: Let's go.
E: to Ray
C: RAY
D: Wait, who the fuck are they?
C: LILA

E: O.S.
N: Ray stares across the room at a pile of Troy's dirty flannel shirts. She gets up and picks up the pile to move it to the closet, but feels something hard. From a shirt pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards. She throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her cigarettes. She takes out a glossy picture of her double wide dream home, "The Commodore" a gleaming pre-fab structure with a landscaped yard and a family with paid-for smiles. After a moment she takes the wad of cash out of her pocket and begins making stacks of fifties and twenties.

Inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out a 2 foot long oval shaped wooden board, an infant board, and a blanket.

C: RAY
D: Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas.
C: TROOPER NAPOLI
D: I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.
C: RAY
D: Oh my God.
N: He nods his head.
C: TROOPER NAPOLI
D: If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter. You don't want her around young kids.
C: RAY
D: Absolutely.
N: He eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained siding is visible.
C: TROOPER NAPOLI
D: Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday.
C: RAY
D: Thanks. You, too.
N: Ray stands and watches the trooper drive away. She feels in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold. When she turns around she looks at the trailer and notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it.
S: INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY

D: Put it down.
C: T.J.
D: No!
C: RAY
D: Put it down.
C: T.J.
D: Are you gonna shoot me now, too?
C: RAY
D: Put that thing down!
N: He ignites the blow torch to spite her.
C: T.J.
D: Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. Maybe that's why he left.
C: RAY
D: That was an accident.
C: T.J.
D: Some accident you shot him in the foot.
C: RAY
D: He spent the food money on scratch cards, T.J.
C: T.J.
D: So, he'd done it before.
N: He aims it at her. She walks towards him. He increases the flame.
C: RAY
D: Gimme that thing.
N: She tries to grab it out of his hand, but he is too strong.
C: RAY
D: T.J. come on now.
E: CONT'D
C: T.J.
D: You can't have it. It's mine.

D: He was clean for 23 months.
N: They look at one another.
C: RAY
D: I didn't know how else to keep us together. I mean...he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'.
E: CONT'D chokes back tears
N: He cuts off the blow torch.
C: T.J.
D: Yeah, awesome dad. Robs us and takes off a week before Christmas.

D: Maybe we should.
C: BERNIE
D: If we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the Rez.
N: Rosalie and Barbara shoot him an ANGRY STARE. He shrugs.
C: BARBARA
D: We can expel her.
C: BERNIE
D: You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is.
C: ROSALIE
D: She makes the Mohawk people look bad.
C: BERNIE
D: But she has a Mohawk son.
C: ROSALIE
D: She cost us a Mohawk son.
C: BERNIE
D: Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was doin'
C: ROSALIE
D: She'll never be anything but a smuggler.

C: THREE RIVERS
D: Velma, seen any smugglers tonight?
N: Velma says nothing.
C: JIMMY
D: Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before.
C: THREE RIVERS
D: Rosalie is worried people are gonna think the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I got the Troopers on my back. They want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too. Is that true, Jimmy?
N: Jimmy looks away.
C: THREE RIVERS
D: You got white women doing it now? Jesus. Well, if you see any, let me know.
E: CONT'D after a moment
N: Three Rivers leaves.
S: INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Lila and Ray LISTEN from the kitchen. Ray eyes the back door. Ray grabs her jacket off the oven and takes half the cash out of the pocket and hands it to Lila.
C: RAY
D: I gotta go.
N: Lila takes the money. The Chinese girls look on confused. One gets up and grabs her jacket, but Ray motions her back.
C: RAY
D: No. You stay here.
E: CONT'D
N: Ray hurries to the back door, opens it, but Bernie Littlewolf is there. At the sight of him, Ray backs up. He walks in.
C: BERNIE
D: Hi, Lila.
C: LILA
D: Hi Bernie.
C: BERNIE
D: You're in a lot of trouble.
N: Lila looks at him, unfazed.
C: BERNIE
D: The council voted to expel you.
E: CONT'D
C: LILA
D: Expel me?
C: BERNIE
D: For five years. You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind.
C: LILA
D: They can't do that.
C: BERNIE
D: They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay.
C: LILA
D: They've already done that.
C: BERNIE
D: Believe me, it could get even worse.
C: RAY
D: I thought this was all legal on the reservation.
N: Bernie ignores her.
C: RAY
D: Look, I gotta get home.
E: CONT'D to Lila
N: She moves for the door, but Bernie blocks her.
C: BERNIE
D: If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila. The troopers want somebody.
C: RAY
D: But, she's a Mohawk.
C: BERNIE
D: The Chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers.
C: RAY
D: Listen, my kids got no one but me.
C: BERNIE
D: If you leave she won't see her son again.
N: Ray and Bernie stare at each other.
C: LILA
D: Let her go.

N: Ray goes to the door, but turns around...
C: RAY
D: At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know?
S: EXT. RESERVATION WOODS - NIGHT
N: Ray shuts the door behind her and starts toward the river. She turns and runs along the bank...a long way...then slows down. Breathing hard, she stops. Snow melts on her face. A long moment passes. The sound of the river ice pushing against the bank releases a long, deep moan all around her.
S: INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN -NIGHT
N: Lila and Bernie sit on the old sofa by the big oven.
C: LILA
D: He might be better off.
C: BERNIE
D: Jake wouldn't agree with that.
C: LILA
D: It was all for a new crib. I wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go alone. I was too fat to get behind the steering wheel.
E: laughs
C: BERNIE
D: He wanted to keep you and little Jake safe.
N: The back door opens. Ray is there.
C: RAY
D: It's just a few months, right?
N: Bernie and Lila turn around. Ray walks in.
C: RAY
D: I got baby stuff in the shed.
E: CONT'D
N: She takes the folded double-wide contract out of her pocket and holds it out to Lila.
C: RAY
D: Get a good used single wide with insulation. Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. Ricky's allergic to penicillin. And you can't feed `em Pringles all the time. Okay?
E: CONT'D a moment
N: Lila isn't sure.
C: RAY
D: Okay?
E: CONT'D
N: Lila nods her head.
C: RAY
D: But you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don't want him to get scared, you know.
E: CONT'D
N: Ray chokes back her own tears.
C: LILA
D: Okay.
N: Lila takes the contract from Ray.
C: RAY
D: And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean. Go with her. Okay?

S: EXT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT

C: LILA
D: Where's his coat?
E: CONT'D

N: He glances around at them.
C: TROOPER NAPOLI

E: CONT'D
N: Ray looks at the two girls.
C: RAY

C: T.J.
D: -Okay. Bye.
E: CONT'D
N: He hangs up. Little Jake sees Ricky playing with the Hot Wheels Set and reaches to get down. Lila puts him on the floor. He crawls toward the Christmas tree and the Hot Wheels set.

S: EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY
N: Using the blow torch, T.J. works on the smiling duck Kiddie ride. Ricky plays with Little Jake, dressed in a snow suit. Lila comes outside with a plate of peanut butter sandwiches, badly made. T.J. signals Ricky who brings Little Jake over and puts him on the Kiddie ride. Ricky holds him on the seat and T.J. flips a switch. The ride JERKS a few times then starts to move back and fourth. Little Jake smiles. Behind T.J. a Mohawk Tribal Police Cruiser drives up. Billy Two Rivers gets out and walks up to T.J. He speaks sternly to T.J., pointing at the cruiser where an elderly and frail Mohawk women in her eighties, Mrs. ThreeRivers, looks out the window. T.J. walks over to the cruiser. She rolls down the window. He says something to her, looking at the ground as he speaks. Ricky and Lila holding Little Jake look on. Billy Two Rivers drives away. SUDDENLY T.J. and Ricky LOOK UP. A RUMBLE is heard in the distance. From down the road the SEMI is seen APPROACHING... T.J. smiles and Ricky watches not sure whether to believe it or not. He takes T.J.'s hand.
