M: The screen remains dark for a moment.
N: In the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It might be a small contented motor.
T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
N: LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing professionally alone at the end of the street. It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 'Stardust' merrily to herself. CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid. We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman. As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then turns round for a better look. Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the man's. CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still young enough to need two glances at the customers. She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed at.
C: DORA
D: It'll be two quid...
N: Evidently we have two quid. She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, jerks her head towards the right - and sets off. CAMERA TRACKS after her. Overlaid is the sound of the man's footsteps. Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the man who is following her.
S: EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
N: A wider street than the last - but just as empty. Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS at a respectful distance. CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin. CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film. CAMERA PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop. Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.
S: INT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs. CAMERA TRACKS after her. She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - under his breath - does the Man who is following her. A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera. Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.
S: INT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside.
S: INT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, lights the gas fire then turns round. CLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling. And suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound. CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with great curiosity. It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have it. Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face. The sound purrs on.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
N: BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA - and smile at us. We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK AND WHITE. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour.
S: INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: A darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images are in BLACK AND WHITE. We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is breathing quickly. We see Dora's hips waggling their way home. The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen. When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two- toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us. WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then backing away from CAMERA in fear. WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long race. As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across her face - the title: PEEPING TOM Blots out what is happening to her. OTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands pushing something away. Before the DIRECTOR'S CREDIT:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. A PARK - NIGHT
N: It is very dark. CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs. Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S. They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant shaft of light is trained onto them. Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound. CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree. CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor purring... a blinding spotlight. CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is overlaid. The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light. He advances towards the tree.
C: MAN
D: Hey, you peeping...
N: The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps running away Â— and the night is at peace again. And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: LONG SHOT. AMBULANCE - DAY It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house. WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.
S: EXT. STREETS BY DORA'S HOUSE - DAY
N: A crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching them from a corner of the street (ALWAYS THROUGH THE FINDER- MATTE). WE SEE several Policemen holding back the crowd as two Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty stretcher. Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid. WE SEE children staring curiously into the empty ambulance - and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter. CLOSE SHOT of a SMALL MAN looking at us curiously as he approaches (FILLING THE SCREEN WITHIN THE MATTE).
C: SMALL MAN
D: What paper are you from?
N: The finder is lowered. CLOSE SHOT of a Young Man (MARK) sighting a cine-camera. He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his interrogator. He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words.
C: MARK
D: I beg your pardon?
C: SMALL MAN
D: What paper are you from?
N: Mark smiles at him pleasantly.
C: MARK
D: The Observer.
N: The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the stretcher... there is a body on it covered by a sheet. Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them. He photographs the ambulance as it drives off. He photographs the Policemen dispersing the crowd. He photographs his Interrogator, who gladly poses for him. Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls away.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT of Dora, smiling happily. Her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper. Above it is a caption: BRUTALLY MURDERED. CAMERA PULLS BACK - to show sexy magazines alongside the newspaper.
S: EXT. A NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
N: Mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small newsagent's shop. He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines - showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into the shop.
S: INT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
N: A plump, bald-headed Man stares at Mark.
C: MR. PETERS
D: You're late!
C: MARK
D: Sorry, sir.
N: He turns towards a small door at the end of the shop.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Hold on, Mark.
E: quietly
N: Mark turns round. Mr. Peters hesitates, drumming his fingers on the counter. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He starts to drum his fingers on a shelf.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Mark... I've a question for you.
N: He stops drumming his fingers. So, at that moment, does Mark.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Which magazines sell the most copies?
C: MARK
D: Those with girls on the front covers - and no front covers on the girls.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Exactly!... And it's just the same with the work you do for me.
N: Overlaid is the sound of the door opening.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Look busy.
N: Mark busies himself sorting some newspapers. A whole row of Doras smile up at him. CAMERA PANS to doorway of the shop. An ELDERLY GENTLEMAN is standing there.
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: The Times, please.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Certainly, sir.
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: And The Telegraph.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Certainly, sir - anything else?
N: The Elderly Gentleman hesitates - glancing at Mark's back. Then:
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: I... er... have been told by a friend that you... er... have some views for sale?
C: MR. PETERS
D: What sort of views, sir?
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: Well, er...
C: MR. PETERS
D: This sort, sir?
N: From under the counter he produces a thick book. Mark turns round. From his POV WE SEE the Elderly Gentleman open the book. He - er- seems - er - more than a little interested.
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: I, er... how much each?
C: MR. PETERS
D: Five shillings, sir.
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: I'll take this one... and, er... this one... and, er... how much would the lot be?
C: MR. PETERS
D: To you - five pounds, sir...
N: The Elderly Gentleman hesitates. Mr. Peters turns over a page... and the Elderly Gentleman almost turns over with it.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Tell you what, sir. Four pounds ten - and I'll throw in The Times and Telegraph... how's that?
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: Well, er... thank you very much.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Let me wrap it for you, sir.
N: He puts it in a wrapper which says 'Educational Books'.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Shall I put you on our mailing list?
C: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
D: Oh no! But I'll look in again...
C: MR. PETERS
D: By all means, sir.
N: He holds open the door for the Elderly Gentleman, and watches him leave.
C: MR. PETERS
D: He won't be doing the crossword tonight!
N: He turns triumphantly to Mark.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Those pictures he chose... were all yours! This is yours!
E: counting out money from wallet handing notes
N: Mark pockets them without counting them. CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MR. PETERS
D: And this is yours too...
E: in a very different tone
N: He picks up a postcard - holds it towards Mark.
C: MR. PETERS
D: And that's what I want to talk to you about. It's a clever picture - because you're a clever lad... but, Mark... It's all face.
E: pathetically
N: Mark looks at the postcard in silence.
C: MR. PETERS
D: I don't want to hurt your feelings, son - but if people want the Mona Lisa they go to the National Gallery.
C: MARK
D: The Louvre.
C: MR. PETERS
D: Well, wherever they go, they don't come here... so no more of this fancy stuff...
N: He pats Mark's arm.
C: MR. PETERS
D: ... now get upstairs - the girls are waiting... and so is a bonus if you give me what I want.
C: MARK
D: Thank you, sir.
C: MR. PETERS
D: What do you do with all your money?
E: amused
C: MARK
D: Buy cameras.
N: He opens a door at the far end of the room. We catch a glimpse of a winding staircase. He starts to climb it.
S: INT. REAR OF NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
N: At the top of the staircase is a door. Mark and his camera trudge towards it. The door opens suddenly. A vivacious young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round. She has a towel round her shoulders.
C: MILLY
D: Well look who's here! Cecil Beaton!
N: From REVERSE ANGLE WE SEE Mark venture a shy smile at Milly. Milly opens the door impatiently.
C: MILLY
D: Come on, sonny... make us famous.
N: Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back to camera. She is naked except for a shawl draped round her shoulders. Mark enters the room... the door begins to close. CAMERA TRACKS towards the door. On the threshold of the room, a hood is thrown over our faces. THE SCREEN BLACKS OUT. In the darkness WE HEAR Milly's voice.
C: MILLY
D: Did you read about that girl who was murdered last night?
E: O.S.
S: INT. STUDIO ABOVE NEWSAGENT'S - DAY
N: We are with Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera. Through the ground-glass of the camera WE SEE a SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly.
C: MILLY
D: The same thing nearly happened to me!
E: O.S.
N: We hear Lorraine's voice - muffled, and very far away.
C: LORRAINE
D: When?
E: O.S.
C: MILLY
D: Last night! I went out with my boyfriend... We're getting married next month... trouble was my fiance saw us.
E: O.S.
N: The SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly peers anxiously into the camera.
C: MILLY
D: can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
N: The ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down Milly's back. CLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her face and naked shoulders. From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera.
C: MILLY
D: Well, can you?
N: Mark's voice is MUFFLED under the hood.
C: MARK
D: ...think so, Milly.
C: MILLY
D: Then be quick about it, sonny! I'm freezing.
N: CLOSE SHOT of her naked toes. They start to wriggle. CLOSE SHOT of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod of the camera. They start to wriggle. CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. We watch her in profile as she stares out of the window - clutching her shawl. She has outstandingly beautiful features. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is standing by the side of the camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote- control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks back under the hood.
C: MILLY
D: There he goes again! What have you got under there? A girlfriend?
N: We join Mark under the hood. WE SEE a small INVERTED IMAGE of Milly on the ground-glass. Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine caressed by shadows. She is staring into the camera.
C: MILLY
D: I suppose you have a girlfriend?
N: He adjusts the focus. We can see more clearly the contempt on Milly's face.
C: MARK
D: No, Milly.
C: MILLY
D: Hear that, Lorraine? He's available.
N: From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark come round to the front of the camera, and insert a dark slide.
C: MARK
D: Raise your head, please - and look at the sea.
C: MILLY
D: What sea?
E: O.S.
N: Mark presses a rubber bulb - the shutter clicks.
C: MILLY
D: What sea?
N: Mark inserts another dark slide.
C: MARK
D: I just wanted that puzzled look.
C: MILLY
D: Oh, did you? Well if you want it again, I'll think of you!
E: O.S.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK from Milly's viewpoint, WE SEE Mark holding the rubber bulb. cine-camera is on a ledge behind him.
C: MILLY
D: You're a puzzle and a half.
N: Mark presses the rubber bulb - the shutters click.
C: MILLY
D: This is a spare time job for you, isn't it?
C: MARK
D: Yes, Milly.
N: He inserts another slide.
C: MILLY
D: Well, what do you do for a living?
C: MARK
D: Take pictures.
N: He presses the bulb - the shutters click.
C: MILLY
D: This sort?
C: MARK
D: No, Milly.
N: He inserts another slide.
C: MILLY
D: Don't you like this sort?
C: MARK
D: No, Milly.
N: He presses the bulb - the shutters click.
C: MILLY
D: Well what sort do you like?
N: Mark looks at her thoughtfully for a long moment.
C: MARK
D: I may show you - one day.
C: MILLY
D: That'll be a treat, I'm sure.
N: Mark smiles at her shyly.
C: MARK
D: That's all, Milly.
C: MILLY
D: Oh no, sonny! Now take one I can show my mother.
N: Mark inserts another slide.
C: MARK
D: Think of her then.
N: There is a gentle KNOCK at the door, and Mr. Peters enters. He carries a tray of coffee. He keeps his eyes modestly lowered.
C: MR. PETERS
D: On the house.
N: He lays the tray on a table, still keeping his eyes lowered, and goes out.
C: MILLY
D: Some house! Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole!
N: She glances over her shoulder.
C: MILLY
D: It's your turn now, love...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine staring out of the window. She stiffens. Milly's voice is overlaid.
C: MILLY
D: ... it's her first time.
E: O.S. in a whisper
N: Lorraine clutches her shawl tightly.
C: MILLY
D: Come on, love. Don't be shy.
N: Lorraine turns round. The left side of her face is classical in its beauty. She has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the right side. Her eyes are large - and beautiful - and defiant. CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her. CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine.
C: LORRAINE
D: He said... you needn't photograph my face!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: I want to.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. Beautiful in profile.

C: MARK
D: In front of eyes... like...
N: He tries to go on - but words are a foreign language to him.
C: MARK
D: ...eyes... as full of...
N: In a sudden rush:
C: MARK
D: Lorraine - let my camera tell you.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine standing very still Â— looking at him in silence. Milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot. Overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera. CAMERA LINGERS on the dark liquid being poured into a cup.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Whisky being poured into a glass. CAMERA PULLS BACK
S: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING - TOWARDS SUNSET
N: The hand filling the glass is a woman's (MRS. STEPHENS). She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom they are singing:
C: YOUNG PEOPLE
D: Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you,
E: singing
N: CAMERA TRACKS towards them. CLOSE SHOT of TONY HUNTER, a well-built youngster in his middle twenties.
C: TONY
D: Happy birthday... dear Helen
N: He obviously means it.
C: TONY
D: happy birthday to you.
N: CLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'. A sensitive, intelligent, and extremely attractive girl, who Â— as the encircling youngsters now inform us in song - is:
C: YOUNG PEOPLE
D: Twenty-one today, She's twenty-one today, She's got the key of the door, She's never been twenty-one before.
N: CLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs. Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry.
C: MRS. PARTRIDGE
D: You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
N: Mrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up to Helen.
C: TONY
D: May I?
N: Helen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply:
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Look!
N: He is pointing at something out of camera. All heads - except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze. Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed chair. CAMERA PANS to the window. Mark is standing there. CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at Mark. We watch him over her shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it.
C: TONY
D: It's that chap from upstairs.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - EVENING - LOW SUN
N: The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window. From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS BACK with him. We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious street. Mark hurries towards a side entrance.
S: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at the empty window.
C: HELEN
D: I'll ask him in...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Tony - frowning. CAMERA PANS to Mrs. Stephens' glass... the hand which refills it has begun to tremble.
S: INT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The lights are on. WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard. Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.
S: INT. HALL - NIGHT
N: Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party fills the hall. Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:
C: HELEN
D: Excuse me!
E: O.S.
N: Mark hesitates, then turns round. CLOSE SHOT of Helen - smiling at him.
C: HELEN
D: I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs?
N: Mark looks at her as if he does.
C: HELEN
D: ... but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you! So hello!
N: Her directness is natural, consistent and very hard to resist. CLOSE SHOT of Mark - smiling.
C: HELEN
D: I'm Helen Stephens.
N: She glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over his shoulder.
C: HELEN
D: I'm having a party - and the other tenants are there... And a few friends. We'd like you to join us.
C: MARK
D: Mark...
C: HELEN
D: Pardon?
C: MARK
D: I'm Mark...
C: HELEN
D: Hallo, Mark.
N: She holds out her hand... he takes it gently.
C: HELEN
D: Please come in... you'll meet the others who live here, and...
C: MARK
D: Thank you, but... work.
C: HELEN
D: Oh...
N: She glances again at his camera.
C: HELEN
D: Well, I hope to keep it going for hours yet... so when you've finished why not look in?
N: She realizes that this is not the happiest of phrases.
C: HELEN
D: ...Mark?
N: He hesitates. CAMERA PANS to Helen's door. Tony stands there.
C: TONY
D: Darling, your cake - everyone's waiting.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - looking at her.
C: MARK
D: Thank you.
N: He turns away.
C: MARK
D: Happy Birthday.
N: He hurries up the stairs. CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She stares after him for a moment. Then returns thoughtfully to her party.
T: FADE OUT:
N: The screen remains dark for a moment. We are with Mark in a darkened room. He is giving a film show - and we are the screen.
S: INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
N: His cine-projector points straight at us. A flickering light shines in our eyes. We can see him crouching behind the projector. Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp. There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it. CAMERA PANS to the door of the room. It is blacked-out like a photographic dark-room. The knock is repeated. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He switches off the projector instantly. CAMERA PANS to an open cupboard in the corner. CLOSE SHOT of the shelves. They are stacked with spools of film. CAMERA travels slowly over these spools. WE SEE Mark's hand add two more to the collection; his Voice is overlaid.
C: MARK
D: ...minute...
E: O.S.
N: He closes the cupboard door.
S: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mark comes out of the dark-room behind him - the light is kept out by a baffle and a curtain. He has a pleasant, normally untidy bedsitting room. He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries to the door. He opens it - Helen is standing there.
C: HELEN
D: I hope I'm not disturbing you?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - shaking his head, smiling shyly. CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
C: HELEN
D: I knew you wouldn't come down... so I've brought you this.
N: She holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake.
C: MARK
D: Thank you...
N: He takes the plate.
C: MARK
D: ... very much...
C: HELEN
D: I mustn't keep you from your work
N: She turns to go.
C: MARK
D: I'd like to offer you a drink.
N: She turns round.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you, Mark.
C: MARK
D: I haven't one.
C: HELEN
D: I'd adore some water.
N: She smiles.
C: HELEN
D: a hostess can't drink water at her own party, it looks like a hint to the guests.
C: MARK
D: Will you... would you... like to come in?
C: HELEN
D: Yes, Mark...
N: She steps over the threshold. The door closes behind her.
S: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round the room. Mark's voice is overlaid.
C: MARK
D: There's milk... if you'd like some?
E: O.S.
C: HELEN
D: Very much... if you can spare it?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
E: O.S.
N: Helen glances towards the inner room. He holds out a glass of milk to her.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you, Mark...
N: She drinks it with relish. He watches her in silence.
C: HELEN
D: This is a pleasant room... and you've another inside?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: How long have you lived here?
C: MARK
D: All my life.
N: She looks at him in surprise.
C: MARK
D: I was born in this house Oh?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: It's my father's.
C: HELEN
D: Do you mean I've at last found out who our landlord is? Your father?
C: MARK
D: Well - no... he's dead!
N: He hesitates.
C: MARK
D: I'm the landlord.
N: She looks at him in astonishment.
C: HELEN
D: YOU?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
C: MARK
D: I haven't.
C: HELEN
D: I meant...
C: MARK
D: I know.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: It's his house - and I'll never sell it... but I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
N: He looks at her anxiously.
C: MARK
D: ... if I charge too much, tell me and I'll tell the agents.
C: HELEN
D: The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others or you'll have no peace.
C: MARK
D: Peace...?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
C: HELEN
D: Mark, what do you do?
C: MARK
D: Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
E: slowly
C: HELEN
D: On the photographic side, I'll bet.
C: MARK
D: I hope to be a film director... very soon.
C: HELEN
D: How exciting.
C: MARK
D: I have some spare time jobs... as well.
C: HELEN
D: To do with photography?
C: MARK
D: More milk?
C: HELEN
D: No thank you... to do with photography?
C: MARK
D: Yes... to do with photography...
C: HELEN
D: When I came in were you looking at some films?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: Of yours?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: I'd like to see them...
N: He looks at her in silence.
C: HELEN
D: Know I'm being rude... but I really would like to see them... ...it would be a birthday present... from you to me.
E: she smiles.
C: MARK
D: Would it?
C: HELEN
D: Yes, Mark.
C: MARK
D: Oh...
C: HELEN
D: But I suppose you're too busy?
N: She puts down the glass, turns to the door.
C: MARK
D: Will you... would you... like to see them now?
N: She turns round. He is standing by the entrance to the inner room.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you...
C: MARK
D: I'll... go first.
N: He leads the way - she follows. For a moment the screen is in darkness. A dark-room darkness.
S: INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
N: We can HEAR - faintly Â— the dance music from downstairs. There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement. As certain events of possible interest are to take place in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen. The room is the product of three rooms which have been knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting in the light. In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of equipment above the 'dry'. This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning in the ceiling above the benches. The other part of the room has a window at the far end of it. Heavy drapes are putted across it. Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 16mm screen. Two banks of floods and a variety of spots light this part of the room. There is a small control panel on the wall. Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. All of it glistens with the affection of its owner. There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, watching Helen. From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of Helen's hair. SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a loss for words.
C: HELEN
D: This is so... well - so many things... but above all - it's so...
N: She takes a final look round.
C: HELEN
D: ...completely unexpected!
N: She looks at him searchingly.
C: HELEN
D: Is all of it yours?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: I mean... is it designed by you? Furnished by you? Tell me about this room.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: It belonged to my father
C: HELEN
D: What was he?
C: MARK
D: Scientist...
C: HELEN
D: Then this equipment was his?
C: MARK
D: No...
N: He hesitates.
C: MARK
D: Sold his to buy it...
C: HELEN
D: But it seems to be so... technical.
N: She looks at him with renewed interest.
C: HELEN
D: If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - in difficulties.
C: MARK
D: Don't know what to show you?
C: HELEN
D: Well... what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
N: He looks at her thoughtfully.
C: MARK
D: All right!
N: He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door. CLOSE SHOT of the cupboard. WE SEE Mark's hand reach for a spool of film... then hesitate, poised above another spool. CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching with interest. REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mark. He closes the cupboard, and turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand. He walks slowly towards his projector... he seems Â— for the moment Â— to have forgotten she is there. CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching him thread the film into the projector.
C: MARK
D: This is the first... twenty-first birthday present... I'll ever have given.
C: HELEN
D: It's the first I've ever asked for...
N: He places a chair a few feet away from the screen - and, with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it. She sits down. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks at her intently for a moment - then turns off the lights. Over Helen's shoulder We can just make out the empty screen. Mark switches on the projector. CLOSE SHOT of Helen - the light flickering on her face. CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at Helen's face. CLOSE SHOT of Helen. WE SEE her expression of surprise. Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome boy.
C: HELEN
D: Mark, what a beautiful child.
N: The boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows falls to the floor.
C: HELEN
D: Who is he?
C: MARK
D: Me
C: HELEN
D: Of course it is! Then who took this film?
C: MARK
D: My Father.
E: quietly
N: A light - as if from a small torch Â— starts to shine on the child's eyes. He moves restlessly.
C: HELEN
D: What a wonderful idea...
N: The light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right. It is growing brighter.
C: HELEN
D: You'll be able to show it to your own chi...
N: The child wakes up suddenly. He stares at something... then starts to scream.
C: HELEN
D: You must have had a bad dream...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her in silence.
C: HELEN
D: ...but what was that light? ...The camera, I suppose?
N: Mark does not answer. The small screen is filled with the face of the screaming, terrified child. (Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful
T: dissolve:)
N: WE NOW SEE the little boy standing in front of a garden wall. He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but falls over. Helen laughs. Mark watches her in silence. Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall... At last he succeeds.
C: HELEN
D: Whatever are you after?
N: WE SEE the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at something... rapt, motionless. The cine-camera which is taking this picture now tracks rather clumsily towards the wall. HIGH ANGLE SHOT over the wall of what is fascinating young Mark - A man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing. The CINE-CAMERA PANS - again rather clumsily - to young Mark... staring intently.
C: HELEN
D: Naughty boy I hope you were spanked!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen. It suddenly occurs to her.
C: HELEN
D: ... but, Mark... what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
C: MARK
D: Switch off?
C: HELEN
D: No.
N: She stares again at that lonely figure perched on the wall.
C: HELEN
D: No.
N: The small screen begins to dissolve ...so does the large one.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Over Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress. The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with an attractive blonde.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Tony!
N: He turns round.
C: TONY
D: Me, Mrs. Stephens?
N: The head nods. Tony advances reluctantly towards her. REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Over Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once lovely woman. She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur scarcely shows. The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the camera as Tony reaches her.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I want a word with you.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector flickering into them.
C: HELEN
D: I hate people who chatter in films - but there's so much I want to ask.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK
S: INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
N: She is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, watching the small screen intently. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he watches her intently. Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making. The child is again asleep... this time he is being photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE. A beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto the left, then onto the right.
C: HELEN
D: Again?
E: in a whisper
N: Mark looks at her in silence. The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand, then goes out. Helen half turns towards Mark.
C: HELEN
D: Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...
N: Her attention is suddenly riveted on the screen.
C: MARK
D: No, Helen.
E: in a whisper
N: Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's bed... something which stays quite still for a moment, then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small lizard.
C: HELEN
D: Mark, whatever is that?
N: Her voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated - at the screen. WE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera. Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - its body is pointed towards the child's hand. WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto Helen's face. OVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen.
C: HELEN
D: What are you...
C: MARK
D: wanted to photograph you... watching...
C: HELEN
D: No, Mark!
N: The camera purrs on.
C: HELEN
D: No!
N: He switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies away. She turns towards the small screen.
C: HELEN
D: help me to understand this... this nightmare...
N: The small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror... there is no sign of the lizard. A handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues crying - looking up into someone's face. CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen. We hear a man's deep voice overlaid.
C: MAN'S DEEP VOICE
D: That'll do Mark... dry your eyes and stop being silly.
E: O.S.
N: Small Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his eyes... his hands are trembling. The small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve. Helen turns to Mark.
C: HELEN
D: All right... now look... Mark - what was all that about?
N: He looks at her helplessly.
C: HELEN
D: ... that was a lizard, wasn't it? Or a...
C: MARK
D: Liz...
C: HELEN
D: Well how did it get there?... How did it get there Mark?... Was it a pet?
C: MARK
D: Not mine...
C: HELEN
D: Won't you try to explain?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the screen.
C: MARK
D: You'd better go!
C: HELEN
D: I like to understand what I'm shown!
N: She turns to the screen.
C: HELEN
D: What was your father trying to do?... Photographing you at nigh...
N: Her voice trails away.
C: MARK
D: better go...
N: From Helen's POV WE SEE the screen. Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie. He is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp the bedrail tightly. Slowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the bed, staring. His lips begin to quiver. He bends forward over the bed. WE CAN SEE the back of his bowed head.
C: HELEN
D: Mark... what is this?
C: MARK
D: I am saying... goodbye... my mother...
N: We catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of her. CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
C: HELEN
D: He... photographed... that...?
E: in a whisper
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: Yes.
N: Suddenly - and healthily - his temper snaps.
C: MARK
D: ...and this!
N: He pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it will go. The film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a glimpse of a long line of cars.
C: MARK
D: ...her funeral!
N: It speeds by.
C: MARK
D: ...and this!
N: A confused picture of earth and flowers.
C: MARK
D: ...her burial!
N: The briefest glimpse of a little boy with a spade.
C: MARK
D: ...and this!
N: WE SEE a girl in a bikini by sand-dunes. Mark offers no comment.
C: HELEN
D: Mark, who is that?
C: MARK
D: Her successor.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
C: HELEN
D: Suc-?
C: MARK
D: He married her... six weeks after... the previous sequence.
N: He pulls back the lever of his projector... the film returns to its normal speed. WE SEE the same attractive young woman standing in a garden. She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand. Suddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark standing alone.
C: MARK
D: She filmed... what comes now.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching intently. It's out of focus! From Helen's POV WE SEE a tall man in a black coat walking away from camera. He hurries towards small Mark - who watches him anxiously.
C: HELEN
D: Is that your father?
C: MARK
D: The morning that he left for his honeymoon.
N: The back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of small Mark... all we can see is that tall figure looking downwards standing very still. Camera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing.
C: HELEN
D: What is he doing?
C: MARK
D: Giving me a present...
C: HELEN
D: What was it?
N: Mark stares at the blurred screen, perspiration trickling down his forehead.
C: MARK
D: Can't you guess?
N: The small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our camera rushes towards it. WE SEE a CLOSE SHOT of a CLOSE SHOT - and at the moment we see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid... A whisper which echoes round the room.
C: MARK
D: A camera...
E: O.S.
N: We are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's hands. There is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track. CLOSE SHOT of the shelf which encircles Mark's room. We are looking at the very same camera which the small boy is holding. CLOSE SHOT of the camera in small Mark's hands. His father's finger points lo the view-finder. Small Mark stares into it. Small Mark begins to smile. CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching himself being born. CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching Mark.
C: HELEN
D: Switch it off!
N: He continues to stare at the screen.
C: HELEN
D: Switch it off, Mark!
N: She turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch. Small Mark and his father go rapidly backwards. Mark turns off the projector abruptly. The room is in darkness. WE CAN HEAR both of them breathing quickly. The light goes on. Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps his face averted. Helen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room. Mark stares after her.
S: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: She walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost in anger.
C: HELEN
D: So he was a scientist?
N: He keeps his face averted.
C: HELEN
D: What kind of scientist, Mark?
C: MARK
D: Biologist.
C: HELEN
D: What was he trying to do to you?
N: He doesn't answer.
C: HELEN
D: Mark!...
N: He turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness to understand on her face.
C: HELEN
D: What was he trying to do to you?
C: MARK
D: Watch me... grow up...
N: She walks towards him... takes his handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wipes his forehead.
C: MARK
D: He wanted a record of a growing child... complete in every detail - if such a thing were possible - and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me... at all times...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: I never knew... the whole of my childhood... one moment's privacy...
C: HELEN
D: And those lights in your eyes?... and that - thing?
C: MARK
D: He was interested ... in the reactions of the nervous system... to fear... Fear?
C: HELEN
D: Fear?
C: MARK
D: Fear.
N: CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear'. CAMERA PULLS BACK We are looking at the spine of a book on Mark's shelf. The full title reads: The Physiology of Fear by Professor A. N. Lewis. MARK'S VOICE IS OVERLAID:
C: MARK
D: Especially fear in children - and how they react to it.
E: O.S.
N: CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear' on the next book. CAMERA PULLS BACK The full title reads: FEAR AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, PART I. PROFESSOR A. N. LEWIS. There is a row of such books all by Professor Lewis. CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: I think he learned a lot... from me... I'd wake up... screaming... sometimes... and he'd be there... taking notes... and pictures... and I'm sure good came of it... for some people... He was brilliant.
C: HELEN
D: A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed - and good comes of it?
C: MARK
D: I don't know... if he did... but if he did... he'll have learned something of value...
C: HELEN
D: If only about lizards! Mark - it sounds to me as if your father was...
C: MARK
D: He founded clinics.
C: HELEN
D: He sounds completely...
C: MARK
D: He was famous! Professor A. N. Lewis... three clinics.
C: HELEN
D: Why do you still live in his house... and watch his films?
C: MARK
D: They helped make me... what I am.
C: HELEN
D: A photographer? It's no wonder, is it? But you still haven't shown me anything you've photographed!
N: He looks at her in silence.
C: HELEN
D: Will you?
N: There is a knock on the door.
C: MARK
D: One day...
N: He hurries to the door, and opens it. Tony is standing there.
C: TONY
D: Excuse me, but...
N: From Tony's POV WE SEE Helen looking at the door of the dark room.
C: TONY
D: Oh, there you are, Helen.
N: She turns towards him.
C: TONY
D: The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
C: HELEN
D: I'm coming.
N: She turns to Mark.
C: HELEN
D: I wish you'd join us.
N: Mark shakes his head.
C: MARK
D: Thanks... work.
C: HELEN
D: I hope that you...
N: She is suddenly aware of Tony watching her. She glances at the birthday cake on the table.
C: HELEN
D: ... have a sweet tooth!
N: She smiles at him.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you... for my present.
N: She goes into the passage.
C: TONY
D: Good night, old boy.
N: He puts his arm round Helen, and closes the door. Mark stares after them, motionless. The CAMERA LINGERS on the birthday cake. As the light fades, a voice yells: Cut!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FILM STUDIO - DAY
N: HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a set showing part of a large West End store. A blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a crowd of extras surround her. As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the blonde (DIANE ASHLEY) props herself onto her elbow, looking towards the Director. CLOSE SHOT of the Director (ARTHUR BADEN) standing beside the camera.
C: BADEN
D: OK. Print that one!
N: He glances at the CHIEF CAMERAMAN (PHILIP TALE), who nods his head in agreement. CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing at the back of the camera crew. He shakes his head in disagreement. The Chief Cameraman spots Mark's small mutiny and wags his finger at him. As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's finger automatically wags back. CLOSE SHOT of Baden looking at his watch. He sighs, then nods to the Assistant Director who stands beside him.
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: All right, everyone! Back at two!
N: Baden walks out without a word to anyone. A hubbub of chatter breaks out. The unit downs tools and begins to disperse. CLOSE SHOT of one of the extras (VIVIAN) - a small, vivacious, brunette with delicate, attractive features. She edges towards the camera crew. CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her. Over his shoulder WE SEE Vivian glance towards him. He nods almost imperceptibly. Vivian hurries towards the exit. Mark turns to a shelf behind him - picks up his cine-camera and a little full string bag containing his lunch.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. STUDIO GROUNDS - DAY
N: CLOSE SHOT of Vivian munching a sandwich. CAMERA PULLS BACK She is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior set - a Chinese temple or a medieval castle (or a combination of each like a Pinewood drawing-room). Beside her she has a small tape-recorder, or record-player. We hear music - modem rhythms. There are several people strolling about - but no one in the immediate vicinity. No one... except Mark. CLOSE SHOT of Mark - settling down on the other side of the wall (where they can talk without being seen together).
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark?
C: MARK
D: Hallo...
C: VIVIAN
D: Were you spotted?

C: MARK
D: You haven't... said anything... to anyone?
C: VIVIAN
D: Of course not.
C: MARK
D: Good... like some cake?
C: VIVIAN
D: Thank you.
N: We see him break off a piece of birthday cake, and pass it over to her.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark... I want to be quite clear about this...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at his cake.
C: VIVIAN
D: Tonight, when the studio's empty... I'm to come back-and you're going to give me a film test... right?
C: MARK
D: Right.
C: VIVIAN
D: You'll then print the film - so I can show it to my agent and anyone else who matters - right?
C: MARK
D: Right.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark...
N: She hesitates.
C: VIVIAN
D: I've been offered film tests before... but I haven't liked the terms.
C: MARK
D: There aren't any.
C: VIVIAN
D: Then why are you doing this? Risking your job and...
C: MARK
D: Not just for you... Viv... I have an agent too - and I want to show him what I can do... I want to direct...
C: VIVIAN
D: There's someone coming.
E: switching on music again
N: Mark lies motionless behind the wall. A young male EXTRA comes towards Vivian.
C: EXTRA
D: Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't it?
C: VIVIAN
D: Yes.
C: EXTRA
D: Thought I saw you talking to somebody...
C: VIVIAN
D: I was learning my lines.
C: EXTRA
D: Didn't know you had any...
N: He glances at his watch.
C: EXTRA
D: Want a drink? Dutch?
C: VIVIAN
D: Later... perhaps.
C: EXTRA
D: Be seeing you
N: He wanders off.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark...

D: You didn't mind me asking?
E: switching off music again
C: MARK
D: No, more cake?
C: VIVIAN
D: No... you want to direct... more badly than anything don't you?
N: Mark is silent, staring at the sky.
C: VIVIAN
D: Don't you, Mark?
C: MARK
D: I want... to photograph... the impossible...
C: VIVIAN
D: What is impossible?
C: MARK
D: Something... that has never been photographed before.
C: VIVIAN
D: What?
C: MARK
D: You really want to know...?
C: VIVIAN
D: Very much, especially if there's a part for me.
C: MARK
D: I want... to photograph a murder... while it's being committed.
C: VIVIAN
D: No part for me then.
C: MARK
D: But that... isn't enough.
C: VIVIAN
D: Is this a new script?
C: MARK
D: I want... to frighten... someone... to death... and photograph... their expression of fear...
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark! What's this story called?
C: MARK
D: That is something... he never photographed...
C: VIVIAN
D: Who?
N: Mark is silent.
C: VIVIAN
D: Who is he, Mark?
C: MARK
D: Anyone.
C: VIVIAN
D: No one could... they'd be caught!
C: MARK
D: I wouldn't care... if I had my picture.
C: VIVIAN
D: Besides, how would you frighten anyone to death?
C: MARK
D: There's a way.
C: VIVIAN
D: Well, what?
C: MARK
D: There's a way.
C: VIVIAN
D: You'd better not tell me! I'll be scared to death tonight as it is!
N: A hooter.
C: VIVIAN
D: Back on the set - shall I go first?
C: MARK
D: Please.
N: She rises to her feet. From behind the wall comes a gentle whirring purring sound.
C: VIVIAN
D: What are you doing?
C: MARK
D: Getting into practice.
N: She smiles down at him.
C: VIVIAN
D: See you tonight!
C: MARK
D: See you tonight!
N: She walks away. And the gentle purring continues. CAMERA PANS to the sun beating down on the lot.

S: INT. STUDIO - DAY
N: Baden bears down on the Assistant Director.

C: DIANE
D: How are you, Tom? Roger?

N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: Hallo, Miss Ashley.
C: DIANE
D: How are you, Pete...?
E: to a figure high in the scaffolding
C: VOICE
D: Hi, Di!
N: She reaches Baden - and completely ignores him.
C: BADEN
D: Darling, you've only been playing this part for three weeks, so in case you haven't yet had a chance to read the script...
N: She ignores this.
C: BADEN
D: ... may I remind you that you're a girl with an irresistible impulse!
N: She looks at him - then at her hand - and nods.
C: BADEN
D: a kleptomaniac! Who cannot help stealing... Get inside her, Diane!... What - in all the world - do you most want to steal?
C: DIANE
D: The limelight!
N: Baden sighs.
C: BADEN
D: We'll run the scene where you catch sight of the store detective and faint... Where's the girl who plays the bystander?
N: Vivian steps forward.
C: BADEN
D: How are you?
C: VIVIAN
D: Hallo, Diane...
C: 1ST ASSISTANT
D: Positions, everyone!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Vivian taking her position in front of the lift. She glances at her watch. CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing by the side of the studio camera. He glances at his watch. CAMERA TRACKS towards the lift. From Mark's POV WE SEE Diane catch sight of the Store Detective - and crumple in a faint.
C: BADEN
D: Hit that floor with a thud!
N: CLOSE SHOT of door marked: DON JARVIS - MANAGING DIRECTOR.
C: BADEN
D: D.J. insists on realism!
E: O.S.
N: A timid knock is overlaid before we dare enter.
S: INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - AFTERNOON
N: CLOSE SHOT of a pile of scripts on a great man's desk. CAMERA PULLS BACK MR. JARVIS is immersed in reading a script... his eyes race across the page. Over his shoulder WE SEE what he is reading... a sheet of figures attached to the script. At the same time Mr. Jarvis is holding a telephone receiver to his ear - and we hear an enthusiastic VOICE FILTERED THROUGH IT: VOICE (OFF-SCREEN)
C: VOICE
D: ...it's a wonderful subject, D.J.... Paramount wants it, M.G.M. wants it, Columbia wants it.
E: O.S. FILTERED
C: JARVIS
D: But is it commercial?
C: VOICE
D: Danny Angel wants it!
E: O.S. FILTERED
N: Still reading the script, Mr. Jarvis lays the receiver on his desk and picks up another.
C: JARVIS
D: Are those budgets ready? Well bring 'em in.
N: He replaces this receiver and picks up the original. The voice is still talking - something about 'a wonderful part for Kenny or Alec'...
C: VOICE
D: Send me a memo - we'll discuss it next week.
E: O.S. FILTERED
N: He replaces the receiver. MISS SIMPSON enters. She hands him some folders... her smile curtsies. CLOSE SHOT of Mr. Jarvis opening a folder. Over his shoulder WE SEE a page covered with row upon row of figures. The great man's finger skims along the figures like a tailor feeling cloth.
C: JARVIS
D: There's an error! The total should be a hundred and fifty thousand pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence - not thirteen and ninepence... That could mean the difference between profit and loss on a first feature!

N: He glowers at her - but his day is made.

C: 1ST GIRL
D: In what?

S: INT. DRESSING ROOM
N: Music playing. Vivian moves about nervously in front of a mirror in the deserted dressing room. She wears slacks and a shirt. She glances at her watch - her hands are trembling - looks at watch, hears the fireman coming, then switches off the music and hides in the big cupboard -
S: INT. CORRIDOR

She carries her case Over her shoulder WE SEE the studio lot - in a blaze of light we can see a crowd of people hanging about in solar topees and tropical kit. REVERSE SHOT of Vivian watching anxiously. She turns away - and hurries down the corridor.
S: EXT. THE COURTYARD. EARLY EVENING
N: Don Jarvis strides across the courtyard. We can almost hear - and perhaps we do - a cash register ringing up. One of the white-clad figures lounging indolently in the doorway glances round, sees the Inquisition approaching and freezes. His degree of terror might satisfy Mark. The great man strides on.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ENTRANCE TO STAGE E. - EARLY EVENING
N: Vivian pauses in front of the entrance to the set. Above the note is a notice: 'NO ADMITTANCE WHILE RED LIGHT IS ON'. The light is out. Vivian looks round - there is no one in sight. Vivian slips in quietly, and closes the door behind her.
S: INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
N: The set is in darkness. CLOSE SHOT of Vivian looking round.

C: VIVIAN
D: Mark...?
N: She reaches one of the counters - and leans against it, looking around. REVERSE ANGLE shot of Vivian. She is leaning against the counter of the trunk department. Trunks and suitcases at 'greatly reduced prices' are piled behind her. CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. She starts whistling nervously under her breath. Very faintly overlaid is the sound of Mark whistling under his. Vivian stops whistling - and so does Mark. She listens intently for a moment - then peers at her watch. CLOSE SHOT of the watch on Mark's wrist. CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. She shivers suddenly... then looks at her watch again. She hesitates... then turns towards the exit, and starts to edge back. She trips over a cable and almost falls. Suddenly she is bathed in light. She wheels round. One of the big spots is beating down on her.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark...?
N: No sign of him. Overlaid is a gentle purring sound. Where are another light comes on, shining through her hair.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark!
N: The sound of his steps is overlaid.
C: VIVIAN
D: Listen... we must...
N: His footsteps stop... she looks round.

C: MARK
D: The difference is... a perfect film...
N: Over his shoulder WE SEE the studio camera.
C: MARK
D: ... have waited... a long time... for this... and so have you ... no one... must interrupt it.
N: She glances round at the brazenly burning lights; shakes her head despairingly.
C: VIVIAN
D: We'll be caught.
C: MARK
D: What does that matter?
C: VIVIAN
D: Matter!
C: MARK
D: You stand to lose... a job as an extra... I stand to lose... nothing.

C: MARK
D: So perfect... that even he ... ... even he... would say...
E: he hesitates
C: VIVIAN
D: Who Don Jarvis!?
N: He looks at her, then nods.
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh! He'd say: Sign on the dotted line, kiddies! You can use my pen, but bring your own ink! Mark... if you're sure it's worth it?
E: imitating the great man's voice her excitement is growing
C: MARK
D: It's time to find out, Viv...
N: He walks slowly towards the studio camera. She prepares for the test by switching on music and warming up with dance movements.
C: VIVIAN
D: Come on! Get hot!
E: she accents the rhythm
N: Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and swings the camera. We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music continues.
C: MARK
D: You belong there...
N: He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then bends and looks into the finder. There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen goes dark. It remains dark for a moment. Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, we see everything the right way up and in perfect perspective.) Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's delicate features a radiant miniature. The miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues.
C: VIVIAN
D: I do feel alone in front of it... I suppose stars never do?
E: she hesitates
C: MARK
D: They feel alone without it...
E: he looks in the eyepiece
N: Through the film, we can see only her eyes - large and wistful.
C: MARK
D: ... and the great ones... feel alone... all the time...
N: She becomes the uninhibited Vivian again.
C: VIVIAN
D: Then I'm great, boy! What is it you want me to act?
E: she strikes an attitude a, la Rabbins
N: He looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping time to the rhythm again.
C: VIVIAN
D: Being frightened to death?
C: MARK
D: You remembered?
C: VIVIAN
D: Yes - and I'll have a go!
N: We hear his quick breathing.
C: VIVIAN
D: I've been wondering all the afternoon how you'd do it! I'll bet you've thought of a wonderful twist!
E: she does a wonderful twist
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks down - a little sadly - and peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he tracks forward.) Music continues - piano. In the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced prices' Â— on the shelf behind Vivian. From Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera Â— and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed.
C: VIVIAN
D: What are you doing?
C: MARK
D: Building us a set.
N: He reaches for the largest trunk.
C: VIVIAN
D: Why not pull the studio down while you're about it? They can only hang you once.
C: MARK
D: Exactly.
N: He carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays it carefully on the floor. Music continues. Vivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera Â— as if it were a mirror. The rhythm of the music changes.
C: VIVIAN
D: If only Don Jarvis could see me now!
N: She jumps onto the trunk and taps.
C: VIVIAN
D: If only I could see Don Jarvis now!
N: She giggles again.
C: VIVIAN
D: I warn you, Mark - I'm hysterical... I'd rather act dying of laughter, if it's all the same to you...
N: She jumps off the trunk onto the floor. He opens the trunk. she jumps into it. Her laughter echoes round the deserted studio.

N: She restarts music.
S: INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
N: She is watching Mark curiously as he arranges the lighting.
C: MARK
D: Be patient, Viv... it's going to be worth it.
N: CLOSE SHOT of the studio camera. In front of it - fixed on a small hook - is a tape measure. Mark reaches for it... then carefully measures the distance between the trunk and the camera... then he takes apiece of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the floor. The music continues.
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh well! I've stood alone in front of a studio camera! That's more than most have.
C: MARK
D: Ever stood... behind one?
N: He glances at a nearby dial - only a few feet away from the one which is flickering.
C: VIVIAN
D: No.
C: MARK
D: Help yourself.
N: She goes around the camera out of sight - and he is out of hers. He glances into the trunk - it is deep, and very empty.
C: VIVIAN
D: I can see you, Mark... perfectly!
E: accenting the rhythm
C: MARK
D: Good...
C: VIVIAN
D: Yes, sir! I'll bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business! . . .

N: Mark hurries to the side of the studio camera and picks up his cine-camera.
C: VIVIAN
D: I've lost you!
E: O.S.
C: MARK
D: I'll be back.
N: Suddenly Mark's face appears in the finder.
C: VIVIAN
D: Welcome, stranger!
N: We see Mark raise his cine-camera. He seems to be pointing it straight at us. We hear a gentle purring.
C: VIVIAN
D: What are you doing?
C: MARK
D: Photographing you photographing me...
N: High angle shot of Mark standing in front of the studio camera - photographing her photographing him.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark, you're brilliant...
E: in mock awe
N: He walks slowly towards her, holding his cine-camera to his eyes. In the finder of Mark's cine-camera WE SEE Vivian at the studio camera. She comes closer and closer.
C: VIVIAN
D: Lost you again!
C: MARK
D: Never mind.
E: O.S.
N: We see him standing almost on top of her - his cine-camera trained on her.
C: MARK
D: I'm ready now, Viv...
N: She looks up slowly - and a little hesitantly. Music, all drums.
C: MARK
D: Go and stand on that cross, will you?
C: VIVIAN
D: Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.

S: EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING
N: Don Jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot. It is now bustling with activity. A girl comes up to him... She raises her cigarette for a light - and looks into his eyes.

S: INT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

C: VIVIAN
D: Am I supposed to imagine someone is going to put me in there?
N: Mark is watching her over the top of the studio camera.
C: MARK
D: Yes, Viv...
N: He peers into the viewfinder. In the finder we see Vivian looking rather pathetically into camera.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark - I hope I won't let you down... I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me - but... I just don't feel frightened! Wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
C: MARK
D: Later.
E: shaking head
C: VIVIAN
D: Oh all right! I could do anything - I feel so relaxed - and that's due to you... You're so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too... you have it in you, boy!

C: MARK
D: Imagine someone... coming towards you... who's going to kill you - regardless of consequences...
C: VIVIAN
D: A madman?
C: MARK
D: Yes - but he knows it... and you don't... and just to kill you... isn't enough for him.
C: VIVIAN
D: But how would he frighten me to?
N: She stares into focusing screen - intrigued, but not frightened, not even by the silence and shadowy vastness around her.
C: MARK
D: Stay there, Viv... you're... just right.
N: She stands motionless - staring into camera.
S: INT. CORRIDOR IN STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

C: VIVIAN
D: That..?
S: INT. STUDIO E. - EARLY EVENING
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible tripod. Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it. From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike. He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches from her throat.
C: VIVIAN
D: Yes... that would be frightening!
C: MARK
D: But... there's something else...
N: We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.
C: VIVIAN
D: Well? What is it?
N: Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply - she is looking at something out of camera.
C: VIVIAN
D: That...?
E: in a whisper
N: The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores it, staring out of camera. Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face.
C: VIVIAN
D: Mark... take it...
E: in a whisper
N: The fear on her face is rapidly growing...
C: VIVIAN
D: ... away!
N: She tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her.
C: VIVIAN
D: MARK - YOU!
N: It is almost a scream. We can hear Mark breathing quickly. Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her. Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big power switches go out in the roof. The lights go out. There is a scream in the darkness. Then silence. The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of Mrs. Stephens. A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.

D: Haven't met him.

D: You don't like him! Now why not?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Again she hesitates.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I distrust a man who walks quietly.
C: HELEN
D: He's shy!

D: May I?

N: Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf. CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
C: HELEN
D: I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... but, Mark, I very much want to...
N: Her voice trails away. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package.
C: MARK
D: Happy birthday.
C: HELEN
D: Mark! That's very sweet of you - but really.
C: MARK
D: It isn't much... I don't know anything about... presents for twenty-one... but I saw it this morning... so... please.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you...
E: gently
N: She takes the package, and unwraps it. Inside is a slender brooch
C: HELEN
D: It's beautiful...
C: MARK
D: I like the design... More milk?
C: HELEN
D: More?... No, thank you, Mark... and I really appreciate this... I'm going to put it on now.
N: He watches her hold it against her dress.
C: HELEN
D: There?... Or there?...
C: MARK
D: The first place...
C: HELEN
D: I think so too!...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen pinning it on. CLOSE SHOT of Mark touching his lapel. CLOSE SHOT of Helen glancing at her watch. CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing at his. He thinks of the ticking clock in the dark-room. Helen looks up, and sees him.
C: HELEN
D: I am keeping you.
C: MARK
D: No... I promise.
C: HELEN
D: Mark, I'm here for some advice.
C: MARK
D: From me? Please...
N: He looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman of the year (unanimously) - and the two films he directed have both won Oscars (though Don Jarvis understood them). His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile.
C: HELEN
D: ... I work in a public library - in the children's section... I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me...
N: She takes a deep breath.
C: HELEN
D: In my spare time... I write.
C: MARK
D: What's embar...
C: HELEN
D: I write stories for children... but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen... Lewis Carroll...
C: MARK
D: Had any published?
C: HELEN
D: Some short stories.
C: MARK
D: I'd like to read...
C: HELEN
D: I learned today... that my first book... has been accepted! ... For publication in the spring...
C: MARK
D: But that's wonderful... what's it about?
C: HELEN
D: A magic camera - and what it photographs...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: Whatever made you... think of that?
C: HELEN
D: I'll tell you one day - I promise...
C: MARK
D: Well what does it photograph?
C: HELEN
D: I'll tell you that too - but, Mark... this is the problem... The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes - but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings... but I don't agree.
C: MARK
D: No - nothing's impossible.
C: HELEN
D: was hoping you'd say that! There must be photographs - however difficult to take - and I was wondering, Mark - if you'd...
C: MARK
D: Oh yes.
C: HELEN
D: discuss it with me.
C: MARK
D: take them.
C: HELEN
D: Mark - I can't ask you to do that...
N: They have cancelled his Oscar.
C: HELEN
D: I mean... the publisher's mightn't agree.
C: MARK
D: I'd take them... for you.
C: HELEN
D: Yes but... the money.
C: MARK
D: There are some things... which I photograph... for nothing.
C: HELEN
D: I didn't mean to offend you.
C: MARK
D: Offend?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: Helen... if you knew what it meant... for something to happen to me... that I don't have to make happen... it's like... you've given me a twenty-first birthday...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at him...
C: MARK
D: What does your camera photograph?
C: HELEN
D: Mark - I must go... I just wanted to know... if you'd talk it over with me.
C: MARK
D: When please?
C: HELEN
D: That's up to you.
C: MARK
D: Helen ... I don't know much about... dinner out... but would you come with me?
C: HELEN
D: Thank you.
C: MARK
D: Thank you.
C: HELEN
D: When?
C: MARK
D: Oh...
C: HELEN
D: What's the matter?
C: MARK
D: It had better be soon...
C: HELEN
D: Are you going away?
C: MARK
D: Almost for certain! ...
C: HELEN
D: Oh... well you suggest when.
C: MARK
D: Are you free... tomorrow night?
C: HELEN
D: Yes.
C: MARK
D: I hope I am!
C: HELEN
D: I'll understand if you're not.
C: MARK
D: I'll try to be - I'll try my hardest to be.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you for listening... and for my present.
C: MARK
D: and for mine.
N: They look at each other in silence.
C: HELEN
D: Good night, Mark...
E: turning to the door
C: MARK
D: Good night... Helen...
N: He watches her leave, standing very still. Offstage, the time clock explodes. CLOSE SHOT - the excited clock. Mark's hand silences it.
S: INT. DARK-ROOM - GREEN LIGHT
N: Mark opens the developing tank, lifts out the rack of film, drops it into the fixing bath. He switches light from green to red. CLOSE SHOT - green to red dark-room lamp. Mark lifts the rack of glistening film out of the fixing bath and scans the image. CLOSE SHOT - Mark's face and the tell-tale black and white images. CLOSE SHOT - the film. A pile of trunks. In the darkness we hear a man enquire softly:
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Looking for a trunk?
N: CLOSE SHOT of a Tall Man with a severe face. He is standing in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at 'Specially Reduced Prices'. CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY - and WE SEE whom he is addressing. It is Diane. CAMERA PULLS FURTHER BACK and WE SEE that we are in a small theatre watching rushes...
S: INT. THEATRE IN STUDIO - DAY
N: CAMERA PANS across Baden's disgruntled face... the Chief Cameraman's bored face... the Script Girl's puzzled face... to Diane's expression of rapture as she watches herself on the screen.
C: DIANE
D: I'd like to see that one.
E: O.S.
N: From Diane's POV WE WATCH the screen. We see the Tall Man (SHOP ASSISTANT) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the counter. He opens it with a flourish. Vivian passes across the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders off.
C: BADEN
D: No - no - no - we must get some comedy into this...!
N: The Assistant Director nods.
C: BADEN
D: We'll retake it this morning...
N: CAMERA LINGERS for a moment on the screen as Diane (on- screen) smiles at the Assistant.
C: DIANE
D: I'll take it.
E: she pockets a small item
N: The Assistant bows and closes the trunk. We dissolve to the set itself -
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. STUDIO - DAY
N: The Assistant is leaning over the counter, listening intently. Diane stands in front of the counter, receiving the attentions of the Make-up Man. Baden's voice is overlaid:
C: BADEN
D: I want some comedy in this scene...
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK The unit is busy preparing for a retake. The studio camera (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden briefing his artistes. He is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might be indecent exposure.
C: BADEN
D: Instead of taking the first trunk you see, I want you, darling... to ask for a blue trunk - and when he brings it to you, to ask for a red one - and when he brings that, to ask for a white one... And you, Michael... get the trunks one by one - growing more and more fed up - and we'll end on a gag which I'll think of in a minute - all right?
E: turns to the Assistant
C: DIANE
D: I don't feel it!
C: BADEN
D: Don't feel it! Do it!
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: Positions, everyone!
E: hastily
N: Over Mark's shoulder - behind the camera - WE WATCH the Unit taking up positions.
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: Anyone seen Vivian?
C: BADEN
D: Who?
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: The red-headed bystander - Viv.
C: BADEN
D: Never mind - I'm cutting her out of this scene... Let's run it.
E: impatiently
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: Quiet, everyone!
E: shouting
N: From Mark's POV WE WATCH the scene being rehearsed. Diane approaches the trunk counter and the Assistant smiles at her.
C: ASSISTANT
D: Can I interest you in a trunk?
C: DIANE
D: Thank you... I'd like to see that one...
E: pointing
C: ASSISTANT
D: Certainly, madam...
N: He turns away. She pockets a small item from the counter. He heaves a trunk forward.
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: It's beautifully fitted -
E: he opens it
N: She takes a perfunctory glance -
C: DIANE
D: I'd like to see one in red.
C: ASSISTANT
D: Certainly, madam.
N: She pockets another item. He turns and wrestles with another trunk... brings it forward and opens it
C: DIANE
D: ... do you have one in white?
C: ASSISTANT
D: Certainly, madam.
N: Mark walks away quietly from the back of the Camera Crew. He hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine-camera and a lunch basket. He reaches for his camera. Diane's voice is overlaid.
C: DIANE
D: Do you have one in blue?
E: O.S.
C: ASSISTANT
D: Certainly, madam...
E: O.S.
N: Mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera. WE SEE the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half collapse with the weight of it. CLOSE SHOT of Baden - beaming. The Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. He leans over it - exhausted - then starts to open it. Mark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder. As the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes above the rim of the lid... WE HEAR her scream. CLOSE SHOT of Baden - freezing. There is the sound of a body falling to the ground.
C: BADEN
D: The silly bitch! She's fainted in the wrong scene...
T: FADE OUT:
N: In the darkness WE HEAR a telephone ringing... and then another... and then another... then they all merge into one big blast.

D: Mm?
C: SERGEANT MILLER
D: We pass my house when we reach the bypass. Would you mind if I drop off for a minute?

E: without raising his eyes
C: SERGEANT MILLER
D: Yes, Chief!... If the nipper hears where I've been...
C: CHIEF INSPECTOR
D: All right, Dawson - anything to help the Sergeant... ... and it's about time the Sergeant helped me - we're getting nowhere with this.
E: turns to the driver stares down at the folder
N: Over his shoulder WE SEE what he is looking at - it is a photograph of Dora in her furs and finery.
C: SERGEANT
D: What about that man the landlady passed?
C: CHIEF INSPECTOR
D: She couldn't describe him - except to say that he was carrying something that she couldn't see.
C: SERGEANT
D: That's a help.
N: CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector staring at the folder.
C: CHIEF INSPECTOR
D: Sergeant, I've been on the force thirty odd years... and I have never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's... What was it she saw?
E: almost to himself
C: SERGEANT
D: Surely, Chief... a man coming at her - with a sharp weapon.
C: CHIEF INSPECTOR
D: I'm familiar with that kind of terror. This is something new to me... but what?
N: The Sergeant glances at Dora's photograph.
C: CHIEF INSPECTOR
D: ...now take a look at how we found her.
N: He starts to turn the page
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A door with a sign on it: CANTEEN CLOSED TODAY. CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS it.
S: INT. CANTEEN - DAY
N: Mark is sitting by an open window at the far end of the canteen. His cine-camera and lunch basket are by his side. From Mark's POV WE SEE that the unit (with the exception of Diane and Baden) is crowded into the canteen. They have formed themselves into small groups and are talking in whispers. The Assistant Director is standing with his back to the door. A GIRL calls out:
C: GIRL
D: How much longer must we wait in here?
E: O.S.
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: Till the police arrive... D.J.'s orders.
N: Mark glances at a group in the comer. The Trunk Assistant is encircled by eager listeners.
C: ASSISTANT
D: and when she opened that trunk... and I saw what was inside... my dears - I nearly fainted with her - and do you know what horrified me most?
E: he runs a delicate hand across a delicate forehead
C: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
D: D.J. says not to discuss it.
C: ASSISTANT
D: Any more sauce from D.J. and I shall refuse to sign for seven years! My dears... that poor girl's expression.
N: Mark glances out of the window. From his POV WE SEE a police car driving across the courtyard. Mark watches with great interest - then reaches for his cine-camera. He photographs the police, then puts his cine-camera on to the table and sits back... waiting. CAMERA LINGERS for a moment on the folded tripod.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SET - DAY
N: The set is completely deserted. It is lit by a single lamp. A solitary trunk stands on the counter, its lid closed. WE SEE Don Jarvis enter, followed by the two Policemen. Baden and the Publicity man bring up the rear. Don Jarvis points towards the trunks department. The Chief Inspector nods, then he and the Sergeant approach the counter. Carefully the Inspector raises the lid of the trunk - he looks inside. CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector - over the top of the lid. His expression is mainly one of surprise. CLOSE SHOT of the Sergeant staring into the trunk. He is also surprised - but there is nausea in his face. They look up at almost the same moment... their eyes meet.
C: SERGEANT
D: Chief, it's exactly the...
E: in a whisper
C: INSPECTOR
D: I know... ... don't say anything. Well, sir... we shall probably have to interview everyone at the studio, so we'd better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
E: he closes the trunk quickly. Quietly he faces Don Jarvis
C: JARVIS
D: Thank you, Chief Inspector... if you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.

C: JARVIS
D: If I may have your attention, please.
E: O.S.
N: A hand tugs at Mark's elbow. He turns round. The Clapper Boy looks at him waringly. From Mark's POV WE SEE Don Jarvis standing in the doorway - facing a suddenly hushed room. The great man's hands are folded in front of him -
C: JARVIS
D: The police wish to interview each of you individually... after which you will be at liberty to leave.
N: From D.J.'s POV WE SEE the upturned faces - the light from the window falls upon Mark, listening to him with rapt attention. Mark's hands are folded in front of him.
C: JARVIS
D: There will, of course, be no shooting today... but work will be resumed, as usual, tomorrow... with, I hope, all of you present.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis.
C: JARVIS
D: I look to you to give the police your fullest cooperation.
E: he turns abruptly and leaves'
N: Sergeant Miller enters with a smile.
C: SERGEANT MILLER
D: Well now... let's get ourselves organized... We don't want to keep you cooped up in here, so we've worked out a timetable... We'll talk to the artists first, then the technicians in this order...
E: taking a piece of paper from his pocket
N: Mark reaches for his cine-camera...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A SERIES OF BRIEF SHOTS of the unit being interviewed by the police.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
N: The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round carefully, then slips inside.
S: INT. STAGE E. - DAY
N: Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can faintly be heard coming from this set. Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above the Policemen. Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down. Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo round the studio. CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt. Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and nodding. A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.
C: DOCTOR
D: No doubt at all... wounds were caused by the same instrument...
E: O.S.
N: Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the finder over the lid of the trunk.
C: DOCTOR
D: ... both women... subjected to the most violent shock...
E: O.S.
C: INSPECTOR
D: What sort of shock?
E: O.S.
C: DOCTOR
D: ...still cannot determine - but look!
N: He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's eye-line. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. They make three separate landings. CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up. From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...
C: INSPECTOR
D: Quiet, everyone. Please...
N: The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete silence. Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. The Inspector listens intently.
C: DETECTIVE
D: I thought I heard a putty cat!
N: There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.
C: INSPECTOR
D: I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands, and if we don't get him quickly there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the Commissioner. So let's hurry things up, shall we?
C: DETECTIVE
D: Sorry, Chief!
N: The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no one else is. The flashlight dies away.
T: The scene fades with it.
N: CLOSE SHOT of a knitting-needle held upwards. Another knitting-needle scales down it like a fireman descending a ladder. CAMERA PULLS BACK
S: INT. HELEN S SITTING ROOM - DAY
N: Mrs. Stephens is doing her knitting. The inevitable glass stands on the table beside her. Helen is seated opposite, reading from a newspaper.
C: HELEN

N: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening intently.
C: HELEN
D: a spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise, that her role was to have been built up... All work at the studio ceased today as a tribute to her memory!
N: Mrs. Stephens sips from her glass. The Prime Minister to visit Athens.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Mark is in films, isn't he?
C: HELEN
D: Yes, darling... It is reliably...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I wonder if he knew her?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking up.
C: HELEN
D: I'll ask him tonight...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Is he taking you out?
C: HELEN
D: If he's free.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: That's very chivalrous of him. Where's he taking you?
C: HELEN
D: I've no idea - and I don't suppose he has...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Which studio does he work at?
C: HELEN
D: I'll ask him.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: If he's free.
N: Behind her back we see that her fingers are crossed.
C: HELEN
D: I'll bring him in and introduce you if...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I feel I know him.
C: HELEN
D: Now how can you?
N: Mrs. Stephens stiffens suddenly.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: He's here.
N: CLOSE SHOT of the window. Mark is standing outside - looking in.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Why don't we make him a present of the window? He practically lives there!
N: Helen beckons to Mark to come in. We see him nod eagerly - and leave the window.
C: HELEN
D: How did you know where he was standing?
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: The back of my neck told me... the part that I talk out of!
N: Helen hurries to the door of the sitting room.
S: INT. HALL - DAY
N: Mark closes the front door behind him. From his POV WE SEE the door of Helen's sitting room open - and she stands on the threshold.
C: HELEN
D: Hallo...
C: MARK
D: Free?
C: HELEN
D: Yes.
C: MARK
D: Good! So am I...
C: HELEN
D: I'd like you to come in for a moment - and meet my mother.
C: MARK
D: Yes, please...
N: She holds open the door. He goes inside. The screen suddenly greys out into the veiled images of Mrs. Stephens' world. We hear Helen's voice.
C: HELEN
D: Darling, this is Mark... Mark, my mother.
E: O.S.
N: WE HEAR the sound of footsteps shuffling shyly forward - and then Mark's voice, every intake of breath magnified.
C: MARK
D: How do you do... Mrs. Stephens...
E: O.S.
N: WE HEAR the pounding of someone's heart - and then Mrs. Stephens' voice.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Hallo, Mark.
E: O.S.
N: As her voice dies away.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand clasping Mrs. Stephens'. CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her, fascinated. From Mark's POV WE SEE the sightless eyes turned towards his. Mrs. Stephens' other hand gently feels the surface of his.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Have you been running, young man?
C: MARK
D: Yes... ... didn't want to be late for Helen.
E: he hesitates
C: HELEN
D: Thank you, Mark - You deserve a drink for that! What would you like?
C: MARK
D: Nothing - thank you... very much...
N: Mrs. Stephens grunts, and reaches for her glass.
C: HELEN
D: Darling, I've left your supper in the...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Tell me young man... Which studio do you work at?
N: The screen greys out. WE HEAR Mark's tiny intake of breath.
C: MARK
D: Chipperfield Studio . . .
E: O.S.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: And that poor girl... where did she work?
N: Someone's heart is pounding fast.
C: HELEN
D: At Brookwood.
E: O.S.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: We were wondering if you knew her?
C: MARK
D: No - No, I didn't...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: A pity. I do like first-hand information.
N: We hear Mark's small attempt at a laugh.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Oh, well - I mustn't keep you gossiping after you've run all the way from - Where?
N: Again that little intake of breath.
C: MARK
D: The station.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
N: Mrs. Stephens and Mark are staring at each other as if she has sight and he hasn't. From Helen's POV WE CAN SEE only Mark's back and her mother's upturned face.
C: HELEN
D: Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: No... go and be told about yours! Goodbye, Mark... I expect we shall meet again.
E: she takes Mark's hand
C: MARK
D: I hope so - Goodbye...
E: He turns to the door
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen kissing her mother and whispering into her ear.
C: HELEN
D: Darling, we forgot to toss.
N: Mrs. Stephens grunts.
C: HELEN
D: Supper's laid out in the kitchen.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it!
C: HELEN
D: We'll be early! Good night, darling.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Good night...
N: Mark holds the door open for Helen and she goes into the passage. Mark turns and takes a long look at Mrs. Stephens. She is in the middle of raising her glass. She stops suddenly, the glass poised mid-air. He goes out - closing the door. She finishes her drink as if it is her last.
S: INT. PASSAGE - DAY
N: Helen is waiting by the door. From her POV WE SEE Mark coming eagerly towards her, his camera over his shoulder.
C: HELEN
D: Mark...
C: MARK
D: Yes, Helen?
C: HELEN
D: I want to ask you something rather personal...
N: He looks at her anxiously.
C: HELEN
D: How long is it since you've gone out without that?
C: MARK
D: Without what?
C: HELEN
D: Your camera...
C: MARK
D: Oh...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: I... don't think I know?
C: HELEN
D: Exactly. I've never seen you without it... but are you going to need it tonight?
N: He looks at her in silence.
C: HELEN
D: Well are you? And if so... shall I bring some work with me too?
C: MARK
D: I'm not going to need it tonight!
C: HELEN
D: Good - then give it to me!
N: She holds out her hand. He looks at her, appalled.
C: HELEN
D: ...It'll be quite safe - I'll put it away for you.
C: MARK
D: No!
E: in a whisper
C: HELEN
D: Then take it upstairs - if you can't trust me with it...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: I trust you.
C: HELEN
D: Then look...
N: She opens the door of her bedroom - and turns on the light.
C: HELEN
D: ...let's put it in here.
S: INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM
N: She crosses to a cupboard and unlocks it, then turns round. He is standing hesitantly on the threshold.
C: HELEN
D: Come in - and see for yourself.
N: He looks slowly round the room, stares for a moment at the bed in the comer, but he won't cross the threshold. He stays outside.
C: HELEN
D: We'll put it in here - and lock it.
C: MARK
D: This... was my mother's room.
C: HELEN
D: Was it, Mark?...
N: Again he stares at the bed.
C: HELEN
D: I am being tactless, aren't I? ... It's just that... I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and - but you bring it with you if you want to.
N: He takes off his camera - and holds it out to her.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you...
N: She takes it from him, puts it into the cupboard, and locks it. Then offers him the key.
C: MARK
D: You...
C: HELEN
D: Thank you.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: I feel...
C: HELEN
D: Yes?
C: MARK
D: Can't describe it! Could only photograph it -
N: She laughs.
C: HELEN
D: Shall I tell you what I feel?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: Famished!
C: MARK
D: Good!
N: They hurry towards the door.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - DAY
N: They walk down the steps of the house.
C: MARK
D: There's a small place round the corner... It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
C: HELEN
D: Is it?
C: MARK
D: Yes... there aren't too many open then.
C: HELEN
D: No - it sounds fun.
C: MARK
D: This way.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Helen walking along by the side of the house.
C: HELEN
D: I adore new restaurants...
N: Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something off camera. Especially when - Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at something. In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple are kissing. Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries away and Helen stares after him. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He turns back - waiting for Helen. From his POV WE SEE Helen come slowly towards him. She looks at him searchingly for a long moment. He manages - but only just - to meet her eyes.
C: HELEN
D: Where is this restaurant?
C: MARK
D: Round the corner...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Know much about films?
C: HELEN
D: Come on then...
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: MARK
D: Thank you.
N: They walk slowly down the street.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Sorry, young man, Helen's out.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK
S: INT. SITTING ROOM - EVENING
N: Tony is standing unhappily opposite Mrs. Stephens.
C: TONY
D: Oh!
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: With Mark - from upstairs.
C: TONY
D: Oh!
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: You can stay and talk to me - if you like?
C: TONY
D: Well I...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Know much about films?
C: TONY
D: Well...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Or film studios?
C: TONY
D: No, I...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Where's Chipperfield Studios?
C: TONY
D: Chipperfield, I suppose...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: There's a phone book outside... Look up the number, will you? And see if you can get it.
C: TONY
D: Certainly... and then I must go to my room.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Granted.
N: She lifts her glass, and sits, waiting as he crosses the room.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A small and very pleasant restaurant, almost full. Helen and Mark have a corner table. They are dining by candlelight, and there is a bottle of wine in the middle of the table. As CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS them, Helen is laughing.
C: HELEN
D: I like this place! And this dinner!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He has again won the Academy Award.
C: HELEN
D: ...thank you, Mark...
C: MARK
D: Are you ready to talk about your book?
C: HELEN
D: I'm ready to talk about you...
N: His face falls.
C: HELEN
D: It won't take a second - and it's best to have it said.
N: Mark looks.
C: HELEN
D: Carrying a camera is only one of your habits, isn't it, Mark?
N: He looks at her in silence. CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
C: HELEN
D: ... when you stared at that couple, you were like the little boy on that film you showed me... looking over the wall at something he shouldn't see. But Mark - you're strong enough now to lift that child off the wall... aren't you?
N: He hesitates.
C: HELEN
D: ... aren't you?
C: MARK
D: I'll try to be.
C: HELEN
D: Will you, Mark?... Will you really?
C: MARK
D: Yes...
C: HELEN
D: Lecture finished...
N: A pause.
C: MARK
D: When your book's published - will you go on working in a library?
C: HELEN
D: Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a child comes in and asks for it!
C: MARK
D: I'll come in.
C: HELEN
D: I'm not popular with my customers! They ask me for horror comics - and I take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
C: HELEN
D: ... and do you know, Mark, waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books... is as exciting... as a horror comic...
C: MARK
D: What does your magic camera photograph?
C: HELEN
D: People...
C: MARK
D: Yes?...
C: HELEN
D: It's owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown-ups... but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown-ups as they were when they were children... and he isn't frightened any longer.
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark listening, engrossed.
C: HELEN
D: ... and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown-ups than he was - and do you know what he finds?
N: The little boy opposite her shakes his head.
C: HELEN
D: ... that when he looks at grown- ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children! And that means that he's grown up himself...
N: A moment's pause. She drinks her wine - shy, awaiting his reaction.
C: MARK
D: What made you think of this story?
C: HELEN
D: You did!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
C: HELEN
D: ... I looked out of my window - and saw you going off to work carrying that camera like a little boy with a satchel... and an idea came... so thank you...
C: MARK
D: I'd like to think... I was responsible... in some way...
C: HELEN
D: Now what do I do about the photographs?
C: MARK
D: Take 'em!
N: He slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks around... then reaches for his camera.
C: MARK
D: Oh!
N: Helen smiles.
C: MARK
D: There isn't a single face that doesn't look like a child's - not a single one - if you catch it at the right moment.
N: He turns around excitedly and sees her watching him.
C: MARK
D: It would be a challenge!... Unlike anything I've photographed!
C: HELEN
D: What have you photographed, Mark?
C: MARK
D: Everything. But nothing I'd want children to see.
N: She looks at him curiously.
C: MARK
D: But this would belong to them - and they'd know if it wasn't right... Oh, Helen... I would like to find those faces for you... with you...
C: HELEN
D: Very well! Let's try!
N: He laughs excitedly... She looks regretfully at her watch. At once he looks at his.
C: MARK
D: You made a promise to your mother -
C: HELEN
D: Yes, Mark...
E: gently
C: MARK
D: You'd better keep it.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you...
N: He signals to the head waiter... and pays his first bill for two.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT.STREET - NIGHT
N: They walk along the street very close together, but not quite touching. Above them a light is shining on a blind revealing a shadow of a woman undressing. Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly. He stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of him. Suddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at him... they walk on in silence.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HALL OF MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Helen and Mark come in quietly, and close the door. She glances round the dimly lit hall. There is no light under any of the doors, except one at the end of the passage.
C: HELEN
D: Mother must have gone to bed. Mark, it was a wonderful evening...
E: she turns to find him looking at her
C: MARK
D: That's what I was going to say... a wonderful evening...
C: HELEN
D: And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
E: gently
N: A shadow passes over his face.
C: HELEN
D: I'll get it for you.
E: gently
N: He stands motionless as she goes into her room... From his POV WE SEE the half-opened door - and the bed in the comer. CLOSE SHOT of Mark forcing himself to look away. Helen reappears on the threshold - the camera in her hand. He looks down at it - then slowly stretches out his hand.
C: HELEN
D: wonder how this sees grown-ups? ...me, for instance... now that I am one.
E: she turns the camera round she looks at herself in the lens
C: MARK
D: Not you!
E: he takes the camera from her
C: HELEN
D: Mark.
C: MARK
D: It never will... see you!
C: HELEN
D: Why not?
N: He hesitates.
C: MARK
D: Whatever I photograph -
C: HELEN
D: Yes?
C: MARK
D: I always - lose...
C: HELEN
D: I don't understand.
N: The door at the end of the passage opens and Tony emerges in his dressing-gown, carrying a towel. He avoids looking at them - goes into the bathroom opposite, and slams the door.
C: HELEN
D: He'll wake Mother!
N: There is the sound of running water.
C: HELEN
D: ... thank you, again, for my evening. Will you go to bed now - and not stop up watching those films?
E: she is standing very close to him, smiling up into his face
C: MARK
D: Well... I've a little work to do... then I'll go to bed... and think of how to find faces for you...
N: He looks down at the face which he has found for himself. She raises her head slowly.
C: MARK
D: ...faces which - are faces which...
N: She kisses him very gently on the mouth. The bathroom begins to sound like a small waterfall.
C: HELEN
D: Good night, Mark...
N: He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the door. A light goes on beneath the door. He stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera round and points the lens towards his lips. Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs. The waterfall cascades on. The screen grows dark - and the dark-room grows out of it.
S: INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
N: The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into a box. A small motor drives it. CLOSE SHOT of the box. Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image. CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image. Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and hurries out with it. Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen. Behind him something moves in the shadows REVERSE SHOT of Mark. Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching on the screen. HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY - From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow. He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at the shadows at the back of the room. Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector. CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand - switching on the light. Mark turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he can be. CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room. Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare unerringly towards the light switch.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Good evening, Mark...
C: MARK
D: ...how did you?
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: The young man bathing himself brought me to your door... I managed the rest of the adventure alone...
N: He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless. Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares at her. The only movement in the room is her smile.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: This is one room I expected to find locked.
C: MARK
D: I was never allowed a key..., can't get used to them.
N: Mrs. Stephens' sightless eyes stare at him.
C: MARK
D: I brought her home early.
N: CLOSE SHOT of her hand - tightening on the heavy stick.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Thank you...
C: MARK
D: Is there something you...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: ... a talk.
C: MARK
D: Next door would be more...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I'm at home here... I visit this room every night.
C: MARK
D: Visit?
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: The blind always live in the rooms they live under...
N: Mark nods.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Every night you pace for hours above my head! Why?
C: MARK
D: I've no one to talk to... in the rooms I live over...
N: Mrs. Stephens nods. Her hand touches the black cloth loading bag, lying on the table.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I'm told that you stare too much... so do I.
N: CLOSE SHOT of her hand - touching the black cloth bag. CLOSE SHOT of Mark - walking slowly towards her. At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards him. CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on Mark's camera. Mark stares at the stick, fascinated. CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the black cloth bag with her free hand.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Cloth... with something hard inside it...
C: MARK
D: It's a changing bag... we put films in it - so that the light won't spoil them...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: How odd - that the light can spoil anything...
N: The screen greys out. In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Every night you switch on that film machine.
N: We hear his tiny intake of breath.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: What are these films you can't wait to look at?
N: The sound of his footsteps softly approaching. Like a chair?
C: MARK
D: Like a chair?
E: O.S.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: What is the film you're showing now?
E: O.S.
N: Very faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath.
T: FADE IN:
N: The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal. Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick in front of her.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Why don't you lie to me? I'd never know...
C: MARK
D: You'd know at once -
N: Mrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the 16mm screen.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Take me to your cinema.
C: MARK
D: Yes.
N: He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us. Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - her face only inches from the screen - the light from the projector flickering on to her. REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches out her hands and touches the screen.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: What am I seeing, Mark?
N: Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's terrified eyes.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Why don't you answer?
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Mrs. Stephens.
C: MARK
D: It's no good - I was afraid it wouldn't be.
E: staring at the screen
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: What?
C: MARK
D: The lights failed too soon.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: They always do.
E: pause
C: MARK
D: I'll have to try again.
N: He hurries to his cine-camera.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I've yet to meet an artist who could judge his own work...
N: Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: What do you think you've spoiled?
C: MARK
D: An opportunity... now I must find another.
N: He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses another switch, and then another, until the whole of her face is shining with light.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Why are you putting those lights on my face?
N: He walks towards her. She starts to back away. The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod. Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world. WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching... the purring changes direction.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Mark...
E: O.S.
C: MARK
D: It's almost over...
E: O.S.
N: The purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud.
T: FADE IN:
N: Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder.
C: MARK
D: Please let me finish! It's for Helen!
N: She edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it tightly.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: What do you mean? It's for Helen?
C: MARK
D: She wants to see something I've photographed!
N: He returns excitedly to his camera.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs...
N: On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.
C: MARK
D: Please... don't be frightened.
E: O.S.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Not frightened! Hot!
N: But it is fear that we are looking at.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: So put that camera away...
N: On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips nervously.
C: MARK
D: Yes!
N: He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the tripod. He turns away without looking at her - and hurries to the door. CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening to his movements - puzzled.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: In rather a hurry, aren't you?
N: He glances towards her. From his POV WE SEE the fear in her eyes. He looks away at once, staring into the darkened room.
C: MARK
D: It's late.
N: From her POV (shooting over her shoulder with a large CLOSE SHOT of her ear in the foreground) WE SEE Mark standing in the doorway - and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy breathing.
C: MARK
D: You must be tired...
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
N: We hear his quick intake of breath.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: I won't be selfish... You can take some more pictures - if you want to...
C: MARK
D: No... thank you.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Why not, Mark?
E: quietly
C: MARK
D: Run out of film.
C: MRS. STEPHENS
D: Can't you find some - to please Helen?
N: He glances towards her - then hurries into the next room.

D: Inspector, have you convinced yourself he's a member of my unit?
C: INSPECTOR

C: BADEN
D: Waiting for me on the set.

The Inspector then glances towards the Hat Salesman, who is holding court in the comer. We return to Mark and the Doctor.

C: MARK
D: You know what he was interested in before he died?

Like a small girl in front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. A beam of light shoots out. We watch Helen's face as she looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - then something starts to happen to the comers of her mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards the door.

N: He does so - at once. She walks towards him. He turns away from her.
C: HELEN
D: Look at me, Mark!
C: MARK
D: Not if you're frightened...
C: HELEN
D: Look at me!
N: Slowly he faces her.
C: HELEN
D: What did you do... to those girls?
C: MARK
D: No.
C: HELEN
D: What did you do, Mark...?
N: He tries to turn away - but she follows him.
C: HELEN
D: If you want to torment me... for the rest of my life... then make me imagine!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his eyes closed.
C: HELEN
D: What did you do ... to those girls?
C: MARK
D: Can't...
C: HELEN
D: Show me, Mark...
C: MARK
D: But if you're frightened...
C: HELEN
D: Show me - or I'll remain frightened... for the rest of my life. Show me!
N: He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases the tripod. CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.
C: MARK
D: Do you know... what the most frightening thing in the world is?...
E: O.S.
N: She is looking at something, puzzled.
C: MARK
D: It's fear.
N: The sound of his footsteps approaching...
C: MARK
D: So I did something... very simple...
N: WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.
C: MARK
D: Very simple.
N: WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is looking at something else.
C: MARK
D: When they felt the spike... touching their throats... and knew I was going to kill them...
N: The spike is touching her throat.
C: MARK
D: ... I made them - watch their own deaths!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle of her forehead.
C: MARK
D: Made them see their own terror as the spike went in... and if death has a face, they saw that too!
N: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of the camera.
C: MARK
D: Not you! Not you! I'll never photograph you! I promised - I promised - Not you!
N: Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her throat. CLOSE SHOT of Mark Â— his face turned away from the viewfinder.
C: HELEN
D: ... frightened ... for you...
N: There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the other room.
S: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The Police arrive: three cars. Mark appears at an upstairs window with his camera.
C: SERGEANT
D: Look out!
N: He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge for the house. Mark disappears.
S: INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He knows exactly what he has to do.
C: HELEN
D: Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!
C: MARK
D: I've been ready for this... for such a long time...
N: Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards him...
C: HELEN
D: What are you...
C: MARK
D: It'll be all right.
N: He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the Policemen pounding on the door.
C: MARK
D: I can beat that!
N: He crosses to a switch - presses it. The room is filled with a small boy's screaming.
C: HELEN
D: Give yourself up... Mark!
N: He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of the older cameras have flashlights attached.
C: MARK
D: Watch them, Helen... Watch them say goodbye - one by one - I've timed this... so often...
E: he presses a master switch on the wait
N: Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs. Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer Â— are the spikes of the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the approach - and Helen's terrified face.
C: HELEN
D: No - No!
N: The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.
C: MARK
D: I wish... I could have found your faces for you...
N: The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door.
C: MARK
D: Helen - I'm afraid!
N: We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is winking rapidly.
C: MARK
D: I'm glad I'm afraid!
N: Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine- camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of The Magic Camera. The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless at what they see. CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands. The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:
C: FATHER'S VOICE
D: Don't be a silly boy... there's nothing to be afraid of...
E: O.S.
N: And a small voice answers.
C: CHILD'S VOICE
D: Good night, Daddy...
E: O.S.
N: The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the 16mm screen fades slowly into greyness... The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small child.
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
