T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING
N: A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate. A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past, SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all about. Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.
C: LLOYD
D: Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost.
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: Go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge.
E: heavy European accent
N: Lloyd checks out her body.
C: LLOYD
D: I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey?
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: Austria.
E: unimpressed
C: LLOYD
D: Austria? You're kidding. Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie.
E: mock-Australian accent
N: The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.
C: LLOYD
D: Guess I won't be going Down Under tonight...
E: CONT'D to self
N: He SIGHS and zips the window back up.
S: INT. LIMO
N: Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER! The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:
C: DISPATCHER
D: Carr 22, come in, car 22...
E: v.o.
N: Lloyd grabs his CB mike.
C: LLOYD
D: This is 22.
C: DISPATCHER
D: 22, where the hell are you, Lloyd? You're running late on the East Side pick-up.
C: LLOYD
D: Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my way.
C: DISPATCHER
D: Well hurry it up. And make sure you park legally. One more ticket and your ass is history.
E: v.o.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
N: This building is white with black spots on it, like a DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside. The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it. HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm of DOGS pile out.
C: HARRY
D: Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies...
N: The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR. PALMER, sticks his head out.
C: PALMER
D: Hey, why aren't those mutts on leashes?
C: HARRY
D: The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell.
C: PALMER
D: Just get them in here now! They all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour.
N: Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits them on a wall.
C: HARRY
D: You kids stay right here...
N: As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away, taking the two dogs with it.
C: HARRY
D: Hey, wait a minute!
E: CONT'D at truck
N: Harry chases after the vehicle.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY
N: Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the front oor and RINGS THE BELL. The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when he lays eyes on her.
C: MARY
D: Hello. I'll be just a minute...
E: beat
N: As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind his ears...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIMO - DAY
N: Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he is speechless. Then:
C: LLOYD
D: Why you going to the airport? Flying somewhere?
C: MARY
D: How'd you guess?
E: dead-pan
C: LLOYD
D: Well, I saw your luggage, then when I noticed the airline ticket, I put two and two together. So where you heading?
E: beat
C: MARY
D: Aspen.
C: LLOYD
D: Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear California's beautiful this time of year. Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another glance.
C: LLOYD
D: Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.
E: CONT'D
C: MARY
D: I'm Mary.
N: ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate to impress her.
C: LLOYD
D: Uh, this isn't my real job, you know. It's only temporary.
C: MARY
D: Oh?
C: LLOYD
D: Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store.
C: MARY
D: That's nice.
C: LLOYD
D: I got worms.
E: smiling
C: MARY
D: I beg your pardon?
C: LLOYD
D: That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids.
C: MARY
D: Aren't ants quiet, too?
N: Lloyd realizes she has a point.
C: LLOYD
D: Uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back.
C: MARY
D: I see.
C: LLOYD
D: And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean.
N: To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's concerned about something.
C: LLOYD
D: What's the matter? Little tense about the flight?
E: CONT'D
C: MARY
D: Something like that.
E: beat
N: Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.
C: LLOYD
D: It's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like in a head-on crash, or something.
C: MARY
D: Um, Lloyd, could please keep your eyes on the road.
C: LLOYD
D: Good thinking. There's a lot of bad rivers out there.
N: Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
N: Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.
C: MARY
D: Here you go.
C: LLOYD
D: Keep it. It was my pleasure.
N: For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This makes her more lovely than ever.
C: LLOYD
D: Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and pass out. You'll be there before you know it.
E: CONT'D
C: MARY
D: Thanks Lloyd. And good luck with your worms.
E: beat
N: Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal, followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her, ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight. Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo, LOVESICK. For a moment he doesn't even have the energy to turn the key. He just drops his head against the steering wheel, DEVASTATED. There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks up to see a POLICE OFFICER standing there.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Come on, move it, you're in a red zone.
N: Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
N: Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are focused straight ahead. She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.
C: ARMANI SUIT
D: She's gonna leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator. You make the pick-up.
C: PLAID SPORTCOAT
D: Piece of cake.
S: EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
N: As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport window and SEES MARY WALKING ALONG. When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too. She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He turns to see a car irectly behind him.
C: LLOYD
D: Drive around me, you pinhead!
E: to car's driver
N: When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION. He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.
S: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL
N: The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at each other, dumbstruck.
S: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE
N: Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion of numbers.
C: LLOYD
D: Damn!
N: QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.
S: EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
N: Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. HIS POV - his limo is being towed away under the supervision of the Police Officer. He takes off after it, but to no avail.
C: LLOYD
D: You can't do this! I'll lose my job!
N: As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his fingers through his hair.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON
N: We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building. They disappear inside without acknowledging each other. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat. They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE MENTAL).
C: MENTAL
D: Who the hell do you figure this guy's working for?
C: SHAY
D: I don't know, but we'd better find out...
N: Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.
C: SHAY
D: Your ulcer?
E: CONT'D
C: MENTAL
D: It ain't gonna kill me.
S: INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR
N: Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently toward the door of their apartment.
S: INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
N: Lloyd and Harry ENTER and pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still has the briefcase in his lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY, tweets hello, but the two guys just sit there SILENTLY. The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.
C: HARRY
D: I got fired again.
N: Lloyd shakes his head.
C: LLOYD
D: I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense.
C: HARRY
D: None taken. Were you shitcanned, too?
C: LLOYD
D: Of course not. I quit.
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: Why'd you quit?
C: LLOYD
D: I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me.
C: HARRY
D: Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded?
C: LLOYD
D: Winners control their own destiny, Har.
N: Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one to him.
C: HARRY
D: You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. The alarm alone cost me two hundred.
E: beat
C: LLOYD
D: Big deal. That car's an old bomb anyway.
C: HARRY
D: What are you talking about? It's only six years old.
C: LLOYD
D: That's forty-two in dog years.
N: They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry notices the briefcase.
C: HARRY
D: What's with the briefcase?
C: LLOYD
D: It's a love memento.
C: HARRY
D: Huh?
C: LLOYD
D: The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of story.
C: HARRY
D: What's in it?
C: LLOYD
D: DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property?
C: HARRY
D: Why not?
C: LLOYD
D: It's locked.
E: beat
N: They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK. The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to the PEEPHOLE. HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental are standing at the door.
C: LLOYD
D: Friend or foe?
E: CONT'D WHISPERING to Harry
C: HARRY
D: We don't have any friends.
E: WHISPERING
N: Harry is still squinting out the peephole.
C: HARRY
D: Can't recognize them. Could be student loan thugs again, or the IRS, or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced a check on.
E: CONT'D
C: LLOYD
D: Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Praline.
C: HARRY
D: Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing plaid.
C: LLOYD
D: That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment.
E: cringing
N: Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the window and down the fire escape.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON
N: The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out. Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY.
S: INT. STANLEY GRABNER'S OFFICE - UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE -
N: AFTERNOON STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.
C: GRABNER
D: Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that neither I nor the unemployment epartment of the state of Rhose Island can do anything for you. You've run out of chances. You're unemployable. Remember last year? Middle of winter I busted my butt to
E: beat
N: GET YOU BOTH PRIME JOBS. TWELVE- fifty an hour, and you went and blew it!
C: LLOYD
D: Blew it? For your information, we only missed three days in two months.
C: HARRY
D: Yeah, and that was because of a blizzard
C: GRABNER
D: YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS!
E: exploding
N: Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.
C: HARRY
D: Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find something else for us. How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline?
N: Grabner jumps up.
C: GRABNER
D: OUT!!!!!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HARRY & LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
N: J.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom.
C: MENTAL
D: The briefcase ain't here. He must've taken it with him.
C: J.P. SHAY
D: Shit. Well he's gotta come home sometime.
E: beat
N: Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage.
C: MENTAL
D: Maybe we should leave him a little message to let 'em know we're playing hardball.
N: Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around the bird, who SCREECHES IN TERROR.
C: MENTAL
D: I taut I taw a puddy cat.
E: CONT'D a la Tweety Bird
N: Mental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone- chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING.
C: MENTAL
D: I did, I did...
E: CONT'D still Tweety
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building entrance.
C: LLOYD
D: Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities.
N: Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills.
C: LLOYD
D: What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train?
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
N: Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries. He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and removes a quarter. He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper. He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper, and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET STILL INSIDE. Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN struggles by using a WALKER.
C: LLOYD
D: Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar?
C: ELDERLY WOMAN
D: Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't...
C: LLOYD
D: Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine.
C: ELDERLY LADY
D: Of course, young man...
N: Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters. Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER, AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he sees that SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT
N: A thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up the steps to his apartment.
S: INT. LLOYD & HARRY'S APARTMENT
N: The door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the couch, looking almost comatose.
C: HARRY
D: Where's the booze?
C: LLOYD
D: It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too.
N: Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN.
C: LLOYD
D: Come on, man, cheer up. We've been own before. I'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere.
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead.
N: Lloyd looks touched by this.
C: LLOYD
D: Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What happened?
C: HARRY
D: His head fell off.
C: LLOYD
D: His head fell off?
C: HARRY
D: Yeah, he was pretty old.
N: Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately.
C: LLOYD
D: I don't suppose he had a warranty...?
E: hopeful
C: HARRY
D: Nah, I bought him used.
N: As Lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.
C: LLOYD
D: That's it! I've had it with this ump! We don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old
N: LADIES...
C: HARRY
D: Okay, calm down.
C: LLOYD
D: No I won't calm down.
N: Lloyd flops down in a chair.
C: LLOYD
D: What the hell are we doing here anyway, Harry? We've got to get out of this town.
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: Yeah, and go where?
C: LLOYD
D: I'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talking about Aspen.
E: dramatic PAUSE
C: HARRY
D: Aspen?
C: LLOYD
D: That's right, Aspen.
C: HARRY
D: I don't know, Lloyd, the French are assholes.
C: LLOYD
D: Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Or do you want to enjoy your life? Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain. Don't you see what he was saying? Spread your wings, man. he was saying? Spread your wings, man. Fly.
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: What are you talking about, Lloyd? His head fell off. Wait a second, I know what you're up to. You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there.
E: confused dawning realization
C: LLOYD
D: That's bullshit. I'll drive. And what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline?
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. I'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors.
E: torn
N: Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry cityscape.
C: LLOYD
D: You know what I'm sick and tired of, Harry? I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody.
E: MORE
C: LLOYD
D: But most of all, I'm sick and tired of having nobody.
E: CONT'D beat
N: There's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.
C: HARRY
D: Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.
C: LLOYD
D: On the other hand, maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. With all those lawsuits against us, I'm sure we'll win at least one. It could be a boost to our egos.
N: Harry sees that Lloyd has a point. He stands and approaches Petey's cage. His eyes fill with tears.
C: HARRY
D: Petey, I made a promise to you once, man... ...and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was.
E: emotional thinking hard
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: The Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny Wilson's "Mary's Prayer" plays on the soundtrack. The van drives past and we HOLD ON a sign that reads: "YOU ARE LEAVING PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND. COME BACK SOON." VARIOUS OTHER AERIAL SHOTS of the car travelling down the road while the song continues to play.
S: INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY
N: Harry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat. The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is BLASTING on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG: LLOYD & HARRY "We've got to get out of this place, If it's the last thing we ever do, We've got to get out of this place, Girl, there's a better life, for me and you..." Lloyd turns down the radio.
C: LLOYD
D: Well, we're finally doing it. Do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together.
C: HARRY
D: Been run out of town?
C: LLOYD
D: Taken a trip.
N: Harry reaches over and UNDOES HIS SEATBELT. Lloyd watches, curious.
C: LLOYD
D: Why'd you do that?
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: What?
C: LLOYD
D: Take your seatbelt off.
C: HARRY
D: Because we just cleared the danger zone.
C: LLOYD
D: Huh?
C: HARRY
D: Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles.
N: LLOYD THINKS ABOUT THIS. THEN:
C: LLOYD
D: Well what about the people who live around here? What if we got into an accident with one of them?
N: Harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio.
C: HARRY
D: Where'd you get those?
C: LLOYD
D: Bought 'em when we filled up.
C: HARRY
D: Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember?
C: LLOYD
D: This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style.
C: HARRY
D: Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks?
C: LLOYD
D: I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.
C: HARRY
D: You mean the blind kid?
C: LLOYD
D: That's right.
N: Lloyd looks out the window guiltily.
C: HARRY
D: What did you sell him, Lloyd?
C: LLOYD
D: Just some odds and ends.
C: HARRY
D: Specifically?
C: LLOYD
D: Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to?
C: HARRY
D: But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head.
C: LLOYD
D: Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the ead bird up, but it flops into his lap.
C: BILLY
D: Fly!
N: Joe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps.
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON A NOTE - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door. It reads: TO ALL OUR LOVED ONES - PACKED UP AND DROVE TO ASPEN - HAVE A NICE LIFE - LLOYD AND HARRY. PULLBACK to reveal Joe Mental and J.P. Shay.
C: MENTAL
D: Those bastards. They're rubbing it right in our faces.
C: J.P. SHAY
D: Shit! Andre will have a goddamn aneurysm if we don't get that briefcase back.
C: MENTAL
D: Don't worry, we'll get it back. And I'll tell you something else. They ain't gonna reach Aspen, either. I'll make sure of that.
N: Mental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on them.
S: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: A pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs. Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the air.
C: BILLY
D: Come on, boy, fly!
N: Plop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS OUT:
C: BILLY
D: Excuse me, mister. Is there something wrong with my bird?
E: CONT'D
N: Mental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can.
C: MENTAL
D: Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew south for the winter.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON
N: Harry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out before him.
C: HARRY
D: How far have we gone?
C: LLOYD
D: According to this map, about an inch and a half.
C: HARRY
D: Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money.
C: LLOYD
D: Relax. We have more than enough.
C: HARRY
D: I believe you're wrong, Lloyd.
C: LLOYD
D: And I believe I'm right, Harry.
C: HARRY
D: I still say wrong, Lloyd.
C: LLOYD
D: How much you wanna bet?
C: HARRY
D: I don't bet.
N: Lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous.
C: LLOYD
D: What do you mean you don't bet?
C: HARRY
D: I mean I don't gamble, you know that. Never have and never will.
C: LLOYD
D: Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day's out.
C: HARRY
D: There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do it.
C: LLOYD
D: I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose.
C: HARRY
D: You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I already told you, I don't gamble.
C: LLOYD
D: Okay, five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day's out.
C: HARRY
D: Sorry, pal, no way.
C: LLOYD
D: Make it ten-to-one. Harry sticks out his hand.
C: HARRY
D: You got yourself a bet, sucker!
N: As Harry SHAKES LLOYD'S HAND, Lloyd breaks into a BIG SMILE. Harry immediately realizes he's been had.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ - AFTERNOON
N: The Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor- trailer trucks.
S: INT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ
N: Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables of tough-looking TRUCKERS. Harry oesn't look happy. A middle- aged, no-nonsense WAITRESS approaches their table with a couple of burgers and drinks. She puts them down in front of the boys and starts to walk away.
C: LLOYD
E: to Waitress
N: UH, EXCUSE ME... The Waitress reluctantly returns to the table.
C: LLOYD
D: What's the soup du jour?
E: CONT'D
C: WAITRESS
D: It's the soup-of-the-day.
C: LLOYD
D: Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.
C: WAITRESS
D: Anything else before I leave the area?
E: sarcastic
C: HARRY
D: Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon?
N: The Waitress SIGHS and picks up the milk. Then she BLOWS
C: INTO THE STRAW, MIXING
D: THE DRINK.
C: WAITRESS
D: There. Now you don't need one.
N: The guys watch her stomp away. LLOYD FEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID- back country-folk, don't it, Harry? Harry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put it in the ashtray, he accidentally KNOCKS OVER THE SALT SHAKER.
C: LLOYD
D: Uh-oh...
C: HARRY
D: What's the matter?
C: LLOYD
D: You spilled the salt. That's bad luck. We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder.
C: HARRY
D: What for?
C: LLOYD
D: Because that's good luck.
N: Harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it over his shoulder. Suddenly they hear a YELP.
C: MALE VOICE
D: What the fuck?!
E: o.s.
C: LLOYD
D: Or was it the left shoulder?
N: They turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his eyes.
C: TRUCKER
D: Who's the dead man threw shit in my eye?
N: The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM, SIXTY-NINE 'EM.
C: HARRY
D: It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology.
N: The Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his equally burly FRIENDS. BURLY FRIEND #1 Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass! Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger.
C: SEA BASS
D: You gonna eat that?
C: HARRY
D: Um... the thought had crossed my mind.
N: At this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF TOBACCO SPIT ONTO THE HAMBURGER.
C: SEA BASS
D: Still want it?
N: Harry stares at the burger non-commitally.
C: HARRY
D: Nah, you go ahead.
N: Sea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to the LAUGHTER of his friends.

N: The Waitress drops the check on Lloyd and Harry's table and STOMPS away. Harry studies the bill and SIGHS.
C: HARRY
D: Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten.
C: LLOYD
D: Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me...
E: brightening
N: Lloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A nervous Harry trails after him.
C: LLOYD
D: Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier.
E: CONT'D
C: SEA BASS
D: Huh?
C: LLOYD
D: What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet.
N: Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the Truckers seem to like the idea.
C: SEA BASS
D: Make it four boiler-makers.
C: LLOYD
D: Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road.
N: Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER.
C: HARRY
D: Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks.
N: Lloyd hands the Cashier their check.
C: LLOYD
D: Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab.
C: CASHIER
D: Sea Bass said that?
E: skeptical
C: LLOYD
D: Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass...
N: He points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced.
C: CASHIER
D: Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants...
N: Harry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter.
C: HARRY
D: Oh, and put these on there, too.
C: CASHIER
D: You got it.
C: LLOYD
D: By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here?
E: to Cashier

C: SEA BASS
D: I'm gonna kill those sons-of-bitches!
C: CASHIER
D: Hurry and you'll catch 'em. They was on their way to Rhode Island.

N: The Mutt Cutts van breezes by.
S: INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON
N: A jubilant Harry's driving and chewing on a mouthful of Beef Jerky.
C: LLOYD
D: I just wish we could've seen Sea Bass's face when he got the bill.
C: HARRY
D: I hope we never have to.
C: LLOYD
D: Don't worry. That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by now.
C: HARRY
D: I hope so.
N: Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously.
C: LLOYD
D: Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a whiz.
C: HARRY
D: Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now. What if they figure out we went the other way. They'll be on us in no time.
C: LLOYD
D: But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do?
C: HARRY
D: Hold it.
C: LLOYD
D: I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.
C: HARRY
D: Well... just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle. There's a couple on the floor in the back seat.
C: LLOYD
D: Are you serious?
C: HARRY
D: Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping now. We could get killed. Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND. Then:
C: LLOYD
D: Uh-oh...
C: HARRY
D: What's the matter?
C: LLOYD
D: The bottle's almost full and I'm still going.
C: HARRY
D: Well stop going.
C: LLOYD
D: I can't stop once I already started, you know that. Quick, get me another bottle.
N: Harry can BARELY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL as he reaches way in the back seat for an empty.
C: LLOYD
D: Jesus, be careful! You almost went off the road.
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best I can.
N: He hands Lloyd another empty and Lloyd quickly makes the switch.
C: LLOYD
D: Here, hold this.
N: Before Harry knows it he's holding the full BOTTLE OF URINE.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - LATE DAY
N: As the Mutt Cutts van travels down the highway, it passes a STATE TROOPER on a motorcycle hidden in the bushes. The Trooper takes off after them.
S: INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN
N: Harry is doing his best to steer while now holding FIVE FULL BOTTLES AND Lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat.
C: HARRY
D: What are you, a goddamn camel?
C: LLOYD
D: Hey, I haven't gone all day.
N: Just then they hear a LOUDSPEAKER:
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Pull over!
E: o.s.
N: They turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT:
C: HARRY
D: Huh?
C: STATE TROOPER
D: PULL OVER!
N: Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at the Trooper.
C: HARRY
D: No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for noticing!
E: calling out
N: He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled Lloyd.
C: HARRY
D: Jesus, what is this, the fashion police?
E: CONT'D
N: The Cop turns on his SIREN.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: PULL YOUR CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE

C: STATE TROOPER
D: You know, you fellas were all over the road back there.

C: STATE TROOPER
D: Uh-huh. Have you boys been doing a little rinking maybe?
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: No, sir.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Then what's that?
N: He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat between them.
C: HARRY
D: Oh, that's nothing, sir.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Do you know it's against the law to rive with an open alcohol container in this state?
C: LLOYD
D: But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer.
N: The officer smirks.
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Is that right?
N: The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He inspects the beer label, then MOVES THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.
C: HARRY
D: Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you.
C: LLOYD
D: YOU WOULD, TOO...
E: under breath
N: Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then:
C: STATE TROOPER
D: Get the hell out of here.
E: pained

S: INT. MUTT CUTT VAN - NIGHT
N: Lloyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger seat. The song, "Cut Flowers" by The Smithereens, starts to play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: LLOYD'S FANTASY: Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow... Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her, she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances over her shoulder at him. CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY BATHROOM. The shower is running and we see the silhouette of two people behind the curtain.
C: LLOYD
E: v.o.
N: OOH... OOH... MARY...
C: MARY
D: How does that feel, Lloyd?
E: v.o.
C: LLOYD
E: v.o.
N: MMMM... TINGLY...
S: INT. SHOWER
N: CLOSE ON LLOYD - we see he's taking the TEGRIN CHALLENGE, with different shampoos on either side of his head and a noticeable part down the middle.
C: MARY
D: How's the other side?
E: o.s.
C: LLOYD
D: Nothing. Nothing at all.
C: MARY
D: Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...?
E: o.s.
N: ON MARY - her hair is slicked back, making her look better than ever. As the CAMERA PANS DOWN toward her breasts, we are surprised to see not breasts but a SET OF HEADLIGHTS SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER CHEST AREA. The headlights FLASH ONCE. Then TWICE. ON LLOYD - he blinks, confused at what's happening. JUMP CUT TO - an eighteen-wheeler is ROARING RIGHT TOWARD THE MUTT CUTTS VAN on the highway. Lloyd quickly veers back into his lane and avoids tragedy by a whisker. A shaken Lloyd lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF, and we

E: v.o.
S: INT. BATHROOM - SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL
N: Lloyd and Harry are sitting in a large, HEART-SHAPED JACUZZI. Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer as the water swirls around them.
C: LLOYD
D: Yep, this sure is the life. Cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets... You know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better.
C: HARRY
D: What's that?
C: LLOYD
D: If you had a nice set of knockers.
C: HARRY
D: That's two things, Lloyd.
C: LLOYD
D: Right now I'd settle for one.
N: Lloyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and looks around at the romantic decor.
C: HARRY
D: I don't know, Lloyd, these places just don't do it for me. Brings back too many memories.
C: LLOYD
D: What happened, Harry? Some little filly break your heart?
C: HARRY
D: Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher. We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.
C: LLOYD
D: Felcher? You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company?
N: Harry nods.
C: HARRY
D: The same. We had this incredibly romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd be together forever. Then about a week later, right out of the blue, she sends me a John Deere letter.
E: SIGHS
C: LLOYD
D: That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?
C: HARRY
D: I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that. I wasn't really paying attention.
N: Harry reaches for a beer and busts it open. He takes a big gulp.
C: HARRY
D: Thing that really hurts is I think she was seeing another guy. Never id find out who.
E: CONT'D
N: ON LLOYD - he does his best to hide his GUILT.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL - NIGHT
N: We see that the black Cadillac is parked a few cars over from the Mutt Cutts van with J.P. Shay in the passenger seat. PAN OVER to a payphone. Inside is Joe Mental. Outside the booth, an ANXIOUS MAN impatiently paces back and forth as he waits for the phone.
C: MENTAL
D: The boys are holed-up in a little love nest for the night. I think they're a couple of fucking weirdos.
E: into phone
S: INT. NICHOLAS ANDRE'S STUDY - NIGHT
N: NICHOLAS ANDRE is pacing around the room with a cordless phone. He's in his late 30s, wears a ponytail, and dresses in Aspen/Rodeo Drive chic.
C: ANDRE
D: What in hell are those guys up to? Is it possible that they're Feds? INTERCUT CONVERSATION
C: MENTAL
D: Unlikely from what I've seen.
N: The ANXIOUS MAN taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental to hang up.
C: ANDRE
D: I don't like this one goddamn bit, Mental. You and Shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit. Now I don't know what the hell's going on.
N: Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip. The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again.
C: MENTAL
D: Hold on a second, Mr. Andre...
N: Mental puts the phone down and motions the Anxious Man closer to the booth. The Man moves forward a few inches. Mental motions him even closer. When he's about a foot away, Mental punches his hand through the glass of the booth and knocks the Anxious Man out cold. Then Mental picks up the phone again.
C: MENTAL
D: Sorry, boss. You were saying...?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDRE
D: Look, Mental, just find out what they're up to. I want to know who these guys are.
C: MENTAL
D: Don't worry. I'm on it.
N: Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van. He's joined by J.P. Shay. As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing.
C: SHAY
D: What the fuck...?
N: Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING. Mental jumps back and pulls his gun.
C: MENTAL
D: Where's the goddamn dog?
N: Shay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now, forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene.

C: MARY
D: It just doesn't make any sense. I left the money exactly where they instructed me to.
C: HELEN
D: Actually, it makes a great deal of sense, Mary. We should have called in the authorities the moment we knew Melvin had been kidnapped.
C: KARL
D: Now, Helen, we've been through this already for Christ's sake, Karl, these bastards will extort us into bankruptcy if we let them.
C: MARY
D: But I'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin.
C: KARL
D: Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen. She's been through quite enough already.
C: MARY
D: It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all a little on edge.
N: Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn.
C: ANDRE
D: Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?
C: KARL
D: Nothing yet, Nicholas.
N: Andre looks upset.
C: ANDRE
D: Perhaps I should call off the Preservation benefit this weekend.
N: IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO RE- schedule.
C: HELEN
D: No, Nicholas, it's imperative that we carry on as usual.
N: The atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter.
C: KARL
D: Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do everything they ask. Nothing's going to happen to Melvin, I promise you.

C: HARRY
D: I think this guy's in trouble. Why on't you pull over.

D: Fine with me.
N: Harry turns to Joe Mental.
C: HARRY
D: Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?
N: Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though, Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS.

C: LLOYD
D: Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet, aged to perfection will rip no fart before it's time. Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's rules: you got ten seconds. All right. I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog extra onions, garden salad with blue...

S: EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO CAFÉ - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A large neon road sign beside the café shows a man's exasperated face with FLAMES SHOOTING FROM HIS NOSE, MOUTH AND EARS. The sign advertises: HOTTEST CHILI PEPPERS NORTH OF THE BORDER.
S: INT. DANTE'S INFERNO
N: Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a table with a hateful Joe Mental. The boys are each holding up a POINTED RED CHILI PEPPER.
C: HARRY
D: I'll do one if you will.
C: LLOYD
D: Okay, you go first.
C: HARRY
D: No, you go first.
C: LLOYD
D: No, you go first.
C: MENTAL
D: Why don't you both stop being a couple of pussies and go at the same time. It ain't that hot.
N: Lloyd and Harry exchange a look, then simultaneously BITE INTO THE PEPPERS.
C: LLOYD
D: Hmmm, not bad...
C: HARRY
D: Yeah, more tingly than hot.
N: Suddenly the boys' EYES LIGHT UP. THEY LET OUT A SHRIEK. A smile begins to curl on Mental's lips. He pours them a couple glasses of water from a pitcher.
C: MENTAL
D: Have some water. It'll help.
N: Lloyd and Harry who are both sweating profusely now start to GULP down their water. This, of course, makes it burn more.
C: MENTAL
D: Aw, shucks, that's right. Water just makes it worse...
E: CONT'D
N: The boys run to the bar and DUMP PITCHERS OF WATER ON THEIR HEADS, much to the elight of a CHUCKLING Joe Mental.

S: EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY
N: Mental is on the phone outside the front door TALKING to Nicholas Andre.
T: INTERCUT CONVERSATION
C: MENTAL
D: It's Mental. I'm just sitting down to a nice meal with our boys.
C: ANDRE
D: Good work. What did you find out so far?
C: MENTAL
D: Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em own for information at lunch. Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.
E: beat
C: ANDRE
D: Well eat fast, time's running out.
N: And whatever you do, don't let them get any closer. I don't need them here running around Aspen. Mental pulls a BLACK VIAL OF PILLS out of his jacket.
C: MENTAL
D: Relax, they ain't gonna be running around anywhere after I dump a little cyanide in their pops.
S: INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY
N: Back at the table, the boys are soaked and HUFFING as if they just finished the Boston Marathon. The burgers have been served, but Lloyd and Harry are still too traumatized to touch them.
C: HARRY
D: That really wasn't very polite of him, was it? Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair.
C: LLOYD
D: Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you. Perhaps it's about time you brushed
N: UP ON A LITTLE TOME THAT WE GOD- fearing adults call the Bible. It's crammed with all kinds of pithy rules to live your life by.
C: HARRY
D: You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'
E: humbled
C: LLOYD
D: No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones.
N: Harry passes the jar and the two of them LOAD JOE MENTAL'S BURGER WITH CHILI PEPPERS, EXPERTLY CAMOUFLAGING THEM WITH LETTUCE.
C: HARRY
D: Here he comes.
E: whispering
N: Lloyd and Harry bite into their food as Joe Mental sits back down at the table.
C: MENTAL
D: Feeling any better, boys?
N: As he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each other and TITTER. Then he picks it up and brings it to his mouth. Just before biting into it, though, he PAUSES.
C: MENTAL
D: So tell me, why you fellas headed to Aspen? Vacation?
E: CONT'D
C: LLOYD
D: More like re-location.
N: Mental starts toward the burger but stops again.
C: MENTAL
D: Doesn't look like you packed much. All I saw was a couple bags... and that briefcase.
C: HARRY
D: The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady just left it at the airport. We're bringing it back to her.
N: This is news to Mental.
C: MENTAL
D: You mean you don't even know her?
C: LLOYD
D: Not really. I was just her limo river.
N: Mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're serious. Then he BREAKS OUT LAUGHING.
C: MENTAL
D: Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time...
N: Lloyd and Harry share a confused look. Mental shakes his head and BITES INTO HIS BURGER, CHEWING HEARTILY. Almost immediately, his happy demeanor is replaced by a LOOK OF HORROR. His FACE TURNS RED, HE GRABS HIS STOMACH AND FALLS TO THE GROUND, GASPING. The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help him.
C: HARRY
D: Hey, you okay, man? It was just a goof.
C: MENTAL
D: My ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...
E: STRAINED WHISPER
N: Harry checks Mental's coat pocket for his antacid pills but unwittingly brings out the BLACK OF CYANIDE PILLS. He shakes some pills out and hands them to Mental, who tosses them in his mouth and starts to MUNCH on them. For a moment, he appears to improve. His BREATHING SLOWS and he sits up. Then his EYES LIGHT UP. MENTAL'S POV - QUICK ZOOM IN on the black bottle Harry is holding!

C: HARRY
D: But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words.
C: LLOYD
D: If you don't count that gurgling sound.
N: Harry lets out a GROAN.
C: LLOYD
D: Hey, relax, man, I'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me, I on't feel guilty at all.
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids. Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a ead guy pissed at me. His restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years.

D: ...My official conclusion is that the eceased expired from oxygen eprivation caused by the presence of cyanide in the bloodstream.
C: DT. DALE

C: DOCTOR
D: Unquestionably. We found these by the body.
N: He holds up the container of cyanide pills. Dt. Dale nods and approaches another COP in the b.g.
C: COP
D: Waitress says he was with a couple of younger guys. They're the ones who called the ambulance then they hit the road.
C: DT. DALE
D: Any idea where they were going?

D: Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold out. Seems we misjudged our expense allocation. If we pay for a motel we won't have enough for gas.
C: HARRY
D: What happened to the dough?
C: LLOYD
D: We over-leveraged.

N: Lloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd Rundgren's "Too Far Gone" begins to play while Harry peers at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we see a series of quick shots: A new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep with his feet now on Harry's lap. Another sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window and his head is on Harry's lap. The next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out. Finally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD,
S: GAS NEXT EXIT. EXT. TRUCK STOP - 2:10 IN THE MORNING
N: The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background are several tractor-trailer rigs and a café. Harry climbs out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the passenger door. Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him with his foot.
C: HARRY
D: Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.
N: Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.
S: EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
N: Harry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up.
S: EXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Lloyd comes around the corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room. When he gets it to the door, he struggles to lift the engine on it's side, finally managing to slip the key into the lock.
S: EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
N: Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs out. This seems to wake Harry up. The Athletic Beauty smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to brush his hair into place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods to the skis on her roof-rack.
C: HARRY
D: Skis, huh?
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: That's right.
C: HARRY
D: Great.

N: THE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS like a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG.
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere.
N: Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump as she smiles to herself.
S: INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM
N: Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993, A.M. SHARP. He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch. CLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8. ZOOM IN on the minute hand as it CLICKS TO EXACTLY 2:15. Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF. All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS. HIS POV - it's the Redneck trucker, Sea Bass.

E: re: suitcases in back seat
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've got to get away from my boyfriend.
N: He's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid accident-prone guys. Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD, FALLS TO THE GROUND, THEN QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.
C: HARRY
D: Here, this is a little loose.
E: holding out mirror
N: She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a cigarette.
C: HARRY
D: Allow me...
E: CONT'D
N: He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish. The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.)
C: HARRY
D: Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks him over and smiles.
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Why not? You seem pretty harmless. I'll give you my number. Just let me find a pen.
N: As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE! He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe, but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still searching for a pen.
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: I know I have one here somewhere...
E: CONT'D
N: Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames. This only helps to fan them.
C: HARRY
D: Look, why don't you just tell it to me, I've got a good memory.

C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Are you sure you won't forget?
C: HARRY

N: Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from screaming.

S: INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM
N: Sea Bass has his meaty paw wrapped around Lloyd's neck as he slides him up the wall of the toilet stall.
C: SEA BASS
D: First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm gonna kill you. Any last request?
C: LLOYD
D: Um, yeah could you do it the other way around?
N: Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees. Then the trucker steps back and UNDOES HIS FLY. The sound of the zipper brings a green color to Lloyd's face. ON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken. In his desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the toilet, EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE. Harry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND SEA BASS UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS PANTS UNDONE. Harry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in. Then he lets out an admonishing WHISTLE.

D: Not at that height it's not.

C: LLOYD
D: Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night.
C: HARRY
D: Good man.

D: Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize.

D: That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there?
C: LLOYD

C: LLOYD
D: Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and shine. You were the one who was asleep,
E: sing-song LAUGHS
N: numbskull. Here, take a sip of coffee. You're delirious. A confused Harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing terrain. Then something starts to awn on him. Slowly.
C: HARRY
D: Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west?
C: LLOYD
D: In our country it does, yes.

C: LLOYD
D: Well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. If we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out.
N: Harry thinks about this.
C: HARRY
D: You know, you're absolutely right, Lloyd.
N: He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward the highway.
C: LLOYD
D: Where you going?
C: HARRY
D: Home. I'm walking home.
C: LLOYD
D: You can't be serious.
C: HARRY
D: Why not? We're probably only five miles away.
E: sarcastic
N: Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches.

D: Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you never screwed up. Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his friend. He seems completely rained.
E: CALLING OUT
C: HARRY
D: Look, man... I'm sorry. I never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. You've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. But let's face it, Lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in Aspen. There's nothing waiting for me anywhere.

N: Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping at his clothes. A station wagon blows by and throws a BAG OF GARBAGE out the window. It lands at Harry's feet. EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek (like the Indian in the commercial). PAN DOWN to the bag of garbage. We see it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open. Suddenly a HEARSE pulls up and stops. It's an ominous-looking vehicle and Harry hesitates. Then the passenger window rolls down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel.
C: LLOYD
D: Got room for one more, if you still want to go to Aspen.
N: Harry looks the hearse over.
C: HARRY
D: Where'd you find this baby?

D: Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that?
N: Lloyd thinks hard about this.
C: LLOYD
D: We were never Cub Scouts.

N: Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse. Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is a CADILLAC.
S: INT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY
N: (This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and a WOMAN are arguing.
C: WOMAN
D: I married a cheapskate.
C: MAN
D: Shut your trap, Gerdie.
C: WOMAN
D: I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be able to show my face again.
C: MAN
D: I knew something good would come out of this.
C: WOMAN
D: We could have given him a more ignified burial.
C: MAN
D: Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember what he got us for our twenty-fifth? A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm gonna spend a load to get him planted.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: While the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY FOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY SUPERMARKET - DAY
N: Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back. Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER AND WIPE THEIR HANDS OFF. ON THE LEAD CAR OF THE PROCESSION - The Woman's jaw is practically on the floor.
C: WOMAN
D: You son-of-a-bitch! I want a ivorce!

S: EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - DAY
N: The boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows, studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of the ski town.
C: LLOYD
D: Isn't this wonderful? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for?
C: HARRY
D: How about food and shelter?
C: LLOYD
D: You're so materialistic. Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary. Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two?
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes the lovely young lady reside?
C: LLOYD
D: Um... good question.
N: Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone booth next to them.
C: HARRY
D: Well what's her last name? We'll look it up in the phone book.
C: LLOYD
D: Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I caught that either.
N: Harry's concern grows.
C: HARRY
D: What about the briefcase, Lloyd? There must've been a name on it, right?
C: LLOYD
D: Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather.
E: brightening
C: HARRY
D: What is it?
C: LLOYD
D: Samsonite spelled just like it sounds.
N: Harry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HEARSE - NIGHT
N: The car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a picturesque bridge. Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the front seat as a LOUD, ICY WIND WHIPS though the hearse. They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and sipping it.
C: HARRY
D: Any soup left?
C: LLOYD
D: A little. Shall we share it?
C: HARRY
D: Please.
N: Lloyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.
C: LLOYD
D: Mmmm mmmm good...
N: Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry. Harry notices something and leans toward him.
C: HARRY
D: Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth. Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.
C: LLOYD
D: Hmmm... looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky.
N: HARRY STARES AT IT. THEN:
C: HARRY
D: Wanna split it?
C: LLOYD
D: You're pathetic. Get your own.
N: Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it. Another gust of wind swirls around them.
C: HARRY
D: I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd.
C: LLOYD
D: Roll up your window.
C: HARRY
D: It is rolled up.
C: LLOYD
D: Then I guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter.
C: HARRY
D: What anti-cold system?
N: Lloyd points to the dash.
C: LLOYD
D: Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder.
N: Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted. He opens the car door and starts to climb out.
C: LLOYD
D: What are you going out there for?
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: To warm up.
S: EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT
N: Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side.
C: LLOYD
D: What are you worrying about now?
C: HARRY
D: I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you.
C: LLOYD
D: Huh?
N: Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd manages to evade his grasp.
C: LLOYD
D: Harry, calm down! You're acting like a wild animal!
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd!
C: LLOYD
D: Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist!
N: Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated, Harry opens the car and PULLS THE BRIEFCASE OUT.
C: LLOYD
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along.
N: Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.
C: LLOYD
D: Don't do anything foolish, Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.
C: LLOYD
D: You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this!
N: Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose of the briefcase.
C: LLOYD
D: Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get better, I promise! In fact, I think
E: CONT'D
N: I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's yours, Harry, all yours! Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.
C: HARRY
D: You're bluffing.
C: LLOYD
D: No I'm not, man look.
N: Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints at it.
C: HARRY
D: That's a filling, you liar!
N: Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs, but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another in the snow, rolling over and over. Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on top and CLASPS HIS HANDS AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT.
C: HARRY
D: I used to have a life! A miserable one, but a life, nonetheless!
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S. behind his friend.
C: LLOYD
D: Harry, look!
E: CHOKED VOICE
N: Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd as we see THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND, REVEALING STACKS AND STACKS OF BIG, BEAUTIFUL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - NIGHT
N: Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.
C: LLOYD
D: Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel.
C: HARRY
D: Sounds good.
C: LLOYD
D: And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs.
C: HARRY
D: We'll be meticulous right down to the last penny.
C: LLOYD
D: That way, whatever we borrow we can pay back.
C: HARRY
D: Absolutely. We're good for it.
C: LLOYD
D: You know, as soon as we get jobs.
C: HARRY
D: It'll come right out of our first paycheck.

S: INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
N: A tuxedoed Bell Captain, BARNARD, is showing the guys around an ENORMOUS AND LUXURIOUS SUITE. The place is big enough to throw a touchdown bomb in.
C: BARNARD
D: ...This is the Hotel Danbury's Presidential Suite, gentlemen. It's normally reserved for royalty, visiting dignitaries, and illustrious stars of stage and take it.
N: The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.
C: BARNARD
D: Very good, sir. Are there any bags you'd like sent up?
E: CONT'D
C: LLOYD
D: Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our own chicks.
C: BARNARD
D: I wasn't talking about ladies.
E: peevish
C: HARRY
D: Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up. What are their names?
N: Barnard SIGHS.
C: BARNARD
D: Sir, I meant your luggage.
N: Harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile.
C: LLOYD
D: Tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow?
N: The Bell Captain nods.
C: BARNARD
D: I'll bring you a menu.
C: LLOYD
D: Don't bother. Just order us one of everything.
N: At this, Harry serves Lloyd a reproachful look.
C: HARRY
D: One of everything? Lloyd...
N: Lloyd looks guilty.
C: LLOYD
D: Oh, sorry. Make that two of everything. Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in Barnard's top pocket.
E: beat
C: LLOYD
D: And here you go, Barney. You keep us happy, we'll keep you happy.
E: CONT'D
N: The Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip.
C: BARNARD
D: Yes, sir!
N: He bows and leaves the room. Then Lloyd cracks open the briefcase and inserts a SMALL PIECE OF PAPER.
C: LLOYD
D: Our first IOU. Signed and dated.
E: proudly

C: MARY
E: o.s.
N: COME IN...
S: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the French windows when Helen ENTERS.
C: HELEN
D: I brought you some tea. I thought it might help you relax.
N: Mary smiles.
C: MARY
D: Thank you.
N: She takes a mug, sips, and pulls back.
C: MARY
D: Yech! What's in this, whiskey?
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: Uh, sorry... that one's mine.
N: Helen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one.
C: HELEN
D: Feeling any better, honey?
E: CONT'D
N: Mary can't take her eyes from the window.
C: MARY
D: Just knowing that Melvin's out there, being held by God knows who... It's all my fault. I should've been there.
E: fighting back tears
C: HELEN
D: Bullshit. You can't blame yourself for this. If you'd been there they would've taken you, too.
N: Helen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit.
C: MARY
D: Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over
N: with.
C: HELEN
D: Now Mary, everything that can be done is being done. You've got to stop torturing yourself.
C: MARY
D: What am I supposed to do? Go about my life as if everything were fine?
C: HELEN
D: That's exactly what you should do. Get the hell out more, go skiing, socialize. Don't you see, honey? We can't let on that anything is wrong. If the press or authorities get wind of this, the kidnappers might panic. Who knows what they'd do to poor Melvin then?

S: EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY
N: The Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse. Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely.
S: INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT
N: The huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies. Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the mountain view.
C: HARRY
D: Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming.
C: LLOYD
D: It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time.
C: HARRY
D: And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money.
N: Harry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty puff, and EXHALES.
C: HARRY
D: You know, Lloyd, I think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today.
E: CONT'D
N: He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.
C: LLOYD
D: What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right?
C: HARRY
D: Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards?
C: LLOYD
D: Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis. This suddenly makes sense to Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them.
N: Lloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.
C: LLOYD
D: Where'd this come from?
C: HARRY
D: I bought it.
E: sheepishly
C: LLOYD
D: What for?
C: HARRY
D: I like the feel of it against my skin... ...I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it.
E: defensive
N: Lloyd inspects it more closely.
C: LLOYD
D: Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL?
C: HARRY
D: Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few eccentricities.
N: There's a KNOCK on the door.
C: LLOYD
D: Enter, parlez vous!
N: The Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket and a newspaper under his arm.
C: BARNARD
D: I brought you your newspaper and some champagne, gentlemen. Unfortunately, we didn't seem to have the, um, label you requested.
N: Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.
C: LLOYD
D: All out of Boone's Farm, huh?
C: BARNARD
D: You have a rapier wit, sir. I took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: Dom Perignon.
C: LLOYD
D: Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?
N: Lloyd smiles and over tips him.
C: BARNARD
D: Thank you so much, sir.
N: He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads for the door.
C: LLOYD
D: Oh, one more thing: You can dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's face it, Barney, we're all from the same mold. We just have a little more dough than you right now.
E: winks
N: Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger, sending out a resonant RING.
C: HARRY
D: Cocktail hour has commenced!
N: He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins thumbing through the newspaper.
C: HARRY
D: Hey, later on what do you say we...?
E: CONT'D
N: He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something he's found in the paper.
C: HARRY
D: Lloyd... you okay?
E: CONT'D
C: LLOYD
D: Harry, it's her.
E: dumbstruck
C: HARRY
D: Who?
C: LLOYD
D: Mary with the briefcase. This is her...
N: He shoves the newspaper at Harry. CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST PRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneath this is a photograph of Mary with her parents.

D: Mary Swanson...
E: CONT'D

D: Come on, Cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball...
N: Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman" plays over a... MONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER: -The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed. -Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both guys' hair in curlers. -Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor. Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing. -We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to the floor to reveal a PILE OF NOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS. -Then a shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN OVER to Lloyd's bare feet he has toe nails like Howard Hughes. Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety goggles tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric sander. -Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles. -Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back. -The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed, but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in. -Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves. -This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up. PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND LLOYD.

S: EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT
N: Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange. (THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred dollars.
C: LLOYD
D: Thanks for the lift, Barney.
S: INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY
N: Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them the once over.
C: ANDRE
D: Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.
N: Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.
C: LLOYD
D: This should cover a couple plates.
C: HARRY
D: I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds?
N: Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.
C: LLOYD
D: Put us down for four plates, my good man.
N: They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.
C: J.P. SHAY

C: LLOYD
D: What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated.
C: HARRY
D: So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound.
N: He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party. Lloyd rolls his eyes.
C: LLOYD
D: Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me?
C: HARRY
D: Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence.
N: The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar.
C: LLOYD
D: Two martinis, straight up. As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away.
E: to BARTENDER
C: LLOYD
D: Shut up, Harry.
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: I didn't say anything.

D: I read you like a book.
C: HARRY
D: Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say?
C: LLOYD
D: You were gonna say: (in Harry's looped
C: VOICE)
D: 'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.'
N: Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.
C: LLOYD
D: And I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly.
E: CONT'D
N: The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s. CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and Elizabeth Swanson.

D: If I could have your attention, please...
N: The crowd QUIETS.
C: ANDRE

Our SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY- three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight, we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our twenty-fourth. The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the podium.
C: MR. SWANSON
D: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Icelandic Snow Owl.

C: MR. SWANSON
D: Here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat. And, God willing, with your help and that of the Society's, we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more.
N: More APPLAUSE.
C: MR. SWANSON
D: Again, thank you, and enjoy your evening. Oh, and feel free to take a closer look at our new friends here. Enjoy.
E: CONT'D
N: The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.
C: LLOYD
D: Two more, please.
N: Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.
C: HARRY
D: Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out.
C: LLOYD
D: I can't help it. This is a very important night for me.
E: MORE
C: LLOYD
D: Harry, have you ever wondered why you and I never have long-term girlfriends?
E: CONT'D beat
C: HARRY
D: What are you talking about? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks.
C: LLOYD
D: That was a fluke. The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the C word.
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: That's crazy. We live for the C word.
C: LLOYD
D: I'm talking bout commitment.
C: HARRY
D: Oh.
E: beat
C: LLOYD
D: Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one. Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart.
E: beat
N: Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room. HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE OF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING A spectacular black cocktail dress. Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.
C: LLOYD
D: Oh shit, there she is.
E: CONT'D
C: HARRY
D: Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd. She's an angel. Well, what are you waiting for? Get over there and talk to her.
E: checking her out beat
C: LLOYD
D: She's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her.
C: HARRY
D: You have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you.
C: LLOYD
D: And then what? She'll take it back and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.
N: Harry thinks about this a moment.
C: HARRY
D: Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. Don't quit on the last fifty feet.
C: LLOYD
D: Wait a second, I have an idea. You go over and introduce yourself. That way you can build me up so when I come along I won't have to brag about myself. Tell her I'm good-looking and I'm rich and I have a rapist's wit.
E: brightening
C: HARRY
D: I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes.
N: Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.
C: LLOYD
D: Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another. Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. Please.
N: Harry SIGHS.
C: HARRY
D: All right. But you're gonna owe me a big one for this.
N: Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.
C: HARRY
D: Nice set of hooters you got there.
E: CONT'D
N: Mary turns to Harry, stunned.
C: MARY
D: I beg your pardon?
C: HARRY
D: The owls. They're beautiful.
C: MARY
D: Oh. Yeah. Are you a bird lover?
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: Well, I used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson.
N: She smiles at this.
C: MARY
D: Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how
N: are you involved with them?
C: HARRY
D: Oh, I've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; I've even bred them.
C: MARY
D: Really? Any unusual breeding?
C: HARRY
D: Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu.
C: MARY
D: Really? That's weird.
C: HARRY
D: Yeah. We called it a Bullshit. Just a little breeder joke.
E: breaks out LAUGHING
N: She seems strangely charmed by this.
C: HARRY
D: Anyway, the real reason I came over is because I want to introduce you to a friend of mine.
E: CONT'D
N: Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a martini and looking a little sloshed.
C: HELEN
D: Mary, I don't believe I've met your friend.
C: MARY
D: Actually, we haven't been introduced yet. I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my stepmother, Helen.
E: holds out hand
C: HARRY
D: Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both.
C: HELEN
D: I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne. I was hoping we'd get a chance to meet.
C: HARRY
D: You were?
E: taken aback
C: HELEN
D: That tuxedo I love a man with a sense of humor. So does Mary.
N: Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Really?
N: For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it.
C: HARRY
D: Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh?
E: CONT'D
C: MARY
D: Helen, you're embarrassing me.
C: HELEN
D: Well you are, aren't you? Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So what do you say, Harry? Are you available?
E: to Harry
N: Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful Lloyd.
C: HARRY
D: Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball.
N: Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.
C: HARRY
D: Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure.
E: CONT'D
N: ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.
C: LLOYD
D: How come you didn't call me over?
C: HARRY
D: Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow.
N: Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's SPEECHLESS.
C: LLOYD
D: Wha... you... I... it's... I love you, man. I love you!
E: smiles
N: Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE.
C: HARRY
D: Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene.
N: Lloyd steps back elated.
C: LLOYD
D: This calls for a toast!
N: He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it.
C: LLOYD
D: You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND ZIPS ACROSS THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN WIDER- EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!, and a THUMP! A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage. THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to extinction. Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar.
C: HARRY
D: I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd.
E: under breath
N: The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't look very happy.

N: Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand while J.P. Shay looks on nervously.
C: J.P. SHAY
D: Maybe it was just a coincidence.
C: ANDRE
D: Don't be stupid. It's a message, plain and simple: We killed their bird, now they killed ours.
C: J.P. SHAY
D: But how could anybody off a bird with a cork?
C: ANDRE
D: These guys arent' just anybody. They're good. Look what they did to Mental. He was the best, and yet he fell right into their web.
C: J.P. SHAY
D: But the bastards already got our money. What the hell more could they want?

S: INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - THE NEXT MORNING
N: A jubilant Lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror. In the b.g., Harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a pair of thermal tights.
C: LLOYD
D: Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs. Mary Christmas. You
N: know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, Har?
C: HARRY
D: Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? I mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type.
C: LLOYD
D: Impossible. I know my type when I see it. Now let me get this straight, she wants me to meet her at the Avalanche Bar and Grill on Main Street?
C: HARRY
D: That's what she said. Ten o'clock sharp.
N: This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up.
C: LLOYD
D: Time out. Where are going ressed like that.
C: HARRY
D: I, uh, thought while you were making your love connection I'd try my luck on the slopes.
C: LLOYD
D: You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights?
C: HARRY
D: These aren't tights. They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.
C: LLOYD
D: But you can see the outline of your who-who.
N: Harry looks down at his crotch.
C: HARRY
D: Really?
C: LLOYD
D: Turn sideways.
N: Harry turns his profile against the window.

N: ESTABLISHING SHOT of the building.
S: INT. ASPEN BASE LODGE
N: People are putting their boots on and their skis are lined up on the wall behind them. Mary is waiting by the fireplace in an incredibly sexy snowsuit. Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously. As he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON. He kicks over a row of skis and gets glares from all sides. Finally he reaches her, OUT OF BREATH.
C: HARRY
D: Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things.
S: EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY
N: Harry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair. The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride. Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be stretching.
C: HARRY
D: You take the first run alone. I'm gonna loosen up down here.

D: I'm sorry, we don't open until eleven. This is disconcerting news to Lloyd.

D: I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait at the bar?
N: The Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY
N: Harry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top. Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously.
C: MARY
D: Beautiful day, huh, Harry?
C: HARRY
D: Glorious.
N: Mary takes a DEEP BREATH.
C: MARY
D: God, it feels so good to get up here. I haven't been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks.
C: HARRY
D: Why not?
C: MARY
D: There's been... family problems. I on't want to bore you with them.
E: evasive
C: HARRY
D: Thanks.
N: He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar.
C: HARRY
D: Oh, look... frost.
E: CONT'D
N: He licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge.

D: Sure. I do this all the time... CUT TO:

E: lisping off their looks
N: The two kids just stare at him.

S: INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON
N: A despondent Lloyd's got a couple of empties in front of him now. The bar is open and there are a few CUSTOMERS sprinkled about. Lloyd takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the clock on the wall. It's 12:30. We see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to him. PAN OVER to reveal that it's the Athletic Beauty that Harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop.
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Hi.
N: Lloyd GRUNTS a hello.
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Bad day, huh?
E: CONT'D
N: Lloyd GRUNTS once more.

S: EXT. BASE LODGE - AFTERNOON
N: Mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and stops with a snow-spraying flourish. She looks around the outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE- TAKE. MARY'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO THE CHAIR LIFT (WHICH has been removed from the cable). He's drinking a cup of coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of the other SKIERS. There's a MIME performing in the b.g. BACK TO SCENE

C: SHAY
D: You're luck just ran out, pal.
N: As his trigger finger TWITCHES with anticipation, we go BACK TO SCENE
C: MARY
D: This is silly. Let me help you...
N: Mary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously. She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY... FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly, his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain:
C: MIME
D: GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!
N: The poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him.

C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: ...Anyway, after my boyfriend backed into my garage for the third time, I said to myself, 'Run, Cathy, run for your life before he kills you both'. Then you know what the klutz does and to be perfectly honest, I on't really care. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not very good company today. I'll say. I have an idea. Why don't you tell me a little about yourself.

D: So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?

D: Better make it quarter to eight. I've got a few things to take care of first.

C: HARRY
D: Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a nice ring to it.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - EVENING
N: Lloyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while Harry feigns surprise at what he's just heard.
C: HARRY
D: It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd. She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are you sure you went to the right bar?
C: LLOYD
D: Believe me, it was the right place. I don't know, Har, maybe she just had second thoughts.
E: SIGHS
C: HARRY
D: I have a hard time believing that, Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't wait to see you again.
N: Harry paces back and forth when suddenly SOMETHING OCCURES TO HIM.
C: HARRY
D: Wait a minute...
E: CONT'D
C: LLOYD
D: What?
C: HARRY
D: It just occurred to me. She must've meant ten o'clock at night.
C: LLOYD
D: Do ya think...?
E: brightening
C: HARRY
D: Of course! Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning?
C: LLOYD
D: I just figured she was a raging alcoholic.
E: shrugging
N: Harry BARKS OUT A LAUGH at their stupidity.
C: HARRY
D: Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?
C: LLOYD
D: I knew there was an explanation. And here I thought she was standing me up.
C: HARRY
D: That'll teach you to jump to conclusions. Anyway, since you have your night all
E: beat
N: planned, I think I'll run out and catch a flick. As Harry walks into the closet to change, Lloyd clenches his fist and glares after him. Then he regains his composure and moves to the bar.
C: LLOYD
D: Will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out?
C: HARRY
D: Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances.
E: o.s.
N: Lloyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF EX-LAX. LLOYD DUMPS THE ENTIRE PACK INTO ONE MUG AND MIXES IT IN. WHEN HARRY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT AND TIE, LLOYD DOES A DOUBLE- take.
C: LLOYD
D: Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you?
C: HARRY
D: Uh... it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door.

D: I see.
N: Lloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his own glass.

S: EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT
N: The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets his insides under control, and continues to the front porch, where he RINGS the bell. Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings.
C: MARY
D: Hi. Come on in.
S: INT. SWANSON CHALET
N: Harry follows her inside.

D: Make yourself at home. I'm almost ready. Just give me one more minute.
N: As she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's UPSET STOMACH again. He notices a bathroom off the hallway and rushes inside.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: HOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and nestles onto the throne. He lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF as he does his business, then leans over and SLIDES OPEN THE WINDOW to air the room out. He's still glued to the toilet when he hears a KNOCK on the door.

D: You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were.
C: HARRY
D: Guess not.
C: LLOYD
D: I mean, if one beautiful girl could rip us apart like this, then it seems our friendship isn't worth a damn. Maybe we should call it quits right here.
E: beat
C: HARRY
D: Just tell me where to sign, bud.
N: Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING COCKED.
C: ANDRE
D: Okay, which one of you losers wants to die first?
N: The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD.
C: HARRY
D: I wouldn't pull that trigger if I were you.
C: ANDRE
D: Why not? It'll look like just another Aspen love triangle. You caught the two of them in bed, handcuffed them to the post, murdered them, and killed yourself.
C: HARRY
D: Except you're forgetting one minor etail.
E: smug
C: ANDRE
D: What's that?
N: Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful.
C: HARRY
D: If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself.
C: ANDRE
D: Huh?
E: puzzled
C: HARRY
D: You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. In other words, I am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened
N: idiot --
C: ANDRE
D: --Shut up!
N: Mary sees that they're in deep shit now.
C: MARY
D: What about my husband? Did you kill him, too?
C: HARRY
D: Husband? What husband?
C: LLOYD
D: Mary's married, Harry.
C: ANDRE
D: No need to worry about Melvin. Now this is the last time I'll ask: Who wants to die first?
E: beat
N: Harry gestures with his head at Mary.
C: HARRY
D: Kill her. The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. It would've saved us a lot of trouble.
N: Andre points the gun at Mary.
C: LLOYD
D: No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the one who got you into this mess.
N: Andre points the gun at Lloyd.
C: HARRY
D: No, wait, do me first. I'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve it.
N: Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.
C: LLOYD
D: Jesus Christ! You killed my best friend, you bastard!
N: Andre smiles.
C: ANDRE
D: If it's any consolation, you're about to be reunited.
N: He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand. ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol at the stunned Nicholas Andre.
C: LLOYD
D: Harry! You're alive!
N: Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS storm in with their weapons drawn. COP #1 Get your hands up, asshole! Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events. There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She flashes an ID.
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
C: LLOYD
D: You gotta be kidding.
E: dumbstruck
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Good work, Harry.
N: Lloyd looks to his friend, confused. Harry opens his shirt, revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST.
C: HARRY
D: She grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. They slapped this on me and gave me a gun.
C: LLOYD
D: But how did you...?
E: to Athletic Beauty
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: We've been following you two all the way from Providence. Mr. and Mrs. Swanson had a homing device plated in the briefcase.
N: The guys glance guiltily at one another.
C: HARRY
D: Yeah, about that dough...
C: ATHLETIC BEAUTY
D: Every bill was counterfeit and marked.
N: Harry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT
N: There's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly.
C: LLOYD
D: She's something, ain't she, Har?
C: HARRY
D: You were right, Lloyd. She was efinitely worth the trip.
C: LLOYD
D: Guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us.
N: Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.
C: MELVIN
D: Oh god, baby, I missed you!
N: Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.
C: MELVIN
D: I can't thank you enough, fellas. It was so darn dank in that well, I really thought it would be the death of me.
E: CONT'D
N: Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at each other, and we
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LOBBY - HOTEL DANBURY - THE NEXT DAY
N: Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.
S: EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY
N: The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain, Barnard.
C: HARRY
D: Hey, Barney...
C: BELL CAPTAIN
D: Yes, gentlemen?
C: LLOYD
D: Look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay.
C: HARRY
D: And we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony.
C: BELL CAPTAIN
D: Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The Swanson family has promised to reimburse everyone.
N: This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered to the front door.
C: LLOYD
D: Well, anyway, thanks again for everything.
N: They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:
C: BARNARD
D: Where are you two headed?
C: HARRY
D: I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home.
C: BARNARD
D: Why not right here?
N: Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.
C: LLOYD
D: This joint is a little out of our budget, Barney.
C: BARNARD
D: Oh, I think we might be able to find you a free room somewhere -- after all, like you once told me, we're all from the same mold. You just don't have any dough right now.
E: smiling winks
N: The guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.
C: HARRY
D: Are you on the level?
C: BARNARD
D: Absolutely. We'll just slide you into one of the employee rooms...
N: The guys beam at this.
C: BARNARD
D: ...Provided, of course, you don't mind working one or two afternoons a week.
E: CONT'D
N: Harry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:
C: LLOYD
D: You know what, Barney, I think we'll take out chances down the road.
N: Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their hearse and drive off.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
N: As the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:
C: HARRY
D: Since we're finished elbow-rubbing, what next, lloyd?
E: v.o.
C: LLOYD
D: I say we head due south and try a little nose-rubbing with some of them slinky eskimo babes.
E: v.o.
C: HARRY
D: Now you're talking my language. You know I got a weakness for blondes.
E: v.o.
N: As they head toward their next adventure, the CAMERA PULLS UP, UP, UP... END CREDITS THE END
