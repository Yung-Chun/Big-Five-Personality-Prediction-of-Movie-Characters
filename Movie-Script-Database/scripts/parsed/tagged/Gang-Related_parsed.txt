T: FADE IN:
N: NEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel. ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking lot. Then the curtain closes.
S: INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in his late thirties. Slightly nervous. Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.
C: DIVINCI
D: Says here they got slips in Honolulu. 325 a month. Utilities included. That's not bad.
N: Rodriguez sits down.
C: DIVINCI
D: But I gotta get at least a forty footer. It'll handle rough water better and I'll need the room if I'm gonna live on it.
N: Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks up.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I don't know how you do it.
C: DIVINCI
D: What?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: How you can think about Hawaii now?
C: DIVINCI
D: My heart's in Hawaii.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: You never been there. How can your heart be there.
C: DIVINCI
D: You're tellin' me there's no place you'd rather be other than here?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: No, I'm saying I just don't know how you can think about Hawaii right now.
C: DIVINCI
D: If I was in Hawaii right now, I wouldn't be thinking about here. See the difference?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: No.
C: DIVINCI
D: Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: But I'm here, I know I'm here, I don't like being here, but I can't be anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That's what I'm asking.
C: DIVINCI
D: Focus.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Focus.
N: Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: It's time. No more Hawaii, okay? Focus on this.
C: DIVINCI
D: Aloha.
E: smiles
N: Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Aloha my ass.
E: to himself
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT
N: Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past. We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.
S: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life. She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her skirt hiked up on her leg.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Left at the corner.
N: Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy bass.
S: EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
N: The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out, leads him to SEVEN. Knocks. The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens. Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT
N: Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one has followed, then shuts the door.
C: DIVINCI
D: Hope you don't mind me checkin' you for weapons.
C: HUDD
D: Hell yes I mind.
N: Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.
C: HUDD
D: I just don't want no man handlin' me.
N: Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.
C: DIVINCI
D: Okay. Check him.
N: Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather not have the job, but there's no choice.
C: HUDD
D: Lotta good hidin' places on this body. Check good.
N: Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.
C: HUDD
D: Careful. It's loaded.
N: Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the least and she gives him a good going over.
C: CYNTHIA
D: He's got nothin'.
N: She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch and seductively crosses her legs. Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd. Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.
C: HUDD
D: Not bad, not bad. Any more where this came from?
C: DIVINCI
D: Maybe.
C: HUDD
D: Then maybe we talk again.
C: DIVINCI
D: Maybe.
N: Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.
C: HUDD
D: Told you there was a lotta good hidin' places on this body.
N: Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag. Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.
C: HUDD
D: Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin' places, too.
N: Then Hudd smiles and exits.
S: EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking lot.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the buildings are boarded up.
S: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has changed. More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up fast. Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass. He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW EXPLODING. THE CADILLAC swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK REGAL -- screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing PLASTIC GLOVES. Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The man reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.
S: INT. BUICK REGAL - NIGHT
N: Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Come on! Hurry up!
N: Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in. Rodriguez floors it. THE BUICK tears off down the dark street.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a MAN passed out in the street. Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at the man passed out in the street. His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is. Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a bottle in a bag.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street before you get run over. Joe, wake up!
N: She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back. Dead drunk.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You're in the street, Joe. Get outa the street.
N: The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl -- toward the middle of the street.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Other way, Joe.
N: Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for a moment. He is truly pathetic.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better off right there. I don't think you'd even feel it.
N: Cynthia enters the building next to the alley.
T: CUT TO:
S: CYNTHIA - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: asleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and close. Cynthia wakes.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Who is it?
N: Divinci crosses to the bed.
C: DIVINCI
D: Got your money.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Put it on the table.
N: She closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep.
C: DIVINCI
D: Tired?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: DIVINCI
D: I'm not.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Take a sleeping pill. There's some in my purse.
C: DIVINCI
D: You want your money?
N: Cynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's smiling, holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I already worked for that.
N: Divinci unzips his pants.
C: DIVINCI
D: This is a bonus.
C: CYNTHIA
D: For who?
N: Divinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci starts to undress.
C: DIVINCI
D: This ain't my fault. This is a failure of our educational system. If you hadn't fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school, you wouldn't be here now.
C: CYNTHIA
D: So what's your excuse?
C: DIVINCI
D: I'm in love.
N: Cynthia just stares at him for a long beat. Then she unbuckles Divinci's pants.
T: CUT TO:
N: KEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHT A door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed with.
C: VIC
D: Keepin' some late hours.
T: Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: What the hell you doin'? What're my neighbors gonna think?
C: VIC
D: I apologize. I understand your concerns. But you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what I can do.
C: VIC
D: Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The point of which is, I already have a fuckin' miserable life. So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit.
N: Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.
C: VIC
D: All I'm askin' is that you be responsible. Is that unreasonable?
N: Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some of his night's earnings.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Four thousand is all I got.
C: VIC
D: I am proportionally reassured. You purchased yourself an extension.
N: Vic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' idiot name is that?
T: CUTLESS SUPREME
N: It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain. I was born in the back seat. Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door.
T: CUT TO:
N: CREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying where they were shot. Overlapping CLOSE-UPS of EVIDENCE TAGS and SHELVING filled with EVIDENCE from hundreds of crime scenes. And CLOSE-SHOTS of CRIME SCENES -- chalk outlines -- bullet shells - bloody foot prints. And finally CRIME SCENE TAPE. The BLACK AND WHITE fades back into COLOR -- YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE surrounding the CADILLAC. We PULL BACK, revealing COPS controlling the area. It's early morning. A FEW PEOPLE have stopped to watch. But this is not a high traffic area. ANOTHER CAR pulls up. Unmarked. Two men get out. We FOLLOW BEHIND THEM as they approach the Cadillac and PATROLMAN MAHONEY, who knows them.
C: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
D: Another day, another body. Where you wanna start?
C: FIRST MAN
D: A hit?
C: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
D: Looks like. Could be gang related.
N: And now we SEE THE TWO MEN from the unmarked car. It's DIVINCI and RODRIGUEZ. Suit and ties. They act like they own the area. And they do.
C: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
D: Happened sometime last night, early morning, two, three o'clock. African- American male, looks like in his thirties. But even that's a guess. Half his head is on the upholstery.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Any witnesses?
C: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
D: Oh, sure, hundreds.
S: INT. CADILLAC - DAY
N: The bloody scene is untouched. Hudd's body is where it fell, on the seat. Dried blood everywhere. Divinci looks in.
C: DIVINCI
D: Fuckin' Animals.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
N: EVIDENCE ROOM. Behind a locked fenced in area. A DESK OFFICER checks in and out all evidence. He is twenty-eight, wears glasses, very clean cut. TWO DETECTIVES are checking in evidence as Divinci walks in.
C: FIRST DETECTIVE
D: ...three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.
N: The Desk Officer checks in the evidence.
C: DESK OFFICER
D: Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.
N: The two detectives wave hellos to Divinci as he approaches.
C: SECOND DETECTIVE
D: Heard you got a gang related. Lucky guy, Divinci. You get all the pretty ones.
E: SGT. GARDNER
C: DIVINCI
D: One less drug store on the street.
C: DESK OFFICER
D: And the world is a safer place.
N: The Desk Officer buzzes Divinci through the door. Divinci crosses to the -- EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM -- filled with shelves. Stacked with evidence from on-going investigations. And the shelves are full of guns, knives, bloody gloves, masks, shoes, etc. Divinci looks around, then removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE and the .44 from his pockets and places them back on one of the shelves. CASE NUMBER C-549087. One thing about the .44 which we can see now -- a BLACK STAIN on the metal of the handle.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY
N: Desks, phones, computers, typewriters and HOMICIDE DETECTIVES. Some witnesses being interviewed. Rodriguez is on the phone at his desk. He's in the middle of an interview as he fills out one of the many forms that complicate his life.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: -- a green car... you know what make... Maybe a Ford, uh-huh. You didn't see the license, did you?
E: into phone
N: Divinci comes back to his desk, next to Rodriguez. Rodriguez looks up. Divinci gives him a confident smile and brushes his hands together -- clean hands.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark... Uh-huh.
E: into phone
N: Divinci sits at his desk. He pulls an ADVERTISEMENT for a 42 FOOT SPORT FISHING BOAT out of his desk. He holds it up to Rodriguez, points to the boat.
C: DIVINCI
D: Wanna go for a ride?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: You think you could describe the driver? You bought it?
E: into phone covers phone; to Divinci
C: DIVINCI
D: As of last night, I've got the down. Just picture me under swayin' palms with a Mai Tai.
N: We can HEAR someone describing a felon over the phone, but Rodriguez isn't listening. He's looking at the boat.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Uh-huh. You're gonna buy it, no shit. When?
E: into phone covers phone
C: DIVINCI
D: Just a phone call away.
N: Divinci picks up the phone, starts to dial.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: That's really great, man.
N: Divinci smiles. Rodriguez suddenly realizes the person on the other end of the phone has stopped talking.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Uh-huh, okay... how tall was he?
E: back to phone
N: A heavy set man in his fifties approaches -- CAPTAIN HENDERSON.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: You got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th.
C: DIVINCI
D: I'm workin' it up now.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: Who's your second? In my office. Both of you.
E: Divinci points at Rodriguez
C: DIVINCI
D: Why?
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: Now.
N: Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads for the office -- an inner office of glass and wood. Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous. We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to, but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: What the hell --
N: Divinci motions "keep calm."
S: INT. CAPTAIN HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Henderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and Rodriguez enter. They aren't the only ones in the office. RICHARD SIMMS, thirty-two, trim, short cut hair, suit, is waiting.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez, this is Richard Simms. He's with the D.E.A. He wants to ask you some questions about your case.
C: DIVINCI
D: What's the occasion?
C: SIMMS
D: You get an i.d. on the victim?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We're waitin' for prints.
N: Divinci pulls out his note pad.
C: DIVINCI
D: Car was registered to --
C: SIMMS
D: -- Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado. Black.
C: DIVINCI
D: If you got all this, what d'you want from us?
C: SIMMS
D: ...The man in the car is Lionel Hudd.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: How d'you know that? What's goin' on here?
E: a little incensed to Henderson
C: SIMMS
D: Hudd was DEA, undercover.
N: Rodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer. On their frozen expressions we HEAR --
C: SIMMS
D: He was workin' a case on syndicate distribution of drugs on the south side. But every dealer we tagged kept getting killed. He finally got a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend of mine... I'm gonna nail the sonuvabitch who killed him.
E: O.S.
N: A long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then --
C: DIVINCI
D: We'll do everything we can to help.
T: CUT TO:
S: THE UNMARKED POLICE CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY
N: screeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT LOT. The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of his mind. Divinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired up and scared he can't stop moving.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST!
C: DIVINCI
D: Calm down!
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD!
C: DIVINCI
D: SHUT UP!
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!
N: Divinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing about.
C: DIVINCI
D: STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT!
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
N: Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on. They struggle --
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: LET GO OF ME!
N: -- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps on top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez mouth.
C: DIVINCI
D: Shut up and listen to me!
N: Rodriguez glares up at Divinci.
C: DIVINCI
D: They could be watchin' us right now you asshole. So fuckin' shape up! You got it?! I want you to nod!
E: nothing from Rodriguez
N: It takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls his gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt.
C: DIVINCI
D: Get the fuck up!
N: Rodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him, yanks him up. Pushes him to the car.
C: DIVINCI
D: Get in the car!
N: They move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger side. Gets in, slams the door shut.
S: INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY
N: They sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of the vacant lot. Breathing hard. Dirty. After a beat --
C: DIVINCI
D: There's no fuckin' reason to panic.
N: Rodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci incredulously.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you say no fuckin' reason to panic!
C: DIVINCI
D: Stop being an idiot! We're the cops on the case. It's our case. We are going to find the fuckin' killers.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: WE'RE THE FUCKIN' KILLERS!
C: DIVINCI
D: Since when does that matter?!
N: Rodriguez stares at Divinci for a beat, then we --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED - DAY
N: Rodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with a beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey.
C: DIVINCI
D: All they want is someone to go down for the crime, right? Do we care who goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As long as someone goes down for the crime. It's a slot that's gotta be filled.
N: Rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him --
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We killed a cop, doesn't that bother you?
C: DIVINCI
D: Of course it bothers me. What d'you want me to do, turn myself in? Well I'm not. That's the risk we take everyday, somebody might pop us, especially undercover like that. So he got popped. It happens.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Not by other cops!
C: DIVINCI
D: I patted him down! He wasn't wearin' a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how was I supposed to know?!
N: A moment of silence, then --
C: DIVINCI
D: Look, I feel just as bad as you do, but we gotta start thinkin' about us here. The important thing is we don't lose control of the case. We can never lose control of the case. Whatever evidence there is goes through us. We lay down the trail. Make it nice and logical. We're the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it's our classroom.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: What're you talkin' about, are you sayin' we stick somebody with this?
C: DIVINCI
D: Evidence points wherever we want it to point. Shit, we can provide so much evidence, even the asshole we pick will think he fuckin' killed him.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: You got some asshole in mind?
C: DIVINCI
D: Just don't worry. We'll find a killer. There's lots of 'em out there.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS, all in their twenties, are hanging on a street corner. Talking. Normal street traffic. They give a long hard look to an ATTRACTIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN who walks past. A little chatter. The UNMARKED CAR suddenly screeches to the curb. The black youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes after the tallest of the three. His name is JAMES. Rodriguez guns the car and gives chase on wheels. James darts across traffic. Divinci running hard after him. Rodriguez spins the car in a u-turn. Racing after them.
S: EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME
N: James darts down the alley. Narrow, dark, lined with trash bins. Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to catch him. James is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley, skidding to a stop. Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at James. No where for him to go. He slows down. Rodriguez moves in from his front, Divinci runs up from behind. James is disgusted.

C: JAMES
D: Friday night... last Friday night?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Where were you?

N: in plastic pages. A BINDER full of criminal portraits. Divinci is going through one book. Rodriguez searches another.
C: DIVINCI
D: Montrose LaJolla...
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We pulled him in last year for knifing that dealer on 32nd.
C: DIVINCI
D: Yeah. Almost killed him, remember? He'd be good. (calls out to ANOTHER
C: DETECTIVE)
D: Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla?
C: ANOTHER DETECTIVE
D: He's dead. His life partner killed him in a Domestic D about a month ago.
N: Rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Shit!
N: Divinci looks at him. Rodriguez is angry, tense. Divinci gives him a look telling him this is not the time and place for a discussion on this topic.
C: DIVINCI
D: Take it easy.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: This isn't gonna work!
N: Divinci leans toward Rodriguez.
C: DIVINCI
D: Nobody said it was gonna be easy. But let's not advertise our despair... Okay?
N: The PHONE RINGS. Divinci picks it up.
C: DIVINCI
D: Divinci.
E: into phone
S: INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Captain Henderson is sitting behind his desk. Divinci and Rodriguez are in front of him. Rodriguez is trying to hide his nervousness. Divinci is absolutely cool.
C: DIVINCI
D: This is our case! Not the goddamn DEA's!
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: It's been three days.
C: DIVINCI
D: We're not fuckin' magicians! What the hell is three days?! This is a goddamn murder case! It takes a little bit of goddamn time!
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: When a Federal Undercover Officer goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder case! I don't like the DEA on my ass any better than you like 'em on yours. But this is personal for them and they want answers. Forget your other cases and get something, anything that I can give to them. The last thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I. on my back, too.
N: Divinci and Rodriguez are quiet for a beat, then --
C: DIVINCI
D: We've got a couple leads. We need a little more time.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: I can't hold 'em off much longer.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: This is no fuckin' way to run an investigation.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: Let me tell you both something, if you don't solve this quick, they're gonna start askin' why? And they'll be lookin' to blame somebody in this department. So my advise to you is, get something fuckin' fast or turn over what you've got and get outa the way.
N: Rodriguez and Divinci are quiet for a moment, then --
C: DIVINCI
D: How much time we got?
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: A couple days. The funeral's this afternoon.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: What funeral?
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you there.
C: DIVINCI
D: What for? We didn't know him.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: How the hell do I know?! It's DEA, it's their thing. You're the cops on the case, I suppose they want you to know what a great guy Hudd was so you'll work all that harder to find his killer. Just go. It'll reassure 'em how much you care and keep 'em off my ass.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: MOURNERS gathered around the grave site. WIFE in tears. MOTHER in tears. The men trying their best to hold up. Beyond the family, DEA AGENTS. Simms among them. A show of support and solidarity. A REVEREND delivering --
C: REVEREND
D: -- and it is too easy to say that he was a good man in his job because he gave more than most. And it's too easy to say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than others. And it's too easy to say he was a good man at home with his family because he was always there when they needed him. Special Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a good man, he was an extraordinary man. And his death shall not be in vain.
N: CAMERA FINDS Divinci and Rodriguez at the back. Rodriguez looks nervous. Divinci notices. Their conversation is quiet.
C: DIVINCI
D: Don't Humpty Dumpty on me.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: What's that mean?
C: DIVINCI
D: Your cracks are startin' to show.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Bullshit.
E: covering
N: Divinci sees Simms approaching from the side.
C: DIVINCI
D: Get your balance. Here comes the King.
N: Rodriguez glances toward Simms as he walks up. The conversation is quiet. Not wanting to disturb the ceremony.
C: SIMMS
D: Glad you came... Anything break?
N: Divinci glances at Rodriguez.
C: DIVINCI
D: Nothin' to brag about. But we've got a couple new leads we're followin'.
C: SIMMS
D: ...Look, normally we'd be all over this, but your Captain seems to think you can do the job. It's your territory. I guess you know it better than anybody. And that can be worth a lot. But you understand... we won't wait forever.
N: Divinci is pissed. He doesn't like Simms.
C: DIVINCI
D: Just outa curiosity... What happened to his backup? You guys use backup on undercover don't you?
C: SIMMS
D: It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid backup would blow his cover. He was supposed to check in ten minutes after the deal went down. He never checked in.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We want this one as bad as you do. A cop's a cop. We're in this together, right?
N: Simms stares at Rodriguez and Divinci for a moment, then he returns his attention to the ceremony.
C: SIMMS
D: That's why I asked you to come here. Just so you knew that.

S: EXT. HOT DOG VENDOR STREET - DUSK
N: Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand, returning to their car parked curbside.
C: DIVINCI
D: He didn't have backup. You believe that?! Jesus what a dick.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I don't think we should criticize that particular decision of his.
C: DIVINCI
D: I don't care what the reasons are, you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger on a drug buy. You're just askin' for it. That's all I'm sayin'.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I don't trust those bastards. They're not waitin' for us. That's bullshit. They're runnin' their own investigation. I know it!
C: DIVINCI
D: Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from evidence. The car came from impound. So what's to find?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: That's what I'm afraid of. There's nothing for them to find. We were too good.
C: DIVINCI
D: So what're you worried about?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Nobody is that fuckin' good.
N: Divinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles.
C: DIVINCI
D: Except us.
T: CUT TO:
S: STRIPPER - INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
N: bumping and grinding her way through her performance. We don't see her face yet. Just her body. G-string and skin tight tank top. LOUD MUSIC. MEN in the audience appreciative. The room is smoky. LIGHTS swirl over the stage. The tank top comes off. WHISTLES and CHEERS. And now we see the dancer -- it's CYNTHIA.
S: INT. HALLWAY - BACK STAGE - NIGHT
N: Cynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high heels. She enters the dressing room.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Divinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little room. He's going through her purse. Cynthia stops when she sees him, then shuts the door.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I think this is breaking and entering, isn't it?
C: DIVINCI
D: I work homicide, I don't deal with that shit.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Learn anything you didn't already have on file?
E: puts on robe
C: DIVINCI
D: Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. Here I think you're just a hard case and I discover you've got a heart of gold. You're an organ donor. That's really nice. The only problem is, they'll never use your best parts.
E: holds up her drivers license
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'll make sure you get them.
C: DIVINCI
D: Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just surprised that we had something in common... Besides what we have in common.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one that beats.
C: DIVINCI
D: Cynthia... pretty name. What do the first three letters spell?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Don't get so clever. It's out of character.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Divinci and Cynthia are lying in bed. Divinci has his arm around her, but he's staring at the ceiling.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What's so interesting up there?
C: DIVINCI
D: Nothing.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Then why's it got all your attention?
C: DIVINCI
D: I'm thinkin', that's all.
C: CYNTHIA
D: About us?
C: DIVINCI
D: No.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Good.
N: Divinci looks at Cynthia.
C: DIVINCI
D: What if I was thinkin' about us?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Don't waste your time.
C: DIVINCI
D: What if I was?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Where's it gonna get us?
C: DIVINCI
D: Maybe I got plans.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just make you think somethin's gonna get better. I'm fine now. I don't need to get screwed up waitin' for something good to happen.
C: DIVINCI
D: I just want you to know, love is important to me.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Me, too.
C: DIVINCI
D: But more important is loyalty. Nothing is more important than that. Not love, not anything. Because loyalty is about respect. You can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty. I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect. And once it's gone, forget the love. So I am telling you, I am loyal to you. Like I'm loyal to my partner. We are closer than blood. And I trust him with my life.
N: Cynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci. She's actually, despite herself, a little touched.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Why're you telling me this?
C: DIVINCI
D: When you asked if I was thinkin' about us and I said I wasn't, I just want you to know that I do.
N: A beat, then --
C: CYNTHIA
D: Just don't ask me to marry you.
C: DIVINCI
D: Why aren't more women like you?
E: smiles
N: Divinci leans in and they kiss.

S: EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Divinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street to his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS SOMETHING BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol. A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun in his hand. Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when -- THE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a gun.
C: DIVINCI
D: You fuckin' idiot.
E: lowers gun
N: The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. Now we recognize Joe. Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops. Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again.
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe. Joe squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the light with an arm. We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside Joe's JACKET POCKET.
C: DIVINCI
D: What've we got here?
N: He pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44. Divinci looks at Joe.

N: Joe looks down at his hands -- he's holding the .44.
C: DIVINCI
D: It was in your pocket, Joe, your coat pocket. You must keep it for protection, right?
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't know.
C: DIVINCI
D: Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs protection. Especially a guy like you lives on the street, right?
N: Joe just stares at the gun.
C: DIVINCI
D: Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You don't have to worry about me, I'm not gonna hurt you.

C: DIVINCI
D: Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at something. Out the window, Joe. Look out the window.
N: Joe's eyes open. Divinci forces his head to the window.
C: DIVINCI
D: This is where it happened, Joe. I want you to remember it. This is where you killed him
N: Joe tries to turn to Divinci, but Divinci holds his head.
C: DIVINCI

C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Now?
C: DIVINCI
D: I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin' hand.
N: Rodriguez sits up in bed.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: He doesn't remember last Friday?

D: I want you to look at something.
N: The room is still dark. Curtains drawn. We now see Rodriguez. He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves. He hands Divinci POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS of the car, the street, the victim -- the murder scene. Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting position.
C: DIVINCI
D: There's the guy and the street and the car. You remember how you shot him.
N: Joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head.
C: DIVINCI
D: You don't remember? That's not what you told me last night.
N: Joe is confused.
C: DIVINCI
D: If you remember you can have a drink.
N: Joe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him.
C: DIVINCI
D: But you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself. You remember now don't you?
N: Joe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods.
C: DIVINCI
D: And where's your gun, Joe, where do you keep your gun?
N: Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid drains away and we CLOSE IN TIGHT until we can SEE LIONEL HUDD'S FACE as we --
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLOSE UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS Hudd dead. Blood on the windows. The street. Joe is drunk again. In a haze. Starts to lift the bottle. Rodriguez pulls it away. Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Why'd you kill him?
C: WILLIAM
D: I... don't know...
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: It was your gun.
C: WILLIAM

C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last name.
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't remember.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying to help you. What's your last goddamn name?
N: Joe shakes his head.
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't know.
N: Rodriguez suddenly smacks Joe on the side of the head when he tries to look back. Joe is surprised by the blow. Divinci pushes Rodriguez back. Shakes his head telling him to back off.
C: DIVINCI
D: Come on, we're all tired here, Joe. Just give us your last name.
E: to Joe; friendly
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't remember.

N: smiles and turns toward the man in the street. A .44 is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the APPROACHING CAR. The gun is in the hands of Joe. He is scared. The HEADLIGHTS COMING RIGHT AT HIM. He aims and FIRES the gun. THE FRONT WINDOW SHATTERS. And the car swerves to the curb.

S: INT. POLICE LINEUP ROOM - DAY
N: ROWS of seats face a small platform. The LINEUP WALL is striped with horizontal lines with HEIGHT NUMBERS. The brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery, which is in the dark. UNIFORMED GUARDS are on hand to make sure there is no discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and witness. SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters.

N: The six men obey. A couple keep their heads down. The others squint from the bright lights.
C: THE VOICE
D: Lift your heads, look straight.
N: Heads are lifted. Eyes front. But we only recognize one of them, standing third from the left. It's Joe. Divinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery.
C: DIVINCI
D: Take your time. Try and remember his face.
N: Cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. She looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and Divinci watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then she turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers --
C: CYNTHIA
D: I know him.
N: Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it looking like he's coaching her.
C: DIVINCI
D: If you can identify the man --
C: CYNTHIA
D: I know him.
E: whisper
C: DIVINCI
D: Just tell us which one.
N: Cynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No. I fucking know him.

C: DIVINCI
D: There's no problem! Do you see him up there?!
E: to Cynthia; pointedly
C: CYNTHIA
D: You don't understand.
E: aside
N: Divinci is losing his patience. He doesn't want to blow the whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel. The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on. So are the MEN in the line.
C: ONE OF THE MEN
D: Hey, come on, do it or don't!
C: THE VOICE
D: No talking.
N: Divinci leans in close to her. We can HEAR GRUMBLING from the men on the platform.
C: DIVINCI
D: Pick the asshole out!
N: Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels Divinci's hand grip her arm. He's had enough. Cynthia gets the message. And while keeping her eyes locked on Divinci she says --
C: CYNTHIA
D: Third man from the left.
N: JOE squints against the harsh light, trying to see into the room, as if he recognized the voice.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - OUTSIDE THE LINEUP ROOM -

C: CYNTHIA
D: I know him. He hangs around my building. He lives in the alley or something.
N: Rodriguez looks at Divinci. Is this a problem?
C: DIVINCI
D: You don't think people that hang around your neighborhood can kill somebody. Well let me tell you something. You don't live in a great fuckin' neighborhood.
N: Divinci pulls a paper from his pocket.
C: DIVINCI
D: Just sign the goddamn paper.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What paper?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: You picked a man out of a lineup, you have to sign that you did that so they don't think we made it up.
N: Cynthia just stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then --
C: CYNTHIA
D: Now why the hell would they think something like that?
C: DIVINCI
D: Sign it.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You said all I had to do was pick him out.
C: DIVINCI
D: This is part of it. Just sign it and you're done.

D: He didn't do it.
C: DIVINCI
D: How the hell d'you know that? Were you with him at the time?! You have a good goddamn alibi for him?!
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Maybe she was blowing him!
C: CYNTHIA
D: Better him than you.
N: Rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall. Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching.
C: DIVINCI
D: Take it easy.
N: Rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at Divinci.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Fine, I got nothin' at stake here.
N: Divinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to Cynthia.
C: DIVINCI
D: This is what they call an open and shut case. He did the kill and he's going down. Don't make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do.
N: Divinci holds out the paper. Cynthia hesitates a beat, then takes it and signs her name.

D: Doe?
N: Simms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci. Capt. Henderson and TWO OTHER DEA AGENTS (HOOPER and SARKASIAN) are also present. The DEA are in suits and ties.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: He wouldn't give us his last name.
C: SIMMS
D: He signed a confession but he wouldn't give you his last name?
C: DIVINCI
D: He said he couldn't remember it. He's a head case.

D: You run prints?

D: No priors.
C: AGENT SARKASIAN
D: Ballistics match?

C: AGENT HOOPER
D: It went down pretty quick.
C: DIVINCI
D: It's our street.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: I think they did a helluva job.
N: Suddenly Simms slams his hand down on the desk.
C: SIMMS
D: Goddammit!
N: Everyone turns to Simms. He's angry. Rodriguez is uneasy.
C: SIMMS
D: Some goddamn piece a shit blows him away for NOTHING!
N: The intensity of Simms anger quiets everybody. A beat as Simms regains his composure.
C: SIMMS
D: I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for this to happen... I just didn't think he'd go down this way.
N: Simms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez.
C: SIMMS
D: Good work. Thanks.
N: He shakes their hands. Then exits. Hooper and Sarkasian follow their boss out the door. Rodriguez, Divinci and Henderson exchange a look.
C: CAPT. HENDERSON
D: Do me a favor. Make sure this one sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes back in here.
T: CUT TO:
N: HEADLIGHTS (B&W) coming right at us. Closer and closer. Filling the screen. FLAMES BURST (COLOR) from the barrel of a .44 in SLOW MOTION -- a FIREBALL. The GUNSHOT is deafening, like thunder. GLASS SHATTERS in SLOW MOTION. JOE covers his face with his hands to protect himself from the glass. But there is no glass. Joe is sweating, detoxing. Wild eyed. He looks through his fingers, but there is no street, no dead man. Just the BARS of his CELL.

E: no response no response
C: ELLIOT
D: Word is everyone's entitled to a defense... no matter how guilty they are.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY
N: Court is in session. Old metropolitan courthouse. The PROSECUTOR and his TEAM are at one table. The DEFENSE ATTORNEY and his CLIENT are at the other. The Prosecutor is a woman. Her name is HELEN EDEN. She is thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN is her second in command. Richard is thirty-three. The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the portly side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER. But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our attention. His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look like a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel. He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a surprise. We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN, JUDGE WEINBERG.
C: HELEN
D: -- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, entered the house of George and Carol Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber pistol in his hand. He entered the house with one thing in mind. To kill George and Carol, the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.
N: The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and DIVINCI. Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now, walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's what he's thinking. He mouths "You die." Divinci mouths back. "Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead." Then he smiles. Clyde boils.
C: HELEN
D: George and Carol were watching a movie when he entered the living room and opened fire. George was killed instantly, hit in the face. Carol died later of three bullet wounds to her chest.
N: John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention to Helen. Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from Divinci.
C: HELEN
D: Then the defendant, in his effort to cover up the crime, doused them with lighter fluid and set the house on fire... Carol was still alive.
N: A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He tries his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's statement.
C: HELEN
D: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we will prove to you, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.
N: Helen looks at the jury for a beat, then returns to her table.
C: JUDGE WEINBERG
D: The defense may now proceed.
N: John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case. But our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a tense whisper.
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: -- Jesus Christ!
C: YOUNG MAN
D: -- I don't know where?
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: Are you sure?
C: YOUNG MAN
D: They looked all over --
C: HELEN
D: What's wrong?
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: They can't find the murder weapon.
C: HELEN
D: What're you talking about?
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: Dunner's .44. They can't find the goddamn gun!
C: YOUNG MAN
D: They lost it or something. Misplaced it, I don't know. They can't find it anywhere.
C: HELEN
D: What?!
E: no whisper this time
N: A pause in the court. The judge taps his gavel in anger as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Rodriguez, Divinci, Richard Stein, the young man and Helen. Helen is furious.
C: HELEN
D: -- I don't have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun. His fingerprints, the ballistics, everything! I have to have the fucking gun or he's gonna walk. That murdering piece of filth will go free without the .44. How could they lose it?!
N: Rodriguez and Divinci exchange a look.
T: CUT TO:
S: RODRIGUEZ AND DIVINCI - EXT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: walking quickly down the steps.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: The Dunner gun, you used the fucking Dunner gun?!
C: DIVINCI
D: This is not my fuck up! Our shooting was supposed to be gang-related and unsolved! Only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence! Otherwise, we never woulda needed it. So don't point your finger at me!
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Alright, alright... But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?!
C: DIVINCI
D: We don't explain it. It's not our fault they lost the evidence. Ballistics are already complete in Dunner's case. All we need is another gun.
T: CUT TO:
N: BRIEFCASE - ALLEY - DAY as it opens, revealing a DOZEN different HANDGUNS.
C: THE GUN SELLER
D: All my merchandise is in top condition. Untraceable. The best money can buy.
N: A BLACK MAN in a three piece suit, picks up the .44 with a GLOVED HAND. His accent is British.
C: THE GUN SELLER
D: It's got good knock down, but it's slow. Unless you have a preference for revolvers, I suggest a nine millimeter auto. They are more expensive, but what they cost in money, they save in time.
N: Rodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun.
C: DIVINCI
D: The .44.
N: The gun seller eyes them for a moment.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: What?
C: THE GUN SELLER
D: You look like police.
N: Divinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller. Then he smiles.
C: THE GUN SELLER

S: INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
N: Elliot is waiting, sitting at a table, staring at papers in his open briefcase. Door opens and a GUARD leads Joe into the room. Joe looks better, for the first time. His hair is combed. And he's clean. He wears jail blues. But he is a little gaunt. And tired. Elliot stands. The guard shuts the door, leaving them alone.
C: ELLIOT
D: Joe, I'm Elliot, we met the other... well, you weren't in very good shape. You look much better.
N: Joe just stares at Elliot.
C: ELLIOT
D: Have a chair. We need to talk.
C: WILLIAM
D: About what I did.
C: ELLIOT
D: Yes.
N: Joe crosses to the table and takes a chair opposite Elliot.
C: ELLIOT
D: Joe, before we get into what happened that night, I'd like to check a couple of things first. Joe is your first name, I assume Joseph?
E: looks at papers
C: WILLIAM
D: Okay.
N: Okay? Not the answer Elliot was looking for.
C: ELLIOT
D: What about Doe? Is that what you told the officers your last name was?
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't think so.
C: ELLIOT
D: What did you tell them your last name was?
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't remember.
C: ELLIOT
D: Well, is Doe your last name?
C: WILLIAM
D: I'm not sure.
N: Elliot stares at Joe. This is going to be a little more difficult than he thought.
C: ELLIOT
D: Do you know what your last name is?
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't remember.
C: ELLIOT
D: Joe, I'm your attorney, I'm here to help you. It doesn't matter if you give the court your last name or not, they will still put you on trial. Do you understand?
C: WILLIAM
D: Yes.
C: ELLIOT
D: So there's no reason to try and hide your identity. What is your last name?
E: Joe nods
C: WILLIAM
D: I would tell you if I could remember.
C: ELLIOT
D: Joe Smith, Joe Jones, Joe DiMaggio...
N: Elliot hopes he can trigger a response. Joe tries hard.
C: WILLIAM
D: ...I don't think so.
C: ELLIOT
D: Okay. Look, we'll move on. You understand the charges against you. They're serious. And if you are found guilty, you could go to prison for a very long time.
C: WILLIAM
D: Maybe I should.
C: ELLIOT
D: What?
C: WILLIAM
D: Go to prison. I killed him. I didn't mean to. But he was going to hit me.
C: ELLIOT
D: Yes, I know, I read your confession. Joe, if you really felt your life was in danger, we might be able to use self-defense as our argument. But before we get into that... Do you have any family, Joe? Any friends?
C: WILLIAM
D: I don't think so.
C: ELLIOT
D: Joe... do you know what a psychiatrist is?
C: WILLIAM
D: Yes.
C: ELLIOT
D: Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?
C: WILLIAM
D: ...I'm not sure.
C: ELLIOT
D: Joe, you don't remember much about yourself.
C: WILLIAM
D: No.
C: ELLIOT
D: ...but you remember the night you shot the man in the car.
C: WILLIAM
D: Yes.
C: ELLIOT
D: Why?
C: WILLIAM
D: ...because... I can... I'm sorry, I'm not much help.

S: INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY
N: The trial of Clyde D. Dunner in progress. Prosecution team at their table. Defense team at their table. JUDGE WEINBERG at the bench. Divinci on the stand. Clyde glaring at him. And Jury listening to Helen on the floor, prosecuting with vigor.
C: HELEN
D: -- and when you approached the suspect in his apartment, did you identify yourself as a police officer?
C: DIVINCI
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: Did the suspect respond?
C: DIVINCI
D: Yes, he did?
C: HELEN
D: In what way?
C: DIVINCI
D: He started shooting through the door.
C: HELEN
D: The Defendant fired six times, until his gun was empty. We would like to show you the weapon he used.
N: Helen crosses to the prosecution table, picks up the .44. She holds it up for the jury to see.
C: HELEN
D: And we would like to enter it into court records. It was the same Smith and Wesson revolver he used to viciously murder George and Carol Beaman.
N: The .44 is duly entered into the records. CLYDE glances at "his" .44 as it passes into the BAILIFF'S HANDS. It's a .44 all right.
C: HELEN
D: The prosecution would like to call Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand.
C: BAILIFF
D: Steven J. Allen.
N: STEVEN J. ALLEN, a short balding bespectacled man in his fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in, then sits.
C: HELEN
D: Mr. Allen, would tell the court what you do.
C: STEVEN J. ALLEN
D: I am a lab technician for the police department. One of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes.
N: Clyde's attention is on Helen's LEGS. He's bored by the proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him. He looks at -- THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON -- on the evidence table. There is no BLACK STAIN on the handle.
C: STEVEN J. ALLEN
D: I tested the defendant's revolver and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the deceased.
C: CLYDE
D: That ain't my gun.
N: All attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge, the jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement.
C: JUDGE WEINBERG
D: I must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when --
C: CLYDE
D: That ain't my gun!
N: The Judge taps her gavel. John Oblinger puts a hand on Clyde's arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very fast.
C: CLYDE
D: THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!
N: And Clyde is moving toward the gun. And the Bailiff and GUARDS are moving toward Clyde. And Helen is moving out of the way. And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel. And the jury is scared.
C: CLYDE
D: YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME!
N: Clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for Clyde. Clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks lose.

C: DIVINCI
D: We can't put the right gun back! Without that gun, they won't convict Joe.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Without that gun they won't convict Clyde!
C: DIVINCI
D: I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm worried about us!
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Look, Joe's never goin' to trial, right. He signed a goddamn confession! Like you said, this one is open and shut. Clyde's the one we gotta worry about. We can't let him go back on the street! He's a fuckin' psychopath. He'll kill somebody again.
C: DIVINCI
D: Shit. How the hell did that piece of puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun?! I don't think he knows his own fuckin' mother, but he knows his fuckin' gun!

C: DIVINCI
D: What d'you mean you can't do it? I gotta check something.
C: DESK OFFICER
D: You gotta get written permission from the Chief.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Since when?!
C: DESK OFFICER
D: Since an hour ago when he came down here and chewed me a new asshole bigger than a three car garage.
C: DIVINCI
D: What's the problem?
C: DESK OFFICER
D: Something about missing evidence or who the hell knows. I just wanna transfer the hell outa here.

S: INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY
N: Joe's preliminary trial. Joe is seated at the defense table with Elliot. ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is behind the bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to determine if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail. Elliot is shuffling papers in preparation for his opening. And at the prosecution table is a very tired Helen. She looks completely pissed off and worn out. In no mood for anything to go wrong.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Whenever you're ready.
N: Elliot stands.
C: ELLIOT
D: We would like to plead not guilty to the charge of murder at this time for reason of Insanity.
N: Helen gives Elliot a look. She doesn't need this.
C: WILLIAM
D: But I did it.
N: Elliot turns to Joe.
C: ELLIOT
D: Yes, Joe. Let me handle this.
C: WILLIAM
D: But I signed the confession.
C: ELLIOT
D: Yes, Joe. Don't worry about it. I'm the attorney.
C: HELEN
D: Your honor, can we have a moment?
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Council may approach the bench.
N: Helen and Elliot cross to the bench.
C: HELEN
D: Your honor, my colleague's client admits to the killing. I don't see any reason to go through a trial when it's obvious he would like to plead guilty.
C: ELLIOT
D: I don't agree.
C: HELEN
D: If he wants to plead guilty, you have to let him plead guilty.
C: ELLIOT
D: Not if he's not of sound mind.
C: HELEN
D: Come on, Elliot!
C: ELLIOT
D: I think he's crazy. I know you think he's just putting it on, that's D.A. standard procedure, but I don't think he is. So, your honor, I'm standing by the not guilty because I believe he's incapable of making that judgment.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Have you had a psychiatrist look at him?
C: ELLIOT
D: Yes, your honor. I think you'll see that my diagnosis is not without warrant.
E: hands him papers
N: The judge hesitates, then looks at Joe. Joe is staring at him.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: I'll review the findings and make my decision tomorrow.

D: We're gonna get through it. No evidence problems on this one.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I hope not... I don't know, Frank, lately I been thinkin'... maybe what we did wasn't such a good idea.
C: DIVINCI
D: Hey, we took out a few scumbags, that's it. Nobody's ever gonna miss those shitheels. They were all pieces of garbage. Not one of 'em had a sheet less than a mile long. Drugs, extortion, assault. They were all fuckin' guilty as hell and still on the street, you know that.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Except the cop.
C: DIVINCI
D: Yeah, except the cop. That's part of the job. Could just as easily have happened to you or me.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: But we're cops, you know? We fucked up.
C: DIVINCI

C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I know.

D: Look, if we got paid a decent salary we wouldn't be tempted by this, right? And what happens when we retire? You think our pension's gonna take care of us? Shit no. We are on our own. I mean all I want in life is a goddamn fishing boat, a beach, a couple drinks and some Hawaiian fuckin' music. That ain't much for twenty years putting murdering assholes behind bars. I mean, the dealers, the pimps, the killers, they got no rules. We got all the fuckin' rules. It ain't fair. That's all I'm sayin', it ain't fair... For awhile, we made it fair.
N: Rodriguez downs his scotch.
C: DIVINCI
D: Quit thinkin' you're a bad guy. You're not a fuckin' bad guy. You made one mistake. Let it go.
N: Rodriguez nods. A WAITRESS comes to the table. Rodriguez orders another. The Waitress leaves. Rodriguez hesitates a moment, then --
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Do you think we're corrupt?
C: DIVINCI
D: Hey, I never took a fuckin' bribe in my life.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Me either.
C: DIVINCI
D: Nobody ever bought me.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I know.
C: DIVINCI
D: No fuckin' way. Even the thought makes me sick. And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt. It's two completely different things. Don't get 'em confused.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I guess you're right.
C: DIVINCI
D: I'm telling you. It's nothin' to do with corrupt.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: I'm worried, that's all.
C: DIVINCI
D: Hey, you gotta worry a little. It's natural. Just don't lose your sense of humor.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: My sense of humor, right.
C: DIVINCI
D: The problem with people is, nobody gives a shit about makin' the world a better place. You and me, I don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place. No matter what happens. There are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us. They're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison. They were garbage. And there's nothin' wrong with takin' out the garbage.
N: Divinci downs his scotch. Rodriguez nods, then --
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: So, you think you'll get back with Caroline?
C: DIVINCI
D: Shit. Nothin' I ever do is good enough, you know?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Never is, never was, never will be.
C: DIVINCI
D: Guess I gotta make the effort. It's gonna cost me if I don't.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Tell me about it. You know how much I got left.

N: Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, the reality of his statement taking a moment to fully slam home.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: They found him mentally unable to plead so his attorney pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.
C: DIVINCI
D: You gotta be kiddin' me.
C: RODRIGUEZ

C: SERGEANT GARDNER
D: Sorry to call so late, but I got a hysterical woman here says she needs to talk to you about a murder.
N: Divinci turns on the light revealing a WOMAN in bed with him. He picks up his watch, looks at the time.
C: SERGEANT GARDNER
D: I told her I couldn't call you at home, but she said that it was very important. A matter of, you know, life and death.
C: DIVINCI
D: What's her name?
C: SERGEANT GARDNER
D: Cynthia.
N: Divinci perks up at the name. And now we SEE Cynthia in the POLICE STATION trying not to look as freaked out as she feels. But she's not holding together well.

C: DIVINCI
D: SHUT UP!
N: He opens the driver's door, pushes her in. Gets in behind her.
S: INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT
N: Cynthia is a bundle of nerves. Divinci slams the door. Cynthia is startled by the suddenness of his anger.
C: DIVINCI
D: What're you talkin' about?
N: Cynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena.
C: CYNTHIA
D: They want me in court.
N: Divinci glances at the papers.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You promised me I wasn't gonna have to do anything! What the hell is goin' on?!
N: This is yet another glitch that Divinci hadn't counted on.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I can't do this, Frank. I can't go into court. I'm gettin' outa here!

C: DIVINCI
D: WELL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! NOW JUST FUCKIN' CALM DOWN FOR A SECOND AND LET ME THINK!
N: Cynthia glares at him, then turns away, takes a drag and blows out the smoke.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Fine. Think away.
N: Divinci hesitates as ANOTHER CAR pulls out. Then turns to her.
C: DIVINCI
D: Look, you're a witness, that's all. You got nothin' to worry about. You saw something happen --
C: CYNTHIA
D: -- What?! What did I see?!
C: DIVINCI
D: I will tell you everything you gotta know. You understand? Everything. You will know exactly what to say.
N: Cynthia looks at Divinci, unsure. Divinci gives her a confident smile. Look, it's another stage, that's all. Just like dancin'. THE UNMARKED CAR pulls quickly out of the PARKING GARAGE.

C: ELLIOT
D: Excuse me?
C: WILLIAM
D: I want to plead guilty. I killed a man and I should be punished.
C: ELLIOT
D: ...I'm a little surprised.
C: WILLIAM
D: Why?
C: ELLIOT
D: Nobody ever wants to be punished for what they've done. It's just a new concept. But I still think our defense is reasonable. I don't believe, under the condition you were in, that you were responsible for your actions.
C: WILLIAM
D: But why was I carrying a gun? I had no right to carry a gun.
C: ELLIOT
D: If you hadn't been carrying the gun, you might be dead.
C: WILLIAM

D: Shit, Frank, she's a goddamn stripper for Chrissake, who's gonna believe her. I don't believe her when she's telling the truth!
N: An OFFICER walks to the car and knocks on the window. Divinci rolls it down.

D: So?
C: OFFICER
D: I was just wondering if you were gonna be the primary on this one, that's all.

D: Yeah, yeah, we're comin'. Just give us some room.
N: Divinci rolls the window back up. The officer backs off.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: She could blow the whole thing. She could tie us in and that would be it. We'd be fuckin' fried.
C: DIVINCI
D: If it looks like she's gonna crumble we'll take steps.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: What steps?
N: Divinci looks at Rodriguez.

C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We just can't go around killin' everybody!
C: DIVINCI
D: Just a second. Look around. Whatta we got here? Two stiffs on the street, shot to shit, three more inside. That's five chalk lines in one night in one deal in one neighborhood in one city. Let me fill you in on some statistics, we're not killin' everybody. Look, this is strictly last resort. Okay? But let's not kid ourselves. If push comes to shove, somebody has to go down. If you got another candidate, I'm willin' to listen.

C: MANNY
D: -- I know what you fuckin' said, but you want me to find her I gotta know why the fuck she took off! So I know where not to look! Okay?!
C: DIVINCI
D: ...she's supposed to testify. She got scared, thinks somebody might kill her, so she's hidin'. That's why I want you to find her. If somebody is tryin' to pop her, I don't want anyone knowin' where she is. Manny eyes Divinci. He doesn't believe anything anybody tells him. Especially in his business.

N: Everyone turns to look at Joe (William McCall). CAMERA PUSHES in on him. It doesn't look as if he's sure who he is yet.
C: ARTHUR
D: I have represented the McCall family for several years before William McCall's disappearance seven years ago. It was assumed that he had died, but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances, I would ask this court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare adequately in light of his real identity now being known.

C: ARTHUR
D: One week should be sufficient.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Any objection to a week's continuance by the State?

C: DUNCAN
D: First trial, huh.
C: WILLIAM
D: Yes.
C: DUNCAN
D: I got one piece of advise. When you break for lunch, don't get the pastrami.
N: We HEAR the BARRED CELL DOOR open.
C: GUARD
D: Time to go.
N: Joe gets up. Puts out his hands. They shackle him as we HEAR --
C: THE BAILIFF'S VOICE
D: Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Joe is lead down the hall by TWO GUARDS, past rows of cells filled with other PRISONERS --
C: BAILIFF'S VOICE
D: The Criminal Court, Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding. Please be seated and come to order.
E: We HEAR people rise
S: EXT. COUNTY JAIL - PARKING AREA - DAY
N: Joe is lead to a waiting prison van. He gets inside.
C: BAILIFF'S VOICE

N: The van pulls away.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON (CLYDE'S .44) as it is introduced into evidence.
C: HELEN
D: -- when he pulled this gun and fired at the driver of the car. Killing him instantly. Let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four caliber handgun.
S: INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY
N: Joe is sitting at the Defense table with Arthur and Elliot. The trial is underway. And they watch the .44 go to the evidence table -- the .44 with the BLACK STAIN. Richard Stein is seated at the Defense table. He, too, is watching the .44. He leans across to his ASSISTANT.
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: All these goddamn guns are startin' to look the same to me.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: DIVINCI - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER
N: on the stand, being questioned by Helen.
C: HELEN
D: And when you arrested the defendant, did he deny that he had killed Agent Hudd.
C: DIVINCI
D: No.
C: HELEN
D: Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest.
C: DIVINCI
D: He was drunk. We could smell the booze on him. But we drew blood. He didn't object.
C: HELEN
D: We have the blood test report that shows -- -- that he had four times the legal limit to drive. The people would like to enter this into evidence.
E: picks up report
N: They so enter it.
T: CUT TO:
S: RODRIGUEZ - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER
N: on the stand. Elliot is cross-examining.
C: ELLIOT
D: -- and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing. What lead you to suspect Mr. McCall?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: You ask questions. Work the neighborhood. Find out who was on the street that night.
C: ELLIOT
D: Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He had no previous criminal record.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We found someone who'd seen him in the area. So we picked him up for questioning. We didn't expect it to be him. But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him. If he wasn't the killer, he might've seen the killer. Just routine really.
C: ELLIOT
D: Where did you find the defendant?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: On the street. Corner of Third and Madison.
C: ELLIOT
D: What was he doing?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: He was passed out.
C: ELLIOT
D: But you knew it was the man you were looking for.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Yes.
C: ELLIOT
D: Based on what?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: His description.
C: ELLIOT
D: Who provided you with the description?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Cynthia something, I think.
E: hesitates a beat
N: Elliot moves to the defense table, glances at Arthur as he picks up a paper. Arthur nods approvingly. Elliot looks at the paper.
C: ELLIOT
D: I believe her name is Cynthia Webb. According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line- up. The name familiar?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Yes... that's her.
C: ELLIOT
D: Where did you find Ms Webb?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: On the street. Same area.
C: ELLIOT
D: And she agreed to pick the defendant out of a line up.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Yes.
C: ELLIOT
D: Where you aware that Ms Webb disappeared after she was served with a subpoena?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Yes, my partner and I tried to contact her about the case and were unsuccessful.
C: ELLIOT
D: Thank you, Detective, that's all the questions I have.
N: Rodriguez gets up as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ETHNIC BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A waitress cruises past tables to the booth in the back. She sets down two scotch and waters to the two men. Rodriguez and Divinci. The waitress exits. Divinci picks up his glass.
C: DIVINCI
D: To justice in all its forms.
N: Rodriguez picks up his glass.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We're not home free yet.
C: DIVINCI
D: Without Ms Webb, there's no place they can go. We still got the confession, the gun, the ballistics... And I don't give a shit about all this African doctor crap... the man is a drunk and he's been a drunk for seven goddamn years. So lets have a drink for drunks.
N: Rodriguez reluctantly lifts his glass. They clink and drink.
C: DIVINCI
D: That's the thing about life. You control it or it controls you. Most people don't understand that. They try'n blame their fuck-ups on something or somebody else. But it's not like that. I don't wanna hear why your life's a mess. It's a mess cause you're a mess. That simple. They're waitin' to live happily ever after. But after what? After all the shit happens? Well, I got a clue for everybody, the shit never stops happening. So you deal with it or you get buried in it. I'm not talkin' about you, you know what I'm sayin' here.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Yeah.
C: DIVINCI
D: Life don't work in mysterious ways. There ain't no mystery to it. You just work it. And you don't take it too serious. You can't take it too serious otherwise you get fragile. And you can't be fragile and have any fuckin' fun.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: You think I'm fragile?
C: DIVINCI
D: That's the first sign of trouble, when you start askin' other people.
N: Rodriguez nods.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: ...I just wish I knew where the hell she was.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HELEN'S D.A. OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Helen and Richard Stein are working late. Over take-out Chinese.
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: -- so I think we'll have to rely on the confession for his description of what happened. He'll never take the stand, even if --
E: referring to papers
N: The phone rings. Richard picks up.
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: D.A.'s office... What?... When?... Where will --
E: into phone
N: Richard is surprised. He turns to Helen.
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: They found Cynthia Webb.
C: HELEN
D: Where?
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: I don't know.
C: HELEN
D: When?
C: RICHARD STEIN
D: I don't know.
C: HELEN
D: Well who the hell was that?
C: RICHARD STEIN

N: Richard hangs up the receiver. He and Helen exchange a look.
C: HELEN
D: What the fuck is going on?!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY
C: HELEN
D: Your honor, the people call Ms. Cynthia Webb to the stand.
N: VARIOUS REACTIONS Rodriguez and Divinci are stunned. Cynthia? Elliot is completely surprised. Cynthia? Arthur is never shaken by anything. The courtroom doors open and Cynthia is lead down the aisle by a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. She moves to the chair. But it's Joe's turn to double take. He remembers her. My God, he knows her. It's Cynthia -- the girl from the apartment building. He never saw who pointed him out, but he never expected it to be her.
C: BAILIFF
D: Raise your right hand.
N: Cynthia raises her hand. But her look goes right to Joe. Staring at him. She's never seen Joe like this -- cleaned up, trimmed, handsome. She's not sure she even recognizes him.
C: BAILIFF
D: You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God.
N: She turns her eyes from Joe.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Sure.
C: BAILIFF
D: You may be seated.
N: Cynthia sits down. Looks at Divinci. And Joe leans across to Arthur and Elliot. Their conversation is in whispers --
C: WILLIAM
D: I know her.
C: ELLIOT
D: She's the woman who identified you.
C: WILLIAM
D: No. I mean I know her.
C: ARTHUR
D: ...How?
C: WILLIAM
D: I'm not sure... I think I lived near her.
N: Arthur exchanges a look with Elliot. Arthur turns now and looks at Cynthia. The wheels are turning.
C: HELEN
D: Please state your name for the court.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Cynthia Webb.
C: HELEN
D: Do you see the man that you identified in a police line-up in this room.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall?
N: Cynthia looks at Joe. Joe looks straight at her. Cynthia turns her eyes away.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: HELEN
D: Please describe what you saw the night of September 14th.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I was comin' out of an all night minimart --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - MINI MART - NIGHT
N: Cynthia comes out of a ALL NIGHT MINI-MART with a bag of food. She walks down the street and suddenly we HEAR a GUNSHOT. Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the sound. And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man running. He has a pistol in one hand. Cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the darkness.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY
N: Cynthia is looking at Helen.
C: HELEN
D: And you're positive the man you saw with the gun is the defendant.
N: Instead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez and Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution table. They are looking right at her. They wait for her answer.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yeah.
C: HELEN
D: No further questions.
N: Divinci offers her a small smile. Cynthia turns away. Arthur is now standing in front of her.
C: ARTHUR
D: Miss Webb... is it Miss?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: ARTHUR
D: Miss Webb, had you ever seen the defendant before that night, the night you described to us?
C: CYNTHIA
D: No.
C: ARTHUR
D: Do you know what perjury is?
C: CYNTHIA
D: When you lie.
C: ARTHUR
D: When you lie under oath in a court of law. Do you know what the penalty for that is?
C: CYNTHIA
D: You go to jail.
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes... Cynthia, have you ever seen the defendant before that night?
C: HELEN
D: Objection. The witness has already answered that question.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Sustained.
C: ARTHUR
D: I just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else before the night in question.
N: Divinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give the answer he wants her to give.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Ms. Webb, do you understand the consequences of perjury?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Let's get on with it then.
C: ARTHUR
D: What did you buy the night you went into the mini-mart?
C: CYNTHIA
D: What did I buy?
C: ARTHUR
D: You remembered seeing Mr. McCall that night and hearing the gunshot and a car crash. I just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini-mart.
C: CYNTHIA
D: ...shampoo I think.
C: ARTHUR
D: That's all?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: ARTHUR
D: Where do you live?
C: CYNTHIA
D: 4356 17th Street. Number 37.
C: ARTHUR
D: Is that close to where this mini- mart is?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Close? Sort of.
C: ARTHUR
D: How far would you say?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't really know.
C: ARTHUR
D: Within walking distance?
C: CYNTHIA
D: No... I don't think so.
C: ARTHUR
D: Did you walk there that night or drive?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I ahh... drove.
C: ARTHUR
D: You drove. But when you left the mini-mart you stated that you walked down the street.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yeah.
C: ARTHUR
D: How far?
C: CYNTHIA
D: ...to the corner.
C: HELEN
D: Objection. Your honor, I don't see a point to this line of questioning.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Is there a point?
C: ARTHUR
D: Yes, your honor. Since this is the only witness, I'm trying to establish what the scene was like that night.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Try to get there as quickly as possible.
C: ARTHUR
D: And how far away from the corner was the Mini-mart? For example was it in the middle of the block, close to the corner, where?
E: to Cynthia
C: CYNTHIA
D: In the middle I think.
C: ARTHUR
D: So you walked all the way to the corner. I assume then you were walking back to your car, yes?
C: CYNTHIA
D: ...yeah.
C: ARTHUR
D: Was there a reason you parked so far away?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Um... there were lots of cars parked on the street.
E: getting nervous
C: ARTHUR
D: Was there anyone else on the street besides you?
C: CYNTHIA
D: No.
C: ARTHUR
D: Lots of cars, but no people. Any traffic?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't remember.
C: ARTHUR
D: So you were the only person to see Joe on the street that night?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I didn't see anybody else.
C: ARTHUR
D: So you heard a gunshot, a car crash and a man running with a gun in his hand.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: ARTHUR
D: What did you do then? Did you call the police, 911?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I went home.
C: ARTHUR
D: You went home. Straight home?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: ARTHUR
D: And you're sure it was Joe you saw that night?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
C: ARTHUR
D: When you went home.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes.
N: Arthur pauses.
C: ARTHUR
D: When you went home you saw Joe?
N: Cynthia realizes what she's said.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No.
C: HELEN
D: Objection. Defense is trying to confuse the witness.
C: ARTHUR
D: I'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn't that right, Ms Webb?
N: Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared.
C: HELEN
D: Objection!
N: Everyone's attention is on Cynthia.
C: ARTHUR
D: When I referred to him as Joe, you knew who I was talking about, didn't you. This case is the People versus Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has never been mentioned in this trial. How did you know who I was talking about, Ms. Webb?
N: Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is frozen. Rodriguez is sweating. Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe. Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating her.
C: ARTHUR
D: Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe was the defendant?
N: Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor.
C: CYNTHIA
D: He lived in the alley next to my apartment building.
N: Helen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again.
C: HELEN
D: Oh shit.
E: to herself
N: Divinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool, calm and collected.
C: ARTHUR
D: Why did you lie to this court?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't know.
C: ARTHUR
D: Are you afraid of somebody?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't know.
C: ARTHUR
D: Are you protecting somebody?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't know.
C: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
D: Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or I'll be forced to cite you for contempt.
N: Cynthia looks up at the judge. She's not talking.

D: I know she'll talk.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: We'll make it look gang related.
C: DIVINCI
D: Problem is we're gonna need another gun.

D: The problem?! Have you forgotten? She's in fucking jail. That's the goddamn problem.

D: Everything's fine, Manny. I just came to apologize. We need some privacy...
E: looks at secretary
N: Manny looks at Divinci, then motions for his Secretary to take a walk. She gets up, exits.
C: DIVINCI
D: Just one more favor. I want you to bail somebody out of jail.
C: MANNY
D: You're kiddin'.
C: DIVINCI
D: Bail's twenty-five thousand.
N: Divinci pulls out a piece of paper.
C: DIVINCI
D: I want her out tonight. And don't tell her who. It's a surprise.
C: MANNY
D: And how'm I payin' for this? They don't take American Express.
N: Divinci pulls a plastic bag filled with cocaine out of his pocket -- tosses it onto Manny's desk.
C: DIVINCI
D: I know you know how to exchange that. It's worth a lot more than twenty- five grand. You can keep the change. I want her back in two hours... Or I'll nail you for possession.
E: points to cocaine

C: DUNCAN
D: No shit, no shit, really. A surgeon. I know I'm nobody to judge, but you musta been a smart guy. What the hell's a smart guy like you doin' in here?
N: Joe looks up at Duncan, hesitates, then --
C: WILLIAM
D: ...I had an affair with another woman... a nurse at the hospital I worked at. It was nothing... I can't even remember much about her... Except my wife found out. We had a fight. She left the house, took the kids... She was hysterical. I should've done something... gone after them, I don't know... they were killed in a car accident about a mile from the house... I've never told anybody that... about why she left.

D: Are you kidding? We're going to kill a goddamn witness who's in fucking jail because we killed an undercover DEA agent. I'm sorry, but this kinda shit troubles me a little.

D: Take off the dress and get back in the game. We gotta do what we gotta do.

C: CYNTHIA
D: Was it a cop?
C: MANNY
D: Yeah, right. Cops bail people outa jail all the time. Doesn't there seem to be a dichotomy there for you?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't like this.
C: MANNY
D: You wanna stay in jail, that's up to you. Or you come with me.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What'd he look like?
C: MANNY
D: You're a stripper right? Lotta guys fall in love with your type. But they don't know how to get close, know what I mean? Somebody wants you to owe them something. Take it or leave it.

C: RODRIGUEZ
D: It was all okay until you shot Hudd.
C: DIVINCI
D: What's goin' on here? You mad at me or something?
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: It wasn't my idea to start killing people, Frank. That's all I'm sayin'. We're in this goddamn mess because you started killing people.
C: DIVINCI
D: Drug dealers don't qualify as people. Never did, never will. So what the hell's wrong with you tonight? You suddenly worried about where all the money went?

C: DIVINCI
D: YOU FUCKIN' RAT!
N: Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head. Rodriguez, bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank.
C: RODRIGUEZ
D: Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything.
N: Divinci pulls back the hammer, ready to blow Rodriguez' head off.

D: Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!
N: Divinci is ready to pull the trigger.

He stares at the broken recorder.

N: Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles Vic. But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the explosion of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A moment of silence then --
C: VIC
D: Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin' shot him!
N: Two men stumble to the door. Leaving one on the floor. The door is flung open and Vic runs out. Followed by Cutless Supreme.
T: CUT TO:
S: CRIME SCENE TAPE - INT. RODRIGUEZ APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
N: The crime scene is swarming with cops, DEA and FBI. The task of evidence collection in progress. Rodriguez' body on the floor. Agent Simms is standing over the body with Agent Sarkasian.
C: AGENT SARKASIAN
D: Divinci musta figured it. I didn't think he'd kill his own partner though.
C: SIMMS
D: He's an animal.
N: DEA AGENT Hooper comes up behind Simms.
C: AGENT HOOPER
D: Recorders busted up. But we might be able to salvage some of the tape.
C: SIMMS
D: I want him. You understand me, I don't care what it takes. I want that sonuvabitch!
N: Simms heads for the door. Sarkasian and Hooper follow.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - MORNING
N: A car pulls up in front.
S: INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - MORNING
N: It is deadly quiet. We PAN SLOWLY around the office until we find Manny in his chair, sprawled back. Continuing to PAN until we see Cynthia sprawled on the couch. But no signs of blood. Just the bodies. The door opens. TWO MEN enters. All we SEE are GUNS in hands. Cynthia and Manny wake up with a start. Manny is scared.
C: MANNY
D: Shit! Who the fuck're you?!
N: A BADGE comes out. And now we see Agents Hooper and Sarkasian.
C: AGENT SARKASIAN
D: Ms. Webb. We'd like you to come with us.
N: Cynthia looks at Manny. She's pissed.
C: CYNTHIA
D: This was the big secret? Shit. You're an asshole.
N: Cynthia puts her coat on and heads for the door. Manny doesn't know what the hell is going on.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - FEDERAL BLDG. - DAY
N: Cynthia is in with Agents Simms, Hooper and Sarkasian.
C: SIMMS
D: Who set it up?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't know.
C: AGENT HOOPER
D: It was Divinci wasn't it?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't know.
C: SIMMS
D: Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci or Rodriguez?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't know.
N: Agent Simms looks right into Cynthia's eyes.
C: SIMMS
D: Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was shot in the head last night.
N: This gets Cynthia's attention.
C: SIMMS
D: Rodriguez was wearing a recorder. Divinci found it. You can do addition, can't you.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You're full of shit.
C: AGENT SARKASIAN
D: Just tell us what you know.
N: Cynthia looks at both of them.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Where's Divinci?
C: SIMMS
D: We don't know. But we're gonna find him.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You're gonna find him? Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing.
E: smiles sarcastically
N: Simms stares at her for a moment, then turns to Hooper and nods. Hooper takes Cynthia's arm and leads her out of the office. When the door closes --
C: SIMMS
D: Get a copy of the tape to Bailor. But make sure it doesn't come from us.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - DAY
N: Cynthia is alone in her cell. We HEAR footsteps. She looks up as the GUARD approaches.
C: GUARD
D: Your attorney's here.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What attorney?
S: INT. ROOM - COUNTY JAIL - DAY
N: Cynthia enters the office. The Guard shuts the door. Cynthia finds herself facing Arthur Baylor. A tape recorder on the table in front of him.
C: ARTHUR
D: Hi, Cynthia. Please sit down.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I got nothin' to say.
C: ARTHUR
D: So I'm told.
N: Arthur pushes the tape recorder and we HEAR --
C: DIVINCI'S VOICE
D: ...Take off your shirt...
C: RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
D: Fuck you, you don't trust me.
C: DIVINCI'S VOICE
D: I'm askin' you one more time.
C: RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
D: You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.
C: DIVINCI'S VOICE
D: Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget it. This thing... shit. Let's just get it over with. I'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead. Then we're off the hook.
N: Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." But Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything. And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal what she's really feeling and thinking.
C: RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
D: Right.
C: DIVINCI'S VOICE
D: YOU FUCKIN' RAT!
C: RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
D: Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you... Simms knows everything. Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!
C: DIVINCI'S VOICE
D: You're fuckin' right.
N: The recording ends. Arthur shuts off the machine.
C: ARTHUR
D: I think you know my client is innocent. That's all I care about, my client. But I understand why you're scared. You're already facing perjury charges. My guess is, your involvement is deeper than that. But I don't really care, I'm not after you... I get nothing if you go to jail. But I think if I help you, I can help my client.
C: CYNTHIA
D: ...how?
C: ARTHUR
D: William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did he?
N: Cynthia hesitates, then shakes her head.
C: ARTHUR
D: Why don't you sit down.
N: A beat, then Cynthia pulls up a chair.
T: CUT TO:
S: AGENT SIMMS - INT. OFFICE - DAY
N: angry.
C: SIMMS
D: No goddamn way! I'm not going to grant that whore immunity. She lied on the stand, she's protecting somebody. And she's involved. I want them all.
N: Arthur, who was sitting across from him, stands.
C: ARTHUR
D: Before I leave, let me remind you that you have shit for a case. If you really care about seeing justice for your dead agent, don't blow this deal. Immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop. It's the only way she's going to talk.
N: Simms glares at Arthur.
C: ARTHUR
D: And William McCall walks, right now, all charges dropped.
N: Simms hesitates, then --
C: SIMMS
D: If what she says is any good, I'll deal. If it isn't, then nobody goes anywhere.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - DAY
N: Cynthia is lead down the hall by GUARDS. They enter an office.
S: INT. OFFICE - CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - DAY
N: Agents Simms, Hooker, Sarkasian and TWO TECHNICIANS are waiting inside with Arthur. Cynthia is lead into the room. The guards withdraw, closing the door. Cynthia looks at the men, then at the TAPE RECORDING EQUIPMENT on the table and the empty chair. A MICROPHONE is waiting. Cynthia looks at Arthur, then sits down in the chair.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - DAY
N: REPORTERS swarm around Arthur and Joe as they exit the courthouse.
C: REPORTERS
D: How does it feel to be a free man again?
N: Arthur and Joe head down the steps to a waiting LIMOUSINE.
C: REPORTERS
D: Do you remember everything that happened to you? What are your plans?
C: WILLIAM
D: I just want to go back to work.
C: REPORTERS
D: As a surgeon?
C: WILLIAM
D: Yes.
C: REPORTERS
D: What about the signed confession, did the police coerce you into signing it?
C: ARTHUR
D: I'm sorry, no more questions.
N: They get into the back of the waiting limo and it pulls away.
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
N: Nathan is in the back, staring at Joe. Arthur sits next to Joe. Nathan smiles. Joe smiles.
C: NATHAN
D: Good to have you back, Will.
C: WILLIAM
D: ...I'd like to make one stop.
C: NATHAN
D: I know.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
N: The limousine is parked curbside. Nathan and Arthur wait. Watching Joe walk across the lawn. He stops, looking down. The grave stones are for his wife and two children. He sits down beside them. It's very near where Agent Hudd was buried.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE MCCALL MANSION - DUSK
N: Giant party in progress. Expensive cars parked along the drive.
S: INT. MCCALL MANSION - DUSK
N: Filled with well-wishers in TUXES and GOWNS. Arthur Bailor and Elliot in attendance. Elliot isn't used to this much glory, but he's taking credit where where he can -- with one of the PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN.
C: ELLIOT
D: -- you know, it just didn't make sense, a man wanting to be punished for a crime? How many times does that happen? Once in a lifetime, I can tell you.
N: CAMERA MOVES to Arthur, who is also receiving his share of the credit.
C: ARTHUR
D: -- to tell the truth, I had no other witnesses to refute her testimony. But she didn't know that. All we knew was that she was reluctant to testify. You look for signs.
N: And CAMERA CONTINUES TO Joe and Nathan.
C: A MAN
D: My God, we thought you were dead, you know. It's just incredible that you're here.
C: A WOMAN
D: Life moves in such strange ways. Oh, I just think what might've happened to you had you not been arrested for killing that poor policeman. You still might be on the street.
N: Joe just takes it all in, smiling and nodding.
C: ANOTHER WOMAN
D: Joe, you look wonderful. After what you've been through... I just can't imagine.
C: ANOTHER MAN
D: When you're ready to come back to work, let me know. I've already spoken to the board, they're ready to re- certify you anytime. I can put you in the emergency sector until you get warmed up. We all want you back. We can't afford to waste someone of your talent.
E: SINCLAIR
N: A beat, then Joe smiles.
C: WILLIAM
D: ...I'm ready.
N: A BLACK TUXEDO WIPES past CAMERA as we --
T: CUT TO:
N: BLACK SCREEN. We HEAR the POUNDING of the MUSIC -- a FAMILIAR RHYTHM. And in GRAFFITI across the screen: FOUR MONTHS LATER
S: EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
N: The neon blares as usual.
S: INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
N: And there's Cynthia. Back bumping and grinding to the music. He life hasn't changed at all. And she knows it. But there's nothing else she can do.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)
N: Door opens. Cynthia enters. Shuts the door. Tries the light. It doesn't go on. Suddenly a man is next to her --
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: I guess you had no choice.
E: DIVINCI
N: Cynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm. And now we see Divinci. He looks like hell. A man on the run. Desperate and dangerous. He hasn't shaved. His clothes are filthy. He looks like... Joe. Cynthia looks up at him.
C: DIVINCI
D: You had to do the right thing.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What d'you want?
C: DIVINCI
D: What do I want?
N: Divinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room.
C: DIVINCI
D: Why're you asking me that? You gonna grant me three wishes? I don't know where to start. Let's see... money would be nice... love would be better... but a little loyalty... you can never get enough of that. ...But we'll start with... money.
E: moves up to her
N: Divinci pushes her into the bedroom.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)
N: Cynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it. It's got her savings.
C: CYNTHIA
D: This is all I've got.
N: Divinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket pocket.
C: CYNTHIA
D: They'll catch you.
C: DIVINCI
D: I don't think so.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You wanna bet?
C: DIVINCI
D: They don't have a clue, baby. And you wanna know why? Because I am following my heart.
N: Divinci puts aside his gun. And pushes Cynthia down on the bed. He leans in close to her. Face to face.
C: DIVINCI
D: And they don't know where that is.
C: CYNTHIA
D: So tell me about your plans. I think I'd like to hear 'em now.
N: Divinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with remorse.
C: DIVINCI
D: Loyalty is what it all comes down to. Nothing holds together when it's gone. And once it's gone, you don't ever get it back... You shouldn't've told 'em.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I shouldn't've done a lotta things in my life. But that's not one of 'em.
C: DIVINCI
D: Let me tell you something... the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he's doing.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)
N: It is dark and quiet. No clue as to what's going on inside. And we hold on this for a long moment. Just wondering what's she being made to do. And then there's a MUFFLED BOOM. Divinci exits the bedroom quickly. He is upset. We HEAR the DOOR close. AND WHITE FEATHERS fall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across the bed. The pillow on the floor beside her with the stuffing blown out. She has a hole in her chest, right above her heart.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - EARLY MORNING
N: Manny unlocks the door, enters his office.
C: DIVINCI'S VOICE
D: Shut the door and lock it.
C: MANNY
D: Jesus Christ!
N: Manny looks toward the voice. Divinci is sitting on the floor out of sight. Holding his revolver.
C: MANNY
D: You scared the shit outa me.
C: DIVINCI
D: Lock the door.
N: Manny locks the door.
C: DIVINCI
D: One more favor, Manny.
C: MANNY
D: Since when did I become such a good guy?
C: DIVINCI
D: I'm takin' some time off. I want a car, here tonight, and a driver. You can do that for your old friend, right?
C: MANNY
D: Yeah, I can do that. But you are a hot fuckin' potato. And drivers that don't talk, don't come cheap.
E: disgusted
C: DIVINCI
D: I got the money. Just put it together.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING
N: An AMBULANCE races up to the EMERGENCY entrance.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING
N: TWO PARAMEDICS push the gurney down the hall. Cynthia is conscious on the gurney. Looking up at the ceiling. She is fading. We HEAR --
C: VOICES
D: -- come on, hang in there, hold on.
N: CYNTHIA'S (MOVING) P.O.V OF THE CEILING and FACES. The gurney pushes past and CAMERA PICKS UP TWO SURGEONS moving out of an Operating Room. Pulling off masks and rubber gloves bloody from surgery. One of them is Joe. The other surgeon pats him on the back.
C: OTHER SURGEON
D: Just like riding a bike.
N: Joe finally breathes a sigh of relief and manages a smile.
T: CUT TO:
S: BLACK LINCOLN - EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT
N: pulls up in front of the office. Tinted windows.
S: INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Manny is looking out the window.
C: MANNY
D: Leather upholstery, moon roof, CD. What more could you ask for?
N: Divinci looks out. Gun in hand. He's cleaned himself up. He's now wearing a Hawaiian shirt, slacks. A traveler.
C: DIVINCI
D: Better not be a set up.
C: MANNY
D: Want me to hold your hand?
C: DIVINCI
D: Just walk me to the door.
S: EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT
N: The Lincoln idles at the curb. Divinci and Manny exit the office. Divinci glances up and down the street as they move toward the car. Manny opens the back door. Nobody inside.
C: DIVINCI
D: I think I'll let you live.
C: MANNY
D: You are a real prince. Now how about my money?
N: Divinci hands Manny a wad of cash from his pocket, then gets into the back of the car.
C: DIVINCI
D: You never saw me.
C: MANNY
D: Don't I wish that were true.
N: He closes the door. The Lincoln pulls away. Manny watches it move off down the street.
C: MANNY
D: Have a nice trip.
S: INT. LINCOLN - NIGHT
N: Driving. Divinci in the back. Can only see the DRIVER'S EYES in the REAR VIEW MIRROR.
C: DIVINCI
D: Head south. Get on the interstate. Don't break the speed limit.
N: Divinci settles into the leather seat. Looks at the rear view mirror.
C: DIVINCI
D: You know, the one thing about life... you can never lose your sense of humor. Without it, you got nothin'.
N: Suddenly the driver turns around, holding a 9mm and fires. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Divinci's head snaps back as the BACK WINDOW BLOWS OUT of the Lincoln. And now we recognize the driver. It's Clyle D. Dunner.
C: CLYDE
D: Fuckin' A.
N: THE LINCOLN moves right into CAMERA. BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS filling the screen. The car stops. We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and RUNNING FEET. And PAN INTO THE BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS GLARING into CAMERA.
T: CUT TO:
S: SURGICAL LIGHTS - INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
N: SHINING BRIGHTLY into CAMERA.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: -- run the cardioplegia.
N: Faces appear. Looking down. We recognize Joe and one of the friends from the party -- Sinclair.
C: WILLIAM
D: She's fibrilating. Go on bypass.
N: Faces move away as we HEAR MEDICAL MACHINES in operation. A NURSE reappears. CAMERA MOVES back now, revealing the room. And the operation in progress.
C: SURGEON SINCLAIR
D: Forceps. Just like old times.
E: A nurse hands him forceps
C: WILLIAM
D: I wouldn't have done this without you... I owe you.
C: SURGEON SINCLAIR
D: Lucky to have a donor. Never would've survived the night. Have a suture ready.
C: NURSE
D: I heard it was a cop's heart.
E: picks up suture
N: Joe looks at the nurse.
C: NURSE
D: He was shot in the head a couple hours ago.
N: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON JOE
C: NURSE
D: They think it was gang related.
N: The BRIGHT LIGHTS OVERHEAD bleed the scene to WHITE and we --
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: WAVES - DAY crashing on white sand. PANNING with the clear blue water racing up the sand to a woman in a bathing suit, sitting alone. We PAN UP HER LEGS, past her stomach, to her CHEST where we see a SCAR ABOVE HER HEART. We CONTINUE UP TO HER FACE NOW. It's Cynthia. Staring out at the ocean. Palm trees behind her. She's beautiful. She leans back, hands behind her and... She smiles. Her life has changed. And we HEAR HAWAIIAN SLACK KEY GUITAR MUSIC as we --
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
