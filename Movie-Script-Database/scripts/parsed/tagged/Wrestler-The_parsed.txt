Action shots of RANDY "THE RAM" ROBINSON taking on a keffiyeh-wearing heel named THE AYATOLLAH before 20,000 screaming fans at Madison Square Garden. The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary: ----"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!" ----"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!" ----"The Ayatollah taking it to The Ram outside the ring!" ----"Ram absorbing tremendous punishment!

I don't believe it!" ----"Suplex!" ----"Powerbomb!" ----"Randy The Ram Robinson giving absolutely everything he's got! This is the very definition of heart!" ----"Just listen to this crowd! The entire Garden, 20,000 people, are on their feet!" ----"Ram climbing to the top rope... The crowd going wild... They know what's coming..." A PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms pressed against the sides of his head like RAM'S HORNS. ----"Uh-oh, the horns are out... Here it comes..." We FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah. ----"Ram Jam! Lights out!!" Over this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school. CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair. Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy, sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills with a beer. Promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out. As always.
E: a little sad
N: He hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It's not much.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Sorry. I was sure the gate'd be bigger.
E: CONT'D
N: Randy just shrugs resignedly.
S: EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s. FAN #1 Yo, Ram. Think you could...? Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up. Randy takes the program, happy to oblige. FAN #1 (CONT'D) I was there. Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER. The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging, crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the top, it says "EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!" FAN #2 (as Randy signs) My first match ever was you versus Davey Diamond at the Spectrum. (NOSTALGIC) Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood. FAN #2 (CONT'D) (vaguely sad) You were awesome. Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen. He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in. Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song. MUSIC: CINDERELLA - "DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT'S GONE)"
S: INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy is driving. On the dashboard is an old ACTION FIGURE OF HIMSELF from his WWF days. On the stereo, a different song plays, later in the same album. MUSIC: CINDERELLA - "FIRE AND ICE" Randy pulls into the entrance gate of PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK.
S: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads toward it. A dismayed look comes over his face. RANDY'S POV: The door is PADLOCKED. He tugs on the lock. Tugs on the door. No dice. He violently kicks the padlock in a moment of rage.
S: EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy resignedly climbs into the BACK OF HIS VAN.
S: INT. BACK OF VAN - LATER
N: Randy lies on a scrunched-up mattress on the floor, unable to sleep. The van wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built to himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini- posters, etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in the corner. He grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few, washing them down with a beer. He closes his eyes, trying to unwind.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BACK OF VAN - NEXT MORNING
N: Randy is asleep in his clothes from the night before. He's STIRRED AWAKE by the sound of kids YELLING and BANGING on the outside of van.
C: KID'S VOICE
D: Ram!
E: O.S.
N: He slowly sits upright, massaging his pain-wracked knees. Every inch of him feels like shit.
C: ANOTHER KID'S VOICE
D: Raaam!
E: O.S.
N: RANDY'S POV: Through the front windshield, TWO 8-YEAR-OLD KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, are peering in.
S: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - SHORT TIME LATER

S: INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randy glares at Len, the trailer park's MANAGER.
C: RANDY
D: C'mon, Len. Don't be such a fuckin' ballbreaker.
C: LEN THE MANAGER
D: You'll get in when I get my rent.
C: RANDY
D: You know I'm good for it.
C: LEN THE MANAGER
D: Sure. You're good for it every time this happens.
N: Randy sigh-groans in frustration.
C: RANDY
D: Can I at least park in back?
N: Len looks at Randy. A wave of pity comes over him.
C: LEN THE MANAGER
D: Twenty bucks.
S: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - IN BACK - EVENING
N: Randy sits on a MILK CRATE by his parked van. On the ground in front of him is a BLENDER connected to an extension cord stretching to another TRAILER. He pours a protein-shake packet into the blender. The trailer door opens. A WOMAN comes out. Lighting a cigarette, she looks up at the cloudless, starry sky.
C: RANDY
D: Thanks, Meg.
N: She gives Randy a small "You got it" wave.
T: CUT TO:

D: Hey, Wayne.
S: INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Sitting behind a desk is store manager WAYNE (40). He looks up at Randy, irked.
C: WAYNE
D: Do we not know how to knock?
N: Wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer.
C: WAYNE
D: Let's try that again.
E: CONT'D
N: Randy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks.
C: WAYNE
D: Come in!
E: CONT'D
N: Randy enters.
C: WAYNE
D: Oh, hi, Randy! What can I do for you?
E: CONT'D
N: Randy groans privately. He really hates Wayne.
C: RANDY
D: Do you have any extra shifts you could throw my way?
C: WAYNE
D: What's the matter, they raise the price of tights?
N: Randy is not amused. Wayne grabs a LOOSELEAF BINDER.
C: WAYNE
D: Let's see what we got.
E: CONT'D
N: Wayne starts flipping through.
C: RANDY
D: Pretty much anything weekday...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHOP-RITE - REAR LOADING DOCK - DAY
N: Randy, working alongside some MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a STACK OF BOXES off the back of a BOAR'S HEAD DELIVERY TRUCK. He carries the boxes through a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN, into a WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OGDEN'S GYM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY
N: Randy stands with GREGG, a huge bodybuilder who's counting off some bills. Randy growls with displeasure at the small, liquid-filled GLASS BOTTLE in his hand. ANGLE ON bottle: The label says SUSTANON 250. The rest of the label is in SPANISH.
C: GREGG
D: I'm tellin' ya, bro, it's identical to the German.
C: RANDY
D: I tried Mexican sus once. Gave me bitch tits.
C: GREGG
D: Years ago, right? Mexican's way better now.
C: RANDY
D: I don't want this.
C: GREGG
D: Bro, it's the same.
C: RANDY
D: I want my German.
C: GREGG
D: I don't have any.
C: RANDY
D: Yeah?
N: Randy steps in front of Gregg's locker and starts ROOTING AROUND.
C: GREGG
D: What are you doing?
N: Randy finds a bottle with GERMAN WRITING on it.
C: GREGG
D: That's my own stash. That's my last one.
E: CONT'D

C: SPOTTER
D: Push it out----you got this!
S: INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - LATER
N: A strip-mall tanning salon. Randy breezes in, nodding hello to the FRONT-DESK WOMAN, who's on the phone.

C: KOREAN LADY
D: Okay, okay, no problem.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. VAN - DAY
N: MUSIC: GREAT WHITE - "ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY" Randy is driving along Route 21. "Once Bitten Twice Shy" is blasting on the stereo. One hand on the wheel, he bangs out the song's piano riff on the dash with the other. He passes Cheetah's, a STRIP CLUB. He keeps an eye on it as he drives past. The song fades out. He pops the tape out of the deck and tosses it on the passenger seat. On it is a messy pile of old cassettes. Skid Row. Mötley Crüe. AC/DC. Guns `N' Roses. He sifts through the selection, one eye on the road.
S: INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
N: MUSIC: AC/DC - "BACK IN BLACK" Randy is still driving. AC/DC's "Back In Black" cranks loud. He pulls into the parking lot of a VFW HALL and parks.
S: INT. PASSAIC VFW HALL - CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
N: A makeshift locker room/staging area. Randy and 20 or so other WRESTLERS stand before the event's sleazy, tracksuit- clad promoter, NICK VOLPE.
C: NICK VOLPE
D: Listen up, only saying it once. Vic Storm, you're up first against D- Day. Second, Shawn McPride and Funkmaster Garry B. Slick. Third, Frankie Cirillo and Rob Dynamo versus J.T. Anvil and The Ultimate Freak. Fourth, Teddy Brewski and Lex Lethal. Intermission. Fifth, Samoan Savages versus the Disco Brothers. Sixth, the Irish Warrior and Vyper. Seventh, "Sandman" Steve Sambuca versus Hollywood. Last but not least, for the strap, Kid Loco versus Randy The Ram. Got it? Good.
N: Volpe walks off.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy sits alone a table toward the back. He takes a roll of athletic tape out of his supplies-filled WHEELIE TRAVEL BAG. He starts WRAPPING HIS KNEES AND ANKLES. He does it in a slow, methodical manner. It feels almost ritualistic.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy is hashing out the match with his opponent, a wiry Puerto Rican kid whose shiny vinyl pants identify him as KID LOCO (22).
C: RANDY
D: Right there, you post me. Hard. I show color.
N: Kid Loco nods, listening closely, deferential to the legend.
C: RANDY
D: You post me again. Again. You're fuckin' whalin' on my ass.
E: CONT'D Kid Loco nods
C: LEX LETHAL
D: Ram.
E: O.S.
N: Randy turns and sees fellow wrestler LEX LETHAL sticking his head into the cafeteria door.
C: LEX LETHAL
D: There's some chick out here looking for you.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: Who?
C: LEX LETHAL
D: Some chick.
E: SHRUGS
C: RANDY
D: Ring rat?
C: LEX LETHAL
D: I don't think so.
S: INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randy emerges from the cafeteria. A look of PLEASED SURPRISE comes over his face.
C: RANDY
D: What's up, kiddo?
N: RANDY'S POV: Standing there in an otherwise empty hallway is a plain-ish YOUNG WOMAN (22). She looks at him with an unsmiling expression. This is STEPHANIE.
C: RANDY
D: Long time no see.
E: CONT'D
N: Randy pulls her in for a hug. She doesn't really hug back. She steps back, breaking off the hug. A brief, awkward pause.
C: RANDY
D: Whatcha doing here? Here to root on your old man?
E: CONT'D
N: She shakes her head no.
C: RANDY
D: That's okay----as long as you're not rooting against me!
E: CONT'D
N: She is irked by his jokiness.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Is there someplace we can talk?
C: RANDY
D: I'm on in a sec.
C: STEPHANIE
D: It won't take much of your time.
C: RANDY
D: What's up?
C: STEPHANIE
D: I'm here because...
N: Stephanie gathers herself. This isn't easy for her.
C: STEPHANIE
D: I came to make amends.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: Amends?
C: STEPHANIE
D: I'm supposed to talk to people I've hurt.
N: Randy is puzzled for a moment. Then, it clicks in.
C: RANDY
D: Ohh... 12-stepper.
C: STEPHANIE
D: AA.
E: NODS
C: RANDY
D: Good for you. That's great.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Thank you. I'm sure you mean that.
C: RANDY
D: I do.
N: She smile-nods insincerely.
C: RANDY
D: So's that it?
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHANIE
D: I need to apologize.
C: RANDY
D: For what?
C: STEPHANIE
D: For anything I've done or said over the years. All the anger at you.
C: RANDY
D: Okay...
C: STEPHANIE
D: Like the last time I saw you... I'm sorry for what I said.
C: RANDY
D: Don't worry about it.
E: dismissive wave
N: Stephanie is irked by his lack of engagement. She looks at him with suspicion.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Do you even know what I said?
C: RANDY
D: Sure.
C: STEPHANIE
D: What did I say?
C: RANDY
D: It was about your mom. And me. Like, how I was bad.
E: vague, flailing
C: STEPHANIE
D: You have no idea.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Raa-am!
E: O.S.
N: Randy turns and sees TWO MEATHEAD FANS down the hall, headed his way. MEATHEAD #1 Whassup, yo? Randy The Ram! MEATHEAD #1 gives Randy an excited high-five. MEATHEAD #2 We gonna see some action tonight?
C: RANDY
D: Tonight's forecast calls for severe butt-whoopin's with a 100 percent chance of pain.
E: sly grin
N: Psyched "Yeah!"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at the interruption. And, even more, Randy's embrace of it. MEATHEAD #1 Could we get a picture?
C: RANDY
D: No problemo.
N: The two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie, holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA. MEATHEAD #1 Think you could...? She coldly takes it.
C: STEPHANIE
D: No problemo.
N: She looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically, making his best "Aaargh!" wrestling face. Stephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back. MEATHEAD #1 Thanks a lot, yo. Kick some ass out there.
C: RANDY
D: You know it, broski!
N: The meatheads excitedly head off. Randy turns his attention back to Stephanie, who's glaring at him with cold disgust.
C: RANDY
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHANIE
D: Same shit.
C: RANDY
D: They're fans.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Same old shit.
C: RANDY
D: I hafta. It's work.
C: STEPHANIE
D: I'm in the middle of saying something important and you drop it for the fucking wrestling.
C: RANDY
D: I didn't ask them to come over.
C: STEPHANIE
D: It's like I'm 10 all over again.
C: RANDY
D: Are we almost done with this?
C: STEPHANIE
D: This what?
C: RANDY
D: This ATTACK.
N: She looks at him calmly. Sadly.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Yeah. We're done.
N: She walks off.
T: HARD CUT TO:
S: INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick. Kid Loco falls to the canvas. Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up their cheers. Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN THE HEAD. Randy goes down. Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest- to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him. Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back, presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams down on his back. As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE TURNBUCKLE. RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded cover. Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm. Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the exposed metal post beneath. Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade along his hairline. No one sees it happen. BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED. Kid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again. Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts around the ring.
C: KID LOCO
D: Look at this loser! How pathetic.
N: ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the Hulk. Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super- charged. A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is about to turn. Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the hair. He pulls him in close.
C: RANDY
D: Let's go home.
E: under breath
N: Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no. Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE DOWN with his feet over the ropes. Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again. Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes. He scurries away. Randy goes after him. Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks. Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable. Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks out at the crowd. RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.
C: TRIO
D: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
N: Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.
C: WHOLE CROWD
D: RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
E: O.S.
N: Randy "mulls" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks at the corner. He heads for the corner. Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd like he's still undecided. RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation. Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening montage.) He LEAPS. The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses. The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The money shot.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LATER
N: Randy, on a post-match high, sits on a cafeteria table enjoying a beer as a pseudo-MEDIC stitches up his hairline gash. Nick Volpe wanders over.

N: Randy smiles contentedly. He sure did.
C: NICK VOLPE
D: Yo, Ram. Got a sec?
E: O.S.
N: Nick Volpe comes over.

N: Randy sees an excited smile creep across Volpe's face.
C: RANDY
D: Whatcha thinkin'?
C: NICK VOLPE

N: Randy is instantly intrigued.
C: NICK VOLPE

E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: Yeah?
C: NICK VOLPE
D: Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary. Hundreds, thousands of screaming fans watching you two make history for the second time.

C: NICK VOLPE
D: For this? I bet he'd be willing to dust off the old turban.
E: cool, confident nod
N: Randy's mouth is practically watering.

S: EXT. CHEETAH'S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
N: A spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier. Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman.
C: BIG CHRIS
D: Whassup, Ram? How ya been?
C: RANDY
D: Yo, Big Chris.
N: They chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight.
C: BIG CHRIS
D: Hey, can you get me any more of that IGF-1?
E: into Randy's ear
C: RANDY
D: What do I look like, some fuckin' two-bit street dealer?

S: INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
N: MUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - "STUNTIN' LIKE MY DADDY" A crowded, not-very-glamorous Jersey strip club. Randy stands over by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer.
C: RANDY
D: Thanks, hon.
N: Randy takes a swig, looking around the club.
C: RANDY
D: Cassidy around?
E: CONT'D
C: BARTENDER
D: I think she's VIP-in'.
N: Randy, nodding, takes his beer and heads over toward the STAGE. He settles in at an open table. ON STAGE: A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to "Stuntin' Like My Daddy", a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song. RANDY: Randy, watching her, quickly grows bored. He finds the stripper, like the song, crude and soulless.
S: INT. CHEETAH'S - MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Randy is at the urinal. He flushes and heads over to the sink. He washes his hands, checking his look in the mirror. He primps a little.
S: INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Randy exits the bathroom and heads back toward the table. En route, he passes a curtained-off VIP ROOM.
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Trust me, babe. You're gonna be happy.
E: O.S.
N: Randy, hearing this, slows. DUDE #1 (O.S.) We said the other one. DUDE #2 (O.S.) The redhead. With the belly chain. Randy peeks through the curtain. Inside, he sees CASSIDY (36), a sexy, tattooed, aging rocker chick in a white spandex dress. With her are six hair-gelled, goombah-wannabe BACHELOR- PARTY DUDES (early 20s). The BACHELOR is sitting in a chair in the middle.
C: CASSIDY
D: Sorry, guys, she's on break.
N: DUDE #1 Well, I'm sorry, but we don't want you. DUDE #3 How old are you, anyway?
C: BACHELOR
D: You're, like, my mom's age.
N: Stifled laughter from his buddies. OTHER SIDE OF CURTAIN: Randy's anger builds as he watches. VIP ROOM: Cassidy, trying to salvage the gig, straddles the bachelor.
C: CASSIDY
D: There's nothing like experience. I've done things your little fiancee's never dreamed of...
E: into his ear, seductive
N: DUDE #2 Yeah, like graduate in 1985. This cracks his friends up. Randy BURSTS THROUGH THE CURTAIN.
C: RANDY
D: Apologize to this lady.
E: to Dude #2
N: Everyone is taken aback, including Cassidy. DUDE #3 Who the hell are you?
C: RANDY
D: You speak to her with respect.
N: Cassidy wedges herself between Randy and Dude #2.
C: CASSIDY
D: I got this. It's okay.
C: RANDY
D: No, it's not okay. This is definitely not okay.
N: He turns to the bachelor.
C: RANDY
D: I guarantee this woman's 50 times hotter than whatever goombah skank you're about to marry.
E: CONT'D
N: DUDE #4 (to Dude #1) You hear what he just called Gina?! DUDE #1 That's my fuckin' sister! Dude #1 steps to Randy, chest puffed out. Randy whips around and GRABS THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER THE BACHELOR. He wields it menacingly at Dude #1, who backpedals, terrified. Randy makes like he's going to hit the guy with the chair. Instead, he FLINGS IT AT THE WALL. DUDE #2 DUDE #1 Jesus!! What the FUCK!! The entire bachelor party rushes for the curtain. Just like that, they're GONE. Randy looks at Cassidy, expecting a hearty thank you. Instead he gets a PISSED-OFF SHOVE.

S: INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
N: MUSIC: KHIA - "MY NECK, MY BACK" Randy is getting a LAPDANCE from Cassidy. She plants her hands against the mirrored wall behind him, her body just inches from his face.
C: RANDY
D: We're talking one of the historic matches in history. 20,000 people. Another million and a half watching at home on pay-per-view.
N: She turns, giving him a nice view of her writhing behind. On the small of her back is an AC/DC TATTOO.
C: RANDY
D: We were going back and forth, just killin' each other for a half hour. Any wrestling fan, they know all about it.
E: CONT'D
C: CASSIDY
D: Million and a half? Shit.

N: Cassidy turns around again. Randy looks her body up and down, savoring her curves as she dances just for him.
C: RANDY
D: Goddamn you are smokin'.
E: CONT'D
N: Cassidy smiles a little. This makes her feel good. "My Neck My Back" ENDS. Cassidy pulls back on her dress and casually sits down next to him. A new song comes on. MUSIC: PITBULL - "UNA MANO LAVA LA OTRA" They look toward the stage, where a PUERTO RICAN STRIPPER shakes her ass to the staccato, abrasive Latin rap song.
C: RANDY
D: Who knows. I put on a good show...

C: RANDY

D: Jesus.
E: CONT'D
N: Randy follows her eyes to his HAIRLINE.
C: CASSIDY
D: You're bleeding.

D: Got cut tonight.
C: CASSIDY
D: You okay?
C: RANDY
D: Ah, it's nothing.
C: CASSIDY
D: And they say wrestling's fake.
E: small chuckle
N: Randy proudly holds out his arm.
C: RANDY
D: How's this for fake?
N: CASSIDY'S POV: A long-ish SCAR on Randy's bicep.
C: CASSIDY
D: What's that from?
C: RANDY
D: 1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. Loose nail tore the bicep open.
C: CASSIDY
D: Ow. Fuck.
C: RANDY
D: I got even better.
N: He pulls down his shirt collar, revealing a nasty COLLARBONE SCAR.

C: CASSIDY
D: Doesn't it hurt?
C: RANDY
D: Not when they're going crazy for you...
E: BLISSFUL

C: CASSIDY
D: "He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we were healed."
N: Randy contemplates the quote. He likes it.
C: RANDY
D: What's that?
C: CASSIDY
D: It's from "Passion of the Christ". You never seen it?
E: BEAT
N: Randy shrugs no.
C: CASSIDY
D: Dude, you gotta. It's amazing.
E: CONT'D
N: She sits down next to him again.
C: CASSIDY
D: It's, like, so inspiring. They throw everything at Him. Whips, arrows, rocks... Just beat the living fuck out of Him for the whole two hours. And He just takes it.
E: CONT'D

D: God bless hardcore...
S: INT. DOLLAR TREE - SHORT TIME LATER
N: A Long Island strip-mall 99-CENT STORE. Randy and Lex browse an aisle. Randy is holding a TIN CAKE PAN. He bangs it against his forehead, testing it out. It makes a LOUD CLANG.

N: Lex takes the pan, testing it against his own head.
C: LEX LETHAL
D: Cookie trays were better.
N: Lex spots something exciting on another shelf.

N: They head off in search.
S: INT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - GYM - LATER
N: MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)" Randy stands BEHIND A CURTAIN as his entrance song plays. He sneaks a peek through it. RANDY'S POV: A ROWDY CROWD of about 150 fills a COMMUNITY- CENTER GYM. The vibe of the crowd is a bit rougher than previous events. A banner on the wall reads ECHW - EAST COAST HARDCORE WRESTLING. Pressed against the outside of the ring are a FOLDING TABLE and a 12-FOOT METAL LADDER. THE RING: An ANNOUNCER stands with a microphone.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Ladies and gentlemen...

E: O.S. BEAT
N: THE GYM: Randy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship. He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same. Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He obliges as many as he possibly can. Fans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in the opening montage.) He "rams" each one with his forehead.
C: AC/DC
D: If you want blood, You got it!/ If you want blood, You got it!
N: He does a lap around the perimeter of the ring, enthusiastically head-butting chairs the whole way.
C: AC/DC

C: ANNOUNCER
D: And his opponent: From Hampton, Virginia, weighing in at 295 pounds...
N: The boos begin to rain down.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Hellbilly Cannibaaaal!
E: CONT'D
N: Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge, overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK. A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK. Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where Randy awaits. They sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag. Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of "slaps". After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around the ring clutching his face, howling in agony. Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE. Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube explodes with a pop. Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent jolt as the chair hits the mat. Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times. Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster. He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and crashes into Randy knee-first. Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the concrete floor. Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an exhilarated panic. Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs. Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere. Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST. Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down. Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal, showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head into the can and falls on it, ass-first. Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET. With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair, carrying the ladder in his other hand. Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table. Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF. In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him. Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet. Randy hits him with a dropkick. Randy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out. Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat. Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at the air. RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They assume it's part of the act. Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.
C: HELLBILLY CANNIBAL
D: Is there a doctor?
N: Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag. Among those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's promoter. He climbs into the ring. Kneels over Randy.
C: JERRY DIFUSCO
D: Randy. You okay?
N: Randy is gasping. DiFusco turns to Hellbilly Cannibal.
C: JERRY DIFUSCO
D: Call 911.
E: CONT'D
N: Lex Lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the ring. They huddle around Randy.
C: JERRY DIFUSCO
D: Let's get him up.
E: CONT'D
N: With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him to the ropes. They slow, unsure how best to get him through.
C: LEX LETHAL
D: Put him down.
N: They lower him to the mat. Lex hops out of the ring and grabs Randy's ankles. Several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting Randy's underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out. By now, the crowd realizes this is real. They surge forward as DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit.
C: JERRY DIFUSCO
D: Get back, get back, get back.
S: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Randy is carried down a LONG HALLWAY, trailed by curious and concerned fans. Lex is closest to Randy's head.

N: They reach a door and enter. The wrestler holding Randy's feet shuts it behind them.
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy lies on a table, his eyes rolling back in his head. Lex squeezes his hand, trying to keep him conscious.

T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: INT. POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NEXT DAY
N: Randy lies asleep. The breathing tube is out. The chest tube is still in. His eyes slowly open. He looks around, disoriented. Woozy. Confused by all the wires on him, he starts PULLING THINGS OFF. Monitors BEEP. Nurses rush into the room, calming him down as they try to reattach the wires. He faints.
S: INT. RANDY'S ROOM - NEXT DAY
N: Randy, transferred to a regular hospital room, is watching "All My Children" on the wall-mounted TV. The chest tube is out, in its place a large bandage.

D: Your heart... You're going to have to start taking much better care of it.
C: RANDY
D: Like...
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: For starters, you must take your medication every day.
C: RANDY
D: I could handle that.
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: No smoking. And no cocaine.
E: Randy nods
C: RANDY
D: I don't do coke.

C: DR. TARACHANDANI

C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: As for exercise, it's still okay, as long as it's moderate.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: So, like, wrestling...
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: Not a good idea.
C: RANDY
D: What if I do it moderate? I could hold back on certain moves. There's always ways to fake----
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: Mr. Ramovic...
C: RANDY
D: Randy.
E: edgy glare
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: Randy, a man with your heart should not be flying around a ring crashing into people.
N: Randy's nostrils flare.
C: RANDY
D: With all due respect, Dr... (reads name tag,
C: MISPRONOUNCING)
D: ...Trachanani, I'd like a second opinion on that.
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: Of course. But I promise you, any doctor I showed your file would say the same thing.
N: Randy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort.
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: You almost died. The next time, you won't be so lucky.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: I want a second opinion.
C: DR. TARACHANDANI
D: Your heart's been through a lot. Even before the heart attack, it was significantly----
C: RANDY
D: I want a second opinion. I WANT A SECOND OPINION.

C: REST UP, FEEL BETTER. ----JERRY DIFUSCO
D: PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS
N: Randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300. He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket.
C: ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN
D: You have somebody picking you up?
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: Yeah.
S: EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER

C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Robin Ramovic?
E: O.S.

C: PHARMACIST
D: Robin Ramovic?
N: Randy heads toward her.
C: PHARMACIST
D: Is that you?
E: CONT'D

C: LEN THE MANAGER
D: Welcome home.
S: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER
N: A messy, junk-filled trailer. Randy stands at the kitchen counter with the CVS bag. He opens the bag and takes out FOUR PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLES. We catch a glimpse of the drug names on them: PLAVIX. COREG. LIPITOR, LISINOPRIL. He gazes at the patient name on all of them... RAMOVIC, ROBIN
S: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER

S: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
N: Randy lies on the bed, gazing off. Restless. Bored. Something catches his eye. RANDY'S POV: On the floor, in front of the TV, is an old NINTENDO VIDEOGAME SYSTEM. The game cartridge in the console is WRESTLEJAM `88.
S: EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy sticks his head out of his trailer. RANDY'S POV: In front of the opposite trailer, ADAM (8), one of the kids he was play-wrestling with, is idly throwing a tennis ball against a car.
C: RANDY
D: Yo, Adam!
N: Adam turns and looks toward Randy.
C: RANDY
D: Wanna play Nintendo?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy and Adam sit on the floor playing WrestleJam `88. ON TV: Cyber-Randy is wrestling The Ayatollah at a packed Madison Square Garden. The graphics are late-'80s crude. Randy flies all over the ring, devastating his foe with a series of acrobatic leaps and kicks and flips. RANDY AND ADAM: Randy wears a look of intense concentration. Adam makes a scrunched-up face at the screen.
C: ADAM
D: What's that square?
C: RANDY
D: What square?
C: ADAM
D: That you're hitting me with.
C: RANDY
D: It's a folding chair.
C: ADAM
D: That's a chair?
C: RANDY
D: Yes, it's a chair.
E: PISSY
N: Randy grunts, annoyed. They play for a stretch in silence.
C: ADAM
D: This is old.
C: RANDY
D: 1988 ain't old.
C: ADAM
D: That was, like, 50 years before I was born.
C: RANDY
D: Shut up and fight.

N: Adam looks toward the window. Randy hits PAUSE.
C: ADAM
D: Coming!
N: Adam turns back to the TV.
C: RANDY
D: Ready?
N: Adam nods yeah. Randy un-pauses. Play resumes. ON TV: Cyber-Randy drops The Ayatollah with a knee to the chest. And another. The Ayatollah GOES DOWN. Randy heads to a corner and CLIMBS TO THE TOP ROPE. He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM'S HORNS. Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The crowd goes wild. RANDY AND ADAM: Randy does a little celebratory fist pump. He hits RESET.
C: RANDY
D: One more?
C: ADAM
D: I gotta go.
C: RANDY
D: Don't you wanna get even? I whipped your butt.
C: ADAM
D: That's okay.
N: Adam gets up and scampers out of the trailer. Randy, suddenly alone, looks at the TV. He gazes at the words on the screen: 1 PLAYER 2 PLAYER He selects 1 PLAYER. A new match begins. Randy plays without much enthusiasm. After a few halfhearted kicks and punches, he TOSSES THE CONTROLLER ASIDE.
S: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING JACK. He does another. A few more. He feels himself getting winded. A little woozy. He sits down. He sits still, trying to slow his heart. He starts to CRY. Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.
S: INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT
N: Randy enters the club. It's crowded tonight. He looks around for Cassidy. He spots her in a corner offering a CUSTOMER a lapdance. The customer passes. She moves on. Randy heads over. She gives him a friendly little cheek peck.
C: CASSIDY
D: Hey, sweetie. You're back soon.
C: RANDY
D: Ah, I was just in the neighborhood.
N: Cassidy nods oh.
C: RANDY
D: Hey, feel like maybe grabbing a burger?

N: Cassidy finds the offer a little odd. This isn't how they operate.
C: CASSIDY
D: I'm working.
C: RANDY
D: How `bout later, then?
N: She looks at him, puzzled. He seems off.
C: CASSIDY
D: You okay?
C: RANDY
D: Can we talk for a sec?
C: CASSIDY
D: Sure. What's up?
C: RANDY
D: Someplace more quiet.
N: Randy glances toward the door. Cassidy, catching his drift, looks at him, a little gravely.
C: CASSIDY
D: Randy, I can't leave with a customer.
N: Pause.
C: RANDY
D: I had a heart attack.
C: CASSIDY
D: Shit. When?
C: RANDY
D: I needed to talk to somebody.
C: CASSIDY
D: You can't talk here?
C: RANDY
D: Just a couple minutes.
C: CASSIDY
D: Randy, I don't do that.
C: RANDY
D: Please.
N: Cassidy looks at him, torn. She sees the need, the fear in his eyes.
C: CASSIDY
D: Where are you parked?
C: RANDY
D: In back.
N: Another pause of hesitation from Cassidy. This is big.
C: CASSIDY
D: Go to your car. I'll meet you out there in 15 minutes.
S: EXT. CHEETAH'S - REAR PARKING LOT - 15 MINUTES LATER
N: Randy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear EMERGENCY EXIT. Cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. Randy waves. Spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the passenger side.
C: RANDY
D: Thanks. I appreciate it.
C: CASSIDY
D: That's okay.
N: She looks at his vulnerable expression.
C: CASSIDY

D: Oh, man. That's terrible.
C: RANDY
D: Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.
N: He chuckles, a little perversely.
C: RANDY
D: Tell ya, though, it was a big hit with the fans. Promoter told me everybody was hanging around wondering if I was okay, they wound up buying up all of his T-shirts and shit. Whole merch table got cleaned out.
E: CONT'D amused grin
C: CASSIDY
D: That's funny.
N: Randy's grin fades. His expression turns melancholy, fearful.
C: RANDY
D: Doctor says I can't wrestle no more.
C: CASSIDY
D: Damn. What are you gonna do?
C: RANDY
D: I don't know. I don't know what to do. If I can't wrestle...
N: He loses himself in some bleak thought.
C: CASSIDY
D: It just happened. You don't have to figure everything out this second. Give yourself some time.
C: RANDY
D: Time's all I got. I just sit there all day...
N: He stares off bleakly again.
C: CASSIDY
D: You really shouldn't be alone right now.
N: He turns to her, looking her in the eye.
C: RANDY
D: That's why I came to see you.
C: CASSIDY
D: Randy...
E: a little unnerved
N: She looks at him with sympathy.
C: CASSIDY
D: I feel bad what happened. But you and me... I can't go there.
E: CONT'D
N: Randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.
C: CASSIDY
D: You should be with family now. You have a daughter, right? Where is she?
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: We don't really get along too good.
C: CASSIDY
D: It doesn't matter. You need her.
C: RANDY
D: She don't need me.
E: bitter chuckle
C: CASSIDY
D: Everybody needs a father. Trust me.
N: Randy shrugs, not so sure. Cassidy glances at the dashboard clock.
C: CASSIDY
D: I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.
E: CONT'D
N: She puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.
C: CASSIDY
D: You take care of yourself.
E: CONT'D
N: She gives him a peck on the cheek. He lingers there for a second. A weird, tentative moment.
C: CASSIDY
D: You gonna be okay?
E: CONT'D
N: He nods, putting his brave face back on.
C: RANDY
D: I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken bigger bumps than this.
C: CASSIDY
D: I'm sure.
C: RANDY
D: Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.
C: CASSIDY
D: You should.
C: RANDY
D: Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A person only gets one father in this life.
C: CASSIDY
D: Exactly.
C: RANDY
D: Unless you're adopted.
N: Cassidy laughs. She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.
C: CASSIDY
D: You're gonna be just fine.
C: RANDY
D: Definitely.
N: Cassidy climbs out of the van. Randy watches as she heads back into the club. His cheery expression fades. He is alone again.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY
N: Randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO. RANDY'S POV: It's a mid-'80s photo of Randy and his infant daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree. Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing, Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep. He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled PHONE NUMBERS. They're all crossed-out except the last one. The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top, as if they've been written down over the course of years.
S: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone cradled to his ear.
C: STEPHANIE'S VOICE
D: This is Stephanie, you know what to do.
E: answering machine BEEP
N: Randy listens to the silence. He hangs up.
S: INT. VAN - LATER
N: Randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle- class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to approach.
S: EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself, he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T- SHIRT and PANTIES.
C: RANDY
D: Hey... Is Stephanie home?
E: a little thrown
N: The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is.
C: THE WOMAN
D: Who can I say it is?
C: RANDY
D: Her father.
N: She disappears into the house. A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy.
C: RANDY
D: Where you going?
E: CONT'D
N: He goes after her.
C: RANDY
D: Stephanie!
E: CONT'D
N: He catches up. She stops.
C: STEPHANIE
D: What do you want?
C: RANDY
D: Can we talk?
C: STEPHANIE
D: Now's really not a good time.
N: She resumes walking, briskly.
C: RANDY
D: Wait! Where ya going?
E: chasing after her
N: He looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT.
C: RANDY
D: You in school? That's great.
E: CONT'D
N: She turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following.
C: RANDY
D: What school?
E: CONT'D
N: No answer.
C: RANDY
D: What school?
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHANIE
D: Middlesex County Community.
C: RANDY
D: Middlesex? That's kind of a hike. Where's your car? You taking the bus? Lemme give you a lift.
E: no response
C: STEPHANIE
D: That's okay.
C: RANDY
D: It's no problem. Really. I'm parked right by.
E: BEAT
N: Stephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him.
C: RANDY
D: You're walking pretty fast there. You running late? I could help you with that. Give you a ride.
E: CONT'D no answer no answer
N: She keeps right on walking.
C: RANDY
D: New Jersey Transit sucks!
E: CONT'D
N: And walking.
C: RANDY
D: The buses smell like piss!
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: She fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit.
S: INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy is driving Stephanie.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Left at the second stop sign.
C: RANDY
D: Yes, ma'am!
N: Randy drives. He slows at the second stop sign, which is at a bigger, FOUR-LANE STREET. He makes the left. They drive for a stretch in awkward silence. Randy seems a little nervous.
C: STEPHANIE
D: You gonna talk?
N: A pause as Randy gathers his words.
C: RANDY
D: There's something I wanted to tell you.
C: STEPHANIE
D: Okay...
C: RANDY
D: I had a heart attack. Last week.
E: BEAT
N: He looks at her earnestly.
C: RANDY
D: I wanna try to fix things.
E: CONT'D
N: Stephanie sits there in calm silence, processing all of this.
C: STEPHANIE
D: You are such an asshole.
C: RANDY
D: Why?
E: taken aback
C: STEPHANIE
D: Now you wanna fix things. Now that suddenly you're all scared and alone from your heart attack.
C: RANDY
D: What? No. It's not like----
C: STEPHANIE
D: This is so fuckin' you. You only come around when you need something from somebody, when they can do something for you. Selfish fuck. Good. Be alone.
N: She suddenly OPENS HER DOOR as the van is moving. She HOPS OUT. Randy hits the brakes, alarmed.
C: RANDY
D: What are you doing?
N: Stephanie stumbles and falls. She gets up. Walks off in the direction they came from.
C: RANDY
D: Stephanie!
E: CONT'D
N: She's gone. He angrily punches the steering wheel.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT
N: Randy lies on his bed, gazing off depressedly. On his chest is a well-worn DAY PLANNER, open to a marked-up page. ANGLE ON page. Scribbled in marker in one of the boxes is RAHWAY AUTOGRAF SHOW.
S: INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - MORNING
N: Randy, standing at a folding table in a gym, unzips a duffel bag. He pulls out a stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES of himself. It's a high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the height of his '80s glory. He puts them on the table. Looks around the gym. RANDY'S POV: He's at an AUTOGRAPH SHOW that hasn't started yet. Around the perimeter of the gym, TEN FOLDING TABLES are set up. At each one, a BEAT-UP, WORN-OUT OLD WRESTLER is laying out his wares----8x10s, old match tapes, etc.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Didn't think I'd see you here.
E: O.S.
N: Randy looks up and sees Scott Brumberg, the promoter from the beginning. He's wearing the same "BRUMBERG - 44" Mets jersey.
C: RANDY
D: Why not?
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Heard you collapsed at the DiFusco show. Sounded pretty scary.
N: Randy smiles coyly.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: Sold the shit outta that one.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: No way!
C: RANDY
D: I gotta give credit. DiFusco came up with the idea. We're setting up an angle for a grudge match.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Wow... Dude, you are good.
N: Randy gives a proud "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: I was sure I'd have to cancel the minivan.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: What minivan?
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: The one I rented for Fanfest.
N: Randy looks at him, surprised.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Me and a whole gang's driving down. Terry C., Caggiano, Fatback... I am so fuckin' psyched. You see the flyer?
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: Randy looks at him blankly. Brumberg walks over to a nearby table, where there's a stack of BRIGHT-ORANGE FLYERS. (The same flyer can be seen scattered around the room on chairs, the floor, etc.) He grabs one and brings it back over.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Volpe gave me an assload to pass out.
E: CONT'D
N: He hands it to Brumberg.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: That is gonna be epic.
E: CONT'D
N: RANDY'S POV: The flyer.
C: NICK VOLPE PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS
D: "LEGENDS OF THE RING" FANFEST MAY 5-6, 2008
N: GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA
C: I THE MAIN EVENT...

SEXXY, CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, CHRIS COLUMBO... AND MANY MORE! RANDY: Randy nods vaguely at the flyer, his feelings hard to read.
C: RANDY
D: Looks great.
N: Brumberg looks around the room as the wrestlers set up shop.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Should get a pretty good crowd today.
N: Randy holds up his hand, wiggling his fingers for Brumberg.
C: RANDY
D: I'll start loosening up.
N: Brumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour expression comes over his face.
S: INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
N: The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room, drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking photos with the motley assortment of washed-up aging wrestlers. ON RANDY: Randy is sitting behind his table, signing one of his 8x10s for a FAN. He hands it to the guy, who hands Randy a $5 bill.
C: FAN
D: Thanks.
C: RANDY
D: You got it, broski.
N: The fan walks off. Randy tucks the fiver into the FANNY PACK he's wearing. There's not much in there, just a meager few ones and fives. Randy zips up the fanny pack. He looks up, ready to sign more autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over.
S: INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks around the room at the other wrestlers. RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble stream of urine trickles into the bag. Randy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the table. He gazes numbly at the high-flying image of himself from 20 years earlier.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: Sorry, man.
E: O.S.
N: Randy looks up and sees Brumberg.
C: SCOTT BRUMBERG
D: I was sure the turnout'd be bigger.
E: CONT'D
N: Randy shrugs resignedly.
S: INT. VAN - LATER
N: Randy pulls up to his trailer. He sits there with the engine idling, staring at his trailer, scared to go in alone. He pulls back out again.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER
N: MUSIC - LIL' KIM - "HOW MANY LICKS?" Cassidy, roaming the room, approaches a CUSTOMER sitting near the stafe. She leans in to his ear, her hand on his arm.
C: CASSIDY
D: Would you like a lapdance, sweetie?
C: CUSTOMER
D: That's okay.
N: Cassidy moves along. She approaches a PAIR OF GUYS. She leans in to one of them.
C: CASSIDY
D: Would you like a lapdance?
N: GUY #1 Not right now. She looks toward the other guy. Before she can even ask: GUY #2 I'm good. Cassidy heads off, rejected.
C: RANDY
D: Hey.
E: O.S.
N: She turns and sees Randy. She's happy to see him after the string of no's.
C: CASSIDY
D: Hey. How ya feeling?
C: RANDY
D: Better. Good.
N: She leads him over to a table. They sit.
C: CASSIDY
D: How'd it go with your daughter?
C: RANDY
D: Good. Fine.
E: UNCONVINCING
C: CASSIDY
D: Yeah?
N: Randy dodges her eye contact.
C: CASSIDY
D: You sure?
E: CONT'D
N: Pause.
C: RANDY
D: Not too good, actually. She tore me a new asshole.
C: CASSIDY
D: Shit. That sucks.
N: He nods dispiritedly.
C: CASSIDY
D: It's tough. You can't give up. You gotta keep trying.
E: CONT'D
N: Another half-hearted nod. A brief conversational lull.
C: RANDY
D: I was thinking about maybe getting her a present.
C: CASSIDY
D: That's a great idea! What's she into?
E: BEAT
C: RANDY
D: I'm not sure.
C: CASSIDY
D: How old is she?
C: RANDY
D: 22, 23?
E: BEAT
C: CASSIDY
D: What kind of music does she like?
C: RANDY
D: I don't know.
C: CASSIDY
D: Is she into books? Cooking?
N: Randy just looks at her blankly.
C: CASSIDY
D: How could you not know? She's your daughter.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: I'm a shitty fuckin' father.
N: Cassidy, feeling bad, is hit with an urge to help.
C: CASSIDY
D: She's 22? Okay... You should get her some clothes, some kinda clothes... All girls like that.
E: RIFFING
C: RANDY
D: That could work.
C: CASSIDY
D: I know the perfect place. This kick- ass little vintage shop in Westfield.
C: RANDY
D: Yeah?
C: CASSIDY
D: Saturday's the best time to go. That's when they get the new stuff in, all these boxes full of great shit.
C: RANDY
D: Okay. Cool.
C: CASSIDY
D: I'll write it down.
N: Cassidy grabs a pen and a cocktail napkin off the bar.
C: CASSIDY
D: I'm pretty sure it's on 28.
E: CONT'D
N: She scribbles down YESTERDAZE - WESTFIELD. Hands it to him.
C: RANDY
D: Good tip. Thanks.
C: CASSIDY
D: You got it.
N: Cassidy starts dancing for him, as is their routine. Randy doesn't seem into it.
C: RANDY
D: I'm gonna grab a drink at the bar.
N: Randy gets up and heads off toward the bar. She watches him go, feeling rejected. Cassidy gets up. CAMERA stays on her face as she does a lap around the club. She glances back toward the bar. CASSIDY'S POV: Randy is sitting at bar. She scans the room. A CUSTOMER is looking her way. She starts to approach. Then, she STOPS. She looks back toward Randy again. He's sitting at the bar alone. She heads over to him. He looks up from his drink.
C: RANDY
D: That was fast.
E: CONT'D
C: CASSIDY
D: Listen...
N: Cassidy pauses, hesitant. She takes the plunge:
C: CASSIDY
D: How `bout I meet you there Saturday? Help you out.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: Yeah?
C: CASSIDY
D: I'm actually gonna be running around right in that area anyway, so it's not really a pain.
E: "CASUAL"
C: RANDY
D: All right. Thanks.
C: CASSIDY
D: No problem. You got it.
N: She gives him a chummy arm tap and walks off.

S: INT. SHOP-RITE - MORNING
N: Randy knocks on Wayne's door.
C: WAYNE
D: Yeah?
E: O.S.
S: INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Wayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game.
C: RANDY
D: Hey, Wayne. Got a sec?
C: WAYNE
D: Not really. What?
C: RANDY
D: I was wondering if you had something more steady. Full-time.
C: WAYNE
D: Only thing I got right now's got weekends.
C: RANDY
D: That works.
C: WAYNE
D: Isn't that when you sit on other dudes' faces?
C: RANDY
D: What is it?
C: WAYNE
D: Deli counter.
N: Randy seems a little hesitant.
C: RANDY
D: So, like, working with customers?
C: WAYNE
D: All day long, hot horny housewives begging for your meat. And prepared salads.
E: BEAT
N: Randy thinks it over.
C: RANDY
D: That's the only thing you got?
C: WAYNE
D: At the moment. You interested?
S: EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Randy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost thinking of leaving.
C: CASSIDY
D: Hey.
E: O.S.
N: Randy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees.
C: RANDY
D: Hey.
N: RANDY'S POV: It's his first time seeing Cassidy in street clothes and in daylight. She's not wearing makeup, and her hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three inches shorter out of her stripper heels. They shake hands, a bit awkwardly.
C: RANDY
D: I almost didn't recognize you. You look all... clean.
E: CONT'D
C: CASSIDY
D: "Clean"?
C: RANDY
D: Like classy.
C: CASSIDY
D: Gee, thanks.
C: RANDY
D: Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I like it. It's like in "Grease", where she turns into the hot rock `n' roll chick at the end. Except backwards.
E: BEAT
C: CASSIDY
D: Oh-kaay...
N: Randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels he's used to.
C: RANDY
D: So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy or Pam?
N: She gives the question genuine thought.
C: CASSIDY
D: Pam. But don't get used to it.
E: playful finger wag
S: INT. YESTERDAZE - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy follows Cassidy toward the back of the store. He looks around, taking in the array of funky `50s/'60s/'70s clothes.
C: RANDY
D: This is awesome... (rubs hands together,
C: PSYCHED)
D: We are gonna find something great!
N: Cassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall, she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts, pants, etc. She starts sifting through.
C: CASSIDY
D: Do you know her size?
C: RANDY
D: She's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you.
N: Cassidy spots a fun, multi-color MINI-SKIRT. She pulls it out.
C: CASSIDY
D: Could you see her in this?
C: RANDY
D: Maybe. Not really. I'm not sure.
E: BEAT BEAT
N: Cassidy tosses it back in. She unearths a Flashdance-style SWEATSHIRT.
C: CASSIDY
D: What about this?
N: Randy makes a sour face. She tosses it back.
C: CASSIDY
D: So like, what is she? Goth? Punk? Hippie? Preppy? Stoner?
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: Randy ponders the choices.
C: RANDY
D: Not really...
N: Cassidy lets out a good-natured groan of frustration. Randy watches as she continues searching.
C: RANDY
D: Hey, Pam?
E: CONT'D
C: CASSIDY
D: Yeah?
C: RANDY
D: Thank you very much.
N: Cassidy looks at him. She can feel his sincere appreciation.
C: CASSIDY
D: You're welcome.
N: She returns to searching. Sift, sift, sift, sift...
C: RANDY
D: I think she might be a lesbian.
N: Cassidy stops sifting. She looks up at him.
C: RANDY
D: Does that help?
E: CONT'D
N: Cassidy leads Randy by the arm over to the... MEN'S AREA: Cassidy heads to a RACK OF CLOTHES. She quickly zeroes in on a RETRO BOWLING SHIRT. She holds it up to Randy, who makes a scrunched-up face.
C: RANDY
D: Ah, maybe she's just a friend.
N: Cassidy puts the bowling shirt back. As she does, something catches Randy's eye.
C: RANDY
D: What's that? The green.
E: CONT'D POINTING
N: Cassidy holds up the item for Randy.
C: CASSIDY
D: This?
E: SURPRISED
N: An excited look comes over Randy's face.
C: RANDY
D: It's perfect.
N: RANDY'S POV: A satin-green ROLLER-DISCO JACKET. Embroidered on the left breast is a big "S" in purple script. It's UGLY. Cassidy looks at the jacket. She clearly finds it awful. She looks at Randy, who's beaming with excitement and pride. She finds it very endearing.
C: CASSIDY
D: I agree.
S: EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Yesterdaze bag in hand, Randy opens the door to his van. He and tosses the bag inside. He's on a post-shop high, mission accomplished.
C: RANDY
D: Thanks again.
C: CASSIDY
D: You found it.
C: RANDY
D: I never woulda known about this place.
C: CASSIDY
D: Okay, I'll give you that.
N: A tentative pause. Cassidy looks at him, ready to part ways.
C: CASSIDY
D: Look, I...
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: Man, I worked up a pretty good thirst in there. What say we grab a beer?
C: CASSIDY
D: I gotta get going.
C: RANDY
D: One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
N: Cassidy seems torn.
C: CASSIDY
D: I really can't. I got a kid at home.
E: BEAT
C: RANDY
D: You have a kid?
N: Cassidy nods. Yup.
C: RANDY
D: I had no idea.
E: CONT'D
N: Cassidy shrugs casually.
C: RANDY
D: Boy or girl?
E: CONT'D
C: CASSIDY
D: Boy. Daniel.
C: RANDY
D: How old?
C: CASSIDY
D: Nine.
C: RANDY
D: Wow... I had no friggin' idea.
C: CASSIDY
D: It's not something I usually tell customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
N: Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him.
C: RANDY
D: Wait.
N: He unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly, excitedly holds it out to Cassidy.
C: RANDY
D: Now both our kids got something.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it.
C: RANDY
D: You're gonna turn this down, too? Man, you're rough!
E: CONT'D
N: Cassidy chuckles a little. She takes it.
C: CASSIDY
D: That's very nice of you. Thank you.
C: RANDY
D: Tell him to take good care of that. $300 bucks on eBay.
C: CASSIDY
D: Really?
C: RANDY
D: Nah.
N: Cassidy laughs a little. She can't help but be charmed by his sweetness and earnestness. After a pause...
C: CASSIDY
D: One beer.
S: INT. LOCAL BAR - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Randy and Cassidy are having beers at the bar. He's holding her CELLPHONE, looking at PICTURES of her son. He moves on to the next one.
C: RANDY
D: He's a good-lookin' kid.
C: CASSIDY
D: I think so.
C: RANDY
D: I see where he gets it from.
N: Cassidy smiles, flattered.
C: CASSIDY
D: He sure doesn't get it from his douchebag father.
N: Randy skips to the next pic. It's a shot of an UNDER- CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING.
C: RANDY
D: What's that?
C: CASSIDY
D: Just this condo thing, down by Trenton.
C: RANDY
D: You moving there?
C: CASSIDY
D: Working on it. It's a great area. Way cheaper. And the schools are awesome.
E: BEAT

N: MUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - "POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME" Randy's ears perk up at the song on the jukebox.
C: RANDY
D: Hell, yeah.
E: CONT'D
N: He stands up, reaching out for Cassidy's hand. She doesn't give it.
C: RANDY
D: C'mon. Let's dance.
E: CONT'D
C: CASSIDY
D: Where?
C: RANDY
D: Right here.
C: CASSIDY

C: RANDY
D: Who cares? Fuckin' Def Lep!
C: CASSIDY
D: I've danced to this plenty.
E: CHUCKLES
C: RANDY
D: Fine. Then I'm dancing for you.
N: Randy starts DANCING in front of Cassidy, who's sitting on a barstool. She smiles.
C: CASSIDY
D: Is this a lapdance I'm getting?
N: Randy goes into lapdance mode, "seductively" writhing for her, silly and self-aware.
C: RANDY
D: Just sit back and enjoy.
N: He turns around, wiggling his ass a little for her. He runs his hands up and down her sides. He drapes his long blond mane over her shoulders, running it over her face. She laughs, charmed and amused. He gazes into her eyes intensely.
C: RANDY
D: The lapdancer has become the lapdanced.
E: CONT'D
N: Cassidy laughs. He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed.
C: CASSIDY
D: I think we can get you a shift.
N: Randy bobs his head along to the kick-ass Def Leppard tune, really loving it. The song builds to its chorus. Randy SINGS ALONG.

N: Cassidy, unable to resist the call of the Lep, joins in.

E: pointing at each other eye contact, sultry
N: From here, the song veers off into a GUITAR PART. Randy nods along, savoring the awesome hair-metal riffing.

D: "I'm from Seattle! I like rain!"
N: Randy shakes his head sourly.
C: RANDY
D: Nineties fuckin' sucked.
C: CASSIDY
D: No shit...
N: Their EYES MEET. A moment of CHEMISTRY. Mutual attraction. Randy moves closer, his eyes locked on hers. He leans in for... a KISS. They MAKE OUT for a few seconds. Cassidy PULLS BACK. She gives Randy a playfully scolding FINGER WAG, masking her fear and discomfort with what just happened.
C: CASSIDY
D: No contact with the customers.
E: CONT'D
C: RANDY
D: You're right. My bad.
N: He keeps right on dancing, totally unaware of the shift that just occurred in her.

D: What's up?
C: CASSIDY
D: I totally didn't realize the time.
E: glancing at watch
C: RANDY
D: We just got here.
C: CASSIDY
D: I should get home.
N: She stands up. Randy is very disappointed.
C: RANDY
D: C'mon. You said one beer!
N: Randy points toward her ALMOST-FULL BEER on the bar. She picks it up and CHUGS the whole thing. She slaps the empty bottle on the bar.
C: CASSIDY
D: Good night.
N: She gives him an arm pat and walks out of the bar. Randy is impressed.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SHOP-RITE - EMPLOYEE ROOM - MORNING
N: It's Randy's first day of work. He slips into a DELI COAT. Tucks his hair into a hairnet. Pulls a Shop-Rite baseball cap over the hairnet. He walks over to a mirror to see how he looks in his new uniform. He feels a little silly.
C: WAYNE
D: Here ya go.
E: O.S.
N: He turns and sees Wayne, who hands him something. Randy looks at the item in his hand, vaguely bothered.
C: RANDY
D: I thought it was gonna say Randy.
N: ANGLE ON item, a Shop-Rite NAME TAG. The name on it is ROBIN.
C: WAYNE
D: Guess they got it off your W-4.

C: RANDY
D: Yeah, but I----
C: WAYNE
D: Then yes.
C: RANDY
D: Could they maybe re-do it?
C: WAYNE
D: Just wear the fucking thing.
N: Wayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He takes another look in the mirror, sighing unhappily. Randy looks up at the employee-room clock. It's 8:59 AM. He heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli counter. Standing before the curtain, he pauses a moment, gathering himself like before a wrestling match. He steps through. Showtime.
S: INT. DELI COUNTER - DAY
N: About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the deli counter with Take-A-Number tickets. Randy, manning the counter, hands an OLD GUY in a WWII VETERAN baseball cap a packet of roast beef. The guy shuffles off. Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign.
C: RANDY
D: Seventeen.
N: A WOMAN (60s) steps forward holding a 17 and a SHOP-RITE CIRCULAR. She carefully surveys the TURKEY-BREAST SELECTION in the case.

N: Randy looks clueless.
C: WOMAN
D: It's a little unclear.
E: CONT'D holding up circular
N: She hands the circular to Randy to take a look. RANDY'S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB. He still has no idea.
C: WOMAN
D: I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if it's full price...
E: CONT'D
N: Randy briefly catches eyes with another customer, a BIG- HAIRED, SEMI-HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of woman Randy would hit on in a bar. He dodges her eye contact, embarrassed by the context.
C: RANDY
D: Hang on, let me...
E: to circular lady
N: Randy picks up a phone behind the counter.
C: RANDY
D: (into phone, over
E: CONT'D

E: CONT'D
N: The woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again.
C: WOMAN
D: Which in your opinion is the best smoked ham?

C: RANDY
D: Sure.
N: Randy grabs a plastic container.
C: RANDY
D: Pesto change-o.

C: RANDY
D: Wow. I am good.
E: CONT'D
N: This gets Randy a small chuckle from the woman. Randy slaps a price tag on the container.
C: RANDY
D: Can I get you anything else?
E: CONT'D
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: Nope. That's it.
N: He hands her the container.
C: RANDY

C: RANDY
D: Do stalkers bring presents?
C: STEPHANIE
D: Sometimes.

C: RANDY
D: You really don't remember?
C: STEPHANIE
D: No.

S: EXT. BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER

N: Stephanie nods.
C: RANDY
D: My priorities were all fucked up. I know that. But now... I wanna try to make things right. I wanna try to get to know you. I just hope it's not too late.
E: CONT'D lump in throat

Salivating almost. More punches. More cheers. Bodies crash loudly against the mat. Randy's temptation grows with each shot. He can't resist any longer. He... JUMPS IN. Randy pushes Booker D out of the way. He's SMASHED IN THE FACE by a McPride-swung folding chair meant for Booker D. Randy goes down. A TRACE OF A SMILE is visible on his face.

Any year now... Randy keeps right on slicing at his unhurried pace. He gets in a nice, meditative groove. Slice, slice, slice, slice, slice... He watches as his thumb inches closer to the spinning blade. He stares at his thumb. At the blade. His thumb. He JAMS HIS THUMB INTO THE BLADE. Blood squirts everywhere. On his coat. On the deli meat. Randy stares at the DEEP GASH, watching as blood pulses out in crimson surges. He smiles strangely at it. A customer GASPS. A commotion quickly spreads.

D: Bye, monkey...
N: She is struck by what she sees. CASSIDY'S POV: DANIEL (9) is on the floor, playing with the Randy The Ram doll. She watches as he makes the Randy doll climb up the couch's armrest.

Next to the table is a VIDEOCAMERA on a tripod. COMMENTATOR #1 There he is, folks! Randy The Ram! Randy raises a set of ram's horns high in the air. Fans do the same in tribute. COMMENTATOR #2 History about to be made here at the Greenville Civic Auditorium. Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after chair. His head gets a little bloody. The fans eat it up. Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits. The cheers continue. Loving, appreciative, sustained cheers. Randy stands there soaking it in, basking in their love. He grabs the microphone from the ring announcer. He looks around. A hush comes over the crowd.
C: RANDY
D: I just got one thing to say to you people...
N: Randy looks toward Cassidy, standing over by the entrance curtain. He looks out at the larger crowd.
C: RANDY
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D
N: LOUD CHEERS. Randy takes a contemplative pause.
C: RANDY
D: You take your lumps and bruises in this game. But you know what? It's all worth it. Because of you guys. Your cheers keep me young. They make me feel alive. In 1982, the year I wrestled my first professional match, I was six- foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot- eleven. Three back surgeries in 11 years knocked two full inches off my height. I may be down to five- eleven, but performing in front of you people has always made me feel 10 feet tall. And that's the way it's always gonna be.

The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up and grabs The Ayatollah. The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.
C: RANDY
D: You're workin' pretty light here.
E: CONT'D under breath
N: Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The Ayatollah's face into the canvas.
C: THE AYATOLLAH
D: Jesus. Relax.
N: Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his shoulder blades. The REF swoops in.
C: REFEREE
D: One!... Two!...
N: The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.
C: RANDY
D: Anytime you wanna join in.
N: Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him with a FLYING ELBOW DROP. The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment. Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him. ENTRANCE CURTAIN: Cassidy is cringing. It's hard for her to watch this. THE RING:
C: THE AYATOLLAH
D: That better?
C: RANDY
D: Much.
N: The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee. Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah falls on top of him.
C: THE AYATOLLAH
D: Forgot how much fun this is.
N: The ref swoops in.
C: REFEREE
D: One!... Two!...
N: Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy "recovers", The Ayatollah jumps out of the ring and grabs a folding chair. The Ayatollah, climbing back in, props up the chair in a corner. He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and OUT OF THE RING. He hits the concrete floor, CRASHING against the metal barricade. ENTRANCE CURTAIN: Cassidy winces. She starts to tear up a little. THE RING: The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy, kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it tauntingly at the crowd. FAN #1 (O.S.) FAN #2 (O.S.) Camelfucker! Fat piece of shit! The Ayatollah looks down at Randy.
C: THE AYATOLLAH
D: Pathetic. Pitiful godless infidel!
E: "spits" on Randy
N: THE CROWD: Boos rain down on The Ayatollah. JUST OUTSIDE RING: The Ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and JABS IT into Randy's side. Randy grimaces in pain. The Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT around Randy's neck. He JERKS UPWARD on the flag, lifting Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND, fighting for breath. The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy by his hair and flings him back in the ring. THE RING: The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat. ENTRANCE CURTAIN: Cassidy, alarmed, instinctively goes halfway toward the ring.
C: CASSIDY
D: Randy!

N: Randy turns back to The Ayatollah.
C: RANDY
D: It's time.
C: THE AYATOLLAH
D: All you, bro. Lead the way.
N: Randy flips The Ayatollah over. Randy struggles to his feet. He picks up The Ayatollah and levels him with a dropkick. COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) Dropkick! (a second one) And another! (a third one) And another! His heart is POUNDING. The fans sense it's near the end. A chant rises:
C: CROWD
D: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
E: O.S.
N: Randy falls on top of The Ayatollah, putting him in a rest- move headlock.
C: CROWD
D: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.) Just listen to this crowd! The Ayatollah can hear how labored Randy's breathing is.
C: THE AYATOLLAH
D: If you ain't up to it...
C: CROWD
D: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
E: O.S.
N: Randy looks around at the crowd, chanting, hungry for the Ram Jam. He looks The Ayatollah in the eye.
C: RANDY
D: Let's do this.
N: Randy gets up. He lifts The Ayatollah off the mat, locking up with him chest-to-chest. He arches his back and thrusts his hips. The Ayatollah's feet fly off the canvas as his legs whip into the air. His body does a COMPLETE FLIP as he slams onto his back. Randy stays with him, his body contorting in a tight BACK FLIP as he CRASHES DOWN on top of him. COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) Lateral drop! Randy gets up. His HEART LURCHES. He lowers himself back down to his knees. Puts his hand to his chest. Something just happened. Randy looks out at the crowd. The whole place is on its feet.
C: CROWD
D: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
E: O.S.
N: Randy's heart LURCHES AGAIN.
C: THE AYATOLLAH

E: O.S.
C: THE AYATOLLAH
D: Finish it. Pin me.
E: O.S.
N: Randy is torn. He... GETS UP. Randy STAGGERS to the corner. His heartbeat is UNNATURAL AND DEAFENING. BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM... ON CASSIDY: Cassidy can't take any more. She turns and WALKS. ON RANDY: Randy plants a foot on the bottom rope. He looks toward Cassidy. RANDY'S POV: He catches a glimpse of Cassidy disappearing through the curtain into the locker room. Randy looks out on the crowd. Chanting, cheering. He starts to climb. Standing on the top rope, he looks again at the curtain. She's gone. HALLWAY: Cassidy exits the arena sobbing. THE RING: The Ayatollah lies on the ground in pain. ON RANDY: Randy raises his arms and sticks his elbows out, pressing his fists to the sides of his head to form a set of RAM'S HORNS. COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.) Uh-oh, the horns are out... Randy takes a long look around the auditorium, lingering on the fans' faces, savoring their cheers. He SMILES. COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) Here we go... BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM... He LEAPS. FREEZE on Randy in mid-air, glorious and immortal. THE END
