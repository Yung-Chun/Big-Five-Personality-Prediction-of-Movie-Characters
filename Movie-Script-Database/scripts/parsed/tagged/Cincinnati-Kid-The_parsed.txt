M: THE CINCINNATI KID
M: Written by
M: Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern
M: Based on a novel by
M: Richard Jessup
M: SHOOTING DRAFT - 1965
M: FADE IN: SERIES OF ESTABLISHING SHOTS - DAY
N: Exterior scenes of St. Louis, particularly the riverside industrial district. Even more important to establish than the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes as "Burst the Roosevelt Bubble," "Save the American Way of Life," "Vote for Landon and Knox."
S: EXT. FACTORY - DAY
N: One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.
S: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
N: A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, dirty and noisy.
S: INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD
N: The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.
C: DEALER
D: Somebody shut the goddam window. Let a man think.
N: The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid have almost all the money on the table between them, about a hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are left in the hand.
C: DEALER
D: Possible straight gets a -- -- lovely little four.
E: deals the card
C: FIRST PLAYER
D: On the last hand even, you couldn't give me a break.
C: DEALER
D: I put the brakes on your straight, didn't I? There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce.
E: he laughs; no one else does; he deals to The Kid
C: KID
D: Thanks.
C: DEALER
D: And our lucky friend from Chicago gets a queen with his pair of sixes. Little lady make you happy, Buster?
E: deals to Danny
C: DANNY
D: Deal to yourself, clown.
C: DEALER
D: Dealer gives himself a -- I might have known. Bet your sixes, Buster.
E: deals card and groans to Danny
C: DANNY
D: I told you not to call me that. Cost you -- Ninety-four bucks.
E: then as the dealer turns away counts out his money
C: DEALER
D: Biggest pot of the whole game, I got to drop.
C: DANNY
D: Interested?
E: to First Player
C: FIRST PLAYER
D: Wouldn't call you if I had a pair higher'n sixes. Which I ain't.
N: He turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid.
C: KID
D: Don't seem like he'd bet out without something better than the sixes, does it? Cost me every cent I've won since yesterday afternoon. But I tell you, I got this stubborn streak. Call the ninety-four dollars.
E: fingers hole card as if to fold studies Danny's face
N: He counts out the money, which is almost all he has.
C: DANNY
D: You can't have better than a pair of kings!
E: indignantly
C: KID
D: Oh, I'm not claiming anything that fine. Just enough to beat the pair of sixes.
E: turns over an eight, making a pair of them
C: DANNY
D: You seen my hole card, you bastard! He was dealing them high.
E: indicating Dealer
N: Attending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely in the face.
C: DANNY
D: You stole that dough.
C: KID
D: You better watch those loose lips of yours, you want to have any teeth left behind them -- Buster.
N: He stands up.
C: DANNY
D: You wouldn't of shelled out ninety- four bucks --
C: KID
D: I called you on account of I didn't think you had another pair or another six and I know a punk like you would get greedy and try and buy the last hand.
N: He walks off, disappearing through a door marked "MEN."
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - THE KID AT MIRROR
N: He is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears, his right hand in his coat pocket. The Kid's hand goes to his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves the razor blade against his neck.
C: KID
D: Drop it.
N: As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles his way out through a window. SUPERIMPOSE: MAIN TITLES Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to get out of the building and after The Kid.
S: EXT. ALLEY BACK OF RESTAURANT - DAY
N: The conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on. The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to run toward the railroad yards. A few moments later, Danny and four other poker players appear and run after him.
S: EXT. RAILROAD YARDS - DAY
N: The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits. The Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the train into the depot.
S: INT. UNION STATION, ST. LOUIS
N: The train slowly stops. Amid all the atmosphere of arrival in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in travel, LANCEY HODGES appears on a platform, takes his bag from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before he has descended the steps. He walks with other passengers and Red Caps toward the center of the station.
S: EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
N: Shooting through the Meeting of the Rivers fountain across Market Street to the Romanesque building with its campanile.
S: EXT. UNION STATION - TAXI STAND - DAY
N: Lancey getting into a taxi. THE CREDITS END
S: INT. TAXI - PROCESS - DAY
N: Lancey sits in serene repose in back, watching the sights go by. The HACKIE steals a couple of looks at him in the rear vision mirror.
C: HACKIE
D: What you looking for, mister?
C: LANCEY
D: Do I have to be looking for something?
C: HACKIE
D: I can pretty much tell.
C: LANCEY
D: You can pretty much tell what?
C: HACKIE
D: Some guys come to town, I can tell if they're looking for something.
C: LANCEY
D: What do you think I'm looking for?
C: HACKIE
D: If you're looking for girls, I can fix you up.
C: LANCEY
D: I strongly doubt if you could fix me up. In that department.
C: HACKIE
D: Well what are you looking for?
C: LANCEY
D: You're looking for a clout in the head if you don't keep your face to the road.
S: EXT. PLUSH HOTEL - TAXI STAND - DAY
N: A doorman takes Lancey's suitcase as Lancey pays the Hackie and walks into the hotel. A SECOND HACKIE whose cab is at the curb reacts to seeing Lancey and steps forward.
C: SECOND HACKIE
D: Hey, you know who that is?
C: HACKIE
D: No. Who?
N: But the second hackie has followed Lancey into the hotel.
S: INT. LOBBY OF PLUSH HOTEL
N: Lancey crosses to the desk to register as the Second Hackie goes to a row of phone booths and enters one. He dials with his eyes on Lancey registering.
C: SECOND HACKIE
D: Shorty? Want to hear who just checked into the Park Sherman... Yes, you do. Lancey Hodges.
E: into phone
S: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - ATTENDANT
N: He is talking on the phone while he hands out score sheets and shoes to some bowlers. He is just as excited by the report as the Hackie is.
C: ATTENDANT
D: The Kid know?
S: INT. BAR - FEATURING THE BARTENDER
N: He is talking on the telephone behind the bar.
C: BARTENDER
D: Somebody sure as hell ought to tell The Kid. Lancey Hodges is in town.
E: hangs up
S: INT. BAR - CLOSE SHOT - DRINKING MAN
N: He reacts to the news in a big way. CAMERA PANS to another DRINKING MAN, who is equally impressed. They exchange looks.
C: FIRST DRINKING MAN
D: Kid's been laying for him a long time.
S: INT. BARBER SHOP - BARBER AND CUSTOMER
C: BARBER
D: You ask me, The Kid'll go after him as soon as he hears.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Who's got a better right?
S: INT. HOBAN'S POOL ROOM - HOBAN AND THE SHOOTER
N: We are in the front room where the pool tables are. Through an open door in b.g., we can see the unadvertised but unconcealed other activity of the establishment: a poker game in progress.
C: HOBAN
D: You going to tell The Kid, Shooter?
C: SHOOTER
D: Hell, I can't not tell him.
C: HOBAN
D: It's where he's been headed for years.
N: The Kid enters the place through the front door, still a little dishevelled from his escape.
C: KID
D: Hey!
E: in greeting
C: HOBAN
D: What you say, Kid?
C: KID
D: Hey, Hoban.
C: SHOOTER
D: Where you been? Boys been holding a chair for you in back.
C: KID
D: Business opportunity come along. Something too good to pass up.
C: SHOOTER
D: Turn a profit?
C: KID
D: Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had it took back.
C: HOBAN
D: Oh, one of those.
C: SHOOTER
D: You been in too many rough ones lately, Kid. You can't go on forever, coming out in one piece.
E: concerned
C: KID
D: I got to build my stake, Aren't enough chances in this town to let one go.
C: HOBAN
D: You're too good, that's your trouble. People who know you're the Cincinnati Kid, they don't want to sit down with you --
C: KID
D: For nickels and dimes... Thing is I've about used up St. Louis.
C: SHOOTER
D: The streets are getting full of guys you've hustled.
E: nodding
C: KID
D: Been thinking about Miami. There's nothing to keep me here.
C: SHOOTER
D: The hell there isn't Lancey Hodges' in town.
E: after a moment as the Kid looks at him
C: KID
D: Yeah? The Man himself, here in St. Louis -- I might just stick around Shooter.
E: then
S: INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM
N: Lancey is on the phone, sitting on the bed.
C: LANCEY
D: Mr. Schlaegel? How are you? And your enchanting wife?... Tomorrow is quite convenient... I generally prefer stud but you name it... Your stakes are my pleasure, sir... Thank you, why don't we make it after lunch? My diet these days is enough to spoil anyone else's appetite... A pleasure, sir. Please remember me to your charming wife.
E: into phone
N: He hangs up and some of the strength seems to go out of him, as if he had been through too long a sustained effort. His eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply.
S: EXT. HAROLD STREET - DAY
N: Harold Street leads to the river and we follow The Kid and The Shooter as they walk down it in the gathering dusk.
C: SHOOTER
D: I been seeing it coming for a long time, Kid. Long time.
E: lighting a cigar
C: KID
D: I ain't exactly been hiding it.
C: SHOOTER
D: No, you ain't been hiding it.
C: KID
D: Well I got to know.
C: SHOOTER
D: Sure, you got to know. We all got to know.
C: KID
D: Sometime or other we got to find out how much juice we got.
C: SHOOTER
D: That's why I had to tell you.
C: KID
D: You ever sit down with him?
C: SHOOTER
D: Yes, I have.
N: They walk along, The Shooter pursing his lips thoughtfully.
C: KID
D: Well, what happened?
C: SHOOTER
D: Nothing. Nothing at all.
C: KID
D: You lost.
C: SHOOTER
D: I didn't lose. I'm too good to lose when I set my mind to it. I play poker a certain way, Kid. I've had my Lancey Hodges. Only with me it was Whistling Sam Magee to New Orleans.
C: KID
D: I heard about him.
E: respectfully
C: SHOOTER
D: Well then you know it all... about 20 years ago it was, maybe more.
C: KID
D: What happened?
C: SHOOTER
D: Why, I lost it. It dried me up on the inside for a long, a very long time.
C: KID
D: Yeah?
C: SHOOTER
D: I been where I'm going, know what I mean?
N: The Kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends into the river. Along the river bank can be seen a small portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and down the Mississippi.
S: EXT. PIER
N: They walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at the river, watching the working boats. They have their thoughts; The Shooter smoking his cigar.
C: KID
D: You think I'm ready?
C: SHOOTER
D: Kid, I don't think you're ready.
E: after some time, several seconds of thoughtful puffing
C: KID
D: Oh.
E: quickly
C: SHOOTER
D: But you're not going to take my word for it, are you? Are you now?
C: KID
D: No, I ain't. I can't.
C: SHOOTER
D: I know, I know. You got to find out for yourself.
C: KID
D: I don't figure to take him right away. But if I can hang in there long enough, I can outlast him. If I can outlast him, I got a chance. You admit that, don't you, that I got a chance?
C: SHOOTER
D: I already said I didn't think you were ready.
C: KID
D: Did you think you were ready when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee?
C: SHOOTER
D: Kid, I thought I was the best stud poker player in the world. I'm telling you now, I thought I was the best.
C: KID
D: Well, I don't think I'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards. I got something.
C: SHOOTER
D: No, you ain't no cocky square. And you probably got something.
C: KID
D: Okay. And I ain't saying that you was either when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee.
C: SHOOTER
D: If you got the stuff, being a little cocky don't hurt you none.
C: KID
D: Well, would you say if I got any chance at all?
C: SHOOTER
D: This much of a chance. If Lancey is not right. If he's got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or something like that.
C: KID
D: But then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing. Listen, we got to have it understood. If he's not right, we call it off till he is.
C: SHOOTER
D: You're set on a real showdown, aren't you? Your mind's all made up.
N: They start back off the pier.
C: KID
D: I got to. You said yourself I got to. I'm overdue.
C: SHOOTER
D: Yeah, you been around a long time -- I was a lot younger than you when I went up against Whistling Sam -- But you'd be kinda young too, to be The Man.
C: KID
D: I gotta find out.
C: SHOOTER
D: Want me to set it up?
E: after a pause
C: KID
D: I wish you would, Shooter Man.
E: gratefully
C: SHOOTER
D: All right.
C: KID
D: Hey, what if he turns me down?
C: SHOOTER
D: He won't, the way I'll spread the word. He'll have to take you on, someone in your class. If he ducked it, that'd make you The Man.
C: KID
D: You think he knows I'm around?
C: SHOOTER
D: He can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river. He knows you're around and he'll sit down with you. You want to butt heads with The Man, I'll set it up.
N: Ahead, on the levee, CHRISTIAN is seen waiting for The Kid. She has not yet seen them as they approach off the pier.
C: SHOOTER
D: There's your woman.
C: KID
D: I wouldn't want to wait around too long. I want to get in and get it over with.
C: SHOOTER
D: He must of come to St. Louis for a big money game. I'll probably get asked do I want to deal it for them. And however long that takes, he'll have to rest up for you.
C: KID
D: Oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar, I can understand that. Sure.
C: SHOOTER
D: You got much of a stake?
C: KID
D: Close to three grand.
C: SHOOTER
D: Work on it. But three grand will give you a ride and even if you don't win, why you'll come away with a good idea of what you're made of. But once you go in Kid you can't quit. You get that straight right now. Two of you go in and only one of you can come out.
N: Christian sees them and moves toward them.
C: KID
D: Well, school's out. I damn sure don't want no lessons. I want everything he's got.
C: SHOOTER
D: It's the only way to be, Kid.
N: Shooter turns away abruptly as Christian arrives, giving her a brief nod.
C: SHOOTER
D: See you.
N: The Kid takes Christian's arm automatically; he watches The Shooter walk way down Harold Street. He and Christian head in another direction. She is humming a mountain tune.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: When we leaving town, Kid? This week?
C: KID
D: No, I won't be ready. Not for a while.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I thought --
C: KID
D: Might even turn out we don't go.
N: She is surprised by this and, in her own hesitant way, curious.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You must feel different about it than you did Saturday.
N: He looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey. But it is too sharp a break with tradition.
C: KID
D: Yeah, I'm feeling a little different.
E: TIME LAPSE
S: INT. KID'S BEDROOM
N: It is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue. In f.g. The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. He opens his eyes and turns to look at her. The movement catches her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid the noise has disturbed him.
C: KID
D: It's all right. You don't have to act like a cat. You're not bothering me.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You want me to turn out the light?
C: KID
D: No. I'm overtired, that's why I can't sleep. Why can't you sleep?
E: sits up and swings his feet to the floor
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Undertired, I guess. If a person rests all day, she doesn't have much to rest up from at night. Why don't you have a nice hot bath? I could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath, and then maybe you could sleep.
E: lightly stands up
N: She waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision.
C: KID
D: 'Kay. Can't hurt to try it.
N: She goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on gently so the tub will take a long while to fill. Then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it. She stands in front of him waiting for him to move, but The Kid is singularly listless. Not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow. She goes right to work on his shoulder muscles, and she seems to know what she is doing.
C: KID
D: What did you do with yourself this time?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Last night I went to a movie with The Shooter's woman. French movie.
C: KID
D: In French?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: They had the words in English at the bottom of the picture. But The Shooter's woman knew what they were saying without it. Pig's woman or somebody told me she went to college.
C: KID
D: Sure. Majored in man-eating.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I think maybe she really did go. But I never quite dared to up and ask her.
C: KID
D: I didn't know you ran with The Shooter's woman.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: We got to be kind of friendly when you both were in that three-day game down to Cairo. 'Course she's older'n me.
C: KID
D: And been around more. A lot more. What was the movie like?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Weird. It wasn't a straight story where you knew whose side you were on, the way you do in regular pictures.
C: KID
D: American pictures.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Yeah. There were lots of things I didn't understand.
C: KID
D: What was it about?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Well, there's this town in Europe a long time ago where they get a message from a Spanish general he's coming to spend the night with his troops. So all the men are scared silly about what the soldiers will do to them.
C: KID
D: Nothing weird about that.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: But all the wives and daughters tell the men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy.
C: KID
D: That don't make much sense.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Wait. The way they handle it is they go to bed with the Spaniards. And the next morning the soldiers go off peacefully and everybody's happy.
C: KID
D: Including the husbands and fathers? Don't they suspect?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That's part of what I wasn't sure of. I guess they know what went on but they care more about their safety and their money than they do about their honor.
C: KID
D: Then they got their heads screwed on straight. Honor's just an idea. You can't see or feel it and you can't eat it and you sure as hell can't get any mileage on it.
N: She slaps him on the rump and straightens up.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I'll just turn off the bath water.
N: He doesn't move but just stays relaxed and closes his eyes.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Christian, humming softly, turns off the water, takes a large towel from a rack and puts it on a stool by the tub where it will be more convenient for him. She lingers to test the water with her finger and do anything else she can think of to assure maximum comfort for her man. Then she steps back into the bedroom. The sight of him makes her advance cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep.
S: INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT
N: MELBA, The Shooter's woman, is sitting up in bed working on her eyebrows and listening to MUSIC turned up LOUD on a radio. The bedside phone RINGS, barely audible above the radio. She answers it.
C: MELBA
D: Hello... Yes, it is. You want him? Shooter! Telephone! Shooter!
E: into phone calling
N: She gets no answer, which is no wonder in view of the noise from the radio. But the radio is across the room and it's slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed she's on, and go to the door of The Shooter's room. She opens this and we see The Shooter in bed in his own small quarters, reading a magazine. He turns around inquiringly.
C: MELBA
D: Phone for you. I always seem to be the one to answer it, no matter who it's for.
C: SHOOTER
D: If you'd rather we put it in my room --
E: getting up
C: MELBA
D: Are you kidding?
N: The Shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks into it, he pantomimes to her that he won't be able to hear over the radio. She seems to regard the request as an imposition but she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore.
C: SHOOTER
D: Hello?... Well, hello. What brings you to our fair city? Little action, maybe?
E: into phone
S: INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM
N: Lancey, dressed for bed, is on the phone.
C: LANCEY
D: How could you guess, Shooter? I was invited by a Mr. William Schlaegel --
E: into phone
S: INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT
C: SHOOTER
D: Owns most of the Schlaegel Brewery. Braumeister beer.
E: into phone
N: The Shooter sits down on the edge of Melba's bed, the movement jostling her so she pricks herself with her tweezers. She exclaims in protest and gives him a dirty look that makes The Shooter stand right up again.
S: INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM
C: LANCEY
D: As he put it, rather bluntly, I felt, we don't want everyone to have to watch everyone else dealing to see to it they don't make any little accidental errors by mistake. I told him a man couldn't ask for a better guarantee of a fair-and-square game than having The Shooter deal it. So if you're willing, we're meeting at two o'clock in the afternoon. Ask for Mr. Schlaegel's suite at the Park Sherman... Good. I'm glad you can do it, Shooter. Be a pleasure to see you again... Oh pretty much the same... Just have to be a little careful about smoking and drinking and eating -- and breathing. See you tomorrow. Good night.
E: into phone then
N: He hangs up the phone, settles himself in a comfortable chair, and opens a heavy book. CAMERA MOVES in CLOSE enough to reveal the title: Prescott's CONQUEST OF PERU.
S: INT. KID'S APARTMENT
N: It is midday outside but the window shades are tightly drawn to keep the daylight from disturbing The Kid, who is still asleep. Christian, dressed for the street, moves from the bedroom to the kitchen-living room which is the remainder of the two-room apartment. Finding paper and pencil, she writes a quick note and leaves it on the kitchen table, then starts out. (TIME LAPSE)
S: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW - DAY
N: featuring one bathing suit displayed among others in an end- of-season sale with some such advertising message as "All bathing suits reduced 1/3 for clearance!" The particular suit is a two-piece one, exposing two or three inches of bare midriff -- the first modest forerunner of the trend that led eventually to the bikini.
C: CHRISTIAN'S VOICE
D: Would you wear it in public?
E: O.S.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Christian and Melba looking at the display.
C: MELBA
D: Wouldn't be much point wearing it in private. Sure, why not, as long as you don't have a bulge to hide?
N: They start walking.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I don't know, Melba.
C: MELBA
D: My guess is there isn't anything about you needs hiding. But I'll give you a more definitive opinion at the bath.
E: looking her over
C: CHRISTIAN
D: At the what?
E: startled
C: MELBA
D: Turkish Bath. After we're through shopping. I'm treating you, Christian.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I never been. I'm not even sure what you do.
C: MELBA
D: You don't do anything. That's what's so marvelous. They do it to you.
N: (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. STEAM ROOM
N: CAMERA finds Christian and Melba among the perspiring females.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: The third time I stayed. Never went back to the boarding house except to pick up my things.
C: MELBA
D: And that side of it's held up? No complaints in the bed department?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Well, just one.
C: MELBA
D: Yes?
E: intrigued
C: CHRISTIAN
D: The nights he isn't there.
C: MELBA
D: He really does that to you, does he? You got one of the rare ones.
N: (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. MASSAGE ROOM
N: Christian and Melba are on adjoining rubbing tables, a curtain separating them from the waist down only. Their heads are close enough so they can talk without their masseurs necessarily hearing every word they say.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You find a guy, you love him, and that's it. It's supposed to just go on like that for life. Right?
C: MELBA
D: According to the propaganda, right.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: But it isn't my life, it's his life, with me tacked on. You have any idea what it's like to be a hash slinger in a cheap restaurant?
C: MELBA
D: No, honey, the stock crash wafted me right from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It's hell, if you'll excuse the word. But I didn't want to quit. The Kid made me. I felt I ought to hang on to something that was me away from him. You know what I mean?
C: MELBA
D: Sure. Some girls solve the problem by taking on an extra guy.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I'm serious. Having children might take care of it, I don't know. Or -- this is really a terrible thing to admit.
C: MELBA
D: Your most sordid secrets are safe with me. Confess.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: If he was rich, or famous --
C: MELBA
D: Why don't you give him both?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Why not? Well, if he was rich and famous, maybe I wouldn't mind so much just being -- just a woman to him. Do you think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow?
E: smiling
C: MELBA
D: Somehow! Are you sincere, sweetie? Oooo -- divine. Isn't this heaven?
E: reacting to the masseur's touch to Christian
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I'm not sure. In a way it seems soft of --
N: She is at a loss for a word.
C: MELBA
D: Decadent? Depraved?
N: Christian looks blank.
C: MELBA
D: Wicked?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Well, yes.
C: MELBA
D: That's what I meant by heaven.
S: INT. ROOM IN PLUSH HOTEL
N: Lancey, Shooter and five other men are sitting in comfortably padded chairs around a well-appointed poker table. Everything about the game is in sharp contrast to the one The Kid played in. It is played with chips - expensive ones; there are a couple of bottles of wine on ice, fine cigars, a tray of sandwiches, etc. Lancey's opponents are all wealthy types; two of them could be Texas oil men. The youngest, a good- looking man of thirty, is BILL SCHLAEGEL. The Shooter, as nonplaying dealer, distributes fifth cards to the four remaining players in the hand, and both Lancey and Bill end up with four cards of one suit showing.
C: SHOOTER
D: Still queens -- possible flush -- no help -- possible flush.
E: as he deals
C: FIRST WEALTHY TYPE
D: Queens check to the possibles.
C: LANCEY
D: Check.
C: SECOND WEALTHY TYPE
D: Check.
N: Bill silently tosses in two of the rarest and highest ranking chips on the table.
C: FIRST WEALTHY TYPE
D: Fold.
C: LANCEY
D: And up two.
C: SECOND WEALTHY TYPE
D: Fold.
C: THIRD WEALTHY TYPE
D: Biggest pot yet.
N: A phone RINGS and the Third Wealthy Type answers it.
C: BILL
D: Call the two thou.
C: LANCEY
D: Queen high.
E: turning over queen of his suit
C: BILL
D: Jack high. Can you beat that?
E: indignantly
C: FIRST WEALTHY TYPE
D: He just did.
C: THIRD WEALTHY TYPE
D: It's your office.
E: to Second Wealthy Type
C: SECOND WEALTHY TYPE
D: Dallas or Tulsa?
C: THIRD WEALTHY TYPE
D: She just said office.
N: The Third Wealthy Type takes the phone and speaks on it during the ensuing. The Second Wealthy Type crosses to the bar and fixes himself a drink. Lancey takes in his winnings. Bill hasn't recovered from the blow. There is a hiatus in the game.
C: BILL
D: How the bloody hell did you figure out I didn't have the king or the ace?
C: LANCEY
D: I recollect a young fellow putting the same question to Eddie the Dude. It was a game in the grand lounge of the "J.M. White, Third," the largest paddle-wheeler ever built. "Son," Eddie told him, "All you paid was the looking price. Lessons are extra." First time I heard of this Cincinnati Kid was in New Orleans, at Yeller's. I knew right away I'd have to play him someday.
E: turns to Shooter
C: SHOOTER
D: You'll enjoy his game.
C: LANCEY
D: I may admire it. But if he's all that good, I doubt if I'll enjoy it.
C: SHOOTER
D: The tougher the competition, the better you used to like it.
C: LANCEY
D: I've learned to take everything in moderation.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: It is early evening. The Kid approaches the restaurant with Christian on one arm, Melba on the other.
C: KID
D: Have a drink with us?
E: to Melba
C: MELBA
D: Better not. Shooter said they'd break at seven, and he has to have his food first, then his nap. You know, there's a day in your life I'm looking forward to.
E: looking The Kid over
C: KID
D: In my life?
C: MELBA
D: The day The Kid becomes The Man.
N: She smiles at them both and goes off. They move to enter the restaurant. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. RESTAURANT - KID AND CHRISTIAN
N: The plates with the remains of their main course are in front of them. The Kid pours what's left of a bottle of beer into his glass.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: How'd you sleep Kid?
C: KID
D: I slept okay.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I hope you don't mind my not being there when you woke up.
C: KID
D: No I don't mind -- What she was talking about, Shooter's woman -- I'm going up against a big game soon.
E: then
C: CHRISTIAN
D: She told me. It's a very big game, I hear.
C: KID
D: Yes.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Will it be long?
C: KID
D: Why? What's the matter?
E: then
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I thought --
C: KID
D: Thought what?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I'd go home and see Mama.
C: KID
D: I wouldn't be able to spare you much change.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Oh, I wouldn't want much. Bus is really the best way to go.
C: KID
D: Would a hundred fish do it? For the bus and something nice to bring your Mama?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That would be fine, Kid. Just fine.
C: KID
D: When would you want to go?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: There's no reason for not going right now unless --
N: She lowers her eyes, finding it hard to say the words.
C: KID
D: Unless what?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Unless you wanted to go to bed first.
C: KID
D: Do you want to? Would you like it?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Un-huh. I'd like it.
C: KID
D: You want dessert?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: No. You?
C: KID
D: Coffee?
E: shakes head
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I don't need it.
C: KID
D: Neither do I.
N: He looks o.s. raising a hand to summon the check. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. KID'S APARTMENT - DARKENED WINDOW
N: It is dark in the room and dark outside, the street lamps furnishing only enough light for a faint border around the window shade. Christian's head and nude back move into the Shot; she pulls the shade aside to look out. LONG SHOT - ILLUMINATED CLOCK - CHRISTIAN'S P.O.V. - NIGHT The time is a few minutes before ten.
S: INT. KID'S APARTMENT - CHRISTIAN
N: She lets the shade fall back into place. Moving quietly in the darkness, she begins to dress. CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS to include The Kid, lying on the bed with a sheet over him. He seems to be asleep until he speaks.
C: KID
D: You still haven't said it.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Said what?
C: KID
D: If you're coming back.
N: Christian abandons the process of dressing herself and sits down in the easy chair to answer this question.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Maybe I ought to stay with Mama and Papa a while, and see.
C: KID
D: What's to see?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I never did like city streets.
C: KID
D: Oh.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Uh-huh. The promise didn't fulfill itself for me.
C: KID
D: Promise?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Come to the city and all. Electric lights and flush toilets. All the pretty dreams -- it was all promise.
C: KID
D: Oh, I see.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I don't know if you do or not Kid -- You're city -- and I'm country -- You grew up with it.
C: KID
D: I don't think that's why you're going -- because you like it so much better in the country.
N: She doesn't comment one way or the other, nor does he press the point.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: What will you do?
C: KID
D: Well, I've got that big game.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I heard he's The Man for you.
C: KID
D: Yes. If I won, there would be a lot of money.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You'll win. You been coming on strong a long way. This is your time. Come home with me to Mama's Kid.
E: then after a long moment
C: KID
D: I'm sorry.
E: finally
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I know you are honey -- I know it.
E: gently
N: She gets up and begins to pack her clothes in an old suitcase. After a moment The Kid gets out of bed.
C: KID
D: I'll go down to the bus with you.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You don't have to.
C: KID
D: I'll go down with you.
E: starting to dress
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Kid --
E: after a pause
C: KID
D: Yeah?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: This is going to sound kind of funny to you, but I want to ask it.
C: KID
D: Sure.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Do you think there's any chance, if you do win this big game, that you might do something else besides cards? I don't mean never play poker. I just mean not have it be the only thing you do.
E: hastily
C: KID
D: Hell, it's the only thing I know how to do. What else is there for a guy never finished school? College graduates are walking the streets looking for jobs -- trained people, engineers, scientists!
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I realize --
C: KID
D: When you're The Man, you don't have to hustle -- When you're The Man, The Best, the Big Money comes around on their knees just beggin' to hustle you. I'm not goin' to quit. I'm goin' to win.
E: not letting her speak
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Yes, I can see that. Of course I didn't say quit.
C: KID
D: Well you see how it is.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That's all right.
C: KID
D: Christian, you aren't doing this to be off my back, in case I lose?
E: after a moment
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I been thinking about it a long time. I been planning to go home and see how I felt about things.
C: KID
D: And this just helped you decide.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That's all.
C: KID
D: Then don't go.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: No, this is your time -- Now you go on Honey and you play The Man -- I'll be at Mama's.
E: firmly
N: She closes the suitcase and puts on the one dress she hasn't packed. The Kid, dressed now, watches her for a moment then goes to the bottom drawer of the dresser and opens it to reveal a stack of money under a shirt. He takes five clean twenty-dollar bills and counts them on to the top of the dresser, snapping the crisp leaves gambler style. Then he stoops down again and takes out two more twenties, adding them to the pile.
C: KID
D: I wish it could be more.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That's all right.
N: He doesn't actually hand her the money. He leaves it on top of the dresser and she goes over and takes it, folding the bills and putting them in her change purse. The Kid picks up her suitcase, and she leads the way into the other room. At the front door she stops and looks back at the little apartment for a moment.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I don't guess I'll ever forget these rooms, Kid.
C: KID
D: I don't guess I will either.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You going to move?
C: KID
D: If I win, it won't be good enough. If I lose, I lose it all.
N: She looks at him for a moment, then exits. He follows. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. TAXI - PROCESS - NIGHT
N: The Kid and Christian sit in silence. She puts her hand on his. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. BUS TERMINAL
N: The Kid and Christian sit on a bench in the waiting room, still silent. He has her suitcase between his legs and a pile of magazines on his lap. She looks at a clock and gets to her feet. He follows her to the door, carrying the suitcase and magazines.
S: EXT. BUS PLATFORM - NIGHT
N: Christian boards a bus that has seen better days. On the steps she turns to take the bag from him, but he follows her on.
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT
N: Christian takes a seat. The Kid puts her suitcase in the overhead rack and hands her the magazines, none of which would be classed as heavy reading.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Goodbye, Kid. Good luck.
C: KID
D: Goodbye, Christian.
N: They don't kiss. He turns and goes out.
S: EXT. BUS PLATFORM - NIGHT
N: There are not many passengers boarding this bus. After a couple of moments, the driver closes the door and starts off. Christian waves from the window, and The Kid waves back to her. When the bus has gone, he walks around the outside of the terminal to the front.
S: EXT. FRONT OF BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT
N: There are a couple of cabs at a taxi stand. One of the hackies offers his services to The Kid, but The Kid declines. He wants to walk. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. ROOM IN PLUSH HOTEL
N: It is midday and the poker game is almost twenty- four hours old. Our attention is focused on Bill Schlaegel, who is writing out a check.
C: BILL
D: Four stacks? Right, Schooter?
C: SHOOTER
D: Four.
N: The Shooter takes advantage of the lull in the proceedings to move to the telephone.
C: BILL
D: Thank you for the entertainment, gentlemen. My particular gratitude to you, Lancey. It's been a rare pleasure to watch a great artist at work. Thank you for the privilege.
N: Lancey gives him a quick look, finding this a bit thick.
C: LANCEY
D: Well now, son, you're quite welcome. Can't say I recall another man, in all my days on the three rivers, who seemed to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money.
N: Bill puts his check down in front of The Shooter's place, and gets to his feet.
C: BILL
D: Good day, gentlemen. You're welcome to use the premises as long as you like.
N: CAMERA MOVES with Bill as he passes The Shooter, who is waiting on the phone while the hotel operator dials his number. Bill gives him a friendly pat on the back, and speaks in a low, harsh voice for The Shooter's ears alone.
C: BILL
D: I want to see you.
N: Bill goes out. Shooter looks after him as his party comes on the phone.
C: SHOOTER
D: Hi, Kid. Shooter here. Listen, I told the woman I'd take her to the ball park, but I'm still working. How about you and Christian take her out?
E: into phone
S: INT. KID'S APARTMENT
C: KID
D: Christian's gone home to see her folks.
E: into phone
S: INT. PLUSH HOTEL ROOM
C: SHOOTER
D: Oh. Well listen, would you mind taking her yourself? The gang'll be there, in the section... Thanks. Appreciate it. See you.
E: into phone then
N: He hangs up, returns to the table and starts to shuffle the cards in his own spectacular way. (TIME LAPSE)
S: EXT. BUSCH STADIUM, ST. LOUIS - DAY
N: A game is in progress between the Cardinals and another National League club. The batter at the plate connects for a long one. CAMERA FOLLOWS the flight of the ball.
S: EXT. STANDS - THE KID AND MELBA
N: They are making their way to meet their friends in the section they prefer. They stop to watch the ball as the fans around them rise to their feet. The section they have just reached is in the sun, overlooking the outfield.
S: EXT. FIELD
N: An outfielder races back and makes a difficult catch.
S: EXT. STANDS - THE KID AND MELBA
N: They start on their way again. CAMERA PANS ahead of them to a group consisting of Hoban; HOBAN'S WOMAN, still sexy in her forties; PIG, whose name could derive with equal justification from either his looks or his manners; and SOKAL, who talks colloquial American with a Central European accent. The group as a whole is notable because its members have not risen to their feet with everyone else, because all the men are basking in the sun with their shirts off, because they view the action on the field with detachment, and because, nevertheless, they are constantly placing bets on details of the game. Now, as people around them resume their seats, Sokal is able to confirm that the fly ball has been caught.
C: SOKAL
D: You owe me two fish on the out, plus three on the inning, minus two on no strikeouts so far.
E: to Hoban
N: The Kid and Melba join them.
C: HOBAN
D: Hiya, Kid. Getting yourself in shape for The Man? Shooter still on the job?
E: to Melba
C: HOBAN'S WOMAN
D: Where's Christian?
C: MELBA
D: Lay off that.
E: in a whisper
C: PIG
D: What'd she do, take off? So did mine. Don't lose no sweat, Kid, there's plenty more where they came from. All shapes and sizes.
C: KID
D: Hi, Hoban. Sokal. Pig.
N: He and Melba sit down.
C: HOBAN
D: Boyer. One to two on the sacrifice.
E: to Sokal
C: SOKAL
D: Five to three, I'll give you. Two- fifty against one-fifty.
C: HOBAN
D: Mark it.
C: SOKAL
D: I figure they'll walk him. Fill up first.
C: KID
D: Not with who's coming up. I'll take the same odds.
N: While he is talking, Melba unbuttons his shirt.
C: MELBA
D: Get some of this sun.
C: SOKAL
D: Mark it.
E: to The Kid
C: KID
D: Guess I will.
E: to Melba
N: He takes his shirt off. Melba finds some suntan lotion in her bag, and applies it to her face and arms, her eyes rarely straying from The Kid.
C: HOBAN
D: Bunting, Sokal.
S: EXT. BALL FIELD
N: The bunt is fielded by the first baseman, who throws to second for the out. There is no play at first.
C: SOKAL
D: So they pitched to him. I still win.
C: PIG
D: Everybody been on the phone to everybody about coming to watch you and Lancey. Big Spriigi, Yeller to N'Orleans, Old Lady Fingers. They're all coming.
E: to Kid
C: MELBA
D: Let me give you some of this. Keep you from burning.
E: to Kid
C: KID
D: I don't think --
C: MELBA
D: Can't hurt you.
N: Without waiting for his approval, she goes ahead and spreads the lotion on his skin, painstakingly, as if she were applying paint to canvas, working it in, one area at a time, with her fingertips.
C: HOBAN
D: Chance to invest your profits. Bet you an even fin he make first.
E: to Sokal
C: SOKAL
D: Who we got -- Warwick? You got yourself a bet, pal.
E: looking toward plate
N: The men concentrate their attention on the diamond. CAMERA MOVES IN to Melba's fingers playing across The Kid's midriff. From the field comes the sharp CRACK of a bat against a ball, followed by a SHOUT from the crowd. CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of Melba and The Kid as he looks at her and she meets his gaze with inviting eyes.
C: SOKAL'S VOICE
D: Not your day, Hoban. Hey, beer!
E: calling to a vendor
C: MELBA
D: Mais tu es charmant --
E: softly
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - CLOSEUP - MELBA
N: With the same look of invitation in her eyes.
C: MELBA
D: Charmant. Come here, please.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK. Wearing the same clothes as at the ball park, she is sitting in a chair with her legs tucked under her. The Kid is sitting on a straight chair at a table on which he has a cup of coffee. They are alone in the apartment.
C: KID
D: Any special reason?
C: MELBA
D: Me. I'm special.
N: He stands up but doesn't move toward her.
C: KID
D: Sure you are. You're The Shooter's woman.
C: MELBA
D: Right. And maybe I'll go on being The Shooter's Woman, even after you and I have had our little romp. What do you think about that?
C: KID
D: First place, Old Shooter'll come barging through that door any minute. He said they were winding it up.
C: MELBA
D: No barging. He doesn't have his key with him. Have to buzz from downstairs. So we can treat ourselves to a little sample of things to come.
E: stands up moves toward him provocatively
N: The Kid stays where he is as she comes up against him.
C: KID
D: Also it don't mean anything to you, you're Christian's friend?
C: MELBA
D: Honey, she lost her franchise the minute she got on that bus. You know that. I have a shaky sense of security, Kid. Don't make me feel unwanted.
E: her arms around him
N: He kisses her and lets himself enjoy it for a while, then pulls away.
C: MELBA
D: No good?
C: KID
D: You know damn well how good it was. Where's a pack of cards?
C: MELBA
D: What do we need cards for?
C: KID
D: Gin or casino, you name it. All I know is we're switching to another indoor sport.
S: INT. ROOM IN PLUSH HOTEL
N: The poker game is over. Two of the Wealthy Types have already departed; one is finishing a drink on the way out; another is putting his winnings into his wallet; a third is writing out a check. Lancey and The Shooter still sit at the table in f.g.
C: SHOOTER
D: Lady Fingers'll want to come, I bet, and she's right on the edge of her stake. She could spell me dealing.
C: LANCEY
D: Sure, sure. Haven't seen the dear old bitch in fifteen years.
C: SHOOTER
D: Well, that's it, then. Monday night, Room Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel. And may the best man win.
C: LANCEY
D: Yes, that's how it usually comes out in the long run. You think this boy is going to give me trouble, Shooter?
C: SHOOTER
D: Yeah, he's going to give you trouble.
C: LANCEY
D: I don't want it to be one of those marathon games. Not any more.
C: SHOOTER
D: Like the session with The Portugee at Jolly's in Omaha. Remember?
C: LANCEY
D: Sure, sure. Longest game I ever played though, I was a kid on my way to the Klondike gold rush. At Soapy Smith's in Skagway. Four nights and three days.
C: SHOOTER
D: You win?
C: LANCEY
D: Depends how you look at it. When we wound up, the Yukon River had frozen over and you couldn't get through to Dawson City till the following June. Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush.
C: SHOOTER
D: You been around a long time.
C: LANCEY
D: That is undeniably true. But it doesn't mean I'm ready to retire. How old is this boy of yours?
C: SHOOTER
D: Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something like that.
C: LANCEY
D: Well, now, makes me feel a whole lot better, knowing that. I was thirty- six when I sliced up Eddie the Dude. This Kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years.
S: INT. CORRIDOR, PLUSH HOTEL - FELIX
N: He is standing by an elevator in f.g. keeping watch on a row of room doors including the site of the poker game. FELIX is an impressive physical specimen whose capacity for brutality is masked by a quiet, deferential manner. When he sees a door open, he moves so as to be out of The Shooter's sight as the latter comes toward him. It isn't until The Shooter rounds the corner in f.g. and presses the button for the elevator that Felix makes his presence known.
C: FELIX
D: Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but Mr. Schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you.
N: The doors of the elevator open. Felix yields precedence to The Shooter and they enter it. The doors close.
S: INT. LOBBY, PLUSH HOTEL - AT THE ELEVATORS
N: An elevator opens, and The Shooter and Felix come out.
C: SHOOTER
D: I ought to call my woman.
C: FELIX
D: Yes, of course. They always like to know it if you're going to be late for supper.
N: CAMERA MOVES with them as The Shooter leads the way to a row of telephone booths and enters one.
S: INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA AND THE KID
N: They are sitting at the table in a game of casino. She plays an ace from her hand, adds a seven from the board, and lays them both on top of a three-card pile.
C: MELBA
D: Still building eights.
C: KID
D: Thanks for putting it together for me.
N: He plays an eight and takes in the whole pile.
C: MELBA
D: It's not my game.
N: The telephone RINGS. She stands up.
C: MELBA
D: Want to know what is?
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS her to the phone. She picks it up.
C: MELBA
D: Hello -- Oh, hi, sugar -- why not?
E: into phone
N: She reaches a hand around to the back of her neck, fiddles with her dress a moment, then beckons in The Kid's direction. CLOSE SHOT - THE KID He doesn't understand what she wants but he gets up and comes to her obligingly, CAMERA MOVING with him.
C: MELBA
D: What's the switch?
E: into phone
N: She points to the hook-and-eye fastener at the top of the zipper that runs down the back of her dress. The Kid pantomimes the question "What for?" but she just wiggles her finger impatiently at the fastener while speaking into the phone.
C: MELBA
D: Whose idea was that?
E: into phone
N: The Kid still doesn't know what she has in mind but it seems easier to humor her than not. He unfastens the hook. Melba smiles her thanks and, to his consternation, reaches back and pulls the zipper all the way down. She places her hand over the mouth-piece of the phone.
C: MELBA
D: He's not coming home now.
E: to Kid
N: She steps out of the dress.
C: MELBA
D: Whatever you say, Shooter man.
E: into phone
S: INT. PHONE BOOTH, PLUSH HOTEL - THE SHOOTER
C: SHOOTER
D: Explain to The Kid, will you?
E: into phone
S: INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA AND THE KID
N: Melba in her bra and panties, snuggles against The Kid.
C: MELBA
D: He'll understand.
E: into phone
S: INT. PHONE BOOTH, PLUSH HOTEL - THE SHOOTER
C: SHOOTER
D: Tell him they decided to play a little longer, and I'll call him at his place later when the game's over... Right. Goodbye, honey.
E: into phone
N: He hangs up the phone and emerges from the booth. CAMERA MOVES with him as he joins Felix and they walk toward the hotel entrance.
S: INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA AND THE KID
N: The Kid, his policy toward this new situation still unresolved, holds her lightly while he tries to think it out aloud.
C: KID
D: Listen, Melba --
C: MELBA
D: I have to tell you first. You're sitting down with Lancey next Monday night.
C: KID
D: I wish it was sooner. I wish it was tomorrow.
C: MELBA
D: Shooter'll give you all the details later.
C: KID
D: I don't like waiting that long.
C: MELBA
D: Let's not kick a gift horse in the teeth, sugar. We've got this time together. Let's try to "fill each unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run."
N: She invites a kiss and he obliges her. But there is a contrary force at work inside him.
C: KID
D: Listen, what I was going to say before, I don't want you to think I'm being some kind of jerk or I don't feel you'd be great to sack up with.
C: MELBA
D: Then let's cut the filibuster.
C: KID
D: I've made dolls that were friends of mine's wives. I figured if they were willing, they were doing it to their husbands, I wasn't.
C: MELBA
D: Of course. Any other attitude, you're degrading the woman. You're not treating her as a person with a mind of her own, but as somebody's property.
N: Again she presses close to him and again he savors her for a moment.
C: KID
D: Only thing is, it's different with The Shooter than anybody else. He's so straight, I got the obligation to be straighter with him than other people. So do you. On account of we both owe him plenty.
C: MELBA
D: I thought we just agreed that what you and I did was strictly between us.
C: KID
D: Can't be. Shooter's the closest thing to family I got. It's almost like he was my old man. Don't you see how that's got a bearing on us?
E: decisively, pulling away from her with a pat of dismissal
N: He starts out. Melba stares after him, scarcely able to believe what is being done to her.
C: MELBA
D: Sure, it means I'm your mother.
S: EXT. SCHLAEGEL ESTATE - DAY
N: An expensive automobile, with Felix at the wheel and The Shooter next to him in the front seat, approaches the main house of a lavish estate in a St. Louis suburb. It continues along the driveway past the house.

N: In swimming trunks, Bill is spoon-feeding a year-old BABY in a highchair. Looking o.s., he waves in greeting to The Shooter.

N: He walks from the parked car toward the pool, returning Bill's salutation.
S: EXT. AREA AROUND POOL
N: SHOOTING from behind The Shooter as he approaches the attractive family group that includes, besides Bill and the baby, a FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL who is having her hair brushed after swimming by ROSANNA SCHLAEGEL, her beautiful mother. A family dog completes the picture. Bill continues to feed the baby as he hails The Shooter.
C: BILL
D: Shooter -- very generous of you to come on such short notice. Rosanna you know, and I think you've met my daughter June. No point introducing you to William the Fourth. He has a bad memory for names.
E: indicating baby
C: SHOOTER
D: Mrs. Schlaegel. How are you, June. What's it all about, Bill?
E: greeting them in turn
C: BILL
D: Little something I'd like to sound you out on. But the least I can do is offer you a drink.
C: ROSANNA
D: Like me to fix it, love?
C: BILL
D: Wonderful. Why don't you do a batch of your Bloody Marys? If that's okay with you, Shooter?
C: SHOOTER
D: Great. Whatever.
N: As she goes off, Rosanna cautions June about her hair.
C: ROSANNA
D: Just don't let it get wet again.
N: As soon as his wife is gone, Bill goes right to the topic he doesn't want to discuss in her presence.
C: BILL
D: I've been quite busy on the telephone since I last saw you. There's a lot of interest all over the country in this game with Lancey and The Kid.
C: SHOOTER
D: Betting interest?
C: BILL
D: Jack Doyle in New York is giving twelve to five on Lancey. Same odds in Reno. I've taken fifty thousand of it so far.
C: SHOOTER
D: Fifty thousand!
C: BILL
D: I'll probably go for more but I didn't want to rock the odds.
C: SHOOTER
D: I knew you liked The Kid's style but why you going in so deep?
C: BILL
D: Two reasons. First, I want to see that smug old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me. Second, as long as that's going to happen, I don't see why I shouldn't make some money out of it.
C: SHOOTER
D: But how can you be so sure? The Kid could do it, we both know that, but --
C: BILL
D: "Could" isn't good enough for a man who hates to lose money as much as I do. He's going to need help -- from the best man with a pack of cards between Omaha and New Orleans.
C: SHOOTER
D: Not a chance, Bill. You ought to know I never ever use what I got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game.
C: BILL
D: Sure, I know it. That's why you're the man they choose to give them a square deal. That's what makes it so perfect. Nobody'll be looking for it.
C: SHOOTER
D: It's out. Out.
C: BILL
D: The great thing is they'll be so close, The Kid won't need much. Three or four key hands.
C: SHOOTER
D: Understand this, Bill. I'd like for The Kid to win, and I sure as hell don't want to see you lose all that money --
C: BILL
D: If I did, I'd have to collect that twelve grand you owe me. Not myself. My collection agents. You knew poor Wildwood Jones, didn't you?
C: SHOOTER
D: OK but I'm paying it off! It's comin' in ain't it? Six grand already. Bill, you got to listen to me --!
E: then as Bill just looks at him
C: BILL
D: No, I don't. It's quite the other way around. You have some delusion you're a free agent, but you're not. I own you.
C: SHOOTER
D: For God's sake --!
C: BILL
D: Shut up. I'll cross the twelve off the books and give you ten thousand dollars in cash. And you can tell The Kid if he needs more of a stake, I'll put it up. Marvelous. Here's Rosanna with what you need.
E: looks o.s. and smiles
N: CAMERA MOVES to include Rosanna carrying a tray with glasses and a pitcher full of Bloody Marys.

S: INT. BAR - THE KID
N: He is drinking a bottle of beer slowly. CAMERA PANS to another bar stool where a customer is having his shoes shined by a NEGRO BOY who slaps his rag against the shoes with a fine sense of rhythm. Finished, he collects his dime and nickel tip, and moves to The Kid.
C: BOY
D: Shine them up for you sir?
C: KID
D: No, thanks.
C: BOY
D: Fetch you a newspaper maybe?
C: KID
D: No.
C: BOY
D: How about a singy-song then? I play good.
C: KID
D: Play what?
N: The Boy takes out a tobacco can with the lid torn off and the top flattened down and shakes it, producing a sound like the rustle of dry leaves. Then he produces a similar can that makes a rattling noise when he shakes it.
C: BOY
D: Dry corn in this one. Blue shale stone from the river in this one. You ready?
C: KID
D: Yes, I'm ready.
N: The Boy looks at the BARTENDER, who has moved closer to see what's going on.
C: BOY
D: You ready?
E: to bartender
C: BARTENDER
D: Hell, I'm ready for anything.
N: The Boy stands perfectly still for a few seconds, then begins to shake the can with corn in it. After a bit he brings in the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent the rustle of the first can. At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure, delicate voice. It is catfish music created on the spot and sounds strangely like the idle tunes Christian likes to hum.
C: KID
D: Thank you very much. That was nice. Where did you learn to do that?
E: when the song is over
C: BOY
D: I picked it up from Herman.
C: KID
D: Who is Herman?

C: KID
D: Well, I don't want a shine, but here's fifteen cents.
C: BOY
D: Thank you, sir.
C: BARTENDER
D: And here's another dime for you, fella.
N: He rings up a NO SALE and flips a dime to The Boy, who is astonished and then worried by this munificence. Suddenly he grabs his tobacco cans and his shoe-shine kit, and runs out into the street.

S: EXT. CROSSROADS COMMUNITY - DAY
N: The bus stops momentarily at a small cluster of buildings around an intersection. The Kid is the only passenger to get off here. As the bus continues on its way, he goes to an attendant in a gas station on one corner, and asks a question. Referred to a general store and post office on another corner, he crosses and goes into it. The STOREKEEPER comes back outside with him to point out the route to where he wants to go. It is along a dirt road that winds uphill behind the store. The Kid starts up the road. (TIME LAPSE)

He starts down an even narrower road leading to a little farm on a hillock in the valley. It consists of a modest cabin, a single barn, a fenced cow pasture, and a few cultivated fields. (TIME LAPSE)
S: EXT. CRAIGIE FARM - DAY
N: Christian comes around a curve in a path on one side of the house, carrying two five-gallon milk cans slung in a yoke over her shoulder. A little dog YAPS and runs from the front door of the house to the front gate. She looks in that direction and CAMERA MOVES to include The Kid as he unlatches the gate and walks toward her. After a moment's hesitation, she moves to meet him, gliding on her bare feet to keep the water in the cans from slopping out.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Hello, Kid.
C: KID
D: Can I help you with those?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Taking if off is harder than taking it on in.
N: She turns toward the side of the house and walks to the kitchen door. The Kid follows.

C: KID
D: Fine.

S: INT. CRAIGIE KITCHEN - CHRISTIAN, THE KID AND MRS. CRAIGIE
N: MRS. CRAIGIE, Christian's mother, opens the door for them, giving The Kid a sharp, appraising glance.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: This is Eric, Mama. He's come to see me.
C: MRS. CRAIGIE
D: How do, Eric.
N: Christian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns her back. Mrs. Craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the drain board. She and Christian each take a can and pour the water from it to prime the pump.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: We lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning.
N: The Kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming pots on it, and the table alongside with a half-dozen hampers of green beans.
C: MRS. CRAIGIE
D: There's coffee. And sour ham and bread in the warmer, if you're hungry Eric.
N: As soon as they are finished with the pump, Mrs. Craigie and Christian turn to the table, where they begin to snip stems and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove.
C: MRS. CRAIGIE
D: You know anything about canning, you know we can't stop now. If we'd been looking for company, we never would have started.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Spring beans, you have to cook them fast. But you find yourself some breakfast.
C: KID
D: I'm all right. Bus stopped for doughnuts and coffee.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You can stay with us tonight and still make it back to St. Lou on the Sunday schedule by about midnight. I told Mama and Papa about The Man. And all.
C: KID
D: Where is Mr. Craigie?
C: MRS. CRAIGIE
D: To the barn. Why don't you go down and introduce yourself? Christian and me'll be at this another hour or two.
C: KID
D: I think I will. I think I'd like that. Okay?
E: to Christian
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Sure. And I'll see you a little later on. Papa don't know everything. About you and me.
E: then, as he starts out
N: The Kid looks quickly at her and then at Mrs. Craigie, who keeps her gaze fixed on the beans.
S: EXT. CRAIGIE BARN - CRAIGIE - DAY
N: He is pitching manure from all over the cow-lot into a pile banked against the side of the barn, working a long-handled shovel with practised ease. He looks o.s. and sees The Kid approaching but continues his work as The Kid enters the SHOT. Nor does he stop shoveling while they are talking, except at moments of particular significance to him.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Hello.
C: KID
D: How do you do, Mr. Craigie. I'm Eric Stoner.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Christian's Eric.
C: KID
D: That's right.
C: CRAIGIE
D: You seen her?
C: KID
D: She's helping her mother can.
C: CRAIGIE
D: You minding to marry Christian?
N: The Kid looks at him a long moment then --
C: KID
D: You got any objections if I do, or if I don't?
N: Craigie takes a couple of steps toward The Kid, his boots sucking in the muddy ground.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Son, that's what I call a sharp answer.
C: KID
D: It was what I call a sharp question.
C: CRAIGIE
D: We don't know much about you, Christian's mother and me.
C: KID
D: I'm what's known as a three-river man. Which just means I go around playing stud poker wherever I can find the kind of action I'm looking for.
C: CRAIGIE
D: You met Christian when she was working to Hot Springs?
C: KID
D: Yeah. I was playing in this game in the hotel and she was a waitress in the coffee shop. We went out. I told her I thought she could get a better job in St. Louis.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Now how did you happen to tell her that? Maybe you run some kind of employment service on the side?
C: KID
D: I said it because I wanted her in St. Louis. Anyway, she made it there and she called me and we been seeing each other ever since.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Living together?
N: The Kid takes his time before deciding how to answer this one.
C: KID
D: Yeah, living together.
C: CRAIGIE
D: How come she come home now? She going to have a baby?
C: KID
D: Not that I know of.
C: CRAIGIE
D: You two have a fight?
C: KID
D: No.
C: CRAIGIE
D: She must have had a reason.
C: KID
D: Think so? Well, you've known her longer than me. Look, Mr. Craigie, let me and Christian find out a few things then maybe I won't have to answer your questions.
E: then
C: CRAIGIE
D: I never run across anybody like you. I guess I don't understand gamblers.
C: KID
D: That's all right. I don't understand farmers.
C: CRAIGIE
D: You say things that sound smart alecky. But I'm not sure if they really are smart alecky.
C: KID
D: Well I can't take into account what somebody's going to feel every time I say something.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Are you a believer?
C: KID
D: In some things.
C: CRAIGIE
D: I mean in God.
C: KID
D: That's a tough one. I don't disbelieve in Him, but I couldn't say I believed in Him either. I guess I just never paid Him much mind. Didn't seem important.
C: CRAIGIE
D: God not important?
C: KID
D: I don't mean what He does isn't important -- if He exists. I mean it's not important to me whether He exists or not.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Christian was raised in a Christian home.
C: KID
D: Is that so? I didn't know --- I'm not aware of the difference. I'm not asking permission to marry Christian, you know.
E: then pause
C: CRAIGIE
D: I know.
C: KID
D: If I was, the only person I'd be asking it from is her.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Who is this fella Christian says you're going to play that's so important?
E: after a moment
C: KID
D: He's the king of the stud poker players.
C: CRAIGIE
D: And you're going to play him.
C: KID
D: Yes.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Are you any good?
C: KID
D: I'm this good. The Man has got to play me.
C: CRAIGIE
D: What happens if he don't?
C: KID
D: Then I'm The Man.
C: CRAIGIE
D: That important to you?
C: KID
D: I been trying to figure that out ever since I set it up.
C: CRAIGIE
D: You playing because of money?
C: KID
D: Not really.
E: after a moment
C: CRAIGIE
D: Christian said you never was much worried about money -- I been worried about money most of my life -- up until I figured out it wasn't so important.
C: KID
D: No, it's necessary, but it isn't so important.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Well how come you want to play this King fella?
C: KID
D: Ambition -- maybe security, like that.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Is it aspiration to be the King or just uncertainty about the future?
C: KID
D: I ain't looking for security if that's what you mean.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Not trying to lock something up tight and nail it down?
C: KID
D: That would figure into it. But that isn't all of it. -- It's important to me.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Now son which is more important to you, this king business or Christian?
C: KID
D: If you got the guts to ask that question, Mr. Craigie, I guess I got the guts to answer it. Christian, if you came right down to it, is not as important as doing what I have to do.
N: Craigie has finished piling the manure. He puts away his shovel.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Well son, I had to know.
C: KID
D: Know what?
C: CRAIGIE
D: There never was a man worth a damn, to my mind, who let his woman stand in the way of the thing he had to do. I got to go now -- see what I can do for a sick heifer. Why don't you take Christian, when her Mama lets go of her, and tell her I said you should go to the old spring. It's a good place.
E: then

C: CHRISTIAN
D: Don't worry. It's on our land -- Nobody uses it.
N: She starts to swim, CAMERA MOVING with her upper back as she reaches the side of the pool and pulls herself on to the bank, lying on her stomach. The Kid joins her, first drawing himself up on his stomach alongside her, then turning on his back to look through the slats at the sun.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You must have said something to Papa gave him the picture on us in St. Lou. Else he never would have spoke to you about this place.
C: KID
D: I told him on account of he already knew. Never any sense feeding a man a lie he's not going to believe.

S: EXT. CRAIGIE PORCH - CRAIGIE AND THE KID - NIGHT
N: The two men are sitting just outside the kitchen, where Mrs. Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason jars they filled earlier. The paste and some of the jars are just inside an open window on a shelf behind the men's heads. The light comes from a kerosene lamp inside.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Let me get this straight in my head. Cards is all a matter of luck, who gets dealt the best ones.
N: The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck in his pocket. During the next few lines he uses the paste on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to form three double-thick cards. One of these has two faces, another two backs, and the third a back and a face.
C: CRAIGIE
D: So when one of you professional gamblers sits down with a bunch of your -- what do you call them -- customers, clients?
C: KID
D: The technical term is "suckers." Or "marks."
C: CRAIGIE
D: Their chance of winning is just as good as yours, except if you got a way to control it, who gets what cards. Right?
C: KID
D: Not right. That's cheating and it's not any part of what we're talking about.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Then how do you win?
C: KID
D: I'll show you.
N: He displays his three cards.
C: KID
D: You see one of these cards is white on both sides, one is red on both sides, and the other is white on one side, red on the other.
C: CRAIGIE
D: What about it?
N: The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall.
C: KID
D: This. I put the three cards in a hat and shake them up, and then I ask you to draw one card out blind. Put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side.
N: Craigie does as instructed. The ensuing dialogue assumes the card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red" and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue.
C: KID
D: Okay, red on top. That eliminates the all-white card, right. So the card you've picked is one of two -- the all-red or the red-and-white. One out of two is an even chance, an even-money proposition. Right -- you follow me?
C: CRAIGIE
D: I think so.
C: KID
D: So if I said I'll bet you a dollar to seventy-five cents the other side of that card is red, you'd take the bet wouldn't you?
C: CRAIGIE
D: Seems like. Yeah.
C: KID
D: And that answer makes you a sucker. Because the odds are two to one, the other side of that card is red, and I ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy- five.
C: CRAIGIE
D: But if there are just the two possibilities.
C: KID
D: There are three possibilities. That can be the red side of the red- and-white card, or it can be either side of the all-red card. In two cases out of three the other side is red. And I'd win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it.
E: indicating card on table
C: CRAIGIE
D: You would?
E: dubiously
C: KID
D: Sure. It's obvious when I explain it, isn't it?
C: CRAIGIE
D: Reckon so. Except if there's only two things that the bottom side can be, red or white --
C: KID
D: Take my word for it -- the odds are two to one. And knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker. Not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are. In a poker game there can be a million different situations, each with a different set of odds to figure. The man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much...
C: CRAIGIE
D: The sucker is still took advantage of, isn't he? The gambler knows something he don't know.
C: KID
D: Sure -- like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy's. Or two business men are in competition, or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom. Whatever your line is, the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better.
C: CRAIGIE
D: Seems like there should be something else to it --
C: KID
D: There is -- Making the man you're playing against think he's got the best hand -- and making him pay to find out.

C: KID
D: Tuesday there was a ball game, but then the Cardinals went on the road. I never known time to drag so; I was all torn apart --
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Because of the poker game coming up?
C: KID
D: That's how I read it, but I was reading it wrong. It wasn't Lancey or the game that was chewing at my insides --
C: CHRISTIAN
D: What else is there could give you such a bad time?
C: KID

N: She kisses him.
C: KID
D: When you talk about doing something besides poker if I get to be The Man, you don't mean pass up the chance to make some dough from it for a while?

S: INT. KID'S APARTMENT
N: The Kid, looking completely refreshed, is readying himself for the game. He has chosen casual, comfortable clothes, and now he collects three items to take with him: a large bottle of mouthwash, a green sun-vizor, and finally, his stake. When he withdraws the money from the dresser drawer, we can see the pile has increased in size. The Kid finds an envelope to put it in, and he is ready to go. He starts out but in the middle of the kitchen he stops to look at his watch. It is too early. He crosses to the stove, pours himself a cup of coffee, and sits down to drink it.
S: INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM
N: Lancey has decided on a change of costume from his last game, and this time he goes for the old-fashioned velvet smoking jacket and silk foulard. Over this he puts on a light overcoat.

D: I made up my mind to this. I ain't going to give him any help till he needs it.
C: MELBA
D: I'm glad you're taking a stand.
C: SHOOTER
D: Hey, what if he starts off lucky and stays ahead of the game the whole way. It could happen, you know.
C: MELBA
D: You'll make it happen, Baby. I've got faith in you --
S: EXT. CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT
N: The hands are at 7:25.
S: INT. TAXI - THE KID AND DRIVER - NIGHT
N: The Kid is looking at the clock tower.
C: KID
D: Once more around the square.
S: EXT. SQUARE OUTSIDE DORSET HOTEL - NIGHT
N: The taxi drives away from CAMERA following The Kid's instruction. CAMERA PANS to the front of the Dorset Hotel, which they have just passed. It is fifty years old or more, no longer elegant but still respectable.
S: INT. POKER SUITE - LANCEY
N: He is standing at ease among old friends, sipping a creme de menthe frappe.
C: LANCEY
D: It's a friendly town, St. Louis. I've always said that.
N: CAMERA MOVES to take in the people around him, one after another. The Shooter is there, and Pig and Sokal and Hoban, and Melba and Hoban's woman and a couple of other women whose main attributes are physical, and Bill Schlaegel. Out of town representatives include LADY FINGERS, who is about fifty, down on her luck but still cheerful and remarkably energetic; and YELLER, a light-skinned Negro who has achieved stature in what is mainly a white man's world, through diplomacy and a quick wit. The room is the large living-room of a once splendid suite; there are enough chairs and couches around the walls to accommodate a good many spectators, while the middle of the room has been cleared for a round table with seven chairs.
C: SHOOTER
D: We ain't seen much of you though, last seven, eight years.
C: LANCEY
D: Climate, Shooter. In my declining years, I spend more and more time in Florida and the Gulf Coast.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Lot of folks been figuring another reason you was keeping clear of the three rivers.
C: LANCEY
D: What reason is that, Lady Fingers?
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Cincinnati Kid. That the way it is, Lancey? You been scared of The Kid?
E: laughs
C: LANCEY
D: Should I be scared of him?
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Damn right you should! I'm telling you, that boy going to make your stomach ulcer bleed before the night is out. He's close to murder. I seen him give a fella the shakes so bad on a fourth card, it took a pint of corn liquor to settle him down.
C: LANCEY
D: Thanks for the warning.
N: Lancey notices that most of the people around him have turned to look at the doorway. He glances in the same direction in a casual sort of way. FEATURING THE KID He saunters toward Lancey. Almost everyone greets him, and he responds to as many as he can. Melba intercepts him.
C: MELBA
D: Mow the man down, sugar pie, make it quick and bloody. Been too many lean years for all of us.
C: KID
D: I intend to take Shooter right along with Lancey.
C: MELBA
D: I'm not talking about the old Shooter. He's been factory rebuilt. A new spirit dwelleth in him, and his gaze is on distant hills.
N: The Kid would like these cryptic words explained, but Lady Fingers descends on him.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: So you showed up after all. You're a braver boy than I thought, so much the worse for you.
C: KID
D: You think I'll be sorry I come?
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Bound to. That Lancey ain't human, he's one of them barracuda fish. He's liable to bleed to death, right on a flush hand before he give up to you. I seen him gut a fella so bad, the fella quit and got up and spit red in the john and went square.
N: The Kid sees Lancey approaching, and turns to him.
C: LANCEY
D: Hello, Kid. Pleasure to know you.
C: KID
D: Lancey. I been looking forward a long time.
C: LANCEY
D: Sure, sure. You seem to know about everybody. Yeller from New Orleans?
C: KID
D: What do you say, Yeller? Still feeling salty with me?
C: YELLER
D: Forgiven long since. We had a little jurisdictional dispute.
E: to Lancey
C: KID
D: I hustled a couple of boys, right in his territory.
C: YELLER
D: So I tried to tell him our rules down there. Colored marks are for colored hustlers.
C: KID
D: And I tried to tell him how I got no prejudice. When I'm on the edge of my stake, I hustle anybody at all, regardless of race, creed or color. Anybody at all.
C: YELLER
D: Including my girl.
C: KID
D: Hell, I figured I was doin' you a favor.
C: YELLER
D: You did.
N: Suddenly they both laugh over a private memory and shake hands, obviously old friends.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Did you know Old Cottonhead died?
E: to Lancey
C: LANCEY
D: No, I hadn't heard.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Heart give out in a high-low game.
C: LANCEY
D: How you feel, Kid?
E: turning to The Kid
C: KID
D: Great. You?
C: LANCEY
D: The best. You think maybe we ought to see if we can stir up some action?
C: KID
D: Whatever you say, Lancey. You're the -- You're our guest in this town.
E: correcting himself
C: LANCEY
D: Well, I'm kind of in the mood to play a little cards.
C: KID
D: I think we ought to be able to get a game together in this crowd.
C: LANCEY
D: But first you take a look at things -- make sure everything's the way you want it. I already been around.
C: KID
D: Thanks. I'll do that.
N: He turns toward the center of the room. The Shooter follows him. MED. SHOT - AT POKER TABLE - KID AND SHOOTER The old, solidly built wooden table has been covered with a white linen cloth on top of a blanket. The cloth is tied down under the rim so that the surface of the table is flat, tight and cushioned by the blanket. The Kid presses his fingers into it to test these factors.
C: SHOOTER
D: It's an old table. Everything's pretty old in this hotel.
C: KID
D: It's solid, that's what counts. And you got the top fixed perfect.
N: Lancey comes into the SHOT behind them.
C: LANCEY
D: Light all right for you?
C: SHOOTER
D: Two hundred watt bulb.
C: KID
D: Fine, excellent. Okay with you?
C: LANCEY
D: Sure, sure. Shooter's set us up just great.
C: KID
D: Sure has.
C: SHOOTER
D: Thank you, gents. Tried to do the best I could. Cards?
E: looks from one to the other
C: LANCEY
D: Why not?
C: KID
D: Good a time as any.
C: SHOOTER
D: Hoban! Okay! You both know Joe Hoban. He's a draw poker man, but clean and straight as they come.
E: calling to Kid and Lancey
N: Hoban comes into the SHOT with a dispatch case, which he sets on the table. He unlocks it with a key and turns it upside down. Thirty sealed decks of cards spill on the table.
C: HOBAN
D: They come from the St. Louis Bridge Club, but they're poker size cards. They been bonded by the club steward and I seen him take them out of the safe. Shooter, Lady Fingers and me pick them up and come straight here with them.
C: SHOOTER
D: Hoban's selling them to us at five dollars a pack, with the usual guarantee. If it's proved any deck is spooked, he pays off the losers.
C: LANCEY
D: St. Louis Bridge Club, eh? Steward still that old yard bird Okra?
C: HOBAN
D: That's him.
E: disturbed
C: LANCEY
D: Old stud man, Okra.
E: not noticing; to Kid
C: KID
D: I don't know him.
C: LANCEY
D: Quite a character. Quite a character.
C: HOBAN
D: Nobody heard from me what the cards were for, Kid.
E: anxiously
N: There is a quick exchange of glances all around as the other three realize what the imaginary suspicion is behind Hoban's defensive reaction.
C: LANCEY
D: Been ten years since I seen or spoke to Old Okra.
E: to Kid
C: KID
D: 'Kay, fine. Don't worry about it, Lancey. Who's sitting down with us, Shooter?
C: SHOOTER
D: Four of us. Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc Sokal. If that's all right with you both?
C: KID
D: 'Kay, fine.
C: LANCEY
D: Sure, sure. Shall we have a look at the decks?
E: to Kid
N: CLOSE SHOT - KID AND LANCEY with the pile of decks and the empty dispatch case on the table in front of them. They start checking the decks one by one, each putting the ones he has covered in a pile for the other's consideration. They examine the seals and the cellophane visually, and they also sniff both ends for the odor of a hot iron. By the time they are through with this process; The Kid has found three decks he isn't satisfied with, and Lancy two. The Kid passes his three rejects to Lancey, who tosses them back into the dispatch case without looking at them. Then Lancey tries to submit his two to The Kid, but The Kid waves them away, and Lancey throws them, too, into the case.
C: LANCEY
D: Well, Kid, what's your game?
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the other four players, who have come up to the table, still not taking chairs until Lancey and The Kid have chosen theirs. Though Lancey's question is purely ritualistic, they look to The Kid for his reply.
C: KID
D: I don't mind stud poker if that's okay with you.
C: LANCEY
D: I got no objections to stud. Gentlemen?
E: to the others
N: Consulting the others is a formality, but all four of them -- Yeller, Shooter, Pig and Sokal -- nod or grunt or otherwise indicate assent. MED. SHOT - FEATURING BILL across the room, he is indicating to The Shooter that he'd like a word with him before play begins. MED. SHOT - FEATURING SHOOTER He detaches himself from the group and sidles inconspicuously over to Bill.
C: BILL
D: Tell The Kid I have a suite on the fifth floor. He can drop up during the breaks. Bedroom all for him any time he wants a nap.
C: SHOOTER
D: That's thoughtful of you, Bill.
C: BILL
D: I'm a thoughtful man. I hope you are.
N: THE POKER TABLE The Kid gestures to Lancey to choose his seat. Lancey acknowledges the courtesy, glances at the window and picks himself a chair facing away from it.
C: LANCEY
D: Privilege of age. Can't take the glare of the morning sun in my eyes.
N: The Kid, following protocol, moves to a seat directly across from Lancey's. The Shooter takes his place at the table halfway between The Kid and Lancey, and pulls the twenty- five eligible packs of cards to him.
C: SHOOTER
D: You want to have the usual brandy and coffee on hand, Kid? Anything special for you, Lancey?
C: LANCEY
D: Why, yes, Shooter. Creme de menthe frappe. Green.
C: SHOOTER
D: You got that, Hoban? Gentlemen, if there are no objections, I'm the dealer. These rooms have been contracted for, and there will be an ante of ten dollars per chair, per day. During the breaks for me, Old Lady Fingers has agreed to deal, but she don't care to be a player --
E: glances around to the table
C: LADY FINGERS' VOICE
D: Do too care!
N: CAMERA PANS to reveal Lady Fingers as she steps from among the spectators to a place behind Lancey.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Can't afford to play, that's the real truth. Had a bad year and I'm way over my edge.
C: SHOOTER
D: Lady Fingers will get three dollars an hour from the ante, plus her room and food, and a five-minute break every hour. Gents?
C: LANCEY
D: Fine, Shooter man.
C: KID
D: 'Kay with us.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: If you don't see me when you need me, call room three-oh-eight. You know who else ain't with us no more? Miriam, widow used to run the kitchen game to South Chi. Lost two month's Relief at blackjack, coal dealer cut her credit, and she froze in her bed.
E: taps Lancey's shoulder
N: THE PLAYERS - FEATURING THE KID The Kid has taken his roll from his pocket and is counting it out rapidly. The other players watch, interested to see how much he is putting out. After counting out one stack of thirty hundreds, he distributes the rest in stacks of twenties, tens and fives, folding each bill over once as protection against picking up more than one at a time.
C: SHOOTER
D: Gentlemen, this is a game of five- card stud poker. There is no limit. A dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.
N: The Kid has completed his count. REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING LANCEY He takes the money from his satchel.
C: LANCEY
D: Five grand? Nice, tidy sum. I'll put out the same.
N: CAMERA PANS to Yeller.
C: YELLER
D: I swear I don't know what I'm doing sitting down with you titans, but maybe it's worth putting up five thousand for the educational value.
N: CAMERA PANS to Pig as he brings out a roll and drops it casually in front of him.
C: PIG
D: I'll play with what I have in my pocket till I have to send out for more. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight hundred, I don't know.
N: CAMERA PANS past The Kid to Sokal, who is counting out bills from an impressive roll.
C: SOKAL
D: Five G's, I'm with it. Don't mean I'm goin' blow it all, though.
N: CAMERA PANS to The Shooter, who is counting out a smaller stake than anyone.
C: SHOOTER
D: Last and certainly least --
N: He puts his money out without counting it, takes a deck of cards, rips the cellophane off it, takes the jokers and tosses them offhandedly to one side, not seeming to take aim. FEATURING THE JOKERS Heads turn as the cards sail through the air in unison, landing inside The Shooter's familiar hat, which is resting crown down on the mantelpiece. The spectators gape at the display of dexterity. FEATURING THE SHOOTER He begins to shuffle and all eyes are upon him, not from suspicion but from pure admiration. He is in peak form, shuffling six times, once for each player and then slapping the cards down before Lancey, who is to the right of him, with an empty chair in between. CLOSE - LANCEY He waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible nod. THE POKER TABLE The Shooter acknowledges the compliment with the same sort of gesture. Then he begins to deal in his magnificently precise way, pitching each card so that it comes to a stop six inches in front of the player's money and in clear view of everyone at the table. CLOSE SHOT - SHOOTER'S HANDS With Sokal in b.g. It is notable that as The Shooter completes dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card, there is no visible difference in the motion of his hands. He calls the cards as he deals them.
C: SHOOTER
D: Seven, nine, trey, nine, ace, and The Shooter guns up a ten. Ace bets.
C: LANCEY
D: Ten dollars.
C: SHOOTER
D: Dealer folds.
C: SOKAL
D: Call the sawbuck.
N: CLOSE SHOT - FROM BEHIND KID He looks at his hole card: an ace.
C: KID
D: I'm in.
C: PIG'S VOICE
D: Call.
C: YELLER'S VOICE
D: Call.
N: THE POKER TABLE The Shooter deals again.
C: SHOOTER
D: King to the seven, pair of nines, deuce to the trey, queen-nine, ace- eight.
C: KID
D: Nines bet twenty bucks.
N: Each other player folds in turn. The Shooter pulls in the cards, and The Kid pulls in the seventy dollars. The Shooter shuffles and deals again.
C: SHOOTER
D: Queen, ten, king, four, ace again, and a king for The Shooter.
C: LANCEY
D: Ace bets ten dollars
C: SHOOTER
D: King over.
N: TWO SHOT - HOBAN AND BILL They are perched on the back of a love seat at the far end of the room, with their feet on the arms. This gives them a view of the table through a pair of opera glasses they share, but they are far enough from it to be able to discuss the hands freely.
C: HOBAN
D: Shooter won't stay on a king or an ace if there's another one showing.
C: BILL
D: What's he have to have in the hole?
C: HOBAN
D: Ten or better. With no other ten showing.
N: THE POKER TABLE The second round has been dealt. Sokal has a queen-eight, The Kid a pair of tens, Pig a king- seven, Lancey an ace- five. Yeller, like The Shooter, has folded on the first card. The Kid makes the same bet of twenty dollars, and the other three remaining players drop.
C: LANCEY
D: New deck.
N: Unhesitatingly, The Shooter pulls in the cards, separates them into four or five piles, and tears each pile in two. He glances around, and Hoban comes up behind him. The Shooter hands him the torn-up cards and unseals another pack, going through the same routine of throwing the jokers into his hat. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. POKER SUITE - AT THE POKER TABLE
N: It is around midnight, and there is a more settled look to the game; some of the players have removed their coats, and there is a good deal of smoke in the air. The Kid has a cup of coffee by him, presumably with brandy in it; Lancey has his frappe; Pig is drinking whiskey; the Shooter and Yeller have bottles of bear. It is the end of a hand. With about six hundred dollars in the pot, Pig, who has been called, turns over his hole card triumphantly.
C: PIG
D: Aces over eights. Thank you, gents. Be a laugh if the two champs ended up cleaned.
E: waits for a challenge, but the others turn their cards as he pulls in money, to Yeller
N: CLOSE SHOT - LANCEY He barely notices Pig's remark. CLOSE SHOT - KID He barely notices Lancey's reaction to Pig's remark. CAMERA MOVES among the spectators, who also have a more settled look about them. There is a bar, attended by a uniformed HOTEL BELLMAN, and most of the people are drinking. We see in passing a couple go through the door to the bedroom and close it behind them. CAMERA HOLDS on the love seat as Bill rejoin Hoban on their perch.
C: BILL
D: Any action?
C: HOBAN
D: What do you expect first five or six hours?
E: shrugs
C: BILL
D: Still feeling each other out?
C: HOBAN
D: Pig's ahead about a grand, Shooter maybe three hundred.
E: TIME LAPSE
N: CLOSE SHOT - CARDS BEING DEALT Sokal gets a nine of clubs, The Kid a six, Pig a queen, Yeller a king, Lancey a jack, and The Shooter a four.
C: SHOOTER'S VOICE
D: King bets.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the players. There is less oral accompaniment to the betting now.
C: YELLER
D: King says twenty.
N: Lancey calls, Shooter drops, Sokal calls, The Kid drops.
C: PIG
D: In for twenty.
C: SHOOTER
D: To the nine a ten, to the queen a seven, to the king a jack, and to the jack a jack.
E: dealing
C: LANCEY
D: Pair of jacks will venture a hundred dollars.
C: SOKAL
D: I'm in.
E: who has the nine and ten of clubs showing
C: PIG
D: Up two hundred dollars.
E: after studying the board
C: YELLER
D: Leave it to the rich folk.
E: folding
N: TWO SHOT - HOBAN AND BILL
C: BILL
D: Lancey could be laying for him with three jacks.
C: HOBAN
D: Pig don't think so.
C: LANCEY'S VOICE
D: Call the two hundred.
E: O.S.
N: THE POKER TABLE Lancey puts in his money and so does Sokal.
C: SOKAL
D: I'm sticking.
N: THE POKER TABLE Shooter deals another round: an eight of clubs to Sokal, a second seven to Pig, a ten to Lancey.
C: SHOOTER
D: Possible straight flush, pair of sevens. Pair of jacks are still high.
C: LANCEY
D: Check to the sevens.
C: SOKAL
D: Likewise.
C: PIG
D: Bet the size of the pot. Nine hundred and eighty dollars.
E: trying to be casual
C: LANCEY
D: In for nine eighty.
C: SOKAL
D: I'll play.
N: TWO SHOT - HOBAN AND BILL
C: BILL
D: What's with Lancey? I thought he'd raise with three jacks or drop with two pair.
C: HOBAN
D: He probably thinks Pig's faking the queens. Anyhow, Doc's liable take them both with a straight or a flush.
N: THE POKER TABLE There is a good deal of suspense hanging on each card as The Shooter deals. Sokal gets a five of diamonds, and his disappointment is too great to conceal.
C: SHOOTER
D: Busted, no flush, no straight. Pair of sevens with a queen gets a nine. To the pair of jacks, a trey.
C: PIG
D: Pair of sevens will bet whatever I got here. Twenty-four hundred bucks.
E: counting his money, trying to be calm
C: LANCEY
D: I'll call your twenty-four hundred --
N: CLOSE SHOT - THE KID He watches Lancey, puzzled; this isn't what he had expected.
C: LANCEY'S VOICE
D: -- and raise you whatever I have left.
E: O.S.
N: The Kid relaxes; this is more the way he figured it. THE POKER TABLE Lancey is completely calm. Pig is shattered, his whole world suddenly blown apart.
C: LANCEY
D: Comes to fourteen hundred fifty dollars, Pig. Don't imagine you'll have any problem promoting that much in half an hour -- plus whatever you care to raise me.
N: All eyes are on Pig, which doesn't make it any easier for him. He just sits there, his hands shaking.
C: SHOOTER
D: Fourteen fifty to the queens. You want to take your half hour, Pig?
N: There is another long moment before Pig flips over his up cards.
C: PIG
D: No, I'm out. Out of the game.
N: He looks at Lancey with malevolence. Lancey turns over his up cards and tosses them in front of The Shooter. Pig suddenly lunges toward the cards, wanting a look at Lancey's hole card, but Lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards into the pack The Shooter is assembling.
C: SHOOTER
D: You Tap City?
E: to Pig
N: Pig is suffering, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of making the dread admission. Finally he nods. The Shooter takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake, and the other four remaining players each add a ten. The Shooter pushes the money toward Pig.
C: PIG
D: I got a woman.
C: SHOOTER
D: I thought you and Hilda were quits.
C: PIG
D: We're back.
N: The other players look at The Shooter to see if he is going to accept this statement at face value. He nods, that he does, and each man contributes another ten. The Shooter passes the second fifty to Pig.
C: SHOOTER
D: See you around, Pig.
C: PLAYERS
D: So long, Pig -- See you -- 'Night.
E: ad lib
C: PIG
D: So long.
E: getting up
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS him to the door. The spectators make room for him, no one saying anything. At the door, Pig turns back for his valedictory gesture.
C: PIG
D: Good luck -- Kid.
N: He goes out. CLOSE SHOT - LANCEY He has been rearranging his money, but Pig's words make his head jerk up and toward the door. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the other players, who react in dismay to the breach of form.
C: SHOOTER
D: He shouldn't have said that. Not after taking Tap City from the table.
C: KID
D: His woman's been giving him a rough time. Wants him to quit and go square.
C: SOKAL
D: At his age? Crazy.
C: LANCEY
D: He wants to wish anybody luck, doesn't bother me. Personally, I don't figure The Kid needs it.
C: KID
D: Thanks, Lancey.
N: With that, the tension is gone. But just to make sure, The Shooter pushes his chair back.
C: SHOOTER
D: I know it's early, men, but what about taking a little break?
N: (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. POKER SUITE - BILL, MELBA AND THE SHOOTER
N: Melba fills a beer glass from a bottle and serves it to The Shooter.
C: BILL
D: It always distresses me, a man reaching his middle years and still having no assurance of next week's income.
E: to Melba
C: MELBA
D: I know what you mean. I like a man to have plenty of assurance.
N: The Shooter's gaze wanders o.s. CAMERA MOVES to FEATURE the objects of his attention, who are Lady Fingers, Lancey and The Kid. The two men would like to talk to each other, but Lady Finger's is monopolizing Lancey, and he doesn't want to offend her.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Spider Man died kind of slow. First he give them a kidney, then his gall bladder, and then they taking his whole damn stomach. You remember Spider Man, run the dice table down at Turk's Club to Memphis.
C: LANCEY
D: Who? Oh, Spider Man, sure, sure.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: He died kind of slow.
N: The Shooter comes to Lancey's rescue.
C: SHOOTER
D: Need your help, Lady Fingers... to make arrangements for food and shelter.
N: He whisks her away. Lancey and The Kid, finally facing each other alone, don't quite know how to begin.
C: LANCEY
D: Good crowd.
C: KID
D: Yeah. Nice-looking broads.
C: LANCEY
D: That's a fact.
C: KID
D: That was a pretty thing to watch what you done to Pig with those jacks.
C: LANCEY
D: Thanks, Kid. From you, that's nice to hear.
C: KID
D: When he bet out first, he was ready to think you had them back to back. Even when he bet the size of the pot, he figured there was still a chance you were laying for him. But when you called him, I could see it in his eyes he thought you had jacks and tens, and I knew you had him hooked.
C: LANCEY
D: You knew, did you? Before I raised?
C: KID
D: Oh, sure, I seen what you were pulling all along.
N: Lancey is a bit taken aback by The Kid's confident assertion, but he manages a smile.
C: LANCEY
D: You been to Miami, Kid?
C: KID
D: Not yet.
C: LANCEY
D: Beautiful town, lot of loose money around. You ought to come down some time.
C: KID
D: You mean it?
C: LANCEY
D: Sure, sure. Lot of room down there. Another spot you ought to work someday is Reno, Nevada.
C: KID
D: I heard.
C: LANCEY
D: You got to have nerves though. So much going on. Action everywhere you turn. You lose the feel of the cards when you're in so much action day in, day out.
C: KID
D: I'd like to make it out there.
C: LANCEY
D: There's different levels of action there -- you'd find yours, any kind you could ask for.
C: KID
D: I generally stick to stud.
C: LANCEY
D: Sure, sure, for eating money. But you know how it is, I like to lay off once in a while and try craps. Nothing serious -- I don't even think of it as work.
C: KID
D: Oh, I do that. I'll take a night off and shoot a little casino. Or even blackjack.
C: LANCEY
D: Your age, you don't need a regular vacation every year. But me, I have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks. I go to this place near Delray Beach, and the whole time I don't play anything but bridge.
C: KID
D: That's interesting. I could go for bridge if there was a way to do it without partners.
C: LANCEY
D: I'm not keeping you from your woman, am I?
C: KID
D: No. We're -- she's gone away for a while. We're not sure we're looking for the same thing.
E: after a slight hesitation
C: LANCEY
D: I'm sorry to hear that.
C: KID
D: I was hoping Christian would run with me and wouldn't try to make a big deal out of it.
C: LANCEY
D: But she tried?
C: KID
D: Yeah, and now I don't know. I don't figure a man can change his way because the way I see it a man's lucky he's got something going for him that he can hold on to. A man can't change his way for a woman.
C: LANCEY
D: Nooo, a man can't do that.
C: KID
D: I been wondering if it isn't maybe a better idea not to look for a fixed thing. Just tie in to something nice when you're away from the action, and enjoy it, and let it wear itself out.
C: LANCEY
D: That's very interesting you should say that. You're pretty young to have figured things out already.
E: after a long moment
C: KID
D: Well she didn't understand how it was with me and ---
C: LANCEY
D: Between us?
E: warmly
C: KID
D: There ain't but a few people, I guess who would understand --
C: LANCEY
D: Kid, you're the best stud man I've seen in 35 years of action. You know that?
E: as The Kid doesn't finish
C: KID
D: Well -- thank you.
C: LANCEY
D: And when it comes to broads, which is getting to be an academic problem -- I can look back now to the two or three I ever considered I might want to spend the rest of my life with, and you know what? I like it... looking back on them, that is -- I always got a lot of companionship out of a good book.
E: then
C: KID
D: It's very educational, hearing what it's like for a man your age.
C: LANCEY
D: Glad to be of help. And it's good we had this little talk so I know we can be friends regardless what happens.
C: KID
D: That sounds good to me. I didn't think you was coming in at me like a grudge match.
C: LANCEY
D: No room for any kind of emotion in a fair game of stud. I learned that a long time ago.
C: LADY FINGERS' VOICE
D: Ready for some action, gentlemen.
E: O.S.
N: They look at each other and then exit. ANGLE INCLUDING THE POKER TABLE Lady Fingers is sitting in Shooter's place, rippling and shuffling the cards. Yeller, Sokal, and The Shooter are all either sitting at the table or standing near it. Lancey, followed by The Kid, returns to the table.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: It's a whole New Deal. Good hands all around. Prosperity for everybody.
C: LANCEY
D: You're still good, Fingers.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Getting crippled up, Lancey. Not many of the old gang left. You heard Whistling Sam was gone?
C: LANCEY
D: No, I didn't hear.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: I was the one got called to the morgue to identify him. I don't suppose you seen anybody been run over by a twelve- ton bulldozer.
C: LANCEY
D: No, can't say that I have.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Don't go out of your way.
N: (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. POKER SUITE - TOWARD WINDOWS
N: Morning sunlight is streaming in. THE POKER TABLE The Kid, facing the sun, wears his eyeshade. The Shooter has resumed the deal and now hands out last cards to Sokal, The Kid and himself.
C: SHOOTER
D: Bet the pot. Four hundred and twenty dollars.
C: SOKAL
D: Fold.
C: KID
D: It's yours.
C: SHOOTER
D: Thanks, gents. Makes me exactly even. This kind of a game, that's a smart place to quit. Just do the dealing, if that's all right with everybody.
E: takes his money off the table
N: (TIME LAPSE) THE POKER TABLE It is later in the morning. Three players are left in the hand on the last card: Yeller with nothing higher than a jack, Lancey with a king-queen showing and Sokal with an ace- king.
C: SHOOTER
D: Ace-king is the high man.
C: SOKAL
D: Shoot the works. Nine hundred and thirty bucks.
E: counts it out
C: YELLER
D: I'm over.
C: LANCEY
D: What have you got?
E: putting out the money
C: SOKAL
D: Doesn't matter. If you can call me, you beat me. Ace-king high.
E: unhappily
C: LANCEY
D: Ace-king-queen high.
E: turning an ace
C: YELLER
D: I had them both with a pair of fives.
E: to The Kid
C: SOKAL
D: Winds it up for me, men. And I can't say it's been a pleasure. That one I was sure I could steal.
E: despairingly
C: YELLER
D: Lancey has a built-in burglar alarm. I'm also withdrawing from the field of battle, gentlemen. Settle for the seventeen hundred I've already dropped.
N: Yeller pulls in the money in front of him. There is now about $19,500 left on the table, $11,500 in front of Lancey, $8,000 in front of The Kid.
C: LANCEY
D: Well, just the two of us.
E: to The Kid
C: KID
D: Yeah, just the two of us. Deal them, Shooter Man.
N: (TIME LAPSE) THE POKER TABLE There is around $1,500 in the pot. Shooter deals an unhelpful card to Lancey's pair of aces, and a nine to The Kid's king- queen-ten.
C: KID
D: Cost you a grand.
C: LANCEY
D: Compulsory call, Kid.
N: The Kid turns up a jack and pulls in the money. (TIME LAPSE) THE POKER TABLE The last bet has been made and there is about $3000 in the pot. Lancey exposes his hole card.
C: LANCEY
D: Two pair, jacks up.
C: KID
D: Kings up.
N: He takes in the money. (TIME LAPSE) THE POKER TABLE There is $2500 in the pot. Lancey shows a pair of kings, The Kid an ace and three odd cards. The Shooter deals a nine to Lancey. THE KID He is watching The Shooter intently. FEATURING THE SHOOTER'S HANDS - KID'S P.O.V. The dealing motion looks perfectly legitimate as The Shooter gives The Kid an ace. Lancey's hand reaches into the SHOT to turn over his up cards.
C: LANCEY'S VOICE
D: Studded again.
E: O.S.
N: THE KID He takes the money in slowly, his eyes on The Shooter. Now the distribution of money has been reversed. The Kid has something under $12,000, Lancey something under $8,000. THE SHOOTER He avoids meeting The Kid's gaze. (TIME LAPSE) THE POKER TABLE - FROM BEHIND THE KID On the fourth card Lancey shows a pair of sevens, The Kid a pair of eights and a ten.
C: LANCEY
D: Two thousand dollars.
N: The Kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten.
C: KID
D: Call two thousand.
N: He turns to watch The Shooter. FEATURING THE SHOOTER'S HANDS - KID'S P.O.V. Again there is no indication of improper dealing as The Shooter gives Lancey an odd card and The Kid a ten, completing his full house.
C: LANCEY'S VOICE
D: Two thousand more.
E: O.S.
N: THE POKER TABLE
C: KID
D: Take it. I can't beat three sevens. I'd like a break to get some food and sleep -- I'm winners so it isn't up to me to say it but I'm saying it anyway.
E: then as The Shooter's eyes flicker with surprise
N: He exits. After a moment The Shooter follows. Lancey watches them go then rises, apparently still fresh and strong. Lady Fingers joins him.
C: LANCEY
D: My dear, that young man is a stud poker-playing son-of-a-bitch.
E: pleasantly
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Gettin' to you, Lancey?
N: Lancey looks at her a moment, then smiles.
C: LANCEY
D: Not yet he isn't.
E: softly
N: He moves through the crowd, then exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - BILL'S SUITE - THE KID & SHOOTER
N: They are alone in the room. Shooter is uncomfortable and would like to be elsewhere but The Kid is standing in front of the closed door.
C: THE KID
D: Now, just what the hell are you trying to pull?
C: SHOOTER
D: Nothing -- what are you talking about?
E: trying to bluff it
N: The Kid grabs him and slams him against the wall.
C: THE KID
D: You, Shooter Man -- you been feeding me cards for an hour.
C: SHOOTER
D: The hell I was. Christ, Kid, even if I was you couldn't spot it -- I'm too good a mechanic for anybody to spot it.
E: angry and ashamed he waits a brief moment then eases away from The Kid
C: THE KID
D: But I was looking for it, Shooter -- four times you give me the cards I need.
E: grabbing him and slamming him against the wall again
C: SHOOTER
D: You seen it before often enough. One player draws four good ones.
E: a little shrill
C: THE KID
D: Never in a game when I been told ahead the dealer has a stake in my coming out on top.
C: SHOOTER
D: My woman told you.
E: slumping
C: THE KID
D: She told me enough to make me start thinking.
C: SHOOTER
D: Why should you bitch if I give you a little help?
E: almost pleading
C: THE KID
D: Why, you dumb bastard? -- You have to ask me why. I could break you apart for what you've done.
E: ready to hit him
C: SHOOTER
D: Kid, you got to understand. It wasn't my idea --
E: backing off
C: THE KID
D: Well who the hell's was it then -- Schlaegel? --
C: SHOOTER
D: He's got the squeeze on me Kid and he's meaner than hell. He'll cut me up if I don't come through. You think I wanted to deal a phony game? You think it don't mean something to me? I never done a crooked thing before in my life.
E: then
C: THE KID
D: My ass bleeds for you -- Now you get straight on this. No fix. You come along straight or I blow it wide open.
C: SHOOTER
D: He's liable to kill me.
C: THE KID
D: He ain't goin' to do nothin' to you except pay off because I'm goin' to win.
C: SHOOTER
D: It is a hell of a chance to take.
C: THE KID
D: You got no choice.
C: SHOOTER
D: He ain't goin' to like it.
C: THE KID
D: He ain't goin' to know. Shooter, I'm goin' to win this one -- win it my way -- and you ride with me or you're out, finished.
E: almost yelling at him then quietly
C: SHOOTER
D: I ride with you.
C: THE KID
D: You better not forget it -- now beat it. I need some sleep.
N: Shooter looks at him, then moves towards the door.
C: THE KID
D: Tell Mr. Schlaegel I accept his offer to use the room.
N: The Shooter goes out. The Kid crosses to the phone.
C: THE KID
D: I want to be called at 4 p.m. on the nose. For sure -- Thanks.
E: into phone
T: CUT TO
S: INT. LANCEY'S ROOM
N: In the privacy of his room he shows how close he is to exhaustion. Wearily, he sits on the bed and begins to remove his shoes. Then, catching his reflection in the mirror, straightens.
C: LANCEY
D: Not yet he isn't. But he damn well might.
T: CUT TO
S: INT. BEDROOM, BILL'S SUITE - CLOSE SHOT - MELBA
N: She is in the final stages of undressing. CAMERA MOVES with her as she steps to The Kid's bedside and gets into bed with him. Having accomplished this without waking him, she speaks into his ear in imitation of a hotel phone operator.
C: MELBA
D: Good afternoon, sir. It's exactly four o'clock.
N: He awakens in considerable confusion. Melba is amused by his difficulty in adjusting to his circumstances.
C: MELBA
D: It's really only about twenty-five to four. You can stay right where you are.
C: THE KID
D: I don't want you to think I'm getting too personal, but you mind telling me how the hell you come to be here?
C: MELBA
D: You mean you don't remember last night? We drank all that champagne and you said "Let's get married right away," and we chartered a plane to --
C: THE KID
D: Can it -- Where's Shooter?
E: then
C: MELBA
D: I locked the door. It's incredible the way you invariably worry about The Shooter.
C: THE KID
D: It's incredible the way you invariably don't.
C: MELBA
D: Worrying takes time and we don't have a lot.
C: THE KID
D: We're supposed to sit down again at half past four.
C: MELBA
D: Does it really matter so much to you now, that sense of obligation to The Shooter?
C: THE KID
D: I got no obligations to The Shooter. Or to you.
E: thinking about Shooter then to Melba
C: MELBA
D: Obligations are not what I have in mind.
T: CUT TO
S: INT. LANCEY'S ROOM
N: He is shaving. Apparently much stronger but his hand is shaking. He looks at it. It steadies. After a moment he smiles a little.
T: CUT TO
S: INT. BATHROOM, BILL'S SUITE
N: CAMERA is on the shower door as the SOUND of running water ceases. The Kid can be seen indistinctly through the door.
C: THE KID
D: Reach me a towel?
N: Melba, who is dressed again and applying her lipstick, comes into the SHOT, takes a towel from a rack and hands it to him after he opens the shower door. He gives himself a quick once-over with it, the secures it around his waist, steps out of the shower stall, and begins the process of shaving. Melba meanwhile finishes restoring her makeup.
C: MELBA
D: You any idea how much The Shooter has involved in this game of yours?
C: THE KID
D: If Schlaegel bet as much on me as I heard, I guess he'd pay a nice piece of change to be sure I won.
C: MELBA
D: It's worse than that. Schlaegel staked him for three years. He has his hooks so deep in Shooter Man, he'll take out his liver when he pulls them out.
N: The Kid stops shaving and looks at her.
C: THE KID
D: You asking me to go along with the fix?
C: MELBA
D: I'm asking you to consider whether your ego is worth destroying another man's whole life.
C: THE KID
D: You're still working for him. On my time you're still working for him.
C: MELBA
D: What kind of switch is this? You criticize me for trying to chippie on him, then I get a little loyal and you're at me for that.
C: THE KID
D: No -- I don't hold it against you. You wanting to make things right for him -- but this game I handle my way -- win, lose, or draw.
N: There is a KNOCK on the door.
C: MELBA
D: Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed hero.
N: CAMERA PANS to take in the view of the bedroom as she crosses it to the door, talking as she goes.
C: MELBA
D: Believe me Kid there is too much at stake for us to rely on your doing it on your own.
N: She has paused at the door to finish her sentence. Now she unlocks and opens it -- to Christian. Melba is so taken aback she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open. The Kid, in the bathroom in f.g., is similarly frozen in his tracks. After a moment Christian advances into the room. REVERSE ANGLE - CHRISTIAN IN F.G. The scene as it looks to Christian is circumstantially incriminating. CAMERA MOVES with her gaze from The Kid to the one mussed bed, to Melba. The faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Hello, Kid. Hello, Melba. You said wait home 'til you let me know.
E: a pause
C: THE KID
D: Yeah, that's what I said. We took a break in the game to catch some sleep. Shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up.
C: MELBA
D: Yeah, I woke him up.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It don't take much.
C: MELBA
D: No, I didn't find it any trouble. Well, you children don't need me, that's for sure. See you downstairs. You, too, honey, right?
E: awkwardly to Christian
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I'll be around if The Kid wants me.
C: THE KID
D: See you, Melba. Thanks.
C: MELBA
D: Por nada, as they say. It was nothing.
N: She walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and puts on his shorts and trousers.
C: THE KID
D: You been to the place?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: No, I've got my bag downstairs. Maybe I'll take it over later on tonight.
C: THE KID
D: How's your Mama and Papa?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Fine. How's the game going?
N: The Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off the soap.
C: THE KID
D: It's come to be just me and Lancey.
N: He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. As his movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting his shirt on.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I was wondering.
E: after the kiss
C: THE KID
D: I got my mind on the cards.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I know. And I don't want to rattle you. We got plenty to talk about, but it can all wait. Except I want to say this. I came back because I figured if it was going to work with us, it's silly me sitting home with Mama while you're playing your big game. I mean if I'm any use to you at all, this is when it's most important.
N: To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both affection and guilt. The idea that she can be any use to him against Lancey is one he can't grasp.
C: THE KID
D: I'm glad you came, Christian. You got as much right here as anybody. More right, I should have said.
E: then
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Should you?
C: THE KID
D: Hell, yes. The change I come out with when I win this one, you're going to be the one to spend it.
N: He moves toward the door.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Eric --
C: THE KID
D: Look, I said I'm glad you came -- and that's all until I wrap this up -- I'm a poker player, remember?
E: turning back
N: She looks at him. After a moment he exits. She follows.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE POKER TABLE It is evening. Lady Fingers deals a first up card to the two players. The Kid gets an eight, Lancey a jack.
C: THE KID
D: The eight'll try two bills.
C: LANCEY
D: No stay.
E: turning his card
N: Lady Fingers scoops up the cards, shuffles them into the rest of the deck, submits it to Lancey for his cut, and deals them another two cards apiece -- all in the space of seconds. The Kid gets a queen, Lancey a nine.
C: THE KID
D: Two hundred.
C: LANCEY
D: No stay.
E: turning his card
S: INT. POKER SUITE
N: CAMERA starts on Yeller, who is stretched out on the loveseat with his eyes closed and PANS UP to INCLUDE Hoban, who sits at the observation post with the binoculars. Yeller speaks without opening his eyes.
C: YELLER
D: Anything?
C: HOBAN
D: Naaa, Kid paired kings. He wins a hundred.
N: CAMERA MOVES on PAST a window, showing it is night outside; past a group of other spectators; past Bill, Shooter and Melba who watch the game grimly; and finally to the table, where The Shooter is dealing again. The Kid is down to his undershirt, and even Lancey has made a few concessions to comfort. The players have just been dealt their third cards. Christian moves up to stand behind The Kid.
C: LANCEY
D: Queen bets another C-note.
C: THE KID
D: Take it away.
E: folding
N: He looks up at Christian.
C: THE KID
D: Go read a magazine, honey.
N: She hesitates. Then moves away. Lancey watches this. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. POKER SUITE - CHRISTIAN
N: It is later at night. The magazine lies open on Christian's lap; she is staring absently into space.
C: LADY FINGERS' VOICE
D: All right, gents. I'm declaring a break.
E: O.S.
N: The announcement rouses Christian from her reverie. THE POKER TABLE Lady Fingers is in the dealer's chair. The two players look pretty weary.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: I break.
C: THE KID
D: I don't want a break.
C: LANCEY
D: Well, I don't either.
C: THE KID
D: Deal.
N: Lady Fingers puts down the deck. Picks up a new one.
C: LANCEY
D: Same deck is good enough.
E: snapping
C: THE KID
D: I want a new deck.
C: LANCEY
D: Alright, alright -- A new deck then, Jesus.
C: THE KID
D: Deal.
N: Lady Fingers looks at the two men for a long moment. Puts the cards down.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: You want to deal? Then deal them yourselves. I'm going to the john. I'm going to get something to eat, and I'm going to take a nap. You barracudas can snap all you want but at each other -- I'm taking a break and if you don't like it you can both go to hell.
N: She turns and stalks off. Lancey and The Kid look at each other for a moment, then both grin.
C: THE KID
D: I guess we been told.
C: LANCEY
D: Looks that way.
C: THE KID
D: See you in about 3/4 of an hour, Lancey, right?
E: rising
C: LANCEY
D: Make it an hour. Old bones need a little more time to loosen up.
C: THE KID
D: Listen, I think it is amazing you've been able to keep going this long.
E: meaning it
N: As he heads for the door, Lancey reacts to this. Then stands and looks around the room. Groups of people stand in the shadows watching silently, not hostile but certainly not friendly. He is The Man but he is getting beat and nobody is sorry. After a moment he turns and leaves from a side door. CAMERA PANS to HOLD on Christian as she stops The Kid by the door.
S: INT. POKER SUITE
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Eric --
E: taking his hand
C: SHOOTER
D: Your fan on the fifth floor wants you to have a bite with him. Alone.
E: simultaneously
C: KID
D: There's nothing to talk about.
C: SHOOTER
D: You better, Kid. You don't, you're only making worse trouble.
N: Christian scans both their faces as they talk... concerned.
C: THE KID
D: If you think so. Sorry.
E: to Christian
C: CHRISTIAN
D: What's wrong?
C: THE KID
D: Nothing, Nothing you have to worry about. I'll see you later.
N: He heads for the door. Christian looks after him.
C: THE KID
D: Get something to eat.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BILL'S SUITE
N: Bill and The Kid are sitting at a room-service table. Bill nibbles at some cheese and crackers while The Kid tackles a large steak. Felix, the chauffeur, stands in attendance on them.
C: BILL
D: I thought it would be better if you and I sat down together to see if we couldn't work out our differences. Felix!
N: He motions to Felix, indicating a wine bottle on the table. Felix steps over and refills The Kid's glass.
C: THE KID
D: What I told The Shooter goes.
C: BILL
D: Are you saying no before we've even discussed it? Am I to feel all my arguments will be wasted?
N: The Kid just looks at him -- then returns to his meal.
C: BILL
D: I'll skip to the final argument. More salad, perhaps?
E: then
N: He makes a peremptory gesture to Felix, who springs forward to offer the salad bowl to The Kid.
C: BILL
D: The Shooter will be back dealing when you start again. He will give you an occasional helpful card.
C: THE KID
D: That's an argument?
C: BILL
D: That's a fact. I'm coming to the argument.
C: THE KID
D: I'll give you a fact. I won't let it happen.
C: BILL
D: Is that knife sharp enough? Felix.
N: Felix jumps into action again. He moves to The Kid's side, reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade, which he clocks open an inch or two from The Kid's neck. It is an extremely ugly-looking and menacing weapon.
C: BILL
D: See if it cuts better with that.
N: Felix hands the knife to The Kid, who tries it on his steak.
C: BILL
D: Sharp?
C: THE KID
D: Very. But it don't cut any ice with me.
N: He jams the knife in the table and snaps off the blade.
C: THE KID
D: Not this time. He exits.
E: rising
S: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
N: As The Kid exits Christian is waiting for him. He moves down the corridor, preoccupied. She follows.
C: THE KID
D: Did you eat?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: No.
C: THE KID
D: Why not, for Chris sakes?
E: stops, looks at her irritated
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Eric --

D: You should eat something.
E: moving away
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I've got to talk to you.
E: loudly, stopping
N: He stops, looks at her.
C: THE KID
D: Talk.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It's -- about us. What's going to happen?
E: fumbling
C: THE KID
D: What's going to happen? What's going to happen for Chris sake is I'm going to win the game. You go back to the apartment, honey, this might take two more days.
E: interrupting then more softly
C: CHRISTIAN
D: If I go, I'm not going back to the apartment. If I go -- I'm just going.
E: flatly
C: THE KID
D: Well, that's up to you, Christian.
E: after a long moment
N: He looks at her a moment longer then moves up the corridor. She watches him, then turns. Standing in the open door some distance away are Schlaegel and Felix.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. POKER SUITE - THE SHOOTER'S HANDS
N: Shuffling the cards. CAMERA PULLS BACK enough to see his face as he looks across at The Kid. CAMERA PANS to a CLOSE SHOT of The Kid, and then past a couple of spectators, including Christian and Melba, to Bill, whose eyes are on The Kid. Finally CAMERA PANS back to The Kid.
C: THE KID
D: I told you, Shooter -- I won't go for it.
N: THE POKER TABLE - INCLUDING BILL Both The Shooter and Bill are aware of a portentous note in The Kid's tone.
C: LANCEY
D: What's up?
C: THE KID
D: The Shooter's not well. He didn't want to spoil the game, but he ought to be resting... He ought to be in the hospital.
C: LANCEY
D: Well, we got Lady Fingers. Or we can deal ourselves.
C: SHOOTER
D: I'm okay. What The Kid's talking about is nothing. It's just not important.
C: THE KID
D: It is to me... You want to kill yourself, do it on your own time.
N: Lancey looks from The Kid to The Shooter, sensing that there may be something more behind this, but not knowing just what.
C: LANCEY
D: I got to go along with that, Shooter. Lady Fingers! You ready?
N: CLOSE SHOT - LADY FINGERS Rising from her chair.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Like Eddie the Dude said on his deathbed, I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
N: (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. POKER SUITE - CLOSE SHOT - THE KID AND POKER HAND
N: The four cards showing are the ace, ten and two little clubs. As CAMERA PULLS BACK we also have time to note The Kid's stake. He is still ahead. Lancey counts out five hundred dollars from his stake, leaving about thirteen thousand, and puts it into a pot that already contains around a thousand.
C: LANCEY
D: I can't persuade myself you have the flush.
N: The Kid turns up the jack of clubs.
C: LANCEY
D: Now I can.
N: The Kid pulls in the money. (TIME LAPSE)
S: INT. POKER SUITE - THE KID - LANCEY - AND POKER HANDS
N: Both men are showing the strain. Perhaps Lancey the most as he appears to be consistently losing. Showing are two nines and two odd cards.
C: LANCEY'S VOICE
D: I'm going to pay the price to look at that third nine.
E: O.S.
N: The kid turns up another nine and reaches for the money.
C: LANCEY'S VOICE
D: Caveat emptor. New deck, please.
E: O.S.
N: (TIME LAPSE) THE POKER TABLE - FROM BEHIND THE KID He shows a pair of eights and two odd cards against Lancey's pair of queens. He takes another look at his hole card, and we see that it is of no help to him.
C: THE KID
D: Pair of eights bets an even thousand dollars.
N: HOBAN AND YELLER They are both sitting on the back of the loveseat now. The binoculars pass from one to the other. Both men are tense over the growing excitement of the game.
C: YELLER
D: Ten bucks and my notoriously fallible instinct tells me the boy is bluffing this time.
C: HOBAN
D: Mark it.
N: CAMERA MOVES to the other four remaining spectators: Christian, Melba, The Shooter and Bill. They are close enough to see the cards but too close to discuss them. THE POKER TABLE The kid has almost half the money in front of him now, and is playing with increasing assurance and pressure.
C: LANCEY
D: I'm not that curious.
E: turning his cards
N: HOBAN AND YELLER
C: HOBAN
D: The Kid is pushing it and making it stick.
E: excitement in his voice
N: CAMERA MOVES to the other four spectators as they react to The Kid's successful streak.
C: SHOOTER
D: He's getting to him.
E: in a low voice
N: And it looks that way. Lancey appears old and unsure. The Kid sharp and cold. A young barracuda moving in for the kill. CAMERA MOVES in close to Christian as she tries to catch The Kid's eye. Thinking she has it, she smiles her encouragement. FEATURING THE KID He looks right at her and doesn't seem to see her. Lady Fingers has dealt the first up cards of a new hand, and Lancey is high.
C: LANCEY
D: Two hundred.
C: THE KID
D: And up five.
C: LANCEY
D: Fold.
N: CLOSE - CHRISTIAN Amid the growing excitement and tension she is a complete outsider. (TIME LAPSE) THE POKER TABLE The Kid shows two jacks and two odd cards; Lancey a pair of aces and two odd cards. Lancey puts about eight hundred dollars into the pot.
C: LANCEY
D: Betting the jack isn't there, Kid.
N: The Kid exposes his hidden jack. SHOOTER, BILL AND MELBA Greed and an almost vicious satisfaction marks their faces as they watch Lancey falter. The Shooter whispers to Bill just loud enough for the girl to hear.
C: SHOOTER
D: We're in -- I think he's got him.
N: Christian looks at them, then at The Kid. Hesitates a moment then suddenly gets to her feet and starts for the door. Only Melba notices her, and even she doesn't have time to question her. CAMERA FOLLOWS Christian to the suite entrance, where she picks up her bag then turns to look back at the table. FEATURING THE KID The place where Christian was sitting is right in his line of vision but he hasn't observed her departure. CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN She goes on out the door.
S: INT. POKER SUITE - ANGLE INCLUDING WINDOW
N: The second dawn of the contest is near at hand. The room, continuously lived in for so long by so many people, is a shambles of dirty glasses and plates, empty bottles, full wastebaskets and ash trays, and frayed people. At the poker table, Lady Fingers is dealing a new hand.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: A jack and a ten. Jack bets.
N: CAMERA MOVES in close enough for us to see the cards. Lancey has the jack of hearts, The Kid the ten of clubs.
C: LANCEY
D: Jack is willing to wager two hundred dollars.
N: The Kid takes his first look at his hole card. CLOSE SHOT - SHOWING FACE OF HOLE CARD It is the queen of hearts.
C: THE KID
D: And up five hundred.
N: Lancey looks at him a long moment. His face pale and shaken. The Kid is beating him. Pushing -- buying -- always pressing and Lancey knows he is losing one hand at a time, not badly but consistently and inevitably. His age and fatigue are a strong handicap for the long pull. Then his face settles as if he had come to a decision. He smiles lightly summoning some last reserve of strength, almost as if he knows this will be the last hand, win or lose.
C: LANCEY
D: Call your five hundred and five hundred more.
C: THE KID
D: Call.
E: after a brief hesitation
N: HOBAN AND YELLER
C: HOBAN
D: Fifty to one hundred says Lancey paired his jacks.
C: YELLER
D: Mark it.
N: THE POKER TABLE Lady Fingers deals the ten of diamonds to The Kid, giving him a pair, and the ten of hearts to Lancey.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Pair of tens. Jack, ten of hearts.
C: THE KID
D: Five hundred.
C: LANCEY
D: Your five hundred -- and up one thousand.
N: The raise is a surprise. The Kid's eyes go up to study Lancey's face, even though he knows what a futile effort that is. HOBAN AND YELLER
C: HOBAN
D: Fifty to seventy-five he's got the jacks wired.
C: YELLER
D: Mark it -- Could be a high heart. Queen's the best, but that old man can be cocky with an ace or a deuce. 'Specially having one of The Kid's tens.
N: THE POKER TABLE
C: LADY FINGERS
D: One thousand to the tens.
C: THE KID
D: Call.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: A third ten, and a nine of hearts to the ten, jack.
E: dealing
N: SERIES OF ANGLES The Kid, Lancey, Shooter, Melba, Schlaegel, Yeller, Hoban and others as they realize this could be the big hand.
C: HOBAN
D: He'll run. He's beat on the board anyway you look at it. Even if he has the jacks it is better than eight to one against improving.
C: YELLER
D: He won't run and I don't think he's got the jacks. I think he's going for the flush.
C: THE KID
D: Two thousand, five hundred dollars.
E: after a moment
N: Lancey looks at him, then at the cards. The moment stretches.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Two thousand, five hundred dollars to the three hearts.
E: finally
N: Lancey looks at her. His face briefly showing his anger. The Kid notices this and reacts.
C: LANCEY
D: Reasonable bet. Two thousand five hundred. Deal them.
E: finally, casually he counts out the money to Lady Fingers
C: SHOOTER
D: He's going for it and The Kid's got him. He's going all the way.
E: knowing this is it
C: LADY FINGERS
D: A queen of diamonds to the three tens. And an eight of hearts to the possible flush. Possible straight flush. Three tens bet.
E: dealing a note of excitement in her voice
N: The Kid checks the amount of money in front of him. THE SHOOTER AND BILL They exchange a quick look of satisfaction, and then their eyes go back to the cards. HOBAN AND YELLER They each take a quick turn with the binoculars.
C: HOBAN
D: If The Kid bets into the flush he's filled up with a queen in the hole.
C: YELLER
D: If The Man has a flush or a straight, he goes under. But not with both.
E: then
N: FROM BEHIND THE KID He looks at his hole card. It is still the queen of hearts. He has a full house, which has to be the winning hand unless Lancey had the audacity to bet out with a jack-seven of hearts, and to raise The Kid with a jack-ten-seven.
C: THE KID
D: Bet what's in front of me. Make it fifty-four hundred bucks.
N: He counts out all his money except a few smaller bills. THE WATCHERS Reacting. FEATURING LANCEY He takes his time before he responds.
C: LANCEY
D: Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice piece of money. I see the bet and raise sixty-seven hundred.
E: counting it out
N: Slowly and deliberately, revealing nothing in his face, he reaches into his breast pocket and takes out a slim wallet and begins to let the bills flutter out on the table. The Kid looks at him frozen. THE SHOOTER AND BILL Bill hisses softly into The Shooter's ear.
C: BILL
D: Kid has him, doesn't he?
N: But The Shooter, like the Kid, is white-faced and frozen by the raise. THE REMAINING SPECTATORS They crowd in close to the table: Hoban, Yeller, Bill, The Shooter, and Melba.
C: KID
D: I'm taking my half hour to raise my stake.
E: after a long moment
C: LADY FINGERS
D: I declare a thirty-minute break. Leave your cards and money on the table. The game will start again at five forty-five.
C: LANCEY
D: I'll take your marker, Kid.
C: KID
D: I can raise it.
C: LANCEY
D: I know you can.
C: KID
D: Long as you know. -- Call.
E: he raps the table
C: LANCEY
D: Straight flush to the jack -- That's $6700 you owe me, Kid.
E: turns up a heart seven
N: CLOSE SHOT - THE KID There is nothing to be gained from a poker face now, and he reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated strain and fatigue is beginning to show. CAMERA MOVES among the spectators: Hoban and Yeller, who are sorry for The Kid and admiring of Lancey; Bill, who is all the more angry at his defeat because his hopes were up; The Shooter, who is a very unhappy man; and Melba, whose anger at the Kid is balanced by her fear of Schlaegel and what will happen to The Shooter and possibly to her. THE POKER TABLE Lancey pulls in the money while The Kid stares at him dumbly. Lady Fingers riffles the cards.
C: LANCEY
D: New deck.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Are you playing, Kid? You got a half an hour to raise your stake.
C: KID
D: No -- I'm through.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Gentlemen, this game is over.
E: formally
C: LANCEY
D: You're one hell of a poker player, Kid. That was a rough hand.
C: KID
D: Thanks.
C: LANCEY
D: What's the tab for the whole show?
N: As he settles up, the CAMERA FOLLOWS The Kid to his brandy bottle. As he pours himself a slug, Melba and Shooter join him. CLOSER ANGLE
C: MELBA
D: You had to do it, didn't you -- you had to go for it your own way. Well, sonny, I hope you learned something. I know we sure as hell did.
E: then, as The Kid doesn't answer
C: KID
D: Where's Christian?
C: MELBA
D: She's gone. She's got too much sense to stick with a two bit loser.
C: SHOOTER
D: Shut up. Sorry, Kid.
E: then:
C: KID
D: Yeah. I should have known he had it, Shooter Man. I walked into it.
E: then:
C: SHOOTER
D: Well, Kid, it's like I said -- you just wasn't ready.
E: trying to grin as Schlaegel and Felix move up
C: BILL
D: Are you ready, Shooter Man? We're having a meeting and I suggest you join us.
E: to The Shooter
N: Shooter looks at him a moment and nods, and taking Melba by the arm, moves toward the door followed by Felix.
C: MELBA
D: Why me -- I'm not part of this.
C: SHOOTER
D: Oh, yes you are -- you and your big mouth -- you're part of it all right.
E: jerking her forward
C: SCHLAEGEL
D: He's right, my dear. Now run along with Felix. We're going to have a long talk about that big mouth of yours.
N: Melba starts to protest, but Felix jerks her out the door. Shooter hesitates, then follows. DIFFERENT ANGLE Schlaegel turns to The Kid.
C: SCHLAEGEL
D: I was wrong. I figured you for brains. But you're a loser, Kid. You had a chance to play with grownups and you ran. They weren't playing your game. They were playing mine. Think about that while you find a place to hide. But hide good, Kid -- because I got a message for you and I'm going to see it delivered.
E: then, as Lancey and Lady Fingers approach
N: The Kid looks at him, looks at Lancey and Lady Fingers, wondering about what Schlaegel has said, angry about it.
C: THE KID
D: Any time.
N: Schlaegel nods, moves to the door. NEW ANGLE Lancey and Lady Fingers join The Kid.
C: LADY FINGERS
D: Never thought I'd see the day. You raising tens on a lousy three-flush.
C: LANCEY
D: Gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it? Making the wrong play at the right time.
C: THE KID
D: That's what it's all about? You were crazy -- odds are three hundred to one against.
E: sharply then, as Lancey looks at him and doesn't answer
C: LANCEY
D: I don't play a percentage game. I play stud poker my way. And I got the money and you got the questions. Figure that out. You're good. But as long as I'm around, you're second best, Kid... and you might as well learn to live with it.
E: after a moment then, not unkindly
N: The Kid looks at him and doesn't answer.
C: LANCEY
D: Look me up if you're in Miami after Christmas. Stillson Hotel.
N: He smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door. SCENE Lancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their congratulations. The Kid watches for a moment then takes a long drink out of the bottle and eases through the crowd and out the door.
S: INT. CORRIDOR
N: as The Kid moves down the hall and enters the elevator.
S: INT. LOBBY
N: as he moves through the almost deserted lobby into the street.
S: EXT. ST. LOUIS STREET - DAWN EFFECT
N: SERIES OF ANGLES of the Kid walking alone through the city. During the above there is an impression someone is following him.
S: EXT. DESERTED STREET NEAR THE KID'S APARTMENT
N: He turns a corner and there is a man blocking his path. Suddenly three men move in behind him. He turns, trapped. CLOSER ANGLE The men are four of the original seven players he hustled in the opening scene. NOTE: During the progression of the game first one, then two, then all four men will be included among the observers. Always in the background, never positively identified. Their presence should be felt if not recognized.
C: DANNY
D: So it ain't Eric Stone, from the foundry. It's the Cincinnati Kid King of the stud poker players.
C: THE KID
D: No -- not the King -- not much of anything right now.
C: DANNY
D: We'll start with giving you back what you gave me.
E: moving towards him
N: He moves toward The Kid.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Eric --
E: O.S.
N: The men hesitate. NEW ANGLE as Christian gets out of a taxi.
C: DANNY
D: Tell her good-bye, sport. You ain't going any place.
E: as she moves toward them
C: THE KID
D: I know that.
N: He crosses to Christian.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Are you all right?
N: CLOSER ANGLE
C: THE KID
D: I'm fine. Weren't you going to say good-bye?
E: then
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I said good-bye.
C: THE KID
D: Yeah, I guess you did. You don't know if I won or lost do you?
E: then
C: CHRISTIAN
D: No -- it doesn't really matter. I love you, Kid -- and it's not enough.
E: then after a long moment
C: THE KID
D: Yeah, I know.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: Listen, Lady, it's coming on the morning rush. I got to have one fare after another or I'm behind for the day.
E: calling
N: Christian doesn't answer. She looks at The Kid for a long moment, then turns and goes. He watches her. She enters the cab and it leaves. The Kid just stands there. DIFFERENT ANGLE Danny and the others move up around him. The Kid ignores them. After a moment Danny swings from behind and knocks him to the pavement. He lies there stunned for a moment. They look down at him. Then he comes up. He flattens two in the process of being badly beaten. They leave him. DIFFERENT ANGLES as the city awakens. Finally, he stirs, stands and walks away.
T: FADE OUT
N: THE END
