M: and Jim DeFelice
N: All gave some. Some gave all. OVER BLACK The groan of tank treads drowns out THE CALL TO PRAYER as an entire MARINE COMPANY advances over the top of us.
S: EXT. STREET, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY
N: The sun melts over squat residences on a narrow street. MARINE COMPANY creeps toward us like a cautious Goliath. FOOT SOLDIERS walk alongside Humvees and tanks.
C: COMMANDING OFFICER
D: Charlie Bravo-3, we got eyes on you from the east. Clear to proceed, over.
E: OS radio chatter
S: EXT. ROOFTOP, "OVERWATCH" - SAME
N: Sun glints off a slab of corrugated steel. Beneath it-- CHRIS KYLE lays prone, dick in the dirt, eye to the glass of a .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle. He's Texas stock with a boyish grin, blondish goatee and vital blue eyes. Both those eyes are open as he tracks the scene below, sweating his ass off in the shade of steel.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: Fucking hot box.
N: GOAT (24, Arkansas Marine) lies beside him, woodsy and outspoken, watching dirt-devils swirl in the street.
C: GOAT
D: Dirt over here tastes like dog shit.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: I guess you'd know.
N: Goat balks and fixes his M4 on the rooftop door. CHRIS SCOPE POV TRACK ACROSS bombed-out buildings, twisted metal and golden-domed mosques. Ragged curtains flutter out a window. Cat-tails on the river sway the same direction. We see him studying windage; we see what he's thinking-- SFX: A LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ escalates over picture as his concentration deepens. Cross-hairs land on-- A MAN ON CELL PHONE watches the convoy from a rooftop. (03.18.14) 2.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over.
E: keys mike
C: COMMANDING OFFICER
D: If you think he's reporting troop movement you have a green-light. Your call. Over.
E: OS
C: GOAT
D: He could be calling his old lady.
E: OC
N: MAN ON CELL studies the convoy, his hair tossed by wind. CROSS-HAIR push left of target, compensating for windage. SFX: Chris takes a deep inhale, holds it, then expels. His finger is taking up trigger-slack when the man dips his shoulder slightly. Chris holds off as-- MAN ON CELL hangs up and steps away.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: He stepped off.
E: keys mike
N: Chris sucks air. Close. The ambient world floods back in. Barked orders, diesel engines and-- A WOMAN AND KID exit the same structure. They're headed up the sidewalk but cut sharply into the street.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving toward the convoy.
E: keys mike
N: (ECU)-- The woman cradles something beneath her robes.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something.
N: CROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical object from her robes. His vision obscured but--
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.
C: COMMANDING OFFICER
D: --you say a woman and kid? 3.
E: OS 03.18.14
N: SFX: his heart-beat, THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
C: COMMANDING OFFICER
D: Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call.
E: OS
C: GOAT
D: They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth.
E: OC
N: THE KID moves toward the convoy with the grenade.
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: Fuck--
E: OC
N: MOTHER motions the Kid to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her son's footsteps; all blowing the same direction. THE KID sprints toward the Marines. IN THE STREET YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt. CLOSE ON CHRIS His exhale hisses from tobacco-stained teeth. Breathe it down. He struggles to get calm, fighting for control. SFX: THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-- CROSS-HAIRS left of the running target, leading him, compensating for a dozen different considerations as-- He pauses upon exhale. The world goes quiet. Landscape pulses with color and focus. He stokes the trigger and-- THE BULLET Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of-- A WHITE-TAIL BUCK It staggers, draws and topples to the ground. We are--
S: EXT. HILLS, WEST TEXAS - PRE-DAWN
N: A field shrouded in fog. CHRIS KYLE(8) jumps from a deer blind, innocent and excited, running toward the buck. (03.18.14) 4.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Get back here.
N: Chris stops, turns back. WAYNE KYLE, his father, is sturdy and earnest with mutton chops and Texas calm.
C: WAYNE
D: Don't ever leave your gun in the dirt.
C: CHRIS
D: Yes, sir.
C: WAYNE
D: Helluva shot, son. You got a gift. You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.
N: Chris nods, clear-eyed, as if hearing the whisper of destiny. He grabs the .30-06, running again, bounding to-- THE BUCK Glassy brown eyes look up at Chris. It's still alive.
C: WAYNE
D: Everything dies to give life.
C: CHRIS
D: Can it see me?
C: WAYNE
D: It's a deer, son.
N: Chris processes his first kill, watching as-- (ECU) a flea crawls around the animal's inner-ear.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: You shot it, you deal with it.
E: hands him hunting knife
N: Chris straddles the deer. It tries to gouge him. He looks frightened but drags the blade across its neck.
S: INT. CHURCH
N: A Protestant church. CHRIS is dressed in Sunday best, shuffling pages of a LITTLE BLUE BIBLE to create breeze. (03.18.14) 5.
C: PASTOR
D: We don't see with his eyes so we don't know the glory of his plan. Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror. But on the day we rise, we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways--
N: JEFF(6), his reedy little brother, watches Chris slip the Bible in his pocket. Jeff laughs and gets smacked by-- DEBBIE, their mother. She wears big oval glasses and runs a wayward-boys home with that same steady hand.
S: INT. CHRIS' BEDROOM
N: Dust motes drift across a dresser, settling on a Pop- Warner football, that BLUE BIBLE, and METALLIC TOY SOLDIERS guarding the bullet casing from his first buck.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: There are three types of people in this world. Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs.
E: VO
N: PUSH THROUGH the modest ranch house into--
S: INT. DINING ROOM
N: WAYNE lectures his boys over venison.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: Some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world, and if it ever darkened their doorstep they wouldn't know how to protect themselves... those are the sheep.
N: Jeff bites back tears. Chris looks troubled.
S: EXT. SCHOOLYARD
N: FROM THE BACK, we watch a BIG BULLY pummel a KID ON THE GROUND. His meaty fists coming down repeatedly as--
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: Then you got predators who use violence to prey on the weak. They're the wolves. 6.
E: VO 03.18.14
N: KID ON THE GROUND is JEFF, his nose bloody. PUSH TOWARD the fight--(ECU) blood flecks fly from the Bully's fist.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: Then there are those blessed with the gift of aggression and an overpowering need to protect the flock.
E: VO
N: A FIST CONNECTS with BIG BULLY's temple. He goes down. Chris stands over the bully, beating the tar out of him.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: These men are the rare breed that live to confront the wolf--
E: VO
S: EXT. FIELD
N: CHRIS stands with his arms extended. Wind blows dirt off his palms and it plumes out across the land.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: They are the sheepdog.
E: VO
S: INT. DINING ROOM
N: WAYNE removes his belt and lays it on the table. CHRIS looks at it, worried.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: Now we're not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf--
C: DEBBY
D: Wayne--
C: WAYNE
D: But we take care of our own. And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it.
C: CHRIS
D: The guy was picking on Jeff.
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: That true?
C: JEFF
D: Yes sir... Yes, he was... 7.
E: eye swollen 03.18.14
C: WAYNE KYLE
D: And did you finish it?
E: turns to Chris
N: Chris shows the swollen knuckles of his hand, and nods.
C: WAYNE
D: Then you know who you are...
S: EXT. BARN
N: A GROWN MAN(CHRIS) exits the barn into the light of day. Behind him, horns of dozens of bucks cover the wall.
C: WAYNE
D: You know your purpose.
E: VO
N: The barn door closes leaving us in brindled darkness. "AMERICAN SNIPER"
S: EXT. RODEO ARENA
N: A hand grips the tie on a bronc. CHRIS sits bareback atop the horse, its nostrils steaming, eyes shock wide. (ECU)-- a hair-line crack along its right front hoof. BUZZER SOUNDS. GATE OPENS. The bronco leaps out. Empty stands blur past. The Bronc and Chris united in a futile struggle. He leans right, the bronc circles right, staying off that bad hoof. Chris makes the buzzer but-- He gets tossed on dismount. The bronco stomps his hand. He scrambles out of the ring as RODEO CLOWNS distract it. FIND JEFF(19) ringside, with tight lips and severe eyes. He looks over the empty arena, laughing.
S: INT. FORD TRUCK
N: Headlights rattle over a dirt road. JEFF drives. CHRIS rides, BAG OF ICE on hand, BELT BUCKLE prize on the dash. He stares into the field where A WILD HORSE, races alongside them, a spectral image in the darkness.
C: JEFF
D: Wasn't nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear. What you supposed to do with it? 8.
E: 03.18.14
C: CHRIS
D: You're supposed to get laid with it. I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood.
E: grabs belt buckle
C: JEFF
D: A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood.
C: CHRIS
D: Is that what they say?
C: JEFF
D: You know what they called her in high school--
C: CHRIS
D: Don't say it.
C: JEFF
D: Sarah suck-a--
N: Chris swings his bag of ice, smacks Jeff in the face.
C: JEFF
D: Shit man--
N: He swerves off the road. The truck almost coming apart before he ramps back up, coming to a dusty halt outside--
S: EXT. BUNKHOUSE
N: Spanish moss hangs over a shackle-board residence. Chris tumbles out the truck, clips on the belt buckle and--
S: INT. BUNKHOUSE
N: CHRIS swaggers into the narrow bunkhouse. A sheet hangs in back, separating sleeping area from living area.
C: CHRIS
D: Who wants to hump a rodeo star?
N: Movement back there. A MAN ASS suddenly protrudes from the curtain as a BURLY COWBOY-TYPE climbs into jeans.
C: CHRIS
D: What the fuck--
N: SARAH steps out, his high school sweetheart all grown up. (03.18.14) 9.
C: SARAH
D: You said you wasn't coming home until tomorrow.
C: CHRIS
D: Why would you do this?
E: wounded
N: Cowboy leaves his shirt open flaunting a big hairy chest.
C: SARAH
D: Just let him out. He didn't know...
C: CHRIS
D: You didn't know?
E: shamed, steps aside
N: Cowboy doesn't answer. Chris SLAMS HIS HEAD into the refrigerator and ramps him out the front door.
C: SARAH
D: What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend!
C: CHRIS
D: Get out.
N: She jumps at the chance-- ripping clothes out of closets.
C: SARAH
D: You think you're a cowboy cause you rodeo? You're no cowboy. You're just a lousy ranch-hand and a shitty fuckin lay!
N: The door slams behind her. Chris stares at the dent in the fridge, wounded. He opens it and pulls out a beer. LATER TV plays across Chris' drunken face. He lays on the sofa, a beer on his chest. JEFF is sprawled in a chair.
C: JEFF
D: Some people ain't worth fighting for.
C: CHRIS
D: But she was right...
C: JEFF
D: A job is a job. At least we're outside. 10.
E: closing his eyes 03.18.14
N: Chris is bleary, lost and drifting to sleep. The images on the TV don't immediately register but-- NEWS FOOTAGE of the WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING (1993) plays on TV. An explosion has demolished the garage.
C: NEWS ANCHOR
D: --group of radical militants called Al- Qaeda are taking credit for a bombing that left six dead and hundreds injured--
E: OS
N: American flags at half mast. His chest rises and falls--
C: CHRIS
D: Jeff, wake up. Look at this--
N: The faces of INNOCENT VICTIMS play across the screen. Chris' injured hand slowly curls into a fist.
C: CHRIS
D: Look what they did...
S: INT. NAVY RECRUITING OFFICE
N: Posters of destroyers on walls. The NAVY RECRUITER is lean and shrewd.
C: CHRIS
D: I saw what they did, on our soil, and--
C: NAVY RECRUITER
D: And you're from Texas and you're a patriot so it pissed you off.
C: CHRIS
D: Yes, sir. But I can't see myself on a ship. I'd wanna be in the fight--
C: NAVY RECRUITER
D: You wanna fight? Meet the warrior elite.
N: He slides him a brochure-- "NAVY SEALS" emerge from the water, armed and bound for glory.
C: CHRIS KYLE

C: CHRIS
D: I ain't much of a swimmer-- 11.

S: EXT. NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE CENTER / "THE GRINDER" - DAY
N: CHRIS and 50 OTHER CANDIDATES lay on their backs doing flutter-kicks on a patch of blacktop surrounded by beige buildings. INSTRUCTORS wield hoses.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: You a quitter, boy?
E: sprays Chris in the face
C: CHRIS KYLE
D: No, sir!
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: Bullshit, you are fleet-meat. Don't turn away. Look up and take it. You're old as fuck. Did you join the Navy cause you had such a good time on Noah's Arc? How old are you?
C: CHRIS
D: 30, sir.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: 30! You fart dust and could've fathered half these boys. You think cause you had a pop-gun back in Texas you're cut out to be a SEAL?
C: CHRIS
D: No, sir.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: No, you're not cut out to be one?
N: Chris is twisted in agony and clearly dislikes the water. (03.18.14) 12.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: What kind of asshole joins the Navy but hates the water.
C: CHRIS
D: I love water, hooyah.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: My ass you do.
N: A CANDIDATE chokes a giggle. Rolle wheels around on-- RYAN JOB(24), a goofy, overweight Oregon kid who looks like he should be taking orders at a drive-thru window.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: Is that you giggling you fat fuck? Look at you. You're so fat they had to baptize you at Sea World. Your momma fat too?
C: RYAN
D: No sir, she's not.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: Don't lie to me! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute. What the fuck are you doing here fatboy? Do your feet get wet when you shower? When's the last time you saw your pecker? You're not a Seal, you're a fuckin Walrus. A big giggling Walrus. "Biggles" that's your new name--
N: "BIGGLES" is choking, coughing, struggling. ROLLE points to A BRASS BELL mounted on the back of a truck.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: --and that's your ticket home. Just drag your jelly-roll ass up and ring it and you'll be headed home to momma Shamu.
N: BIGGLES is beaten, legs giving out, ready to quit when--
C: CHRIS
D: Two hundred.
E: OC draws Rolle off Biggles
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: Did I ask you to count?
E: whirls around, hosing
C: CHRIS
D: No, sir. 13.
E: 03.18.14
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: Was that your ass talking then?
N: THE BELL RINGS. Chris jerks up, worried it was Biggles but-- an ATHLETIC CANDIDATE staggers off.
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: That's a quitter. If he quits here, he'll quit in battle. When shit gets hairy he can't step up. You get shot, he can't pull you out. We're gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two.
N: Chris and Biggles share a look, a vow, as--
C: INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
D: Wave goodbye to the sun, boys...
S: EXT. BEACH - "SNAKE PIT" - NIGHT
N: A bonfire crackles atop a sand dune. CANDIDATES crouch in a pit they dug, hugging oars, shivering with hypothermia. CHRIS stands over the ditch, trying to make INSTRUCTORS laugh to earn a place by the fire beside BIGGLES.
C: CHRIS
D: --and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, "it stings, it stings" but when I'd stop, she'd scream "no don't stop" and it's fizzing out and--
E: guys start laughing
N: INSTRUCTORS in stitches. Fire flickering off Chris' face.
S: EXT. "MUD FLATS" - DAY

D: You really from Connecticut, Dauber? I never met a hick from Hartford.
N: "DAUBER" is 6'4" and 240 with a flop of yellow hair like the character from Coach. A sleepy Connecticut cowboy.
C: DAUBER
D: Country is countrywide, sir.
C: INSTRUCTOR "TONY"
D: I don't think he likes black dudes, "D".
N: "D" is African American, from Indiana, stoic and stacked. He has a rhythmic grumble and a meat-eater's glare.
C: "D"
D: That's alright, sir. I'm not black.
C: INSTRUCTOR "TONY"
D: No?
C: "D"
D: No, I'm new black. We run slow, jump low, swim good and shop at Gap. We make white folk proud then hose their ladies.
N: "BIGGLES" still giggles, but he's looking fit as they chip away everything that isn't a Navy Seal.
C: INSTRUCTOR "TONY"
D: You hungry Biggles? I'd bet you'd eat the ass out of a low-flying duck.
C: BIGGLES
D: Hooyah. I'd toss that critter shitter on a baguette and get my eat on.
N: "SQUIRREL" is a San Clemente surfer kid, just tall enough to ride roller-coaster, with a jutty jaw.
C: INSTRUCTOR "TONY"
D: Squirrel! Where'd you hide your nuts?
E: screams in his face
C: SQUIRREL
D: Nuts crawled up inside. The little shits are gone for good.

S: INT. MULONEY'S BAR - NIGHT
N: A crowd watches the boys toss darts at a bulls-eye drawn on DAUBER'S naked back. At the bar, BIGGLES and CHRIS--
C: CHRIS
D: I'm gonna try and get into sniper school.
C: BIGGLES
D: Can you shoot?
C: CHRIS
D: I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper?
C: BIGGLES
D: Blowing shit up. Blowing shit up is way cooler.
N: A brunette steps to the bar. A sharp object with heavy eye-shadow and tight leather pants. This girl owns her sexuality but she's often been used for it. This is "TAYA". She is trying to ignore the advances of A SHORT NAVY GUY but he's relentless. Chris watches as (ECU)-- Taya's fingertips whiten, gripping her glass. Chris edges closer, she looks up, defensive-- but he just stands there, letting his protective presence be felt.
C: DAPPER NAVY GUY
D: Come on, just let me buy you a drink. 16.
E: OC 03.18.14

E: end of her rope
C: DAPPER NAVY GUY
D: I'm not--
C: TAYA
D: I watched you take your ring off. Don't be a scumbag. Go home.
N: Navy Guy retreats. Taya sips her scotch, doesn't look up.
C: CHRIS
D: It could be the leather pants.
C: TAYA
D: Yeah? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone?
C: CHRIS
D: Corduroy.
N: She takes him in. Loose sweatshirt, no hair gel.
C: TAYA
D: Is that how it is with you guys-- suddenly single after three beers?
C: CHRIS
D: Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth.
C: TAYA
D: That's great. A real red-neck.
C: CHRIS
D: I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan.
C: TAYA
D: What's the difference?
C: CHRIS
D: We ride horses, they ride their cousins.
C: TAYA
D: What do you do for work? You look like military. 17.
E: almost laughs 03.18.14
C: CHRIS
D: I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates.
C: TAYA
D: Do I look stupid to you?
C: CHRIS
D: To be honest, you look a little sad.
N: She's taken aback by his observation.
C: CHRIS
D: So am I tall enough to buy you a drink?
C: TAYA
D: Not until you tell me what you do.
C: CHRIS
D: How about this: one shot, one answer.
N: Chris passes her a shot. She throws it back, fierce.
C: TAYA
D: You're obviously military. What branch?
C: CHRIS
D: I'm just finishing BUD/S.
C: TAYA
D: Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?
C: CHRIS
D: That was two questions...
C: TAYA
D: I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL.
E: two angry shots
C: CHRIS
D: What's that mean you know all about us?
C: TAYA
D: You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. I'd never date a SEAL. 18.
E: pushes him a shot 03.18.14
C: CHRIS
D: How can you say we're self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country.
E: confused
C: TAYA
D: Why?
C: CHRIS
D: Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you.
E: climbs off stool
C: TAYA
D: Where are you going?
C: CHRIS
D: You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home.
C: TAYA
D: I said I'd never marry one.
N: It's a lie and they both know it.
C: CHRIS
D: Well in that case... what's your name?
C: TAYA
D: Taya.
C: CHRIS
D: Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle.
C: TAYA
D: Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, isn't it Chris?
E: liquor softening her
C: CHRIS
D: Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women.
C: TAYA
D: Sounds like you're under attack.
N: She levels a look and downs another shot-- (03.18.14) 19.
S: EXT. MULRONEY'S BAR, PARKING LOT - LATER
N: Mist rolls in. Chris holds Taya's hair as she pukes. She takes a deep breath, wipes her mouth--

N: She smiles, then turns to puke again--
S: EXT. RANGE - "SNIPER SCHOOL" - CAMP BILLY MACHEN - DAY
N: An arid range with human-shaped targets. PETTY OFFICER TOSH (Irish/Japanese, nasty) walks past prone students.
C: PO TOSH
D: Feel breath filling every cell of your body. This is our ritual. We master our breath, we master our mind---
N: FIND CHRIS on .300 Win-Mag. Both eyes open. Dip packed. Deep breaths. His finger taking up the trigger-slack.
C: PO TOSH
D: --pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort. You will be aware of it but not directing it. And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause and the space between heart-beats.
N: Chris exhales, pauses, strokes-- BAM!
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE
N: A ZOLOFT BROCHURE shows smiling faces. TAYA wears a suit- skirt and tries to mimic the esprit of the brochure. She leaves a box of samples with the RECEPTIONIST but her smile fades as she pulls her trolley to the door--
S: INT. TAYA'S CONDO - DAY
N: Blades of light leak through closed blinds. Taya hides under blankets on the sofa. PHONE RINGS, goes to message:
C: CHRIS
D: It's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on? I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. Or the one before that. So, I figured-- 20.
E: OS 03.18.14

D: You figured what?
N: --looking for a reason not to be alone.
S: EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN - DAY
N: ON CHRIS, both eyes open looking downrange.
C: PO TOSH
D: Aim small, miss small. If you aim for his shirt button, you might miss by two inches. If you aim for his shirt, you miss by two feet. You better close those groupings, Kyle.
E: OC over Chris, raises binocs
N: Chris chases his breath, trying to focus, but--
S: EXT. OCEANSIDE PIER - DUSK
N: PAN ACROSS a "target shoot" game to a bench overlooking surf. CHRIS and TAYA sit with a GIANT TEDDY BEAR.

D: I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more.
C: TAYA
D: So you started rescuing girls from bars?
C: CHRIS
D: I rescued that bar from you.
N: She smiles at his sweetness.
C: CHRIS
D: Do you like country music?
C: TAYA
D: Only when I'm depressed.
C: CHRIS
D: You want kids? 21.
E: 03.18.14
C: TAYA
D: Someday. My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men.
C: CHRIS
D: That's a shitty thing to tell a girl.
C: TAYA
D: I've proven her right.
C: CHRIS
D: But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you are.
N: The Ferris wheel casts its glow on them.
C: TAYA
D: What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun?
C: CHRIS
D: I don't know... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes.
E: uncertain
N: It weighs on him. And she feels safe. BACK TO:
S: 35A EXT. RANGE - CAMP BILLY MACHEN 35A
N: PO TOSH (on spotting scope) stands over CHRIS. Mirage boils off the horizon at 35 degree angle, pushed by wind. BAM! Chris' shot hits the outer edge of target.
C: PO TOSH
D: Mirage is boiling at 35 degree angle.
C: CHRIS
D: Check. I'm dialed for windage.
C: PO TOSH
D: Hold right-four, up-two.

D: You're trembling...
C: TAYA
D: I know. I don't...
N: She finds his eyes. Finds her breath.
C: CHRIS
D: We don't have to do this...
C: TAYA
D: I want to. I do...
N: He gently lifts her up and lays her across the couch. ANOTHER ANGLE Soft light on pale bodies. Taya writhes with impatient longing but Chris' steady hand forces her into the present. She's swept up, eyes filling with tears as he eases into her-- she gasps and arcs and draws him deeper.

C: PO TOSH
D: There is nothing out there but a target.
E: OC
C: CHRIS
D: Negative. There's something--
N: CHRIS POV (BOTH EYES VIEW) The circular scope floats over the target. Left of scope, a SWATCH OF GRASS doesn't sway like the rest. (03.18.14) 23.
C: PO TOSH
D: Give me 50 push-ups. Clear and safe. Push `em out.
N: The scope drifts left of target-- BAM! A RATTLESNAKE is flung through the air, blown to shit, 500 yards out.
C: CHRIS
D: There it is.
N: He sets the rifle aside and starts cranking out push-ups.
S: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Ethereal white sheets. Two bodies lay like spoons. Chris WHISPERS SOMETHING. Taya closes her eyes. A beat--

N: She stares at the wall.

C: TAYA
D: Oh my god! No! Chris--
E: OS
N: Chris bounds up, running into the next room. Taya stands in front of the television. They both watch as-- ON TV NEWS: THE SECOND PLANE hits the World Trade Center. It steals their breath. Chris hugs her close, trying to shield her from it. His shock bleeds to rage. 40A OMITTED 40A
S: INT. DANCE FLOOR, RENT-A-YATCH - LATER
N: The storm closing in. CHRIS two-steps TAYA around the dance floor to Van Morrison's romantic "Someone Like You." Chris looks boyish and dapper and Taya is flush with beauty and promise. The moment is quietly sincere with the entire WEDDING PARTY watching when--

D: What the hell is on your neck?
E: her hand smudged with paint
N: She pulls at his collar to reveal GREEN SPRAY-PAINT upside his neck.
C: CHRIS

C: CHRIS
D: Package deal babe.
E: smiles
N: He dances her away from them and pulls his jacket aside, flashing his boys the Trident pinned to his chest. AT THE BAR TONY bowls up; once their instructor, now their Chief.

C: TONY
D: It's on boys. Just got the call.
E: looks them over

C: TAYA
D: I'm so afraid.

N: The rig hits a pothole and faces clench expecting an IED.

S: EXT. ROOFTOP/ SNIPER NEST - DAY
N: Under a corrugated piece of steel, a ritual unfolds-- Chris packs a dip. He lays out his Bible and flag. Loads bullets in a wrist-sheath. Starts to marshal his breath. Time slows as he lowers his eye to the glass. (NOTE: we are back to the beginning of the film.) CHRIS SCOPE POV TRACK ACROSS bombed-out buildings, twisted metal and golden-domed mosques. Ragged curtains flutter out a window. Cat-tails on the river sway the same direction. SFX: A LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ escalates over picture as his concentration deepens.

IN THE STREET YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt. CLOSE ON CHRIS His eyes water with focus, his exhale hisses from tobacco- stained teeth. Breathe it down. He struggles to get calm. SFX: THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-- CROSS-HAIRS left of the running target, leading him, compensating for a dozen different considerations as-- He pauses upon exhale. The world goes quiet. Landscape pulses with color and focus. He stokes the trigger and-- THE BULLET Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip.

Protect the Marines. Protect... Clouds crawl over Chris like ghosts, swirling feverishly as HOURS SLIDE BY. His face takes on a preternatural blankness as he begins to slip into the shadows of self. Suddenly-- clouds halt, pupils flare, chest inflates.
S: EXT. ELIZABETH STREET - SAME
N: Sun flares as MARC LEE advances alongside 1ST PLATOON MARINES (40 men) when-- A SHOT SOUNDS. A BODY TUMBLES out of the sky and lands in their midst with a meaty thud. 1ST MARINE #1 -Fuck, man! What the hell-- The Marines duck for cover then look to the sky-- 1ST MARINE #2 -Where'd it come from?
C: MARC LEE
D: That's your overwatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. Keep moving.
N: Marines slowly return to standing, glancing up at surrounding structures trying to spot their protector.
S: INT. WINDOW - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Chris lays atop a baby crib. A scrim hangs in front of him. Sunlight burns through it, casting a thousand pinpricks of light across his face. SUN MARCHES ACROSS the sky and pixels twist over his cataleptic shape. (03.18.14) 32. Suddenly-- sun halts, chest inflates, eyes flare.
S: INT. STREET - SAME
N: A CAR SPEEDS toward 1ST PLATOON. MARINES open fire with the feeble POP-POP of M4s. The car still coming-- A SNIPER SHOT BOOMS across the sky like thunder. The windshield spiders, blood splattered, and the car stops. As Marines search rooftops for him-- THE CAR EXPLODES.
S: INT. LOOTED ROOM, ELIZABETH STREET - EVENING

N: Viper Marines drag the soldier out. In the phosphorous green glow, we watch his body tremor as he dies. SFX: CHRIS' ELEVATED HEARTBEAT pounds over scene as-- WASHROOM MUSTAFA flees down the hall. A fluttering shadow in darkness, except for the reflective swoosh on his Nikes. LOOTED ROOM Chris lays on the gun, brow pinched with onus, silence like a scream. This happened on my watch. CHRIS SCOPE POV (N/V) CROSS-HAIRS TRACK across the city-scape. TIME LAPSES and the world (in scope) SPEEDS UP. Humvees and tanks streak past, lights blur, trees blow in choppy havoc, then-- TIME SLOWS to a crawl as CROSS-HAIRS FIND A MALE hurrying into a alley, pulling shit from a pack. We zero-in and-- a flame flickers. The male is smoking opium. (03.18.14) 34. CROSS-HAIRS drift off him and TIME SPEEDS UP, dogs eat a rotting body by the roadside, vicious in fast motion. TWO WOMEN wobble down the road with buckets, wind whips roadside grass into a tizzy and WE HALT ON-- CROSS-HAIRS ON A PERFECT CIRCLE in the grass, a rifle- barrel? Stay on it. In stillness it finds context; a RUSTY PIPE. TIME SPEEDS FORWARD, TWO BOYS zip by on a Vespa, OLD MEN frantically bow to mecca on rooftops. Clouds boil across dawn sky. His eye never leaves glass.

N: The Blackhawk lifts off, ZOOMING across the desert floor.
C: COL. JONES

C: CHRIS
D: He still inside?

D: I'm only clocking one point of entry. He's in there, but it's no easy breach.
C: BIGGLES
D: When they see it's The Legend they'll probably just invite him in-- 69.
E: 03.18.14
C: CHRIS
D: You got a problem? I didn't promote myself.
C: BIGGLES
D: No, I did it for you. You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth".
N: Chris snaps Biggles down, wrestles him into a choke.
C: "D"
D: Myth becomes Legend when we occupy a house, get 23 kills, and 21 are his.
C: TONY

E: translates
N: Chris nods dubious gratitude, meeting the Father's eyes.
C: CHRIS
D: Tell him that's very generous of him.
N: DINING ROOM - LATER A braised head of lamb eaten clean. TEAM 3 are chowing down, in good spirits, as Chris watches THE FATHER teach his SON to read. He is moved by their connection and acutely aware of what this war is costing him. That's when he sees-- (ECU) "SHOOTERS STRAWBERRIES" on father's elbows. They're red and calloused, like his own. Chris darkens, stands and slips down the hall-- BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER (03.18.14) 70. CHRIS searches the closet, ripping through clothes, pressing wall panels. He's crossing to the bed when-- FLOORBOARDS CREAK beneath the rug underfoot. He stands there, shifting his weight, floor creaking. DINING ROOM/HALLWAY BIGGLES is shoveling food in his mouth when a hand stops him. Chris signals, no more. FATHER'S eyes flick up as-- CHRIS RIPS THE FATHER out of his chair, dragging him down the hall by his hair. WIFE and KIDS screaming. "D" holds them off as-- Chris dumps the father at a STASH HOLE in the floor. Inside, a CACHE OF AKs, RPGs, IED components.
C: CHRIS
D: Tell him he's gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him-- or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there.
C: MARC LEE
D: That's a bad move--
C: BIGGLES
D: He's our breech. He's a fucking way in--

S: NEXT INTERSECTION
N: As Chris arrives, the GETAWAY TRUCK roars past a block to the north. He continues at a dead-sprint but-- At next intersection, he's lost more ground. He halts, sucking wind, GALLIC CROSS TATTOO visible on his forearm. ABOVE (LOOKING OUT) A YOUNG SHADOW stands in the window, watching the soldier below. She picks up an old Nokia Cellular, dialing--

N: DISTANT ALLEY A flutter of robes. A rusty gate pushed open by an OLD MAN. Mustafa slips past, brushing the man's shoulder in thanks. Breath in cadence with step, his head turns up-- Smoke plumes into night, their signal leading him ahead. CHRIS/TRIBAL LEADER Terp translates, Tribal Leader responds violently--

S: EXT. HUMVEE (PULLING AWAY)
N: THE ROUND HITS the shield. BIGGLES fires at the rooftop. Bullets strafing night as the Humvee door closes and they roar off. A PUNISHER SKULL drawn in grease on his shield, gleams in the moonlight. Mustafa's shot struck the Punisher in the eye. PUSH ON the teeth of the logo and--

N: He leads "D", RANGER ONE and FOUR OTHERS across the roof. They stumble past INSURGENTS, blinded by sand. STREET BELOW CHRIS and SQUAD stagger into HOWLING CHAOS, clinging to each other, trailing Chris as GUNFIRE POPS behind them.
C: CHRIS
D: Stryker-3, what's your location--
E: choking, into mike
N: AN INSURGENT is blown right into them. "D" wrestles his gun away and beats him with it.
C: CHRIS
D: Hold there! We are 30 seconds out-- Go. Straight ahead. Go--
E: pointing ahead
N: They run for their lives. Unable to see two feet ahead. Sand shredding their skin. Chris is struggling-- Squad passing him. Knees failing him. He can't keep up.
S: INT. STRYKER
N: THE GUNNER stares at REMOTE WEAPONS SCREEN when SIX FIGURES EMERGE from the dust. He's about to fire--
C: GUNNER
D: BDUs-- That's them! Drop the ramp.
N: The ramp drops. STORM HOWLING. RANGER-ONE dives in, MARINES follow, then "D" rolls in. The rig pulls off. (03.18.14) 108.
C: "D"
D: Where's Chris? He was just--
N: IN THE STREET Chris falters forward. Insurgents pursuing. The Stryker just visible ahead-- pulling away. IN THE STRYKER M2 GUNNER can't see shit on his monitor.
C: "D"
D: --stop the rig, man! Stop--
C: DRIVER
D: I don't see him--
N: IN THE STREET Chris is ten feet behind the rig, sprinting. Bullets sing past. He sheds flack-jacket and webbing, Bible and flag. He drops his gun in the dirt and dives. His hand clutches the last rung of slat-armor and-- Chris Kyle is dragged off the battlefield. IN THE STREET Sand buries the METALLIC TOY SOLDIER that followed him since childhood. Wind whips pages of the Bible and pulls at the flag until it flaps unfolded. WE'RE BLOWN AWAY with it, twisting and clapping into an otherworldy beige. IN THE STORM We catch glimpses of the city below: graffiti'd T-walls, a cracked expanse of desert floor and the lanky body of an enemy sniper splayed across a rooftop. Wind rips the Hefty bag away and sand pocks the DEAD FACE OF MUSTAFA-- before we're swept up into the howling rage.
T: LONG FADE:
N: (03.18.14) 109.
S: 140A INT. AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT 140A

C: CHRIS
D: Okay.
S: 141A INT. KYLE HOME 141A
N: CLOSE ON- the back of Chris' head. He watches a WAR MOVIE on TV. As CAMERA CIRCLES the room, we glimpse THE MOVIE; an injured soldier calls for help amid shocking gunfire. TRACKING BEHIND THE TV, we see Chris' wrought face and a household bustling around him. COLTON carries party plates outside, MCKENNA fights to get cowboy boots on and- TAYA CALLS to him from the kitchen but we can't hear her until the CAMERA TRACKS to HER POV-- the gunfire is gone, the TV IS OFF. That war movie is playing in his head.
C: TAYA
D: Chris...?
N: He finally looks up, slick with sweat, affecting calm.
S: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
N: Streamers twist against gunmetal sky. COLTON and MCKENNA set up birthday decorations. The family dog, A PYRENEES SHEEPDOG, bounds about. TAYA AND CHRIS, on back steps.
C: TAYA
D: --his game is Saturdays. He's the tallest kid on the team. The doctor said he could be six-four. I can't wait for you to see him play. Maybe you could even coach?
N: Chris looks past his kids, looking a thousand yards out.
C: TAYA
D: McKenna's about to lose that tooth and I'm worried she's going to swallow it. She said she'd let you pull it. But only you.
N: His head falls. When he looks up-- COLTON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY UNDERWAY 6 YEAR OLDS and PARENTS mill around but all WE HEAR-- (03.18.14) 111.
C: TAYA
D: I wish you'd talk to me, Chris.
E: VO CONT'D
N: COLTON AND TWO FRIENDS chase each other around the yard.
C: TAYA
D: I just feel this dark space between us and I don't know how to reach you.
E: VO CONT'D
N: THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON'S FRIEND. The boy goes down hard, gets up crying, running from the dog. The Sheepdog does it again. THE BOY FALLS AND HIS CRYING is cuts into scene. THE BOY'S MOM runs over. His back clawed up.
C: BOY'S MOM
D: Get him off! Get away--
N: Chris rips the dog off by its collar. The dog snaps at him and in an instant he whips out his .45 to shoot it.
C: TAYA
D: No! He's a puppy. He doesn't know!
E: OC
N: Chris looks up, bent with animus, and he's looking at the face of his children, their friends, and their parents-- They look at him, terrified. He releases the dog. Lost.
S: INT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Harsh light. Water-stained walls. CHRIS looks beaten, afraid and dubious of this BUTTONED-DOWN DOCTOR. (03.18.14) 112.
C: DOCTOR
D: Maybe you saw things, or did some things over there that you wish you hadn't--
C: CHRIS
D: That's not me.
C: DOCTOR
D: What's not you?
C: CHRIS
D: I was just protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took. The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn't save.
E: struggles
C: NAVY DOCTOR
D: You want to save more guys, walk down any hall in this hospital. We got plenty soldiers that need saving. I'm going to recommend Zoloft and--
E: pulls prescription pad
S: EXT./INT. REC ROOM
N: CHRIS steps to a window looking in on TEN YOUNG VETERANS sitting around a TV; wounded, edgy, in need. A legless Marine with a jelly-roll face looks up; this is "WYNN".
S: EXT. SHOOTING RANGE, UNIDENTIFIABLE LOCALE - DAY
N: CHRIS kneels before WYNN (wheelchair) who's armed with a .300 resting on Chris' shoulder. Wynn takes aim, FIRES--
C: CHRIS
D: How's it feel?
C: WYNN
D: Feels like The Legend is trying to fuck up my shot. Stay still, man.
N: Gun on shoulder, Chris is calm, he's found peace. BAM!
C: WYNN
D: Bulls-eye, boy! Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back. 113.
E: 03.18.14
N: Chris dusts himself off. There's healing here.
C: WYNN
D: Why you spend all this time with us? I know you got a family.
C: CHRIS
D: I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and--
C: WYNN
D: Seriously man. Why do you do it.
E: laughs
C: CHRIS
D: We gotta take care of our own.
N: Chris squints into the falling sun and time passes with--
T: LONG FADE:

N: The black F350 roars past a "Welcome to Texas" sign on the interstate.
S: EXT. KYLE HOME - MIDLOTHIAN, TEXAS - DAY
N: A residential neighborhood. Texas flags wave from stoops. CHRIS and COLTON carry boxes inside. "MAX THE SHEEPDOG" bounds along with them and never leaves Chris' side. BEDROOM Chris enters to find Taya has placed his old COWBOY BOOTS at the foot of the bed. He takes a seat and looks down at the combat boots on his feet. He bends to unlace them--
S: 153A EXT. PASTURE, TEXAS - DAY 153A
N: A pale Stallion gallops through prairie grass. Chris and McKenna admire it from a rustic fence. Her pink cowboys boots kick Texas dust onto his old boots. (03.18.14) 114.
S: 153B INT. BATHROOM, KYLE HOME - DAY 153B
N: Chris is showering when Taya sneaks in and flushes the toilet. He howls at the scalding water and she's laughing, rushing for the door when-- he lunges out and grabs her, pulling her in with all her clothes on.
S: EXT. FIELD - DAWN
N: Under a watercolor dawn, CHRIS leads COLTON across a prairie, hunting rifle on shoulder, teaching as they go. THE SCORE BUILDS and follows them into morning.
S: INT. KYLE HOUSE - DAY
N: Dust motes drift across blades of light falling through blinds onto CHRIS. He wears the BELT BUCKLE he won long ago, pleated Levis, and twirls an antique six-shooter.
C: CHRIS
D: Get `em up, lil' lady. Hands in the air.
N: TAYA is at the window gazing at their kids in the yard.
C: TAYA
D: Can I tell you something.
C: CHRIS
D: Tell it to the judge.
C: TAYA
D: I'm proud of you and I don't say it enough. I feel blessed. You're an incredible father and-- I feel lucky to have my husband back.
C: CHRIS
D: We could lock the doors. They can't get out of the yard.
C: TAYA
D: I know how hard you fought to get here. 115.
E: 03.18.14

D: You're worth fighting for.
N: She crosses to him, running a hand up his leg.
C: TAYA
D: Did you pleat those jeans?
C: CHRIS
D: Yes, ma'am. Right up the middle.
C: TAYA
D: Well, you're just a regular old cowboy again, aren't you?
N: He kisses her, lifting her--
C: CHRIS
D: I meant what I said about locking the doors.
C: TAYA
D: Aren't you and Chad going to the range?
C: CHRIS
D: Not for four minutes.
E: checks watch
C: TAYA
D: Is that all it takes.
C: CHRIS
D: It'll take half that. Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you.
N: He sways with her, dancing a little two-step.
C: TAYA
D: Who are you taking out?
C: CHRIS
D: This Marine. His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help.
C: TAYA

C: COLTON
D: No way.
C: MCKENNA
D: Poke the bear--
N: McKENNA pokes Chris and he BARKS like a dog.
C: MCKENNA
D: No. You're supposed to roar. Like Grrr.
N: She pokes him again and Chris emits a RUMBLING ROAR. She giggles and hugs him so he'll save her.
C: CHRIS
D: I should get going...
N: He kisses his daughter and tosses his son's hair.
C: CHRIS
D: Look after our women, Bubba. Love you, babe.
E: turns to Taya
C: TAYA
D: Love you too.
N: Chris kisses Taya and lingers, worshiping her. Dust motes drift past and he appears immortal in the bladed light. Then-- He walks out the door for the last time. The house grows quiet. Colton plays video games. McKenna colors. The dog lays by the door. And Taya stands in the golden light.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
