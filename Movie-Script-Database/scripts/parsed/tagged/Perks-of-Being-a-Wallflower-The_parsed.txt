M: Written by
M: Stephen Chbosky
M: Final Draft
T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: The titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings, announcing the end of a line, and we see our title... THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city. Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a child in the back of a station wagon. We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then we enter... The Tunnel. We keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden, alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway. We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a window, and into...
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: It is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books. CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box.
C: CHARLIE
D: Dear Friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I don't want you to do that. I just need to know that people like you exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you nervous.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban split level house.
C: CHARLIE
D: I hope it's okay for me to think that. You see, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine. Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil.
C: CHARLIE
D: But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever, and I really need to turn things around this year. So, I have a plan.
E: V.O. hopeful
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LAST DAY
N: We see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in the air like a New York confetti parade.
C: CHARLIE
D: As I enter the school for the first time, I will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie walks down the hall. Triumphant. Confident. Happy.
C: CHARLIE
D: Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FIRST DAY
N: Reality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making dozens of freshmen hop down the hall.
C: SENIOR BULLY
D: Hop, freshman toads. Hop! Move it, boys!
N: As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.
C: CHARLIE
D: ... 1,385 days from now.
E: V.O.
N: VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets.
C: LINEBACKER
D: Man, you got big.
C: NOSE TACKLE
D: Worked out all summer. Rock hard, dude.
N: At the front of the pack is BRAD HAYS (17), the quarterback. He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly. The big man on campus. Nice guy, too.
C: BRAD HAYS
D: Would you guys get a room?
N: They laugh. Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them. Trying to make himself as small as possible.
C: CHARLIE
D: Just 1,385 days.
E: V.O. trying to be optimistic
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister. CANDACE KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss.
C: CHARLIE
D: In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek would have let me eat lunch with their earth club.
E: V.O.
C: CANDACE
D: Seniors only. What are you doing with a plastic spork?
E: barks to Derek
N: Candace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17. Derek is such a pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail.
C: DEREK
D: I don't want to bring back silverware--
C: CANDACE
D: Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
N: Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog. Charlie watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LATER
N: Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a great time with their friends. He sees a pretty girl with blonde hair having the best first day. This is SUSAN, 14.
C: CHARLIE
D: When my sister said no, I thought maybe my old friend Susan would want to have lunch with me.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away.
C: CHARLIE
D: In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around, but now she doesn't like to say hi to me anymore.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays.
C: CHARLIE
D: And then there's Brad Hays, who's the quarterback of our team. Before my brother went to play football for Penn State, he and Brad played together. So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am I kidding?
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Brad catches Charlie staring at him. Awkward.
S: INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY
N: Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.
C: CHARLIE
D: On the bright side, one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's legendary goatee with a grease pencil.
E: V.O.
N: Meet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over high school. He is the class clown, performing a perfect imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan.
C: PATRICK
D: Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I learned that in 'Nam back in '68. "Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks."
N: The laughter suddenly dies as the real MR. CALLAHAN (57) walks up behind the oblivious Patrick.
C: PATRICK
D: But you know what happened? That prick punch killed my best friend in a Saigon whorehouse.
E: CONT'D
N: Patrick suddenly feels Mr. Callahan behind him. Oops.
C: MR. CALLAHAN
D: I heard you were going to be in my class. Are you proud being a senior taking freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?
C: PATRICK
D: My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick or you call me nothing.
C: MR. CALLAHAN
D: Okay... Nothing.
N: The class laughs. Except Charlie. He watches Patrick take the long walk back to his seat.
C: CHARLIE
D: I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything. He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better.
E: V.O.
C: MR. CALLAHAN
D: Everyone open your safety guides. Nothing... why don't you read first?
N: Patrick opens the book.
C: PATRICK
D: Chapter 1. Surviving your fascist shop teacher, who needs to put kids down to feel big. Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should read on.
E: to the class
N: Charlie smiles. He loves him already.
S: INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING
N: The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird. Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the plastic pouch, and writes... "ENGLISH CLASS... DAY ONE."
C: CHARLIE
D: My last class of the day is advanced English, and I'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school...
E: V.O.
N: A SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him.
C: SMART ASS FRESHMAN
D: Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.
E: whispers
N: The kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist.
C: BILL
D: Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English. This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz?
N: All hands go up. Except Charlie's. Bill paces the rows.
C: BILL
D: I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book. Anyone?
E: CONT'D
N: As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.
C: BILL
D: He's British. He also invented the serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence, the term cliffhanger. Anybody?
E: CONT'D
C: FRESHMAN GIRL
D: Shakespeare.
C: BILL
D: That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else? The author was...
E: off their silence
N: Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has already written... Charles Dickens.
C: BILL
D: ... Charles Dickens. However, if you and I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can you imagine that? We would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office. And that's where we get the term... anyone?
E: CONT'D
C: KIDS
D: "Office Depot!" "Office Supplies!"
E: O.S.
N: Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that Bill is staring at him. Waiting for him to raise his hand.
C: BILL
D: I'll give you a free "A" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right.
N: Charlie looks down. He's not going to answer.
C: BILL
D: Box office.
E: CONT'D
N: The kids groan. They should have known. Charlie smiles to himself. He's going to like this class.
S: INT. ENGLISH CLASS - LATER
N: The bell rings. The students chatter their way out of class. The last to leave is Charlie.
C: BILL
D: You should learn to participate.
N: Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board.
C: BILL
D: Why didn't you raise your hand? They call you teacher's pet? Freak? I used to get spaz. I mean, come on, spaz?
E: CONT'D off Charlie's shrug off Charlie's nod
N: Charlie smiles. Bill takes a moment. Then...
C: BILL
D: So, I heard you had a tough time last year. But they say if you make one friend on your first day, you're doing okay.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing.
C: BILL
D: Yeah. I could see that.
C: CHARLIE
D: Don't worry, Mr. Anderson. I'm okay.
N: Bill nods and watches Charlie exit. He gets swallowed up by the hallway as the bell rings.
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Charlie looks through the thick office glass. He sees Patrick use his charms on MRS. SMALL, (58) the Principal.
C: PATRICK
D: I would happily not take shop...
E: to Mrs. Small
N: Out of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book.
C: SENIOR BULLY
D: Hey, Freshman Toad.
N: The bully rips the cover. He throws it on the ground as his friends laugh and disappear down the hall. Charlie walks up and picks up his book.
C: CHARLIE
D: Well, I have 1,384 days to go. And just so I say it to someone, high school is even worse than middle school.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Charlie walks up the path to his house.
C: CHARLIE
D: If my parents ask me about it, I probably won't tell them the truth because I don't want them to worry that I might get bad again.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: Charlie tapes his book cover back together. He looks up as his dad comes home from a long day. Charlie's mom hugs him.
C: CHARLIE
D: If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could talk to her. And I know she would understand how I am both happy and sad, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be. I just hope I make a friend soon. Love always, Charlie.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
N: Charlie stands in the kitchen, pouring his milk.
C: MOTHER
D: Charlie, come on.
E: O.S.
N: His family is seated around the table. Candace's boyfriend, Derek, is their special guest.
C: DEREK
D: Mmmm. This chicken paprikash is delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
N: Charlie's father rolls his eyes, then reads his sports page.
C: MOTHER
D: Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's favorite. He was a little nervous about starting high school, so I made it.
C: FATHER
D: You feel a little silly being nervous now, huh, champ?
C: CHARLIE
D: Yes, sir. I sure do.
N: Charlie carries his milk back to the table. He quickly sits, hoping someone will change the subject.
C: FATHER
D: I told you. Just give 'em a smile and be yourself. That's how you--
C: CANDACE
D: "--make friends in the real world."
C: FATHER
D: You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
C: DEREK
D: Freshman year is tough, but you really find yourself.
C: FATHER
D: Thanks, Derek.
E: deep eye roll
S: INT. LIVING ROOM / ENTRY HALL - EVENING
N: Charlie's father and mother watch a local sports show. Charlie passes by them with ice cream on his way downstairs.
C: MOTHER
D: I think you could be a little nicer to Derek.
C: FATHER
D: I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy. I can't stand him.
N: Charlie moves to the entry hall. He looks through the screen door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye. As Derek walks to his mom's Mercedes, Candace joins Charlie.
C: DEREK
D: I hope you love the mix I made. The cover is hand-painted.
E: waving from car
N: When he gets into his car, she hands Charlie the mix tape.
C: CANDACE
D: Charlie, do you want this?
C: CHARLIE
D: Are you sure?
C: CANDACE
D: He gives me one every week.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BED ROOM - DUSK
N: Charlie sits on his bed, reading To Kill a Mockingbird, the cover taped back together. We see Derek's mix... Autumn Leaves... rotate in his old tape recorder.
C: DEREK
D: Hey, Babe. This next one might be a little sad, but it reminded me of your eyes.
E: V.O.
N: The first notes of The Smiths' "Asleep" begins. As Morrissey sings, Charlie keeps reading. And reading.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: The reading is done. Charlie proudly puts To Kill a Mockingbird on his newly dubbed "Shelf of Fame."
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
N: The songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to day life over the next few weeks. Charlie exits his English class. FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by...
C: SMART ASS FRESHMAN
D: Did you already do the term paper on To
N: Silence. They grab and drag him into the boy's room. We hear the toilet flush for the swirly.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
N: Charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin. He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with RC cola.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Charlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions on TV. He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him.
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: Charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria. Not giving up. Looking for somewhere to sit.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: Charlie sits by himself in the corner. He looks around the cafeteria, wanting to break in. Not knowing how. After a moment, he returns to his book. The song ends.
S: EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT
N: Friday Night Football in Western, PA. Charlie buys his Coke and nachos and wanders to the bleachers. He sits alone, trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students. When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears...
C: PATRICK
D: Come on Devils! Woooooo!
N: Charlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off. TWIN SENIOR GIRLS pass him, taunting.
C: TWIN SENIOR GIRLS
D: Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.
C: PATRICK
D: Suck it, virginity pledges!
N: Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly. After driving himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey... Patrick.
C: PATRICK
D: Hey! You're in my shop class, right? How's your clock coming?
C: CHARLIE
D: My dad's building it.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah. Mine looks like a boat. You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends?
E: off Charlie's awkward silence
C: CHARLIE
D: No. I'll sit if that's okay.
N: Patrick motions for Charlie to sit. Charlie sits. Elated.
C: PATRICK
D: Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by the way. It's an endless nightmare. And these assholes actually think they're being original.
N: Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field. Charlie dries his hands on his pants. So nervous. A 5 second silence that feels like a year. Think of something to say. Anything.
C: CHARLIE
D: So, uh... you like football?
C: PATRICK
D: Love it.
C: CHARLIE
D: Then, maybe you know my broth--
C: PATRICK
D: Hey, Sam.
N: Charlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's ever seen. SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every father nervous. She is alive, adventurous, and a world class flirt. Great attitude. Great taste. Great banter.
C: SAM
D: Question. Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting?
C: PATRICK
D: Yes, they call it the men's room.
N: Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick. Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy.
C: SAM
D: Well, I finally got hold of Bob.
C: PATRICK
D: Party tonight?
C: SAM
D: No. He's still trying to shag that waitress from the Olive Garden.
C: PATRICK
D: He's never tossing that salad.
N: Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field. The kids clap. Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick.
C: SAM
D: Patrick... who's this?
E: about Charlie
C: PATRICK
D: This is...
C: CHARLIE
D: Uh... Charlie... Kelmeckis.
C: PATRICK
D: Kelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?
C: CHARLIE
D: Is that what they call him?
C: SAM
D: Awww. Leave Pony Tail Derek alone. You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.
C: PATRICK
D: I try, Sam. I try.
C: SAM
D: It's nice to meet you, Charlie. I'm Sam.
N: Sam extends her hand to Charlie. Every nail a different color. They shake. Then, Sam grabs a nacho. Zoinks!
C: PATRICK
D: So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house?
C: SAM
D: Can't. She got caught watering down her parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's just go to Kings.
C: PATRICK
D: Hey... we're going to Kings after the game if you want to come.
E: turns to Charlie
N: Charlie nods just as Brad Hays tosses a touchdown pass. The fans go crazy. Especially Patrick. Charlie smiles.
S: INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter! The place is packed. Patrick and Sam drink coffee while Charlie eats his brownie. They're all excited.
C: SAM
D: Do you have a favorite band?
C: CHARLIE
D: I think The Smiths are my favorite.
C: SAM
D: Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths! The best breakup band ever. What's your favorite song?
C: CHARLIE
D: Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.
C: PATRICK
D: That works on so many levels.
C: CHARLIE
D: I could make a copy for you.
C: SAM
D: Thanks. What about Eide's? You love Eide's, right?
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah. They're great.
E: never heard of it
C: PATRICK
D: Not a band, Charlie.
C: SAM
D: It's an old record store downtown.
C: PATRICK
D: I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music. So, watch out, Charlie. She'll ruin your life forever.
C: CHARLIE
D: That's okay.
N: Brad Hays, the quarterback, passes with his posse. Taunting. NOSE TACKLE & LINEBACKER Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.
C: PATRICK
D: Let it go! Jesus! It's an old joke! It's over!
N: Sam laughs. She loves watching Patrick get riled up.
C: SAM
D: So, Charlie... what are you going to do when you get out of here?
C: CHARLIE
D: My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about.
C: SAM
D: You could write about us.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon. Make us solve crimes.
N: Sam laughs. Charlie smiles.
C: CHARLIE
D: You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? What?
E: off their laughs
C: SAM
D: He's my step-brother. My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago.
C: PATRICK
D: But Sam's not bitter. Make no mistake.
C: SAM
D: Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic. I'm a bulim-ist.
N: They laugh at their inside joke. Charlie has no idea what's so funny.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm sorry. I don't know what that means.
C: PATRICK
D: She just really believes in bulimia.
C: SAM
D: I love bulimia.
E: cracking up
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck. The music blares.
C: PATRICK
D: Thanks for paying, Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey... maybe I'll see you around in school?
E: so eager
C: SAM
D: God, would you turn that down? You're going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie.
E: distracted - to Patrick
C: PATRICK
D: Bye, Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay. Bye.
N: Charlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face. The happiness from one night of company.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news. He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement.
S: INT. DOORWAY TO BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting.
C: DEREK
D: I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it. Please talk to me.
E: O.S.
C: CANDACE
D: Maybe your mom and I should have a "drive us to our hair appointment" contest. Then, I could spend a Saturday with you.
E: O.S.
N: Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find...
C: DEREK
D: There's nothing I can do--
C: CANDACE
D: Do you always want to be a mama's boy?
C: DEREK
D: I am not a mama's boy--
C: CANDACE
D: Yes! You are! Every time I go to your house--
C: DEREK
D: Shhh. Shut u--
C: CANDACE
D: -- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy needs you to stay at home because she can't drive herself." She's only 51.
C: DEREK
D: SHUT UP, CANDACE!
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging.
C: CANDACE
D: And you just stand there like a little bitch dog.
N: SNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him.
C: CANDACE
D: Charlie, just go. I can handle it. Just don't wake up mom and dad.
E: CONT'D
N: She pushes him out of the room and closes the door.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Charlie sits at his desk. So disturbed. He hears a car start outside. He moves to his window and looks down at Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss. Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.
C: MOTHER
D: Hey, look who's here...
E: V.O.
N: FLASHBACK TO:
S: INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN entering the house. Aunt Helen carries a suitcase. The children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad. They just know they love her. Little Charlie stands at the top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday clothes. There are balloons. And streamers.
C: LITTLE CANDACE
D: Welcome home, Aunt Helen!
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Oh. Look at you all, dressed so nice.
N: Aunt Helen smiles at Little Charlie on top of the stairs.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the house. She is startled when she sees Charlie. They whisper.
C: CHARLIE
D: What are you doing?
C: CANDACE
D: Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's never hit me before. I promise he'll never hit me again.
N: She's about to go back downstairs when...
C: CHARLIE
D: Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
N: A silence passes between them. Then...
C: CANDACE
D: Charlie... this is Pony Tail Derek. I can handle him. Will you trust me? Please, don't tell mom and dad.
N: With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs. Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled.
S: INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
N: The Homecoming Dance is in full swing. God bless everyone. Especially Charlie. He's alone at the wall, dressed in his Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell. Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause. After a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of "Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.
C: SAM
D: Oh, my God. They're playing good music.
C: PATRICK
D: Holy shit. They are! They're playing good music!
C: SAM
D: Living room routine?
E: total mischief
C: PATRICK
D: Living room routine!
N: Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. It starts slow. "So over it" hand moves. A little shoulder. And then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius. Charlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them. He bobs his head like a dork. And once he gets close, Patrick and Sam turn and find him. SAM & PATRICK Hey! Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a circle. Their own island. After a moment, Sam moves around Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.
S: EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town. Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing.
C: SAM
D: God, it's freezing.
C: PATRICK
D: But you wore that toasty costume. It's not like you're trying too hard to be original.
C: SAM
D: Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.
C: CHARLIE
D: Are you sure it's okay that I come?
C: SAM
D: Of course. Just remember, Charlie... Bob's not paranoid.
C: PATRICK
D: "He's sensitive."
N: Sam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so often that people can't tell the difference anymore.
C: BOB
D: Sam... that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?
C: SAM
D: Only if I have Patrick's blessing.
C: BOB
D: Patrick?
C: PATRICK
D: You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say "no" on that one, but nice try. Charlie?
N: Patrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam.
C: BOB
D: Touché.
S: INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
C: PATRICK
D: Charlie... this is a party.
N: The music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed with kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a watermelon.
C: PATRICK
D: This is what fun looks like.
E: CONT'D
N: Patrick smiles when he spots two friends.
C: PATRICK
D: You ready to meet some desperate women?
E: CONT'D
N: MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together. Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary Elizabeth's "beta female."
C: PATRICK
D: Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies.
E: CONT'D
N: They shake hands and say their hellos.
C: PATRICK
D: This is Charlie's first party ever. So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you.
E: CONT'D
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Patrick, you're such a dick.
C: PATRICK
D: Where the hell did you go?
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: The dance was a little boring, don't you think?
C: PATRICK
D: You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Cry me a river.
C: PATRICK
D: How is it that you got meaner since
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Just lucky I guess.
C: PATRICK
D: I think you're doing something wrong.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Or something very right.
N: Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam calls out from the other side of the room.
C: SAM
D: Hey! Look who's here!
E: O.S.
N: The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback, enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked.
C: CHARLIE
D: Is that Brad Hays?
C: ALICE
D: Yeah. He comes here sometimes.
C: CHARLIE
D: But he's a popular kid.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Then, what are we?
E: offended
N: Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't. The girls turn, ignoring him. Bob approaches with a tray.
C: BOB
D: Charlie, you look like you could use a brownie.
C: CHARLIE
D: Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks.
N: Bob smiles. Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance. Charlie bites into the brownie. The icing gushing between his teeth. The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale as he chews and chews and chews.
S: INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - LATER
N: After a beat, the music changes, and the image exhales back down to Charlie, who is now... baked out of his mind. The whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks.
C: CHARLIE
D: Have you guys felt this carpet? This carpet feels so darn good.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Charlie, what do you think about high school?
E: laughing
C: CHARLIE
D: High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: This kid is crazy.
N: Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut.
C: CHARLIE
D: And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs. I'm really sorry. That sounded like a compliment in my head.
E: off their laughter
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Oh, my God!
C: ALICE
D: Well, it's kind of true.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Shut up!
N: Sam enters the room. Takes quick stock. Then...
C: SAM
D: Bob, did you get him stoned?
C: BOB
D: Come on, Sam. He likes it. Just look at him.
C: SAM
D: How do you feel, Charlie?
C: CHARLIE
D: I just really want a milkshake.
N: The entire room explodes with laughter. Charlie loves that people find him so funny.
S: INT. BOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender. Charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake.
C: CHARLIE
D: Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself. You know what I mean?
C: SAM
D: Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milkshake.
C: CHARLIE
D: What a great word. Milkshake. It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy.
C: SAM
D: I'm guessing you've never been high before?
C: CHARLIE
D: Me? No. My best friend Michael. His dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all that stuff. Parties, too.
C: SAM
D: Well, where is Michael tonight?
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, he shot himself last May.
N: Sam looks up. Shocked silent. Charlie is just stoned.
C: CHARLIE
D: I kind of wish he'd left a note. You know what I mean? Where's the bathroom?
E: CONT'D off her sad nod
C: SAM
D: It's up the stairs.
N: CHARLIE Charlie wanders off. Sam watches him go.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in a large ornate mirror in the hallway.
C: CHARLIE
D: Charlie. Charlie. Weird.
N: Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost. He finds the door to the master bedroom and opens it. He sees Patrick and Brad Hays... kissing.
C: CHARLIE
D: Woah.
E: CONT'D
C: PATRICK
D: Charlie?
C: BRAD HAYS
D: Who is that kid?
E: nervous
C: PATRICK
D: Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine. Stay here.
N: Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: I didn't see anything.
C: PATRICK
D: I know you saw something, but it's okay.
N: Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching.
C: PATRICK
D: Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to know... wait, are you baked?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: "Like a cake." That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny.
C: PATRICK
D: Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret.
C: CHARLIE
D: Our little secret. Agreed.
C: PATRICK
D: Thank you. We'll talk later.
C: CHARLIE
D: I look forward to that big talk.
N: Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door.
S: INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: The party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth.
C: CHARLIE
D: Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one.
N: Patrick walks downstairs. Sam motions him over.
C: SAM
D: I need to talk to you. Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself. I don't think he has any friends.
E: barely audible whisper
N: Patrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd.
C: PATRICK
D: Everyone. Raise your glasses to Charlie.
N: Charlie looks up. A little paranoid. Everyone is staring.
C: CHARLIE
D: What did I do?
C: PATRICK
D: You didn't do anything. We just want to toast our new friend. You see things. And you understand. You're a wallflower.
E: off his look
N: Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants. He looks around the room at the nods and friendly faces.
C: PATRICK
D: What is it? What's wrong?
E: CONT'D
N: CHARLIE
C: PATRICK
D: Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone...
N: SAM & EVERYONE To Charlie. They all drink. Sam approaches him. A knowing smile.
C: SAM
D: Welcome to the island of misfit toys.
N: Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT./INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT
N: The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Patrick drives. Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel Song." The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our prototype for tone.
C: SAM
D: My God. What is this song!?
C: PATRICK
D: Right? I have no idea.
C: SAM
D: Have you heard it before?
E: to Charlie
C: CHARLIE
D: Never.
C: SAM
D: Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!
E: light bulb
C: PATRICK
D: Sam, it's freezing.
C: SAM
D: Patrick, it's the perfect song!
C: PATRICK
D: No. Mama Patrick says no.
C: SAM
D: Patrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to you, I'm begging you to drive me--
C: PATRICK
D: Alright! I concede!
E: laughing
N: Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed. She grips the flood lights to steady herself as she stands.
C: CHARLIE
D: What is she doing?
C: PATRICK
D: Don't worry. She does it all the time.
C: SAM
D: Turn it up!
C: PATRICK
D: You got it, your highness.
N: Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel, just as the truck flies into... THE TUNNEL We go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the camera. Right at us. For we are now... Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit. So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.
C: PATRICK
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: I feel infinite.
N: The truck flies out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel onto the bridge. Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms. Free and young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
N: We see Charlie proudly put a Smiths poster on his wall next to photos of his new friends. He dances to his desk, listening to Air Supply's "All Out of Love" on his Walkman.
C: CHARLIE
D: Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but I've been trying hard not to be a loser.
E: V.O.
N: As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs...
C: AIR SUPPLY
D: I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.
N: Charlie sits at his desk, writing and lip-synching.
C: CHARLIE
D: For example, I am trying to participate by listening to Sam's collection of big rock ballads and thinking about love. Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant. I completely agree.
E: V.O.
S: INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: As the students file out, Charlie hands his paper to Bill in exchange for a beat up copy of The Great Gatsby.
C: CHARLIE
D: I am also studying extra books outside of class. As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer. He even had a play put up in New York once, which I think is very impressive. He and his wife might go back there after this year. I know this is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on his tray. He looks at the gang at their table. He sits with them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine.
C: CHARLIE
D: My favorite time, though, is lunch because I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky. Mary Elizabeth is really interesting because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a "long day."
E: V.O.
S: INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON
N: The xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY! Halloween Issue! Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog.
C: CHARLIE
D: Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school. She also steals jeans from the mall. I don't know why because her family is rich, but I'm trying not to be judgemental. Especially since I know how they were all there for Patrick last year. Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened.
E: V.O.
N: Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life. [Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.]
S: EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT
N: Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer. Moments later, Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field.
C: CHARLIE
D: When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: Patrick whispers while the gang studies their SAT books.
C: CHARLIE
D: Then, Monday in school, Brad would say, "Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember a thing." This went on for 7 months.
E: V.O.
S: INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING
N: Charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes. He turns to see Brad with his father and mother. Proper family. Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back.
C: CHARLIE
D: When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry.
E: V.O.
C: CHARLIE
D: saying his dad would kill him. And saying he was going to hell.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. LIBRARY - DAY
N: We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library. They reach the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they simply... PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD.
C: CHARLIE
D: Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
E: V.O.
N: Brad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying hard for her SAT's.
C: CHARLIE
D: I think that I understand because I really like Sam. I asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties. I guess she had a reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
N: We see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box.
C: CHARLIE
D: So, I've been making her a mix tape so she will know how I feel.
E: V.O.
N: The two cassettes run. The song is just about to finish when... the side runs out of tape and snaps off.
C: CHARLIE
D: Ah, shit!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT
N: The marquee announces it's time for the...
S: INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT
N: ... Rocky Horror Picture Show! The ROCKY EMCEE, dressed as Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy.
C: ROCKY EMCEE CROWD
D: Gimme an R! Gimme an O! R-O-C-K-Y! Rocky! Rocky! Gimme a C! Gimme a K! Gimme Rocky! a Y! What's that spell!?
N: The crowd cheers! Charlie claps from the front row.
S: INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER
N: The movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly. Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in full drag is... Patrick.
C: PATRICK
D: Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same.
N: Patrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing! Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling.
C: PATRICK
D: Give yourself over to absolute pleasure. Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any measure. And sensual daydreams to treasure forever. Can't you just see it? Woah oh oh!
E: CONT'D
N: Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick, Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt).
S: INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: We hear the chorus of "Don't Dream It, Be It" as Charlie watches all of the exciting cast members at the after-show party. Charlie sees a photo of Sam's naked back on the wall of Craig's loft. Very arty. Very black & white. Charlie's lust (and guilt) are now at 11. Alice looks at the photo.
C: ALICE
D: It's gorgeous, Craig. What did you use?
N: Craig is impressive to high school kids. He's a little pretentious. But his art school life. His red wine. His loft. Wow. Right now, he holds court in the wine line.
C: CRAIG
D: Color film, but black and white paper for the printing. My professor gave me an "A," but for the wrong reasons. Most of them are idiots. You'll see what I mean when you get to college. How were your SAT's by the way?
C: ALICE
D: 1150. I think I'll get into NYU.
E: worried
C: CRAIG
D: Yeah, I hope so.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: 1490. Harvard. Face!
E: cruel to Alice
S: INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Charlie sees Sam alone on the loft steps. She looks a little down. He hands Sam a plastic cup and sits next to her.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey. Are you okay?
C: SAM
D: Yeah. Yeah. But I got my SAT results back. Oops.
C: CHARLIE
D: You can take them again.
C: SAM
D: Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn State main campus, I have to do much better. I wish I would have studied freshman year. I was a bit of a mess.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'll help you study for the next one.
C: SAM
D: Will you?
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, of course.
C: SAM
D: Thanks, Charlie.
N: Charlie summons his courage. He hands her the mix tape.
C: SAM
D: What's this?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Just a mix tape. No big deal. My parents have a pretty good stereo. It's all about that night in the tunnel. I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so--
C: SAM
D: It's okay. These are great. You have really good taste, Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: Really?
C: SAM
D: Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman. I used to listen to the worst top 40.
C: CHARLIE
D: No.
C: SAM
D: Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something. And I'd look up and see this person across the room. And from that moment, I'd know everything was going to be okay. You know what I mean?
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah.
E: devastated in love
S: INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER
N: The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad. Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade. Like she is dancing with him. But she isn't. A wider angle reveals that she is slow dancing with... Craig. Charlie is 15 year old CRUSHED. No filter. Just feeling. Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room.
C: ALICE
D: So, what do you think?
C: PATRICK
D: I don't know.
C: ALICE
D: I hope it works out. Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: No, shit. Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?
C: PATRICK
D: I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. I keep telling her... don't make yourself small. You can't save anybody.
N: Craig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends. Sam goes into the kitchen. Craig approaches Charlie. Turns off his mix tape.
C: CRAIG
D: Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How about something a little more upbeat?
N: Craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down.
C: CRAIG
D: Sam tells me you want to be a writer.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah.
C: ALICE
D: Don't you write poetry, Craig?
C: CRAIG
D: No. Poetry writes me. You know?
N: Charlie sighs. Craig's upbeat song begins to play. He dances over to Sam. Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam hug on Craig.
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: In a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers. Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall.
S: INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING
N: The bell rings. Charlie sets down his On the Road paper.
C: BILL
D: Wow. That was fast. You want another one?
N: Charlie nods. Bill smiles and reaches into his desk. He hands Charlie a copy of A Separate Piece. Charlie takes the book and starts to walk out, but he turns back.
C: CHARLIE
D: Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something?
C: BILL
D: Yeah.
C: CHARLIE
D: Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date?
C: BILL
D: Are we talking about anyone specific?
N: Charlie nods. Bill looks straight at him. Not preaching. Coming from a history of personal experience and pain.
C: BILL
D: We accept the love we think we deserve.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Can we make them know they deserve more?
C: BILL
D: We can try.
N: Charlie smiles.
S: INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - MORNING
N: Charlie waits nervously at a booth. He sees Sam enter. He fixes his hair, then pretends to read his SAT PREP BOOK.
C: SAM
D: Hey, Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in. You want to work on probabilities and statistics?
N: Sam nods. They open their books, and a Christmas song begins. In a quick passage of time, we see them study next to Halloween decorations. Then, Thanksgiving. And finally, Christmas decorations.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The song continues. Charlie's mom and sister hang the Christmas ornaments as Charlie helps his dad find that "one
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey, dad. Can I have 30 dollars?
C: FATHER
D: 20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars for?
E: old joke
C: CHARLIE
D: Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please.
N: Charlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a bill. It's a fifty. Dad winks, in a great mood.
C: FATHER
D: Have fun.
C: CHARLIE
D: Thanks.
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
N: Lockers are opened by Charlie. Sam. Patrick. Wrapped gifts are deposited. Mischief smiles. Lockers closed. Everyone loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks.
S: INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the Rye. He smiles.
C: BILL
D: Charlie... this was my favorite book growing up. This is my copy, but I want you to have it.
C: CHARLIE
D: Thanks.
C: BILL
D: Have a great Christmas break.
C: CHARLIE
D: You too, Mr. Anderson.
S: INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY
N: Mr. Callahan, the shop teacher, looks at a Sad Sack Girl's clock. He takes a moment, and then...
C: MR. CALLAHAN
D: Terrible stain.
N: He moves to Charlie's dad's amazing clock. He hands Charlie an A on a piece of paper.
C: MR. CALLAHAN
D: That's pretty good, Charlie.
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Callahan moves to Patrick's SHITTY WOODEN CLOCK. No stain. No finish. Lop-sided. The ugliest clock you've ever seen in your life.
C: MR. CALLAHAN
D: You've got to be kidding me.
E: CONT'D
C: PATRICK
D: If you fail me, you get me next semester.
N: Mr. Callahan writes a grade and slaps it down.
S: EXT. WEST END OVERLOOK - NIGHT
N: The song continues as Patrick holds up the grade. C minus! Charlie and Sam cheer as Patrick screams at the top of his lungs...
C: PATRICK
D: Woo! C Minus! It's over! It's over! Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!
C: SAM
D: Below average!
N: Patrick screams at the city in the distance. Below average!
S: INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT
N: We move to find Sam, holding her SAT score up to the group.
C: SAM
D: Hey, guys. 1210.
N: Everyone cheers. Sam hugs Charlie.
S: INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - GAMES ROOM - NIGHT
N: Charlie carries Sam on his shoulders past the Christmas Tree. Sam wears a Santa Hat like a hot elf.
C: SAM
D: No more applications! No more SAT's! Thank you, Charlie!
N: They pass Mary Elizabeth as she opens her final present.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Multiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This is a really tough one, but I'm going to have to guess... Alice.
N: Alice smiles. Bob nudges her. Guilty as charged. Mary Elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Wait, guys... a receipt! She actually paid!
E: CONT'D
C: PATRICK
D: Impossible!
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: I'm so touched.
N: Alice laughs. Patrick pours everyone brandy. The kids look ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous.
C: CHARLIE
D: Where's Craig?
C: SAM
D: He went home to Connecticut. He'll be back for New Year's Eve.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.
N: Sam nods, then turns. Charlie is delighted. No Craig. The kids settle in the living room in front of the fire.
C: SAM
D: Alright, big brother by 3 weeks. Who's your secret santa?
C: PATRICK
D: I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and a mix with the song "Asleep" on it... twice.
N: Charlie starts snickering. He can't help himself.
C: PATRICK
D: I mean, I have no idea. This collection of presents is so gay that I think I must have given them to myself. But despite that distinct possibility, I'm going to have to go with... drum roll... Charlie.
E: CONT'D
N: Charlie holds up his hands. Yay! They all cheer.
C: SAM
D: Alright, Charlie... it's your turn.
N: Charlie and Patrick switch places. Charlie stands.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.
C: PATRICK
D: Huh. Now, why do you say that?
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't know. She bosses people around sometimes.
N: The gang cracks up. Mary Elizabeth is pissed.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: What the hell is wrong with you?
C: CHARLIE
D: Sorry.
C: PATRICK
D: Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually... me.
C: CHARLIE
D: You got me clothes? Why?
C: PATRICK
D: Because all the great writers used to wear great suits. Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve into our facilities. Emerge a star.
N: Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents.
C: CHARLIE
D: Can you hand these out while I'm gone?
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Wait a second. There's only secret santa presents. There are rules, Charlie.
C: PATRICK
D: Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas? Hand them out, Sam.
N: Sam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription...
C: ALICE
D: "Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."
N: Alice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with...
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: 40 dollars. "To print Punk Rocky in color next time."
E: reads card
N: Bob blows soap bubbles into the air. Stoned. Mesmerized.
C: BOB
D: He knows me. He really knows me.
N: Sam looks at her present. An old 45 record of The Beatles classic "Something" with a card. She reads the card. Holds it to her chest. Very moved.
C: SAM
D: Come on out, Charlie.
N: They all chime in. "Let's go, young man!" "Charlie! Charlie!" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals... Charlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the cover. They all clap. It's magic.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah! What a display of man I have ever seen!
N: Sam and Charlie look at each and smile.
S: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: The door opens. Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room.
C: CHARLIE
D: Where are we going?
C: SAM
D: It's a surprise.
N: Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says "The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves." Virgin Mary icons. Snow globes. Kitsch.
C: CHARLIE
D: Is this your room? It's so cool.
C: SAM
D: Thanks.
N: Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.
C: CHARLIE
D: You got me a present?
C: SAM
D: With all that help on my Penn State application? Of course I did. Open it.
N: Charlie lifts up the box to reveal an OLD MANUAL TYPEWRITER.
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't know what to say.
C: SAM
D: You don't have to say anything.
N: Sam goes over and types. "Write about us sometime." He smiles and types back. "I will." They look at each other. We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs.
C: SAM
D: I'm sorry we can't be here for your birthday.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad.
C: SAM
D: I'm in such a great mood, I don't think even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm finally doing good.
C: CHARLIE
D: You are.
C: SAM
D: Me? What about you? When I met you, you were this scared freshman. And look at you in that suit. You're like a sexy English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
C: CHARLIE
D: No.
E: innocent laugh
C: SAM
D: Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see you coming. And parents love you. That's like... extra danger.
C: CHARLIE
D: Well, it hasn't worked so far.
C: SAM
D: Come on. You've never had a girlfriend? Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
N: He shakes his head.
C: SAM
D: Have you ever kissed a girl?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: No. What about you?
C: SAM
D: Have I ever kissed a girl?
C: CHARLIE
D: No! Your first kiss...
E: laughs
N: Sam gets this strange look in her eyes. A little haunted.
C: SAM
D: My first kiss? I was 11. His name was Robert. He would come over to the house all the time.
C: CHARLIE
D: Was he your first boyfriend?
C: SAM
D: He was my dad's boss.
N: Charlie goes silent.
C: SAM
D: You know Charlie, I used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit. And get wasted all the time. But now... I feel like I have a chance. I could even get into a real college.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: It's true. You can do it.
N: SAM
C: CHARLIE
D: My Aunt... she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life around.
C: SAM
D: She must have been great.
C: CHARLIE
D: She was my favorite person in the world... until now.
N: Sam smiles. She's very moved.
C: SAM
D: Charlie, I know that you know I like Craig. But I want to forget that for a minute. Okay? I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you. Okay?
N: Charlie nods. And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him. It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him. Holding on for lonely life. When the song crescendos, and they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other. Finally...
C: SAM
D: I love you, Charlie.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: I love you, too.
S: EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The porch lights are as golden as Charlie feels right now. We see the girls wave to each other and hug Sam.
C: GANG
D: "Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your dad's!" "See you at New Year's!"
N: Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway.
C: CHARLIE
D: Have a good time at your mom's.
C: PATRICK
D: Thanks. And Charlie... since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart.
C: CHARLIE
D: Thank you, Patrick.
N: Sam gives Charlie one last hug. Patrick and Sam watch their friends leave.
C: PATRICK
D: I love you guys!
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH - NIGHT
N: We fly as high as Charlie feels. Above the city on Christmas Eve.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad.
C: FATHER
D: Hey! Look who's here!
N: He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19). Chris is handsome, charismatic, and an all around winner.
C: CHRIS
D: Come here, little sister.
C: CANDACE
D: Hey, Chris.
N: Big hug. Chris smiles big and "son flirts" with his mom.
C: CHRIS
D: Ma, you look so thin!
C: MOTHER
D: 10 pounds... Weight Watchers.
N: Big kiss. When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles.
C: CHRIS
D: Charlie...
N: Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence. Then, hug. As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris gives him a quiet...
C: CHRIS
D: Happy birthday.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
C: MOTHER
D: Make a wish, honey.
N: We move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out his 16 candles.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags. The suburb is quiet. Not a creature is stirring. Except... Charlie. He fills a brown paper bag with sand and a candle. He lights the candle, making the bag glow like a beautiful lantern. He looks down his street, where families are out with their kids, doing the same luminaria ritual.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: The same street. Christmas Eve. Many years ago. Aunt Helen and the kids finish their luminaria bags. Aunt Helen lights up the candles. They glow.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus.
N: The image goes wide. All of these bags glowing. Beautiful. Aunt Helen rattles her keys. Whispers.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Keep an eye out for him with your brother and sister. I'll be right back.
E: CONT'D
N: She bends down and whispers into his ear.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: I'm going to get your birthday present.
E: CONT'D
N: She musses his hair and gets in the car. END FLASHBACK
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: Charlie hovers over the glowing luminaria. Something is bothering him. He shakes it off.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Charlie wanders through the quiet house. He turns the corner where he finds Chris sitting at the table. He's lit by a couple of candles and the blinking lights of the Christmas Tree. He's surrounded by leftovers. Charlie sits.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey.
N: Chris chews and swallows. Famished. They both whisper.
C: CHRIS
D: Hey. God, I missed mom's cooking. You have no idea how good you have it. I'm actually beginning to hate pizza.
N: Charlie smiles. Grabs a Hershey Kiss cookie.
C: CHARLIE
D: How are you liking school?
C: CHRIS
D: Not bad. I'm no brainiac like you or Candace. But I'm doing okay.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay? You're playing in a Bowl Game.
N: Chris laughs. Charlie smiles. A moment passes. Chris changes his tone. Cautious.
C: CHRIS
D: How are you feeling, Charlie?
C: CHARLIE
D: Good.
C: CHRIS
D: You know what I mean. Is it bad tonight?
C: CHARLIE
D: No.
C: CHRIS
D: No?
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off.
C: CHRIS
E: relieved
C: CHRIS
D: now. And maybe if it does get bad again, you can just talk to them, yeah?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask her out at New Years. I think the time is right now.
N: Chris smiles at his kid brother. We hear the church organ.
S: INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CHURCH - MORNING
N: The family moves down the line to receive Holy Communion at Christmas Mass. Charlie's father, then mother, then sister, take the sacrament. Charlie is next. The PRIEST makes the motion of the cross with the communion wafer. He places it in Charlie's hand. Charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth with his fingers...
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. BOB'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: We move in closer to Charlie's fingers in his mouth. When he takes his hand out, we see... a tab of LSD. The church organ is now a rock organ. And it's now... New Year's Eve. Charlie closes his mouth. He looks down the hall of the smoky room where Craig has his arm around Sam. Charlie turns to Mary Elizabeth, who's also dosed.
C: CHARLIE
D: How long does this take to work?
S: EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: About 45 minutes. The sound is muted thick. Slight echoes. Charlie shovels the snow. Crunch. Fascinated by his breath making fog. Sam comes outside. She's worried about him.
C: SAM
D: Shoveling snow, huh?
C: CHARLIE
D: I have to get this driveway clean. Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it.
C: SAM
D: You said that an hour ago.
C: CHARLIE
D: Was that tonight? God. I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then
C: SAM
D: Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out. Just give me the shovel. Calm down. Look up.
N: She points. Charlie looks up. Sees the stars.
C: SAM
D: Isn't it quiet?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?
C: SAM
D: All the time. So, you want to put on these glasses? They'll protect you.
N: Sam puts her arm around his shoulder. Protecting him. Charlie looks through the glasses. The sky bends like a globe. When he breathes, the sky ripples.
S: INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Charlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind. He sits down on the sofa. The world unbends as Charlie takes off the glasses. Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts of themselves behind. Charlie looks upstairs to find... Sam and Craig kissing. Craig leads her to the bedroom. Charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the New Years countdown. Patrick leads the charge.
C: PATRICK
D: 10-9-8...
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: In a QUICK FLASH, we see 7 year old Charlie with Aunt Helen on Christmas Eve. She bends to whisper in his ear.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: It'll be our little secret, all right?
S: INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: We are BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie takes a deep breath and tries to remember that he's at a New Year's party.
C: PATRICK
D: 7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year!
N: The crowd cheers, leaving ghosts of themselves. Charlie gets up from the sofa and walks out of Bob's house.
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT
N: Charlie walks down the road under a streetlight. Silhouette. The road is icy. Charlie lays down and starts moving his arms in the snow. The memories begin to haunt him.
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: 7 year old Charlie waves goodbye to Aunt Helen as she drives away through the landing strip for Santa Claus.
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: 16 year old Charlie blinks. The memories come faster.
S: INT. AUNT HELEN'S CAR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Aunt Helen drives past a tall snow drift. She looks down at the 45 of The Beatles in the seat next to her. She smiles at Charlie's birthday present. Then, she looks up as the headlights of the semi truck smash the windows with a CRASH!
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: Charlie's mother opens the door, revealing a POLICEMAN. He turns to Charlie in his party hat. 7 years old and confused.
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)
N: 16 year old Charlie lays on the snow, shivering, as the image goes high above to reveal he's made a snow angel.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: The Emergency room is bustling on New Year's Day. Charlie looks up as the POLICE, DOCTORS, and his PARENTS tower over him. He is terrified and does what any kid would do. He lies his ass off.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Did your older friends pressure you?
C: CHARLIE
D: No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning?
C: CHARLIE
D: Well, um... I was really tired, and uh... I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out.
N: He waits to see if this worked. And then, unexpectedly...
C: MOTHER
D: You're seeing things again, Charlie?
E: worried
C: CHARLIE
D: Not, uh... Not really.
E: oops
S: EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - MORNING
N: The tires squish the grey slush puddle as the busses pull into the dreary parking lot. School is back in session.
S: INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Charlie shakes off the cold, then takes off his overcoat to reveal... he's wearing his suit from Secret Santa. All the kids stare. Charlie realizes he made a terrible mistake.
C: CHARLIE
D: It was a Christmas present.
S: INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: Charlie sits as Bill hands out the book for the semester... The Great Gatsby. As the kids chatter, Bill gives Charlie his own book to start the year... The Stranger.
C: CHARLIE
D: Did you have fun on your break?
C: BILL
D: More fun than you're going to have today, Sinatra.
N: Bill pats his shoulder and moves on. The Smart Ass Freshman looks at Charlie and whispers.
C: SMART ASS FRESHMAN
D: Nice look, jag off.
S: EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
N: The Rocky Horror faithful enter the theater.

D: I called him 30 times.

S: INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mary Elizabeth and the kids get ready for the floor show.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Well what are we supposed to do? We're going on in 10 minutes!
N: The phone rings. Mary Elizabeth picks up. Charlie turns to Brad, sitting next to him. Charlie is freaking out.
C: CHARLIE
D: But they said in health class--
C: BRAD HAYS
D: They say that about LSD to scare you.
C: CHARLIE
D: Are you sure?
C: BRAD HAYS
D: Charlie, you're fine, man.
N: Mary Elizabeth hangs up the phone, frustrated.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Guys, we have an emergency. Craig flaked out on us again. I need a Rocky. Brad?
C: BRAD HAYS
D: No way. There are people out here.
E: scared
N: The group is deflated. They all start thinking. After a beat, Mary Elizabeth looks at Charlie.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Charlie... take off your clothes.
S: INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER
N: You know those dreams you have when you are standing in front of 200 people in your underwear? Well, this is no dream. We hear a heart beat as Charlie dances out of the Rocky gauze and finds himself standing in tight gold underwear, looking out at 200 people, cheering him on. His friends can't stop smiling. Especially Mary Elizabeth, who watches Charlie's little butt in the gold undies. She
S: INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER
N: "Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me" is in full swing. Sam slinks over to Charlie dressed in her white bra and slip.
C: SAM
D: So if anything grows while you pose. I'll oil you up and drop you down. And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction. You need a friendly hand. And I need action!
E: as Janet
N: Sam grabs Charlie's hands and rubs them all over her chest.
C: SAM
D: Ah! Touch a touch a touch me! I wanna be dirty! Thrill me. Chill me. Fulfill me! Creature of the night!
E: CONT'D
N: The song continues. We see flashes of the night's performance as Charlie goes from train wreck to triumph. Charlie joins Sam in the kick line, and it feels like it's just the two of them. On the final beat, Sam gasps...
C: SAM
D: Creature of the night!
E: CONT'D
N: The song ends. The cast bows. Sam and Patrick push Charlie in front for his own curtain call. Everyone cheers. It's the night he'll never forget.
S: EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
N: The wind whips. That bracing February cold. Charlie helps Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car.
C: CHARLIE
D: Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something?
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college. I could put in a good word for you.
C: CHARLIE
D: That'd be great. Thanks.
N: They put the box in her trunk. Snap it closed. We can't help but notice the "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" bumper sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Charlie... have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?
C: CHARLIE
D: The one where the girl asks the guy.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist. It's like, "Hey, thanks for the crumb." And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture. But, you know, it's my last year, and... would you maybe want to go with me?
C: CHARLIE
D: You want to go with me?
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked really cute in your costume. So, what do you say?
N: Charlie thinks and thinks and...
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK
N: Ding dong. Charlie's mom opens the door for MARY ELIZABETH. Charlie straightens out his church suit. So nervous.
C: MOTHER
D: You must be Mary Elizabeth. It's so good to meet you.

D: You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
C: FATHER
D: Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.

S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - FIREPLACE - DUSK
N: Charlie and Mary Elizabeth stand next to Candace and Derek.
C: FATHER
D: OK, a little closer together. That looks nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more. There you go. Nice.
N: Cheese! White flash. The picture of 4 kids. Smiling big.
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
N: Charlie and Mary Elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song. Sweaty palms. Awkward. Hands on hips. Horror. Charlie looks around the gym. He sees Alice dancing with her date, an EFFEMINATE GOTH KID (17). We'll never meet him, but he'll make us laugh once. Charlie then watches Patrick dance with Sam. He follows Patrick's gaze across the floor to Brad, who dances with a SENIOR GIRL (18). Charlie sees the boys look at each other. For one moment, it's like they're dancing together.
S: INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER
N: Mary Elizabeth is at the punch bowl with the gang. Charlie sees Sam, standing by the wall, looking sad. He approaches.
C: CHARLIE
D: Are you having a good time?
C: SAM
D: Not really. How about you?
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to.
C: SAM
D: Don't worry. You're doing fine.
N: Charlie joins her at the wall. Mary Elizabeth gives them a quick, jealous look.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm sorry Craig didn't come.
C: SAM
D: Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance. Can't say I blame him.
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't know. If you like it, he should come.
C: SAM
D: Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first date. You deserve it.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'll try not to make you too jealous.
N: He said it to cheer her up. Sam forces a smile and leaves.
S: INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mary Elizabeth approaches Charlie on the antique sofa. She uncorks a bottle of wine. POP! She hands him the bottle.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Mmmm. Now, let it breathe.
N: Mary Elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable. She turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control. Roar!
C: CHARLIE
D: This is sure a nice house.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Thanks.
N: Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl LP. A Doo Wop make-out classic begins to play. She dances over to Charlie.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Mmmm. Don't you just love old music? Good. Because I made you a mix of it. I'd love to expose you to great things. Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.
E: CONT'D off his nod
N: She pours the wine. Charlie looks at the bottle.
C: CHARLIE
D: This merlot is really fancy.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?
C: CHARLIE
D: I guess. Where are your parents?
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Their club is hosting a cotillion or something racist. They'll be gone all night.
N: Mary Elizabeth drops her necklace with a thud. Charlie looks around. Heart beating.
C: CHARLIE
D: That's sure a nice fire.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Yeah. After I'm done being a lobbyist, I want to move to a house like this in Cape Cod. That sounds nice, doesn't it?
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah.
N: She reaches out and touches his chest.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Your heart is beating really fast.
C: CHARLIE
D: Is it?
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Here, feel.
N: She puts her hand on his. Moves it to his chest.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Charlie?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Uh-huh?
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Do you like me?
C: CHARLIE
D: Uh-huh.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: You know what I mean.
C: CHARLIE
D: I think so.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Don't be nervous.
N: She slowly moves his hand to her dress strap. It falls off her shoulder. She leans in for a red wine kiss. She guides his hand over her bra. He feels her breast. Wow.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S BASEMENT - FANTASY
N: For a quick moment, Charlie imagines he is kissing Sam. Broken by...
S: INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Mary Elizabeth moves his hand away. Charlie blinks, taking a moment to realize Sam's not the one in the room. The song is over. The needle turns at the end of the record.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Charlie...
N: She gives him one last kiss. Content, she lays down on his lap. Peaceful.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: I didn't know how it was going to go tonight, but it was really nice, huh?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: I can't believe it. You of all people. I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.
N: We land on Charlie's face. "What?" And then, we hear the GARAGE DOOR OPEN.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Oh, shit! My parents!
E: CONT'D
N: The mad scramble for clothes begins.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Mary Elizabeth's car pulls in front of Charlie's house. Charlie gets out. Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend. Not knowing how. Mary Elizabeth smiles. Smitten.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: See you Monday.
N: With that, she backs out of the driveway. We see him from the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller. His stomach already filling with acid.
C: CHARLIE
D: Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: Sam, Patrick, and Alice are seated around the table. Mary Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie. Smothering him.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: We're literally making out, and I'm in my bra. Hello! And the front door opens. It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe?
N: Charlie nods, tortured.
C: CHARLIE
D: I probably should have been honest about how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING
N: Ash Wednesday. Charlie gets out of the school bus to immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him. She sees the cross of ashes on his forehead. She thinks his ashes are a smudge. She cleans it.
C: CHARLIE
D: You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone. And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy, I tried hard to love her like I love Sam.
E: V.O.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Can you believe it's almost our two week anniversary?
C: CHARLIE
D: I know.
S: EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
N: A double date. Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

D: Your first foreign film.
E: proud
N: CHARLIE
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Vegans don't eat butter.
N: Charlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand.
C: CHARLIE
D: And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Just like Sadie's except... the fire in the fireplace is out. We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater.
C: CHARLIE
D: And I had to admit something really upsetting. But I am tired of touching her boobs. I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music once in awhile, we might have a chance.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo. Sighs.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: The gang is there. Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray.
C: CHARLIE
D: And maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr. Anderson gives me.
E: V.O.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Walden? I read it in 7th grade. I would have called it "On Boring Pond."
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Ring! Charlie grabs the cordless. He looks at Patrick's clock. 3:13pm. His voice can no longer hide his quiet rage.
C: CHARLIE
D: Or if she would stop calling me the minute I get home from school when I have absolutely nothing to talk about other than the bus ride home...
E: V.O.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: That dairy just sits with you. It walks with you.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie calmly puts down the phone and leaves the room. We
S: INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Charlie is so miserable. His mom is sympathetic.
C: MOTHER
D: She's on the phone right now? Charlie, you have to break up with her.
C: CHARLIE
D: I can do that?
N: Charlie's father leans back from the sofa and his newspaper.
C: FATHER
D: For Christ's sake... I need to use the phone!
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: He returns. Mary Elizabeth is still talking on the cordless.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: I'll give you this book. It's really how I became a vegan--
E: V.O.
C: CHARLIE
D: I know I should have been honest, but I was getting so mad, it was starting to scare me.
E: V.O.
N: He looks back at the clock. 3:23pm.
C: CHARLIE
D: Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you--
E: CONT'D
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Charlie. Please, don't interrupt. You know I hate that.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie goes to his quiet place. Tick. Tick. Tick.
C: CHARLIE
D: I just wish I could have found another way to break up. In hindsight, I probably could not have picked a worse way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Truth or dare. The gang is seated in a circle, drinking from plastic cups. Charlie sits between Mary Elizabeth and Sam. BOB

D: Mary Elizabeth? Samantha told me that you got into Harvard. Congratulations.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Thank you. This one still hasn't gotten me flowers. But I forgive you.
E: re: Charlie to Charlie
N: She kisses him. Charlie bites his cheeks. Sam looks a little depressed.
C: CRAIG
D: Don't worry about Penn State. You're just wait-listed.
E: to Sam
C: PATRICK
D: Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing some hot "fag on goth" action.
N: Anticipation. Patrick is getting ready to plant the biggest kiss on Alice when she jumps him. Everyone groans. Ew! Laughter. Patrick looks for the next person. Charlie's heart pounds. Don't pick me! Please!
C: PATRICK
D: Okay. My turn. Um... let's think... Charlie... truth or dare?
E: CONT'D
N: Silence. Thinking. Finally...
C: CHARLIE
D: Truth.
C: PATRICK
D: How is your first relationship going?
C: CHARLIE
D: It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her.
C: PATRICK
D: Charlie? Truth or dare?
N: Charlie blinks. It was all fantasy.
C: CHARLIE
D: Dare.
C: PATRICK
D: I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips. Notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it... I'd smoke all you bitches.
N: Alice hits him. Laughter. Charlie thinks. He looks at Mary Elizabeth, then turns to Sam. Before Sam can even react... Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips. When he opens his eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his mistake. Everyone stares. After a horrible silence...
C: PATRICK
D: Now that's fucked up.
E: CONT'D
N: Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and goes into the kitchen.
C: CHARLIE
D: Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry. I'm--

C: CHARLIE
D: Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry.

C: PATRICK
D: I know you didn't, but look... I hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam. Other guys. Things that have nothing to do with you. But... it's best if you stay away for awhile.
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh. Okay. How long do you think?
E: crushed

N: Patrick storms off.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH
N: Charlie sits at his table, alone. He watches Patrick leave the lunch line, passing a chorus of... TWIN SENIOR GIRLS Patrick says nothing. He's too sad to fight the mob today. He just moves to his table when the Nose Tackle sticks out his leg. Patrick falls on his tray. The kids laugh.
C: NOSE TACKLE

C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: It's Patrick!
N: The cafeteria gets louder. The Nose Tackle holds Patrick up. More Noise. The Linebacker hits Patrick in the face.
C: SAM
D: No! No!
N: Sam rushes up and the Nose Tackle pushes her down. She lands on her tail bone. Thud. Patrick gets hit a couple of times in the face. The kids cheer the fight. It's getting louder and louder with more and more noise. And then...
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: Silence. Charlie comes out from a blink. He calmly looks around. For a moment, he doesn't understand where he is. He looks up. All the kids are staring at him. Mary Elizabeth. Alice. Brad. They are all quiet. Afraid of him. Charlie looks at his hand, clenched in a fist. It is already covered with... Charlie's confused until he sees the Linebacker holding his broken, bloody nose. He's looking at Charlie... Terrified. The image pans over. The Nose Tackle is on the ground. Charlie stands over them. He is disconnected. It's an out of body experience. He reaches out and helps Patrick to his feet. Then, he calmly turns and stares right through Brad.
C: CHARLIE
D: If you touch my friends again, I'll blind you.
E: icy calm
N: Brad is stunned. So is everyone... except Sam.

E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm just glad you're happy.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Okay.
N: Mary Elizabeth joins Peter. Charlie looks at his friends. that says, "They forget. I don't." After a beat, Patrick comes downstairs. He looks sad with his bruises.

C: CHARLIE
D: Maybe.
C: PATRICK
D: So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker. And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. So, she did it really proper. She packed a picnic. Stole a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. So, what do you think happened?
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't know.
C: PATRICK
D: They did it with one of the sandwich bags.
N: They start laughing and screaming.
C: CHARLIE
D: Ew! That's disgusting!
C: PATRICK
D: Yes! It is! Let's keep the train rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie!
N: Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks...
C: CHARLIE
D: Uh. Well... there was this girl named Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the 4th grade--
C: PATRICK
D: Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.
C: CHARLIE
D: And she let some of the boys feel them.
C: PATRICK
D: That's your suburban legend? Did you at least cop a feel?
C: CHARLIE
D: No.
C: PATRICK
D: Of course not. You went home, listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self- esteem--
C: CHARLIE
D: Fine! Okay. Your turn.
N: Patrick walks over and sits down next to Charlie.
C: PATRICK
D: Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill. Guy's father didn't know about his son. So, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town. Catches his son with another boy. So, he starts beating him. But not like the slap kind. Like the real kind. And the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're killing him." And the son just yells "Get out." And eventually the boyfriend just did.
N: Patrick stops. Gripped by sad. He can't shake.
C: PATRICK
D: Why can't you save anybody?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't know.
C: PATRICK
D: Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could meet the love of my life any second now. Things will be different now, and that's good. I just need to meet a good guy.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah.
N: Patrick looks at him. Charlie has never seen him so vulnerable. After a beat... Patrick kisses Charlie on the mouth. Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen. His eyes open the whole time. A moment, then Patrick looks at Charlie. He collapses into his chest.
C: PATRICK
D: I'm sorry.
C: CHARLIE
D: It's alright.
N: Charlie holds his friend as Patrick begins to cry. And we leave them, the city lights small in the distance.
S: EXT. CITY HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: We see the truck glide down the highway.
C: CHARLIE
D: I've been spending a lot of time with Patrick. He begins every night really excited.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SCHENLEY PARK - NIGHT
N: Patrick and Charlie are parked at the entrance of Schenley Park. Patrick speaks, very animated, until...

E: V.O.
N: ... the words leave him, and we can see how sad he really is.

C: BILL
D: Well, my wife and I like it here, and I think I might be better at teaching than writing.
N: Charlie is relieved. Bill is staying.
C: BILL
D: So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I could still give you books next year.

S: INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

C: SAM
D: Are these all your books, Charlie?
N: He nods. They lock eyes and do not speak.
S: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The pictures are down. The dressers empty. The suitcase is open on the bed. Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put them in her suitcase. He has promised himself he will not cry. Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of "Something." Instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail. Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice.
C: SAM
D: Thanks for staying up with me.
C: CHARLIE
D: Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition.
C: SAM
D: That sounds like fun.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore.
C: SAM
D: Yes, I will.
N: Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room. They stand next to each other. Close.
C: SAM
D: I had lunch with Craig today.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah?
C: SAM
D: He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him. But I'm driving away, and I just felt so small. Just asking myself why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?
C: CHARLIE
D: We accept the love we think we deserve.
N: He says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in. Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she turns to him.
C: SAM
D: Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?
N: Charlie didn't expect that. He is silent. Heart pounding.
C: CHARLIE
D: I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that.
C: SAM
D: Well, what did you want?
C: CHARLIE
D: I just want you to be happy.
C: SAM
D: Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel that. It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me.
C: CHARLIE
D: I know who you are, Sam.
N: Sam waits. And Charlie finally speaks from the heart.
C: CHARLIE
D: I know I'm quiet, and I know I should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. How much we are alike. And how we've been through the same things. And you're not small. You're beautiful.
E: CONT'D
N: He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing. We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water.
C: SAM
D: What's wrong, Charlie?
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, ah... nothing.
N: Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues
S: EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: It's like a dream for Charlie. He watches Sam hug Alice and Mary Elizabeth goodbye. But Charlie is somewhere else.
C: SAM
D: I'll call all the time.
C: MARY ELIZABETH
D: Promise.
C: SAM
D: And we'll all see each other in New York.
C: SAM'S MOM
D: Come on, Sam.
N: Charlie can't take it. He moves to the side of the truck and puts in the last suitcase. He looks over at Sam.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers kissing Sam the night before. Her hand touches Charlie's knee. BACK TO PRESENT:
S: EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Charlie snaps himself out of it. He turns back as Mary Elizabeth and Alice part ways. Charlie locks eyes with Sam. They take a moment. And then they come together to hug. She kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry. After a moment, Sam climbs into the driver's seat of her truck with Patrick riding shotgun. Charlie looks dazed.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers pulling away from Sam. Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost.
C: SAM
D: What's wrong, Charlie?
N: BACK TO PRESENT:
S: EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Sam starts the truck. Charlie wants to scream for her to stop. But he's frozen. She drives away. He watches her go. The truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the stop sign. And disappears. Charlie stands there, alone.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers the night with Sam. We see her put her hand on his knee. The image moves up the arm. To the shoulder. To the face. And we reveal, we are not in Sam's bedroom. And it is not Sam touching Charlie. But... Aunt Helen
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Don't wake your sister.
N: BACK TO REALITY:
S: EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: The memory only registers as a small blink of his eye. Charlie sees his friends are crying. He's not. He's numb.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
N: Charlie walks down the street. His eyes far away. The images and memories are short, violent bursts. If you've never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels.
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: QUICK FLASH. It's Christmas Eve. Aunt Helen smiles to Little Charlie.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: It'll be our little secret, okay?
N: Little Charlie nods.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING (PRESENT)
N: BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie walks toward us on the sidewalk. We see him through a long lens. His image fractures. We see him in different planes of the image. He's beginning to break apart. One image. Two images.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: QUICK FLASH. Little Candace is asleep on the floor. Aunt Helen sits next to Little Charlie on the sofa.
C: AUNT HELEN
D: Look, Charlie. She's fast asleep.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING (PRESENT)

S: INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
N: QUICK FLASH. Little Charlie's mom opens the door to reveal a policeman.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)
N: BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie is in the same entry hall in the same house 8 years later. Banging his head against the wall. "It's my fault. It's all my fault." He passes the photo wall on the stairs. We see the images of the family. Church. Communion. Baby pictures. Years of history staring at us. Ghosts on the wall.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)
N: BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie sits at his desk. We see him from behind. Perfectly still. Trying to keep himself calm.
C: CHARLIE
D: Stop crying.
S: INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY (FLASHBACK)
N: QUICK FLASH. Charlie thinks everyone is staring at him. His sister and her friends. His brother and mother. Mary Elizabeth and Alice. And worst of all... Sam and Patrick the night they toasted him. A paranoid nightmare.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)
N: BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie's falling to pieces. The tears run down his face.
C: CHARLIE
D: Stop crying.
S: INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - VARIOUS TIMES (FANTASY)
N: QUICK FLASH. Derek hits Candace. Patrick hits Brad. The cafeteria erupts into violence. And Charlie remembers what he's blacked out. We see him in the cafeteria. Terrifying. He thinks he sees Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose. Hits another in the throat. And pushes another. Charlie looks at his hand, covered in blood. The whole school staring at him.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)
N: BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie holds his head. Trying to stuff the pictures back in his brain. But he can't. They keep coming and coming, faster and faster. Sam's hand, Little Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt Helen is dead.
C: CHARLIE
D: It'll be our little secret.
E: V.O.
N: We go behind his head. The image moves closer and closer. Until it feels like we are inside Charlie's mind.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOUSE SWIMMING POOL - DAY
N: We see Candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friend's backyard pool. Her FRIEND (18, pretty) holds the cordless.
C: CANDACE'S FRIEND
D: Candace... your brother's on the phone.
N: Candace casually picks up the phone.
C: CANDACE
D: Hello.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey, Candace.
E: V.O.
C: CANDACE
D: Charlie?
C: CHARLIE
D: Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something.
C: CANDACE
D: What?
C: CHARLIE
D: Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over.
N: Candace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone.
C: CANDACE
D: Call the police and send them to my house.
C: CHARLIE
D: And I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.
C: CANDACE
D: No, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad are going to be home with Chris any second.
C: CHARLIE
D: I was just thinking... what if I wanted her to die, Candace?
C: CANDACE
D: What? Charlie... Charlie!
N: Dial tone.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY
N: We begin in the house. It's silent. The hallway. The entry hall. The empty bedroom. Charlie's typewriter on his desk. It's all so quiet. And then, we see Charlie walking down the hallway. He turns the corner and enters the...
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - DAY (PAST AND PRESENT)
N: Kitchen. One room. Charlie doesn't know where he is anymore. The past and present have bled together. QUICK FLASH. We see Little Charlie turn the corner into the kitchen. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie stands in the same kitchen, breathing shallow. QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie walks up to Aunt Helen sitting at the kitchen table. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack. QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and turns it over... to reveal her wrist scars. BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie looks from the table to the counter with the bread and the KNIVES. He stares at the knives for a moment. Just as... The Policemen break down the door.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: We see Charlie's reflection in the window. The door opens slowly, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Burton, enters. She finds him sitting in the corner. He has been crying.
C: DR. BURTON
D: Charlie? I'm Dr. Burton.
C: CHARLIE
D: Where am I?
C: DR. BURTON
D: Mayview hospital.
N: This news hits Charlie hard. He begins to panic.
C: CHARLIE
D: You have to let me go. My dad can't afford it.
C: DR. BURTON
D: Don't worry about that.
C: CHARLIE
D: No. I saw them when I was little. And I don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just tell me how to stop it.
C: DR. BURTON
D: Stop what?
C: CHARLIE
D: Seeing it. All their lives. All the time. Just... how do you stop seeing it?
C: DR. BURTON
D: Seeing what, Charlie?
N: Charlie breaks.
C: CHARLIE
D: There is so much pain. And I don't know how to not notice it.
C: DR. BURTON
D: What's hurting you?
C: CHARLIE
D: No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone. It never stops. Do you understand?
N: Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic. Charlie nods, relieved that someone finally understands. Until...
C: DR. BURTON
D: What about your Aunt Helen?
N: Like cold water. What was tears is now confusion and soon to be shame. Dr. Burton is gentle to him.
C: CHARLIE
D: What about her?
C: DR. BURTON
D: Can you see her?
C: CHARLIE
D: Yes, she had a terrible life. But... I mean, what am I...
C: DR. BURTON
D: You said some things about her in your sleep.
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't care.
C: DR. BURTON
D: If you want to get better, you have to--
N: Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.
C: CHARLIE
D: She was... insane.
N: The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today.
C: DR. BURTON
D: Charlie, are you going to let me help you here?
N: Charlie cries and nods.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay.
C: DR. BURTON
D: Do you remember anything before you blacked out?
C: CHARLIE
D: I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home...
N: We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
N: The sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks at Sam's typewriter. "Dear Friend" is already typed.
C: CHARLIE
D: I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't go into detail about all of it. But I will say there were some very bad days. And some unexpected beautiful days.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
N: Dr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway.
C: CHARLIE
D: The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me.
E: V.O.
N: In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop. Shocked.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
N: Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway.
C: MOTHER
D: Honey?
N: His mother comes to hold him.
C: MOTHER
D: I'm so sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page, before he chokes it down. He walks over to his son and kisses his forehead.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
N: Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards.
C: CHARLIE
D: The best days were those when I could have visitors. My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
N: Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand. His mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton.
C: DR. BURTON
D: There he is. So, I'll see you Thursday at 6, right?
N: Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.
C: CHARLIE
D: My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together.
E: V.O.
N: Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The family sits at the dinner table.
C: FATHER
D: God bless this food that we are about to receive. We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
N: After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until...
C: CHARLIE
D: How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad?
C: FATHER
D: God damn Penguins. I think they're allergic to God damn defense.
C: CHARLIE
D: What do the players call a puck again?
C: FATHER
D: A biscuit.
C: CANDACE
D: Are you sure it's not a "God damn biscuit?"
C: FATHER
D: You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
N: As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper. Candace talks about the books she'll need for college. Everyone starts eating. And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK
N: Ding dong. The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling.
C: PATRICK
D: Can Charlie come out and play?
N: Charlie's mother smiles. Charlie smiles, too. Especially when he sees... Sam. Standing next to Patrick. Her hair a little different. Her eyes alive and happy.
S: INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The gang of three sit at their booth. Sam and Patrick have their coffee. Charlie has his brownie. Like always.
C: SAM
D: That first night, I had grilled stickies. It was so good. You have to visit in the Fall. We'll have some. Okay?
C: CHARLIE
D: Definitely.
C: PATRICK
D: Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October.
N: Charlie laughs. Sam smiles. After a beat...
C: SAM
D: Well, can I tell you something? I've been away for two months. It's another world. And it gets better. And my roommate Katie has the best taste in music.
E: off Charlie's smile
N: Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table.
C: SAM
D: I found the tunnel song.
E: CONT'D
N: Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile.
C: SAM
D: Let's drive.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck. Patrick drives. Charlie in the middle. Sam the passenger.
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So, if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school. And you helped me.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT
N: The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck. The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance.
C: CHARLIE
D: Even if you didn't know what I was talking about. Or know someone who's gone through it. It made me not feel alone.
E: V.O.
N: With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window
S: EXT. HIGHWAY 376 NORTH - NIGHT
N: Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down, looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been.
C: CHARLIE
D: Because I know there are people who say all of these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.
E: V.O.
N: We see Charlie in profile. The night sky behind him until...
S: INT. FORT PITT TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: ... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying.
C: CHARLIE
D: I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now, these moments are not stories.
E: V.O.
N: Charlie turns to face forward. To the moment. To Sam, smiling at him from the front seat.
C: CHARLIE
D: This is happening. I am here. And I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful.
E: V.O CONT'D
N: Sam kisses Charlie. Then, she turns, and all three kids look ahead to everything in front of them. Charlie begins to stand in the back of the truck. Ready to leave the tunnel.
C: CHARLIE
D: I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive. And as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Charlie stands in the back of the truck. The wind on his face. He is free.
C: CHARLIE
D: And in this moment, I swear...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: We see the moment as Charlie sees it. The tunnel's exit getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city behind it.
C: CHARLIE
D: ... we are infinite.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel. Sam and Patrick scream with excitement. Charlie holds his arms in the air. The weight of the world gone. If only for a moment. This one moment. We see the city. A million lights like white stars in a glass dome. We crane to the sky. We are in Heaven.
T: FADE OUT.
