C: MIRANDA
D: I just want to make sure you're being smart here --
C: CARRIE
D: And I love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel. Jealous.

C: CARRIE
D: Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.
E: CONT'D

C: SAMANTHA

C: MIRANDA
D: Great. Can't wait.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Don't you ever get weirded out by seeing Smith in bed with all those other women?
C: SAMANTHA
D: No, I think it's hot. Sometimes, when I'm alone, I masturbate right along with them.
C: CARRIE
D: And people say the golden age of television is over.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Besides, it's fake sex. When they're doing it -- no one's actually turned on.
C: MIRANDA
D: Kinda like Steve and I.
N: Miranda laughs. Everyone looks.
C: MIRANDA
D: I'm kidding. But come one-- it's been seven years. He does that, I do this... It's not like a new plot twist is going to turn up.
E: CONT'D Beat; then

N: Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are primping in front of the mirror.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I thought this auction would be more fun... but it's kinda sad.
N: A BABY VOICED WOMAN (45) next to Charlotte overhears.
C: BABY VOICED WOMAN
D: Isn't it?
N: They look over at her.
C: BABY VOICED WOMAN
D: I thought it was just sad for me `cause I know her. But it's really sad, huh? And it's funny cause they were so happy.
E: CONT'D
C: SAMANTHA
D: ... Till they weren't
C: BABY VOICED WOMAN
D: I know, right? We all told her to get married -- but she didn't want to push him. He'd been married three other times. So, she let it ride and then she came home one night and he had locked her out. She didn't even have anywhere to live. After ten years. Such a shame. She was a smart girl till she fell in love.
N: Carrie catches Miranda's eye in the mirror, looks away.
S: INT. BIG'S SUBLET/KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SUMMER
N: Big takes a bright red lobster out of a pot of hot water with tongs. He places it next to another cooked lobster. He walks to the cooking island where Carrie sits; sipping wine.

C: CARRIE
D: I'm not sitting, I'm thinking.
C: BIG
D: Here. Husk and think.

C: CARRIE
D: I'm thinking I'm going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on Fifth.
C: BIG
D: Why? You love your place.
C: CARRIE
D: I know but --
C: BIG
D: But what?
C: CARRIE
D: We're together ever night -- so I'm basically paying a mortgage on a glorified closet.
C: BIG
D: You write there. It's your office.
C: CARRIE
D: There's plenty of room at the new place and -- besides.. I want to make us -- a life there. I want it to be ours.
C: BIG
D: It is ours. I bought it for us.
C: CARRIE
D: And that's so amazing --but you bought it, so it's really your place. And -- if anything were to happen...
C: BIG
D: What's going to happen?
C: CARRIE
D: I have to be smart here. I mean, we're not married and I'd have no legal rights to... this home that I built... with you.
N: Silence. He thinks. Chops. She husks.
C: BIG
D: Did you want to get married?
C: CARRIE
D: I didn't think it was an option.
C: BIG
D: Well, Mr. Bradshaw, what if it was an option?
N: She hits him with a husk. He smiles.
C: CARRIE
D: Well, people are always assuming we are.
C: BIG
D: And you know what happens when people assume. They make an ass out of who?
C: CARRIE
D: You and me.
N: He smiles. She smiles. Chop. Chop.
C: BIG
D: What do you think, kid?
C: CARRIE
D: Why -- Do you want to get married?
C: BIG

E: Beat; then
N: 16A.
C: BIG
D: Deal.
N: He puts out his hand. She takes it and they shake.
C: BIG
D: But... You gotta do better on that corn. Look at all the stuff left on there.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks down at her corn, he's right. She nods.
S: INT. MODERN RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SUMMER

C: CARRIE
D: No. I did not get Botox
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll love it.
C: CARRIE
D: I did not call to talk about Botox.
C: SAMANTHA
D: I'm just saying.
N: Samantha reaches the top of the stairs. Blow-ups of Smith on various magazine covers line the walls of the chic, small office space.
C: CARRIE
D: So... Last week, after the auction, I started thinking about my options.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Right.
C: CARRIE
D: Right, and... well, Big and I decided to get married.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Really?
C: CARRIE

C: CARRIE

C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, honey -- I am excited for you but -- you know me... I don't really believe in marriage.... Botox on the other hand -- That works every time.

C: SAMANTHA
D: And I guess, I thought that after that big mess with Aidan -- you'd never want to get married.
C: CARRIE
D: I know.
N: 19A.
C: SAMANTHA
D: So, I put you in my "we're never getting married" file. Now, I've got to take you out of that file.
C: CARRIE
D: Sorry about the extra paper work.
C: SAMANTHA
D: You'll get my bill.
C: CARRIE
D: Samantha, it feels so different this time. No cliché romantic kneeling down on one knee. Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together.
C: SAMANTHA
D: Well, I'm happy for you.
C: CARRIE
D: And one more thing... I want you to be maid of honor. How do you feel about that?

C: CHARLOTTE
D: I'm so excited!
C: CARRIE
D: Here it is.
E: V.O.

E: CONT'D
C: CHARLOTTE
D: No, it's pretty but it's so -- simple.
C: CARRIE
D: Simple and classic. When I saw it I just thought: That is what I should marry Big in.

N: Brady nods. Magda walks away with Brady. Miranda is packing up Brady's action figures. Steve gives her a look.
C: MIRANDA
D: What? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. Brady woke me up at five AM.
C: STEVE

C: STEVE
D: What now?
E: CONT'D

And then - - we had to pick a place to meet -- and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists. Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward.
C: CARRIE
D: Can you do that?
C: MIRANDA
D: I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do.
C: CARRIE
D: Thinking -- or feeling?
C: MIRANDA
D: What do you mean?
C: CARRIE
D: Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical. It's emotional. Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions.
C: MIRANDA
D: Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel.
C: CARRIE
D: You will. There will come a moment when you'll know. And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window... with the past.
C: MIRANDA
D: And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.
C: CARRIE
D: Where is it?
C: MIRANDA
D: The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway between both our places.

C: SAMANTHA
D: I've been avoiding mirrors.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I'm proud of you for not cheating.

D: I don't know if there's anything to be proud of. I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.
N: Carrie reaches over and rubs Samantha's back.
C: CARRIE
D: Why didn't you say something?
C: SAMANTHA
D: I guess I didn't want to admit it. And when you're in denial -- you don't dial.
C: CARRIE
D: Now, listen -- this isn't about the weight. You'd be gorgeous at any size. But are you happy?

At the front of the line four TWENTY-SOMETHING WOMEN stand waiting for the red rope to be lifted. As the CAMERA moves past them and UP -- the Doorman lifts the red rope and the twenty-something women SQUEAL with excitement and anticipation as they hurry inside. The CAMERA continues UP and UP and over the busy and exciting city.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
