N: THE OPENING MUZAK STRAINS OF A "KARAOKE SONG TO BE DETERMINED"
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and, * oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny KARAOKE STAGE in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar. Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. At a table near the stage is -- -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but * handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with -- -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's -- * who sings along with -- -- the small but energetic CROWD. Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the Queen of Karaoke. LATER Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join Charlie and Owen.
C: CHARLIE
D: That was so good, baby!
C: KATE
D: Bullshit.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel.
N: Owen and Kate LAUGH.
C: KATE
D: If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say?
C: CHARLIE
D: I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive.
C: KATE
D: That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it.
N: Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at Owen and makes a puppy dog face.
C: KATE
D: Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen.
E: CONT'D to Owen
C: OWEN
D: Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell.
N: Owen motions to the -- -- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's. *
C: KATE
D: She's hot! What can't you tell?
C: OWEN
D: She looks like she could kick my ass. No way would she go for a guy like me.
C: KATE
D: You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her.
C: OWEN
D: I don't know...forget about it.
E: clearly shy
C: KATE
D: I'll take point -- follow me.
E: not going to take "no" for an answer
N: Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.
C: KATE
D: I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week.
E: CONT'D
C: FEMALE BARTENDER
D: `Kay.
N: The bartender quickly pours the drinks.
C: FEMALE BARTENDER
D: That's fifteen.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him?
N: The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she listens.
C: FEMALE BARTENDER
D: What happened?
E: unenthused
C: KATE
D: He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer! * And she dumped him.
E: sad
N: The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation to hear her response, which is --
C: FEMALE BARTENDER
D: You kickbox?
E: to Owen
C: OWEN
D: Yeah.
E: caught in the headlights
N: And...that's all Owen's got.
C: KATE
D: And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute!
E: jumping in
N: The bartender glances back to Owen.
C: OWEN
D: A lot of `em don't have parents -- so...it's kinda more than just a teacher/student thing. I know it sounds silly, but I feel responsible for them -- like... ...I could be their parent.
E: finally beat emotional
N: Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.
C: KATE
D: I think I got him laid.
E: hushed
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah?
C: KATE
D: She seems totally game.
C: CHARLIE
D: Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants?
N: Kate rolls her eyes.
C: KATE
D: I think I'm done for the night.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah?
N: Owen wanders over, dejected. *
C: OWEN
D: She's seen "Say Anything."
C: CHARLIE
D: Eh, well...what're you gonna do, huh? Wanna drive us home?
E: beat
C: KATE
D: No -- he needs to keep working it! * You guys stay here.
C: CHARLIE
D: I don't want to watch my brother not score. I want to go to bed with you and... ...you know.
E: whispered into Kate's ear
C: KATE
D: I'll be home when you get there. We can "you know" then.
C: OWEN
D: Yeah, man -- you don't have a job to wake up for in the morning or anything.
E: to Charlie
C: CHARLIE
D: Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work harder. Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive.
E: to Kate
C: KATE
D: So's Owen. I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up.
E: suddenly focused
C: CHARLIE
D: Tell that to the cops.
N: Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.
C: KATE
D: I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women.
E: to Charlie
N: Beat.
C: CHARLIE
D: That sounds like two missions.
C: KATE
D: No, it's just one.
C: CHARLIE
D: It kinda sounded like two, right?
E: to Owen
C: OWEN
D: It did.
E: nodding
N: Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.
C: KATE
D: GoodbyeIloveyouboth!
E: really fast
S: 2 EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 2 *
N: Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances over and sees: A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS again. Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and Freda.
C: KATE
D: You okay?
C: FREDA
D: Yeah. Are you?
E: quick
C: KATE
D: Um...sure.
E: taken aback
C: FREDA
D: Good. Hey, I'm not really okay.
E: whispers
C: KATE
D: Oh...
C: FREDA
D: My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here.
C: KATE
D: I guess I could...
C: FREDA
D: You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you!
N: Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over. *
C: KATE
D: I was gonna say "call you a cab," `cause, you know -- I don't even know you.
C: FREDA
D: It's not far. Please? Pretty please...?
N: Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.
T: CUT TO:
S: 3 INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT 3 *
N: The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown. * Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances down at the floor and notices a FLASK. *
C: FREDA
D: You know, you shouldn't drink and drive.
C: KATE
D: I wasn't --
C: FREDA
D: Just kidding. Can I have a sip?
N: Kate's speechless.
C: FREDA
D: I'm really thirsty.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: It's, uh...whiskey.
C: FREDA
D: Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love whiskey. You're the real thing, huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like me!
N: Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask.
C: KATE
D: I don't know. No.
C: FREDA
D: Can I smoke in your car?
C: KATE
D: Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?
E: slightly annoyed
C: FREDA
D: Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.
N: Freda takes out a -- -- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.
C: KATE
D: WHOA!
E: in disbelief
N: Kate immediately pulls the car over.
C: KATE
D: Not what I thought you meant.
E: CONT'D
C: FREDA
D: Want a hit?
C: KATE
D: No, I...is that pot?
C: FREDA
D: Of course not! What do I look like? A stoner?
E: as though it's a ridiculous question MORE
C: FREDA
D: It's crack.
E: CONT'D beat
C: KATE
D: Oh, shit! No...no thank you.
C: FREDA
D: C'mon -- it's good crack.
C: KATE
D: I don't, um...I've never smoked crack.
C: FREDA
D: Really? This stuff is the truth -- and it'll sober you up.
E: surprised
C: KATE
D: Uh...I think you should go.
C: FREDA
D: I'm not getting out in the middle of nowhere. Do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at * night?
C: KATE
D: I don't know -- people might offer you crack?
C: FREDA
D: Seriously? It's not a big deal -- just take a little hit.
N: Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.
C: KATE
D: I said no.
C: FREDA
D: One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober you up.
N: Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of her.
C: FREDA
D: Smoke me!
E: CONT'D high-pitched cartoon voice
N: Kate LAUGHS.
C: KATE
D: One puff. Then we are both going home.
N: Freda nods. Long beat.
C: KATE
D: Fine.
E: CONT'D
N: Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.
C: FREDA
D: You've got money, right?
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - NIGHT
N: Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS -- -- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass around TWO PIPES. LATER Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk. Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're still smoking crack.
C: KATE
D: ...'cause I feel like I understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? I mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "There's some upper-middle-class, NPR listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. Probably never had to worry about anything." But that's not true at all! I grew up poor, man. Single mother. McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week.
E: mile-a-minute fast MORE
C: KATE
D: I was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. Eating used to be my thing. When I started drinking, though, I kinda stopped eating so much. But anyway, the point is: You and me, we're not so different.
E: CONT'D back on track
N: The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate. They're more concerned with their crack pipe.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN

S: INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN
N: Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down at -- -- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls. She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland * Park. *

C: CHARLIE
D: Huh?!
E: confused
C: KATE
D: Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep.
C: CHARLIE
D: What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited.
C: KATE

C: CHARLIE

C: KATE
D: I ended up...
N: Charlie SNIFFS Kate.
C: CHARLIE
D: You smell funny. What do you smell like?
C: KATE
D: I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive.
C: CHARLIE
D: So, why didn't you come back or call me?
C: KATE
D: Charlie -- -- I'm fine.
E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes.
C: KATE
D: I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work.
C: CHARLIE
D: I can't be worried about you all the time.
N: Kate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead.
C: KATE
D: Don't worry so much. I'm fine. C'mon -- let me get you to bed.
E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm up now -- how `bout I make us bacon and egg sandwiches?

C: CHARLIE
D: Check for your mom's on the table.
C: KATE
D: Thanks, baby.
N: Kate takes a sip of coffee.
C: KATE
D: Why does the coffee taste so much better when you make it?

A FEW MOMENTS LATER Kate chugs what's left in the flask. ACROSS THE PARKING LOT * MR. DAVIES -- the assistant principal, early-40's, slightly * nerdy but not bad looking, watches -- * -- Kate drink in her car. * CHILDREN pass by in the distance. * Mr. Davies takes a beat, but instead of saying anything he * walks away through the parking lot. * Kate doesn't notice she's been seen. * 13 OMITTED 13 *
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Kate stands next to a CHALKBOARD in front of a class of THIRD GRADERS. She's really animated -- doing her "game show hostess" schtick. On the chalkboard are the letters: "AN"
C: KATE
D: Now, if I add a "C," what word do I have?
E: to the class
N: A STUDENT raises her hand.
C: KATE
D: Yes, Hillary? *
E: CONT'D
N: HILLARY * Can?
C: KATE
D: That's correct! Can. You've won an all-expenses paid trip to the blackboard, Hillary! *

N: Hillary shuffles up to the board and writes "CAN." *
C: KATE
D: Great job, Hillary -- let's give * her a round of applause!

C: KATE
D: P...okay, what word would that make if I added a "P"?
C: RAMON
D: Um...pan?
C: KATE
D: Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN!
N: Ramon walks up and begins to write "PAN."
C: KATE
D: Wow! Just look at that excellent penman --
E: CONT'D
N: Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely -- -- VOMITS on the floor! Ramon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks horrified. Kate glances up from behind her desk to see -- -- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like --
C: KIDS
D: EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! SHRIMP! BACON!

E: to the class
N: HILLARY stands up. * HILLARY * Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant?

D: Yes.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: Vice Principal Davies will be looking after your students for the rest of the day -- so you don't need to worry about that.
C: KATE
D: Oh, that's really good to know. I'll have to thank him. I just feel awful for getting sick in front of my students.
E: beat

C: KATE
D: Huh?
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: The pregnancy, I mean.
N: Kate's not sure how to respond.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES

E: CONT'D
N: Principal Barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then catches herself and quickly shifts gears.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: ...I mean, it's like I've got a couple hundred kids here -- -- but...I don't fool myself. It's not the same.
E: CONT'D forces a laugh
C: KATE
D: Well...it's hard to explain.
E: considers her reply

C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: Of course.
C: KATE
D: Like...a lot.
N: Principal Barnes gets up and kneels next to Kate. She places her hand on Kate's belly and closes her eyes.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: Hello in there. Can you hear me? You're a tiny miracle. Did you know that? A miracle.
E: whispers
N: Principal Barnes looks up at Kate and smiles -- with tears in her eyes.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her classroom. Through the glass she sees -- -- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned smile you give someone right after they've publicly embarrassed themselves). Kate mouths the words --
C: KATE
D: Thank you.
E: silent
N: -- and gestures "come here." Mr. Davies gestures to the class that he'll be right back -- before he walks out to talk to Kate. He's got a slightly nervous demeanor -- somewhere between "I never became comfortable talking to women" and Asperger's.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Is everything, um...okay, Mrs. Hannah?
C: KATE
D: Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you.

D: I know that! Oh, God, I... ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant.
E: long beat
C: MR. DAVIES
D: What?
C: KATE
D: I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Oh. That's...not good.
C: KATE
D: I know. I...please don't say anything.
N: Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Just...go home. Get some sleep.
N: Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the classroom.

S: 18 INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - DAY 18 *
N: Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER. It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not?

N: Kate takes a long sip of beer.
C: KATE
D: I told my class I was pregnant.
N: Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over and grabs her hand.

E: long beat
N: A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's face.
C: CHARLIE
D: What do you mean?
C: KATE
D: I dunno. I think I might...drink too much.
N: Charlie LAUGHS.
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.
N: Charlie swigs his beer.
C: KATE
D: I know I do -- I'm a fucking mess...
C: CHARLIE
D: Baby -- that's not true. You're beautiful. And brilliant. And I love you. I wouldn't be married to a "mess."
C: KATE
D: I left work after puking in front * of little kids. And...now I'm * drinking in the middle of the day. *
C: CHARLIE
D: Well, those things happen sometimes. I mean, they shouldn't happen all the time, but...it's the price of, uh, truly living life.
E: beat
C: KATE
D: Isn't that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something...?
C: CHARLIE
D: No. And it's true -- you and me, we're not just some boring couple in the suburbs who don't sleep with each other and have nothing to talk about except whatever TV show they're currently into. We, like...still know how to party.
E: beat
C: KATE
D: Yeah... ...I think I need to slow down. And I might need help.
E: beat beat
C: CHARLIE
D: I'll help you.
C: KATE
D: I know, but...I might need more help.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah? Like a therapist?
C: KATE
D: I don't know -- I just get stupid when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a lot.
C: CHARLIE
D: We just like to have a good time.
C: KATE
D: Yeah, well... ...you've gotta promise not to tell this to anyone.
E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: I promise.
E: curious

D: Of course.
C: KATE
D: Well, last night I kinda, um... ...smoked some crack.
E: hushed
C: CHARLIE
D: WHAT?!
N: Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie.
C: KATE
D: After I left the bar, I, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...I don't really remember what came next, but I ended up smoking crack with her.
C: CHARLIE
D: Uh...how's that even happen? You give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack?!
E: confused beat
C: KATE
D: Well...she seemed desperate. She really needed a ride home.
C: CHARLIE
D: Where?
C: KATE
D: Downtown. I think she maybe lives in...a tent?
C: CHARLIE
D: What?
C: KATE
D: Well...she might be homeless. Or a prostitute. Or just some lost sorority girl. To be honest, I'm not sure...
E: thinks about it
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, my god...you smoked crack with some random stranger? Did you...share a pipe?
E: disgusted
N: Kate doesn't answer. She doesn't need to.
C: CHARLIE
D: Ughhh... Just playing Devil's advocate, but maybe it's the crack-smoking you need help with and not the drinking.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Kate gives Charlie a dirty look.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm just saying.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: The drinking led to the crack- smoking. The drinking leads to everything stupid I do. I mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex?
E: beat
N: Charlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. He tries to remember. And can't.
C: CHARLIE
D: We'll chill out with the booze for a while. We can just be wine-with- * dinner people. How's that sound?
E: beat
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Kate and Charlie joyfully ride BICYCLES home from the bar.
C: CHARLIE
D: Maybe you should go to, uh... one of those meetings. They have `em over there.
N: Charlie gestures to a BUILDING (could be a church or different type of building where AA meets). Kate LAUGHS.
C: KATE
D: Yeah, right.
C: CHARLIE
D: Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there?
C: KATE
D: Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to like every question and at the end it was like, "If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!"
E: laughs
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah... ...that was fun, wasn't it?
E: nostalgic
N: Kate smiles and nods.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey --
E: CONT'D
N: Charlie gestures to the street.
C: CHARLIE
D: -- look out for that crack!
E: CONT'D
N: Kate looks down but sees nothing.
C: KATE
D: What crack?
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there... ...but you must have smoked it last night.
E: grins
N: Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away. Kate chases after him.
S: INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: While an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS -- -- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and * LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.
C: CHARLIE
D: "Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?"
C: KATE
D: Absolutely.
C: CHARLIE
D: "Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?"
C: KATE
D: Envy isn't exactly the right word...
C: CHARLIE
D: "Do you have `blackouts'?"
C: KATE
D: Yeah, but who doesn't?
C: CHARLIE
D: "Has your drinking caused trouble at home?"
C: KATE
D: No! We're great.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of "yes" answers. Yep...we still qualify as drunks.
E: refers to pamphlet
C: KATE
D: I'm gonna go!
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, right.
E: disbelief
C: KATE
D: No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it?

C: KATE
D: This is me: going.
E: quite serious
N: Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it.
C: CHARLIE
D: You've been boozing.
C: KATE
D: So? You should come too!
N: Charlie LAUGHS.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something.
C: KATE
D: Oh, yeah? Watch me!
S: INT. MEETING HALL - NIGHT
N: An AA meeting is in progress. An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story. The room is filled with -- -- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their "own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people are adults. There are distinct groups of -- -- "PRETTY WOMEN" -- -- "OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE" -- -- "BUSINESSMEN" -- -- and "HIPSTERS." As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his hand.
C: DONOVAN
D: Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.
E: whispers
C: KATE
D: Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!
N: Donovan "shushes" Kate.
C: DONOVAN
D: You must be a newcomer, huh?
C: KATE
D: A what?
C: DONOVAN
D: Um, I'm not really allowed to talk to new chicks, but there are lots of women here who can help you out.
E: whispers
C: KATE
D: Okay. Do I just sit wherever?
E: confused beat
C: DONOVAN
D: The meeting already started so just try to find a spot anywhere.
N: Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN. As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next to Kate quietly try to welcome her. LILY * Are you new?
C: KATE
D: To this? Yeah. Why's everyone whispering?
N: SHANA * It's hard, huh?
C: KATE
D: I guess.
N: LILY * Everything's going to be fine. You're home. Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally joined Jim Jones' church. LATER The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE. The tattooed man stands at the podium.
C: TATTOO MAN
D: Not to embarrass anyone, but so that we may get to know you better - - is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery?
N: Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and introduce themselves as alcoholics. Kate stands up.
C: KATE
D: I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a little drunk right now.
N: People burst into LAUGHTER.
C: KATE
D: Do you want me to talk about my childhood or something?
E: CONT'D
C: TATTOO MAN
D: You know, Kate, we actually ask that you don't share if you've had * a drink or any mind-altering substance in the past 24 hours.
E: painfully polite
C: KATE
D: I can -- I kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. And my mom...oh, man...I don't even know where to start. She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and --
E: not listening
C: TATTOO MAN
D: Welcome, Kate. It gets better.
E: tries to shut Kate up forces a smile
C: KATE
D: I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything...
E: not picking up the hint
N: Kate nervously LAUGHS. Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.
C: TATTOO MAN
D: Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though.
N: The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down. LILY * Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story. A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.
C: AMBER
D: Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy...
C: KATE
D: How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars? How old are you, Amber?
E: way too loud to Amber
N: SHANA * Be respectful. Kate seems surprised at being chastised.
C: AMBER
D: Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday!
E: gaining intensity
C: KATE
D: Everyday?
C: AMBER
D: It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course!
N: The whole room APPLAUDS. LATER Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY PRAYER.
C: EVERYONE
D: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference.
C: KATE
D: AMEN!
N: Everyone turns and looks at Kate.
C: KATE
D: Okay...I think I'm good.
E: CONT'D embarrassed
N: Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived.
S: EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.
C: KATE
D: So much for that.
N: Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss- crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN FURNITURE. They drunkenly play CROQUET. *
C: CHARLIE
D: Was it a bunch of old biker guys?
C: KATE
D: No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!
C: CHARLIE
D: Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool.
N: Charlie thinks for a moment.
C: CHARLIE

E: CONT'D beat
N: Kate nods in agreement. *
C: CHARLIE

E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world.
E: sincere
N: Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment, and then Kate... ...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate grins mischievously.
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, no you didn't!
E: CONT'D
N: Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too intense.
S: INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and voice).
C: CHARLIE
D: Are you trying to have some sex?
N: Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She climbs on top of him and -- -- they start having sloppy, drunk sex. After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving. She looks down to discover that -- -- he's passed out. Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her unconscious husband.
S: INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there isn't more alcohol in the house. A FEW MOMENTS LATER Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her robe and slippers).
S: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
N: Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf. Kate sets the bottles on the counter. * The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate with pity.
C: CLERK
D: You know I can't sell you this, Kate.
N: An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at Kate. *
C: KATE
D: What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me.
C: CLERK
D: Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're old enough -- but it's too late.
N: The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45).
C: KATE
D: C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two...
N: Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch.
C: CLERK
D: Stop it.
E: not amused
C: KATE
D: It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything.
C: CLERK
D: I don't think so. Sorry.
N: Kate gives him a big, flirty smile.
C: KATE
D: Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want.
N: Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance.
C: CLERK
D: It's the law. I can't sell alcohol after 2 a.m. You know that.
C: KATE
D: Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends.
C: CLERK
D: I could lose my job.
N: Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at the Elderly Man in the frozen food section. *
C: KATE
D: You distract him, okay?!
E: to the elderly man; meant to be a whisper, but way too loud
N: The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of it.
C: CLERK
D: Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead?
C: KATE
D: Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick?
C: CLERK
D: Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go.
E: had enough
N: Kate doesn't budge.
C: CLERK
D: Seriously, Kate. You should go.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
N: Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears.
C: KATE
D: This is bullshit! I have to pee.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door - - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down and begins to pull up her robe.
C: CLERK
D: What the fuck are you doing?!
C: KATE
D: I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad. *
E: caught
C: CLERK
D: Get outta here NOW!
E: frustrated
C: KATE
D: C'mon...can't we drink together?
E: pleads
N: The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned, and then... ...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.
S: EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN
N: Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her. Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby. A bird SQUAWKS. Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.
S: INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and realizes that -- -- it's 7:30. She jumps out of bed in a panic.
C: KATE
D: Charlie!
N: Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down at the bed, which is -- -- COMPLETELY SOAKED.
C: KATE
D: Not again.
E: CONT'D mumbled
N: Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of the bed.
C: CHARLIE
D: Come back to bed, baby.
C: KATE
D: I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.
C: CHARLIE
D: Well, you peed on me so I guess * we're even. *
C: KATE

C: CHARLIE
D: Well...I can't go to work like this.

E: beat
C: KATE
D: Huh?
C: CHARLIE
D: I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone.
C: KATE
D: Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? You must've been dreaming.
N: Kate then glances down and notices -- -- that HER FEET ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND GRASS. She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - STALL - DAY
N: Kate's on her knees, puking into a toilet. A FEW MOMENTS LATER Kate exits the stall to find -- -- Principal Barnes standing by the door.
C: KATE

N: HILLARY * When will you know?
C: KATE
D: Not until summertime. You guys will be on vacation.
C: RAMON
D: If you have a boy what will you name him?
C: KATE
D: Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?
C: ANGELA
D: That's a name for a man -- not a baby!
N: The children LAUGH. Kate LAUGHS too -- but looks a little freaked out.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY
N: Kate eats her PACKED LUNCH with Mr. Davies.
C: KATE
D: Thanks again for covering for me.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: I can't promise to cover for you every time you get pregnant.
C: KATE
D: There won't be another time.
C: MR. DAVIES

E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: You?
E: shocked
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one. * I'm nine years sober, AA and NA. I used to drink cocaine. It's really cheap in the Philippines.
E: beat off Kate's shocked expression
N: Mr. Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Listen, Kate. I know meetings can be weird. Especially at first, but if you want to...you never need to feel like you have to...but the ones I go to are pretty small. Nice little groups. I'd be happy to take you.
E: CONT'D beat
C: KATE
D: Maybe that would be good...I don't know.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: No pressure, okay. That shit saved my life, though.

E: CONT'D

C: KATE
D: Hey...
C: CHARLIE
D: Howdy.
N: Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him.
C: KATE
D: How was your day? And what's that smell?
C: CHARLIE
D: Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.
C: KATE
D: Charlie! You need to eat.

E: surprised
N: Charlie goes silent.
C: KATE
D: What?
C: CHARLIE
D: Nothing -- I just...I didn't think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday. In fact, it sounded like you hated it. So I'm kinda surprised you're going back.
C: KATE
D: Well...this is a smaller meeting. It might be different. I dunno -- I think I want to give it a fair shot.
N: Charlie nods.
C: KATE
D: Besides -- I was hammered last night. Go on and have fun out drinking with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm just gonna, you know, try something * different...

S: 35 INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
N: Mr. Davies walks Kate into a medium sized room where -- -- about TEN PEOPLE are getting coffee, talking, and setting CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE. Kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting -- several BLUE COLLAR MEN -- -- JENNY: 40-ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of * tough demeanor -- -- a few OLDER PEOPLE, and a YOUNG COUPLE. Mr. Davies directs Kate over to a table with COFFEE and COOKIES.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: This is a little more my speed. No one here is the slightest bit hip.
C: KATE
D: Does everybody just...kinda, you know -- talk here?
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells their story. And then everyone else shares -- talks.
C: KATE
D: So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor?
C: MR. DAVIES
D: No -- I don't think I could do * that. `Cause, um... ...well, it could get weird. But * I'll help you find one if you want. We should sit down.
E: off Kate's expression nervously searches gestures to the seats
N: Kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats.
C: KATE
D: I can't believe I'm really here.
E: takes a deep breath; to Mr. Davies
C: MR. DAVIES
D: It gets better. Weirder, maybe -- but better.
N: LATER The meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of chairs. Jenny is midway through her speech. * JENNY * ...all I knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by. I had no idea how to even look for a normal job or pay my bills on time -- or pay my fucking bills at all. (beat) Now I pay my bills online. The group CHUCKLES. JENNY (CONT'D) * And I found a love in cooking. I've * got my own catering business now. * And...maybe I just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still...it's been years since I woke up in a park -- in a different state. LAUGHTER. Kate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers --
C: KATE
D: I kinda like her.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Sponsor potential?
N: Kate nods.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Get her number at break.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: I feel like you're my wingman.
N: Kate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away. LATER An older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces. ARLO * Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a ten minute break. Smoke em' if you got em. As some of the PEOPLE go outside -- -- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee. *
C: KATE
D: Hey, I liked your speech.
N: JENNY * Thanks. All that dumb shit happened so I'm glad that now it's at least entertaining. (beat) What's your name?
C: KATE
D: Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted.
N: Jenny LAUGHS. * JENNY * Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some of that.
C: KATE
D: I don't really know how this stuff works.
E: MORE
C: KATE
D: But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but...
E: CONT'D
N: JENNY * Yeah, of course. I can help explain it to you -- and also, we can just talk.
C: KATE
D: Okay. Yeah. You've been sober since you were 24?
E: beat
N: Jenny nods. *
C: KATE
D: That seems really young.
E: CONT'D
N: JENNY * I didn't have much of a choice -- I crashed my car into a nursing home. (beat) I think the break is just about over. This meeting is the kind where everyone can share. Sharing always helps me, so...if it's not too weird -- try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on. LATER Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next * to Kate is finishing up. TINA * ...anyway, that's where I'm at today. Thanks for listening. Everyone looks at Kate.
C: KATE
D: Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and... ...I'm an alcoholic?
E: long beat
N: Kate nervously LAUGHS.
C: GROUP
D: Hi, Kate.
C: KATE
D: Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words... ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed. It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary. I'm kinda...scared.
E: beat beat beat
N: Kate stops. Looks around self-consciously.

E: beat
C: MR. DAVIES
D: My first three months were such hell. I think I'm only sober today because I just never want to go through that again.

N: Several people LAUGH.
C: KATE
D: But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem.
E: CONT'D

N: JENNY * When was the last time you saw her?
C: KATE
D: A year, at least.
E: tries to remember
N: JENNY * Well...maybe it's time.
C: KATE
D: Maybe. And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives. We haven't slept together in forever... I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good.
E: beat beat laughs

E: laughs
C: KATE
D: Why?
C: MR. DAVIES
D: I don't know...
C: KATE
D: Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that "men stick with men, women stick with women" stuff.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand.
C: KATE
D: Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me?

D: What am I, one of your students? * Crush?
C: KATE
D: Yeah, crush.
C: MR. DAVIES

E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Davies moves slightly closer to Kate.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: And I know it's wrong, but -- in meetings I stare at your lips and your legs and all I can think about is fucking your moist pussy.

D: Oh, that was a bad thing to say, right?
E: genuinely sorry
C: KATE
D: YES.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: I'm so, so sorry. I'm just confused, and I don't know how to talk to women --
C: KATE
D: Jesus -- you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their "moist pussy." Who even says that?
E: beat
C: MR. DAVIES
D: I'm really sorry.

S: INT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

C: ROCHELLE
D: ...you wouldn't believe how much the neighborhood's changed! After Mr. Baker passed away and the kids put Mrs. Baker in a home, the people that moved in, oof!

E: CONT'D
N: Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts a drink on the table in front of her.
C: ROCHELLE

E: quickly serious
N: Rochelle tears up with joy.
C: ROCHELLE
D: Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna be a grandma! And you know that "no drinking when you're pregnant" thing is just a myth. I drank plenty when I was pregnant with Kate -- and look how she turned out!

N: Beat.
C: KATE
D: I'm not pregnant, mom.
C: ROCHELLE
D: Oh.

E: to Charlie; slightly annoyed to Rochelle beat
N: Rochelle looks slightly disgusted.
C: ROCHELLE
D: Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous. Katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married. Dried up. Left me. You can see how well that worked out for me... ...I raised his daughter in this PALACE while he's somewhere in Florida with his shiny new wife and kids. Bastard. You better be careful -- they change.
E: to Charlie Rochelle gestures to her living room beat long beat; to Charlie
N: Kate and Charlie exchange a glance.
C: KATE
D: I thought you'd be happy for me, mom.
C: ROCHELLE

S: EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTA'S VILLAGE - DAY
N: Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village -- -- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time. Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film. Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around.
C: KATE
D: This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned.

C: KATE
D: This is what I think of when I think of Christmas. Thanks for coming up here with me.

D: Of course.
C: KATE
D: I'm sorry my mom's so awful.
C: CHARLIE

C: CHARLIE
D: Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here?
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: Huh?
C: CHARLIE
D: You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something?
C: KATE
D: Um...no.
C: CHARLIE
D: I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house.
N: Charlie puts his arms around Kate.

C: KATE
D: No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Okay.

N: Another little girl -- WINNIE -- jumps in. * WINNIE * Mrs. Hannah -- did you kill the baby?
C: KATE
D: WHAT? No -- of course not!
N: WINNIE * `Cause my mom says that when you kill a baby you go to hell and you can't even go to church to ask god for forgiveness. The students begin to WHISPER to each other. Another boy -- TOBY -- asks --
C: TOBY
D: Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to hell?
C: KATE
D: No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But... ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant.
E: beat
N: WINNIE * Because a doctor murders it!

C: KATE
D: Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant?
C: MR. DAVIES
D: You want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously?
N: Kate shrugs.
C: MR. DAVIES
D: Well, the good thing is that it's all over now. Principal Barnes will think you're a martyr for losing a baby. The kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it.

C: KATE
D: And the bad news?
E: long beat
C: MR. DAVIES
D: You lied. To your boss -- and a bunch of small children. Who trust you. And rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong.
C: KATE

E: beat MORE
C: CHARLIE
D: ...I gotta say -- this is the boringest meal I've had in about as long as I can remember.
E: CONT'D
N: Kate doesn't look up.
C: CHARLIE
D: Who're you texting?
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: Jenny. *
E: still looking down
C: CHARLIE
D: She's like a parole officer.
C: KATE
D: She's my sponsor.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know.
N: Kate finishes her text. Puts down her phone.
C: KATE
D: So...what'd you do today, honey?
E: fake enthusiasm
C: CHARLIE
D: I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear. You do anything special?
E: beat
C: KATE
D: I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage.
N: Charlie LAUGHS.
C: KATE
D: That's not funny.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way.
C: KATE
D: Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby.
C: CHARLIE
D: God, Kate -- come on. What else were you supposed to do?
C: KATE
D: Well, I feel like a piece of shit for lying.
C: CHARLIE
D: It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is this what those meetings teach you? To make drama out of nothing?
C: KATE
D: It's not nothing. I lied to little kids and to my boss because I can't take responsibility for my actions.
C: CHARLIE
D: Why don't you go and tell the Principal that you were never pregnant? That the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night? Would you feel better about yourself then?
N: Beat.
C: KATE
D: I've been thinking about doing that, actually. Yeah. I think I would feel better about myself.
E: thinks about it
C: CHARLIE
D: Fine. Do it, then. I guess you don't need a job.
C: KATE
D: I could be like you -- I could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible.
C: CHARLIE
D: I never do anything responsible? What about buying this house that we live in? Or the food that we're eating?
E: hurt
C: KATE
D: Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. I think it's pretty much done the opposite.
N: Charlie looks stunned. *
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family that supports us -- and not the other way around.
C: KATE
D: What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
C: CHARLIE
D: Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out. You should be grateful we don't have to struggle.
C: KATE
D: I wouldn't care if we struggled with money. I've struggled with money my whole life. I'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if I - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands.
E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: What the fuck are you talking about?
C: KATE
D: I'm talking about you being a baby. A selfish baby.
C: CHARLIE
D: You know what?
C: KATE
D: What?
C: CHARLIE
D: I fucking hate AA! It turned you into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.
C: KATE
D: At least I'm not drunk all the time.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, you don't drink booze for three months and suddenly you're some saint? You have it all together and I'm just a baby?
N: Kate doesn't answer.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to understand you. But it's hard. You're different and maybe it's good that you're different. Maybe I'm bad and bad for you or something -- because I didn't think the person you were before was so awful. I loved that person. Yeah, she drank a lot and she did some silly things...but she was my Kate.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: You loved that person? Do you not love me now?
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, of course. But it's different. You're different.

C: KATE
D: Everything in life isn't connected to being an alcoholic.
N: JENNY * I'm not just talking about alcoholics. (beat) People are fucking weird. We all have a lot of shit we carry around in our heads that doesn't make sense. (beat) At least alcoholics have tools to work through it. *
C: KATE
D: "Steps"...
N: JENNY * Yeah, steps -- and talking and listening and crying...
C: KATE
D: I have the crying part covered.
N: JENNY * I know, right? I think my first year I cried tears I'd been saving since I was eight. (beat) It's hard to live your life...honestly. You know? Kate nods. JENNY (CONT'D) * Any idea what you're gonna do about your school situation? What you're gonna say? Kate shakes her head.
C: KATE
D: I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything.
N: JENNY * Listen...you wanna stay in my guest * room tonight? You can watch movies, get some good sleep...?
C: KATE
D: You sure that's okay?
N: JENNY * Yeah, of course. That's why I spent money on a guest bed -- so people could sleep in it. (beat) I know it might feel like it, but really, you don't have to figure everything out tonight. (smiles) You've got time.

E: beat
N: Kate's stunned. Looks like she feels terrible.
C: KATE
D: I'm...I'm really sorry.

D: It's okay. It was a long, long time ago. Still hurts sometimes. But eventually...you move on. You have to. Have a seat.
E: beat
N: Kate sits down.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: I got a phone call from a very upset parent. That's how I found out about...you know. Frankly, I'm not sure why you didn't feel like you could tell me.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: I'm not angry with you -- but I need to be clear that this doesn't happen again.
C: KATE
D: It won't. I promise that.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: By "not happening again," I mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems "family matters" with your class. No sex. No god. No drugs and alcohol.
E: beat
C: KATE
D: Okay, I...

E: CONT'D
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: But...you vomited in class.
C: KATE
D: I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is --
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: Oh, my god -- are you really ill? Is it cancer?
C: KATE
D: No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um... ...it's alcoholism.
E: beat
N: Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: What?
C: KATE
D: I've been working on it. I'm one- hundred days sober. When that happened I'd been out drinking and was hung over and --
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: You vomited in front of children because you were hung over?
C: KATE
D: Yes.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: And lied, saying that you were pregnant?
C: KATE
D: Well, a student asked if I was pregnant -- and "yes" just kind of fell out of my mouth.
N: Principal Barnes looks disgusted.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: That's sick, Kate.
C: KATE
D: I know.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: No, I don't think you understand how wrong that is. To lie to me -- to the children. You know I felt so terrible for you when I found out that you had a mis -- ? -- how can you play with people's emotions like that?
E: beat
C: KATE
D: I was sick.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: Jesus...you told us you had a miscarriage.
C: KATE
D: I'm sorry.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: I threw you a baby shower.
C: KATE
D: I'm really sorry. I am. I've been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me. I'm in AA now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything. It's really hard. I mean, I think my husband might hate me, and --
E: beat
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: I'm sorry, but what you did is totally irresponsible.

C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: I can't have you here anymore.
E: beat
C: KATE
D: Am I being fired?
E: surprised
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: No, no -- the state wouldn't allow that without a report. I'm not going to write a report. Because, frankly, I have no idea what that report would say. But I'm forcing you to take a leave of absence and I think it's in your best interest if you find a job elsewhere.
E: beat
C: KATE
D: Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm doing the right things now.
C: PRINCIPAL BARNES
D: I believe you -- or I want to. I really do. But honey -- I believed you before. I'll have a sub take over your class starting tomorrow. It's late enough in the year that we can just say you're having personal problems

C: BARTENDER
D: Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause I take it you've had a bad day, but um... I think you need to go home.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: Why?
C: BARTENDER
D: Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p.m.
C: KATE
D: What about him?
N: Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar.
C: KATE
D: You're not kicking him out.
E: CONT'D
C: BARTENDER
D: I'm just trying to be a pal.
C: KATE
D: Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA. It didn't work.
E: beat
C: BARTENDER
D: Oh, boy...
C: KATE
D: You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase.
E: MORE

E: CONT'D
C: BARTENDER
D: Wow, okay, well...I'm real sorry. But this place gets a little nuts after sundown and I don't think a pretty girl who just left AA should be here. I'm gonna call you a cab.

C: BARTENDER
D: Lady, you're done.
C: KATE
D: You think I'm above smoking crack? `Cause I'm not. And are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me...?
N: Kate leans across the bar, trying to look "seductive" -- but she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool.
C: BARTENDER
D: No.
C: KATE
D: Just a teensy bit...?
C: BARTENDER
D: Not in the slightest.
C: KATE
D: Well...you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm smart. And I'm...

C: KATE
D: ...a good person.
E: CONT'D
C: BARTENDER

E: suddenly angry
C: BARTENDER
D: You do that.
C: KATE
D: I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams about me.

C: BARTENDER
D: Hope that works out for you.
C: KATE
D: Can't believe my luck. I just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me. Life is stupid.

D: Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk.

N: Charlie -- who's creeped out now -- forcefully pushes Kate off.

N: Kate has become quite angry and belligerent by this point -- and begins picking up HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS and throwing them at Charlie.
C: KATE
D: With me? With me?! What the fuck is wrong with me? I try hard and I get shit on! Fucked up family, fired from my job -- this marriage. Nothing's wrong with me! What's wrong with YOU?!
C: CHARLIE

We have one birthday tonight -- for Kate, for one year. (beat) Jenny and Dave are giving her the * cake. Kate hugs everyone -- then blows out ONE CANDLE on a CAKE before standing at the podium.
C: KATE
D: Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic.
C: GROUP
D: Hi, Kate.
C: KATE
D: I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober. Well...that is SO not true! I had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. And I was adorable. I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute.
E: beat beat
N: People in the crowd LAUGH a little bit.
C: KATE
D: When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't. My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet... ...that isn't what I signed up for. Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again "the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off." I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true. When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome.
E: CONT'D beat shakes her head beat beat beat
N: People knowingly LAUGH.
C: KATE
D: I wasn't happy being the "good-time girl," though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it.

E: CONT'D beat beat

S: 72 INT. BAR - NIGHT 72 *
N: Charlie, Owen, and a woman -- MILLIE -- stand at the bar, drinking BEER and WHISKEY SHOTS. Owen speaks -- but Millie seems way more into Charlie.
C: OWEN
D: I was in North Carolina for a while * -- Durham -- playing minor league ball. I had some real heat. That's when I met Crash, here. He'd been sent down to single-A to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball-player. We got involved with the same woman -- an older chick -- but Crash won her in the end. He's really taught me some...important life-lessons.
E: gestures to Charlie beat

D: I don't know. Which one? Do you know what movie she means?
E: plays dumb to Charlie
N: Charlie -- who's pretty hammered -- shakes his head.
C: MILLIE
D: "Bull"...something? What is it?
N: Charlie and Owen feign ignorance.
C: MILLIE
D: Whatever. It'll come to me. So...what do you do now, Crash?
E: CONT'D to Charlie; flirty
C: CHARLIE
D: I write about music.
C: MILLIE
D: Really?
N: Owen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like...
N: Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence. Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm.
C: MILLIE
D: Like what?
C: CHARLIE
D: Huh?
C: MILLIE
D: You were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off, honey.
C: OWEN
D: So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in "The Show," and what the crowds were like, and --
E: trying to save the situation
C: CHARLIE
D: It was crazy. I...
N: Charlie drifts off for a moment.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a great lady. You have lovely hands and hair but...
E: CONT'D to Millie
N: Charlie begins to walk away, wobbly on his feet.
C: CHARLIE
D: ...I'm gonna go to the...I'm just gonna go.
E: CONT'D
N: Charlie stumbles off.
C: MILLIE
D: You want a ride...?
E: as Charlie leaves
N: Charlie exits the bar.
C: MILLIE
D: Um...is he cool to drive?
E: CONT'D to Owen
C: OWEN
D: Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his bicycle.
C: MILLIE
D: He rides a bicycle?
C: OWEN
D: Oh, yeah -- -- as a teenager, he was a bike racing champion growing up in Bloomington, Indiana. He and his friends were called the "Cutters" -- and they beat a bunch of rich college kids in this big race. It was great.
E: smiles MORE
C: OWEN
D: Back then, I was a kickboxing instructor...
E: CONT'D beat
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Charlie rides his BICYCLE down the street. Swerving all over the place, he's obviously drunk. Red and Blue LIGHTS flash behind him. Charlie turns to see -- -- a POLICE OFFICER. *
S: INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Charlie leaves Kate a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.
C: CHARLIE
D: So, I got into a little trouble -- drunk in public. On a bicycle. Um, I was thinking...maybe I need to go to one of those meetings. I'd like to go with you, though. If that's cool. Let me know if we could discuss it sometime, okay? Maybe you could come over to our -- um, my house? Uh...yeah. Thanks.
E: into phone; seems sort of nervous beat beat beat
N: Charlie hangs up the phone.
C: CHARLIE
D: "Let me know if we could discuss it sometime?" Such an idiot...
E: CONT'D to himself shakes his head
S: 75 EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STREET/FRONT YARD - DAY 75 *
N: Kate and Charlie stand by Kate's car, which is parked in front by the street. She's just arrived. Awkward tension.
C: CHARLIE
D: Miss our house?
C: KATE
D: Um...yeah. Sometimes.
C: CHARLIE
D: Miss me?
E: hesitant
N: Beat.
C: KATE
D: Sometimes. I've been sober for a year.
E: long beat
C: CHARLIE
D: Really?
C: KATE
D: Yeah.
N: Kate reaches into her purse and takes out her ONE YEAR CHIP, showing it to Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: They gave you that?
C: KATE
D: Yeah. A couple of days ago. Tuesday.
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's really...really...just great. I mean it. Tuesday is the night I got pulled over. Parallel lives, huh?
E: beat laughs
N: Kate rolls her eyes.
C: CHARLIE
D: So -- you dating anyone?
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: Charlie...
E: taken aback
C: CHARLIE
D: Are you?
N: Silence.
C: KATE
D: No.
N: Charlie seems relieved.
C: CHARLIE
D: Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his "wing-man" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number. Wanna go out sometime?
E: beat
C: KATE
D: I don't think it's a good idea.
N: Charlie nods. Long beat.
C: CHARLIE
D: I fucked up, didn't I?
N: Kate looks down, doesn't speak.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes.
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: Charlie, please don't do this.
C: CHARLIE
D: I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's...
C: KATE
D: I don't like shitty 80's music. I like good 80's music.
E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: ...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real.
N: Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile.
C: CHARLIE
D: Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot.
E: CONT'D changing course
S: 76 INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 76 *
N: Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general, the room looks more "dude."
C: KATE
D: You look really thin.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah?
C: KATE
D: When did you last eat?
C: CHARLIE
D: I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. I think, um...
E: seems slightly concerned * that he can't remember
C: KATE
D: Should we order something?
C: CHARLIE
D: Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich...
C: KATE
D: I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing.
C: CHARLIE
D: Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat. Have you given up fun, too?
E: beat
N: Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she finds him funny.
C: CHARLIE
D: Sorry. Bad joke.
E: CONT'D off Kate
N: Kate cracks a smile.
C: KATE
D: Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them.
N: Charlie raises his eyebrows.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay...
N: LATER Kate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs. Charlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER. Kate glances at him.
C: CHARLIE
D: Sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge.
C: KATE
D: I don't care if you drink a beer.
C: CHARLIE
D: You sure?
C: KATE
D: Yeah. Whatever.
C: CHARLIE
D: No...I'm good.
E: thinks about it
N: LATER Kate stands by the stove and watches as -- -- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the bacon and egg sandwich. Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much.
S: EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - TWILIGHT
N: Kate and Charlie play croquet. * They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: Have you been playing a lot?
C: KATE
D: I haven't played in over a year.
C: CHARLIE
D: Then how're you beating me?
C: KATE
D: I don't know. Innate talent?
N: They keep playing.
C: CHARLIE
D: I haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated.
C: KATE
D: Um...stick to the game, okay?
N: Long beat.
C: CHARLIE
D: I've been masturbating like crazy.
C: KATE
D: Charlie --
C: CHARLIE
D: I miss you.
C: KATE
D: Stop it.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay. Fine.
N: Beat.
C: KATE
D: You could've been killed.
C: CHARLIE
D: What?
E: confused
C: KATE
D: Riding your bike -- drunk.
C: CHARLIE
D: But I wasn't.
C: KATE
D: But is that really the point?
C: CHARLIE
D: What are trying to say?
C: KATE
D: I worry about you.
E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, I can understand that. I used to worry about you. But now I know you're okay. That makes me happy...I mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but I'm glad you're doing well.
E: laughs beat
N: No reply from Kate.
C: CHARLIE
D: Would you move back in if I came to meetings?
E: CONT'D
C: KATE
D: You should go for yourself, not to make me happy.
C: CHARLIE
D: But, would you?
C: KATE
D: I'm not moving back in.
N: That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.
C: KATE
D: Listen, I should go. It's gonna get dark soon.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLIE
D: We can always turn the lights on.
C: KATE
D: I don't know...
N: Beat.
C: CHARLIE
D: So, would you at least...let me take you out on a date?
N: Kate says nothing.
C: CHARLIE
D: Maybe...?
E: CONT'D
N: Kate shakes her head. Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay...fine. 0 for 2. Last question: can we just...play one more game?
E: CONT'D new direction
N: Kate doesn't answer.
C: CHARLIE
D: C'mon...you keep kicking my ass. It's embarrassing. You've gotta give me a chance to redeem myself. Please.
E: CONT'D soft
N: Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes... ...but she also doesn't say no. There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: THE END
