S: EXT. A DITCH - NIGHT
N: A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night, DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a beat. Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine. The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids. Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding. Bleeding a lot. She tries to push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles. Her legs are useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of perverse joy to her face, like she's just remembered the punchline to a favorite joke.

E: V.O., CONT'D
N: SPARKS. A cigarette lighter flares. We're in the trunk of a car with SIMON BAINES (22), a skinny Brit with surfer hair. He looks around, realizes where he is. Panicked, he starts POUNDING and KICKING.
C: CLAIRE
D: You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind.
E: V.O., CONT'D

S: INT. UNIDENTIFIABLE ROOM - DAY
N: We keep tight on CLAIRE MONTGOMERY (19) as she talks to an unseen guest. Christmas lights blink behind her. CLAIRE (CONT'd) But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here. She takes a sip of coffee, smiles. She has a bewitching smile.

S: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
N: A cash drawer slides shut. On the far side of the checkout stand, a STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN counts food stamps. Her eyes are sunken, black. She's got a screaming BABY on her arm and two rambunctious BOYS in the cart. They're wearing pajamas and raincoats. It's five a.m. and the store is almost empty. Containers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the conveyor belt. Ronna Martin -- the girl in the ditch -- is bagging groceries.
C: RONNA
D: Paper or plastic?
N: She wears a green apron with a red "Yule Save More" button. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: RONNA
D: Paper or plastic?
N: She's been working for fourteen hours, and it shows. Her intonation doesn't change at all.
C: RONNA
D: Paper or plastic?
C: STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
D: Both.
N: Finally satisfied she has all her stamps, the Woman starts looking through the receipt. In the cart, the boys knock gum from the stand.
C: STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
D: You didn't double my coupons.
C: RONNA
D: They're at the bottom. In red. Where it says, double coupons.
N: She finishes one bag and starts another. The Woman is watching her carefully.
C: STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
D: You can't do that. You can't put bleach in the same bag as food. It's poison.
N: Ronna fishes out the bleach and makes a big show of wrapping it in a plastic bag.
C: STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
D: Don't think you're something you're not. I used to have your job.
N: Ronna puts the bag in the cart. Looks her dead in the eye.

S: 6A INT. SUPERMARKET STOCKROOM - DAY 6A
N: Dark and dusty, packed floor to ceiling with crates and palettes. Offscreen, a SOAP OPERA plays on TV. Ronna comes around the corner, a thundercloud of anger and frustration. She passes by CLAIRE (19) and the British SIMON (21) at the phone, sorting through a crumpled list. Simon's eyes track Ronna as she passes.
C: CLAIRE
D: Don't.
E: low
C: SIMON
D: Why not?
C: CLAIRE
D: She's been on for fourteen hours.
N: At her locker, Ronna misdials the combination. Frustrated, she POUNDS the locker, then re-dials. Simon approaches Ronna gingerly. Claire gives up on him, setting to work opening a box of expired cookies.
C: SIMON
D: Ronna?
C: RONNA
D: No.
N: She trades her apron for her coat.
C: SIMON
D: I haven't asked you yet.

E: punches out
N: Claire looks over, looks away. Ronna heads for the door leading outside.

E: beat; she's not sold

C: RONNA
D: Deal.
N: Beyond exhausted, she starts walking back to the store. After a beat...
C: SIMON
D: Ronna? Are you certain I couldn't have a blowjob?

S: INT. SUPERMARKET / CHECKOUT LANE - DAY
N: Ronna rips off a receipt, handing it to a CLUTCHY OLD WOMAN. Starts scanning someone else's groceries. Mannie is digging out returns from under Ronna's checkstand. He suddenly looks up.
C: MANNIE
D: Xerxes.
C: RONNA
D: What?
C: MANNIE
D: Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with X.
C: RONNA
D: That wasn't it. I never heard of fucking "Xerxes."
C: MANNIE
D: Pharaoh coulda saved your ass.
N: Mannie pushes his cart down to the next checkstand.
C: VOICE
D: There's an opera about him.
E: O.S.
N: Ronna looks up at the customer, a handsome college guy (ADAM). He's cute in that fresh-scrubbed, Midwestern way.
C: ADAM
D: Xerxes. I took music appreciation twice.
N: ON RONNA Whatever. Adam's friend ZACK is with him in line, YABBERING on a cellular phone. Ronna hits total. $25.12. Adam hands her a credit card. She swipes it through the machine and starts bagging their groceries.
C: ADAM
D: Does a British guy still work here?
C: RONNA
D: He went to Vegas for the weekend.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) A glance between Adam and Zack, hard to read why. Zack nods for Adam to go ahead.
C: ADAM
D: Betcha wonder why we're buying all this orange juice.
C: RONNA
D: Scurvy?
N: She's not going to rise to the bait. Zack looks over at Adam, then to Ronna.
C: ZACK
D: Say... Ronna. You don't know where we could get something to go with this orange juice, do you?
E: checks nametag
C: RONNA
D: Doughnuts, aisle four.
C: ZACK
D: But then you get the weird taste in your mouth. I was thinking something a little more euphoric. The British guy usually hooks us up.
N: She stops bagging. Looks at Adam. At Zack.
C: RONNA
D: How much?
C: ZACK
D: Twenty at twenty.
C: RONNA
D: You're overpaying.
C: ZACK
D: We're desperate. A bunch of us are going to this party tonight, this warehouse thing...

C: ZACK
D: A friend was supposed to get the stuff in Chicago, but now he's snowed in. So if you could help us out here...
E: low
N: All three watch Switterman pass. It gives Ronna a beat to think. She hands Zack a post-it note and a pen. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)

C: ADAM
D: Absolutely.
S: INT. MANNIE'S CAR / PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: The Beast is Mannie's pride and joy, a late-70's Toyota held together with duct tape and prayer. It's outfitted for the season with Christmas lights lining the windshield and back window. Santa has replaced Jesus on the dashboard. Ronna climbs in the passenger door, counting a stack of 20's fresh from the ATM. Claire's in back.
C: CLAIRE
D: You know that Simon's in Vegas.
C: RONNA
D: I don't need Simon. I'm going to Todd.
C: MANNIE
D: Todd GAINES?
C: CLAIRE
D: Who's Todd Gaines?
C: MANNIE
D: Simon's dealer.
N: Claire sits forward in the seat, suddenly worried.
C: CLAIRE
D: You can't do that, can you? I mean, go around Simon.
N: She looks at Mannie. He shrugs, unsure.
C: RONNA
D: Ok, listen up. If Simon were here -- which he's not -- he would charge fifteen, when I know he gets it for ten.
E: MORE
C: 10A.
D: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions RONNA Times twenty hits, that's a hundred bucks I'd be pissing out my dick.
E: SALMON cont'd
C: MANNIE
D: But it's like an evolutionary leap. You're moving up the drug food chain. Without permission.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: CLAIRE
D: Ronna, you shouldn't do this.
N: Ronna pockets the cash. Mannie's about to say something when she stops him.
C: RONNA
D: Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back and watch.
N: Mannie and Claire remain unconvinced. Ronna reaches for the keys, CRANKING the ignition even though Mannie's driving. The ENGINE purrs. RONNA (CONT'd) Besides, Todd likes me. This won't be any problem. A BUZZER sounds.
S: EXT. DOORSTEP - NIGHT
N: Ronna stands by the intercom of a two-story walkup in Hollywood. Waiting, she looks back to the street, where The Beast sits idle at the curb.
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: Speak!
C: RONNA
D: Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me through Simon.
N: A long pause.
C: INTERCOM VOICE
D: Yeah?
C: RONNA
D: Can I come up?
N: Another long pause. Ronna looks back at The Beast, embarrassed. Finally the door BUZZES and a latch CLICKS open. Stairs lead up. She motions back "five minutes" to The Beast. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Three out of four lights are burned out in the hallway. A few feet ahead of Ronna, a door stands partly ajar. A weird red-and-green light spills out through the crack, along with an Alice in Chains SONG.
S: INT. APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Ronna pushes the door open from the hallway.
C: RONNA
D: Todd?
N: Shades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality. The light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of red and green light. Broken CD's dangle off a tiny Christmas tree by the stereo. Slacker seasonalism.
C: GAINES
D: Don't let the cat out.
E: O.S.
N: Ronna closes the door behind her. TODD GAINES emerges from the darkened bedroom, tying the string on a pair of sweat pants. That's all he's wearing.
C: RONNA
D: I didn't wake you up, did I?
C: GAINES
D: Nah.
N: He settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro. Adjusts himself in the crotch. Motions for her to take a chair. She's more nervous than she wants to let on.
C: GAINES
D: I thought you were still buying quarters off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are quarters.
C: RONNA
D: I keep him honest.
C: GAINES
D: At that level you're supposed to pinch. It's the economics of it.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) IN THE BACKGROUND A WOMAN with a ballerina's body comes out of the bedroom. She tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top.
C: GAINES
D: You leaving?
N: She leans over the back of the sofa for quick, tonguey kiss. In a sneak attack, she shoves a Santa's hat down to his ears. He bats the white pom out of his eyes.
C: GAINES
D: Be good.
N: The woman is out the door without a word. Gaines looks back over at Ronna, not the least bit self-conscious about the hat.
C: GAINES
D: I take it this is not a social call.
C: RONNA
D: I need a favor.
C: GAINES
D: A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such good friends, Ronna. Because if we were, you would know I give head before I give favors. I don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim. You might try just telling me what you want to buy.
E: beat
C: RONNA
D: Twenty hits of ecstacy.
N: He takes a deep drag on the cigarette, looking at her. Blows the smoke out. He picks up a remote control. Aims it at the stereo. CLOSE UP The volume meter, climbing fast. Out of the green, into the red. The MUSIC is deafening. ON GAINES On top of Ronna, face in her ear. His hand wraps around her head, holding her tight. We can't HEAR what he's saying. Ronna's eyes betray her fear. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) He backs off. She looks confused. He nods. Do it. The MUSIC still BLARING, she stands and slowly unbuttons her shirt. Takes it off -- very self-consciously. Pulls her t- shirt off over her head. Just her bra underneath. He motions for her to turn around. She does, then back. Her hands are shaking. She holds them together. Gaines aims the remote at the stereo. The MUSIC retreats.
C: GAINES
D: You come here out of the blue asking for twenty hits. Just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell becomes trafficking.
C: RONNA
D: Todd, I would never fuck you like that.
C: GAINES
D: How would you fuck me? Would you strap it on?
N: He climbs over the sofa to a dresser. In a drawer, he digs down through a pile of socks to find a wide-mouthed bottle. And an empty Tylenol bottle. Blows out the dust.
C: GAINES
D: What's the occasion?
C: RONNA
D: There's this big Christmas party thing. Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are doing sort of a pre-party thing.
C: GAINES
D: Friends of yours. You're not going to go and try to sell this on me, are you?
C: RONNA
D: No.
C: GAINES
D: You're not dealing.
C: RONNA
D: Swear to God.
N: He transfers pills from the big bottle to the Tylenol bottle. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: GAINES
D: This is the real thing. Pharmaceutical grade, not that crunchy herbal rave shit. Don't let anyone double dose or you'll be frying eggs off `em in the emergency room. One hit per headbanger.
C: RONNA
D: Understood.
N: He snaps the cap on tight.
C: GAINES
D: Twenty at fifteen is 300.
C: RONNA
D: Fifteen? I was thinking more like ten.
C: GAINES
D: You already did strap it on.
C: RONNA
D: It's just that I know you charge Simon ten.
C: GAINES
D: Inflation's a bitch.
N: He offers it to Ronna, who doesn't reach out for it.
C: RONNA
D: Here's the deal. There's 20 of us. I need all of this. But I only have two hundred. I mean, that's all I have.
N: Gaines undoes the cap of the Tylenol bottle, starts pouring the pills back out.
C: RONNA
D: No, hear me out. This two-hundred is like a downpayment. You give me the stuff, I get the extra hundred from them, then I come right back and pay you.
E: CONT'D
C: GAINES
D: See, that would be doing you a favor, and you know how I feel about favors.
C: RONNA
D: I could leave something with you. Collateral.
N: He gives her a quick look over. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: GAINES
D: I already got a fucking Swatch. I need something I know you'll come back for.
N: Ronna looks at the Tylenol bottle in his hands. Thinking...
S: EXT. THE BEAST - NIGHT
N: Ronna kneels down beside the passenger window. Knocks on the glass. Claire rolls down the window. MUSIC spills out.
C: RONNA
D: Claire, could you come up with me for a sec?
S: EXT. DOORSTEP - NIGHT
N: The release BUZZER stops as Ronna pulls open the door to the stairs. Claire just stands there, disbelieving, making no motion to go in.
C: RONNA
D: Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just have to sit there.
C: CLAIRE
D: Hello! He's a drug dealer.
C: RONNA
D: Jesus, Claire. Don't get 818 on me here. How much shit have I done for you? This is nothing.
C: CLAIRE
D: No. No! You're making me an accessory.
C: RONNA
D: Claire. That bracelet of mine you're wearing is an accessory. You are just some chick who's sitting in an apartment. That's it.
N: It's not just the matter at hand, but years of minor adjustment and one-upsmanship. Ronna finally drops the bravado.
C: RONNA
D: Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don't get this money, I get evicted. My ass is out the street.
C: CLAIRE
D: You could...
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)

C: CLAIRE
D: Forty-five minutes. That's like eight o'clock.
C: RONNA
D: We'll be back by eight, I promise.
N: Ronna holds the door as Claire reluctantly steps inside.
S: INT. MANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT
N: The clock on the dashboard reads 8:04. RONNA (v.o.) Is this it? Are you sure? ENGINE running, The Beast is parked along a residential street in Venice. In the driver's seat, Mannie looks for an address.
C: MANNIE
D: Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for directions.
N: He kills the engine. Ronna does a quick face-check in the rear view mirror. She's out the door, moving a hundred miles an hour.
C: MANNIE
D: Ronna!
N: She looks back in. Mannie shakes the Tylenol bottle she forgot. Tosses them to her.
C: MANNIE
D: You're a pro.
C: RONNA
D: I'm a top-seeded amateur.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) She pockets the bottle. SLAMS the door. Mannie tracks her as she circles the car.
C: MANNIE
D: And I'm a very happy man.
N: In his palm, two tablets. He works up a good gob of spit, then swallows them both. They're bitter as hell.
S: INT. VENICE HOUSE / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
N: A beefy guy named BURKE HALVERSON reaches out a hand.
C: BURKE
D: Damn good to meet you, Rhonda.
C: RONNA
D: Ronna.
C: BURKE
D: Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in, I thought we were fucked for sure. Glad we found you.
N: Her PAGER goes off, a shrill CRY. She quiets it, checks the number. Burke smiles.
C: BURKE
D: Work work work. Friday must be a busy night.
C: RONNA
D: That was just a friend.
N: Only now do we TURN to see Adam and Zack standing nearby, trying to look cool. Their house is spartan even by frat-boy standards, just goodwill furniture and as-is Ikea.
C: BURKE
D: Hey. What can I get you to drink?
E: O.S.
C: RONNA
D: Some of that orange juice would be great.
N: Burke does a hepcat swing through the kitchen door, leaving Ronna alone with Adam and Zack.

N: He hands her a beer.

D: Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of orange juice. It's in the car.

C: RONNA
D: You got a bathroom?
E: suddenly
C: ADAM
D: Down the hall on the right.
C: ZACK
D: Let me show you...
N: He moves at Ronna strangely. It freaks her out.
C: BURKE
D: Maybe we could do this first.

C: ADAM
D: We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia.

SWITTERMAN comes ROARING by behind her, heading for the front. She tries to duck away, but he's too steamed to even notice her. Ronna does a quick check to see if she got everything.

N: Mannie's hand flops down to the window. Claire hands him the joint. From RONNA'S P.O.V., we see the floor is still littered with dozens of boxes of medicine. A beat. She picks up a box. An idea forming, Ronna sits back up. Smiles.

N: Ronna and Claire weave through the densely packed lot, where RAVE-GOERS party in and around their cars, drinking and smoking. As they walk, Ronna pops allergy medicine out of a blister-foil pack. She tosses the box away. Scanning the lot, she points to a mini-van.

Looks at it more closely... Pulls open a drawer full of socks. Digs out the wide-mouthed bottle. Shakes out a pill. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Flicks on a desk lamp.

N: A grinding, sweating sea of humanity. In the mosh pit, SKINHEADS and coked-up POSEURS run in blind circles. A stringy- haired EYELINER BOY crashes into RONNA who had her own groove going. She shoves him back into the wheel, a foot on his ass. Claire, behind her, YELLS something in her ear. We can't hear a thing. Ronna downs the rest of her drink, hands Claire the cup. That's not what Claire meant -- she's a little pissed -- but Ronna is oblivious. Both hands free, Ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of the storm. She adjusts her holly crown. She's sky high and loving every minute of it.

S: INT. BY THE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
N: Sweating hard, Mannie is pressed back against a pole, shirt over his head. Two nose-ringed RIOT GRRRLS are drawing a Christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic marker. Looking over at the entrance, he watches some GAPSTERS move past the BOUNCERS. And behind them, TODD GAINES. Mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic. He hunches down. Gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd. Mannie works his way into the mob. STROBES fire overhead. Ronna dances on, oblivious... Gaines circles, searching... Mannie fights his way through the outer ring of MOSHERS... Through the crowd, we see Gaines looking in... Mannie grabs Ronna... She smiles, tries to kiss him... He YELLS in her ear. He has to repeat himself... She looks back over her shoulder... A space in the crowd... She sees Gaines. He sees her. The MUSIC STOPS. Dead silence. Ronna and Gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity, until suddenly... The MUSIC BLASTS back, harder than ever. Like a shot, Ronna and Mannie are out of there. Gaines plows through the crowd, coming after them.

N: She puts a hand on his sweating forehead. His cheeks.
C: RONNA
D: Jesus. You're burning up.

C: RONNA
D: Listen to me. We're going to find Claire and get out of here.
S: EXT. ALLEY / DUMPSTERS - NIGHT
N: Ronna half-carries Mannie down the alley. He's too heavy to lift, and too out of it to go much further. He collapses to his knees. She can't get him back up. Without warning, he HEAVES. We hear the SPLASH on the asphalt. She props his head back against a dumpster. Wipes his face.
C: RONNA
D: Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave you here. I'm going to get the car and come back for you.
N: She fishes the keys out of his pocket. Mannie grabs onto her arm, tight. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)

S: EXT. FIELD / EDGE OF PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: In the distance, we hear the RUMBLE of the music. Keeping low, Ronna works her way down a row, coming to Mannie's car. She tries one key, then another. We LOOK UP to see Todd Gaines watching her from the hood of a nearby car.
C: GAINES
D: How's it going, Ronna? How are sales?
N: Her heart skips a beat. She drops the keys.
C: RONNA
D: Todd, I can explain.

N: He climbs off the car, approaching.
C: GAINES [CONT'D]
D: The thing is, it's not like I'm in a highly ethical industry. But goddamn, Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy hits.
N: He pulls his gun from the back of his jeans. By instinct, she starts to move away. A red Miata moves down the row behind Ronna. She looks to it for help, but it's already passed.
C: RONNA
D: It's not what it looks like. I mean, it sort of is, but it's complicated.
C: GAINES

C: RONNA
D: I have the cash. I have more than I owe you.
C: GAINES
D: So now you're an entrepreneur.
N: At the last moment, Ronna bolts. She ducks around the corner of a van, only to see... A RED MIATA doing 20 in reverse. It brakes, but there's no time. It hits her hard. She flies up over the roof of the car, CRASHING down on the soft top. Her limp body starts to slip down the windshield, but finally sticks. PUSH IN ON GAINES seeing the hit. HEARING it. Stunned. A beat, then we hear the engine REV, pulling back again. That shakes Ronna loose, letting her drop over the headlights in front. Rolling down the slope at the edge of the field, Ronna topples ass-first into a drainage ditch. Her body lands with a sickening THUD. GAINES stands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded. He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt and grass. For a moment, all is quiet. Finally, Gaines tucks the gun into his jeans. One last look around, then he starts working his way back across the parking lot. Disappears. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
S: EXT. IN THE DITCH - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: We stay on Ronna's body as we HEAR the Miata suddenly pull away. Somewhere in the distance, the Mary Xmas Supafest is still RAGING, but here it's only a WHISPER with a beat. With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves. Turns herself over on her back. Each breath WHEEZES and GURGLES. She pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and tosses it aside. She tries to push herself up. Her legs won't move. Catching her breath, she looks to the top of the ditch, waiting for somebody to look in. No one does. Adjusting herself, she slides against a weathered magazine. Spin. Jane's Addiction on the cover. She collapses back, a new wave of pain. After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a COUGHING. She pushes her hair back, streaking blood across her face.
C: RONNA
D: Mannie!!
N: There's no answer. The YELLING hurts. She won't do that again.
C: RONNA
D: Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the fuck it was! Perry Farrell's dead girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A. Fuck, I knew there was one.

N: Simon keeps KICKING.
C: SIMON
D: Fucking let me out of here!
N: The lighter burns his thumb. He switches hands. Listens for a second. The car isn't driving anymore. He tries to catch his breath, but keeps getting more panicked. A key SCRAPES in the lock. The trunk lid opens a crack. Bright daylight spills in. Simon KICKS the lid and pops up, ready to swing a tire iron. THREE MEN back off, laughing. We are...
S: EXT. SIDE OF INTERSTATE - DAY
C: TINY
D: Mo'fuckin Jack-in-the-box.
N: TINY (19) is not black, but thinks he is. Simon climbs out of the trunk and does a face-plant in the gravel. He's shit-faced drunk.
C: MARCUS
D: Dude, you passed out before we left L.A.
N: MARCUS (24) was a tailback at UCLA, and still has the build. He is black, and has no confusion over this matter. Simon is about to reply when he suddenly HEAVES. Everyone backs away.

D: Pop! Goes the asshole.

N: A massive land yacht from the pre-Embargo era. SINGH (23) is driving, nursing a beer. Marcus reads a magazine. Tiny talks from the enormous back seat, where Simon is recuperating.
C: TINY
D: So this chick, she's bobbing up and down on my dick like she's fucking Marilyn Chambers.
C: SINGH
D: She actually found your dick?
C: TINY
D: Then she starts going around the ouside-- you know, painting the tree--when WHACK! It hits her in the eye. And her contact, it's like stuck on my dick.

C: MARCUS
D: Was it hard or soft?

D: What, my dick?
C: SINGH
D: The contact lens.
C: MARCUS
D: Do you remember if it was a colored lens? That she used to have two blue eyes and now she had one blue and one brown?
C: TINY
D: What the fuck does that matter?
C: MARCUS
D: It matters because it happened to me. It was my story. I told this story about a year ago. The difference was, I knew those small-but-important details. That, and it was true.

C: MARCUS
D: You shouldn't eat shrimp. It's loaded with iodine.
E: to Simon
C: TINY
D: This shit is expensive. You're paying five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit.
N: Tiny up-ends the rest of the shrimp cocktail onto his plate. Pissed, Singh scoops away a handful for himself. AT THE TABLE The guys eat. Tiny tries to make a sandwich out of the various foods on his plate, but the bread keeps crumbling.
C: MARCUS
D: Thing is, most people really don't know how to make love. They just put it in and move it around until they get off. What tantra teaches you is how to prolong and deepen the experience, bring it to a higher level. If one man in ten were having the sex I'm having, there would be no war.

C: BECKY
D: Otherwise, I can't hold it in.
E: explaining
N: Simon hands her the pipe and the lighter. Rebecca blows a perfect smoke ring at Simon. He smiles, a little smoke escaping. She leans close and kisses him. Softly at first, then harder. They're a few beats into it when...
C: BECKY
D: Oh my God!
N: Her kleenex is on fire, flames in each nostril. Hands waving, she stands up. Snorts hard. The plugs shoot out, landing on the carpet, which begins to smolder. Simon stamps the flames out.
C: REBECCA
D: You're fine. You're fine.
N: Becky is crying.
C: REBECCA
D: Tell her she's fine.
E: to Simon
C: SIMON

S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
N: Simon slides between the two Beckys, three naked bodies clenching and releasing. CLOSE ON SIMON breathing harder and faster, faster, until he suddenly stops. The expression on his face is agonizing, like a tightrope walker about to lose his balance. The Beckys stop to watch him, worried he might be hurt. Finally, he breathes again.

N: LATER A new position, Rebecca on top and sweating. Next to Simon, Becky is passed out and SNORING. It's only as we look over Rebecca's back that we see THE CURTAINS ARE ON FIRE. On the bed, Simon lies motionless in aching nirvana. His head turns. He sees the flames. And does nothing. Rebecca reaches climax with an inhuman series of MOANS. It's on the third of these that the smoke alarm suddenly BLEATS. It settles into a piercing WHINE. Becky falls out of bed, disoriented. Sees the fire and SCREAMS. Rebecca climbs off Simon to attack the flames with a pillow, beating them down. Holding her head together, Becky tries to reach the smoke detector itself. Amid the chaos, Simon feels for his shoes.
S: INT. HALLWAY / ELEVATOR BAY - NIGHT
N: In the elevator on the right, Simon jabs at the button while getting his jeans on. As his doors slide closed, the left elevator opens, revealing hotel SECURITY.
S: INT. CASINO MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Gentle Christmas MUZAK. At the sinks, Marcus wets his fingers to fix his hair. An OLD TEXAN washes his hands at the next sink, looks around for a towel. Marcus takes two from the dispenser, hands them over. When he's finished, the Texan sets the crumpled towels on the counter, along with a dollar bill. He taps his hat and leaves.

C: FERRARI MAN
D: Keep it close and there's an extra ten bucks for you.
N: He slips Marcus a five as he rushes into the casino. A beat. Simon is cracking up. As we REVERSE, we see the valets are wearing the same yellow sportcoat as Marcus.

D: Get in. Get in the car. Get in.
S: INT. THE FERRARI / DRIVING ON FREEWAY - NIGHT
N: Top off, wind whipping. Marcus downshifts, letting the engine RACE as he passes another sports car. The STEREO is blasting. Pale and dazed, Simon tries to light a cigarette. It blows out of his fingers. It was his last. He adjusts himself in his seat, uncomfortable.

D: Question. When you're doing tantra, you hold it in at the end, right?
E: shouting over noise
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)

C: SIMON
D: Orange County.
N: He throws it out. He tries to shut the compartment, but it's caught on something. He reaches in...
C: SIMON
D: Holy shit.
N: Marcus looks over. Simon gently pulls out a 9mm Baretta. Fascinated, he turns it over in his hands. Marcus tries to keep an eye on the road.
C: MARCUS
D: Don't point it at me!
C: SIMON
D: How do I know if it's loaded?
C: MARCUS
D: First, you stop pointing it at me.
N: Simon aims the other way, out the window. As they drive through an intersection, they pass a car full of LOCALS.
C: MARCUS
D: Floor. Floor!
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Simon throws the gun to the floor. Marcus flinches, expecting it to go off. It doesn't. He checks the rear-view mirror. No trouble. Simon picks up the gun again.
C: SIMON
D: I've never held a real gun before. It's heavier than I thought.
C: MARCUS
D: Great, put it back.
C: SIMON
D: I want to know if it's loaded. How do I...
N: He starts pulling and pushing on it, trying to get the clip out. He's not going to stop until he does it or shoots himself trying.
C: MARCUS
D: Hold the wheel.
N: Marcus removes the clip, hands it over. Simon counts the bullets.
C: SIMON
D: I hold ten men's lives in my hand.

C: MARCUS
D: Listen up. They're going to ask if you want buy a bottle of champagne. You don't, but don't say that right off.
C: SIMON
D: Explain.
C: MARCUS
D: Champagne means you want a private dance. You can't afford it, neither can I. But if they know we're not biting, they don't even dangle the bait.

S: INT. THE CRAZY HORSE - NIGHT
N: Pitch black except for tiny Christmas lights. To Simon's left, a skanky MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE plays video poker. At the bar, Marcus SHOUTS to the BARTENDER -- the MUSIC is deafening. Out of the shadows, two dancers approach. They split up, blonde HOLLY taking Simon, while brunette NOELLE heads for Marcus. Holly offers Simon a hand, they shake. She leans close to talk into his ear. He smiles. Noelle taps Marcus on the shoulder, ducks to the other side playfully. Takes a sip of his drink. Simon points to Marcus. Holly nods, feeling the fabric of his shirt. Noelle laughs at something Marcus said. Holly measures her hand against Simon's, rubs it against her neck. He is staring at her magnificent breasts. At Noelle's urging, Marcus flexes his bicep. Noelle flutters. We come in CLOSE as Holly leans over to say something. Simon speaks first...
C: SIMON
D: I'd like to buy your most expensive bottle of champagne.
S: INT. SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: A curtain at the end, blue light overhead. Holly leads the way with a bottle of champagne. Noelle follows with glasses. Behind them, the guys. Marcus gives Simon a look. Simon shrugs it off. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) The curtain parts, letting the women through. From the darkened space beyond, a giant BOUNCER steps out -- massive even compared to Marcus. He's sucking on a lollipop.
C: VIC JR.
D: I need a major credit card.
N: Marcus looks to Simon, who hands over the gold card. Vic Jr. reads them the boilerplate...
C: VIC JR.

N: He pulls back the curtain.
S: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
N: A mirrored ball spins overhead, stars racing across the black paneling. Holly nudges Simon into his chair. He and Marcus sit back to back. As the champage POPS, we move into a series of overlapping shots: Noelle licks the foam from Holly's fingers. Holly rubs the bottle against herself, pours. Noelle and Holly dance together, a tinsel ribbon around them. Simon adjusts himself in the crotch. Noelle lights a cigar for Marcus as Holly dances alone. Holly lifts her miniskirt to reveal a g-string. Simon cranes his neck back, banging heads with Marcus. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Noelle takes a puff off the cigar. Holly straddles Simon, rubs against him. He shudders. His hands start to rise. She gently pushes them back down. Marcus whispers something to Noelle. Noelle comes up behind Holly, moving with her as she rubs against Simon. Marcus turns to watch. Enraptured, Simon watches the four-armed woman on top of him. His fingers start to twitch. Noelle kisses the edge of Holly's neck. Simon's hands rise, reach... Holly MOANS... And suddenly... Simon grabs Noelle's ass. It's Heaven.
C: NOELLE
D: Hands! Hands!
E: yelling
N: Noelle and Holly both get off him. Holly kicks his leg. From behind the curtain, Vic Jr. charges in. He heads straight for Marcus.
C: NOELLE
D: The other one!
N: Simon tumbles off his chair, scrambling.
C: VIC JR.
D: What the fuck did I tell you!
N: He kicks Simon in the ass.
C: MARCUS
D: Yo. Yo! He fucked up, he lost control.

D: I'm not trying to throw down here.
C: VIC JR.
D: You think you can kick my ass?
E: another shove
C: MARCUS
D: I don't want to try.
N: Vic Jr. WHACKS Marcus, an old-fashioned bitch slap. A beat. Marcus tries to keep the rage down. Feels his nose bleeding. He backs away, but Vic Jr. keeps coming. Suddenly... A GUNSHOT. SCREAMS. For a beat, no one's sure what happened. We look around to Marcus. Vic Jr. Holly. Noelle. Then finally Simon. He just fired. The gun is steady in his hand. Marcus checks his shirt. A spray of blood. Vic Jr. checks his arm. It's bleeding. We HOLD for a moment, the mirrored ball still spinning overhead.
C: SIMON
D: Everybody back the fuck away.
N: They do. Marcus holds his place.
C: MARCUS
D: Oh, man. Fuck.
N: Blood is squirting out of Vic Jr.'s arm. He holds it, dumbfounded. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: SIMON
D: Is there another way out?
E: to Holly
C: HOLLY
D: Behind you.
N: A fire escape door. Simon motions for Marcus to come. Pushing the bar, no alarm sounds. They back out, into the night. The door swings shut. A beat. Suddenly, an MAN charges in with a silver .45. He is Vic Sr., 60, owner and proprietor. You don't fuck with Victor.
C: VICTOR
D: What happened!
C: HOLLY
D: They shot Vic. They went out the back.
N: Victor KICKS the door open, ready to fire. The alley is clear. The BARTENDER comes through the curtain.
C: VICTOR
D: Find them.
E: handing off gun
N: The man races out. Victor looks at his son's arm. It's bloody, but he'll live. Holly SHOUTS down the hallway.
C: HOLLY
D: Call 911.
C: VICTOR
D: No! No cops.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: The Ferrari SCRAPES as it takes the curb too fast. From the alley, the Bartender chases after it, finally stopping to squeeze off three SHOTS. None seem to hit. The Ferrari tears down the street.
S: INT. FERRARI / DRIVING - NIGHT
N: Taking a left, Marcus slows down a little. We're on an empty street well away from the Crazy Horse. He dabs at his bloody nose. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) In the passenger seat, Simon looks at the gun in the hand. He suddenly throws it out.
C: MARCUS
D: What are you doing?
C: SIMON
D: Getting rid of the weapon.
N: Marcus slams on the brakes.
C: MARCUS
D: It has your fingerprints on it.
C: SIMON
D: Oh shit.
N: Craning around, Simon looks for it in the street. Marcus backs the car up. Suddenly, a phone RINGS. Lights flicker on the car phone.
C: SIMON
D: Do we answer?
N: Marcus brakes again. The phone keeps RINGING.
C: MARCUS
D: It's probably Orange County asking where the hell his car is.
C: SIMON
D: It's a cell phone. They can trace where we are even if we don't answer.
C: MARCUS
D: Get the gun. Go. Find it.
N: Simon climbs out and starts looking, crouching to look under cars. In the Ferrari, Marcus sits back and kicks the phone with his boot, over and over until it stops, dead. For a moment, silence. Then the car's ALARM starts going off. Marcus SCREAMS with frustration. He punches buttons on the keychain, but nothing will quiet it. He tries the key in the ignition. It won't turn over. Climbing out of the car, he kicks it with all his might. Simon finds the gun, crawling under a truck to get it. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Using his jacket, Marcus starts frantically wiping off the inside and outside of the Ferrari. Simon joins him. The whole time, the alarm is still WAILING. Satisfied, Marcus motions that they're done. He and Simon take off running down the street.
S: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: A bent needle pierces two flaps of skin, drawing a line of blood with the thread. Victor ties another stitch in Vic Jr.'s arm. He's had practice at this. In the background, the Bartender and Noelle are watching. Victor's tirade is directed at all of them.
C: VICTOR

I have to get out before this all just falls in on me. Vic Jr. winces with pain. VICTOR [CONT'd] You know what wakes me up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat? You aren't any worse than anyone else of your fucked up generation. Towel. Noelle hands him a towel to mop up the blood. VICTOR [CONT'd] In the old days, you know how you got to the top? By being better than the guy ahead of you. (MORE) "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) VICTOR [CONT'd] (cont'd) How do you people get to the top? By being so fucking incompetent that the guy ahead of you can't even do his job, he falls on his ass and congratulations, you're on top. Only now the top is down here when it used to be up here and you don't even know the difference. He finishes the last stitch, tying it off. VICTOR [CONT'd] My generation, we're dinosaurs. We're gonna die. You're gonna kill us off. But you'll never be dinosaurs. You're little fucking rats and that's all you're ever going to be. Holly looks in, holding a gold card. Victor motions, "well?" She hands it over.

N: Simon furiously pounds the elevator button. With a DING, doors finally open. He and Marcus get on. The doors shut. In the same shot, we WHIP BACK to look at the lobby, where Victor and Vic Jr. have just entered. They walk calmly but quickly.

N: The boy nods. Marcus drops him. Simon opens the hallway door a crack. It's clear. On the count of three, they go. We stay with the boy, who sits back against the windows, excited and rich. There's a KNOCK at the adjoining door. The boy tucks the money away. With a BOOM, we hear the door being kicked open. It only takes four blows.

Not slowing, Simon aims for the entrance lane, where the bar is coming down behind a small Nissan. Threading the needle, Simon makes it past the car and the gate. The Ram Charger smashes through the bar.
S: 105B EXT. PARKING RAMP - NIGHT 105B
N: The Cadillac charges out of the parking lot, nearly hitting another car as it heads onto the Strip. Looking back, we see the Ram Charger following them out.
S: EXT. FLAMINGO ROAD - NIGHT

S: 106A INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 106A
C: MARCUS
D: Cop. Cop!
N: There's a police car waiting at the stoplight. Simon hits the brakes, just short of a SQUEAL. They stop in a middle lane, next to the cop. Simon and Marcus look over to the OFFICER, trying to be calm. Singh and Tiny peer out the back. The Ram Charger slowly approaches, no hurry. In the squad car, the Officer takes a radio call. Drunken TOURISTS walk past. The crosswalk switches to a flashing red hand.
C: SIMON
D: How did they find us?
C: MARCUS
D: It's their town. I'm sure they have people.
N: The Ram Charger pulls in right behind the Cadillac. It's so tall, all we see are the blinding headlights through the back window. Singh and Tiny slink down. Marcus checks the gun on his lap.
C: 71A.
D: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions 106A CONTINUED: 106A
E: SALMON
N: The red hand stops flashing. The opposing light goes from green to yellow. Simon gently REVS the engine. Suddenly, a WHOOP. Lights flashing, the police car makes a right turn from the left lane, cutting in front of them. The SIREN is deafening. Simon sees his opportunity. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 106A CONTINUED: (2) 106A Gunning the engine, he hangs a hard left, cutting across three oncoming lanes. The Ram Charger tries to follow, but the traffic is already moving. Over the protest of many HORNS, the pickup finally forces its way through.
S: EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT
N: The Cadillac takes a corner hard, fishtailing into oncoming traffic. Tiny SCREAMS. Simon pulls it back into the lane. In the rear-view mirror, we see the Ram Charger, gaining.
C: MARCUS
D: We have to get off the major streets. Take a right up here. No, not here!
N: It's too late. Simon mistook an alley for an actual road.
C: SIMON
D: Hold on.
N: Aiming for the alley, Simon hits a curb on the way in. Singh's head BANGS against the roof. The passenger-side mirror smashes off against the wall.
C: TINY
D: Mother of fuck!
S: EXT. VERY NARROW ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Just inches of clearance on either side, the alley runs behind a series of strip malls and office buildings. There's only one way out -- Simon's aiming for the boulevard on the far side.
C: SINGH
D: I don't see `em.
E: looking out back
N: 108A UP AHEAD 108A The end of the alley approaches. From the far edge, a flashing orange light. A giant street-sweeper is slowly crossing the alley. We WHIP BACK to see the Cadillac approaching.

D: Shit.
C: SINGH
D: Wait, no. They're coming in.
E: looking back
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 108A CONTINUED: 108A Behind them, the Ram Charger gingerly negotiates a three-point turn into the alley. Wider, it scrapes against one side. Ahead, the street sweeper is blocking one-quarter of the alley. One-third. A moment of hesitation, then Simon floors it. The Caddy hits thirty, forty. Engine RACING --
C: MARCUS
D: We can't make it!
N: The sweeper is already halfway across the alley. Singh braces for impact. Somehow, Simon still thinks he can clear it.
C: MARCUS
D: STOP!
N: At the last moment, Simon SLAMS on the brakes. They're skidding towards it. Marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it. The front bumper catches the wall, sending the trunk SLAMMING against the far alley wall. A ear-piercing SCREECH. A ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are scraped away. Forward momentum finally stops.
S: INT. THE CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: The abrupt stop sends Tiny flying into the front seat, where his head SMACKS against the dash. Marcus's seat breaks, PINNING him. He pushes back, but Singh YELPS in protest. Simon blinks, trying to figure out if he's alive. With Tiny's bleeding head on his lap, he shifts into reverse.
S: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
N: The tires SPIN in place. The car is wedged in tight sideways. Further down the alley, we find the broken-off SIDE MIRROR. In its cracked face we see five Ram Chargers approaching. A giant tire smashes the mirror to bits. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
S: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: Shifting gears, Simon tries to rock the car back and forth, making no progress. Looking over his seat, Marcus sees the giant pickup heading right for them. The headlights are bright enough to cast shadows. Forcing back the seat, Marcus stands up through the open sunroof. Aims and FIRES. Once. Twice. Three times.
S: INT. RAM CHARGER - NIGHT
N: On the first shot, Vic Junior ducks down. Two bullets punch through the windshield. The third ricochets off the hood. Victor keeps the pedal to the floor. He's not stopping.
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: All four guys duck just before impact. The Ram Charger CRUNCHES into the side of the Cadillac, pushing it down the alley. More sparks shoot off as it goes. Looking ahead, the street sweeper has moved past the end of the alley, but the far side of the street beyond is a construction area, flashing baricades all around. The Ram Charger will push them right into it.
S: 113A INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT 113A
N: Clearing the end of the alley, Simon punches the gas.
S: 113B EXT. STREET - NIGHT 113B

N: Hitting a parked car, the Ram Charger tips and rolls over, landing on its side. It SCRAPES along the asphalt, finally coming to rest.
S: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: Simon fights to regain control, the street outside a blur. Over his shoulder, an oncoming Yugo can't stop fast enough. The little car hits just in front of the tire, sending the Cadillac spinning back the opposite direction. Tiny's unconscious body flies out the passenger window. Marcus and Singh both grab hold. As Simon rights the spin, the Cadillac brushes past the green street sweeper, still humming along. Marcus and Singh pull Tiny back in, inches away from decapitation. Simon finally settles into a lane, checking the rear-view mirror. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
S: INT. ROLLED RAM CHARGER - NIGHT
N: We look through the windshield to find Victor piled on top of his son. Regaining his wits, the old man steps on Vic Jr.'s shoulder. Gets another foot into the steering wheel, climbing up to the driver's door window.

D: Just so we're clear. You stole a car, shot a bouncer, and had sex with two women?
C: TINY
D: You had sex with two women?
N: Simon ignores them, still checking his rear-view mirror.

D: Fuck Mexico. We're going home. To L.A.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: SINGH
D: Simon, think about it. If they were going to call the cops, they would have called them in Las Vegas. They just wanted us gone, and we're gone. It's over.
N: Simon checks the mirror, checks the road. With a deep breath, he tries to believe. But doesn't.
S: EXT. STREET / CRASH SCENE - DAWN

N: At her locker, Ronna misdials the combination. Frustrated, she POUNDS the locker, then re-dials. Simon approaches Ronna gingerly. We stay back with Claire, who sets to work opening a box of expired cookies. She half-listens as Ronna and Simon have their discussion at the lockers, then at the time clock. Simon follows Ronna out into the alley. Claire takes a seat atop a crappy console TV, eating an oatmeal cookie. The VOICES on the soap opera seem familiar. MALE VOICE #1 I'm not the man you're looking for. MALE VOICE #2 We both know you were on the pier. You saw what happened to Carmen.

D: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions 132A CONTINUED: 132A
E: SALMON
N: Adam motions to leave it alone. Zack won't.
C: LOOP
D: She's coming up.
E: leaning out the back room
N: Burke cracks his neck, showtime. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 132A CONTINUED: (2) 132A
C: ZACK
D: What if she isn't really a dealer though? If you just pulled her into this one thing, wouldn't that be entrapment?
C: BURKE
D: If she's making this deal, she's a dealer. Doesn't matter if its her first or her last.
N: We stay on Zack, unconvinced.
S: INT. VENICE HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Zack looks over as Burke comes out of the kitchen.
C: BURKE
D: Cerveza?
N: He hands Ronna the beer.
C: ADAM
D: Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of orange juice. It's in the car.
E: to Burke
N: Ronna has halfway figured out what's going on.
C: BURKE
D: Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that right?
C: RONNA
D: You got a bathroom?
E: suddenly
C: ADAM
D: Down the hall on the right.
C: ZACK
D: Let me show you...
N: SLOW MOTION Stepping towards Ronna, his back to Burke. He very deliberately mouths a silent...
C: ZACK
D: Go.
N: Ronna sees it. Her eyes go wider. Zack nods. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) In the background, Burke is trying to look around. Ronna turns, heading down the hall. Up above, the camera is watching. For a just a second, Zack smiles.
S: INT. VENICE HOUSE - LATER
N: Burke SLAMS Zack up against the wall, twisting an arm behind him. He kicks his feet apart, then starts to cuff him. Zack is in considerable pain.
C: BURKE
D: Now watch what I do with his wrist. I twist it away while I put on the second cuff. That way he can't go after me. He doesn't have any leverage.
E: to Adam
N: He releases his hold on Zack, his hands cuffed behind him.
C: BURKE
D: I watch all these cop shows and they never do it right. Pisses me off.
N: Loop emerges from the back room, carrying a big box of videotapes on his way out.
C: BURKE
D: Hey, feel the abs on this one.
N: He rubs Zack's stomach.
C: BURKE
D: You could scrub laundry on these.
C: LOOP
D: Full hands.
E: re: box
N: Loop pauses at the door, looking around. He's forgotten something.
C: BURKE
D: What?
N: A beat. Loop can't remember what it was.
C: LOOP
D: Nothing. I'm out of it. Merry Christmas, guys. Good to meet you.
C: 86A.
D: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions
E: SALMON
N: Adam waves. Zack nods. Loop shuts the door behind himself. Now its just the three men. An awkward beat.
C: ZACK
D: We're done, now, right? That's what we talked about. Whether or not the deal went through, we just had to do our part.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: BURKE
D: You did your part.
C: ZACK
D: Great. Well, hey. A pleasure.
E: relieved
N: He turns to the side, offering Burke his handcuffs to undo. Burke makes no motion to do so.
C: BURKE
D: Now that he's gone, there's something I wanted to ask you guys about. Sort of a proposition. See, my wife and I -- Irene, she's my wife -- we're both working on Christmas so we're gonna have Christmas dinner tonight. And I was thinking, maybe you guys would want to come over, eat some dinner with us. My wife is great, you'll love her, then I'll sign your form. How does that sound?
E: beat
N: A beat.
C: ZACK
D: Actually, you know, I had plans.
C: ADAM
D: You did?
C: ZACK
D: I do.
C: ADAM
D: With your girlfriend?
C: ZACK
D: Yes, Adam, in fact. With my girlfriend.
C: ADAM
D: Huh. Wow, I can't believe I forgot this. I saw your girlfriend this morning, and she asked me to tell you that she couldn't make your plans tonight.
E: beat; another; then suddenly
N: Zack stares at Adam, a "why are you doing this" look.
C: 87A.
D: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions
E: SALMON
C: ADAM
D: It looks like we're both free.
E: to Burke
S: EXT. A TINY HOUSE IN CULVER CITY - NIGHT
N: Zack hits the alarm for his red Miata, which BWOOPS. He and Adam walk to the door, hostility simmering. A prefab Nativity scene glows beside the front door. Adam pushes the doorbell, which CHIMES "Hark Ye Herald Angels Sing." Horrified, Zack turns to leave. Adam stops him.
S: INT. LIVING / DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Too tall for the room, a Christmas tree leans back in a corner. The rest of the living room is dominated by a giant leather sofa pit. Bored, Adam lifts a plate to check the imprint. He sets it down, straightening it. Now it's out of alignment with the other plates. He looks around casually. No one's watching. Circling the table, he fixes all the plates and moves silverware to its proper position. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Burke's wife IRENE is mashing potatoes with considerable zeal. Adam leans in, sees her dedication and tries to duck out. But she saw him.
C: IRENE
D: Yes? Hi?
C: ADAM
D: Sorry. Phone. Messages. Check?
C: IRENE
D: Here.
N: She points. He sheepishly crosses to get it. While he's dialing, Irene starts in with the electric mixer. Butter. Milk. Salt. Adam doesn't know where to look while he's listening to his messages. He suddenly smiles. Irene notices and stops mixing.
C: ADAM
D: They're singing Christmas carols. My family. Minnesota, they do that.
E: re: phone
N: She leans close to listen. Smiles. She continues to lean close -- uncomfortably close -- for a long beat.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: We hear a toilet FLUSH. Zack emerges from the bathroom to find Burke stark naked, rubbing his hands over his body.
C: ZACK
D: Sorry.
C: BURKE
D: No, stay for a sec.
N: Burke sprays more cologne on his hand.
C: BURKE
D: Smell this. What does it smell like?
N: Zack shakes his head, doesn't know.
C: BURKE
D: CK One. But it's not.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ZACK
D: Really.
C: BURKE
D: I get this for a quarter what that stuff costs.
C: ZACK
D: It's nice.
C: BURKE
D: Here.
N: He sprays some on Zack's hands, who didn't want it. While Burke turns to get some underwear, Zack tries to rub it off on the bedspread.
C: BURKE
D: It's down. So is the liner.
E: re: bedspread
C: ZACK
D: It is soft.
C: BURKE
D: Get on.
C: ZACK
D: That's okay.
N: Burke pushes Zack back flat the bed.
C: BURKE
D: Did you hear that?
C: ZACK
D: Hear what?
C: BURKE
D: Exactly. Individually wrapped springs. Top quality.
N: Burke climbs onto the bed beside him.
C: BURKE
D: I could be doing aerobics over here and you wouldn't feel it.
C: ZACK
D: I sure wouldn't.
N: A beat. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: BURKE
D: So, Zack. Would you say you're open to new things?
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Irene is back whipping the potatoes.
C: IRENE
D: Of course you like your job. You get to kiss all those pretty girls.
C: ADAM
D: It does have perks.
E: mock bashful
N: Irene pops the beaters out of the mixer, hands one to Adam. They lick the potatoes off them.
C: IRENE
D: Tell me something. When you kiss those girls, you're not really kissing them, are you?
C: ADAM
D: It's a stage kiss. Your lips touch, but there's no tongue.
C: IRENE
D: There's no feeling. Nobody gets jealous.
C: ADAM
D: It's acting. It's not real.
N: She takes his cleaned beater from him, dumps it in the sink. Turning back, she kisses him. Caught off guard, he backs into the refrigerator. It's a good three-second lip lock. She backs off. There's an awkward beat.
C: ADAM
D: See, now, that. There was a tongue there.
C: BURKE
D: Honey, red or white?
E: O.S.
N: Now dressed, Burke comes in with two bottles of wine. Zack is behind him at a distance, still creeped out from the bedroom encounter. He and Adam trade panicked stares.
C: IRENE
D: What goes with turkey?
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ADAM AND ZACK
D: White.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Irene slides a plate under the candlestick, where wax is dripping onto the tablecloth. Burke tips the bottle at Adam.
C: BURKE
D: More wine?
C: ZACK
D: No. He doesn't want any more. Unless he does, do you?
C: ADAM
D: No.
C: ZACK
D: This has been great, just wonderful, but we're going to need to leave. Soon. Adam's not feeling well.
C: ADAM
D: I'm not. It's true.
N: Burke and Irene share a look.
C: BURKE
D: If you gotta go, then I understand. But Irene and I sort of had an ulterior motive inviting you here.
E: awkward beat
N: Zack looks to Adam.
C: IRENE
D: He makes it sound sinister. It's not.
C: BURKE
D: She's right. Okay, you've looked around our place. Where do you think we got most of this stuff?
N: Adam and Zack shake their heads.
C: IRENE
D: Just guess.
C: ADAM
D: Sears?
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ZACK
D: J.C. Penney's?
N: Irene and Burke both smile.
C: BURKE
D: It's actually from Confederated Products. Almost everything in this house is from Confederated Products, from the toilet paper to the mattress to those candles.
C: IRENE
D: The wine.
C: BURKE
D: Even that cologne you liked. See, Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company. That means we don't just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and manage teams who work under us. Irene and I started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues.
E: practiced
C: IRENE
D: We're the number four distributor in Southern California. By March, we might be number three.
N: She crosses her fingers. So does Burke. We look to Zack, horrified.
C: BURKE
D: Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene and I can't recruit distributors from inside the force. It's against the rules and we'd get fired. So what we do is look for people in other industries...
C: IRENE
D: ...like the entertainment industry.
C: ZACK
D: Wait. You want us to sell Amway.
E: realizing
C: BURKE
D: Confederated Products. It's a different company, different quality of product.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Zack and Adam share a look of disbelief and wonder.
S: EXT. FRONT OF BURKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Walking to the Miata, Adam takes the keys. Zack folds a form.
C: ZACK
D: I need to do something terrifically unwholesome. I need to bathe in sin.
C: ADAM
D: With me, or one of your other boyfriends?
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE ON PICO - NIGHT
N: Adam checks a low shelf for the right brand of scotch. Zack kneels beside him.
C: ZACK
D: I have cheated on you with exactly one guy.
C: ADAM
D: Ditto.
C: ZACK
D: Who?
C: ADAM
D: No. See, if I tell you, you will freak out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it.
N: He finds the right brand. BY THE REGISTER They wait in a short line.
C: ZACK
D: I'll tell you mine.
C: ADAM
D: No.
C: ZACK
D: Why not?
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ADAM
D: You can't wait to tell me, can you? You're gloating. You think yours is better than mine.
C: ZACK
D: I don't.
C: ADAM
D: It's Sean Connery, isn't it?
C: ZACK
D: Count of three.
C: ADAM
D: Alright. Sure. Wait. Okay.
E: reconsidering
N: With fingers, they both count off "One. Two. Three." ADAM ZACK * Jimmy. Jimmy in makeup.
C: ADAM
D: Jimmy?
C: ZACK
D: Jimmy. Jimmy.
N: They both stand for a moment, bewildered. It's their turn at the register. Adam sets the bottle down. A doorbell RINGS.
S: INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: An apartment door opens to reveal a chubby girl in sweats (SANDRA) with a cordless phone and giant bowl of popcorn. She drops the former into the latter.
C: ADAM
D: Is Jimmy here?
C: SANDRA
D: Oh my God. Oh. My God.
N: She's thrilled and disbelieving at the same time. She fishes the phone out of the bowl. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: SANDRA
D: I'll call you back. Jimmy's not here. He went to this thing. Let me find it.
E: to phone to them
N: She can't decide whether to close the door on them or not, so she only shuts it halfway. She pokes her head out the door again.
C: SANDRA
D: You do know, don't you?
C: ZACK
D: We know.
C: SANDRA
D: I take no responsibilty. I was only an innocent bystander. But there was once where you missed each other by three minutes. It was so exciting.
N: She finds what she was looking for on the back of the door. Peels off a printed card.
C: SANDRA
D: It's some sort of rave thing.
C: ZACK
D: Mary Xmas Supafest.
E: takes card
C: SANDRA
D: He left an hour ago.
N: Adam and Zack head back down the hall. She calls out after them.
C: SANDRA
D: You're not going to kill him, are you? The little shit owes me rent.
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE / MARY XMAS SUPAFEST - NIGHT
N: At the doors, BOUNCERS stamp hands. We move down the line of people waiting to get in, stopping on Adam and Zack.
C: ZACK
D: Okay, I just have to say this. The thing is, about Jimmy, he wasn't even that good.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ADAM
D: I know.
C: ZACK
D: Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made, God. It was like having sex with Nell.
N: Adam imitates the MOAN.
C: ZACK
D: Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales were beaching themselves.
C: ADAM
D: And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips. That's really not necessary.
C: ZACK
D: The only thing I will give him credit for is the oral.
C: ADAM
D: What do you mean? He was terrible. At some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up.
N: A beat.
C: ZACK
D: When was that?
C: ADAM
D: October, maybe?
C: ZACK
D: Early October. And he suddenly got so much better.
N: A beat.
C: ADAM
D: That is so disturbing. It's like you were there.
S: INT. SUPAFEST - NIGHT
N: Claire cuts through the crowd with two empty cups, in search of beverage. AT THE BAR "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) A sloe-eyed blonde boy (JIMMY) makes friendly with the BARTENDER, who is too busy to flirt. Rebuffed, Jimmy scans the crowd. Zack comes up behind him, grabs him by the waist. Jimmy smiles, kisses him hello. Adam comes up from the other side, blows in Jimmy's ear. Jimmy is so coked up that it takes him a beat to make the connection. Zack plus Adam equals bad. He smiles nervously. Zack takes a pair of child safety scissors from his jacket. Confused, Jimmy tries to back away. Adam holds him tight. Grabbing a fistful of hair, Zack cuts it off at the scalp. He lets the hair fall to the floor. Tucking away the scissors, he and Adam walk off.
S: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (RAINING)
N: The tiny Miata maneuvers through the badly organized parking lot, trying to find the way out.
S: INT. MIATA - NIGHT (RAINING)
N: Zack gives directions from the passenger seat.
C: ZACK
D: Right. This right. This right! That was the right you wanted.
E: passing
N: Adam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way. A beat later, it dead-ends in a chain link fence. Zack points to his lips. He didn't say a word. Adam slams it in reverse, backtracking. He's doing about 20 when suddenly we hear a loud THUMP! By instinct, he SLAMS on the brakes. Something CRASHES down on the soft roof.
C: ZACK
D: What the fuck!
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Ronna's face suddenly slams down on the windshield, bleeding already. Both men SCREAM. Her eyes are open, staring at them. After a beat, they recognize her.
C: ZACK
D: Oh my God.
C: ADAM
D: It's...It's that girl.
C: ZACK
D: Ronna.
N: Her body continues its slide across the windshield, finally resting on the hood. In a sort of spasm, Adam REVS back, shaking the body off. It drops beyond the headlights. Zack looks past Adam to see Gaines standing there, gun drawn.
C: ZACK
D: Go. Go. Go!
C: ADAM
D: What if she's...
C: ZACK
D: Go!
N: Adam pops the clutch and they lurch backward, out of there. IN THE MIRROR Gaines steps out to watch them go.
S: EXT. FIELD / PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: We stay at ditch-level as the headlights retreat.
S: EXT. 24/7 GAS - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: The Miata is parked at the far island.
S: INT. MIATA - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: Adam steadies his hands on the wheel. Zack passes him the scotch. He takes a gulp, passes it back. The energy is still revved up to 11 -- we don't let ourselves catch a breath. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ZACK
D: Let's think about it logically. Either she's alive, or she's dead. If she's dead, then there's nothing we can do. If she's alive, then the guy with the gun, who seemed to want to shoot her, probably did shoot her.
C: ADAM
D: So even if she's alive, she's dead.
C: ZACK
D: Exactly.
N: Adam takes another drink.
C: ZACK
D: On the plus side, the only witnesses are you, me and him. And none of us are going to want to be talking about it. So if you really think about it, it didn't turn out as badly as it could have.
C: ADAM
D: A girl is dead.
C: ZACK
D: I didn't say it went perfectly.
E: snaps
N: Adam gets out of the car, walks away. Zack takes another swig.
S: EXT. SIDE OF THE GAS STATION - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: Adam stops at a payphone. A long moment before he reaches for the receiver. With a breath, he dials 911.
C: OPERATOR
D: 911 Emergen...
E: V.O.
N: He hangs up.
S: EXT. GAS STATION ISLAND - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: Zack dunks the squeegee back in the bucket. With a wad of paper towels, he cleans the hood of the car. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
S: INT. GAS STATION BATHROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: Washing his face, Adam looks at his reflection in the scratched mirror. He steps to the urinal, unbuttons. Before he can start to piss, he notices something strange. He looks down at his crotch.
S: EXT. GAS STATION ISLAND - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: Zack throws away the last of the towels as Adam approaches. With a finger to his lips, Adam holds out a mess of tape and wires, all connected to a battery pack. It's the microphone he was wearing.
C: ZACK
D: Holy sh...
N: He stops himself. Adam throws the bundle as far as he can. They keep their voices low anyway.
C: ZACK
D: They wouldn't have been listening all this time.
C: ADAM
D: Hello, they could have been recording it. Everything we said could be on tape somewhere. They would know we did it.
N: A beat.
C: ZACK
D: What if we were just running lines? For a scene?
E: an idea
N: Adam won't even dignify that with an answer. A long moment, just the BUZZ of the lights overhead. With an almost eerie calm...
C: ZACK
D: There's a pretty good chance no one's found her yet.
C: ADAM
D: They will.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ZACK
D: No. Listen. If there's no body, there's no crime.
S: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: The Supafest is still RAGING in the distance. Adam digs through the trunk of the convertible, frantically rearranging the junk inside. He keeps looking around the lid, waiting for someone to sneak up on them. Zack watches Adam's fruitless arranging efforts.
C: ZACK
D: Stop. Okay, stop!
C: ADAM
D: What?
C: ZACK
D: It's a Miata.
N: All Adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. Maybe.
C: ZACK
D: We'll put her in the passenger seat.
C: ADAM
D: Where will I...Or you...
C: ZACK
D: In the passenger seat. Holding her up.
N: Adam shudders at the thought. With a flashlight, Zack jumps down into the ditch. He nudges Ronna's body with his foot. She's dead alright. He rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. He tries to hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.
C: ZACK
D: Little help?
C: ADAM
D: I can't.
E: not moving
C: ZACK
D: What do you mean?
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ADAM
D: I can't do this.
N: Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do it by himself. Meanwhile, Adam is starting to hyperventilate, tears swelling.
C: ZACK
D: Okay, listen to me...
C: ADAM
D: She's dead.
C: ZACK
D: She's not dead.
C: ADAM
D: She's dead. I hit her and I killed her.
N: He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them.
C: ZACK
D: No you didn't, okay? This is all just make-believe. This is a scene. She's just acting dead. And you're just acting scared.
N: Adam laughs to himself, still crying.
C: ZACK
D: See, there's the lights, and there's the camera. Watch your blocking. There's Michelle in wardrobe, say "Hi, Michelle!"
E: pointing
C: ADAM
D: Hi, Michelle.
C: ZACK
D: The craft service truck is right around the corner, and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill. And you can have one if you just help me finish this scene. Can you smell them? Can you smell them on the grill?
E: sniffing
N: A beat.
C: ADAM
D: I'm not delusional.
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)
C: ZACK
D: Then take her fucking arms!
N: Obeying, Adam grabs Ronna's wrists as Zack pushes from below. Together they get the body out of the ditch. Zack climbs up to help maneuver her into the car. Just then... Ronna MOANS. Adam freaks out, dropping his side. Ronna's head hits the dirt. Louder MOANING.
C: ADAM
D: She's not dead.
C: ZACK
D: No shit!
N: They stand back, watching Ronna MOAN as she lies half-in, half- out of the car.
C: ADAM
D: If she's not dead, that means we didn't kill her. We can just leave her.
C: ZACK
D: She's almost dead. We leave her and she dies, why did we bother coming back? I mean, you still killed her.
C: ADAM
D: What do you mean, I killed her?
C: ZACK
D: Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon. I would never testify against you.
N: Adam is not reassured.
C: ZACK
D: We have to stick with Plan A.
C: ADAM
D: In Plan A she was dead.
N: Zack reaches into the car, pulling out The Club. Trades a look with Adam, who finally acquieces. Almost says something, doesn't. They both look around, making sure no one's coming. Zack grips the bar like a baseball bat. Adam turns his back, covering his ears. Zack raises the bar. Adam scrunches his face tight. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Zack takes two quick breaths. And holds. And holds. And holds. Adam opens his eyes, looks back. Zack isn't swinging. He lowers the bar. They both breathe again, relieved.
C: ZACK
D: Okay. New plan.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: A CAR ALARM drones incessantly, the siren interrupted with an occasional
C: CAR ALARM VOICE
D: Back away from the vehicle.
N: Weaving through some parked cars, we settle on an angry BMW, its lights flashing. A small throng of RAVERS have gathered around to look, because Ronna's limp body lies on the hood. A familiar face pushes through the crowd, just arrived.
C: FILA GUY
D: Hey, it's Kelly. Somebody beat the crap out of her.
N: Moving to find...
C: SKATE-PUNK GUY
D: Somebody call an ambulance!
N: After a beat, he realizes he should do it himself. He takes off running. ADAM AND ZACK look around from the edge of a van in the distance.
C: ZACK
D: Look, she's fine. They're getting an ambulance. She's fine.
N: Adam keeps watching, not convinced. He turns back, a thought...
C: ADAM
D: What about that guy? The guy with the gun. He could still go after her.
C: 104A.
D: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions
E: SALMON
C: ZACK
D: Okay, listen. Girl in ditch -- that's our problem. Girl out of ditch -- that's her own problem. We're done. We did the right thing.
N: Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Off Adam's look...
C: ZACK
D: Okay, approximately the right thing. In a half-assed, thrown-together fashion.
N: Adam smiles despite himself. Zack points, "See? See?" That just makes Adam smile more.
C: ZACK
D: Home?
C: ADAM
D: Home.
N: As they walk off, we leave the Mary Xmas Supafest still BLARING in the distance.
S: INT. JAVAMAN CAFE / HOLLYWOOD - DAY
N: Too early for the brunch crowd, just a smattering of vampires. All around, Christmas lights are strung with mad abandon. The lights overhead FLICKER. Everyone looks up. That's when we come to find TODD GAINES sitting alone at a booth by the window, disassembling a newspaper. He finds the comics. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) Laying the paper flat, he tears off the bottom corner of the page and starts reading like a kid, his whole body leaning over the table. At the door, Claire comes in, shaking the rain out of her hair. After a beat, she does it again, as if she doesn't remember doing it the first time. She's tired and wired, all nerves and raw edges. There's static only she can feel. She looks right past Gaines, out to the rain on the street. He watches her, but doesn't try to catch her eye. The Jamaican WAITER walks past her with a pot of coffee.
C: WAITER
D: Anywhere you want.
C: CLAIRE
D: I'm meeting people.
N: He doesn't care. Claire takes a seat at the table in front of her, but it's not to her liking. Then a booth. She plays with the salt shakers. Bad. It's only now that she sees Gaines watching her. At first she doesn't recognize him. Then a light goes on. She climbs over the booth and into his, facing him.
C: CLAIRE
D: Hey.
C: GAINES
D: Hey.
C: CLAIRE
D: We're twins.
N: She turns over his hand, compares it to hers. They both have the same ink stamp on the back. He's busted, no way to talk himself out. The Waiter comes with coffee, refills Gaines' cup. Claire overturns the cup in front of her. The Waiter fills it. She overturns a second cup, points to it. A big weird smile. Reluctantly, the Waiter fills that too. Then leaves.
C: CLAIRE
D: I'll pay you back for breakfast. Don't worry. I'm not really that hungry.

D: See, when we go out, we always meet here afterwards in case we get separated.
E: MORE
N: "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) CLAIRE (cont'd) It happens more than you'd think. I've been paging her, but she hasn't called back. The lights FLICKER again, storm still raging. Halfway into getting her coat off, Claire has second thoughts, but continues nonetheless. Gaines is taken off-balance, his private space violated. Claire finally looks up at Gaines, smiles. A beat.
C: CLAIRE
D: Unless you wanted to eat alone.
C: GAINES
D: No. It's fine.
S: 157A INT. CAFE - LATER 157A
N: Gaines scrapes the last of his eggs off the plate. Claire sits with two pieces of toast, untouched. She takes the scrap of the newspaper he tore off, looks at it.
C: CLAIRE
D: What do you have against The Family Circus?
C: GAINES
D: It's evil.
C: CLAIRE
D: Besides that.
C: GAINES
D: Okay. Location mostly. Bottom right corner, just waiting there to suck. It's the last thing you read, and it spoils everything you read before it.
C: CLAIRE
D: You could just not read it.
C: GAINES
D: I hate it, yet I'm uncontrollably drawn to it. Are you going to...

C: CLAIRE
D: I'm serious.
C: GAINES
D: Professional curiousity. What are you on?

C: CLAIRE
D: You know what I like best about Christmas? The surprises. It's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it. You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here.
N: She smiles. She has a bewitching smile.
C: CLAIRE
D: I'm not saying this is anything it's not. But, c'mon. This time yesterday, who'dda thunk it?
S: INT. STAIRWELL TO GAINES' APARTMENT - DAY
N: Claire kisses Gaines, pinning him against the wall. Rain BEATS against the door. She fumbles with his belt. His hand slides under her jacket, trying to undo her bra. They take a break from undressing to kiss harder. Reclining on the steps, Claire tries to push his jeans down with her toes. Her foot gets caught in the chain from his wallet. Her butt slides down a step. They laugh. Her hand hits something hard -- his gun. It's tucked into his jacket pocket. As they start to work up a rhythm, Huxley the cat comes down the steps, curious. He brushes against them, unnoticed. Finally, he MEWS.
C: GAINES
D: How did you get out?
E: stopping
N: He looks to the top of the stairs, where a MAN is watching them. It's Victor. "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) He has the silver .45 drawn on them. Gaines looks down to the door at the bottom. Vic Jr. is blocking it. They're trapped. Claire looks around, trying to figure out what's happening. 159 - 167 OMIT 159 - 167

S: INT. APARTMENT - LATER
N: Sitting in the green chair, Simon makes an `X' on his bicep with a marker. He feels for the bone.
C: SIMON
D: It's all flesh here, it should be okay.
N: Gaines and the Vics stand around him. In the background, Claire is dubious and horrified. Vic Jr. puts Todd's gun to the `X.' Gaines hands Simon a shirt to mop up the blood.
C: SIMON
D: Right, great.
N: On some sick level, he's really into this. Vic Jr. gets ready to shoot. Everyone subtly backs away, bracing for the gunshot. Three. Two. One. But there's no bang. * Everyone looks at Vic Jr. He pulls the gun away. * VIC JR. * I can't. * "GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) VICTOR VIC JR. * What do you mean you can't?

S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
N: Ronna wakes up, a bit at a time, an IV dripping overhead. We hear carolers SINGING in the distance. Her nose crinkles, her tongue finds her lips. Finally a swollen eye opens, looks around. A MEXICAN FAMILY is gathered around the other bed in the room, the father dressed as Santa Claus. Ronna sees the IV dangling from her arm. She sits up with difficulty, a head rush. She tries to get her bearings, but genuinely doesn't know how she got here. After a beat, she rips off the tape and carefuly pulls the needle out of her arm.

C: RONNA
D: Claire.
N: Nothing. A beat. Finally...
C: RONNA
D: Alright. Mistakes were made. Things didn't go exactly as planned.
N: Claire's eyes -- understatement.
C: RONNA [CONT'D]
D: But it wasn't exactly a banner night for me, either.
N: Claire stops, disbelieving -- if Ronna only knew. She turns on her, then back to the register, holding it in. But she just has to face her to say...
C: CLAIRE
D: You are constantly using us.
C: RONNA
D: Using you? You use me. Come on, if it weren't for me, you would be sitting home every night eating popcorn and watching reruns of 90210.

N: All the alleys look the same. He could be anywhere.
S: EXT. BEHIND A DUMPSTER - DAY
N: A stray black cat scratches through a pile of foam peanuts, looking for bugs. Another cat crawls up the body of Mannie, propped against the dumpster. A trickle of water drips off the garbage onto his face. The cat licks it clean. Mannie smiles.

C: RONNA
D: Mannie! Can you hear me?
C: MANNIE
D: Yeah!

S: INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Simon awakes to POUNDING at the front door. He stands and turns, disoriented, no idea when or where he is. He finally finds a clock -- it's 4:14 in the afternoon. More POUNDING at the door. Simon half-crawls to the window, looking out to see who's at the door. HIS P.O.V. From this angle, all we can see is the sleeve of a man's jacket.
C: SIMON
D: Who is it?
E: tentatively
N: He ducks, expecting a hail of gunfire.
C: MALE VOICE [O.S.]
D: It's Todd.
N: A beat, then Simon finally drops his panic. He keeps the gun in hand as he pulls the chair away from the doorknob and slowly undoes the lock. He leaves the chain on. Looking out through the crack, we see Gaines, alone.
C: SIMON
D: Jesus, Todd. Thank God. You won't believe the shit I've been through...
E: undoes chain
N: Without a word, Gaines grabs him by the collar and SMASHES him, one punch to the face. Simon falls in a dazed lump to the floor. We stay down with him as we watch Gaines walk away. Simon blinks and sniffles as we once again

A quiet beat, the first moment of genuine affection between them. Suddenly we hear a BEEPING. We can't tell where it's coming from. Following the sound, Adam finds a mud-encrusted beeper wedged between the seat and the center console. He looks up to Zack, then checks the number.

C: JIMMY SHUBERT
D: Somethin' about it just didn't add up. So last night I went back to the pier to do some investigating of my own. Turns out there are two boats named the Princess. Only, one just got back from two weeks at sea -- Sal Dominico's boat. It got me thinkin' -- if Chase really did know Carmen was on to him, how come he didn't tell Lucas, or Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by himself? And why would you still have his briefcase? Answer me that, Danielle. If you have an answer.
